            "content": "Detective stories never go out of fashion, but finding a way to make them interesting is another matter entirely. Some leave things open to interpretation, whilst others rely on convoluted mysteries that are more difficult to follow than a city street map. There are also whole bodies of work dedicated to the exploits of well known sleuths like Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Inspector Morse and more.\r\nSo what was the great innovation brought forth by the anime industry? Why loli detectives of course!\r\nOriginally a light novel series by Sakuraba Kazuki, Gosick (which may be a play on the word \"Gothic\"), is set in thefictional European country of Sauville where Kujo Kazuya, the third son of a high ranking officer in the Japanese Imperial Army, begins attending the prestigious St. Marguerite Academy. He quickly discovers that almost everybody in the country is enamoured with tales of the supernatural, and one of the strangest tells of a golden fairy who lives at the top of a tower ...\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is generally well constructed and the basic premise is actually quite interesting, so it's unfortunate that the narrative is a bit too linear for the majority of the series. In addition to this there are several rather blatant attempts at moving the story forward by inserting some obvious tokens into specific episodes, many of which could have been handled in a far more subtle manner.\\n\\n\r\nA major issue when adapting a written work into a visual form is that it will undoubtedly lose something in the process, and that seems to be the case here. Part of the problem stems from the fact that certain aspects of a given story will lose a degree of mystery once they're converted into an image, and this is even more prevalent in animation. While experienced authors are able to hide certain clues or foreshadowing elements in a body of text, once the story is adapted for anime the differentiation between foreground and background becomes far more pronounced. This has the effect of \"highlighting\" the more important parts of certain scenes, and when taken in conjunction with the linear plot, it makes several of the seemingly impossible to solve mysteries relatively easy to deduce.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there is quite a bit of sleuthing going on, and the variety of cases on offer should tickle the fancy of many a mystery buff.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the series is set in 1920's Europe, Gosick has a very continental look to it that's reflected in the clothing, buildings, and even modes of transportation, and the majority of the background artwork is implemented rather well. There has also been a decent attempt at giving the majority of the characters a vaguely European caste to their features, and this can sometimes contrast nicely with the somewhat stereotypical design used for Kujo. The one oddity is Victorique as everything from her height to her clothing is very different to that of everyone around her, which raises an interesting thought. Gosick is, at heart, a detective drama, and in the spirit of tradition the leading sleuth must have something that visibly sets them apart from everyone else. In this case, it's a loli wearing ruffles, lace, and a charming array of bonnets.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty decent for the most part, and the majority of character movements have been implemented rather well. Unfortunately Bones haven't really pushed the boat out with this anime so there are a few telltale signs of inattention here and there.\\n\\n\r\nGosick features a variety of classically themed background music, and while the majority of the tracks reflect the serious tone of the show, there are a few lighthearted pieces scattered here and there. The opening theme, Destin Histoire by Yoshiki\u2606Lisa, is a J-pop/rock song that seems a bit too action oriented for a series that relies more on utilising the character's brains instead of their brawn. In addition to this the stylised montage that accompanies it drops a few too many hints about events that occur in the story, which is unfortunate as otherwise it's a well made and choreographed piece of work. As for the two ending themes by Komine Lisa, Resuscitated Hope (episodes 1 to 12), is a pop ballad that seems to fit better with the tone of Gosick, both musically and in terms of the visuals used for the end sequence. The second song, Unity, is the one that stands out the most as it's far more melancholy and dramatic than the other two tracks, and the accompanying imagery reflects the darker turn the series takes after the halfway point.\\n\\n\r\nThe acting is pretty decent for the most part, with Yuuki Aoi and Eguchi Takuya performing rather well in the roles of Victorique and Kujo (and it's actually surprising to find a tsundere loli that isn't being played by Kugumiya Rie). The rest of the cast also handle their roles passing well, but like so many other titles out there, the script could have been done better. The dialogue is sometimes childish or stunted, and there's a lack of cohesiveness that appears during several conversations which can make the characters seem ... lacking.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the biggest surprise in Gosick is that there's actually a fair degree of justification for Victorique being not only a loli, but also tsundere. Kujo is the typical \"blank canvas\" used in so many anime to highlight just how much he develops by the end of the series, but in all honesty neither of the leads is anything really special. The fun actually starts when one looks at the supporting characters as there's literally a wealth of personalities and ambitions on display. While there is some growth to be found for both Victorique and Kujo, it's the amount of characterisation that has gone into the minor roles that makes this series interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the show does sometimes play fast and loose with certain events, and there are several occasions where the situation has clearly been contrived to develop a particular character in a certain way.\\n\\n\r\nGosick may have its flaws, but that doesn't mean it's a terrible show. There's a decent amount of detective work in the series that raises it above the likes of Tantei Opera Milky Holmes and Hidan No Aria, and while the mysteries on offer can sometimes be easy to deduce, there are also a few that contains some interesting twists on the stories that they've inspired. That said, this isn't an anime for everyone, mainly because it relies more on the characters using their heads rather than the usual shounen tactic of solving problems by hitting them until they've gone away. In addition to this the element of romance in the story can often feel more like an afterthought, something added to give the characters a bit of added dimension.\\n\\n\r\nSomewhat surprisingly, I found that I enjoyed this anime a lot more than I thought I would. The idea of loli detectives is no more laughable than that of a little old lady, an author of crime fiction, or even a mouse, and once I got over my initial aversion I found a show that was interesting at the very least.  That doesn't mean I'm sold on the idea though, but that's mainly because of shows like Milky Holmes and Hidan No Aria, which really haven't done the concept any favours.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, at least Gosick tries to redress the balance.",

            "content": "Overall - 9\r\nIf you are looking for a good detective series, this is not the show you are looking for. Gosick is not a detective show. It is a historical fiction that tells the story of Ministry of the Occult\u2019s attempt to maintain political power against the rise of science. Victorique, the heroine, solves minor mysteries in a Sherlock Holmes manner throughout the show. As Ridiculous as they may seem at first, the resolutions of these mysteries foreshadow events crucial to the actual plot. Although the conflict is not obvious until the second half of the season, it is present from the first episode.\r\nAnother importantnote to mention is that the show is also a romance. I would put it akin to Toradora. The romantic plot is important to the overarching plot, but it does not take priority over it. If you don\u2019t like romance, you can still like this show. If you want a good love story, you still get that.\\n\\n\r\nGosick gets very dark towards the end, as the overarching plot becomes noticeable. There are scenes filled with action, especially towards the end. Every episode build suspense and questions; as the show comes to a close, it does not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nThe staff of Gosick takes the unimportant details seriously. Minor characters have a lot of personality and perform their roles decently. The background art is among the best of any show I have seen. Every little thing was given time and effort by the staff, and that is one of the best parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love music, this show doesn\u2019t have the world\u2019s greatest soundtrack. However, the music is still very good, especially in the opening and ending themes. As a warning, endings change at episode 13. Being a huge fan of the first ending, the second was a shock, as it is not nearly as good. It is still a very good song, once you\u2019ve hear it a few times. The in show music could be better.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe lead role of the show is a Japanese exchange student Kazuya Kujou. Kujou is an intelligent, albeit na\u00efve, student. He trusts the myths of his host country, Sauville, but does not become entranced by them like the students of that land. In his home country, he is considered a pansy; in many ways he is, but there are times when he has plenty of courage. He is not a toughened warrior at all times, but when other people\u2019s lives are in danger, he steps in the path of bullets. Although Gosick is not narrated, Kujou seems to take that role. Whenever the viewer is left in the dark, so is he. Whenever the view would be confused, so is he. When the show journeys into the supernatural, even Kujou keeps it tied to reality.\\n\\n\r\nVictorique is the character that causes people to label Gosick as a detective series. People present her with cases, sometimes unintentionally, and she solves them within moments. She constantly acts bored and rarely shows any emotions at the beginning. Her history is a mystery that is uncovered bit by bit after each case she solves. The only thing that is obvious in the first few episodes is that Kujou causes Victorique to change. She becomes more social and emotional. Her character changes so much over the course of the show that she looks dramatically different at the end than at the beginning (literally and figuratively \u2013 although the literal change is to emphasize the figurative). The changes make sense with the story, and do not distract the viewer at all.\\n\\n\r\nEach supporting character has a clear cut personality. Even one shot characters have histories explained briefly without distracting from the plot. This is one of the best aspects of the show. The minor characters fulfill their roles well. Grevil de Blois, the only real detective in the series, plays a complex part. He often becomes an obstacle to the main characters, but sometimes he aides them by following or ignoring his superior\u2019s orders. He changes as much as Victorique as the show progresses. Although Grevil is the strongest support, almost none of the others can be done without.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not as picky on grading characters as I am with other sections. I am willing to give 10\u2019s to multiple shows, not just the best. There are requirements to get this score. The cast must be well developed, have purpose in the plot, and fulfill their roles properly. Gosick is one of few shows where I could not find a character I did not like. That being said, there are characters I wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with if they existed. In fact, that is the reason I\u2019d give this show such a good score here. I think that every single one of these characters could exist, because they are developed enough to have realistic personalities.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nThe first half of the Gosick has lots of little mysteries that seem to have little relevance to the entire plot. Also, for someone expecting a detective show, these mysteries are a bit disappointing. Very little work is done in the actual investigative fields, and Victorique solves these mysteries quickly. While many people would find her evidence a bit farfetched, it is fitting for the overall plot of the show. Victorique claims that she puts together the chaos around her using a \u201cwellspring of wisdom.\u201d This is a horrible way to end any mystery arc, if you want a show like Columbo, Monk, or Law and Order. However, this does not hurt Gosick at all. After all, this show is not a detective series; it is a historical fiction. The first few mysteries help develop the characters and foreshadow the important plot points that come later on in the show. Each minor event has relevance to the story, but it does not become noticeable until the second half.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first half, the last episodes are full of minor mysteries. At this point in the show, these mysteries are no longer random. The cases from the first half have gained relevance to the overarching plot. The new mysteries reveal the most important details of the history within the show. Victorique\u2019s past is revealed. The conflict becomes overt. This is an important point in the show; the viewer can see that the conflict has always been present, but no one knows exactly what it is until Kujou discovers it. Also, it proves that the show is not a detective story. Although the heroine is treated as a detective, she does not change the show. The conflict of a detective show is always the same; the leads must discover how an event happened, and who caused it to happen. In the case of Gosick, the conflict present in the overarching plot is completely different: the Ministry of the Occult\u2019s final attempts to maintain political power against the Academy of Science.\\n\\n\r\nThe presence of the supernatural is important for the plot of Gosick. Myths and superstitions help keep the Ministry of the Occult in power. The ignorant populace responds to mystical evidence before the scientific. Victorique offers scientific theories to cases, but she creates them through unlikely means. These theories also make sense when she says them, but they seem mythical as well. This makes Victorique the focal character; she contains elements of the Occult and science in her. She represents both sides equally.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the show feels rushed. The last episode is forced to switch between several characters, locations and times that it is hard to understand what is going on. While it isn\u2019t the smoothest finish ever, it still ends the story well. The conflict between the Occult and science is resolved properly without anything being rushed. The resolutions of all the characters, however, are rushed. As the Second World War passes, viewers get to see where each of the characters are and what they are doing. Perhaps the chaotic ending was intended, since everything that happened during that war was chaotic. Very few questions are left when the screen reads \u201cFin,\u201d and most of those are philosophical.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the characters section, this show is also a romance. The relationship between Kujou and Victorique is very important throughout the entire show. The conflict between science and magic still takes priority over it, but the conflict of the romance plot is directly related to the other. Although they are not the same, the events that occur affect both plots. When the main conflict is resolved, so is the romantic one (albeit a romantic sub plot remains unresolved until the very end).\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways I want to give the story a 10, but I will not for one reason. The show that gets a 10 in this field must be, without a doubt, the best story I have encountered. While I haven\u2019t seen such an interesting storyline executed in such decent way, I cannot say it is the best. That being said, I cannot say that about anything else I have seen. I\u2019m picky that way. So go ahead and put a 10 in that spot, since it would have one if I wasn\u2019t stubborn.\\n\\n\r\nArt -10\\n\r\nThe character art in Gosick is basic. It does not distract the viewer by being too flashy or by being of poor quality. The faces of the characters do not have the details they could have, and my art styles surpass the one used in this show for that reason. However, plenty of detail went into the clothing of each character. Not only were Victorique\u2019s dresses given plenty of time and effort, but even the supporting characters had well thought out clothes. Luigi, who appears only a few times, first appears wearing a ratty set of clothes. The detail put into making his simple set of clothes look like he slept in the streets took effort that many shows don\u2019t put in.\\n\\n\r\nThe quintessence of art in Gosick is its back grounds. From the insides of homes and libraries, to greenhouses and full landscapes, the artists of this show worked hard on every detail. The scenery of the city near Kujou\u2019s academy is splendid; the cobblestone street and European style homes look realistic. Several landscapes are shown when the characters travel, and they are never reused images. Every time one appears, they look like places worth visiting. \\n\\n\r\nThis is why I gave Gosick a 10 in art. I would want to visit every place the characters travel if they really existed: from the lush green countryside to the snowy Alps (granted I could visit Italy for that). The scenery was never ignored or rushed, and I have seen very few shows that compare in the slightest. As for character design, the show does not lose any points from that. Although it is not the best way to draw characters in my opinion, it fits the rest of art well. Because the art does not take any time to get used to (unless you\u2019ve never seen anime before), with the combination of its simplistic style and mixing well with the background art, the character designs do not distract from the show. As a note, art is one aspect that I\u2019m extremely picky about. Art alone can decide whether or not a complete show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 8\\n\r\nThe in show soundtrack is very good, but it does not change much as the show continues. Nakagawa Koutarou does not ruin the show with her music. In fact, many of the scenes are made much more dramatic due to her works. However, she is no Yuki Kajiura. A show of such high quality seems deserving of an amazing soundtrack, but it is left with an above average one at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and endings of the show are among the best music the show provides. Yoshiki Lisa created an amazing opening for the show. Destin Histoire puts the viewer in the right mood for the show. It is an upbeat song, but it is not so happy that it deceives the viewer (as the show gets dark from time to time). It is not dark enough to scare away people looking for a good story. \\n\\n\r\nKomine Lisa made the first ending, Resuscitated Hope. This song was a perfect ending for each episode. Since the show often ended on a cliff hanger, this song only intensified the suspense. Also, appropriate for a show title in the engrish version of \u201cGothic,\u201d this ending has plenty of Nightwish vibes. Of all the themes for the show, this fit the very best. Unity was the second ending of the show. Also created by Komine Lisa, this song is drastically different from Resuscitated Hope. It is not unfitting for an ending for the show, and it accomplishes everything the first ending did nearly as well. However, this song drops the score dramatically. It is so different from the first ending, that it is a shock to the viewer when it appears. It is not as good as the first, so it seems quite worse than it actually is. This should be unexpected when you go from a Finnish rock style to a folk style suddenly. For those willing to ignore the change, the song becomes attractive over time. However, it is an immediate distraction, and unfortunately is the absolute worst part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI give Gosick a generous 8 in music. I generally don\u2019t pay attention to in show soundtracks, and if I don\u2019t notice it, it deserves about an 8. I noticed this soundtrack from time to time, always in a good way. All of the openings and ends are songs I can listen to over and over again. This show deserves a 10 for its work. I will not give that score, because the music causes what I believe to be the biggest flaw in the show. If the endings had not changed, I would not be as harsh as I have to be.\\n",

            "content": "Review contains possible spoilers.\r\nI find that GOSICK is flawed and weak in every way, and to summon up a commonly used cliche to describe an undesirable mystery,\"it's like watching Scooby-Doo.\"\r\nSo my first comparison will be how Scooby-Doo is, in fact, superior to GOSICK in terms of mystery. Scooby-Doo is an episodic mystery show (similar to GOSICK in this regard) in which a cast of bumbling characters winds up with a mysterious case on their hands, that is always solved (similar to GOSICK). Unlike GOSICK though, Scooby-Doo always introduces it's culprits prior to the solution, and presents CLUES as to HOW the mystery is solved alongthe way. GOSICK has no development in regards to it's mysteries. They are solved *magically* and I mean, without any clues or evidence nearly every time by a \"Fifteen\" YEAR OLD GIRL. She can spot who the cuplrit is by the way he or she holds a gun, for example. She knew that the culprit of murder must be blonde because it was sunny out, for another. Or how about the ever so flattering \"the culprit is black because it was dark out.\" Are you kidding!? So in short, Scooby-Doo is a better mystery because GOSICK is not a mystery. GOSICK is a fantasy anime in which little girls can outwit their older brothers who have detective's licenses.\\n\\n\r\nAs every review has said, Kujo is a garbage character. Even the reviews attempting to explain how wonderful GOSICK is mention that Kujo was a generic protagonist. The story is that he is a highly intelligent Japanese student who is transferred to an imaginary European country. So we have the Japanese highschool student cliche with legs as our lead. How creative. This cliche would have worked if the setting was Japan in the 1920s. I am not willing to embrace this cliche if the setting is supposed to be in Europe though. Just so the teenage Japanese audience could relate to the story, they forcibly needed to add a poorly written Japanese boy as the lead? Kujo is so pointless as a character and shows so little development that I doubt he was necessary to any point of the story except to add a filter for the audience to see through and to stir some \"romantic scenes\" with Victorique.\\n\\n\r\nExcept GOSICK is not a romance. There's twenty-two episodes of light banter between two archetypal characters, and then two episodes of reversal, and we're supposed to believe GOSICK is a romance? Unless you are easily deceived by crying and enormously blatant drama then you might. This kind of finish can be termed as \"wrap up drama,\" in which the story lacks development for eleven episodes or so and then in the final two or so episodes a dramatic plot is concocted to give the show lasting appeal, a technique commonly used in slice of life anime as a way to finish a show. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite (sarcasm incoming) part of said ending though, was when about half way through the series a \"super serious ultra scary dramatic prophecy of great mysteriousness\" was directly told (in a supernatural manner, once again GOSICK would've sat far better as a fantasy) to Kujo by an old dude that he and Victorique would travel far apart and that they would face grave misfortune for the rest of their lives. [[[[SPOILER:]]]] Of course, GOSICK has a happy end. There's no point in introducing this concept of great loss and permanent misfortune if it /does not happen/. Adding in uselessly \"epic\" scenarios and scenes into an anime does not actually make it an epic.\\n\\n\r\nNow a lot of reviews criticize Kujo, but not Victorique. Victorique is a by the book tsundere character. That's about the level of depth she has other than (once again, unrealistically) her incredibly mature voice. The show actually tried to explain her mannerisms in one episode by delving into her \"dark and mysterious and emotional and begrudged\" past. Oh my goodness, laugh out loud for real. Oh sure, a little girl can change the tone and pitch of her voice as well as the way she acts by being locked in a prison... her whole life. Is that scientific? No. Is that possible? Well without any facts, statistics, charts, studies, or maybe even imaginary facts, statistics, charts, and studies I would have to say, no! There is no logic behind her behavior other than \"uh well she was alone for a while and then she completely changed forever.\" Reasonable logic, I think not. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond that her character is loved by many for doing pointlessly childish things and puffing out her cheeks much like every tsundere. And she isn't even voiced by Rie, so like, what the point is, I don't know. She's just another piece of bait to attract fans.\\n\\n\r\nWhat GOSICK really attracts people with is though, is it's Victorian setting (well, and having a small blonde girl as it's cover piece). A few anime share a similar setting in a similar time period - Chrno Crusade, Victorian Romance Emma, and Kuroshitsuji to name a few. The mysteries in this series are so convoluted that this setting isn't even necessary. It's definitely not needed for the mystery, because there is nothing Victorique can't solve, essentially making her solutions as inconceivable as having a futuristic computer solve the mysteries. It also isn't needed for the \"romance\" because it could have been set in any wartime period (or more exact inter-wartime period, or post-wartime period, or whenever more exactly). So what's it needed for? It's needed for an audience is what I draw from this. It's needed so it can be slightly different, but exactly the same. Anime has only scratched the surface of the Victorian setting, and people are highly interested in such a time, so it draws in viewers. I'm not trying to be a cynic here and tell you that it did all this to draw in fanbase but... I actually think that's why GOSICK has the Victorian setting as it's time period because I logically can't think of any other reason.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you're still reading, I must thank you, because I'm about to get into the muckiest part of this piece - the side characters. To begin unfurling this mess, I have to bring out the ditzy teacher. She does nothing except comic relief and drool over the other comic relief guy (whose hair is a drill, ha ha). The second comic relief character, Grevil, Victorique's older brother earlier in the series is portrayed in every episode as an ignoramus. Yet he's the detective and his little sister solves all his mysteries. (What a fantastical fantasy anime this is!) Then in the final arc, much like the two main characters, instead of getting development throughout this 24 episode series, his character suddenly goes grim and serious. This is not character development. This is a re-write. There is no character development in GOSICK, there is only a re-writing of the whole cast in the last few episodes, that is just too unbelievable even for my willing suspension of disbelief to hold. Another character is Avril, a classic dope supplying comic relief (but like the aforementioned two isn't funny either). So the recurring cast are all dopes with the exception of supercomputer Victorique. Single arc characters are the tritest of the bunch though. The antagonists have their flimsy motive or mysterious prophecy (most arcs tend to center more around supernatural beliefs and occurances, despite the mystery tag) and all the side characters are one-dimension at best. Victorique's mom and the Roscoe twins are actually hilarious though, because they create such a crudely dramatic and painfully bad allusion to Alice in Wonderland. I didn't even know that the whole cast was essentially a poor parody until the ending when Kujo was holding a book with a white rabbit and little girl together. So apparently, their obnoxious roles as characters was to simply imply a better work! How classic! GOSICK wishes it could be Heart no kuni no Alice, which is already a fangirl's rendition and (somewhat of an enjoyable butcher) of the original Lewis Caroll staple, forget Alice in Wonderland itself!\\n\\n\r\nTouching on music is almost always subjective in a way, but I just wasn't impressed. There were no tracks that caught my interest, the openings weren't particularly enjoyable, nor were the endings. The voicing as I mentioned earlier felt unbelievable, too, because Victorique has the voice of a forty-year-old woman. So I can't really complain about the sound beyond how average I found it to be. \\n\\n\r\nI'll end with the art and animation. BONES I've seen better from you. The background art was actually pretty nice, but was far too often engulfed by the ridiculous character designs. The animation in my opinion, was rather poor by BONES standards and the awkward positions characters managed to wind up in often amazed me, as well as the messy looking faces of the side characters. I did not find any character enjoyable to look at, and I feel that Bones just had way too much fun with the bold line tool. Also Victorique has a mishapen and malformed Uguu~ face. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I didn't like GOSICK. It was a waste of time to anyone who pays attention to detail and/or wants a mystery anime. And yes, I can say that going into GOSICK I expected a mystery and in every way I was let down. Because this is not a mystery anime, it is a fantasy anime, and I am quite upset that the database won't let me fix this misnomer.",

            "content": "This is a really great anime if you go in with the right mindset and expectations.\r\nStory: 8/10 The story was very good and enjoyable.  The storyline can be divided into micro-scale and macro-scale subplots. On the micro-scale we have Victorique and Kujo\u2019s  adventures/mysteries. These are initially little, stand-alone mysteries that revolve around the legends of the academy where they study. As the series progresses the mysteries become interlinked with more important and far-reaching issues. I think the mini-mysteries were the weakest part of the storyline, as they were waaay too easy for both victorique and the viewer to solve. Fortunately the dud mysteriesdon\u2019t destroy the series and it picks up. I enjoyed their attempt at a \u2018historical\u2019 macro-scale plot. They rewrite/rearrange a good portion of history but they do reference actual historical events. As the series progresses we see the eerie rise of powerful, unstoppable forces and how the characters get swept up by some of these events. I\u2019ll just stress that this is NOT a Death Note style deductive reasoning game of cat and mouse. There are big and small mysteries that are developed throughout the 24 episodes but the main focus is on the character relationships. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. I thought the landscapes were very beautiful and the characters drawn perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: No problems\u2026can\u2019t say much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10. The anime is very character-driven and many of the smaller mysteries are used as plot devices to allow Kujo and Victorique to interact and bond. I liked the chemistry between Kujo and Victorique as partners too. They complemented each other very nicely and made a great team.  I thought Victorique\u2019s character development and balance of brattiness, quirkiness and warmth was a real strength of the series. Interestingly, Victorique\u2019s personality allowed the relationship between her and Kujo to bypass an annoying clich\u00e9 that I see in many other tsundere anime characters. This involves the \u201ccold\u201d character displaying a gesture of affection or warmth at the end of an episode, and then inexplicably acting like it never happened by the beginning of the next episode. This strategy allows the series to drag out that \u201cwarming up\u201d process by the tsundere character at the cost of making the character seem fickle and inconsistent. I thought that Victorique\u2019s odd, demanding and, at times, innocently sadistic personality naturally lent believability to that \u2018two steps forward, one step back\u2019 approach.  The \u201cromance\u201d angle storyline is integral to the plot and arguably the main focus of the series. I would go as far as to say that this is more of a romance/relationship anime than a true detective series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. If you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into this is one of the most enjoyable animes I\u2019ve ever watched. It has enough plot to make it interesting and engaging while not going overboard with the dark/twisted themes. I had just come off of Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom and I was looking for a satisfying and heartwarming anime\u2026which I got with Gosick.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. I think they could have spiced up some of the earlier mysteries, developed the side characters a bit more, and made Victorique struggle a bit more with the detective work but overall it was exactly what I wanted to see when I watched it. Save this anime for a rainy day.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMisc:\\n\r\nLove/Romance: I would say high. It's not a typical high school drama but you definitely feel it.\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: Thankfully none as 15 year old Victorique looks like she's 11 years old.\\n\r\nBlood/Gore: Light. Most of the violence happens in flashbacks or in reconstructions of events. They show blood splatters and a few deaths but that's about it. There's not really any glorified or stylized anime violence.",

The reason being the little girl's dfc was so amazing that as I read each of her words, I imagined my own face brushing up against her chest.\r\nThe adaption from novel to anime from this first episode has only shown me how kakkoi it'll be and that it'll be the most sugoi series of the season, and possibly year. (tl note: kakkoi means cool and sugoi means amazing)\r\nThe little girl, Victorique has some background stuff to her, but it's not really important, what REALLY matter is how bloody cute she is. When you see her yawn,or roll on the floor in boredom, your heart will flatline and you'll cry tears of moe moe ~kyun. She's so adorable the rest of this show doesn't even matter. Detective stuff? I don't know if she thinks she's Conan or Sherlock, but she sure is adorable when she blushes. To add on after watching episode two, there other redeeming features I've noticed Victorique has now. She has an adorable pouting face, and her sarcastic laugh is just amazingly kawaii desu (tl note: kawaii means cute), and the way she's so stoic around corpses makes me want to cuddle with her in a graveyard.\\n\\n\r\nThe guy who accompanies her is some baka beta male who dances for her when she commands (or maybe he's a guy who likes being bossed around by cute little girls like I am). He's a baka gaijan in some country with a lame nick name (Dark Reaper/Springtime Reaper, he's a baka inu so who cares). Anyways, all you need to know is he's totally her manservant. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all I rate Gosick as a 10/10. This anime was so suteki desu ne~",

            "content": "Gosick received a lot of hype before it aired, and many people looked forward to the airing of this \"masterpiece\" novel. Will Studio Bones do it justice?\r\nI would like to mention that I have not read the novel and thus I am only reviewing the anime version.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\n I am a sucker for detective / mystery anime. The first episode, however, did not meet up to my expectations. It introduced the characters all right, and I did enjoy the little mystery they had. However, being a fan of detective anime / stories, such as Detective Conan, I found the case pretty simple and repetitivein many shows.\\n\r\nBut, my views changed by the second episode. One cannot help but admire Victorique's detective skills, and the two part episode (2 and 3) proved to be entertaining. It was also suspensful in a way, since viewers are left with cliff hangers at the end of the second episode.\\n\r\nIt might be far too early to judge the overall story, but I give it a 9/10 at the moment, and we will see how the whole series unfolds, though I have really high expectations at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\n I'm not surprised at the rating I give the artwork. Studio Bones generally produces eye catching art style, and Gosick did do justice in that. The character designs are interesting (though many say that Victorique resembles Shinku from Rozen Maiden. But that was the author's style, not the studio's. Besides, it suits her!) The opening and ending have very beautiful artwork, and the style is somewhat different than what is IN the show, but still captivating. I give it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\n The music accompanying the series is both mysterious and captivating. It actually draws the viewers in, and sets an overall mood for the show. The opening and Ending songs (Opening by Yoshiki*lisa and Ending by Lisa Komine) are very catchy. The intro is amusingly happy and hyper at the beginning, then at the chorus very enjoyable to the ears. I think it was very well done! As for the ending, many fans rave that it is better than the opening. I personally prefer the opening, though the ending is nothing short of masterpiece. I give the sound a 9/10 only because the music in the show is somewhat repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\n It is a bit too early to judge the characters of the show, so I cannot truthfully rate them. First, let us take Victorique, the main female protagonist. What I adore about her is the fact that she is not only a good detective that puts a pipe in her mouth whenever sleuthing (Sherlock Holmes?) but the fact that after those moments she is a girl in the end. Her random antics (barrel roll! I'm so bored!) keep the viewer entertained, and intrigued by her inner personality. And viewers still wonder what sentimental value her \"gold necklace\" has. Was it her mothers? (I somewhat believe she had a relation to the villain in a way?)\\n\r\nNext is Kujou, the main male protagonist. He is quickly introduced, and for some reason is attached to Victorique from the moment he set eyes on her. What I enjoy is his somewhat \"split\" personality (one moment provides the comic relief, another moment he is dead serious). However, the fact that he is the \"third son and tries to surpass his brothers\" is somewhat cliche? I don't know, maybe it's just me, but this is present in other anime too. But, Kujou proves to be a promising character and \"side kick\" to Victorique.\\n\r\nOther minor characters are also appealing in their own way (a hyperactive teacher?) but some somehow have weird character designs (the Detective and his \"drill\" hair).\\n\r\nI give the characters and 8/10 at the moment since no further information is given about them, and we are only on the third episode, aren't we?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\n Gosick happens to be entertaining, and viewers sleuth alongside the characters, wondering what will happen next. Some cannot wait for the next episode to come, while others are patient enough to think about the mystery during the one week period of time. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\n Gosick looks like a very promising anime, and the fact that it is being produced by Studio Bones only makes it more appealing. Detective / mystery genre fans will not only enjoy Victorique's sleuthing with Kujou, but also her \"cute\" personality while not being serious.",

            "content": "1924.\r\nA mere 6 years after WWI, the fictional European country of Saubure is the location of the prestigious Saint Marguerite Academy, where \"The Golden Fairy\" spends her days in chronic boredom eating sweets and reading in the tower library. One student that attends this school, \"The Black Reaper,\" ventures to the very top of this tower library to see this legendary student literally rolling around, and so, an unusual bond forms between the two. \r\nGosick follows the story between Kazuya Kujou and Victorique de Blois, as they either dive headfirst into the various ghost stories or legends that frequent their school and try to unravelthe mysteries surrounding each, or these troubles find them. These mysteries however, are rather mediocre and can be solved by the viewer with a little common sense. Victorique's flawless explanations at the end of these short mysteries (usually 3-4 episodes) really only make others look rather lacking in intelligence, mostly Kujou. However, I do not believe the main appeal of Gosick is the mysteries themselves, but rather the superb character interactions. \\n\\n\r\nMany times, I found myself watching an episode of Gosick to watch more of the very entertaining interactions between Kujou and Victorique rather than learn more about the mysteries they found themselves in. Victorique, who was ever charming and typically tsundere, displayed cute antics with Kujou passively sighing and laughing. They had excellent chemistry with one another. Their friendship deepens quite a bit in the course of the show, and that was what made the ending and overall experience quite enjoyable. There are some particular moments which were heartwarming and quite emotional, after they realize the importance their presence has for the other. Clutching a small necklace in times of desperation, after all, is sometimes all one needs to keep on living, to see another day, for the sake of the other. \\n\\n\r\nTo make a comparison, this is also particularly one of the reasons I enjoyed Spice and Wolf so much, not for the rather confusing economic and business sense, but the interactions between the two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt in Gosick was very well done and detailed. Saubure was rich and colorful, and characters were animated wonderfully. There are many settings to enjoy, such as the tower library, the town itself, theaters and the rich countryside. It's always nice to see the artist giving viewers a pleasurable viewing experience and diversifying things. \\n\\n\r\nThere was a plot weaved in carefully at around the middle of the series, involving a particularly despicable Marquis and his own self centered plans. Though somewhat unnoticeable in the beginning, the final few episodes of Gosick manage to explode this plot  into a hotpot of emotions, ranging from completely despicable to heartfelt. After a great wind has descended on the world and splits nations apart, comes the time when the relationship between Kujou and Victorique becomes most difficult. Even so, they live for the sake of the other. \\n\\n\r\nSound is minimal, but I felt this helped to enhance the atmosphere of Gosick. What little music is present was fitting for the situation, whether on a speeding train or a platform addressing the country itself. The opening is \"Destin Histoire\" by yoshiki lisa, a catchy pop-rock song with quite the nice animation to go with it. The opening utilizes a pleasant and unique water color style of art, giving even more diversity to the already beautiful art style Gosick utilizes. There are two pieces of ending music, \"Resuscitated Hope\" by Komine Lisa and \"Unity\" by the same artist. They were appropriate for the mood that followed the ending of an episode. \\n\\n\r\nI want to especially applaud Victorique's seiyuu, Aoi Yuuki, for an excellent and laudable performance. She gave a great range of voice for her character, from the bored, sarcastic tones of Victorique to her emotional tones especially as the \"wind\" approaches, with particular mention to Victorique's despair. I do believe the end of episode 22 will tug at quite a few people. \\n\\n\r\nGosick is an overall enjoyable anime that tells the story of two very different people as they tackle fables, legends, stories, and their own shortcomings. Gosick should be viewed not with the mysteries themselves as the focal point, but as the story of Kujou's and Victorique's slow friendship that keeps them together, even with the tragic \"wind\" that will inevitably separate the two. Holding hands, the petite Fairy looks over the shoulder of the reliable and forgiving Reaper, as they face the world.",

            "content": "Gosick is a difficult show to review, it is also a rather difficult show to watch if you're expecting a masterful detective story - which is doubtless the preconception many viewers will have prior to beginning this.\r\nGosick is not a particularly strong detective series - the detective work is generally summarized by Victorique in 1 minute out of a 60 minute story arc, and whatever clues she alludes to are invariably invisible to the viewer.  In spite of this Gosick is actually an extremely enjoyable show to watch: the drama works very well and the characters are extremely likeable (ridiculous hairstyles aside).  \r\nThestory begins with Kujo, a foreign student arriving from Japan to study in the Alps who is quickly cast aside as a pariah by his fellow students.  Being completely friendless, he goes to the library to discover the Rapunzel-like Victorique who is only allowed to live within the confines of the library.\\n\r\nAt first Victorique regards Kujo as a means to alleviate her boredom, but as time progresses they sneak away for secret adventures... I shalln't give too much away, but the relationship which develops between the pair is particularly charming.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention should be given to the artwork of Gosick.  Throughout the series scenes are populated with richly detail backgrounds and finely animated characters - it's a pleasant and rare luxury not to see any cut corners with the animation.\\n\\n\r\nIn short then, the strong aspects outlined above more than make up for the shortcomings of the detective story.  I wouldn't say this is essential viewing by any means, but it is nevertheless an enjoyable diversion.",

I never felt connected to a character like I do in other anime. It's just like watching some stranger's life and not caring whether they die.\r\nWhen I watched a few episodes of the anime, I realised that this anime is a horrible mystery anime. Terribly fails at depicting mysterious situations. Before the case even started, I could easily tell who the culprit was and the story behind it and I'm sure anyone can. It'sa WASTE OF TIME if you're a mystery fan and watching this for mystery.\\n\\n\r\nWell, at least it has a story that follows something. But the character's BG stories are just as if a drunk person made them up. It's like they just needed to make some characters, made them, and gave them a background story to justify what crazy things their doing.  I just didn't get the whole point of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe police. They're lame. I get it that they're trying to depict an ignorant bunch of officers but their stupidity is over the top. They get beaten by some 15 year old kid. Heh.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has decent ED music. The second ED was the best and depicted what was going on in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor mystery fans, it's a big disappointment, for romance fans, it takes too long to get to the romance part. \\n\\n\r\nWhy did I contunue watching this? To tell people not to watch it, of course.\\n\r\nWell, the only thing I liked about this is that it tells about the sadness of war and romance between the irritating two main characters. Which had a pretty nice ending. Also, it showed a few things about how people were during that time. And they showed \"the Turk\" yey!\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime COULD be better. But unfortunately, it isn't good. Lot of people might say that 3 is too bad for it, but the more I think about how irritating it was, the lesser score I give.",

            "content": "~I shall now reconstruct the fragments of chaos...~\r\nA mystery-based anime set in old times? Sounds bland.\r\nThink again.\r\nGosick is a genuinely interesting, entangled web of thought provoking mystery and emotion. Starting out quite slow with a cliche \"mysterious girl meets guy\" scenario, i didn't expect to experience great amounts of character attachment. Like many, i came with the assumption that the show would develop into a dramatic crime-busting series, and not much else.\r\nIf you hadn't already gathered from my tone, i was obviously wrong in my preconceptions of the show, and here's why...\r\nThe mystery genre is often associated with a slow rate of progression, plot-heavy content,and a mind boggling level of complexity that outpaces even the viewer. Although i would definitely not imply that Gosick is easy to follow; it always retains a curious atmosphere - and seems to keep me engaged with not only the story, but the state of the characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nSome of my judgments can't be re-enforced by the first few episodes, as there's an amount of slow building to begin with - preliminary events that follow a slightly formulaic approach, but are necessary for the foreshadowing of much more significant happenings. By no means are these examples of filler though, as it becomes apparent quite soon that Gosick is a show that derives a lot of strength from its detail. \\n\\n\r\nMany times throughout, i found myself internally saying \"oooohhhhhhh...\", as it gave relevance to the most obscure of references: \"fragments of chaos\" in Gosick's case. The manipulation of the viewers' viewpoint when it comes to conveying the mystery aspect of the show never ceased to catch me off-guard. Each time, it brought about wholesome conclusions that actually added something new to the bigger picture, and were even meaningfully referred back to later.\\n\r\n- and so if you can appreciate plot twists, take a note. \\n\\n\r\nGosick is confident in its ability to make fluent sense of the countless small details that link everything together seamlessly - and therefore i would say that the story line is masterfully assembled. I obviously won't reveal too much, but as time goes on, Gosick develops from a deceivingly simple mystery concept, into a radically more intense, passionately fought battle of human corruption. Its emotional sway (having more of a \"part\" later) is effective due to the character development...\\n\\n\r\nWe haven't covered the development yet? \\n\r\nRight...\\n\r\nWell simply put, the protagonist of the story is a relatively generic, but passionate lad - Kazuya. For the most part, he serves as the relatable voice of reason, and the viewers. Victorique on the other hand, is much more unique. She's 2-faced for sure, able to flick between states of anger, happiness, and all-consuming boredom funnily enough. The comedic twists to the characters in the form of particularly relatable personalities allows for good establishment of the shows contrast between themes - and this bares relevance to the contrast of genres.\\n\\n\r\nWhat contrast you ask?\\n\r\nWell if you hadn't already checked the tags, romance becomes another major theme of the show as it develops. It's particularly interesting the way this romance progresses, as the characters' developing understanding of each other, and awareness of the very prominent \"us versus the world\" idea allows of this manifestation of deeper feelings to shape their decisions. Although with a frustrating distance to begin with, as the duo open up to each other throughout, so does the plot line - beyond description.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the presentation throughout is definitely on-par with the wonderful development and detail of both the context and characters. I found the soundtrack in particular to be one of the best I've ever heard!\\n\\n\r\nMake of it what you must... If you're looking for more than just a mystery - something perplexing and clever with a more personal aura, you've got it!\\n\\n\r\nI've tried to leave this quite open-ended, as to invoke a sense of curiosity - the second part of the show definitely outdoes the first.",

            "content": "My Wellspring of Wisdom is telling me to review Gosick!\r\nWell here I am, I'm the master of the universe.\r\nFrom the makers of Sword of the Stranger, FMA: Brotherhood, and Darker than Black sequel. Studio Bones!\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nGosick is your natural detective tale, love story, slice of life.  It is brimming with mystery, set in a fictional European countryside called Saubure (Sauville), adjacent to France and Italy. Its plot follows in the footsteps of Lupin, Detective Conan, Heaven's Memo Pad, hell even Death Note. Our protagonist and deuteragonist is Kujo and Victorique De Blois, respectively. Their mutual friendship eventually blossoms into a partnership. \r\nArt: 7/10\r\nFor 2011,the Art is above average. That isn't saying much, however the cinematography and the detailed description of the European countryside is spot on. The producers and Bones really did their homework, and parleyed a few vacation trips in order to capture the essence, It isn't uncommon for Mangakas and Animators to visit real life locations to maximize surrealism and breaking the 4th wall.  Ryohgo Narita the creator of a very popular series, Baccano! did the same thing by visiting the Chicago Train Station.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first marathoned and binged on the show, the first alluring thing that  \\n\r\nattracted me was not only Victorique's sharp wit, and seething bluntness. But the unmistakable OST, that is eerily similar to Code Geass. Doing some homework, I came to realize that the soundtrack was composed by Kotaro Nakagawa, the very same composer of Code Geass's OST. This is one aspect of Gosick that very much excels in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Kujo is a dunce. An overbearing third son who can never ever match his older brothers. The Fredo Corleone of the family, the black sheep, a weakling, an outcast. A freaking pariah! However he seems to connect with our deuteragonist Victorique de Blois, also an exiled child who had never been embraced in the warmth of love. Her disdain for the world and her cynical pessimistic outlook on life attributes to this fact. She trusts no one with good reason, she was raised in the dungeon cellar of her father's Mansion, due to the fact that her mother was illegitimate, and a criminal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 8/10, I'd recommend this to everyone and anyone. It is very subtle, dark, humorous at times. The tropes are common and have been done before , Gosick revamps them and takes it to another level. Victorique reminds me of Taiga from Toradora, both short and sweet with take no prisoners attitude, and a vicious mean streak. Both will wreathe vengeance on whomever crosses their path. They both also have a calloused stone heart that will open to a lucky boy in time.They are two tsunderes that I hold very close to my weaboo heart.",

What's impressive so far is that Victorique literally seems to be finding the answers out of nowhere  thanks to some kinda fountain of wisdom  and with the very few hints she givesto the main character you can reconstruct how she found out those things. Though some are a bit predictable she's still ahead of me as a viewer even though she doesn't witness what we do so yeah overall godlike character who on top of that is extremely cute WITHOUT any of those fucking clich\u00e9s\\n\r\nshe's not too much of a tsundere  and she's not plain dere either  which is good considering what we've been fed with this year . \\n\r\nAlso the art is amazing I literally fell in love with it , the OP is particularly great since it looks like you're seeing the drawings on paper and they start moving and not just an ''animation'' . Mentioning the animation that is on top of that rather good so far.\\n\r\nThe sound isn't astonishingly good but it's still really pleasant the OSTs are well chosen and fits each scenes \\n\r\nThere really isn't any character I hate at all , even the inspector who's completely obnoxious but has one kick-ass hairstyle ... I don't believe anyone will be able to pull it off  good luck cosplayers !\\n\\n\r\nSo , to finish I'll say gosick is a really enjoyable anime and I'm impatiently waiting to see how it's going to end , if it keeps getting better it'll probably reach my top 10 animes of all time.\\n",

Everything is fine until the spotlight is shown on the \"unfunny comedy pair\" of Kujou and Victorique.\r\nKujou is walking a thin line between being a pansy shounen lead / punching bag for the shoujolead and being somewhat capable.  Emphasis on \"somewhat.\"  He the Watson to Victorique's Sherlock.

            "content": "Overview:\r\nSome anime you actually CAN judge by their cover. Fairy Tail is a generic Shonen Jump title, while Sekirei is an echii harem comedy series. Gosick is not one of these cases. Gosick is a mystery anime set in the 1920s that seems to star a little girl dressed in a Victorian Era maid outfit. Most people would look at the cover and say, \"I'm not the damn Subway guy! Why the HELL would I ever want to watch this shit!?\" I was originally one of those people, but I kept getting recommendations to watch it and finally I caved. Surprisingly...Gosick is actually pretty damngood!\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nThe title \"Gosick\" is actually a misspelling of the English word \"Gothic\" and the series supposedly gets its title from being inspired by Victorian Gothic fiction. It does indeed borrow heavily from a famous  work of Victorian Gothic fiction: Sherlock Holmes. The main character is a detective named Victorika, who mostly spends her time cooped up in her rooftop apartment complaining of boredom. She solves mysteries far more to alleviate the boredom than from any actual concern for other human beings and displays many sociopath traits. She is completely unfazed by murder and is extremely withdrawn, cold, and calculating. However, she possesses a high genius level intellect and an astounding capacity for deductive/inductive reasoning and reconstructing crime scenes. Her only friend is an extremely loyal companion that comes from a military background and serves as the normal individual that can actually interact with other people. Victorika also suffers from an extreme addiction to a white, powdery stimulant...sugar. You thought I was going to say cocaine didn't you? Although later sub-plots develop involving Victorika's family, the basic premise and characters are directly lifted from Sherlock Holmes. The far more famous mystery anime Detective Conan (Case Closed in the United States) also claims to take inspiration from Sherlock Holmes, but honestly Gosick is MUCH closer to capturing the tone and feel of the original. Detective Conan involves a lot of goofy comedy scenes involving Conan's kindergarten friends that would NOT fit into Gothic Genre novel! Gosick actually keeps its dark tone quite consistently with only Victorika's deadpan sarcasm and endless insults providing comic relief. This relates to the other main reason why Gosick is the more faithful adaptation. Sherlock Holmes was a total dick in the original novels! Shinichi Kudo from Detective Conan is simply far too nice and caring to be an accurate, modern day adaptation of the classic character. Now I should address an important question. If you haven't seen Detective Conan and have never read any Sherlock Homes, why would you want to see Gosick? The mysteries in Gosick are actually quite fun and the overall plot is fast paced and keeps things interesting. The character interactions are hilarious and you want to keep watching to see how your favorite characters will all end up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\"I'm NOT a psychopath...I'm actually a high functioning sociopath. Do your research!\" - Sherlock Holmes\\n\\n\r\nI've mentioned already that Victorika is a modern Sherlock Holmes adaptation and actually one of the more amusing ones I've seen in recent memory along with Dr. House and BBC Sherlock! However, where does she fit as an anime archetype? People often classify her as a \"Tsundere\" type character, but that archetype actually has a wide range. Most Tsunderes tend to frequently yell shrilly, boast loudly, slap around the male protagonist, and in general annoy the crap out of me for every second they are onscreen. Examples of this include: Asuka Soryu, Naru Narusegawa, Haruhi Suzumiya, and even Revi from Black Lagoon. The other side of the Tsundere spectrum is the cold and withdrawn extremely\"INTJ\" type who just seem mildly annoyed at all times, is known for deadpan, biting insults and although extremely intelligent is just kind of a dick. This is almost exclusively reserved in anime for male characters like Paul von Oberstein from LOTGH. However, that is exactly where Victorika falls on the spectrum and this makes her a rather unusual character for an anime. Especially considering she is the main character and not just a minor side character. The other main character is the Watson character named Kazuya Kujo. He is extremely nice, caring, relatable, but isn't afraid to stand up to Victorika when he needs to. He is NOT a complete beta male and in only the 3rd episode is using brass knuckles to save Victorica's ass from an assassin and beating the shit out of him. Kujo's military family background gives him a strong sense of discipline and honor. He wishes to prove himself to his elder siblings and to his father, who has always overlooked him. There are other highly amusing characters as well including Victorika's idiotic half-brother, who takes credit for her work despite being an incredibly inept detective. Overall, these are fun characters that I really enjoyed!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI don't feel like going too in depth with the art and sound this time. Neither are particularly amazing, but also not bad by any means. Basically they are pretty average relative to 2011 when this was made. If you like mystery anime with fun characters, this is the anime for you! If you like Victorian Era Gothic fiction and in particular you love Sherlock Holmes, then this is the anime for you! I went in to this anime with virtually no expectations and I came out pleasantly surprised. I award Gosick a very solid 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "I rarely ever find myself liking a series or movie about detectives and strange mysteries because I find that they become extremely repetitive, always following the same formula over and over again where your protagonist(s) uses the evidence at a crime scene to solve a crime. What sets Gosick apart from these aformentioned shows is that it isn't entirely focused on the mysteries and detective work but also places a lot of emphasis on the relationship between the main characters, adding a sort of slice-of-life-ish and romantic side to a story which would have otherwise been a more generic detective show.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story takes placemainly in 1924 and begins with Kujo Kazuya, a Japanese transfer student, attending a European school in the fictional nation of Sauville, situated in between France and Italy. Being racially different and unfortunately associated with a scary character from a local folk tale by his classmates, he becomes somewhat of a social outcast who meets the small and adorable, but short-tempered and anti social Victorique who is actually a genius detective spending most of her time in the botanical gardens at the top of the school library. And thus begins their adventures together, unraveling the strange mysteries and crimes which occur throughout the small European nation of Sauville and forging a an ever-growing relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThere is actually very little I can fault the story with. Most of the cases the due takes on span a few episodes at most, creating what may seem like small story arcs. However, in most of the cases, there are some small clues or facts that will carry on into other cases. From prior experience in other anime, this always creates some confusions and incoherencies, but Gosick executed this almost perfectly, creating an extremely interesting and intriguing story. It also goes without saying that this should not be an anime where you can completely shut your brain off while watching it. By the end, there is, at most, one or two questions which I still had regarding the story, but they were essentially very minor in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real flaw I saw in the story is, while it not may matter to other people, the pacing. I honestly felt like some of the cases Victorique took on we're finished way too quickly, especially when some facts and clues conveniently popped up at the time she needed them. This is particularly evident when she takes on the greatest mystery in the history of Sauville, which she unravels with extreme ease. Despite this, she always tackles the cases in a realistic and understandable manner, always providing concise and reasonable explanations as to how the cases played out, this being one of Gosick's strong points.\\n\\n\r\nReturning from my slight tangent, the pacing makes everything a little difficult to take in, especially in the latter half in the series. Information is constantly thrown at you and I had to replay quite a few scenes to really grasp everything that was happening. Due to the somewhat quick pacing, I felt as though there were some missing scenes which should've been there for the sake of progressing the story along more smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story excelled greatly in Victorique's everyday life of being bored, constantly bossing Kujo around, being cute, and solving mysteries/crimes and I could've watched this anime forever should it have stayed like that because it was just really that much fu to watch. At a certain point in the anime, Gosick begins to transition from an episodic/multi-episodic structure into a more singular story line whereby Victorique uncovers some dark truths which cause large scale events to unfold and place her at the centre of it. This part of the story had potential and could've made for an epic conclusion to the anime, especially considering the build up leading to it (like I have said before, Gosick really does a good job of taking elements from one arc and  exploring them in another), but it ultimately fizzles out because of pacing issues which also led to a few unexplained plot points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are Kujo and Victorique. Aside from his growing feelings for Victorique, Kujo is hardly developed at all. He grows slightly in confidence, detective intelligence, and in physical strength, and you learn small facts about his family and home, but that is about all. He remains mainly as a \"companion\" character to Victorique because almost all of his actions are for Victorique, something which I feel a main character shouldn't really be, especially when the anime primarily focuses on him and not the star of the show, Victorique.\\n\\n\r\nVictorique is the only character in Gosick who receives any sort of extremely meaningful character development and her alone makes this show worth watching. Through Kujo and Victorique's endeavours, you learn about her twisted past and her reasons for being as anti-social as she is. Not only that, she develops from a fragile and scared girl into a much more confident and strong woman, and this is one of Gosick's strengths, alongside being one of the better developed characters that I've seen in all the anime I have watched.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is as a supporting cast should be. They don't receive any development and they aren't interesting enough for us to want them to receive any development. They are there for comic relief, to relay information between the two main characters Kujo and Victorique, or to create conflict between or around Kujo and Victorique. However, there is Avril, one pathetic excuse of a romantic rival to Victorique. She's actually a really likeable character, being lively and extremely out going, almost the complete opposite to Victorique. Aside from being a catalyst for Victorique's developing feelings for Kujo through occasionally making Victorique feel a little jealous of her, she has no role. This is simply because the story makes it so plainly obvious that Kujo and Victorique will always be together and removing her existence from the story would essentially change nothing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is great. Quality listen. The first closing is absolutely legendary, probably the only closing that I've watched as much as the opening. So you can probably tell that when it was replaced with the second closing that I was extremely sad and disappointed, especially since I'm not a fan of that type of music. Simply put, I disliked the second closing.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was great as well, constantly emphasising the atmosphere and helping me immerse myself in the mysterious world of Gosick.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely brilliant. The detail which is put into the 1920's clothing, interior design, city layout, and architecture was astonishing and really helped immerse me into the historical setting. Other features of the world of Gosick like the countryside and forests were also extremely detailed and beautiful. I also want to say that the art style used in the opening is a really nice touch, being unique and different to the art in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation didn't shine as much as the art did but there were times when it did such as in a fight scene or two or when a fire started to grow out of control.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are very few detective movies or series which I have loved as much as Gosick. I was completely engrossed in the intricate story, and fell in love with Victorique from the moment I first laid eyes on her and all throughout the story as she was superbly developed as a character. This is more than just a detective and mystery anime, as I have said before, adding small elements of other genres and therefore creating a more complete anime which I will probably treasure for a long time to come. Subjectively, the only flaw I saw in this anime was the pacing of the story and the somewhat anticlimactic ending. If you haven't gotten a hold of the fact that I strongly recommend this anime, then I'll quickly say it; I strongly recommend this anime to just about everyone since, while being a primarily detective/mystery anime, it contains enough elements from other genres for many people to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading! Any feedback is very much appreciated!",

            "content": "To the rhetorical question: \"Why would I watch a mystery anime with mediocre mysteries?\", I provide the following four rebuttals.\r\n     1. \"I don't mind mediocre mysteries.\"\r\n     2. Heartwarming character interactions and development\r\n     3. Awesome loli detective with puffy cheeks.\r\n     4. Beautiful Victorian setting and clothing.\r\nGosick is a so-called mystery anime set in aftermath of World War I in the fictitious country of Sauville. The anime follows the exploits of Victorique and her servant/friend/partner, Kujo, as they unravel the mysteries surrounding Victorique's origin and the impending world conflict. However, despitebeing a mystery anime, the mysteries in this anime are not its main appeal. To understand the flaws in these mysteries, consider the mystery manga/anime Detective Conan. Detective Conan takes tender love and care to lay out clues, evidence and suspects so that it is easy for the reader to follow the detective's train of thought. However, to this date, I have yet to completely 100% solve a mystery in Conan before the main detectives; the mysteries manage to maintain their complexity despite being thoroughly scrutinized up into the point that they are solved. In high contrast, it's impossible to follow Victorique's game-breakingly fast train of thought and yet your hunches about the mystery always end up as correct. In conclusion, the mysteries written into Gosick are shallow and yet predictable, and there is really nothing impressive about Victorique's ability to solve them.\\n\\n\r\nSo then, how would a mystery anime with middle-rate mysteries maintain the interest of its viewers. Quite simply, the individual mysteries are mere pieces of a larger whole. If one considers the anime as using mysteries an unconventional method to reveal plot points rather than as a series of individual cases in which our heroes tackle one by one, the mystery on the grand scale becomes immensely complex. Suddenly the story is riddled with twists and foreshadowing as thick as a jungle and just as convoluted. Each smaller mystery becomes part of a larger story, a tale surrounding a lonely girl and the circumstances in which she came to this world. Roughly a half way through the anime, the scale of the anime blows up exponentially, involving things like conspiracy in the royalty and under-the-table political dealings. Despite the growing number of threads in this story, in the end they all manage to wind themselves down and point towards a specific event, the outbreak of which clearly defines the last two episodes. Indeed the events of the anime can be thought of as the fuse to a small bomb places at the last two episodes which blows up quite literally into the climax of the story. After that explosive event blows away all previous setting and development, the story decides to wrap itself up in a heartwarming bundle. All in all, a good tale.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story maybe good, it is the characters that stand out in this anime. The relationship between Kujo and Victorique is a complicated one to say the least. Most of the time, Kujo dotes on Victorique like a father dotes on his spoiled daughter, he constantly brings her candy and sweets, and often carries her around when not carrying her luggage. In return Victorique abuses Kujo physically and verbally while demanding more sweets or else rolling around on the floor like a spoiled brat. Kujo tolerates all this, but once Victorique steps out of line in front of other, he thoroughly chastises her like the typical Asian parent. You may notice that I make a lot of father-daughter comparisons when describing their relationship. Well there is nothing incestual between; the point is that they care very deeply for each other. Their relationship is far beyond mere platonic friends and yet they aren't quite in the romantic area yet, the way they see each other is most aptly described as beloved family. It is this special bond between them that allows them to cross fate, time, and space in order to see each other one more time. The supporting cast is quite large, and they have their fair share of heartwarming moments for being supporting cast. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the production quality of Gosick is quite solid. The setting of a early 20th century Victorian European country is drawn beautifully, with fantastic architecture on the buildings, gorgeous frilly dresses on the women, and awesome suits with those scarf-necktie things on the men. The animation is quite good although at times the quality sometimes drops, especially and most unfortunately during action scenes. The sound is pretty decent, BGM and OP and ED all are listenable but not too memorable. Special props go to Yuuki Aoi, the seiyuu of Victorique, for doing an awesome job voicing a cool, smart, yet spoiled and bratty loli detective. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if any of items 1-4 in the introduction appeal to you, it won't hurt for you to give this anime a shot.\\n\\n\r\nQuestions, comments, criticisms, and compliments are welcomed whether you found this review helpful or not. \\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nTo me, Gosick (a play on the word \"Gothic\") is the token example of an anime that seems mediocre and flawed at first, only for it throw the viewer a complete curveball and significantly pick up during the second half until it turns into something truly unique and enjoyable. I thought I had this show pegged at around the halfway point, but once it started to go in a more over-aching direction rather than an episodic one, the tone of the show did a 180 degree turn. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nSynopsis: Set during 1924 in Saubure, a small (and fictional) European country in the Alps,Gosick follows a Japanese boy named Kazuya Kujo who has been sent to study abroad at the prestigious Saint Marguerite Academy. He has a lot of trouble fitting in due to his black eyes and hair, which bear resemblance to \"The Reaper who comes in the Spring\"; a figure from a ghost story that all of the students at the academy actually believe, making them fear Kujo. However, he soon discovers that he is not the only one at the academy to be labeled a monster when he meets a small golden haired girl named Victorique, who the students refer to as \"The Golden Fairy of the Library\" (from the story \"The Golden Fairy of the High Tower\"). Supposedly intelligent enough to not even need to attend classes, Victorique turns out to be the only thing that keeps the area's police force operating as she is the one who is called upon whenever an unsolvable mystery arises and, of course, solves it. Despite her indifference to him, Kujo repeatedly returns to the library to visit Victorique until they become close friends and work together to solve whatever mysteries/problems they are presented with, namely Victorique's dark and complicated past.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Gosick is often described as a mystery/detective show, I would strongly disagree with that characterization.  In fact, the mysteries and \"detective work\"  were one of the weaker points of the show in my opinion. Gosick is more of a historical-fiction drama a subtle, overarching plot that finally comes together at the end of the anime and ends up being the saving grace of the pseudo-episodic plot. So if you are looking for a good mystery anime about detectives, you won't find it here. However, if you are looking for a good historical  drama with romantic elements and strong influence from the mystery genre, you will likely enjoy Gosick.\\n\\n\r\n As previously mentioned, Gosick first opens with an episodic style of story telling; one mystery after another is presented to Kujo and Victorique, they investigate, and Victorique solves the mystery with her deus ex machina-like \"power\" which she refers to as \"the wellspring of wisdom\". These mysteries are all mildly amusing, but mediocre due to shoddiness and lack of emphasis put in the investigative parts of the mysteries that make it so the viewer can't possibly solve the mystery before Victorique explains what happened. In case you couldn't infer this, the episodic mysteries are not Gosick's strength.\\n\\n\r\nAs these smaller mysteries are going on, there is a much, MUCH bigger mystery that slowly gets unraveled as the show progresses involving Victorique's past, her family, government conspiracies, an alchemist, magicians, and a whole lot more.  THIS, my friends, is the reason you should watch Gosick. The over-aching plotline of the anime takes quite a bit of time to develop, but it creates a lot of suspense and intrigue in an otherwise uneventful show and then manages to completely exceed the expectations you may have had for its resolution. Gosick's true plot explores mature themes such as dedication to one's family, the ways that love can either mend or destroy your life, alienation, and what causes humans to become emotionally attached to each other. The result is something truly wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nThe romantic aspect of the show, which receives quite a lot of focus, follows the same general model as the main plot does; it starts off as nothing special. Just a bunch of classic tsundere  bullshit that gets very old very fast. However, the romance takes a very serious turn at around the same time the plot does. We are actually presented with legitimate reasons for Victorique being so tsundere and reasons for Kujo putting up with it; the viewer actually feels and understands the emotional attachment that the two have for each other and it really resonated with me by the end of the anime even though I wasn't that into it at first.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I wish they had just dropped the episodic mystery thing all together and focused on the true plot, because that would have made for a much more entertaining and consistent story. Regardless, I very much enjoyed Gosick's plot; it is compelling and unpredictable with an overall well-written romance.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nVery fluent and bright animation that's always pleasant to look at. I'm a big fan of the character designs and atmosphere as well. Just visit Gosick's page on MAL and look at the cover picture; something about the body language of Victorique and the dimly-lit, somber atmosphere is just so engrossing to me. It captures the style of the anime very well. I really like the art style of  this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe in-show tracks are well done as are the endings and the catchy opening; an overall average/above-average soundtrack depending on preference. I'm adding on an extra point because of how much I loved Aoi Yukki as the voice of Victorique; the personality and unique flair that she brings to the role is awesome and provides a different  take on what could have been a stereotypical tsundere character. There is no dub for Gosick, but the sub has very nice voice acting for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThere is a slew of interesting characters throughout Gosick's large cast, including comic relief characters, sinister antagonists, antiheros, and more. There are only two primary leads though, those being Kujo and Victorique. \\n\\n\r\nKujo, the third born son of a high ranking officer of the Japanese Imperial Army, was basically raised to be a man's man. He was constantly scolded for being so \"girly\", and was forced to only like things that a man should like. While you can see the influence of this upbringing in his character, it is also very apparent that his personality is very contrary to those strict rules that were imposed upon him. This is my favorite part about Kujo's character because it goes along with the theme of dealing with alienation/being different, which, while never truly focused on during the show, is one of it's better themes. As a protagonist, Kujo is your typical male counterpart to a tsundere girl on the outside, but a much more deep and complex character on the inside. However, as I've mentioned many times before, the unique and compelling side of him  doesn't come out of him until towards the end of the show (except when they are revealing his backstory). In the end I thought Kujo was a good character; not great, but good. He filled his intended role more than adequately. \\n\\n\r\nThe other major character, Victorique, is an interesting case. I had a very love/hate relationship with her throughout Gosick. At first, I liked her. She was pretty adorable (her sarcastic laugh slayed me when I first heard it XD) and her voice actor did a very good job with her. As the show started to get repetitive, however, so did Victorique's humor. She was on the fast track to becoming yet another annoying tsundere and I was sort of over her. Then, the final act of Gosick kicked in and I loved her more than ever before! She becomes a very strong female lead with a fascinating past, interesting motivations, and much more that I wish I could talk about, but can't. Rarely do you see a female character with such mental strength and intelligence in anime, and that is a breath of fresh air. Overall, Victorique is awesome, but she is still only my 2nd favorite character in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters (including my favorite character) are too numerous for me to talk about and some of them could delve into spoiler territory, so I won't talk about them except to say this: the majority of them kick ass. While I wasn't a big fan of the teacher, the side characters that are centered around the main plot (you know the ones, fans) are just epic as all hell. I'd be shocked if you didn't get attached to at least one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gosick has a very, very nice cast of characters. The ones that need to be developed are developed (very nicely) and the ones that don't need to be developed aren't developed (certain comic relief characters), and that's just the way it should be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend you give Gosick a try, provided you aren't under the assumption that it's a mystery/detective show, which it certainly is not. The pre-WWII setting does this anime a lot of favors and makes for a compelling atmosphere. With an epic plot that is definitely worth the wait for it pick up, an awesome cast of characters, and some above average animation/voice-acting, Gosick has something for just about everyone.\\n",

            "content": "The fragments of chaos are all lined up...\r\nI'll reconstruct them for you here into a review...\r\nI'll take the fragments from the chaos of this world...\r\nAnd I will reconstruct them into truth using the wellspring of wisdom within me...\r\nStory: 10\r\nGosick stars Kazaya Kujo, a Japanese exchange student in the fictional European country of Sauville.  During his stay in Sauville, he meets up with the other main character, Victorique, a small girl with long blonde hair and dresses in lolita clothing, and solve mysteries together.  Throughout the series, as each mystery is solved, more questions on the past, and the family relating to Victorique areraised.  These questions are the driving force for the latter half of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was amazing.  What seemed like pointless arcs in the beginning all tied together seamlessly in the last two episodes.  The last two episodes were filled with so much suspense, so much emotion, the series has one of the best if not the best ending to any mystery genre series. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the mystery genre and the reason why most people stop watching Scooby Doo is that the mysteries are repetitive and boring as they do more and more of.  Sherlock Holmes does a great job of not being repetitive when it deals with mystery because the characters, mainly Watson, are very interesting and keep the mystery solving exciting.  Gosick does the same deal, as the characters allow the mystery to be more interesting rather than a rinse, wash, repeat process.  \\n\\n\r\nThe romance in the anime, was rather slow in the beginning.  I couldn't even see the two characters becoming a couple, but as the series progresses, we got to see a great change in character for both of the main characters.  This will be discussed in more detail in the character section.  \\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the story was executed well.  The story takes place during the 1920s in a land that is transitioning use to electricity.  We see candles, we see lightbulbs.  We see trains and planes, we see carriages pulled by horse.  These contrasting things pull off an effect of a unique setting that very few people give much thought too.  The ending does a great job with the setting, as it pulls up true history and applies it very well to the story.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nGosick scenery wise was fine, nothing too outstanding in the scenery department.  The art stands out more in the character designs and specifically, Victorique.  The dresses that Victorique had were jaw dropping.  They were so pretty and well drawn, each lace, each fluff, everything.  Seeing the first dress was impressive, but seeing the other dresses were just amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nSomething that caught me by surprise were the action scenes.  I was not really expecting those action scenes, but they were executed really well.  The right amount of use for transition scenes that caused a clear understanding of what was actually happening during the action.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OP, Destin Histoire, was a great song that reflects the pacing of the anime.  With a very calm beginning, the series starts off calm, with mysteries that involve others and not the main characters.  The song will pick up much as the mysteries and suspense do in the series.  The first ED, Resuscitated Hope, didn't really fit in with the series, but was still a fine song.  A calm beginning but a bit too hard for what the series had in mind.  The second and last ED, unity, was a great ending and the type of ending I was expecting to have in the first place.  I would suggest them to have used \"unity\" as the sole ED rather than using two different songs...\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was fine, no complaints.  Helped carry the mood of emotion or added suspense when it was needed.  Nothing too outstanding for the background music sadly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAs I have said before, the characters had to be interesting to keep the viewers entertained during the mystery solving.  Victorique and Kujo do a great job at keeping the viewer entertained as their little squabbles, Victorique's attitude of \"I'm better than you\" crumbles to a very cute innocent girl, Kujo's slight stubbornness but I will do it anyway... These characters are very likable and enjoyable to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was amazing, as Victorique was a character who never experienced love and Kujo was a character who needed confidence, these two characters built off each other in a symbiotic relationship that is very endearing to the viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10+\\n\r\nWatching these characters interact with each other during the mystery and outside of the mystery was one of the most enjoyable things about this series.  The suspense this anime can deliver is nothing short of amazing.  This series is addictive and does a great job at keeping the viewers attention.  \\n\\n\r\nThe most enjoyable part was the ending.  I have explained why I found this enjoyable in the story section... but it needs to be explained twice!  That is how enjoyable it was.  The flawless execution of suspense and emotion during the last two episodes were down right amazing.  Nothing could have stopped me or cause my eyes to drift away from the laptop screen during those last two episodes.    \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI was expecting just a cute story... something similar to Hyouka where they solve mysteries and through the mysteries, the two main characters get together.  This anime showed me something I wasn't expecting, true chemistry between the two main characters, a true connection that can be felt outside of solving a mystery.  Gosick has earned a spot in one of my most favorite anime series.  \\n\\n\r\nThat ending was so goooooooooood.\\n",

I can't really say anything more about the story without spoiling something so let's get to the \\n\\n\r\nART 8/10: gosick had some really fine art, actually this is one of the rare elements that I liked in gosick! yay\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 3/10: I'm sorry did anyone notice anything good about this category? I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS/RELATIONSHIPS 2/10: now this is the most important part in an anime (for me at least), I've rarely seen such a horrible cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nVICTORIQUE: no, her name is Victorica, but the japanese people pronounce Victorique-Victorica apparently. I know of their engrish habit but imo they could at least learn the f-ing name of the main character. Victorique isn't pronounced Victorica nor in french nor in german ffs. (nor in any other language that I know btw)\\n\r\nShe is a sweet(not) girl that spends most of her time reading in the botanical garden situated at the top floor of the library tower. Right here we got such an original plot : blonde girl imprisoned at the top level of a tower, waiting for her prince.\\n\r\nNow she is the worst loli tsundere I've ever seen, I just hate everything related to this character! As mentioned before she solves most of the mysteries without using her brain, she apparently has some wellspring of wisdom or whatever inside of her. aka => you won't see any mystery being solved in a logical way (except the first one and some not important side mysteries) most of the times she will appear at the end of the episode saying that she has every piece of the CHAOS and she can put everything together to solve the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nKUJO: ahh the male protagonist, you expect something good at least in the male protagonist. Well I'm sorry I'll destroy your illusions! He is just your typical male character that you'll find in every second anime that you'll watch. He apparently loves SM, why am I saying this? because he just loves to get his ass kicked by Victorica (YES she is called Victorica by the other characters in the anime so I'll call her the same way!). I'm serious, he gets all mad at Victorica at least once/episode because SHE IS a bitch, give him 2-3 minutes and he'll run back to her treating her to some sweets.\\n\\n\r\nnow their RELATIONSHIP: again WTF? in ep 4 or 5 I can't remember exactly they are at some \"fortune teller\" and both of them ask him: how long will they be together?\\n\r\nwhoah whoah whoah, WHAT?! trust me, in the beginning (aprox 10 episodes) they hardly know anything about each other the development in their relationship advances too fast.\\n\r\n\"Ohh cool, so we have some romance?\" who are you kidding? there is absolutely NO romance in this anime. The romance is just somewhat suggested.\\n\r\n I tried as much as I could not to spoil anything in this section while still highlighting the most important parts imo.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the rare parts that I liked in Gosick is actually the story of Victorica's mother! yes, an anime based on her mother would have been a lot better imo.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all this anime is probably the most overrated show that there is on MAL atm imo.\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a good mystery anime turn around and search some more! this is just a waste of time.\\n\r\nI could argument my points a lot better but sadly I would spoil a lot of things by doing so.\\n\r\nAll in all this is the worst mystery/romance anime that I've seen in my life up to this point.",

            "content": "\" Years from now, a gale strong enough to shake the world will blow. Your bodies are light, the gale will surely separate the two of you. However, you hearts will never be apart. \"\r\nGosick is a story of an adventure, romance and mystery of so-called ' Golden-haired princess ' and the ' Reaper that comes in spring '. The princess is a short girl with dark past, short-tempered, like sweets, smart yet unable to express her true feelings. The reaper is the third son of an imperial soldier, a bit reckless, always complain about the princess' actions and yet, is very fond of her.\r\nAta first glance, the story appears to portray the debunk of the mysteries and revealing the truth behind it, connecting the dots to a final big reveal. \\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries, also known as ghost stories because of its authenticity and seems to be impossible to solve or even understand it is overcame by these two unlikely partners, tackling each cases as it comes. Compared to other detectives anime, reconstructing the chaos while biting a blue pipe is what makes the princess special and adorable with all her emotions, sarcastic comments and her unique personality. Moreover, the side characters are well defined, each with their own quirks which makes the story much more interesting. I'd also like to compliment on the theme songs, especially one of the endings, ' Resuscitated Hope ' which strikes right into the feels and managed to cover for the main characters as well as the story. \\n\\n\r\nThese are the surface plot which might interest you but there's more to it. \\n\r\nWhat interested me the most is the lovely and realistic interaction between the princess and the reaper. When he said something that he shouldn't have, she would kick him in the leg mercilessly and he would cry out in pain. When she angered him, he would leave her with stomping foots, only to return regretfully with more sweets later. Whenever they are separated, both can't stop thinking about each other and how their wish to meet again can turn into tears.\\n\\n\r\nThey both long for each other's company and always managed to spend time together, cherishing every moments because they know that deep inside they will be separated eventually, and the only things that will be left behind are a pendant and a ring, the very symbol of love and memory. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for an anime that combines romance, mystery and adventure and a quite complicated detective story with a twist, this is it. Join them both and discover their story and see for yourself, their beautiful journey into the unknown and the promise that bonds them together.\\n\\n\r\nWill they live happily ever after? You'll have to see for it yourself.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Detective stories never go out of fashion, but finding a way to make them interesting is another matter entirely. Some leave things open to interpretation, whilst others rely on convoluted mysteries that are more difficult to follow than a city street map. There are also whole bodies of work dedicated to the exploits of well known sleuths like Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Inspector Morse and more.\r\nSo what was the great innovation brought forth by the anime industry? Why loli detectives of course!\r\nOriginally a light novel series by Sakuraba Kazuki, Gosick (which may be a play on the word \"Gothic\"), is set in thefictional European country of Sauville where Kujo Kazuya, the third son of a high ranking officer in the Japanese Imperial Army, begins attending the prestigious St. Marguerite Academy. He quickly discovers that almost everybody in the country is enamoured with tales of the supernatural, and one of the strangest tells of a golden fairy who lives at the top of a tower ...\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is generally well constructed and the basic premise is actually quite interesting, so it's unfortunate that the narrative is a bit too linear for the majority of the series. In addition to this there are several rather blatant attempts at moving the story forward by inserting some obvious tokens into specific episodes, many of which could have been handled in a far more subtle manner.\\n\\n\r\nA major issue when adapting a written work into a visual form is that it will undoubtedly lose something in the process, and that seems to be the case here. Part of the problem stems from the fact that certain aspects of a given story will lose a degree of mystery once they're converted into an image, and this is even more prevalent in animation. While experienced authors are able to hide certain clues or foreshadowing elements in a body of text, once the story is adapted for anime the differentiation between foreground and background becomes far more pronounced. This has the effect of \"highlighting\" the more important parts of certain scenes, and when taken in conjunction with the linear plot, it makes several of the seemingly impossible to solve mysteries relatively easy to deduce.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there is quite a bit of sleuthing going on, and the variety of cases on offer should tickle the fancy of many a mystery buff.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the series is set in 1920's Europe, Gosick has a very continental look to it that's reflected in the clothing, buildings, and even modes of transportation, and the majority of the background artwork is implemented rather well. There has also been a decent attempt at giving the majority of the characters a vaguely European caste to their features, and this can sometimes contrast nicely with the somewhat stereotypical design used for Kujo. The one oddity is Victorique as everything from her height to her clothing is very different to that of everyone around her, which raises an interesting thought. Gosick is, at heart, a detective drama, and in the spirit of tradition the leading sleuth must have something that visibly sets them apart from everyone else. In this case, it's a loli wearing ruffles, lace, and a charming array of bonnets.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty decent for the most part, and the majority of character movements have been implemented rather well. Unfortunately Bones haven't really pushed the boat out with this anime so there are a few telltale signs of inattention here and there.\\n\\n\r\nGosick features a variety of classically themed background music, and while the majority of the tracks reflect the serious tone of the show, there are a few lighthearted pieces scattered here and there. The opening theme, Destin Histoire by Yoshiki\u2606Lisa, is a J-pop/rock song that seems a bit too action oriented for a series that relies more on utilising the character's brains instead of their brawn. In addition to this the stylised montage that accompanies it drops a few too many hints about events that occur in the story, which is unfortunate as otherwise it's a well made and choreographed piece of work. As for the two ending themes by Komine Lisa, Resuscitated Hope (episodes 1 to 12), is a pop ballad that seems to fit better with the tone of Gosick, both musically and in terms of the visuals used for the end sequence. The second song, Unity, is the one that stands out the most as it's far more melancholy and dramatic than the other two tracks, and the accompanying imagery reflects the darker turn the series takes after the halfway point.\\n\\n\r\nThe acting is pretty decent for the most part, with Yuuki Aoi and Eguchi Takuya performing rather well in the roles of Victorique and Kujo (and it's actually surprising to find a tsundere loli that isn't being played by Kugumiya Rie). The rest of the cast also handle their roles passing well, but like so many other titles out there, the script could have been done better. The dialogue is sometimes childish or stunted, and there's a lack of cohesiveness that appears during several conversations which can make the characters seem ... lacking.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the biggest surprise in Gosick is that there's actually a fair degree of justification for Victorique being not only a loli, but also tsundere. Kujo is the typical \"blank canvas\" used in so many anime to highlight just how much he develops by the end of the series, but in all honesty neither of the leads is anything really special. The fun actually starts when one looks at the supporting characters as there's literally a wealth of personalities and ambitions on display. While there is some growth to be found for both Victorique and Kujo, it's the amount of characterisation that has gone into the minor roles that makes this series interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the show does sometimes play fast and loose with certain events, and there are several occasions where the situation has clearly been contrived to develop a particular character in a certain way.\\n\\n\r\nGosick may have its flaws, but that doesn't mean it's a terrible show. There's a decent amount of detective work in the series that raises it above the likes of Tantei Opera Milky Holmes and Hidan No Aria, and while the mysteries on offer can sometimes be easy to deduce, there are also a few that contains some interesting twists on the stories that they've inspired. That said, this isn't an anime for everyone, mainly because it relies more on the characters using their heads rather than the usual shounen tactic of solving problems by hitting them until they've gone away. In addition to this the element of romance in the story can often feel more like an afterthought, something added to give the characters a bit of added dimension.\\n\\n\r\nSomewhat surprisingly, I found that I enjoyed this anime a lot more than I thought I would. The idea of loli detectives is no more laughable than that of a little old lady, an author of crime fiction, or even a mouse, and once I got over my initial aversion I found a show that was interesting at the very least.  That doesn't mean I'm sold on the idea though, but that's mainly because of shows like Milky Holmes and Hidan No Aria, which really haven't done the concept any favours.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, at least Gosick tries to redress the balance.",

            "content": "Overall - 9\r\nIf you are looking for a good detective series, this is not the show you are looking for. Gosick is not a detective show. It is a historical fiction that tells the story of Ministry of the Occult\u2019s attempt to maintain political power against the rise of science. Victorique, the heroine, solves minor mysteries in a Sherlock Holmes manner throughout the show. As Ridiculous as they may seem at first, the resolutions of these mysteries foreshadow events crucial to the actual plot. Although the conflict is not obvious until the second half of the season, it is present from the first episode.\r\nAnother importantnote to mention is that the show is also a romance. I would put it akin to Toradora. The romantic plot is important to the overarching plot, but it does not take priority over it. If you don\u2019t like romance, you can still like this show. If you want a good love story, you still get that.\\n\\n\r\nGosick gets very dark towards the end, as the overarching plot becomes noticeable. There are scenes filled with action, especially towards the end. Every episode build suspense and questions; as the show comes to a close, it does not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nThe staff of Gosick takes the unimportant details seriously. Minor characters have a lot of personality and perform their roles decently. The background art is among the best of any show I have seen. Every little thing was given time and effort by the staff, and that is one of the best parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love music, this show doesn\u2019t have the world\u2019s greatest soundtrack. However, the music is still very good, especially in the opening and ending themes. As a warning, endings change at episode 13. Being a huge fan of the first ending, the second was a shock, as it is not nearly as good. It is still a very good song, once you\u2019ve hear it a few times. The in show music could be better.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe lead role of the show is a Japanese exchange student Kazuya Kujou. Kujou is an intelligent, albeit na\u00efve, student. He trusts the myths of his host country, Sauville, but does not become entranced by them like the students of that land. In his home country, he is considered a pansy; in many ways he is, but there are times when he has plenty of courage. He is not a toughened warrior at all times, but when other people\u2019s lives are in danger, he steps in the path of bullets. Although Gosick is not narrated, Kujou seems to take that role. Whenever the viewer is left in the dark, so is he. Whenever the view would be confused, so is he. When the show journeys into the supernatural, even Kujou keeps it tied to reality.\\n\\n\r\nVictorique is the character that causes people to label Gosick as a detective series. People present her with cases, sometimes unintentionally, and she solves them within moments. She constantly acts bored and rarely shows any emotions at the beginning. Her history is a mystery that is uncovered bit by bit after each case she solves. The only thing that is obvious in the first few episodes is that Kujou causes Victorique to change. She becomes more social and emotional. Her character changes so much over the course of the show that she looks dramatically different at the end than at the beginning (literally and figuratively \u2013 although the literal change is to emphasize the figurative). The changes make sense with the story, and do not distract the viewer at all.\\n\\n\r\nEach supporting character has a clear cut personality. Even one shot characters have histories explained briefly without distracting from the plot. This is one of the best aspects of the show. The minor characters fulfill their roles well. Grevil de Blois, the only real detective in the series, plays a complex part. He often becomes an obstacle to the main characters, but sometimes he aides them by following or ignoring his superior\u2019s orders. He changes as much as Victorique as the show progresses. Although Grevil is the strongest support, almost none of the others can be done without.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not as picky on grading characters as I am with other sections. I am willing to give 10\u2019s to multiple shows, not just the best. There are requirements to get this score. The cast must be well developed, have purpose in the plot, and fulfill their roles properly. Gosick is one of few shows where I could not find a character I did not like. That being said, there are characters I wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with if they existed. In fact, that is the reason I\u2019d give this show such a good score here. I think that every single one of these characters could exist, because they are developed enough to have realistic personalities.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nThe first half of the Gosick has lots of little mysteries that seem to have little relevance to the entire plot. Also, for someone expecting a detective show, these mysteries are a bit disappointing. Very little work is done in the actual investigative fields, and Victorique solves these mysteries quickly. While many people would find her evidence a bit farfetched, it is fitting for the overall plot of the show. Victorique claims that she puts together the chaos around her using a \u201cwellspring of wisdom.\u201d This is a horrible way to end any mystery arc, if you want a show like Columbo, Monk, or Law and Order. However, this does not hurt Gosick at all. After all, this show is not a detective series; it is a historical fiction. The first few mysteries help develop the characters and foreshadow the important plot points that come later on in the show. Each minor event has relevance to the story, but it does not become noticeable until the second half.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first half, the last episodes are full of minor mysteries. At this point in the show, these mysteries are no longer random. The cases from the first half have gained relevance to the overarching plot. The new mysteries reveal the most important details of the history within the show. Victorique\u2019s past is revealed. The conflict becomes overt. This is an important point in the show; the viewer can see that the conflict has always been present, but no one knows exactly what it is until Kujou discovers it. Also, it proves that the show is not a detective story. Although the heroine is treated as a detective, she does not change the show. The conflict of a detective show is always the same; the leads must discover how an event happened, and who caused it to happen. In the case of Gosick, the conflict present in the overarching plot is completely different: the Ministry of the Occult\u2019s final attempts to maintain political power against the Academy of Science.\\n\\n\r\nThe presence of the supernatural is important for the plot of Gosick. Myths and superstitions help keep the Ministry of the Occult in power. The ignorant populace responds to mystical evidence before the scientific. Victorique offers scientific theories to cases, but she creates them through unlikely means. These theories also make sense when she says them, but they seem mythical as well. This makes Victorique the focal character; she contains elements of the Occult and science in her. She represents both sides equally.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the show feels rushed. The last episode is forced to switch between several characters, locations and times that it is hard to understand what is going on. While it isn\u2019t the smoothest finish ever, it still ends the story well. The conflict between the Occult and science is resolved properly without anything being rushed. The resolutions of all the characters, however, are rushed. As the Second World War passes, viewers get to see where each of the characters are and what they are doing. Perhaps the chaotic ending was intended, since everything that happened during that war was chaotic. Very few questions are left when the screen reads \u201cFin,\u201d and most of those are philosophical.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the characters section, this show is also a romance. The relationship between Kujou and Victorique is very important throughout the entire show. The conflict between science and magic still takes priority over it, but the conflict of the romance plot is directly related to the other. Although they are not the same, the events that occur affect both plots. When the main conflict is resolved, so is the romantic one (albeit a romantic sub plot remains unresolved until the very end).\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways I want to give the story a 10, but I will not for one reason. The show that gets a 10 in this field must be, without a doubt, the best story I have encountered. While I haven\u2019t seen such an interesting storyline executed in such decent way, I cannot say it is the best. That being said, I cannot say that about anything else I have seen. I\u2019m picky that way. So go ahead and put a 10 in that spot, since it would have one if I wasn\u2019t stubborn.\\n\\n\r\nArt -10\\n\r\nThe character art in Gosick is basic. It does not distract the viewer by being too flashy or by being of poor quality. The faces of the characters do not have the details they could have, and my art styles surpass the one used in this show for that reason. However, plenty of detail went into the clothing of each character. Not only were Victorique\u2019s dresses given plenty of time and effort, but even the supporting characters had well thought out clothes. Luigi, who appears only a few times, first appears wearing a ratty set of clothes. The detail put into making his simple set of clothes look like he slept in the streets took effort that many shows don\u2019t put in.\\n\\n\r\nThe quintessence of art in Gosick is its back grounds. From the insides of homes and libraries, to greenhouses and full landscapes, the artists of this show worked hard on every detail. The scenery of the city near Kujou\u2019s academy is splendid; the cobblestone street and European style homes look realistic. Several landscapes are shown when the characters travel, and they are never reused images. Every time one appears, they look like places worth visiting. \\n\\n\r\nThis is why I gave Gosick a 10 in art. I would want to visit every place the characters travel if they really existed: from the lush green countryside to the snowy Alps (granted I could visit Italy for that). The scenery was never ignored or rushed, and I have seen very few shows that compare in the slightest. As for character design, the show does not lose any points from that. Although it is not the best way to draw characters in my opinion, it fits the rest of art well. Because the art does not take any time to get used to (unless you\u2019ve never seen anime before), with the combination of its simplistic style and mixing well with the background art, the character designs do not distract from the show. As a note, art is one aspect that I\u2019m extremely picky about. Art alone can decide whether or not a complete show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 8\\n\r\nThe in show soundtrack is very good, but it does not change much as the show continues. Nakagawa Koutarou does not ruin the show with her music. In fact, many of the scenes are made much more dramatic due to her works. However, she is no Yuki Kajiura. A show of such high quality seems deserving of an amazing soundtrack, but it is left with an above average one at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and endings of the show are among the best music the show provides. Yoshiki Lisa created an amazing opening for the show. Destin Histoire puts the viewer in the right mood for the show. It is an upbeat song, but it is not so happy that it deceives the viewer (as the show gets dark from time to time). It is not dark enough to scare away people looking for a good story. \\n\\n\r\nKomine Lisa made the first ending, Resuscitated Hope. This song was a perfect ending for each episode. Since the show often ended on a cliff hanger, this song only intensified the suspense. Also, appropriate for a show title in the engrish version of \u201cGothic,\u201d this ending has plenty of Nightwish vibes. Of all the themes for the show, this fit the very best. Unity was the second ending of the show. Also created by Komine Lisa, this song is drastically different from Resuscitated Hope. It is not unfitting for an ending for the show, and it accomplishes everything the first ending did nearly as well. However, this song drops the score dramatically. It is so different from the first ending, that it is a shock to the viewer when it appears. It is not as good as the first, so it seems quite worse than it actually is. This should be unexpected when you go from a Finnish rock style to a folk style suddenly. For those willing to ignore the change, the song becomes attractive over time. However, it is an immediate distraction, and unfortunately is the absolute worst part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI give Gosick a generous 8 in music. I generally don\u2019t pay attention to in show soundtracks, and if I don\u2019t notice it, it deserves about an 8. I noticed this soundtrack from time to time, always in a good way. All of the openings and ends are songs I can listen to over and over again. This show deserves a 10 for its work. I will not give that score, because the music causes what I believe to be the biggest flaw in the show. If the endings had not changed, I would not be as harsh as I have to be.\\n",

            "content": "Review contains possible spoilers.\r\nI find that GOSICK is flawed and weak in every way, and to summon up a commonly used cliche to describe an undesirable mystery,\"it's like watching Scooby-Doo.\"\r\nSo my first comparison will be how Scooby-Doo is, in fact, superior to GOSICK in terms of mystery. Scooby-Doo is an episodic mystery show (similar to GOSICK in this regard) in which a cast of bumbling characters winds up with a mysterious case on their hands, that is always solved (similar to GOSICK). Unlike GOSICK though, Scooby-Doo always introduces it's culprits prior to the solution, and presents CLUES as to HOW the mystery is solved alongthe way. GOSICK has no development in regards to it's mysteries. They are solved *magically* and I mean, without any clues or evidence nearly every time by a \"Fifteen\" YEAR OLD GIRL. She can spot who the cuplrit is by the way he or she holds a gun, for example. She knew that the culprit of murder must be blonde because it was sunny out, for another. Or how about the ever so flattering \"the culprit is black because it was dark out.\" Are you kidding!? So in short, Scooby-Doo is a better mystery because GOSICK is not a mystery. GOSICK is a fantasy anime in which little girls can outwit their older brothers who have detective's licenses.\\n\\n\r\nAs every review has said, Kujo is a garbage character. Even the reviews attempting to explain how wonderful GOSICK is mention that Kujo was a generic protagonist. The story is that he is a highly intelligent Japanese student who is transferred to an imaginary European country. So we have the Japanese highschool student cliche with legs as our lead. How creative. This cliche would have worked if the setting was Japan in the 1920s. I am not willing to embrace this cliche if the setting is supposed to be in Europe though. Just so the teenage Japanese audience could relate to the story, they forcibly needed to add a poorly written Japanese boy as the lead? Kujo is so pointless as a character and shows so little development that I doubt he was necessary to any point of the story except to add a filter for the audience to see through and to stir some \"romantic scenes\" with Victorique.\\n\\n\r\nExcept GOSICK is not a romance. There's twenty-two episodes of light banter between two archetypal characters, and then two episodes of reversal, and we're supposed to believe GOSICK is a romance? Unless you are easily deceived by crying and enormously blatant drama then you might. This kind of finish can be termed as \"wrap up drama,\" in which the story lacks development for eleven episodes or so and then in the final two or so episodes a dramatic plot is concocted to give the show lasting appeal, a technique commonly used in slice of life anime as a way to finish a show. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite (sarcasm incoming) part of said ending though, was when about half way through the series a \"super serious ultra scary dramatic prophecy of great mysteriousness\" was directly told (in a supernatural manner, once again GOSICK would've sat far better as a fantasy) to Kujo by an old dude that he and Victorique would travel far apart and that they would face grave misfortune for the rest of their lives. [[[[SPOILER:]]]] Of course, GOSICK has a happy end. There's no point in introducing this concept of great loss and permanent misfortune if it /does not happen/. Adding in uselessly \"epic\" scenarios and scenes into an anime does not actually make it an epic.\\n\\n\r\nNow a lot of reviews criticize Kujo, but not Victorique. Victorique is a by the book tsundere character. That's about the level of depth she has other than (once again, unrealistically) her incredibly mature voice. The show actually tried to explain her mannerisms in one episode by delving into her \"dark and mysterious and emotional and begrudged\" past. Oh my goodness, laugh out loud for real. Oh sure, a little girl can change the tone and pitch of her voice as well as the way she acts by being locked in a prison... her whole life. Is that scientific? No. Is that possible? Well without any facts, statistics, charts, studies, or maybe even imaginary facts, statistics, charts, and studies I would have to say, no! There is no logic behind her behavior other than \"uh well she was alone for a while and then she completely changed forever.\" Reasonable logic, I think not. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond that her character is loved by many for doing pointlessly childish things and puffing out her cheeks much like every tsundere. And she isn't even voiced by Rie, so like, what the point is, I don't know. She's just another piece of bait to attract fans.\\n\\n\r\nWhat GOSICK really attracts people with is though, is it's Victorian setting (well, and having a small blonde girl as it's cover piece). A few anime share a similar setting in a similar time period - Chrno Crusade, Victorian Romance Emma, and Kuroshitsuji to name a few. The mysteries in this series are so convoluted that this setting isn't even necessary. It's definitely not needed for the mystery, because there is nothing Victorique can't solve, essentially making her solutions as inconceivable as having a futuristic computer solve the mysteries. It also isn't needed for the \"romance\" because it could have been set in any wartime period (or more exact inter-wartime period, or post-wartime period, or whenever more exactly). So what's it needed for? It's needed for an audience is what I draw from this. It's needed so it can be slightly different, but exactly the same. Anime has only scratched the surface of the Victorian setting, and people are highly interested in such a time, so it draws in viewers. I'm not trying to be a cynic here and tell you that it did all this to draw in fanbase but... I actually think that's why GOSICK has the Victorian setting as it's time period because I logically can't think of any other reason.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you're still reading, I must thank you, because I'm about to get into the muckiest part of this piece - the side characters. To begin unfurling this mess, I have to bring out the ditzy teacher. She does nothing except comic relief and drool over the other comic relief guy (whose hair is a drill, ha ha). The second comic relief character, Grevil, Victorique's older brother earlier in the series is portrayed in every episode as an ignoramus. Yet he's the detective and his little sister solves all his mysteries. (What a fantastical fantasy anime this is!) Then in the final arc, much like the two main characters, instead of getting development throughout this 24 episode series, his character suddenly goes grim and serious. This is not character development. This is a re-write. There is no character development in GOSICK, there is only a re-writing of the whole cast in the last few episodes, that is just too unbelievable even for my willing suspension of disbelief to hold. Another character is Avril, a classic dope supplying comic relief (but like the aforementioned two isn't funny either). So the recurring cast are all dopes with the exception of supercomputer Victorique. Single arc characters are the tritest of the bunch though. The antagonists have their flimsy motive or mysterious prophecy (most arcs tend to center more around supernatural beliefs and occurances, despite the mystery tag) and all the side characters are one-dimension at best. Victorique's mom and the Roscoe twins are actually hilarious though, because they create such a crudely dramatic and painfully bad allusion to Alice in Wonderland. I didn't even know that the whole cast was essentially a poor parody until the ending when Kujo was holding a book with a white rabbit and little girl together. So apparently, their obnoxious roles as characters was to simply imply a better work! How classic! GOSICK wishes it could be Heart no kuni no Alice, which is already a fangirl's rendition and (somewhat of an enjoyable butcher) of the original Lewis Caroll staple, forget Alice in Wonderland itself!\\n\\n\r\nTouching on music is almost always subjective in a way, but I just wasn't impressed. There were no tracks that caught my interest, the openings weren't particularly enjoyable, nor were the endings. The voicing as I mentioned earlier felt unbelievable, too, because Victorique has the voice of a forty-year-old woman. So I can't really complain about the sound beyond how average I found it to be. \\n\\n\r\nI'll end with the art and animation. BONES I've seen better from you. The background art was actually pretty nice, but was far too often engulfed by the ridiculous character designs. The animation in my opinion, was rather poor by BONES standards and the awkward positions characters managed to wind up in often amazed me, as well as the messy looking faces of the side characters. I did not find any character enjoyable to look at, and I feel that Bones just had way too much fun with the bold line tool. Also Victorique has a mishapen and malformed Uguu~ face. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I didn't like GOSICK. It was a waste of time to anyone who pays attention to detail and/or wants a mystery anime. And yes, I can say that going into GOSICK I expected a mystery and in every way I was let down. Because this is not a mystery anime, it is a fantasy anime, and I am quite upset that the database won't let me fix this misnomer.",

            "content": "This is a really great anime if you go in with the right mindset and expectations.\r\nStory: 8/10 The story was very good and enjoyable.  The storyline can be divided into micro-scale and macro-scale subplots. On the micro-scale we have Victorique and Kujo\u2019s  adventures/mysteries. These are initially little, stand-alone mysteries that revolve around the legends of the academy where they study. As the series progresses the mysteries become interlinked with more important and far-reaching issues. I think the mini-mysteries were the weakest part of the storyline, as they were waaay too easy for both victorique and the viewer to solve. Fortunately the dud mysteriesdon\u2019t destroy the series and it picks up. I enjoyed their attempt at a \u2018historical\u2019 macro-scale plot. They rewrite/rearrange a good portion of history but they do reference actual historical events. As the series progresses we see the eerie rise of powerful, unstoppable forces and how the characters get swept up by some of these events. I\u2019ll just stress that this is NOT a Death Note style deductive reasoning game of cat and mouse. There are big and small mysteries that are developed throughout the 24 episodes but the main focus is on the character relationships. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. I thought the landscapes were very beautiful and the characters drawn perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: No problems\u2026can\u2019t say much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10. The anime is very character-driven and many of the smaller mysteries are used as plot devices to allow Kujo and Victorique to interact and bond. I liked the chemistry between Kujo and Victorique as partners too. They complemented each other very nicely and made a great team.  I thought Victorique\u2019s character development and balance of brattiness, quirkiness and warmth was a real strength of the series. Interestingly, Victorique\u2019s personality allowed the relationship between her and Kujo to bypass an annoying clich\u00e9 that I see in many other tsundere anime characters. This involves the \u201ccold\u201d character displaying a gesture of affection or warmth at the end of an episode, and then inexplicably acting like it never happened by the beginning of the next episode. This strategy allows the series to drag out that \u201cwarming up\u201d process by the tsundere character at the cost of making the character seem fickle and inconsistent. I thought that Victorique\u2019s odd, demanding and, at times, innocently sadistic personality naturally lent believability to that \u2018two steps forward, one step back\u2019 approach.  The \u201cromance\u201d angle storyline is integral to the plot and arguably the main focus of the series. I would go as far as to say that this is more of a romance/relationship anime than a true detective series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. If you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into this is one of the most enjoyable animes I\u2019ve ever watched. It has enough plot to make it interesting and engaging while not going overboard with the dark/twisted themes. I had just come off of Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom and I was looking for a satisfying and heartwarming anime\u2026which I got with Gosick.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. I think they could have spiced up some of the earlier mysteries, developed the side characters a bit more, and made Victorique struggle a bit more with the detective work but overall it was exactly what I wanted to see when I watched it. Save this anime for a rainy day.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMisc:\\n\r\nLove/Romance: I would say high. It's not a typical high school drama but you definitely feel it.\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: Thankfully none as 15 year old Victorique looks like she's 11 years old.\\n\r\nBlood/Gore: Light. Most of the violence happens in flashbacks or in reconstructions of events. They show blood splatters and a few deaths but that's about it. There's not really any glorified or stylized anime violence.",

            "content": "Gosick was a literary masterpiece of a light novel. The reason being the little girl's dfc was so amazing that as I read each of her words, I imagined my own face brushing up against her chest.\r\nThe adaption from novel to anime from this first episode has only shown me how kakkoi it'll be and that it'll be the most sugoi series of the season, and possibly year. (tl note: kakkoi means cool and sugoi means amazing)\r\nThe little girl, Victorique has some background stuff to her, but it's not really important, what REALLY matter is how bloody cute she is. When you see her yawn,or roll on the floor in boredom, your heart will flatline and you'll cry tears of moe moe ~kyun. She's so adorable the rest of this show doesn't even matter. Detective stuff? I don't know if she thinks she's Conan or Sherlock, but she sure is adorable when she blushes. To add on after watching episode two, there other redeeming features I've noticed Victorique has now. She has an adorable pouting face, and her sarcastic laugh is just amazingly kawaii desu (tl note: kawaii means cute), and the way she's so stoic around corpses makes me want to cuddle with her in a graveyard.\\n\\n\r\nThe guy who accompanies her is some baka beta male who dances for her when she commands (or maybe he's a guy who likes being bossed around by cute little girls like I am). He's a baka gaijan in some country with a lame nick name (Dark Reaper/Springtime Reaper, he's a baka inu so who cares). Anyways, all you need to know is he's totally her manservant. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all I rate Gosick as a 10/10. This anime was so suteki desu ne~",

            "content": "Gosick received a lot of hype before it aired, and many people looked forward to the airing of this \"masterpiece\" novel. Will Studio Bones do it justice?\r\nI would like to mention that I have not read the novel and thus I am only reviewing the anime version.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\n I am a sucker for detective / mystery anime. The first episode, however, did not meet up to my expectations. It introduced the characters all right, and I did enjoy the little mystery they had. However, being a fan of detective anime / stories, such as Detective Conan, I found the case pretty simple and repetitivein many shows.\\n\r\nBut, my views changed by the second episode. One cannot help but admire Victorique's detective skills, and the two part episode (2 and 3) proved to be entertaining. It was also suspensful in a way, since viewers are left with cliff hangers at the end of the second episode.\\n\r\nIt might be far too early to judge the overall story, but I give it a 9/10 at the moment, and we will see how the whole series unfolds, though I have really high expectations at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\n I'm not surprised at the rating I give the artwork. Studio Bones generally produces eye catching art style, and Gosick did do justice in that. The character designs are interesting (though many say that Victorique resembles Shinku from Rozen Maiden. But that was the author's style, not the studio's. Besides, it suits her!) The opening and ending have very beautiful artwork, and the style is somewhat different than what is IN the show, but still captivating. I give it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\n The music accompanying the series is both mysterious and captivating. It actually draws the viewers in, and sets an overall mood for the show. The opening and Ending songs (Opening by Yoshiki*lisa and Ending by Lisa Komine) are very catchy. The intro is amusingly happy and hyper at the beginning, then at the chorus very enjoyable to the ears. I think it was very well done! As for the ending, many fans rave that it is better than the opening. I personally prefer the opening, though the ending is nothing short of masterpiece. I give the sound a 9/10 only because the music in the show is somewhat repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\n It is a bit too early to judge the characters of the show, so I cannot truthfully rate them. First, let us take Victorique, the main female protagonist. What I adore about her is the fact that she is not only a good detective that puts a pipe in her mouth whenever sleuthing (Sherlock Holmes?) but the fact that after those moments she is a girl in the end. Her random antics (barrel roll! I'm so bored!) keep the viewer entertained, and intrigued by her inner personality. And viewers still wonder what sentimental value her \"gold necklace\" has. Was it her mothers? (I somewhat believe she had a relation to the villain in a way?)\\n\r\nNext is Kujou, the main male protagonist. He is quickly introduced, and for some reason is attached to Victorique from the moment he set eyes on her. What I enjoy is his somewhat \"split\" personality (one moment provides the comic relief, another moment he is dead serious). However, the fact that he is the \"third son and tries to surpass his brothers\" is somewhat cliche? I don't know, maybe it's just me, but this is present in other anime too. But, Kujou proves to be a promising character and \"side kick\" to Victorique.\\n\r\nOther minor characters are also appealing in their own way (a hyperactive teacher?) but some somehow have weird character designs (the Detective and his \"drill\" hair).\\n\r\nI give the characters and 8/10 at the moment since no further information is given about them, and we are only on the third episode, aren't we?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\n Gosick happens to be entertaining, and viewers sleuth alongside the characters, wondering what will happen next. Some cannot wait for the next episode to come, while others are patient enough to think about the mystery during the one week period of time. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\n Gosick looks like a very promising anime, and the fact that it is being produced by Studio Bones only makes it more appealing. Detective / mystery genre fans will not only enjoy Victorique's sleuthing with Kujou, but also her \"cute\" personality while not being serious.",

            "content": "1924.\r\nA mere 6 years after WWI, the fictional European country of Saubure is the location of the prestigious Saint Marguerite Academy, where \"The Golden Fairy\" spends her days in chronic boredom eating sweets and reading in the tower library. One student that attends this school, \"The Black Reaper,\" ventures to the very top of this tower library to see this legendary student literally rolling around, and so, an unusual bond forms between the two. \r\nGosick follows the story between Kazuya Kujou and Victorique de Blois, as they either dive headfirst into the various ghost stories or legends that frequent their school and try to unravelthe mysteries surrounding each, or these troubles find them. These mysteries however, are rather mediocre and can be solved by the viewer with a little common sense. Victorique's flawless explanations at the end of these short mysteries (usually 3-4 episodes) really only make others look rather lacking in intelligence, mostly Kujou. However, I do not believe the main appeal of Gosick is the mysteries themselves, but rather the superb character interactions. \\n\\n\r\nMany times, I found myself watching an episode of Gosick to watch more of the very entertaining interactions between Kujou and Victorique rather than learn more about the mysteries they found themselves in. Victorique, who was ever charming and typically tsundere, displayed cute antics with Kujou passively sighing and laughing. They had excellent chemistry with one another. Their friendship deepens quite a bit in the course of the show, and that was what made the ending and overall experience quite enjoyable. There are some particular moments which were heartwarming and quite emotional, after they realize the importance their presence has for the other. Clutching a small necklace in times of desperation, after all, is sometimes all one needs to keep on living, to see another day, for the sake of the other. \\n\\n\r\nTo make a comparison, this is also particularly one of the reasons I enjoyed Spice and Wolf so much, not for the rather confusing economic and business sense, but the interactions between the two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt in Gosick was very well done and detailed. Saubure was rich and colorful, and characters were animated wonderfully. There are many settings to enjoy, such as the tower library, the town itself, theaters and the rich countryside. It's always nice to see the artist giving viewers a pleasurable viewing experience and diversifying things. \\n\\n\r\nThere was a plot weaved in carefully at around the middle of the series, involving a particularly despicable Marquis and his own self centered plans. Though somewhat unnoticeable in the beginning, the final few episodes of Gosick manage to explode this plot  into a hotpot of emotions, ranging from completely despicable to heartfelt. After a great wind has descended on the world and splits nations apart, comes the time when the relationship between Kujou and Victorique becomes most difficult. Even so, they live for the sake of the other. \\n\\n\r\nSound is minimal, but I felt this helped to enhance the atmosphere of Gosick. What little music is present was fitting for the situation, whether on a speeding train or a platform addressing the country itself. The opening is \"Destin Histoire\" by yoshiki lisa, a catchy pop-rock song with quite the nice animation to go with it. The opening utilizes a pleasant and unique water color style of art, giving even more diversity to the already beautiful art style Gosick utilizes. There are two pieces of ending music, \"Resuscitated Hope\" by Komine Lisa and \"Unity\" by the same artist. They were appropriate for the mood that followed the ending of an episode. \\n\\n\r\nI want to especially applaud Victorique's seiyuu, Aoi Yuuki, for an excellent and laudable performance. She gave a great range of voice for her character, from the bored, sarcastic tones of Victorique to her emotional tones especially as the \"wind\" approaches, with particular mention to Victorique's despair. I do believe the end of episode 22 will tug at quite a few people. \\n\\n\r\nGosick is an overall enjoyable anime that tells the story of two very different people as they tackle fables, legends, stories, and their own shortcomings. Gosick should be viewed not with the mysteries themselves as the focal point, but as the story of Kujou's and Victorique's slow friendship that keeps them together, even with the tragic \"wind\" that will inevitably separate the two. Holding hands, the petite Fairy looks over the shoulder of the reliable and forgiving Reaper, as they face the world.",

            "content": "Gosick is a difficult show to review, it is also a rather difficult show to watch if you're expecting a masterful detective story - which is doubtless the preconception many viewers will have prior to beginning this.\r\nGosick is not a particularly strong detective series - the detective work is generally summarized by Victorique in 1 minute out of a 60 minute story arc, and whatever clues she alludes to are invariably invisible to the viewer.  In spite of this Gosick is actually an extremely enjoyable show to watch: the drama works very well and the characters are extremely likeable (ridiculous hairstyles aside).  \r\nThestory begins with Kujo, a foreign student arriving from Japan to study in the Alps who is quickly cast aside as a pariah by his fellow students.  Being completely friendless, he goes to the library to discover the Rapunzel-like Victorique who is only allowed to live within the confines of the library.\\n\r\nAt first Victorique regards Kujo as a means to alleviate her boredom, but as time progresses they sneak away for secret adventures... I shalln't give too much away, but the relationship which develops between the pair is particularly charming.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention should be given to the artwork of Gosick.  Throughout the series scenes are populated with richly detail backgrounds and finely animated characters - it's a pleasant and rare luxury not to see any cut corners with the animation.\\n\\n\r\nIn short then, the strong aspects outlined above more than make up for the shortcomings of the detective story.  I wouldn't say this is essential viewing by any means, but it is nevertheless an enjoyable diversion.",

            "content": "Irritating. This anime is REALLY irritating if you hate a tsundere loli who acts like she's the boss and an idiot main character who goes behind her like a dog.  I never felt connected to a character like I do in other anime. It's just like watching some stranger's life and not caring whether they die.\r\nWhen I watched a few episodes of the anime, I realised that this anime is a horrible mystery anime. Terribly fails at depicting mysterious situations. Before the case even started, I could easily tell who the culprit was and the story behind it and I'm sure anyone can. It'sa WASTE OF TIME if you're a mystery fan and watching this for mystery.\\n\\n\r\nWell, at least it has a story that follows something. But the character's BG stories are just as if a drunk person made them up. It's like they just needed to make some characters, made them, and gave them a background story to justify what crazy things their doing.  I just didn't get the whole point of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe police. They're lame. I get it that they're trying to depict an ignorant bunch of officers but their stupidity is over the top. They get beaten by some 15 year old kid. Heh.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has decent ED music. The second ED was the best and depicted what was going on in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor mystery fans, it's a big disappointment, for romance fans, it takes too long to get to the romance part. \\n\\n\r\nWhy did I contunue watching this? To tell people not to watch it, of course.\\n\r\nWell, the only thing I liked about this is that it tells about the sadness of war and romance between the irritating two main characters. Which had a pretty nice ending. Also, it showed a few things about how people were during that time. And they showed \"the Turk\" yey!\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime COULD be better. But unfortunately, it isn't good. Lot of people might say that 3 is too bad for it, but the more I think about how irritating it was, the lesser score I give.",

            "content": "~I shall now reconstruct the fragments of chaos...~\r\nA mystery-based anime set in old times? Sounds bland.\r\nThink again.\r\nGosick is a genuinely interesting, entangled web of thought provoking mystery and emotion. Starting out quite slow with a cliche \"mysterious girl meets guy\" scenario, i didn't expect to experience great amounts of character attachment. Like many, i came with the assumption that the show would develop into a dramatic crime-busting series, and not much else.\r\nIf you hadn't already gathered from my tone, i was obviously wrong in my preconceptions of the show, and here's why...\r\nThe mystery genre is often associated with a slow rate of progression, plot-heavy content,and a mind boggling level of complexity that outpaces even the viewer. Although i would definitely not imply that Gosick is easy to follow; it always retains a curious atmosphere - and seems to keep me engaged with not only the story, but the state of the characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nSome of my judgments can't be re-enforced by the first few episodes, as there's an amount of slow building to begin with - preliminary events that follow a slightly formulaic approach, but are necessary for the foreshadowing of much more significant happenings. By no means are these examples of filler though, as it becomes apparent quite soon that Gosick is a show that derives a lot of strength from its detail. \\n\\n\r\nMany times throughout, i found myself internally saying \"oooohhhhhhh...\", as it gave relevance to the most obscure of references: \"fragments of chaos\" in Gosick's case. The manipulation of the viewers' viewpoint when it comes to conveying the mystery aspect of the show never ceased to catch me off-guard. Each time, it brought about wholesome conclusions that actually added something new to the bigger picture, and were even meaningfully referred back to later.\\n\r\n- and so if you can appreciate plot twists, take a note. \\n\\n\r\nGosick is confident in its ability to make fluent sense of the countless small details that link everything together seamlessly - and therefore i would say that the story line is masterfully assembled. I obviously won't reveal too much, but as time goes on, Gosick develops from a deceivingly simple mystery concept, into a radically more intense, passionately fought battle of human corruption. Its emotional sway (having more of a \"part\" later) is effective due to the character development...\\n\\n\r\nWe haven't covered the development yet? \\n\r\nRight...\\n\r\nWell simply put, the protagonist of the story is a relatively generic, but passionate lad - Kazuya. For the most part, he serves as the relatable voice of reason, and the viewers. Victorique on the other hand, is much more unique. She's 2-faced for sure, able to flick between states of anger, happiness, and all-consuming boredom funnily enough. The comedic twists to the characters in the form of particularly relatable personalities allows for good establishment of the shows contrast between themes - and this bares relevance to the contrast of genres.\\n\\n\r\nWhat contrast you ask?\\n\r\nWell if you hadn't already checked the tags, romance becomes another major theme of the show as it develops. It's particularly interesting the way this romance progresses, as the characters' developing understanding of each other, and awareness of the very prominent \"us versus the world\" idea allows of this manifestation of deeper feelings to shape their decisions. Although with a frustrating distance to begin with, as the duo open up to each other throughout, so does the plot line - beyond description.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the presentation throughout is definitely on-par with the wonderful development and detail of both the context and characters. I found the soundtrack in particular to be one of the best I've ever heard!\\n\\n\r\nMake of it what you must... If you're looking for more than just a mystery - something perplexing and clever with a more personal aura, you've got it!\\n\\n\r\nI've tried to leave this quite open-ended, as to invoke a sense of curiosity - the second part of the show definitely outdoes the first.",

            "content": "My Wellspring of Wisdom is telling me to review Gosick!\r\nWell here I am, I'm the master of the universe.\r\nFrom the makers of Sword of the Stranger, FMA: Brotherhood, and Darker than Black sequel. Studio Bones!\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nGosick is your natural detective tale, love story, slice of life.  It is brimming with mystery, set in a fictional European countryside called Saubure (Sauville), adjacent to France and Italy. Its plot follows in the footsteps of Lupin, Detective Conan, Heaven's Memo Pad, hell even Death Note. Our protagonist and deuteragonist is Kujo and Victorique De Blois, respectively. Their mutual friendship eventually blossoms into a partnership. \r\nArt: 7/10\r\nFor 2011,the Art is above average. That isn't saying much, however the cinematography and the detailed description of the European countryside is spot on. The producers and Bones really did their homework, and parleyed a few vacation trips in order to capture the essence, It isn't uncommon for Mangakas and Animators to visit real life locations to maximize surrealism and breaking the 4th wall.  Ryohgo Narita the creator of a very popular series, Baccano! did the same thing by visiting the Chicago Train Station.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first marathoned and binged on the show, the first alluring thing that  \\n\r\nattracted me was not only Victorique's sharp wit, and seething bluntness. But the unmistakable OST, that is eerily similar to Code Geass. Doing some homework, I came to realize that the soundtrack was composed by Kotaro Nakagawa, the very same composer of Code Geass's OST. This is one aspect of Gosick that very much excels in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Kujo is a dunce. An overbearing third son who can never ever match his older brothers. The Fredo Corleone of the family, the black sheep, a weakling, an outcast. A freaking pariah! However he seems to connect with our deuteragonist Victorique de Blois, also an exiled child who had never been embraced in the warmth of love. Her disdain for the world and her cynical pessimistic outlook on life attributes to this fact. She trusts no one with good reason, she was raised in the dungeon cellar of her father's Mansion, due to the fact that her mother was illegitimate, and a criminal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 8/10, I'd recommend this to everyone and anyone. It is very subtle, dark, humorous at times. The tropes are common and have been done before , Gosick revamps them and takes it to another level. Victorique reminds me of Taiga from Toradora, both short and sweet with take no prisoners attitude, and a vicious mean streak. Both will wreathe vengeance on whomever crosses their path. They both also have a calloused stone heart that will open to a lucky boy in time.They are two tsunderes that I hold very close to my weaboo heart.",

What's impressive so far is that Victorique literally seems to be finding the answers out of nowhere  thanks to some kinda fountain of wisdom  and with the very few hints she givesto the main character you can reconstruct how she found out those things. Though some are a bit predictable she's still ahead of me as a viewer even though she doesn't witness what we do so yeah overall godlike character who on top of that is extremely cute WITHOUT any of those fucking clich\u00e9s\\n\r\nshe's not too much of a tsundere  and she's not plain dere either  which is good considering what we've been fed with this year . \\n\r\nAlso the art is amazing I literally fell in love with it , the OP is particularly great since it looks like you're seeing the drawings on paper and they start moving and not just an ''animation'' . Mentioning the animation that is on top of that rather good so far.\\n\r\nThe sound isn't astonishingly good but it's still really pleasant the OSTs are well chosen and fits each scenes \\n\r\nThere really isn't any character I hate at all , even the inspector who's completely obnoxious but has one kick-ass hairstyle ... I don't believe anyone will be able to pull it off  good luck cosplayers !\\n\\n\r\nSo , to finish I'll say gosick is a really enjoyable anime and I'm impatiently waiting to see how it's going to end , if it keeps getting better it'll probably reach my top 10 animes of all time.\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nSome anime you actually CAN judge by their cover. Fairy Tail is a generic Shonen Jump title, while Sekirei is an echii harem comedy series. Gosick is not one of these cases. Gosick is a mystery anime set in the 1920s that seems to star a little girl dressed in a Victorian Era maid outfit. Most people would look at the cover and say, \"I'm not the damn Subway guy! Why the HELL would I ever want to watch this shit!?\" I was originally one of those people, but I kept getting recommendations to watch it and finally I caved. Surprisingly...Gosick is actually pretty damngood!\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nThe title \"Gosick\" is actually a misspelling of the English word \"Gothic\" and the series supposedly gets its title from being inspired by Victorian Gothic fiction. It does indeed borrow heavily from a famous  work of Victorian Gothic fiction: Sherlock Holmes. The main character is a detective named Victorika, who mostly spends her time cooped up in her rooftop apartment complaining of boredom. She solves mysteries far more to alleviate the boredom than from any actual concern for other human beings and displays many sociopath traits. She is completely unfazed by murder and is extremely withdrawn, cold, and calculating. However, she possesses a high genius level intellect and an astounding capacity for deductive/inductive reasoning and reconstructing crime scenes. Her only friend is an extremely loyal companion that comes from a military background and serves as the normal individual that can actually interact with other people. Victorika also suffers from an extreme addiction to a white, powdery stimulant...sugar. You thought I was going to say cocaine didn't you? Although later sub-plots develop involving Victorika's family, the basic premise and characters are directly lifted from Sherlock Holmes. The far more famous mystery anime Detective Conan (Case Closed in the United States) also claims to take inspiration from Sherlock Holmes, but honestly Gosick is MUCH closer to capturing the tone and feel of the original. Detective Conan involves a lot of goofy comedy scenes involving Conan's kindergarten friends that would NOT fit into Gothic Genre novel! Gosick actually keeps its dark tone quite consistently with only Victorika's deadpan sarcasm and endless insults providing comic relief. This relates to the other main reason why Gosick is the more faithful adaptation. Sherlock Holmes was a total dick in the original novels! Shinichi Kudo from Detective Conan is simply far too nice and caring to be an accurate, modern day adaptation of the classic character. Now I should address an important question. If you haven't seen Detective Conan and have never read any Sherlock Homes, why would you want to see Gosick? The mysteries in Gosick are actually quite fun and the overall plot is fast paced and keeps things interesting. The character interactions are hilarious and you want to keep watching to see how your favorite characters will all end up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\"I'm NOT a psychopath...I'm actually a high functioning sociopath. Do your research!\" - Sherlock Holmes\\n\\n\r\nI've mentioned already that Victorika is a modern Sherlock Holmes adaptation and actually one of the more amusing ones I've seen in recent memory along with Dr. House and BBC Sherlock! However, where does she fit as an anime archetype? People often classify her as a \"Tsundere\" type character, but that archetype actually has a wide range. Most Tsunderes tend to frequently yell shrilly, boast loudly, slap around the male protagonist, and in general annoy the crap out of me for every second they are onscreen. Examples of this include: Asuka Soryu, Naru Narusegawa, Haruhi Suzumiya, and even Revi from Black Lagoon. The other side of the Tsundere spectrum is the cold and withdrawn extremely\"INTJ\" type who just seem mildly annoyed at all times, is known for deadpan, biting insults and although extremely intelligent is just kind of a dick. This is almost exclusively reserved in anime for male characters like Paul von Oberstein from LOTGH. However, that is exactly where Victorika falls on the spectrum and this makes her a rather unusual character for an anime. Especially considering she is the main character and not just a minor side character. The other main character is the Watson character named Kazuya Kujo. He is extremely nice, caring, relatable, but isn't afraid to stand up to Victorika when he needs to. He is NOT a complete beta male and in only the 3rd episode is using brass knuckles to save Victorica's ass from an assassin and beating the shit out of him. Kujo's military family background gives him a strong sense of discipline and honor. He wishes to prove himself to his elder siblings and to his father, who has always overlooked him. There are other highly amusing characters as well including Victorika's idiotic half-brother, who takes credit for her work despite being an incredibly inept detective. Overall, these are fun characters that I really enjoyed!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI don't feel like going too in depth with the art and sound this time. Neither are particularly amazing, but also not bad by any means. Basically they are pretty average relative to 2011 when this was made. If you like mystery anime with fun characters, this is the anime for you! If you like Victorian Era Gothic fiction and in particular you love Sherlock Holmes, then this is the anime for you! I went in to this anime with virtually no expectations and I came out pleasantly surprised. I award Gosick a very solid 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "I rarely ever find myself liking a series or movie about detectives and strange mysteries because I find that they become extremely repetitive, always following the same formula over and over again where your protagonist(s) uses the evidence at a crime scene to solve a crime. What sets Gosick apart from these aformentioned shows is that it isn't entirely focused on the mysteries and detective work but also places a lot of emphasis on the relationship between the main characters, adding a sort of slice-of-life-ish and romantic side to a story which would have otherwise been a more generic detective show.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story takes placemainly in 1924 and begins with Kujo Kazuya, a Japanese transfer student, attending a European school in the fictional nation of Sauville, situated in between France and Italy. Being racially different and unfortunately associated with a scary character from a local folk tale by his classmates, he becomes somewhat of a social outcast who meets the small and adorable, but short-tempered and anti social Victorique who is actually a genius detective spending most of her time in the botanical gardens at the top of the school library. And thus begins their adventures together, unraveling the strange mysteries and crimes which occur throughout the small European nation of Sauville and forging a an ever-growing relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThere is actually very little I can fault the story with. Most of the cases the due takes on span a few episodes at most, creating what may seem like small story arcs. However, in most of the cases, there are some small clues or facts that will carry on into other cases. From prior experience in other anime, this always creates some confusions and incoherencies, but Gosick executed this almost perfectly, creating an extremely interesting and intriguing story. It also goes without saying that this should not be an anime where you can completely shut your brain off while watching it. By the end, there is, at most, one or two questions which I still had regarding the story, but they were essentially very minor in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real flaw I saw in the story is, while it not may matter to other people, the pacing. I honestly felt like some of the cases Victorique took on we're finished way too quickly, especially when some facts and clues conveniently popped up at the time she needed them. This is particularly evident when she takes on the greatest mystery in the history of Sauville, which she unravels with extreme ease. Despite this, she always tackles the cases in a realistic and understandable manner, always providing concise and reasonable explanations as to how the cases played out, this being one of Gosick's strong points.\\n\\n\r\nReturning from my slight tangent, the pacing makes everything a little difficult to take in, especially in the latter half in the series. Information is constantly thrown at you and I had to replay quite a few scenes to really grasp everything that was happening. Due to the somewhat quick pacing, I felt as though there were some missing scenes which should've been there for the sake of progressing the story along more smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story excelled greatly in Victorique's everyday life of being bored, constantly bossing Kujo around, being cute, and solving mysteries/crimes and I could've watched this anime forever should it have stayed like that because it was just really that much fu to watch. At a certain point in the anime, Gosick begins to transition from an episodic/multi-episodic structure into a more singular story line whereby Victorique uncovers some dark truths which cause large scale events to unfold and place her at the centre of it. This part of the story had potential and could've made for an epic conclusion to the anime, especially considering the build up leading to it (like I have said before, Gosick really does a good job of taking elements from one arc and  exploring them in another), but it ultimately fizzles out because of pacing issues which also led to a few unexplained plot points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are Kujo and Victorique. Aside from his growing feelings for Victorique, Kujo is hardly developed at all. He grows slightly in confidence, detective intelligence, and in physical strength, and you learn small facts about his family and home, but that is about all. He remains mainly as a \"companion\" character to Victorique because almost all of his actions are for Victorique, something which I feel a main character shouldn't really be, especially when the anime primarily focuses on him and not the star of the show, Victorique.\\n\\n\r\nVictorique is the only character in Gosick who receives any sort of extremely meaningful character development and her alone makes this show worth watching. Through Kujo and Victorique's endeavours, you learn about her twisted past and her reasons for being as anti-social as she is. Not only that, she develops from a fragile and scared girl into a much more confident and strong woman, and this is one of Gosick's strengths, alongside being one of the better developed characters that I've seen in all the anime I have watched.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is as a supporting cast should be. They don't receive any development and they aren't interesting enough for us to want them to receive any development. They are there for comic relief, to relay information between the two main characters Kujo and Victorique, or to create conflict between or around Kujo and Victorique. However, there is Avril, one pathetic excuse of a romantic rival to Victorique. She's actually a really likeable character, being lively and extremely out going, almost the complete opposite to Victorique. Aside from being a catalyst for Victorique's developing feelings for Kujo through occasionally making Victorique feel a little jealous of her, she has no role. This is simply because the story makes it so plainly obvious that Kujo and Victorique will always be together and removing her existence from the story would essentially change nothing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is great. Quality listen. The first closing is absolutely legendary, probably the only closing that I've watched as much as the opening. So you can probably tell that when it was replaced with the second closing that I was extremely sad and disappointed, especially since I'm not a fan of that type of music. Simply put, I disliked the second closing.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was great as well, constantly emphasising the atmosphere and helping me immerse myself in the mysterious world of Gosick.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely brilliant. The detail which is put into the 1920's clothing, interior design, city layout, and architecture was astonishing and really helped immerse me into the historical setting. Other features of the world of Gosick like the countryside and forests were also extremely detailed and beautiful. I also want to say that the art style used in the opening is a really nice touch, being unique and different to the art in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation didn't shine as much as the art did but there were times when it did such as in a fight scene or two or when a fire started to grow out of control.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are very few detective movies or series which I have loved as much as Gosick. I was completely engrossed in the intricate story, and fell in love with Victorique from the moment I first laid eyes on her and all throughout the story as she was superbly developed as a character. This is more than just a detective and mystery anime, as I have said before, adding small elements of other genres and therefore creating a more complete anime which I will probably treasure for a long time to come. Subjectively, the only flaw I saw in this anime was the pacing of the story and the somewhat anticlimactic ending. If you haven't gotten a hold of the fact that I strongly recommend this anime, then I'll quickly say it; I strongly recommend this anime to just about everyone since, while being a primarily detective/mystery anime, it contains enough elements from other genres for many people to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading! Any feedback is very much appreciated!",

            "content": "To the rhetorical question: \"Why would I watch a mystery anime with mediocre mysteries?\", I provide the following four rebuttals.\r\n     1. \"I don't mind mediocre mysteries.\"\r\n     2. Heartwarming character interactions and development\r\n     3. Awesome loli detective with puffy cheeks.\r\n     4. Beautiful Victorian setting and clothing.\r\nGosick is a so-called mystery anime set in aftermath of World War I in the fictitious country of Sauville. The anime follows the exploits of Victorique and her servant/friend/partner, Kujo, as they unravel the mysteries surrounding Victorique's origin and the impending world conflict. However, despitebeing a mystery anime, the mysteries in this anime are not its main appeal. To understand the flaws in these mysteries, consider the mystery manga/anime Detective Conan. Detective Conan takes tender love and care to lay out clues, evidence and suspects so that it is easy for the reader to follow the detective's train of thought. However, to this date, I have yet to completely 100% solve a mystery in Conan before the main detectives; the mysteries manage to maintain their complexity despite being thoroughly scrutinized up into the point that they are solved. In high contrast, it's impossible to follow Victorique's game-breakingly fast train of thought and yet your hunches about the mystery always end up as correct. In conclusion, the mysteries written into Gosick are shallow and yet predictable, and there is really nothing impressive about Victorique's ability to solve them.\\n\\n\r\nSo then, how would a mystery anime with middle-rate mysteries maintain the interest of its viewers. Quite simply, the individual mysteries are mere pieces of a larger whole. If one considers the anime as using mysteries an unconventional method to reveal plot points rather than as a series of individual cases in which our heroes tackle one by one, the mystery on the grand scale becomes immensely complex. Suddenly the story is riddled with twists and foreshadowing as thick as a jungle and just as convoluted. Each smaller mystery becomes part of a larger story, a tale surrounding a lonely girl and the circumstances in which she came to this world. Roughly a half way through the anime, the scale of the anime blows up exponentially, involving things like conspiracy in the royalty and under-the-table political dealings. Despite the growing number of threads in this story, in the end they all manage to wind themselves down and point towards a specific event, the outbreak of which clearly defines the last two episodes. Indeed the events of the anime can be thought of as the fuse to a small bomb places at the last two episodes which blows up quite literally into the climax of the story. After that explosive event blows away all previous setting and development, the story decides to wrap itself up in a heartwarming bundle. All in all, a good tale.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story maybe good, it is the characters that stand out in this anime. The relationship between Kujo and Victorique is a complicated one to say the least. Most of the time, Kujo dotes on Victorique like a father dotes on his spoiled daughter, he constantly brings her candy and sweets, and often carries her around when not carrying her luggage. In return Victorique abuses Kujo physically and verbally while demanding more sweets or else rolling around on the floor like a spoiled brat. Kujo tolerates all this, but once Victorique steps out of line in front of other, he thoroughly chastises her like the typical Asian parent. You may notice that I make a lot of father-daughter comparisons when describing their relationship. Well there is nothing incestual between; the point is that they care very deeply for each other. Their relationship is far beyond mere platonic friends and yet they aren't quite in the romantic area yet, the way they see each other is most aptly described as beloved family. It is this special bond between them that allows them to cross fate, time, and space in order to see each other one more time. The supporting cast is quite large, and they have their fair share of heartwarming moments for being supporting cast. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the production quality of Gosick is quite solid. The setting of a early 20th century Victorian European country is drawn beautifully, with fantastic architecture on the buildings, gorgeous frilly dresses on the women, and awesome suits with those scarf-necktie things on the men. The animation is quite good although at times the quality sometimes drops, especially and most unfortunately during action scenes. The sound is pretty decent, BGM and OP and ED all are listenable but not too memorable. Special props go to Yuuki Aoi, the seiyuu of Victorique, for doing an awesome job voicing a cool, smart, yet spoiled and bratty loli detective. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if any of items 1-4 in the introduction appeal to you, it won't hurt for you to give this anime a shot.\\n\\n\r\nQuestions, comments, criticisms, and compliments are welcomed whether you found this review helpful or not. \\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nTo me, Gosick (a play on the word \"Gothic\") is the token example of an anime that seems mediocre and flawed at first, only for it throw the viewer a complete curveball and significantly pick up during the second half until it turns into something truly unique and enjoyable. I thought I had this show pegged at around the halfway point, but once it started to go in a more over-aching direction rather than an episodic one, the tone of the show did a 180 degree turn. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nSynopsis: Set during 1924 in Saubure, a small (and fictional) European country in the Alps,Gosick follows a Japanese boy named Kazuya Kujo who has been sent to study abroad at the prestigious Saint Marguerite Academy. He has a lot of trouble fitting in due to his black eyes and hair, which bear resemblance to \"The Reaper who comes in the Spring\"; a figure from a ghost story that all of the students at the academy actually believe, making them fear Kujo. However, he soon discovers that he is not the only one at the academy to be labeled a monster when he meets a small golden haired girl named Victorique, who the students refer to as \"The Golden Fairy of the Library\" (from the story \"The Golden Fairy of the High Tower\"). Supposedly intelligent enough to not even need to attend classes, Victorique turns out to be the only thing that keeps the area's police force operating as she is the one who is called upon whenever an unsolvable mystery arises and, of course, solves it. Despite her indifference to him, Kujo repeatedly returns to the library to visit Victorique until they become close friends and work together to solve whatever mysteries/problems they are presented with, namely Victorique's dark and complicated past.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Gosick is often described as a mystery/detective show, I would strongly disagree with that characterization.  In fact, the mysteries and \"detective work\"  were one of the weaker points of the show in my opinion. Gosick is more of a historical-fiction drama a subtle, overarching plot that finally comes together at the end of the anime and ends up being the saving grace of the pseudo-episodic plot. So if you are looking for a good mystery anime about detectives, you won't find it here. However, if you are looking for a good historical  drama with romantic elements and strong influence from the mystery genre, you will likely enjoy Gosick.\\n\\n\r\n As previously mentioned, Gosick first opens with an episodic style of story telling; one mystery after another is presented to Kujo and Victorique, they investigate, and Victorique solves the mystery with her deus ex machina-like \"power\" which she refers to as \"the wellspring of wisdom\". These mysteries are all mildly amusing, but mediocre due to shoddiness and lack of emphasis put in the investigative parts of the mysteries that make it so the viewer can't possibly solve the mystery before Victorique explains what happened. In case you couldn't infer this, the episodic mysteries are not Gosick's strength.\\n\\n\r\nAs these smaller mysteries are going on, there is a much, MUCH bigger mystery that slowly gets unraveled as the show progresses involving Victorique's past, her family, government conspiracies, an alchemist, magicians, and a whole lot more.  THIS, my friends, is the reason you should watch Gosick. The over-aching plotline of the anime takes quite a bit of time to develop, but it creates a lot of suspense and intrigue in an otherwise uneventful show and then manages to completely exceed the expectations you may have had for its resolution. Gosick's true plot explores mature themes such as dedication to one's family, the ways that love can either mend or destroy your life, alienation, and what causes humans to become emotionally attached to each other. The result is something truly wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nThe romantic aspect of the show, which receives quite a lot of focus, follows the same general model as the main plot does; it starts off as nothing special. Just a bunch of classic tsundere  bullshit that gets very old very fast. However, the romance takes a very serious turn at around the same time the plot does. We are actually presented with legitimate reasons for Victorique being so tsundere and reasons for Kujo putting up with it; the viewer actually feels and understands the emotional attachment that the two have for each other and it really resonated with me by the end of the anime even though I wasn't that into it at first.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I wish they had just dropped the episodic mystery thing all together and focused on the true plot, because that would have made for a much more entertaining and consistent story. Regardless, I very much enjoyed Gosick's plot; it is compelling and unpredictable with an overall well-written romance.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nVery fluent and bright animation that's always pleasant to look at. I'm a big fan of the character designs and atmosphere as well. Just visit Gosick's page on MAL and look at the cover picture; something about the body language of Victorique and the dimly-lit, somber atmosphere is just so engrossing to me. It captures the style of the anime very well. I really like the art style of  this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe in-show tracks are well done as are the endings and the catchy opening; an overall average/above-average soundtrack depending on preference. I'm adding on an extra point because of how much I loved Aoi Yukki as the voice of Victorique; the personality and unique flair that she brings to the role is awesome and provides a different  take on what could have been a stereotypical tsundere character. There is no dub for Gosick, but the sub has very nice voice acting for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThere is a slew of interesting characters throughout Gosick's large cast, including comic relief characters, sinister antagonists, antiheros, and more. There are only two primary leads though, those being Kujo and Victorique. \\n\\n\r\nKujo, the third born son of a high ranking officer of the Japanese Imperial Army, was basically raised to be a man's man. He was constantly scolded for being so \"girly\", and was forced to only like things that a man should like. While you can see the influence of this upbringing in his character, it is also very apparent that his personality is very contrary to those strict rules that were imposed upon him. This is my favorite part about Kujo's character because it goes along with the theme of dealing with alienation/being different, which, while never truly focused on during the show, is one of it's better themes. As a protagonist, Kujo is your typical male counterpart to a tsundere girl on the outside, but a much more deep and complex character on the inside. However, as I've mentioned many times before, the unique and compelling side of him  doesn't come out of him until towards the end of the show (except when they are revealing his backstory). In the end I thought Kujo was a good character; not great, but good. He filled his intended role more than adequately. \\n\\n\r\nThe other major character, Victorique, is an interesting case. I had a very love/hate relationship with her throughout Gosick. At first, I liked her. She was pretty adorable (her sarcastic laugh slayed me when I first heard it XD) and her voice actor did a very good job with her. As the show started to get repetitive, however, so did Victorique's humor. She was on the fast track to becoming yet another annoying tsundere and I was sort of over her. Then, the final act of Gosick kicked in and I loved her more than ever before! She becomes a very strong female lead with a fascinating past, interesting motivations, and much more that I wish I could talk about, but can't. Rarely do you see a female character with such mental strength and intelligence in anime, and that is a breath of fresh air. Overall, Victorique is awesome, but she is still only my 2nd favorite character in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters (including my favorite character) are too numerous for me to talk about and some of them could delve into spoiler territory, so I won't talk about them except to say this: the majority of them kick ass. While I wasn't a big fan of the teacher, the side characters that are centered around the main plot (you know the ones, fans) are just epic as all hell. I'd be shocked if you didn't get attached to at least one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gosick has a very, very nice cast of characters. The ones that need to be developed are developed (very nicely) and the ones that don't need to be developed aren't developed (certain comic relief characters), and that's just the way it should be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend you give Gosick a try, provided you aren't under the assumption that it's a mystery/detective show, which it certainly is not. The pre-WWII setting does this anime a lot of favors and makes for a compelling atmosphere. With an epic plot that is definitely worth the wait for it pick up, an awesome cast of characters, and some above average animation/voice-acting, Gosick has something for just about everyone.\\n",

            "content": "The fragments of chaos are all lined up...\r\nI'll reconstruct them for you here into a review...\r\nI'll take the fragments from the chaos of this world...\r\nAnd I will reconstruct them into truth using the wellspring of wisdom within me...\r\nStory: 10\r\nGosick stars Kazaya Kujo, a Japanese exchange student in the fictional European country of Sauville.  During his stay in Sauville, he meets up with the other main character, Victorique, a small girl with long blonde hair and dresses in lolita clothing, and solve mysteries together.  Throughout the series, as each mystery is solved, more questions on the past, and the family relating to Victorique areraised.  These questions are the driving force for the latter half of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was amazing.  What seemed like pointless arcs in the beginning all tied together seamlessly in the last two episodes.  The last two episodes were filled with so much suspense, so much emotion, the series has one of the best if not the best ending to any mystery genre series. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the mystery genre and the reason why most people stop watching Scooby Doo is that the mysteries are repetitive and boring as they do more and more of.  Sherlock Holmes does a great job of not being repetitive when it deals with mystery because the characters, mainly Watson, are very interesting and keep the mystery solving exciting.  Gosick does the same deal, as the characters allow the mystery to be more interesting rather than a rinse, wash, repeat process.  \\n\\n\r\nThe romance in the anime, was rather slow in the beginning.  I couldn't even see the two characters becoming a couple, but as the series progresses, we got to see a great change in character for both of the main characters.  This will be discussed in more detail in the character section.  \\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the story was executed well.  The story takes place during the 1920s in a land that is transitioning use to electricity.  We see candles, we see lightbulbs.  We see trains and planes, we see carriages pulled by horse.  These contrasting things pull off an effect of a unique setting that very few people give much thought too.  The ending does a great job with the setting, as it pulls up true history and applies it very well to the story.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nGosick scenery wise was fine, nothing too outstanding in the scenery department.  The art stands out more in the character designs and specifically, Victorique.  The dresses that Victorique had were jaw dropping.  They were so pretty and well drawn, each lace, each fluff, everything.  Seeing the first dress was impressive, but seeing the other dresses were just amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nSomething that caught me by surprise were the action scenes.  I was not really expecting those action scenes, but they were executed really well.  The right amount of use for transition scenes that caused a clear understanding of what was actually happening during the action.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OP, Destin Histoire, was a great song that reflects the pacing of the anime.  With a very calm beginning, the series starts off calm, with mysteries that involve others and not the main characters.  The song will pick up much as the mysteries and suspense do in the series.  The first ED, Resuscitated Hope, didn't really fit in with the series, but was still a fine song.  A calm beginning but a bit too hard for what the series had in mind.  The second and last ED, unity, was a great ending and the type of ending I was expecting to have in the first place.  I would suggest them to have used \"unity\" as the sole ED rather than using two different songs...\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was fine, no complaints.  Helped carry the mood of emotion or added suspense when it was needed.  Nothing too outstanding for the background music sadly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAs I have said before, the characters had to be interesting to keep the viewers entertained during the mystery solving.  Victorique and Kujo do a great job at keeping the viewer entertained as their little squabbles, Victorique's attitude of \"I'm better than you\" crumbles to a very cute innocent girl, Kujo's slight stubbornness but I will do it anyway... These characters are very likable and enjoyable to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was amazing, as Victorique was a character who never experienced love and Kujo was a character who needed confidence, these two characters built off each other in a symbiotic relationship that is very endearing to the viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10+\\n\r\nWatching these characters interact with each other during the mystery and outside of the mystery was one of the most enjoyable things about this series.  The suspense this anime can deliver is nothing short of amazing.  This series is addictive and does a great job at keeping the viewers attention.  \\n\\n\r\nThe most enjoyable part was the ending.  I have explained why I found this enjoyable in the story section... but it needs to be explained twice!  That is how enjoyable it was.  The flawless execution of suspense and emotion during the last two episodes were down right amazing.  Nothing could have stopped me or cause my eyes to drift away from the laptop screen during those last two episodes.    \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI was expecting just a cute story... something similar to Hyouka where they solve mysteries and through the mysteries, the two main characters get together.  This anime showed me something I wasn't expecting, true chemistry between the two main characters, a true connection that can be felt outside of solving a mystery.  Gosick has earned a spot in one of my most favorite anime series.  \\n\\n\r\nThat ending was so goooooooooood.\\n",

            "content": "I guess that you want to watch some mystery/detective anime, cool.\r\nreading this review means that you want to watch GOSICK.\r\nWELL DON'T!\r\non MAL this anime scores 8.29 at this moment, seriously WTF people?!\r\nnow let's start my first review on MAL, this review is a hate review because I watched this piece of **** just because it got such high scores.\r\nfirst let's talk about the STORY 2/10: the story is set somewhere in the mid 1920s, and it's about... solving some mysteries that involve ghosts/paranormal shit at first sight. the first 3 episodes where actually quite promising. after that the anime went donwhill at the speed oflight.\\n\r\n at the end of 90% of the mysteries the main girl solves everything by pulling the answers out of her ass (pipe)! no, seriously 80% of everything she says makes absolutely no sense! you have no idea from where did she get to that conclusion. I can't really say anything more about the story without spoiling something so let's get to the \\n\\n\r\nART 8/10: gosick had some really fine art, actually this is one of the rare elements that I liked in gosick! yay\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 3/10: I'm sorry did anyone notice anything good about this category? I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS/RELATIONSHIPS 2/10: now this is the most important part in an anime (for me at least), I've rarely seen such a horrible cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nVICTORIQUE: no, her name is Victorica, but the japanese people pronounce Victorique-Victorica apparently. I know of their engrish habit but imo they could at least learn the f-ing name of the main character. Victorique isn't pronounced Victorica nor in french nor in german ffs. (nor in any other language that I know btw)\\n\r\nShe is a sweet(not) girl that spends most of her time reading in the botanical garden situated at the top floor of the library tower. Right here we got such an original plot : blonde girl imprisoned at the top level of a tower, waiting for her prince.\\n\r\nNow she is the worst loli tsundere I've ever seen, I just hate everything related to this character! As mentioned before she solves most of the mysteries without using her brain, she apparently has some wellspring of wisdom or whatever inside of her. aka => you won't see any mystery being solved in a logical way (except the first one and some not important side mysteries) most of the times she will appear at the end of the episode saying that she has every piece of the CHAOS and she can put everything together to solve the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nKUJO: ahh the male protagonist, you expect something good at least in the male protagonist. Well I'm sorry I'll destroy your illusions! He is just your typical male character that you'll find in every second anime that you'll watch. He apparently loves SM, why am I saying this? because he just loves to get his ass kicked by Victorica (YES she is called Victorica by the other characters in the anime so I'll call her the same way!). I'm serious, he gets all mad at Victorica at least once/episode because SHE IS a bitch, give him 2-3 minutes and he'll run back to her treating her to some sweets.\\n\\n\r\nnow their RELATIONSHIP: again WTF? in ep 4 or 5 I can't remember exactly they are at some \"fortune teller\" and both of them ask him: how long will they be together?\\n\r\nwhoah whoah whoah, WHAT?! trust me, in the beginning (aprox 10 episodes) they hardly know anything about each other the development in their relationship advances too fast.\\n\r\n\"Ohh cool, so we have some romance?\" who are you kidding? there is absolutely NO romance in this anime. The romance is just somewhat suggested.\\n\r\n I tried as much as I could not to spoil anything in this section while still highlighting the most important parts imo.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the rare parts that I liked in Gosick is actually the story of Victorica's mother! yes, an anime based on her mother would have been a lot better imo.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all this anime is probably the most overrated show that there is on MAL atm imo.\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a good mystery anime turn around and search some more! this is just a waste of time.\\n\r\nI could argument my points a lot better but sadly I would spoil a lot of things by doing so.\\n\r\nAll in all this is the worst mystery/romance anime that I've seen in my life up to this point.",

            "content": "\" Years from now, a gale strong enough to shake the world will blow. Your bodies are light, the gale will surely separate the two of you. However, you hearts will never be apart. \"\r\nGosick is a story of an adventure, romance and mystery of so-called ' Golden-haired princess ' and the ' Reaper that comes in spring '. The princess is a short girl with dark past, short-tempered, like sweets, smart yet unable to express her true feelings. The reaper is the third son of an imperial soldier, a bit reckless, always complain about the princess' actions and yet, is very fond of her.\r\nAta first glance, the story appears to portray the debunk of the mysteries and revealing the truth behind it, connecting the dots to a final big reveal. \\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries, also known as ghost stories because of its authenticity and seems to be impossible to solve or even understand it is overcame by these two unlikely partners, tackling each cases as it comes. Compared to other detectives anime, reconstructing the chaos while biting a blue pipe is what makes the princess special and adorable with all her emotions, sarcastic comments and her unique personality. Moreover, the side characters are well defined, each with their own quirks which makes the story much more interesting. I'd also like to compliment on the theme songs, especially one of the endings, ' Resuscitated Hope ' which strikes right into the feels and managed to cover for the main characters as well as the story. \\n\\n\r\nThese are the surface plot which might interest you but there's more to it. \\n\r\nWhat interested me the most is the lovely and realistic interaction between the princess and the reaper. When he said something that he shouldn't have, she would kick him in the leg mercilessly and he would cry out in pain. When she angered him, he would leave her with stomping foots, only to return regretfully with more sweets later. Whenever they are separated, both can't stop thinking about each other and how their wish to meet again can turn into tears.\\n\\n\r\nThey both long for each other's company and always managed to spend time together, cherishing every moments because they know that deep inside they will be separated eventually, and the only things that will be left behind are a pendant and a ring, the very symbol of love and memory. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for an anime that combines romance, mystery and adventure and a quite complicated detective story with a twist, this is it. Join them both and discover their story and see for yourself, their beautiful journey into the unknown and the promise that bonds them together.\\n\\n\r\nWill they live happily ever after? You'll have to see for it yourself.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gosick, the anime that enveloped me in a classic Sherlock Holmes and his dear Watson tale of mystery. We are familiar with the story of Sherlock Holmes and his famous mystery solving skills and Watson who is dragged around by Holmes and questions his methods as they are unbelievably insightful. In Gosick we have Kujo Kazuya, a boy descended from a soldier from which he inherited all the traits that make up a man. Kujo transfers into St. Marguerite Academy where he eventually stumbles into Victorique De Blois and this is where this Sherlock Holmes story begins as they solve mysteries and cases involving thepolice.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Art, Gosick captured the essence of the Victorian period. Being set in the mid 1920's, Gosick's art style floored me as every line was round and smooth. Backgrounds consisted of wide open ranges during times of travel, the school, and markets and neighboring towns which were very detailed as well as grabbing the commotion of a developing city.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music fit every scene accurately and further emphasize the situation especially in times of great importance. The only downside to the sound is the sound of Kujo calling out to Victorique casually as it started to annoy me; however in times of great distress him yelling out her name makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters interacted very well as there were few things that were forced by the characters. Most decisions they made were very believable considering their personalities. Although, Kujo's character is a bit off from the normal male character as he does reveal some femininity in his conversations with Victorique which was a bit much for my taste, as well as the staggering difference in the maturity of Victoriques voice and her appearance.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Gosick to the fullest each of the five times I have watched it because I wanted to be able to connect the dots that lead Victorique to her verdict. No other mystery anime was able to engross me into their mysteries as well as Gosick did. I especially enjoyed the nicknames the characters were given as they held great meaning and impact once the secrets behind those nicknames were revealed which always manages to pique my interest with every watch. As well as the red thread of fate that ties certain cases together to create a more immersive mystery.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gosick is a must for anyone interested in a Victorian themed anime.",

            "content": "When I started watching this, I had no idea what to expect.  The title seemed a bit strange, and as of yet I don't know how the name \"Gosick\" applies to the story.  Anyway....\r\nSet in the 1920's, the Great World War has just finished, and the fictional European country of Sauville is doing fairly well.  A Japanese boy, Kujo, was sent to study at an elite school there.  He wanders in a library one day, and meets a strange girl with golden hair.  But she is probably unlike any other girl he has met.  Victorique has poor social skills,complains of constant boredom, and amuses herself with solving mysteries, \u00e0 la Sherlock Holmes.  Pipe included.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as it compares to other animes, the closest similarities would be Rozen Maiden, and Black Butler.  The two main characters are reminiscent of the imperious Shinku and the \"serving-boy\" Jun of Rozen Maiden.  But the rich, gothic, historical setting, tension, and semi-horror are similar to Black Butler.\\n\\n\r\nSo strictly speaking, it doesn't feel highly original.  But it is still very enjoyable so far.  \\n\\n\r\nWe get a mix of the occult, murder mystery, a (likely) tsundere girl, annoying professional detective, mousey schoolteachers....\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is quite rich and lovely.  The settings, whether luxurious rooms, conservatories, or bare police offices, are all excellent.  What fistfights we've seen so far are well done, and visceral.  The opening sequence is done in beautiful art-nouveau style.  Apparently, this series was based straight off a novel, which perhaps allowed the anime creators to be more free in the settings and art, and not limited to the visuals provided by a manga.  The sound and music are also quite good.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't give the show a rating until I saw the third episode.  I think it has a lot of potential.  If it can maintain the level of story it has so far, and if it can expand on the characters, I think this will be a very excellent show this season.",

            "content": "Are you looking for a subpar mystery anime where the main character manages to solve the mystery without much rhyme or reason, done so in a fashion that is nothing like Death Note, Sherlock Holmes, or any other mystery medium where the viewer tries to solve the puzzle as the anime moves along? Are you looking for a detective character with god-like deductive powers not acquired through hard work or training? Are you looking for the blandest lead male character that has little character development throughout the series, and gets obnoxiously annoying as he constantly screams the female lead's name? Are you looking for amediocre romance that concludes in a happy ending? Look no further! This is the anime for you!\\n\\n\r\nFor a deeper in-depth review, read further. Be warned, there are spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nMystery. To start, the mystery is horrible. I picked this anime up hoping to find a nice mystery anime. Technically it is a mystery anime. But it's executed in such a fashion that it doesn't at all feel like a mystery anime. When you watch a movie like Se7en, you're really engaged because you really want to know who did it. When you watch Sherlock Holmes, you find yourself drawn i, despite the fact that you know the bad guy is Moriarty, because you want to know how Sherlock solves the challenges thrown at him. Gosick offers none of these. Any plot twists it \"purports\" to have is easily deduced. I could see who the villain was coming a mile away. Everything was so blatantly obvious. Granted, I didn't always see how the \"villain\" executed his or her plan, but that's because Gosick doesn't offer clues here or there. The main female character jumps in like 10-15 minutes before the episode ends, spoon feeds you the solution, without really explaining how she managed to deduce such a solution, using clues that seem nonexistent or clearly bullshit (please see motorcycle incident with blood girl for an example). I guess my biggest grip is yes, technically, Gosick does offer these elements. It just executes it in such a poor fashion it's like you're NOT watching a mystery anime.\\n\\n\r\nMale Lead Character. This guy is annoying, horrible, does not grow at all, and is as flat as a cardboard. By the end of the show you'll want to punch him in the face. He incessantly screams out the female lead's name to the point where it's like the creators are purposefully trying to tick you off. He's also very unrealistic. I understand he's like around the age of 18, a high schooler, but are you really to expect us to believe that he doesn't know what love, or at the very least, what liking someone is? He constantly refers to the female lead as his \"friend\" and justifies why he does what he does because she's his friend. Except he has other friends, and he doesn't risk his life for them. Either make it so he's all shy and can't confront his feelings, or make it so that he acknowledges it but he can't confess to her, and or make it so that he knows he likes her and he tells her about it. None of this \"I totally risk my life for you, I think about you all the time, I love hanging out with you, and there's obviously chemistry between us, but we're totally just friends.\"\\n\\n\r\nFemale Lead Character. She's mediocre. To say she's bad would be a slight overstatement. My biggest gripe with her is her \"deductive\" abilities, but I think that's more a flaw of the plot and story than the character herself. She does show growth, and she is cute. But that's about it. \\n\\n\r\nMusic. Didn't really stand out, and not even in a way where the music is so good it allows you to really sink into the anime, not realizing you're watching an anime. Long story short, the music is average. It's like elevator music that you don't enjoy, but don't hate.\\n\\n\r\nThat Guy with the Pointy Hair. A slightly below average character. His change is gradual, and you start to see it, but then it's like the creators realized they only have 5 episodes left, so they put his character growth in overdrive and suddenly he's changed too much, too quickly. I see where they were going with him, and I appreciate it, but they executed it in a poor fashion. Either initiate the change earlier, spread the pace of the change so its slightly quickened across the show, or make the season longer. His change came too quickly, too abruptly, and you know it all happened because the show was ending soon and they needed his character to perform some task for the show to end the way it ended.\\n\\n\r\nThat Really Annoying High School Teacher. The high school teacher is 110% extra and useless. I understand she's comic relief, and sometimes we include comic relief characters that really don't offer anything. They don't move the plot forward, they don't stimulate character growth, they really don't do anything but offer the occasional laugh. And while that isn't ideal, that's okay and still acceptable. But the high school teacher wasn't funny. She never was. She was actually annoying. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters. Everyone else was okay, but no one stood out. Gun to my head, the short haired blonde girl was the best character. But even she had a flaw, namely that it was implicated that she was the perpetrator of a certain murder, except the show never followed up on that, and just pretended like it never happened. It's one thing to find out she wasn't the murderer, and that all the signs were just a coincidence. It's another thing to drop the matter entirely like it never happened. Either don't give signs implying she's the murderer, or at least conclude the matter. \\n\\n\r\nEnding. The ending was overly dramatic and quite bad. The whole point of the prophecy was that... get ready for it... it's a prophecy of the future, an inevitable fate that cannot be avoided without some significant fight-back. But nope, they just drop the prophecy like it's nothing, and then prove it wrong with little to no effort. You can tell they threw the ending in just because they wanted to end the season on a dramatic and epic note. Except it felt quite out of place. The ending wasn't that bad (except it was executed poorly), it's just that it came too quickly. Once again, it's as if the creators realized they only had 3 episodes left to conclude the show, and thus put everything into hyper drive. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict. Unless you've depleted all other mystery/romance anime, I don't see why you would ever want to pick this up. It's a mediocre anime flirting on the skirts of \"bad anime.\"",

            "content": "Gosick is a strange ''mystery'' series that is based in a series of light novels! It's from studio Bones (that also gave as Fullmetal Alchemist) and it may not be its most ambitious work, but it is definitely its most ''out of the ordinary'', since while is supposed to be a ''mystery'' series, it combines with it elements of romance (mostly about the strange relationship between the two protagonists), alongside with elements of war/politics, as well as ''Pseudo-History'' (that shows what could had happened if the Nazis had ever been involved with the occult - as Bones had first shown in the movie ''Fullmetal Alchemist:The Conqueror of Shamballa'')!\\n\r\nThe series has as a common theme mysteries that they look like there is something ''supernatural'' behind them, but the young ''detective'' girl protagonist always proves that there is a logical explanation on everything!\\n\r\nNow, some people are complaining that the male protagonist isn't evolved properly as a character, but that isn't true! Whenever he has to handle a situation alone, he proves that even if he is kind of naive, he is quite skillful!\\n\r\nBut the real ''star'' of the series, is the female protagonist, that she is not just a know-it-all ''loli'', but a smart and brave girl, which although she looks cold and distant, she just looking for someone who understands her, and for a chance to break her isolation and to learn about the outside world! The mystery of her origins, as well as the question of what is it that some powerful people want from her, it's the basis of the whole series!\\n\r\nNow, the series on the last episodes goes completely ''out of its way'', when it changes from a ''mystery'' series into a... ''romance adventure'', but in reality it is then that it becomes more interesting... and the ending it's quite touching!\\n\r\nOverall, the series may not been a ''masterpiece'', but it's still great, moving and enjoyable, and it is highly recommended, if you like both mystery and romance/historical adventures, and if you are looking for something more ''unique''!",

            "content": "Come one come all, Lion Tamers; we start again!\r\nGosick, for some, is a play on words like Gothic. But if you translate it from the Japanese, you get \"Five Fingers C K\". What that might mean, to anyone other than a person who speaks the language, has to be obscure.\r\nBut epically gothic, Gosick IS!\r\nForgive the strong language, but I have just completed Gosick for the first time. The wellspring of emotions connected with this tale of 24 episodes, which leads to the finale; can only be described in such terms.\r\nGosick is a story of many threads; all leading to tragedy, mysteries solved, mysteries left unsolved,love lost, and then found; of friendship that transcends tragedy that marks the heart forever, to betrayal and sins most foul; and finally to an end that leaves only the lovelorn alive, and unrequited love finally at ease.\\n\\n\r\nThe story\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nBeginning in the spring of 1924, the story opens with a very chance meeting of a Japanese exchange student (named Kujo) who finds himself in a boarding school in a country named Sauville; with a tiny girl (named Victorique) who reads all the time and mistreats Kujo beyond all imagining.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't read Charles Dickens, you won't see the obvious character match with Pip and Estella from \"Great Expectations\". The book has been immortalized on film several times, so don't miss it. Gosick begins exactly the same as Great Expectations; and tragically ends, much the same way.\\n\\n\r\nIn the course of the anime, the threads begin with the solving of a number of serious and tragic mysteries, each one playing on the next, each one supporting many of the players (past and present); eventually leading to a triumph of spirit that ends in a mothers' love conquering all. And a daughter that finally can know peace.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this in a backdrop of the coming of World War II, in a small Baltic country on the edge of increasingly Nazi Germany. Included in this tale, is the intertwined legends and myths normally reserved for Gypsies and Fakers and red-noire monster movies. Much of which were actually believed in by the people of the region, and some still do.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, Victorique continues to grow into an almost 'Sherlock Holmes'esque character, who eventually becomes so important that her deductions of \"crimes most foul\" threaten the entire government of Sauville. Classically cleaver, the story progresses to 1929, with Sauville in tatters and ruins, and Kujo coming back from war, to his Japanese home, to the last of his family waiting for him. His mother, and a disguised little platinum blonde girl; Victorique finds herself in Japan. All those years of suspense, tragedy and terror; had finally left Victorique, and she could finally live her life, with her one true friend.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nI'm going to be general here, as the long list of important characters would leave this review a novel. Suffice to say, the characters, main, support, and accessory; are all three dimensional, all have their own lives and dreams, and ultimately every single one haunts the viewer for days after completing the series that is Gosick.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nAs some of you might recall, I am a big fan of anime music. I was NOT disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening theme feels strangely European in its' rock-and-roll flair, and the lyrics are absolutely on point.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two End-Title theme songs, and both are perfect for their purpose. The first ends at episode 13, and is lighter than the second; which supports the lighter part of the early series. The second End-Title theme, while quite different, is somewhat more a European Folk-song, and is melodramatic enough to fit very well with the latter half of Gosick.\\n\\n\r\nThe singing voices are actually as beautiful as the anime of Gosick; especially the end-title theme voices.\\n\\n\r\nThe intermediate scenic music and thematic soundtrack is as theatric as any soundtrack music in any anime. This is especially true of the scenes requiring suspense-filled animus. Outstanding at every single scene.\\n\\n\r\nVoices\\n\r\n-------\\n\r\nI am aware that there is a dub version of this anime, but I don't think any dub could possibly fit the mood and enormous charm of this anime. You have to listen to this voicing in the Japanese, and for us English speaking folks, tolerate the sub-English. The voices are THAT good.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork\\n\r\n-------\\n\r\nI was very impressed with the artwork. As some reviewers have properly reported; the artwork, while not standout, is subtly drawn, with tender nuance. The scenic and visual aspects look like real places in Europe, and the people are drawn with realistic actions. I found it quite charming to see the emotions playing across the faces of many of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening credits use a backdrop of many of the story characters and scenes drawn as 'stain-glass\" pictures. Achingly beautiful in every way.\\n\\n\r\nThe end-title sequence always leaves you with views of characters; that leave the viewer with a longing to help the characters and to help save them from the terrors that are to come.\\n\\n\r\nEnd Comments\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nGosick leaves the viewer knowing the end of the story, in significantly more detail than the characters. The stark realism of tragic terror, the outrage of the deeds done upon what amounts to the innocent, and the never ending ironies which interconnect every single detail in artistic splender; is an absolute triumph in the Anime Genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire production is simply the most beautiful Anime I have ever seen. The story, characters, artwork, music and voices; all come together in a cohesive whole.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several Anime that can match Gosick, but none can exceed it. Gosick gets my whole-hearted and warmest recommendation, and I place an enthusiastic 10 upon the best anime I've seen in 2014.",

            "content": "Based on a series of light novels by Japanese author Kazuki Sakuraba, the anime version of Gosick is one of the many 24-26 episode series which seem to only have enough plot for 16-18 episodes and so stretch things out by filling early episodes with 1-2 episode missions (or mysteries in this case) which bear little or no connection to the overall plot and mostly just reinforce the flavor of the content. Typically such series start getting serious about the bigger picture in the late single digit or early double digit episode counts and improve considerably in storytelling quality once they do, and Gosick followsthat pattern, too. Whatever impression you may make about the quality of its story based on the first few episodes will likely change as the series progresses, as this is a better series in its last two-thirds than it is early on.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic structure of the early episodes \u2013 and, indeed, much of the series \u2013 is essentially a Goth loli version of Detective Conan flavored with tsundere trappings. Some kind of difficult, elaborate mystery comes up which Kazuya brings to Victorique's attention and over the course of an episode or two she assembles the \u201cfragments of chaos\u201d Sherlock Holmes-style (she even uses a pipe!) and explains the truth for Grevil and Kazuya, the former of which takes the public credit for it. Starting with episode 6, though, the mysteries also start feeding into the overall plot involving the Marquis de Blois' efforts to use Victorique as a tool for a power grab, although that will only be apparent upon later reflection. From that point on the series slowly but steadily builds a twisted plot involving political scheming, dark secrets, illusionists, masked alchemists, midget mothers (let's just say that it is not a coincidence that Victorique only stands 4' 7\u201d), a story about a slain Queen, and local legends brought to life, all laced with a high degree of subterfuge and brought to a head in an initiation of World War II that comes more than a decade early in this alternate world. Certainly the content has no shortage of drama and intensity, and while some of the schemes are a bit silly, only rarely does the series flirt with melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nThe story arc involving the village of the Gray Wolves, which covers episodes 6-8, is also the point where the relationship of Victorique and Kazuya cements, although Victorique's hints of vulnerability and subtle reliance on Kazuya start to show much earlier. Anime cannot serve up a diminutive, tsundere female lead without also providing a caring, tolerant, and understanding male lead as an accomplice, and Kazuya and Victorique are the classic tsundere couple in that sense. Kazuya comes off as distinctly less intelligent here than in the novels, to the point that his inability to figure things out on his own is sometimes an irritation, but he does come to understand Victorique well and the sentiment which develops between the two feels genuine; when Victorique claims, late in the series, that Kazuya is her heart, any viewer who has paid attention to her circumstances and his actions should easily understand why. Granted, Kazuya and Victorique are hardly an excitingly original couple, but the execution of their relationship is done well enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of supporting characters also proves to be typical and unexciting. Avril Bradley, a British foreign exchange student who befriends Kazuya because they are both outsiders, looks like she was intended as the competing love interest, as she provides the starkest possible contrast to Victorique for having the same hair color (her hair is short and she is vivacious and personable), but the series never offers even the slightest hint that she is gaining romantic traction with Kazuya so she is really just a hanger-on. A couple of adult ladies show up to provide spirit and comic relief but are ultimately forgettable, and the illusionist never gets much past being mysterious. Victorique's mother Cordelia is an interesting presence, and her backstory is particularly dark, but she spends too much of her time popping up randomly and also being mysterious; she only truly shines near the end of the series. In fact, the only recurring supporting character who makes much of an impression is (surprisingly) Grevil, and that is mostly because the buffoon that he seems to be early on is later shown to not be his true character; episode 11, which explains why he has the weird, drill-shaped hairdo (it is a very purposeful affectation, we discover, and not done just for flavor), should change many a viewer's opinion on him.\\n\\n\r\nThe real draw of the series, though, is the artistry, and especially the character designs. The doll-like Victorique, with her cute face, ultra-petite figure, and hair nearly as long as her body, is the epitome of Goth loli beauty; a picture of her with her pipe, sitting amongst her books, is all the advertisement that the series needs to attract viewers in, and Bones made certain to highlight her in other cute outfits, too. All of the other character designs are also clean and appealing, and background art is attractive, nicely-rendered, and tweaked appropriately for the mood of the scene, with serious moments generally being darker and more light-hearted fare generally being brighter. The series does not have much true action in it except towards the very end, so the animation rarely gets a chance to truly show off, but its merits shine in simpler moments like Victorique rolling around on the floor in boredom, her reaction to getting a shot (possibly the single most priceless tsundere moment ever), and the animation of facial expressions on assorted random characters, especially when giving horrified reactions. While the series is not especially bloody, it does have its graphic moments and occasional intense violence, enough so that any future DVD/Blu-Ray release will probably carry at least an age 14+ rating. It does not, however, have any prurient fan service.\\n\\n\r\nMusic director Nakagawa (Code Geass, Cross Game, Planetes) provides an effective and nimble score which handles both light-hearted and deathly series scenes with equal skill and knows when to be quiet, too. Opener \u201cdestine histoire\u201d is pretty but bland, while each half of the series has its own equally pretty closer; of the two, the first one, \u201cResuscitated Hope,\u201d is by far the better one, as the second closer \u201cunity\u201d sounds more forced. Amongst vocal performances, the stand-out is Aoi Y\u016bki in the lead role \u2013 and she may be perfectly-cast, as she is only slightly taller (4' 9\u201d) and slightly older (18 at the start of the series) than the character she voices. Aoi has had a string of prominent lead roles lately (Mina Tepes in Dance in the Vampire Bund, Jubei in Samurai Girls, Ichigo in Yumeiro P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, amongst others) but this is one of her best jobs; if Rie Kugimiya ever steps down as the Queen of Tsundere, she could have a successor already lined up.\\n\\n\r\nAt the time of this writing Gosick has yet to be licensed for DVD/Blu-Ray release, and thus is only currently available in streaming form on Crunchyroll. Given its merits an eventual proper American release seems inevitable, however.\\n\\n\r\nAs pure mystery series go, there are certainly stronger options out there, but none of them can match Gosick's visuals and few can equal it on the development of its central couple. The series does have its humorous moments, too, and its ending, which is somewhat open to interpretation, is anything but tame. One may have to muddle through some weak early episodes, but the late pay-off will certainly be worth it.",

            "content": "Story/Characters: 8/10 of 10\r\nThe only weakness of this anime, is the plotting of a couple of the story arcs. In many cases it seems that, as a mystery, it is a very good character based show with a good amount of humor and action mixed together. The mysteries in the first two arcs are, in general, far too easy to solve, but the story does pick up the pace after that. I believe that some of this is intentional. In particular, the first mystery is designed more to show how incompetent Grevil is rather than showing Victorique's brilliance or providing a real mystery for theviewer to sink their teeth into. The next few sections of mystery plot seem more intended to display Victorique's genius, as she solves them so quickly that the viewer doesn't really have time to ruminate about them, though they are not too hard to solve anyway. There are several plot points in the Queen Berry arc that were pleasantly surprising, and the tie in they make with real world history were deftly handled. \\n\\n\r\nThe mood of the show changes decidedly in the final half, going from more of a light hearted feel with tense moments in the final portions of a story arc to a much more intense and dark tone throughout. The real mystery, we find, is not in the individual story arcs and their petty plot points, but in the overarching story of Victorique\u2019s origin, her family, and the intrigues and mechanisms of both the villains and those who seek to help our intrepid heroine and her stalwart protector. Will a cruel world tear apart these two youngsters as it appears to be tearing itself apart, or will they persevere and find their way to a happy ending against all odds? This is where the story truly begins to shine!\\n\\n\r\nBut the story is not what this show is about! It is about Kuj\u014d and Victorique, their friendship, and the bond of trust and eventually love that develops as the story progresses. Kuj\u014d is one of the finest anime leading men to be paired with a strong tsundere leading lady in recent memory. Frankly, he is right up there with Ryuji from Toradora and Sousuke from Full Metal Panic. He is strong, loyal, brave, and surprisingly good with a pair of brass knuckles. He is willing to put himself in the path of danger in order to protect Victorique, even when he had just met her. As the story progresses, she begins to rely on him for that physical protection, but even more, Kuj\u014d becomes her emotional rock as well. Victorique is a classic tsundere, wrapped up in goth-loli packaging. But she is more than just a moe stereotype. Victorique is a fantastic character, with many sterling features including her demonstrative boredom, her sarcastic monotone laugh, her vulnerability because of her diminutive size, and her emotional fragility because of various factors in her childhood. She is a complex and well rounded character, capable of a wide range of tsun, from biting sarcasm to bald face manipulation of Kuj\u014d's tender-hearted nature, but she also has a tender side that is loyal to her Kuj\u014d and seems genuinely happy to have someone she can trust in her life. By the end, when the two have fallen in love, the tender moments between them are fantastic and when the hands of fate separate them, the pain is palpable! The way that these two characters interact and develop as the mysteries swirl around them is a joy to behold and one of the main pleasures of this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe background art for Gosick is stunning! The lush greens of the forested mountainside, the architecture of the school with its towers and old buildings, and the wonderful attention to detail in the school environment, as well as the other settings when the two are off campus, are all done with exquisite charm and impressive style. The character designs are wonderful, with Victorique's ultra cute, doll like looks and flowing hair and Kuj\u014d's attractive yet down to earth everyman look, as well as the other characters in the school and outside of it. The main problems I have with the art do stem from the characters, however. Grevil's hair is atrocious! It is supposed to be, I realize, but it is beyond silly! The fact that it is an integral plot point does not excuse it! There is also a tendency to rely on some fairly unattractive and out of place super deformed animation techniques when showing surprise, chagrin, or shock in the characters, though the blushing face of Victorique when embarrassed is one of the true joys of the show. The animation, particularly of the action scenes with Kuj\u014d and the various horror/suspense moments in the show is first rate and very smooth. The surreal war scenes of the final arc are almost \u2018Madoka\u2019 level in their bizarreness, adding another layer of artistry to the show\u2019s accomplishments. The horror aspects of the show can get pretty graphic, so be prepared and consider the age of the viewers if you tend to watch anime with your kids. (Eleven or twelve and up should be fine, but if the child is prone to nightmares or squeamish, you might want to wait until 14 or 15.)\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound Effects: 10 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe music for this show is almost always exactly the right mood at the right time with just the right intensity to enhance the story or drive it forward. At first, I was unsure about the opening theme, as it seemed a bit too much like something you would hear with an action show like Full Metal Panic, but it grows on you with repeated listening and, as my son pointed out, it fits the beginning of the anime in terms of the fact that the opening of arcs in the story are generally more light and comedic in nature, while the climax of an arc is bound to be more suspenseful and tense, which is where the ED music comes in. The end theme, \"Resuscitated Hope,\" is one of the finest anime songs I have ever heard! While in mid arc the show strives to end each episode with a mini-cliff-hanger, edge of your seat, shiver up your spine moment. When it succeeds, that sensation is amplified by the haunting, driving rhythm and minor key sensibility of this wonderful song! I get chills up my spine just listening to it, without the anime lead in! The second ED, \u201cUnity\u201dwhile not as good of a song as the first, is just as effective in evoking the mood of the show as it turns darker and the lives of our duo become more fraught with danger. It is haunting and painfully evocative of Victorique\u2019s tortured past. The animation that goes with it is extremely well done. Both of them bring shivers to my spine! The background and incidental music inside the episodes is expertly done, as one should expect of a show with a mystery/horror based theme.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 9 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the leads is wonderful, particularly Victorique. Her distinctive style of talking and the range of emotions she displays are challenging tasks that are ably met by Aoi Y\u016bki. The aforementioned monotone laugh and the tone of voice when she is massively embarrassed and about to go into full tsun mode are priceless! Kuj\u014d's voice actor also does an excellent job, displaying a good range of emotional states and a solid base from which Victorique's eccentricity can be fully appreciated. The weak point would have to be Grevil, whose voice is almost as annoying as his hair, but I expect that was intentional on the part of the director.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 10 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is one of my favorites of all time! I am unapologetically a fan of Gosick and would buy in on BluRay in an instant if Bandai had not gone and folded their home video operations after snatching up the rights. I hope that someone rescues the license, even if it is NIS America and I have to deal with not having a dubbed version. I just want to have it to watch whenever I wish in a well-minted disk. Is that too much to ask? At least it is still on Crunchyroll and I can go there and watch it anytime I please, which I have done with select episodes a few times since the show ended. If you haven't checked it out, I would suggest that you give Gosick a try!\\n",

Gosick takes place 1924 and on with the main Characters, Kujo Kuzuya and Victorique de Blois. At first you would think they will hate each other I don' t know maybe the opening shows seperation but in the end you just wish for them to be together.At first there kids to start and they Kujo x victorique show lots of love affection.\r\nStory and enjoyment 10/10:\r\nImust say from the beginning of Gosick you'll get the attention right away. I sure did really strong story that keeps you wanting more until the end (maybe).I got hooked by the couple Kujo x Victorique.The Mysteries try to solve them yourself too it's fun to be smart as Victorique.Maybe your right or wrong some mysteries will catch you off guard.Plus there's many funny parts when the main characters aren't so into the case.Also there's many in main mystery of Victorique but you must fing out what it is.\\n\r\nNOTE\\n\r\n*THERE'S BLOOD AND FIGHTS IN GOSICK*\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nYou would believe the art in Gosick so realistic,the cuteness,the hotness,the Achitecture of the places they go. The landscapes just make you wish you were there,because it looks so mesmerizing.Such great art because you can see when the characters in love,in pain,crying etc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Sound: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTrust me when I say Victorique and Kujo are cute together.My most favorite Characters and the teachers.Some characters you just wait for them to meet their demise.Overall the characters are strong faithful (especially Kujo).You will love and feel sorry for some characters.The Golden fairy ?the Dark reaper cool names for the characters just that they never answered where thay got it.For an exchange student Victorique is sure lucky to be with such a cute guy like with so faithful and sweet.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 \\n\r\nYou will fall in love or like the songs they choose for Gosick.

            "content": "Gosick is a good example of how anime can have a tiresome beginning but make an impressive comeback halfway into the series. It has less intensity compared to other mystery anime, but that doesn\u2019t make it a bypass. Despite a slow beginning for mysteries, it becomes shockingly good with legends and unsolved murder cases in the second half. However, the anime primarily has a romance-drama focus on the interracial duo Victorique and Kujo. Their adventures and relationship development make Gosick a fun anime to watch.\r\nThe execution of Victorique and Kujo\u2019s relationship makes up the entire anime. It started off rocky with Victorique being the tsundereheroine by bullying and bossing Kujo regularly, but she gradually reveals her vulnerability and innocence. Their caring and even harsh actions towards each other bring the romance-drama part of the anime at full bloom. As the understanding male lead, Kujo cares for Victorique by providing her with presents and sweets and being her protector. Both MCs positively change the other. Kujo teaches Victorique to be kinder and more open to people, and Kujo\u2019s logic skills improved as he assisted Victorique with mysteries. As they solve countless mysteries and spend time together, this exciting duo strongly becomes inseparable. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of mystery, Gosick can appear kind of silly and boring in the beginning. The mysteries are too simplistic or ridiculous. The pattern is repetitive with Victorique being bored and demanding Kujo to find a mystery for her to solve in 2-3 episodes. As the plot advances, mysteries of past legends at the academy and old murder cases within the royal family make Gosick unforgettable. Cases become connected, and secrets were revealed at long last. Victorique\u2019s background itself is a mystery and takes over the entire plot. It is slightly introduced in the first half, and the drama start to escalate in the second half with a strong emphasis on Victorique\u2019s family. The ending was straightforward and very satisfying. The only problem is that it can be confusing for those unfamiliar with certain historical facts.\\n\\n\r\nAs the Goth loli version of Sherlock Holmes, Victorique alone livens this show with her intelligence, sarcasm, and tsundere attitude. It seemed ridiculous earlier in the series when she would solve a case before all evidence was present. Some of her conclusions seemed like mere guesses because of a special gift she calls the \u201cwellspring of wisdom.\u201d Theoretically, this comes from spending years reading countless books in various subjects. As mysteries became more interesting, her conclusions were cleverer with scientific facts, observations, etc. Apart from her detective skills, her girly side is adorable. Her actions can be unthinkable as she has first-time experiences and expresses various emotions (excitement, sensitivity, etc.). Victorique\u2019s personality altogether makes her a memorable tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nThe irritation of the series comes from the supporting characters. They do not hold any special significance to them besides progressing the plot and bringing light humor. The clumsy teacher Cecile truly cares for her students, but she hardly acts realistically in dangerous situations. Even though there is a reason behind it, it is hard to take Gosick seriously when there is a so-called detective named Grevil with a hairstyle resembling soft-serve ice cream and who takes public credit for cases that Victorique solved. Despite being a sorry excuse for a detective, his character suddenly changes from goofy to serious within the series. There are a few likeable ones like Victorique's mom. The supporting characters play a part in the MCs\u2019 lives, but they do not have any personalities of their own. \\n\\n\r\nBones did an excellent job portraying 20th-century European society with the modern backgrounds, transportation, and clothing in their animation. Victorique\u2019s character design is the most impressive with her petite figure, long blonde hair, and lacy dresses with matching bonnets. Kujo\u2019s design fit the script for the sole Oriental character. Some of the characters\u2019 emotions, especially Victorique\u2019s embarrassment, were genuine, but a few others did not match the intensity of some scenes. The settings were impressive and the colors distinguished from the gloomy and vivid parts. Gray and dull colors applied to war or murder scenes. The most vivid setting has to be the colorful garden and beautiful pieces of art on the library\u2019s top floor. The only problem were stills in the animation, sometimes with the movement of only one or two characters.\\n\\n\r\nGosick has a beautiful soundtrack, consisting of mostly J-pop ballads as the OP and two EDs. The OP is good, but it hinted nearly the entire series. I love Lisa Komine as a vocalist for both the EDs. The first ED is upbeat and one of my personal favorites. The second ED sounded too slow for the excitement that occurred in the second half. On the plus side, the lyrics fully describe the romance between Victorique and Kujo. The seiyuu did a great job as well. Yuuki Aoi\u2019s voice represented Victorique\u2019s tsundere personality perfectly, giving a mature womanly tone and a soft girly tone in appropriate situations.\\n\\n\r\nI went into Gosick solely expecting mystery, so I was disappointed and bored in the beginning. It was not until midway when I became hooked, because the mysteries became a lot more interesting with historical fiction and legends. I also began to appreciate the bond between Victorique and Kujo as I learned the true objective of Gosick. I loved the ending so much that I plan to read Gosick\u2019s sequel novel, Gosick RED.\\n\\n\r\nGosick should not be approached completely as a mystery anime. Otherwise, you may feel inclined to drop a remarkable story. It has a slow start, but it boosts in the second half. The historical fiction aspect of the show is incredible as secrets are revealed and drama escalates. It has a properly executed relationship of the main couple, making them a memorable duo. Even though it may start off disappointedly, Gosick is certainly worth giving a chance.",

            "content": "In compliance with the suggestions from a friend, I decided to watch Gosick. I had initially passed over this series when I first came upon it, not thinking that it was too special, but boy was I wrong. Gosick weaves an intricate and touching story of Kujo, a foreign exchange student from Japan, and Victorique, the child of an influential person in the government of Saubure. Truthfully, I really did start the series with a pretty low expectation, since I'm not exactly a fan of mystery in general. However, the story and the progression of the plot in Gosick goes far beyond an average mysterystory. \\n\\n\r\nEvaluation:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I stated before, Gosick tells of an extremely touching tale of these two students as they face the troubles of Post-World War One Europe. It goes deeper to reveal darker and more intimate parts of the past from various characters, and from there, the motives behind the actions of Victorique's father later on in the series. The anime is not exactly fast paced, but has twists and turns that will leave you breathless, and numerous cliffhangers that will have you on the edge of your seat, begging for the next part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nAs for the art, I thought it was pretty good. Definitely not the best art I've seen, but it's also more than decent. Vivid colors, along with a mixture of black and white augments some of the scenes beautifully, and the landscape was just simply stunning at points. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nHere is where I start being a little nit-picky. I'm a real sticker for music, and good music appeals to me just as much as the other aspects of the anime. Yes, I admit that the music was pretty good, but, I don't know, I just felt like there wasn't enough of it. Gosick did have some good music in some scenes, but I would have liked maybe some calming/tranquil music in a few places. Other than that, there really isn't too much else to be critical of. Maybe I'm a tad too harsh here...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nJust, wow. I loved the characters and the way the anime managed to tell of their pasts and inner feelings. But what really made this anime so good for me was, without a doubt, Victorique. Facial expressions? Priceless. Oh, and the fact that she seems to be one of the few characters who isn't completely ignorant of blatantly obvious facts made it sweeter.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI have to say. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, with all of its little plot twists and the various mysteries Victorique and Kujo had to solve. As I mentioned above, I'm not a big fan of mysteries, but this is one of the few animes/books/movies that I actually managed to enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I thought that Gosick was an amazing piece of work. The depth in which it probes into the past of characters, as well as a clever use of European History was, in my opinion, what made this anime such a masterpiece. There are sad parts to it, but don't worry. It's not exactly sad enough to make you cry, but it should be enough that, at the end, you will have finished watching a dramatic, but heartwarming tale of Kujo and Victorique.",

            "content": "Gosick was a show that came up on my recommendations after watching Spice & Wolf. I\u2019d never seen a murder mystery anime before so it was a new experience. The story revolves around a mysterious girl called Victorique who spends much of her time shut up in a library at Saint Margueite Academy in the fictional country of Sauville. Kujo is a Japanese exchange student who one day while searching the library, meets Victorique and their adventure begin\r\nVictorique is extremely intelligent and uses her \u2018wellspring of wisdom\u2019 to solve cases as the story progresses. Its easy to see where the influences for her character comefrom most notably Sherlock Homes (she even has a fake pipe). Kujo is\u2019nt as stupid as we a made to believe but he\u2019s certainly naive and in early episode Victorique walks all over him.\\n\\n\r\nGosick has several story arcs which take place before the bigger story arc starts around half way through the series. Its clever how side stories link in with the main story arc in particular the Alchemist arc which is plays an important part in explaining why Victorique is shut up in the tower.  The story has some dark undertones especially when dealing with Victorique mother & father but this is balanced out by the growing relationship between Kujo & Victorique.\\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship grows as the series progresses and Kujo becomes less of a doormat and Victorique becomes more human. She is portrayed as cold and calculating by  others but she is really a victim of her father\u2019s desires. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to give too much away about the story which is smart and engaging. The side characters are not particularly interesting but it doesn\u2019t matter as your focus is on the growing relationship between the main characters. The art style is stunning and its easy to see how Victoriques design influenced Studio Bones Chaika. The sound is ok though I\u2019m not a fan of the Eurovision-esque closing song for the second part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe series moves faster in the final episodes and brings elements of the story together for a great worthy climax. I would have been nice to see more of Kujo and Victorique at the end but at least its conclusive and generally satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the motives of the criminals are questionable the story still holds your attention due to the strength of the main characters.  Gosick is very enjoyable and is a must for any fan of mystery and romance. It\u2019s a shame Bandai pulled out of DVD publishing before this series got released as it\u2019s a real gem of a show. I hope one day someone picks this up for release as it\u2019s too good to be forgotten. \\n",

            "content": "Ah so the time has come for a review for this beutiful yet terrifying anime.\r\nWhen you're looking for a masterpiece disguised as an anime, you may want to check Gosick out. \r\nI was very sceptical at the first episode, but I guess the first episode of most animes is just so you will get to \"know\" the anime and the main character/s.\r\nI thought it was boring and yet another tsundere girl and a crybaby as the male MC, but after I kept watching things got interesting fast.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThis anime doesn't really have 1 story where the anime goes from A in the first episode toB in the last episode, it's packed with mysteries and adventures which make this anime really great where you can follow the MC's and really getting this feeling of bonding. Now my english isn't the best but each episode is a sequel to the previous episode, so it's the same story the anime through but they're not trying to solve the same mystery in every episode. At first the anime is this way, but later in the anime you do get this \"damn it can't end like this! I need to see the next episode\" feeling. TL;DR: The first episodes have a good end so they can start with a new adventure next episode and the later episodes don't really have a \"end\" except for the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9\\n\r\nNow this anime is really beautifully animated where things in the background is moving when you get a close up to the characters as they speak, the only reason why I didn't give this a 10 is because of the mouth movements, it was nothing to complain about really but it wasn't perfect. The art itself was really good, they really knew how to draw light in this anime for example. The best art you can get IMO is animes like Strike the Blood and Toaru Kagaku no Railgun/Index, those animes are a 10, this was a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening song was really fitting for this anime and I actually saw the whole OP in some episodes. The ending song for the first half of the anime was one of the best I've heard in any anime. The reason I gave this a 9 and not 10 was because they changed it to another not as good song the later half (episodes 13-24). The songs in the background, sound effects and voices were all good and I've nothing to complain about there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI freaking loved Victorique! She is one of my favorite characters of all time. She is cute, says what she wants, do what she wants (except for breaking one sertain rule) and is super intelligent. She can solve any mystery and is the best detective there is, much like L in Death Note.\\n\r\nThe other MC Kujou was a bit annoying when he would scream VICTORIQUE over and over but besides that he really became a man so to say throught the series, he isn't afraid to \"sacrifice\" himself for Victorique and he is always, always involved in mysteries/deaths. His nickname \"The Black Reaper\" is very fitting even tho he isn't the one who kill the persons around him, he is just there at the wrong time. All his classmates is afraid of him too (except for 2 where one is Victorique, but she never attends classes).\\n\r\nThe teacher is really amusing as well as many other characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI will try too keep this short. I couldn't stop watching, and I had a hard time to sleep because I still had more episodes to watch (took me 2 days to finish this so). Every episode except the first one was so exciting. And how can Victorique solve every little thing? How is she going the solve this? And her explanations is always on spot, I feel so dumb when listening to her, which I really like in animes, where I don't understand everything before hand.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI love mystery animes. I love unique characters. I love animes who isn't \"afraid\" of showing deaths and some blood (and not being a gore anime). I love good fittting OP's. I love good animation and art. I love a good plot. And I absolutely love a good romance story. Even though I didn't get too see one thing I love in romance animes, I really thought the romance were amazing in this anime. Without doubt I would gladly rewatch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nDo you love mystery and romance combined?\\n\r\nThen Gosick is probably an anime for you.",

            "content": "First of all for all you TL;DR-ers, I have a summary right here:\r\nGood points:\r\n- Grabs your attention from the early episodes\r\n- Beautifully interconnected plot arcs\r\n- Many interesting back stories and historical references\r\n- Suspense keeps you hooked but doesn't leave you hanging\r\n- Complete and touching resolution\r\n- Multifaceted characters who are also animated very beautifully\r\nBad points:\r\n- Some filler episode(s) in the middle and beginning\r\n- Female lead can get really annoying sometimes when she tries to keep up the tsundere\r\n- Male lead is very cliched and is always annoying (VICTORIKAAAAA!)\r\nSummary point:\r\nThis anime is best classified as a ROMANCE anime - it's generally about love. Even the crimes areabout love. There is an element of MYSTERY to it, and though this is central to the plot and is a central theme, it isn't what the whole anime is about. I'm not saying the mysteries are bad, the mysteries are good, but this anime is about going beyond solving the mystery to appreciating all the motives and motifs, the characters and situations behind the crimes, and the overall inter-connectedness of the abovementioned mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere was no incredibly large overarching plot throughout the series, but there are a series of subplots that help to bring out characters and their personalities. There are two main arcs, I would say, the first being a sleuth of \"mini-crimes\" that Victorique solves over and over again, slowly dropping more clues about her controversial origin, about her dark past, and the second about Albert de Blois' evil plan to use Sauville for selfish gain. This sets the pace pretty well and makes the anime watchable.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc was more about understanding the motive behind Albert de Blois' evil scheme and how Victorique falls into the picture. She is basically being used as a pawn to generate more pawns for Albert's master plan. The more important part though, was how her mother foiled Albert's plan. This part of the story became more interesting and was a big difference from the usual \"solve the crime\" we had in the first arc, and introduced, for the first time, some genuine conflict in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEven many loose ends were tied up at the end, logically, and beautifully. I absolutely loved how all or if not most of the crimes, for example, Queen Coco, Blue Rose, Leviathan, even the beginning crime on the ship, all managed to form a very complete and substantial narrative about the overall plot of the anime. It seems all completely disconnected at first, but slowly, more and more pieces fall into place and it seems like the people in the anime are all interconnected through the crimes and all have a nice backstory to them.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly enjoyed the case of Leviathan because that was probably one of the most crucial crimes that many people were associated with, and had the most convincing explanation and motivation behind it. It was also very well developed. The whole anime was full of foreshadowing and links abound everywhere, so it was a really good plot. Even the ending was touching and summed everything up nicely.\\n\\n\r\nI do want to minus at least a point for all the filler that was in the show though - mainly between the first and the second arc, where they tried to add some romance in but failed to have any actual plot progress for some episodes as a result.\\n\\n\r\nI'm also deducting another point for the general \"evil plan\" that was never really fleshed out by Albert de Blois. It was all very melodramatic and such but the plan itself didn't actually seem very impressive, nor was it very groundbreaking. And it honestly wasn't very believable that everyone would suddenly don rabbit heads and go to war just because some monster told them to. I'm quite sure the opposite would have happened.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character in this show is ... NOT the main protagonist, Kujo Kazuya, but instead the incredibly beautiful and stunning Cordelia. She is not only super caring, all-loving mother figure, but she is also portrayed as mysterious, dark, determined, very mature and holds deep but subtle sadness throughout the anime. Also, she is a top-class dual-wield blade dancer, that's pretty awesome. She's one of the main reasons I knew this anime was going to end well.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad she isn't a main character though. Victorique on the other hand, while not that awesome as a character, shows astonishing character growth throughout the anime. From the lazy, take-things-for-granted, unladylike, quarrelsome and pampered little kid that she was portrayed as at the start, and it honestly got quite annoying midway though the anime, she went and did a 180 degree turn - becoming determined, fighting for her life, appreciative, forgiving and truly loving Kujo. In a sense, becoming a lot like her mother, who is the best character. So even though she was annoying to a degree, she got less annoying as the story progressed.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the male lead, Kujo, is just really cliche that it's pretty bad. The same old quirky kid on the block who is new to everything, stumbles on something never heard of, and has misadventures of every kind, is bullied by the person he loves but his persistence and hard work pays off and she finally sees how much he cares for her. Yup, it is the typical nice guy in the romance department, and nothing very interesting there. The fact that he is also proven to be only useful for saving Victorique from bad situations further proves this very boring lead. One can argue that his character grew abit - he became slightly more wise and mature and understood Victorique more, but his character traits were in a sense \"complete\" from day 1, he had everything he had at the end, from the beginning. That's minus 2 points.\\n\\n\r\nOther side cast characters were very sadly sidelined. Avril, the happy-go-lucky girl who also happens to be a love interest, and then is suddenly dropped midway through the final arc despite ongoing hints that there may be repercussions from this third wheel. Grevil, the one who is and isn't, who wants to do what he can't do and doesn't want to do what he must, was a very interesting character who had an excellent back story but it was never fleshed out enough to derive some sense of his values and motives. Jacqueline, the woman whom Grevil loves, who is full of compassion and is supposedly one of the strongest female figure in the anime, but little is said about her, and she basically only makes cameo appearances, not affecting the plot much whatsoever. I wished to see alot more of those three than the stupid filler episodes I got. So that's minus 1 point.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of this, character development through backstory is definitely one of the best I've seen. The plot is so intricately woven into the characters' lives that you automatically become attracted to them, so that's definitely a plus point.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not too fascinated by the animation department, but I would say that the art was generally well-drawn and visually appealing. Things were crisp and clear when they needed to be and the dark theme really helped with all the mystery-like portions. There was a particular segment where there were a few brief actions scenes between Albert and Cordelia, slashing at each other, and that art was impressive.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the better audio soundtracks I've heard. I loved the OP to the core. Seriously, it sounds like that came right out of a shounen anime, it's downright awesome. The first ED was pretty good, but I absolutely disliked the second ED because of it's slowness and really boring progression. So I have to minus 2 points for that.\\n\\n\r\nSound track in the anime is once again very well thought out, and synced well with the whole Victorian-era theme that it was running for. (I wonder if they intended to pun on the name victorique).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't for the filler, the score would be much higher. But still, it was certainly enjoyable over most of the anime. The romance was a bit slow to build up and Victorique got annoying sometimes, but in the end it all paid off. It was touching, it was smooth, it was also very exciting at one point. I just wish they could have taken away the filler in the middle of the arcs and just place more emphasis on the whole final showdown at Sauville.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI expected to rate this 7 initially, but the last two episodes really tied everything up so well that I have to increase my rating for this anime. It was a very good finish, and a very good start. Definitely recommend this and I promise it won't be a waste of your precious time.",

            "content": "Synopsis & Plot:\r\n\tGosick (stylized as GOSICK) is a story about stories. Ghost stories to be specific. The story revolves around the Dark Shinigami, Kazuya Kujo, and the Golden Fairy of the Library, Victorique and their constant involvement in solving bizarre occurances for the inspector Graviel de Blois. Throughout the story, the Dark Shinigami begins to unravel the countless mysteries that surround his newfound friend Victorique. However, with each answer several more mysteries pop up. Just who is the Victorique and what is the truth behind the story of the Golden Fairy of the Library?\r\nCharacters:\r\n\tThe characters in Gosick all have a little quirk to them. Beginningwith Kazuya Kujo, an exchange student from Japan. He's known throughout the school as the Dark Shinigami because of his 'black eyes that swallow up the darkness'. His name came from the ghost story 'The Springtime Shinigami'. He thought that Victorique was a doll on their first meeting and that he had dreamt the entire thing until his homeroom teacher confirmed Victorique's existence as a student of the Academy. As a protagonist, he is just and believes in protecting Victorique from danger. Victorique on the other hand, reminds me of Shinku from Rozen Maiden with a combination of her and Zero no Tsukaima's Louise de la Valliere's personalities minus the physical abuse. She is sarcastic and speaks to him the way one would speak to a servant yet still blushing when he says something the typical protagonist would say. The rest of the characters are just delightfully eccentric; from the overenthusiastic homeroom teacher to Inspector de Blois and his splendidly animated YuGiOh hairstyle, there's sure to be someone for everyone to love.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Graphics:\\n\r\n\tThe art is done generally well. That I attribute to the time and the availability of resources to make a scene look picturesque. It's enough for you to be interested but not enough to potentially wow you. The characters are also, generally well done with my only...problem for want of a better word being with the plainness of Kujo's design. He definitely looks like the author spent the majority of the time developing our lovely loli's design over his. The most interesting design is by far Inspector de Blois and his hair. I just can't get enough of that hairstyle. I think that special mention should be made of the animation during the OP and ED sequence as they seemed to be a slightly more developed than the backgrounds themselves.\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound:\\n\r\n\tMy favorite part of this is the music. BY FAR. The music was organised by Nakagawa Koutarou who did the soundtracks for other note worthy series such as Code Geass, Hayate the Combat Butler and 07 Ghost. The main roles of Kujo and Victorique are voiced by Eguchi Takuya and Yuuki Aoi respectively. The role of Kujo is Eguchi's first main role which based on reception from fans, he seems to pull of well. Yuuki on the other hand is no stranger to main roles such as Kishitani Shinra from Durarara!!, Yagyuu Jubei from the fall 2010 anime Hyakka Ryouran Samurai Girls and most recently as Kaname Madoka from the popular mahou shoujo anime, Puella Magi Magica Madoka. For me, the sound of this anime gets a perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n\tI sat to watch this anime after a stressful day of school and before I knew it, it was dark and I was 7 episodes in. I don't remember the last time I'd watched so many episodes of an anime that was not a typical shounen like One Piece without falling asleep. I had heard good things about the GOSICK novel and that the anime was just a little shy of its original's reputation but it seems to surprising me in all kinds of ways. I look forward to seeing more of Gosick in the near future. \\n",

            "content": "Sit back and enjoy an anime that dives into history -- a page in history.\r\nAUTHOR'S NOTE:\r\nThis is my first review on MyAnimeList and I could have easily wrote a review on the more popular animes but I've finally decided to pick Gosick as my first review. I've made sure to complete the anime and go straight to this site when everything is still fresh in my mind. If you don't like details and intrinsic writing, then please skip this review.\r\nSTORY (10/10): \r\nOne of most intriguing settings in an anime that I've seen in a very long time. The story is a story within a storyand there are many, many elements entangled within it. You name it: romance, drama, mystery, action, adventure, suspense, horror, comedy...everything is neatly packaged into this anime. If this anime had a genre, it would most definitely be historic. The story dives into a page in history, in the year post-World War I ~ World War II (1920s ~ 1945). \\n\\n\r\nThe story is compelling and masterfully woven into a tale that makes generic historic animes look like Naruto Shippuden. The concept of Gosick is not for those who can't comprehend novelistic theory and ideas. Although it's basically a Japanese cartoon, Gosick can be viewed as an historic epic. Right from the start, we are introduced to the sense of reality in the opening which slowly climbs to the climax and finally, drops to the resolution. Gosick has successfully defined the dramatic structure into an anime. Also, what I love about Gosick is it's authenticity for its historical value and accurate cultural notions. Gosick does not fail to educate the viewers on the historical accuracy of its timeline. Since we are in 1920s, we see clock towers, pendants, carriages, Euro-etiquette, and live stage performances. Gosick has outdone itself in dragging the viewers back in time. Now let's drop the bourgeoisie act and come back to the \"normal\" realm: Gosick kicks ass. And for an anime that seems to center around mystery and romance, the viewers are given more than what they've bargained for.\\n\\n\r\nART (9/10):\\n\r\nApplause for the artwork and visuals for the production team. From the OP, story, to the EP, Gosick does not disappoint when it comes to anime craftsmanship. Even the background is not dull but colorful and mesmerizing. From the tall towering library, the garden maze, the academy, and even assortments, Gosick is pleasing to the eye. The flow of the animation is incredible and it can only support the symbolism and the plot very well. The animation in the OP is colorful and captivating, almost-paper like figurines. The EP is dark, captivating, and I might even add moody. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough we obviously see laziness, one would barely notice them. Very impressed on how hard the production team worked to create an anime so delicate that the violence in it seems dark and romantic at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9/10): \\n\r\nThe OP has become a favorite of mine ever since I've heard it. Although it never changes throughout the entire anime, \"Destin Histoire\" by yoshiki*lisa is the perfect theme song for Gosick. The first half of the EP, \"Resuscitated Hope\" by Lisa Komine has also become a favorite. The artist has a chilling, yet calm and powerful voice that melds miraculously with the emotions that are triggered in Gosick. During the second half, the EP becomes melancholic and emotional, which flawlessly flows with the plot of Gosick, as the second half is reaching its climax and entering the resolution. \"unity\" by Lisa Komine may be the least favorite out of the 3 songs used, but it does its job of keeping the emotion of the anime together.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art is the bread and butter of Gosick. As mentioned, the production team are the masterminds of creating chemistry between art and sound. The OP and EP songs and the animation that go with it are able to cling onto the plot, and I can't get over how clever and outstanding it is.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9/10):\\n\r\nMeet Kujo Kazuya, the international student, dubbed \"Black Reaper\" by his fellow peers at the academy. At first, we see a pathetic hero who has run away from his family and struggling to make new friends in a new environment. Honestly, I was not very fond of him, as he reinforces an old stereotype for Asian males (passivity) and has quite a dull personality. Even though he proudly considers himself to be a third son of an imperial soldier, he does not act it until the drawing end of the anime. However, he is a gold-hearted child who upholds his promises, is caring, and loyal which can be a likable character to some, if not many. In addition, his immaturity begins to shed its skin once fate (with a speck of curiosity) draws him to a large tower-like library and introduces him to his friend, romantic interest, and soulmate -- \\n\\n\r\nEnter Victorique de Bloise. This cute, short, chubby-faced, Victorian-esque, sweets-obsessed loli \"detective\", aka, Golden Fairy, may be the only reason why Gosick may interest anime bystanders (Hello, I am trillshit. And I, am a lolicon). However, I don't blame her. She is the epitome of a tsundere, but the complex is heavily supported by a very dark past. Quite understandable, if you have the fate of the world upon your shoulders (that's for you to find out, if you decide to watch the anime). \\n\\n\r\nThese two characters can be the only important figures to the viewers, though the side characters are also very important, which only proves how good Gosick is. As the anime progresses, we are introduced to villains, murderers, magicians, thieves, and folklore that threaten the hero and heroine, in which the latter always outwits them using her \"wellspring of wisdom\". Of course, you must consider their allies and friends which are responsible and protectors for their survival, in the mental-psychological realm, and their very lives.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (10/10):\\n\r\nObviously, I have enjoyed this anime to the fullest. Considering that I've watched three episodes consecutively, it took me a little more than a week to finish. And I'm extremely sad that it's finally over. This anime has been a fun ride, with strong forces of suspense, romance, and drama taking me on all kinds of highs and lows. Even as a critic, it was difficult for me to rate this anime but in the end, I'm convinced that Gosick is a masterpiece of its own. I really don't know if I'll be able to find another anime like Gosick. It is truly a peculiar, fascinating anime. I challenge anyone to give this anime a try and see how it works for you.\\n\\n\\n",

The mystery element was the second element to carry it, along with the plot that was skimming underneath and becoming more prominent towards the end of the anime. \r\nI related to both two characters easily and cared about them a lot. The struggles, the issues and how it all tied together at the end. The side characters were lacking in comparison, and only had one purpose/motive for being there but still, they were likable enough.They might have been cut outs but they were not annoying that I wanted to pick up a lamp and smash myself over the head repeatedly. \\n\\n\r\nIt's one of those animes that was unique to me, and could incorporate the whole supernatural element without needing to go so far beyond the bullshit line that nothing makes sense. It was very realistic and relatable.",

This is really nice for the fans, but it also sets a very misleading tone for the series, which causes everyone to wonder what the f* happened when the plot kicks in.\r\n In short, if you're coming here looking for a mystery/detective series, you came to the wrong place.

            "content": "Gosick is a mystery, drama, and romance anime taking place after WWI that focuses on the main characters Victorique and Kujo. This show tells a strong tale of romance even in the midst of all the tension after WWI and close before WWII.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story was simply amazing, as it wasn't a show focused on mystery with romance as a subplot developing on the side. Each mystery not only related to and revealed more about Victorique as a character but also advanced her relationship Kujo further, showing how each mystery is essential and irreplaceable for the story. Also, the story takes place in historical contextand is able to successfully tell such a heart-warming and touching story within the intense and dreadful setting from the time between two large scale wars. The story runs throughout the 24 episodes at a steady pace and felt complete with the phenomenal ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThis show had fascinating art, being aired in 2011. It also portrayed the time period really well, making you feel as if you were actually there at the time with the background art and the clothing design for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe OP was really nice, and the way each episode ended with the ED just creates a mood to see the next episode, especially the first ED. The BGMs were also one of the parts of the show that made me feel like I was actually there, up close in some of the scenes. Sometimes when Victorique gets upset and maybe loud, it never felt annoying to me at all. (Even when she's singing)  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nFor the main characters, we have Kujo, who seems to always be able to involve himself in some sort of mystery wherever he goes and Victorique, who is brilliant at solving mysteries but has her talents totally isolated and depreciated for one reason or another. Almost all the characters have clear dreams and goals they wish to achieve and all put in more than enough effort to achieve them. While Victorique might seem to be stubborn, cold, and distant at first, but as the show goes on, she'll become the type of character you can almost never forget. And while Kujo might seem like the typical \"nice guy\" and dense main character, he isn't as he actually very clear about who he deeply cares about. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI've been a huge fan of mystery when I was younger, but as I got older I couldn't find good sources for mystery as much and soon came to forget my interest in the genre. However, this anime brought it back to me as each mystery captivated me and entrapped me within the plot along with the characters in the show. I couldn't stop watching the show and finished it in just one day.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a masterpiece, all the way from the alluring start of the show to the emotional and complete end. I have no complaints about this show at all mostly and this is one of my favorite animes out there.\\n\r\nOverall=10/10 ^^",

What is it like to know that detective and join their journey?\r\nGosick is one of those anime that uses the early 1900's era and turn it into a work of art. It is amazing how well the anime is put. I honestly thought it would be some mere superstition, but I was proven wrong. This anime brings mystery and romance together in a unique way. As the two character journey through to solve mysteries, their bond grew.\r\nThere are vast amount of mysteries that Gosick have. Each mysteries were good and well thought.The beginning was amazing and the plot from there went on to a smooth sail. The romance grew and turned into a beautiful flower at the end. The symbolism that was used in the anime kept me thinking and why it was significant. What makes this anime great was that there was 'the struggle'. Victorique and Kazuya went through hardships together and their bond was what kept them together. The only complaint I have is that the plot was quite cliche if you watched many anime/movies.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was unique. It is the art style of Alphonse Mucha. I tend to love art because it amazes me and I was surprised that it was brought into this anime. Due to this, I found the opening for Gosick beautiful and one of my favorite. The animations for the anime was good and I have no complaints for it. The opening/ending was beautiful. I had to say that the endings were well put and how they all have a beautiful voice. The pitch and tone was good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime and I feel like this anime should have a better spotlight. The bonus of this anime was that Victorique was a tsundere gothic loli. I tend to like the moe and loli genre and I've got to say that Victorique is one of my favorite character I've seen from a broad amount of animes.",

Sadness was one of them. But it was soon replaced with happiness. I love how this anime gives you emotions, then allows you to cry such as I did. That is why I love anime more than real life shows. It goes to show you that anime is something that you can relate to.",

I even stopped and  then only a few week later did I watch it again. That only happened with the first few episodes. But the rest of the story was too awesome. I never expected it to be so good. Victorique is an awesome detective. She resembles L from Death Note in many ways. But I think that she might be even smarter than L. Victorique and Kujo make such a cute couple. The ending was excellent. It's veryrare for an anime to have such an ending. I never even expected it. I read a lot of crime novels like Agatha Christie's Poirot and I even watched the series on tv. I enjoyed this anime as much as I enjoyed Agatha Christie's stories. Overall this anime was excellent. So I would gladly recommend this anime to anyone.",

(my dear reader...) Because you actually clicked this review and dared to look upon it and see what this crazy person is writing about. I applaude you for doing so.\r\n3rd review on an anime I just recently watched and finally finished, Gosick. An anime centered on mystery, drama, and romance...but I'd also like to say that this anime isn't your typical mystery because the mystery involves fairytales andmyths. Supposedly really good mysteries from the novel, it's original form of work. I never read the novels so I'm not entirely sure how well the anime did the novel justice, but to me, the anime was still great and interesting to watch and I very much enjoyed the mysteries in each episode. Some of them you'll recognized but the rest are different. You'll like those the most. \\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is a 9 in my book, but the overall concept is an 8. The reason being is because the characters couldn't hold the storyline quite well somehow. For instance the main character, Kujou seemed like an \"annoying shoujo girl always shouting the boys name.\" \\n\r\nEvery. Single. Time! \"Victorique! Victorique! Victorique!!!\" lol but hopefully like me, you'll get over this minor detail. Cause the characters are still good since they made the storyline move well. My favorite character, Victorique the mastermind of the entire anime, is the one who can solve the crimes with grace and skill like any great detective. Her past plays a huge role to the story and because of this, makes her a very complex character unlike Kujou with only little clips of himself. (but oh well) Besides the main characters, each and every one had something unique about them and overall they were good, but not great. Again, the story is what drives this anime. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up really quick of this whole entire anime, the storyline is a 9 because of it's very very very interesting plots and fairytale/myth like mysteries that make you want to watch what happens next. Art and characters both an 8 since they're good and likeable. But if you find them super and amazing then that's entirely your opinion. Enjoyment 9. YEAH! Anyone who likes mysteries with a dab of romance in it will definitely like this. Oh and the romance doesn't get in the way of the sometimes dark themes in this anime, but it actually helps make the anime more sweet and memorable in a sense. (especially towards the end...) Overall 8. \\n\\n\r\nUhhh....what else. *mumble* Enjoy? lol Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "Gosick was originally a Japanese light novel series by Kazuki Sakuraba. Set in a fictional European country in 1924, the story is centered around two young students named Victorique and Kazuya.\r\nVictorique is a mysterious, brilliant girl who only leaves the library to sleep. Hidden from the outside world by her family since birth, Victorique is as physically and emotionally small and fragile as her brain is huge and complex.\r\nAs the third son of an Imperial soldier of Japan, Kazuya has always lived in the shadow of his father and his brothers, wondering if he will ever have enough strength and muster to protect anyone.\r\nKazuya relieson Victorique's mind to solve difficult mysteries. Kazuya has to keep both of them alive long enough to solve the mysteries and present the solution to the authorities. \\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters (9/10)\\n\r\nAmong the divergent genres and plot elements, Gosick looks like a bizarre fever. Seriously, Sherlock Holmes and Gothic Lolita? The enduring popularity of Sherlock Holmes has led to hundreds of works based on the character \u2013 both adaptations into other media and original stories - so it's not new anymore. But Gosick actually works better than that, it isn't all just about solving mysteries to satisfy any Holmes fan, the brilliance lies in its lead. And even if Holmes is a runty Gothic princess and Watson is a troubled Japanese teenage boy, it proves to be one of the most potential.\\n\\n\r\nIn the year 1924, young exchange student Kujo Kazuya comes to the French-speaking fictional country of Sauville to attend the exclusive St. Marguerite Academy, where urban legends and horror stories are all the rage. Much to his displeasure, the local students refer him as \"Black Reaper\" based on his Oriental appearance. In an attempt to understand the local legends, he visits the school library. There he finds Victorique, a doll-like girl who speaks oddly about a \"fountain of wisdom\" within her but also soon proves very adept at sorting out the particulars of mysteries. Though initially skeptical of each other, the two form an important bond and begin struggling to solve cases while being hindered by various figures related to Victorique's past and the upcoming World War.\\n\\n\r\nNow having a Gothic Lolita as the lead character, anyone would confirm it's an anime fandom's fascination of blond-haired Goth loli character, but this is an entire different concept; in fact, it determines to show it will be different. The first case plays smoothly enough, and the second case seems to prove Gosick is an episodic mystery series, but if so then the entire first twelve episodes look to be more akin to mini-arcs. This is good, while at first they seem to be only vaguely related to each other, there are clues and hints about Victorique's past given throughout the series that there are more than meets their eyes. On the down side, Gosick completely features the spoiled parts of criminology, introducing the first episode with mystery oldies like locked-room murder followed by phantom thief or such.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, the second half washes out the retread solving mystery elements and becomes more intense. Loses some of the detective feel of earlier episodes and focuses heavier on plot involving political schemes, personal cult and masked alchemist; there's still the Victorique/Kazuya pair travel around solving cases which strongly show some nice further character development and provides hint about both short-term and long-term story elements. The suggestion that we're going to see a fuller picture of the past and future events which set this story up also helps keep it from being dulled by its episodic nature.\\n\\n\r\nBlessed, this series has an interesting duo. Unlike many detective/sidekick combinations, Victorique and Kazuya genuinely work well together. There's the obvious utility of their relationship, Kazuya gathers and provides a considerable amount of evidence which required Victorique's brain. His naturally tolerant nature allows Victorique to act out as much as she wants, revealing the insecure girl under her proud personality and genius mind. Victorique tends to test Kazuya's best, uncovering his utmost loyalty and courage. Together, they are a formidable team no matter how much of a tsundere/nice guy pair they may look and it's a grant to see their relationship strengthen.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\r\nGosick is a faithful treatment to the eyes. Gorgeous landmark and forest of St. Marguerite Academy elaborate Victorian unique architecture as well as foggy, apparently abandoned Gray Wolf village show its ugliness, yet affections like inspector Grevil's ridiculous hairdo and a matter concerning luggage are clearly designed to keep the story from taking itself too seriously. Blond, dresses in black Gothic clothes, Victorique's adorable character design will undoubtedly make her highly popular.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nVoice acting is another treat, Victorique's seiyuu, Yuuki Aoi did an excellent job at this young detective, giving her many spotlights: her weird laughing laughs off the seriousness given by her opponents, sadistic tone when toying Kazuya's feeling and several tsundere vibe make her irresistibly lovable. Eguchi Takuya's Kazuya shines with his good nature, Avril simply sounds too playful and inspector Grevil's change of tone depending on mood are credible.\\n\\n\r\nThe typically excellent music score helps too. It handles action, creeping horror, incremental tension, and even light humor with pretty much equal skill. The only used OP \"Destine Histoire\" is just cuddly gentle while the other two ED sound more depressing. Supported with visuals, the first ED \"Resuscitated Hope\" by Kosame Lisa would cover Victorique's embodiment of her own mystery before the second half which replaced by \"unity\" - a bit more folksy and opera-like theme. The singers are not very well-known artists, but they know how to go over-the-top, and frequently does, with occasionally beautiful results.\\n\\n\r\nBONES makes a sharp production with the artistic effort here, and being a mystery series mixed with humor like Darker than Black, Gosick was given the same treatment, the series has solid fun and murder factors going for it. Victorique's charm is much tied up in her cute habits: rolling on the floor while making hapless noise, laughing her sadistic monologue laugh, chomping down her ceramic pipe (with no tobacco) are animated with care. The library, a marvelously improbable maze of spiral staircases and walkways built in what appears to be the remnants of a medieval tower, is a particular treat. And the nastiness is even nastier through the surprise attack and frightfulness that registers on corpses, puppets and patterns.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nAs a pretty diversion, you can enjoy Gosick without hesitation. To think that Gosick isn't a great mystery series because it debuts with Victorique clears the first murder of the series too quickly could jeopardize its own merit. Still, nearly every episode features its own mystery story and folklore, too, and a classic one at that, but it is still cast within the overall context of a larger story. In addition to being cute as a button, Victorique also has an immediate and adorable rapport with the hapless, though not helpless, Kazuya, who in turn provides a light counterpoint to the often grim events surrounding them.\\n\\n\r\nThe sleuthing is ultimately a sideshow though. Gosick is a thriller at heart, and thrill it does. Standout sequences include a study in suspense involving a rotund counselor and a very shady patient. Not that much of a loss, it contributes a satisfying ending more dynamic than the outcome of its own WWII, which is so awful as to be unwatchable\u2014in a good way. If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes or these kinds, you owe it to yourself to check Gosick out.\\n\\n\r\nGood:\\n\r\n- As intelligent, punishingly suspenseful, and morally relevant as ever.\\n\r\n- Plenty of terrifying Victorique/Kujo cuteness.\\n\r\n- Music score and artistry are as beautiful as ever.\\n\r\nBad:\\n\r\n- Loves old detective cliches a little too much.",

In fact I didn't even bother reading the synopsis back then- I was THAT put off by the picture. But,  I had nothing to watch yesterday so I threw this on for the hell of it. \r\nI have to admit the first few episodes were nothing special. It sets itself up as a Sherlock Holmes-esque murder mystery plot. But the mysteries themselves are incredibly easy to solve. Little didI know I was being setup...\\n\\n\r\nSomehow, out of nowhere, I was whisked away without warning into an incredibly well woven tale of political intrigue and emotional stimulation. I was hooked, deeply hooked, and I found myself powering through each episode. I didn't make dinner, I didn't go to bed at a decent hour and once I did finally go to sleep  I woke up 3 hours ahead of my alarm just to watch some more. And here I am just having finished the last episode desperately trying to write a review that will hopefully entice people to watch this, despite their initial ho-hum impressions of the series based on the cover art.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has quickly become one of my all time favorites. It's brilliantly written (albeit slow to start) and well executed. The character development is more than I usually see and the love story is beautiful. This anime had me laughing, crying and sobbing with delight. I felt like a menopausal woman having mood swings and hot flashes.\\n\\n\r\nNow that it's over, I'm out of breath and deeply impressed.",

            "content": "Well, looks like I have a new favorite anime. For a while I've been putting Gosick off just because overall, the art wasn't too appealing too me- But, honestly, my first impressions of this were disproved the minute I started watching. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nLet's get my one complaint out of the way for the story, and that would be Victorique's constant referral to her knowledge as the 'Wellspring of Wisdom', which I thought would have some significant value to the story, but it wasn't too important that she specifically called it that. She's definitely a genius, and has abilities others could only dream of (which isVERY important to the story), and her childlike demeanor definitely hides her abilities well.  Overall, the series was great, and loosely based (and when I say loosely, I mean, don't go looking for strict comparisons because you'll find maybe four in the entire thing) off Sherlock Holmes which made it interesting to watch. The school, the cases, the deeper plot hidden behind and the idea of utter political corruption that they managed to mix in was great, and left very few areas where no action was taking place.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I said before, the art was what kind of put me off to the series before, but it's not that bad at all. Especially in comparison to some shows I've recently started. The scenery is gorgeous, the animation isn't bad, and it's definitely appealing to watch. They definitely added in tidbits of symbolism with the color choices in episodes which I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall, the soundtrack for the series was pretty basic, nothing really new or exciting, but the OP and ED, wow. By the end of the series, the songs were breaking my heart. But other than that, nothing really exceptional. Voice Acting was good, again, very average, but still good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are great. I really enjoyed Kujou so much and fell in love with him, but of course, his flaw was that he lacked the power to be observant which is why Victorique was his perfect pair. While he was sweet and kind of slow at times, she was always on top of everything and a bit rude. Opposites attract and all that. At times both of them got on my nerves, but all in all they were fantastic, and the perfect MC's.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 10/10\\n\r\nI loved this series. My friend and I have already started reading the manga now, and I've rewatched a few episodes over again having only just finished the series an hour ago. It's definitely one of my favorites now, and there's nothing really bad I can say about it unless I get nitpick minor details. Loved the characters, loved the story, will watch again.",

            "content": "It seems like everyone enjoys an old-fashioned mystery. Who doesn't love titles like \"Sherlock Holmes\"? Gosick tries to appeal to this same audience by giving the viewer a complicated mystery, and a detective who seems to notice every inconsequential detail in order to solve the crime. This can either be an excellent formula for success, or a simple, rinse and repeat ad nauseam to the end of the series.\r\nGosick manages to avoid the latter extreme, but never quite reaches the former either. Mysteries can be boring if they aren't enough to draw the viewer in and make them try to guess what will happen next.This can be a real challenge, because a single mystery that spans an entire 24 episode show could prove to be a real drag. Gosick attempts to circumvent this by telling several smaller stories in three or four episode \"mini-arcs\". These mini-arcs usually contribute to the overall story in some way, but this isn't immediately obvious until the latter parts of the show in many cases.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is set in the imaginary country of \"Sabure\", taking place between the World Wars, at an academy where students from all over the world come to learn. The academy has a very rich history, including lots of folklore that influences the culture. Many of these tales are entwined in the mysteries that the characters attempt to solve, providing some back story, and also a great deal of plausibility to the mysteries that occur.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are even affected by this folklore, as Kujo and Victorique (the protagonists) are respectively called \"The Spring Reaper\" and \"The Golden Fairy\". These two make an interesting pair, with Kujo, the kindhearted Japanese exchange student, and Victorique, the clever, introverted, yet demanding girl who spends much of her time in one of the world's largest libraries, as the ones who attempt to solve the mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nVictorique isn't always the most likable character, as she rarely praises Kujo for anything he does, and even scolds him for being late when he brings her sweets. Ultimately, this is due to her harsh upbringing, but can still cause one to wonder why Kujo chooses to be friends with her. Sometimes, I wasn't certain whether these two were friends, or if something romantic was happening between them. I won't spoil the ending for you, but it did little to clear up my confusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is certainly passable, but not amazing. Much of the art has that a sort of Gothic feel and theme to it, evoked by the stone buildings, and spires at the top of towers. The character designs are pretty interesting, especially characters like Grevil, whose hairstyle shall likely never be duplicated by even the most tenacious cosplayer. The backgrounds and animations are all good, but nothing eye-popping.\\n\\n\r\nAs or the music, the opening and ending themes were all excellent, and I rarely skipped them. The score itself wasn't anything especially outstanding. It fit the setting of the show, but wasn't ever enough to make me sit back and think about the quality, whether good or bad. The voice acting was quite good, probably a notch above the music. I especially noticed it with Victorique, whose feisty personality could easily have been ruined by the wrong voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that Gosick was a very well-designed story, with a small cast of lovable characters, but not quite enough story for the entire twenty-four episodes of the show. When there is a less-involved plot, one typically expects the story to be character-driven, but Gosick was much more plot-driven, which left it feeling somewhat empty in a few places.\\n\\n\r\nNow don't get the impression that I didn't like Gosick. I quite enjoyed this show, enough so that I finished it relatively quickly (by my standards, at least). I still recommend it to anyone; I simply feel that there are a few shortcomings that prevent this show from becoming truly \"excellent\". This show is great fun, just no masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nScores:\\n\r\nStory-(8/10)\\n\r\nArt-(7/10)\\n\r\nSound- (8/10)\\n\r\nCharacter-(6/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment- (7/10)\\n\r\nOverall- (7/10)\\n\\n\r\n(To both \"Helpful\" and \"Not Helpful\" voters: Feedback is greatly appreciated.)\\n",

            "content": "*WARNING: Few spoilers ahead to not just Gosick but a few anime shows as well.*\r\nI am sucker for the historical mystery genre. Many anime taking place in a western historical setting mainly involves mystery. Mystery is what Gosick is all about. An anime taking place in 1924, in a fictional country called Saubure (or Seville if you want to spell it right). Gosick, in my opinion is what happens when you have the main characters of Rozen Maiden and put them in a situations similar to of Umineko, Black Butler and Baccano. At first glance, Gosick looks cutesy with the main character being a gothiclolita detective. But no. It's mostly a murder mystery that isn't afraid to show off a little blood - well, compared to some anime it isn't very graphic. But was it a great detective anime? Hell yes! Personally, I even liked it more than Death Note (feel free to disagree). Here are reasons why.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\r\nKazuya Kujou is a Japanese student at Saint Marguerite Academy. Because of his ethnicity, people give him the nickname Black Reaper. However, when he decides to search for ghost stories in the library, he meets a girl known as Victorique de Blois, who is basically a lolita Sherlock Holmes. The country of Saubure is known for loving ghost stories. Those said ghost stories suddenly appears in real life and it is up to Kujou and Victorique to solve those mysteries about those ghost stories.\\n\r\nThe first half of the show starts off with different arcs containing all sorts of different mysteries. As the second arc approaches, the story becomes more darker, more linear and more connected. Mostly focusing Victorique and her family. One flaw I can find with the plot is that some of the mysteries of the first half can be mostly unrelated to the main plot. I'm talking about the first two mysteries: the ghost ship and the ghost in the warehouse. These two mysteries are almost forgotten for the rest of the series. But I do give it credit for introducing some of the main cast and being very entertaining. Oh yeah, there were also two filler episodes. But at least there's only two.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, everything else was great. Most of the mysteries are very unique and very interesting and I liked it how in the second half, some of the elements from previous mysteries are used to solve a new one. This makes the mysteries connect to each other to solve a big one. And Gosick does it really well. And now, what are my thoughts on the ending? I won't spoil any details, but I will say this. In 2018 alone, I have completed 4 anime. The first 3 I watched had questionable endings: Death Note - ugghh; Akame ga Kill - meh; and Soul Eater - meh, but I still loved the show anyways. As for Gosick, finally, I managed to have watched an anime with a happy ending! Not the best but it was still good ending compared to most anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7/10\\n\r\nHere we have the biggest downside of Gosick: the characters. Most of the characters in Gosick are forgettable, one-dimensional and shoved off the side, because the story is all about Kujou and Victorique and only them alone. For the major supporting characters, you have Cecile the cheerful teacher, Avril the third wheel love interest, Marquis your average main villain, Greville (that hair) as the eccentric big brother. If there is one supporting character that did stand out from the rest it will have to be both Cordelia and Brain. I got to admit they were both pretty unique characters. And then there's Kujou, who is basically just like every bland anime protagonist. But I will say that he is one the best of his kind as he does develop a bit throughout the story.\\n\r\nAnd saving the best for last is Victorique, who is probably the best thing about Gosick. She looks like a gothic lolita doll. But she has the mind of Sherlock Holmes as she can solve any sort of mystery. She may be bossy but at times she is very sensitive, clumsy and has a sweet tooth. She is definitely the best tsundere I've ever seen in anime. At first, I was going to give the character score a 6, but thanks to Victorique I gave it a 7 instead.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\r\nGosick was produced by the beloved crew at Bones. Responsible for some of my favorites like Soul Eater, FMA and Boku no Hero. This has to be one of their most underrated works and the art styles is much like most of their works. Gosick's animation matches the feel of early 20th century Europe perfectly. Even though I don't speak French I do say that they handled the language very well (with the exception of the country's name itself). Also is it just me, because at times I feel like I'm watching Baccano instead of Gosick. I mean, when I watched the 18th episode of the series, I thought, \"they're going Baccano here!\" since it took place on a train where murder is involved. The art styles almost look exactly alike.Then again they both take place during the mid-war era (with Baccano taking place nearly a decade after Gosick). Overall, the art is nice.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: 9/10\\n\r\nThere isn't a lot to talk about with the music. But it is very pretty and it matches the European feel of the show. Since it took place in the 20's I was expecting a couple of jazz music thrown into the soundtrack. And surprisingly they didn't. But I think it's best that way. The opening Destin Histoire by Risa Yoshiki sounds okay, but I felt that it doesn't match the show itself and sadly, it didn't change. As for the 1st ending; HOLY CRAP! It was great. Really great. Resuscitated Hope by Lisa Komine is by far one of the best anime endings ever and it matches the show perfectly. The 2nd ending Unity also by Komine sounds nice, but it was a awkward switch from a gothic rock to a folk rock. \\n\\n\r\nDUB: 7/10\\n\r\nSince it takes place in Europe, you're expecting it to have a dub right. Unfortunately that didn't happen. It wasn't until 2017, when out of nowhere, Funimation released Gosick on DVD with an English dub. The dub features a variety of actors. Newcomers like Apphia Yu (Victorique) and  Matt Shipman (Kujou); veterans like Robert McCollum (Brian) and David Wald (Marquis); and finally people who don't often do Funimation roles like Erica Mendez (Avril). Was the dub good? It was okay. Not the worst, but not the best either. It would be interesting if they were given accents but I think it's best if they don't. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Gosick is a nice historical mystery anime with great mysteries, nice art style and music. Although the characters can be very forgettable. Except for Victorique who is the best tsundere ever (no offense Taiga and Shana). If you like a great detective anime with a great female protagonist, and is not as long as Detective Conan, then Gosick is a good choice.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n+ Good mysteries that can make one big story\\n\r\n+ Everything about Victorique\\n\r\n+ Art and music is nice\\n\r\n+ An okay dub\\n\r\n+ A good ending for once\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- Most characters are forgettable\\n\r\n- The first 2 mysteries unconnected to the main story for the most part\\n\r\n- Is it Seville or Saubure? I need to know!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall Grade: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the case here is done...\\n",

            "content": "Gosick\u2019s greatest strength lies within the fact that it manages to catch you off guard. I mean, look at it: a mystery series featuring a (gothic?) loli detective and a typical transfer student with a terribly vacant face? What can go right with such a premise? Well, Gosick proves that quite a lot can.\r\n-- Story --\r\nThe story of Gosick starts off in a quite faithful-to-its-premise way \u2014 and by that I mean in a rather lame way. Kujo, our typical dull main character has just transferred to a school in a fictional spooky European country where he meets Victorique, our second main character and, inhindsight, a typical tsundere. He then begins stumbling upon various unsolved, mysterious cases, often because he's rather dumb and naive, which greatly interest Victorique because she's really, really bored chilling out in her vast library all the time.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the series follows a simple format: each case takes up two to three episodes to solve, with the occasional transitioning episode before the next case appears. The cases themselves are fairly interesting but also quite easy to figure out at first, which isn't a bad thing by default. The problem is that there's an issue in the way they are executed. Sometimes Victorique comes to convenient conclusions that may be obvious from her perspective, but due to lack of information given to the audience, she appears to be performing some giant leaps in logic. There are even a few times that her reasoning is a bit too far-fetched, but it just so happens that the odds are in her favor and so she ends up being correct anyway.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, not only do the complexity and execution of the cases get progressively better \u2014 with some of them ending up being pretty good, frankly \u2014 but as the story unfolds, you begin to realize that all of them were hints to or puzzle pieces of a greater, underlying plot line. All mysteries presented to us from the beginning are either loosely or strongly connected to each other, and they either serve as world-building tools or pieces of the actual story. In short, Gosick isn't a detective show per se but a political show that uses the detective bits as a means to introduce the viewer into the background political scene. \\n\\n\r\nThat is the aspect where Gosick shines the brightest. The fictional world and underlying political mystery is interesting, rather original, and taps into quite a few good themes relevant to real history. In this regard, the writers also do a good job with the execution and the layout of the mystery itself, as the viewer has to piece together all the information scattered around the individual cases. Parts that seemed unimportant or confusing at first are later revealed to be crucial and well thought-out. The true focus of Gosick's story isn't very forgiving to viewers who failed to pay close attention, and that, in my eyes, is undoubtedly a positive.\\n\\n\r\n-- Characters -- \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Gosick follow a pattern of negative and positive aspects similarly to the story, but taken to an extreme. The staff of Gosick somehow manages to be both shamelessly awful and surprisingly good when it comes to writing characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs aforementioned, our two main characters, Kujo and Victorique, are simple stereotypes (although not the worst of their kinds). Kujo's defining traits are his unresolved inferiority complex, stupidity, naivety, not knowing when to back down, and turning the name \"Victorique\" into a nightmare for all of us with his constant insufferable yelling. Even though Kujo definitely wins the competition, Victorique isn't much better. Her defining traits are her intelligence, asocial behavior, and her often annoying, bossy attitude.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, I have to admit that Sakuraba Kazuki attempted to justify the protagonists being, for the most part, blunt stereotypes through their backstories, and I can say that the anime pulled a half-decent effort at that. However, while character development is not completely absent for either of them, the fact that they are so stereotypical, especially in Kujo's case, creates more of  an illusion of character development than genuine progress. I mean, the guy is a blank canvas; he can be painted any color you like, so it's inevitable he will appear to have developed in some way by the end of the series. In the end, although the inner conflicts of both Victorique and Kujo are there, their actions fail to truly push the boundaries of their respective archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the romantic relationship that develops between those two carries the same annoying attributes. It's so poorly demonstrated that I'm willing to bet many viewers will fail to realize that it is, in fact, contributing to the plot and it was quite necessary for it to progress. The romance mainly consists of Kujo trying to be chivalrous and sympathetic towards Victorique and then Victorique playing difficult and being stubborn. As a result, it manages to be either uninteresting or annoying because of how unoriginal it comes off as, even though it's actually a driving element in the story. This aside, I believe the show would benefit from it being less of a focus at times, as it often takes away from more interesting plot points and character interactions by overshadowing them.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, there's something that Gosick does pretty well: almost the entirety of its supporting cast. It's probably not a coincidence that the multi-dimensional and overall best written characters of this show are the ones more closely related to its underlying plot line. You'll meet a plethora of supporting characters \u2014 from government officials to police inspectors to simple aristocrats or outcasts \u2014 with clear, realistic motives, decently explored backgrounds and emotions, and strong personalities, who will truly carry the story of the series and act as a surprising breath of fresh air. Had the writers put the same amount of love and effort into the main cast as they did with the supporting cast, I'd be willing to even to forgive most of the story's flaws. I don't think anyone will be disappointed by most of the characters of Gosick \u2014 besides the two protagonists.\\n\\n\r\n-- Overall --\\n\\n\r\nGosick was an interesting watch for me, but this certainly won't be the case for others. Despite it starting off in a rather silly way, it proved to have enough substance for me to enjoy it. I imagine the Light Novels do a much better job at the individual cases, as well as fleshing out the characters, and they might be a better suited medium to enjoy this story. As for the anime, however, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's expecting to watch a romance or even a detective story. I'd recommend this series to people who are interested in political and historical mysteries/dramas, and more specifically to those with an abundance of patience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

            "content": "Gosick is an anime I had mixed feelings about throughout. In my opinion the best word to describe Gosick is uneven, as I find that applicable to just about every aspect of the show. Gosick was consistently good but never great and overall I watched a decent but flawed show that I enjoyed but wasn't blown away by.\r\nArt-\r\nThe art is crisp and consistent throughout the show with no episodes or sequences being blatantly ugly or blatantly gorgeous. It's generally pretty. Victorique is an attractive and unique character but almost everyone else is generic and forgettable. There are a few scenes, such as shots from aboveof the very large library and conservatory in which Victorique spends most of her time, in which you can tell the animators paid great attention to detail and put time into the shot, which was appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nSolid voice acting in the dub from both leads. Neither delivers an outstanding performance, but both are definitely a cut above the norm. So few supporting characters are actually important in this show that no one really stands out (and wouldn't stand out unless their performance was extremely good or extremely crappy), but I have no qualms with the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is strong for sure with a couple of legitimate standouts, my personal favorite being \"Honrou no Naka no Seimei\", which I have on my playlist. Each song is individually nice without a doubt, but I would fault the soundtrack in that songs get reused multiple times and it does get noticeably repetitive by the time you reach the latter part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the intro and outro sequence were above average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Story-\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very imbalanced and uneven. It has three separate and unique entities in play- the \"girl detective\" plot, the romantic plot and the political plot. Yes, they're all connected, but they're not developed anywhere near evenly. The detective stuff dominates the first half or more of the show and becomes a bit repetitive and tiresome, especially when the same generic statement- Victorique knows absolutely everything down to the tiniest details and is never ever wrong, period- can be applied to every single situation. \\n\\n\r\nThe romantic plot is the one of the three they did the best job with as it was presented early enough on for the viewer to be invested and it progressed in a realistic and believable way without being over the top or ever approaching fan service/hentai territory.\\n\\n\r\nThe political plot was the weakest of the three as it was not delved into until far later in the show, at which point the viewer is far more invested in the detective and romantic elements, and it largely felt rushed and as though many details were not explained well if at all. The political plot was hard to follow and simply wasn't all that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that seems to happen often in anime is applicable here as well- the male \"main\" character, Kujo, is far less developed or interesting than his female counterpart, Victorique, who is clearly the true main character. He's the generic likable, non-aggressive, nice guy who you've seen in many other anime and is ultimately forgettable. Victorique, on the other hand, is far and away the most memorable character in the show and is very quirky. I had mixed feelings about the character as a whole, as she spends the first half or more of the show being more or less a giant bitch, but she's clearly intended to be likable even if she's a massive pain in the ass.\\n\\n\r\nAs an in general statement, the quality and interest level of the show dipped up and down a lot. There were stretches of 2-3 episodes that felt like an 8 and were engaging and interesting. There were other stretches of 2-3 episodes that felt closer to a 5, dragged and were approaching the territory of slow and boring. This pattern continued throughout the show. It definitely felt like there were some filler-ish parts and that those moments could have been better utilized filling in some of the blanks the show never gets around to explaining. Lack of explanation definitely plagues this show in multiple areas.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nAs stated above, my enjoyment when watching Gosick was uneven, with certain stretches feeling like an 8 and other stretches feeling like a 5 or a 6. The quality and engagement level of the episodes and mini arcs definitely varied. My overall feeling at the end of the show was that it was pretty good but never great and while I'm glad I watched it and would be open to watching it again down the road, I don't see it as essential viewing or something I'd be truly missing out on had I never seen it at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending felt rushed and it was really safe, predictable and cliche. I was moderately satisfied with it I guess, but I wasn't blown away. Basically when all was said and done I shrugged and said to myself \"that was pretty good I guess\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nA show that isn't terrible at anything but isn't amazing at anything either. \"Jack of all trades, master of none\" as they say. Gosick is worth a watch but isn't without flaws such as unexplained plot elements, cliches, conveniences and uneven pacing. Also, it's not anywhere near as dark as some other reviews will lead you to believe. Come in with the right expectations and watch a decent show, but I don't see this ending up on most people's list of all time favorites.\\n\\n\r\n+Strong soundtrack\\n\r\n+Absence of fan service\\n\r\n+Quirky, memorable female lead\\n\\n\r\n-Repetitive\\n\r\n-Victorique knows every detail of every case, period, and is always right\\n\r\n-Uneven, both in its pacing and in its development of different aspects of the plot\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 7\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7",

            "content": "\"BIKTORIKAAAA\"\r\n[Pre-Review Comments]\r\n\"Gosick\", a story set in the fictional country of Sauville during the post-Great War era, tells the tale of two students and their misadventures solving some of the country's greatest mysteries.\r\nI enjoyed this anime in quite a few ways. Though, despite its intriguing storyline and setting, \"Gosick\" is not without a considerable amount of flaws.\r\n[Story] 7/10\r\nI was in love with this anime for the entirety of its first half. The story felt both unique and familiar at the same time, bringing about memories of watching mystery/crime shows as a kid. The plot seemed to do very well of creating interesting and genuinely surprising scenariosbased around Kujo and Victorique's chemistry. Despite this, by the end of the show my overall feelings for the story were bordering \"meh\".\\n\\n\r\nRoughly halfway through, Victorique's father, the Marquis de Blois is introduced as a character, and primary protagonist. After that point, the entire show seemed to spiral downhill in terms of consistency and strength, leaving behind a tangled mess of nonsense and cheap plot devices. It just felt like the writers were piling on far too much information and references to former episodes than it could handle.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, though I enjoyed the first half of Gosick, the second portion/ending just seemed to leave a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's not a lot I can really say about the artwork. It's about average, nothing in particular stands out among other animes of the same time period. However, it's decent enough; therefore, I'll be giving it a score of \"good\".\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 6/10\\n\\n\r\nGosick's soundtrack was not a very memorable one, for me at least. I was not a big fan of the intro/closing sequences either, providing my overall score of 6/10.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis score is heavily based off of Victorique's character. She, in essence carries the entire show; the entire overarching plot is based around her after all. To me, she was one of the few genuinely interesting characters in this show, despite its large amount of supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nKujo on the other hand... well, he's Kujo. Basically what you would expect for a generic male protagonist. Japanese, dark hair, neutral characteristics, designed to protect the female lead. His character showed hardly any exception to the norm, which somewhat disappointed me. Oh, also, did he really have to yell \"BIKTORIKAAAA! VEKTOREKAAAA\" about 5 times in the same sentence, every time he saw her? Probably not.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the supporting characters felt somewhat \"expendable\", and are designed for one specific purpose. Victorique's brother, \"The Inspector\" was clearly brought in to add a bit of flair to the series, however I was disappointed with what they did to his character in the end. Overall, I'd say (thanks to Victorique) the characters deserve an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, despite its flaws I had fun with this anime. It kept me entertained from beginning to end, and there isn't much I can argue about that. I'd say it's a pleasant addition to the mystery genre for that matter.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite my overall enjoyment, there were many negative aspects which I simply could not ignore. I think 7/10 is a score which best expresses my feelings for this anime.\\n",

So here i go.\r\nIv'e got to say the story was amazing! the first episode really drew me in. I am a real sucker for anything historical so this was a huge plus. The story has had something that is different from others it can be go from being dark to having a laugh once in a while. Because of that its real addicting. It might look like your general mystery anime but its much more than that, it shows delevelopment ofthe story very smoothly without rush, and so much thrill with the main character mystery solving. The art is what drew me in the anime in the first place, at first i read the plot and decided not to watch it, but the style was very unique so i watched it anyway. But gosh! the art was so beautiful and yet so simple it captures your eyes from the characters to the whole scenario around the school and town. Really, the art is the biggest plus for me. The chracter development was really good in this one, improvements in victorique and kujo, at first it seemed she was very suspicious of kujo. But after a while time spending more time together they grew very close and changes her demeanor all together.",

            "content": "I guess you can say that it's a plus point nowadays whenever you have a DFC as your main character. At the time of its airing, I can surely feel a great tremble as thousands if not millions of lolicons around the world start jumping up and down for Victorique.\r\nBut that's not the point, the point here is that as a person who despises most DFCs in anime (because they are stereotypically made up of being 100% tsundere, like Shana and Louise), I came to love Gosick and even, while still not a lolicon, Victorique.\r\nThe instant effect Gosick had on me was the beauty ofits art when Kujo entered the tower/library Victorique resides in. A beautifully drawn garden where a small piece of Heaven seems to take residence in. Oh and that piece of Heaven is Victorique. She captivated me with the stern look she had as well the elegance of her long blonde hair, perfected with the matchup of her dark clothes that gives off an aura of...adventure should I say?\\n\\n\r\nThe conversations between the two were also captivating. The cryptic way in which Victorique speaks just thrills me further on what this girl, barely adolescent in looks yet wise in manner, has to deliver. Kujo on the other hand seemed pretty stereotypical of most male protagonists nowadays, however the match-up seems to not make it dull.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the other guy, that blonde dude with a Giga Drill Breaker hairstyle. Annoying as he may be (animes have party pooper characters more than 50% of the time), his mannerism of speech and flamboyant body language also does the series a goodjob by balancing whimsicality with profundity. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors range from being \"ok\" to \"nice fit\". Victorique's being undoubtedly the best suited, sounding like a \"grandma who has lived through the ages\" and \"little princess\" at the same time. Kujo's is well, typical. Sort of like how you'd expect Shirou Emiya/Sakai Yuuji etc to have already sounded like from the get-go. Other characters are yet to be shown so I'll just leave it at that, but the main point being the quality of Victorique's.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now of course, the bread and butter of why reviews are important anyway, the story of the show. Though I must admit that upon first reading of the summary, I was rather doubtful about the overall delivery of the anime. Simply put, it was another \"boy meets girl\", or at least the summary says so. Still, the first episode did very well to negate the overusage of such a prologue by giving us a mystery to solve. By that time, Gosick already shattered all the assumptions I made about the show (mostly revolving around the \"boy meets girl\" archetype, and the lead is a DFC, go figure). \\n\\n\r\nThe crime solving part lets out the best of the lovely Victorique, that's when you really see her get into action as well as obliterating every single stereotype used to describe her. The last time I watched an anime that asked to solve mysteries, it was Umineko, and my did that disappoint (Battler is batshit for a protagonist). Gosick does it really well, at least so far it has. Deductive logic coupled with critical thinking, yummy.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with all this praise about Gosick, I can only give the story a 7 because I'm not for certain about the mysteries part yet. Think of it as this way, if you look at Gosick as being a sliced cake (the slices being \"arcs\"), yes, it MAY be an awesome anime with food for thought during each separate slice. However, if you were to look at Gosick as a whole cake itself, it is what it is - boy meets girl, slice of life anime. Since spoiler aren't allowed, I'll just leave a message here saying that the episode preview of episode 4 sort of foreshadows the latter perspective of Gosick.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, regardless of how you look at it however, the enjoyment you derive from Gosick should be pretty consistent throughout. The art shows sign of consistency as well as the character development. A definite pickup, if I may so put it.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Having just watched Episode 4, I'm happy to say that the underlying assumption that I brought forward has been gleefully shattered.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's momentum is still maintained, and I'll be happy that it continues that way. The development on Victorique's part is intensifying. Oh my this is good.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: After transferring to St. Marguerite Academy in Sauville, Kujo Kazuya (Eguchi, Takuya) chances upon a small, golden haired girl named Victorique (Yuuki, Aoi) at the top of the school's library. Arrogant, eccentric, and possessing a genius level intellect, Victorique helps Kujo unravel the mysteries of the school and Sauviille in order to sate her boredom and inquisitiveness. Together, the two unearth the country's strange histories and folktales and learn of Victorique's complicated past and heritage.\r\n[Characters]:\r\nGosick has a decently sized cast of characters and while the bulk of them are introduced and forgotten within their respective miniarcs, there are around a dozen recurring characters of some import which helped the show feel more familiar throughout its sometimes less relevant stories.\\n\\n\r\nThe male lead and protagonist, Kujo, struck me as a pretty vanilla character and while he had a few positive attributes he didn't do much to separate himself or stand out even amongst the cast. His best quality is his endearing attitude towards Victorique however he is also the unfortunate subject of one of the few problems of the show. He does not come off as a particuarly intellegent character to begin with and often makes some unintelligent decisions because of this however his stupidity is unfairly exagurated because of the show's often simplsitc mysteries. While it is a problem in and of itself that the mysteries are sometimes very simple, having Kujo always be the one who Victorique explains things to and having him be surprised each time in order to capture the reveal dumbs down the character considerably due to no fault of his own.\\n\\n\r\nVitorique is a much stronger character than Kujo in my opinion and has a fair amount of well-executed and believeble development throughout the show. She starts off quite thorny and her arrogance and classic Tsundere demeanor make her less than enjoyable however, as a starting point, she progresses a good deal beyond this in several ways and her growth is perhaps the best part of her dynamic with Kujo. Her intelligence is also sometimes wasted on the show's occasionally lackluster mysteries however it feels good to have a character who is on top of things and she will sometimes reveal something that is genuinely interesting. I was also surprised by how she acted, even initially - typically her arrogant brilliance along with her Tsundere qualities would dictate that she rarely lose composure and always be in control however these traits are very quickly undermined in the exploration of the first mystery and she feels like a far more complex and complete character because of these variances.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is fairly strong overall with some exceptions here and there. Avril Bradley in particular struck me as somewhat of a superfluous character as her legitimacy as a romantic interest was poor at best and she never grew beyond that trait. I found all of the characters involved in Victorique's past highly compelling and their recurring rolls were part of what gave the second half of the show its strength.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was quite good and never showed any notable reduction in quality. The strongest point concerning the show's art was definitely its ability to control the atmosphere and present a consistent and comfortable image of the 1920's; despite the gothic influence . The character designs are fairly reserved with the exception of Grevil however as backstory is provided for his outlandish appearance the aesthetic feels at home albeit different from those that surround him. The animation was occasionally interesting and sometimes delivered a scene particularly well however for the most part it simply did its job - the motion of things felt at home within the world.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with a series of somewhat formulaic mini arcs after we are introduced to the main duo of characters and the few mainstays at St. Marguerite Academy. These short mystery stories help establish the tone of the show quite well and are each enjoyable however they come with their share of negatives as well. At least in the early parts of the show, Gosick had a bad habit of over-involving people in it's mysteries - in linking clues and evidence in order to get to the bottom of the story, a single, newly introduced character or a single story element would often act as a magnet for the evidence and somehow everything the story had drudged up would relate to them despite seeming unbelievable. This wasn't a huge problem for the show and it quickly grew beyond this however there were a few more issues with the formulaic mystery approach.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem that really bugged me was the way the show would introduce the mystery - a folktale, ghost story, or legend would always come up in complete isolation from the actual events of the episode before being brought together to form the mystery itself. It is all well and good that Sauville is rich in its history of urban legends and horror stories and thematically, the way the show ties these together in the later parts, it is a strong part of the show however the way it initially uses these things to introduce the mini arcs felt frustratingly coincidental. The way that the characters would suddenly come into possession of a certain book or a story just as the very same mystery began to unfold elsewhere and separately was almost laughably painful to watch and one of the cornier parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMy last negative comment concerning the mysteries of the show has to do with the simplicity of the mysteries themselves. A popular dynamic of the mystery show is to provide actual evidence that allows the viewer to follow along and often solve the puzzle themselves before the characters arrive at their own conclusion and this has been done in the past with varying degrees of success however Gosick somewhat messes up during this process. It allows for a good deal of dramatic irony in that the viewer knows a great deal of whats going on and can reach a proper conclusion sometimes a great deal before Victorique decides to reveal the whole of the story however this is done in such a way that by the time she begins to explain things, it feels like she is revealing very matter of fact and obvious things in a revolutionary fashion as Kujo reacts surprisingly - the way in which some of the mysteries are laid out somewhat cheapens Victorique's brilliance and unfairly accentuates Kujo's foolishness.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of that aside, the story begins growing more self-referential after a time and the mysteries begin weaving together to form a more grand picture - one more compelling than any of the individual stories beforehand in my opinion. We get some insight into Victorique's past in the first half of the show however it becomes much more central in the second half and things grow thematically much darker which I think worked well for the show. In this way, the show, which was not unenjoyable to begin with, got progressively better as it continued on. The show began relying less and less on the individual mysteries it had started with and aimed to execute a greater narrative that tied everything in the show together which I found to be a pleasurable manner of progression. The ending unfortunately felt a little rushed and not everything was explained in crystal clear detail however the content of the ending was quite good and very enjoyable despite its somewhat hasty delivery. The story, while lackluster in some regards, was the strongest part of Gosick.  \\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nGiven the setting and tone of the show I was surprised at how involved and epic the music sometimes got. The soundtrack did very well in emphasizing moments of tension and drama and only occasionally did I feel the song was oddly juxtaposed to the scene - sometimes the formidable score seemed over-dramatic for the situation however very infrequently. The music was fun, had plenty of time in the spotlight, and was a positive addition to the show overall.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nGosick may have had it's ups and downs however I think it was ultimately pretty good despite its negative aspects. It was easy to get into because it launched right into its first mystery almost immediately after introducing a few characters and so I was glad to be spared the typical school setting at least initially and the quick beginning gave me a sense for the tone of the show from the get go which I found effective. The ending was definitely rushed and if I could change one major thing about the plot then I would have given the end of the story a bit more room to breathe however I think it was a decent trade overall as the show ended quite strongly and in a memorable way.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7\\n\\n\r\nI gave Gosick a 7 because, while some of its early content may have felt over-coincidental and a little predictable, the show grew into something more elaborate over time and the characters became more endearing and complex as time went on. It's simple approach as well as some of its cruder story elements held it back a bit however the end result was quite pleasing and a few of the characters like Victorique surprised me with their uniqueness and kept the show consistently fresh. Lastly, I think one of the most fun elements of the show was how it began tying previously individual elements together and while some of these things felt a little forced I think the idea itself was good.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show might have stumbled a couple times in the design of its mysteries they were still enjoyable and the show is definitely a mystery show first and foremost. It was a pretty decent romance however it didn't spend as much time on the romantic aspect of things like a true romance show might and so its content here might be a little light. The drama of the show is probably its best executed element and so I would recommend it for that reason as well - the show's later half becomes far more interesting in this regard and so if one finds themselves engaged with the story and the characters early on, then they are in for a good time.",

            "content": "The detective mystery solving genre was always popular, so captivating and involving, ever since the masterpiece of the 66 detective novels by Agatha Christie. Japan too had adapted this storytelling concept and produced some of the finest detective stories as well in form of Manga and Anime alike, for instance, Detective Conan. Gosick is by no mean a first and above all others, but it had a unique take on the genre by being heavily influenced by supernaturalism in a desperate attempt to come up with something original and complex enough to let you \u201cwow\u201d after a case has been solved, but the thing is,it works, however, it also comes at a dear price.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\\n\r\nKazuya Kujou, an oriental exchange student comes to Sauville, a fictional country in Europe in order to follow up his studies. Turns out he found himself in a completely new world, a world very different than where he comes from by more than the color of hair and eyes, a country very reliant and famous for its fables and mysterious tragedies, among them, the golden fairy that resides at the top of a tower. Enter Victorique, a short loli looking doll-faced sweet lover, a first-degree expert at bad mouthing other people. Have it be a murder, impersonation or a hoax, the duo strives to solve the mystery around every famous case by the request of the local investigation bureau. But the show is more than a sequence of cases that needs to be solved, but down the line, all of those cases become to be unraveled as only preparations leading to an even greater case of murder that could shake the whole country, and as consequence, the stability of the great powers in Europe.\\n\r\nI personally find most of the riddles very interesting, and another case relates to a prior one was just too satisfying to realize. I also appreciate the minimalistic amount of flashbacks, as the ones we've got were more than enough to keep the pace up of what's currently happening.\\n\r\nHowever, there was still something up there that didn't feel quite right. Because of the linear nature of the storytelling, sometimes the mystery being solved is either predictable, too obvious, or just interesting to follow up.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\\n\r\nLet's talk about the producing studio for starters. Studio bones, if that doesn't ring any bell, it's the same studio that did Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Noragami, Mob Psycho 100, Boku no Hero Academia...\\n\r\nJust so you know what you're getting because if that wasn't enough already, I can assure you, the quality of the animation remained consistent throughout the whole series and managed to keep up the quality up to today's standards. The fighting scenes? there isn't a lot, but the one we've got was enough to make your eye capture as much of that sweetness as a Sharingan can.\\n\r\nAs a generalization, the art style feels very average and a bit cartoonish, something between Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and Little Witch Academia. Which in my opinion was great to capture the atmosphere of the portrayed era, between the two world wars, a time of the great shift from the occult to science.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\\n\r\nAoi Yuuki (Tsuyu from My Hero Academia, Tatsumaki from One Punch Man) and Takuya Eguchi (Shinji from Koruko no Basket, Nero from 91 Days), need I say more? There may not be the biggest voice actors out there, but if you know those characters, you know how amazing their acting blends with a role. People would point their fingers at Kujou saying he's annoying, talks too much, but that was the point, he's a naive 15 years old dude in a foreign land, he questions anything new he sees and quibbles with how different things are dealt with there. And then comes Victorique with a delicate tone of voice, as golden as her hair and as fragile as her physic, you just can't deny the cuteness sometimes. I'm serious when I say, they must really love what they were doing, the effort is obviously noticeable in their performance, like when Victorique cries, it gives you chills down your spine as if somebody was genuinely crying.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\\n\r\nAside from Victorique, there wasn't any figure on two legs that stood out much, Victorique was more than a main piece in the show, she was the center of her universe, but her beauty and brain, everybody else paled in comparison, but that doesn't mean they acted like soulless Americans, most of them were interesting in their own, like Brain, and Cordelia, Albert and so on. Victorique has had a great character development, she went from the shy unsocial unfriendly fairy to a very appreciative person, but not much can be said about Kujou, he kept a steady nagging through the run screaming \u201cVictorique\u201d at least 20 times each episode.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\\n\r\nDetective stories are not precisely my cup of tea, but having a loli take charge of things is another thing. [title] gave me more than mystery solving pleasure, I had my share of shipping and comedy as well, for that, I'm very welcoming.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (8.0/10):\\n\r\nNow, this is definitely something I'd recommend, even for people that aren't into the detective genre for how much diversity it can develop. As long as you can remain focused and keep up with the mind trickery that is, the show will be worth it.",

            "content": "Anime review:-\r\nAnime:- Gosick\r\nGenre:- Supernatural/Mystery/Romance\r\nNumber of Episodes:-24\r\nRating:- Animation and Artwork-8/10, Music:-8.5/10, Voice Acting:-7/10, Story-8/10, Coherence-7/10, Characters-6/10, Enjoyment-9/10(53.5/70)\r\nTo review Gosick is a really tough job. This anime has so many things going right for it and the fact that yet it fails to satisfy is what makes it so difficult. I would not go so far as to call this anime the anime of two halves but from the time the anime changed its ED it lost its charm. Let us talk about the positives first and then we will try to figure out where it went wrong.\r\nThe artwork is really nice for the setting in early1900s. Its nice to see all those horse drawn carriages and the different dressing sense of people of that era. One thing striking is the Japanese still wore kimono in that era whereas the Europeans had a distinctly different dress sense. The animation is nice too, par for the course for a 2010 anime, nothing to spectacular but does its work.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is really good, it has a light ring to it and sets you up nicely. But whats really good is the first ED. It has taken its place among my favourite Eds and perfectly matches with the tone of the show. Its really a shame that they had to change it and I didnt like the second ED as much. In anime music was nothing spectacular so I had to give an average score. The voice acting however was really average. It doesnt really bring out the characters and feels just vanishes into the countless ordinary voice acting of various anime you have watched. You dont remember much of the dialogues after you complete the anime, thats as much a fault of script as the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nThe story had a tremendous amount of promise. It starts of episodic or 2-3 episodes together in a story. Initially it feels like a detective mystery anime. It would have been good if it had stayed so. But the author had other ideas, linking the female protagonist to a dark and oppressed past is okay if you have a good story to back it up. The author actually tried to. Linking the world wars to the main storyline was a wonderful idea. Some of the cases had WW I linked with it too. An oppressed mother was also there to support the story to boot, with a travelling magician helping her and stuff. \u201cThe eternal love of the mother for her child with her making the final sacrifice to save her child\u201d idea was there as well. There was a nice little romance between the main characters. The cases were presented in a way in which the viewer can solve them if he thought hard enough all the clues were there. So you could think with the show. I mean all this essentially is the formula for a really great show and for the first 13 episodes I could not understand how it can go wrong. Well, for the last 13 episodes too I could not understand how it went wrong but I will try my best to figure out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story lost its thrilling nature after episode 13. Episode 17 pissed me off. And yet there were flashes of previous brilliance scattered here and there in some of the episodes. The thing is  there are two ways to make someone look intelligent. Make him/her unbelievably intelligent and get an almost equally intelligent antagonist, or make him/her decently intelligent and surround him/her with dumb characters. Sadly Gosick does the latter. The male protagonist is as dumb and cheesy as they come. The ending dialogue of the anime is as cheesy as they come. These were two big flaws in the anime. Then, trying to mix up supernatural and logic leads to disastrous effects most of the time. Gosick is a living proof. Also initially starting off with an episodic tone and trying to \u201cincrease\u201d the number of episodes involved in those small stories is a nice idea but here they faltered somehow. They made terrible use of the characters they created. There is almost little to no character development of any of them, which results in little to no empathy at their deaths. The only good part was the mother-daughter bonding and the rest somehow left very little mark though all the ingredients were there. So in the end the problem with this one would be wasting the potential of a great cast of characters, losing the thrilling nature of the first half by trying too much which draws the viewer and cheesy script writing. Yes that should do it.\\n\\n\r\nWell I wouldnt say I didnt enjoy the show but I hoped to enjoy it more.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:- Its a show that I would recommend if you like mystery which are solvable if you use your head, it wont mindfuck you but thats not a bad thing, also you might be left a little dissatisfied at the end with the show but you have to live with that. Its worth watching, its not a bad one.",

            "content": "Gosick, probably the best mystery anime out there until now, let me explain why. (Minor spoilers ahead)\r\nStory 10/10\r\nMystery anime are realy hard to pull off, why? Because Mystery only works on paper,thus Novels is the best way for Mystery, that's a fact and that's the reason Gosick was successful as a novel to the point Bones decided to adapt it. Now the reason story gets a perfect 10 is because, as the story goes on the cases our protagonists get into get harder,longer and towards the end some cases just leave you speechless. Another reason is that during the cases it portrays the early 20thcentury perfectly, all the prejuditions are displayed perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nNow for a short summary, protagonist Kujo Kazuya has moved to Sauvile from Japan to study abroad. Naturally his whole appearance seems weird to all the students there and because of his bad luck and his dark hair and eyes he is being called The Black Reaper that Comes on Spring and everyone avoids him.Having noone to talk to he heads to the library where he meets the female lead, Voctorique. After meeting her he is thrown in a series of cases making his reputation in school even worse so his only friend is Voctorique.Together they solve many cases while the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nFor 2011 the art is Great. Nothing to complain, Bones did a great job as always.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nSoundtracks being from the same person who did Code geass soundtracks was enough to let me know it was gonna be great, but this was exceptional. Both the openings/endings and the OSTs and inserted songs flow perfectly with the air of the anime and keep the gothic theme going, simply perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nNow comes the real reason the anime gets a perfect 10 from me. Gosick starts off as a typical Mr. Average meets Genius Loli who happens to be another tsundere. Let me tell you now, this is NOT the case for Gosick. As they solve more cases together they develop strong feelings of trust for each other and as the protagonist, Kujo, learns more about Voctorique's dark past he makes up his resolve to protect her to the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist Kujo, might look like Mr. Average but he is not, he will surprise you every time, he is just a 16 year old boy and yet even from the early episodes he is fearless when it is to protect Voctorique, example: fighting a murderer holding a huge ass axe with his bare hands.\\n\\n\r\nNow for Voctorique, she starts off as a tsundere genius who sees Kujo as a servant and nothing more, as the story progresses and Kujo protects her with his life countless times even if she herself says that someone like her doesn't deserve it she warms up to him and cannot live without him\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, character developement is the most striking point of Gosick. The relationship between the protagonists starts from Master-Servant then becomes Pure Friendship and Partners and finally...Romance.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nTo watch and enjoy Gosick to its fullest you must go in with the right mindset and expectations. If you expect something light and enjoyable then no, you will not enjoy this. Comedy is there and it's pretty good but Dark is the theme of this. There are a lot of deaths,hardships,dark pasts revealed and even gore,nothing much but it's still there. To people that are really into Mystery anime I promise you this is your cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nIt's a masterpiece in my opinion, anyone can enjoy it as long as they dont have the wrong expectations, the best thing about it is that most of the time even if you guess who the Culprit of a case is, the actual ENDING of a case will always surprise you to no end, especially episodes 10-20, expect a lot of mystery there, I was completely taken back on one of the cases when i was sure who the culprit was and I was right, but when they showed exactly WHAT happened I was just speechless, you cannot guess some of the cases no matter how much you think about it\\n\\n\r\nRecommending it to everyone, this is too good to not be watched from many people. Thanks for Reading",

            "content": "You know that feeling you get when you're just happy to be alive?  That's the feeling the author of this series is trying to get across and the impression that's left on me after having finished it.  Throughout the entire story, I was never bored but not particularly surprised either.  Each character made great impressions on me and I enjoyed them all.\r\nThat's not to say that Gosick is without faults.  Let me lay this out.\r\nMusic \u2013 This is the worst area for Gosick.  The lackluster opening and ending songs were ok at best and downright sappy at worst.  Thesoundtrack throughout the rest of the series was, however, right where it should have been: in the background.  It wasn't bad or anything of the sort.  It fit the mood just fine and didn't stick out in any way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 This is a relatively strong area but still weaker than others.  Kujo, our main hero, is a bit of a loser-kun when he first appears.  As a loser-kun, he is destined for abuse from everybody he meets and is destined to be a doormat for about half of the series.  However, unlike other loser-kuns, Kujo grows out of it.  Victorique is really a snob.  I suppose she technically fits the archetype of Tsundere but ultimately is too weak physically to pull it off well.  This ends up meaning Kujo has to be the manly man in spite of his loser-kun status.  However, much like Kujo, Victorique ends up growing out of her tsundere status as well.   Everybody else fits well around the relationship between these two and each plays their own, supporting role very well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \u2013 Here's an area where this anime shines.  This series is drawn very well.  I'd suggest that the attention to detail is above and beyond what is normal in any anime series.  The stylistic choices seemed spot on for the setting as well as the character tastes within that setting.  The very last episode is a fantastic example of this with Victorique sporting late 20's-style Japanese clothing.  In the opinion of this author, there weren't any artfully distasteful choices at any point in the series.  The animators and directors demonstrated real class throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 This was not really a mystery.  For those of you looking for a straight-up, old-school mystery you should give up.  The mysteries in this were mildly obscured at best.  So then, why do I rate this story so highly if I am saying this?  The story is an amazing experience.  It isn't about the mystery at all.  Rather, it's about this odd couple and the environment around them.  How does the world change so vastly and work so heard to tear them apart?  There were times where I thought one of them was going to die.  The story took some rather dark turns at times and that left you wondering what was going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series, because of its incredible story, endearing characters, and it's full environment; because it reaches out to you and pulls you in so effectively and keeps you there and, sometimes, at the edge of your seat, I am giving this series a 9.5 out of 10.  Gosick, you're a treasure.",

            "content": "This review is by no means a work of an expert and should not be taken as one. This review is made by an average viewer that is considerate to the average viewer rather than critics that are bluntly critical about absurd things that most people don't care about. (Some Spoilers, I tried to reduced the amount of spoilers just in case someone is just looking for an anime to watch and skimming reviews)\r\nGosick in a nutshell: ghost stories, urban legends, master detective, love triangle, and tsundere lolicon. \r\nStory (6/10) - Well I'll admit that I did initially enjoy the story I later found thatoutside the ghost stories/legends it was rather repetitive and boring. The problem with this series is the main female protagonist Victorique. Now I understand that they explain that her race (Gray Wolves) is renowned for their intellect, but because of this she is hardly faced with any kind of challenge. If there was a case that needed to be solved she would be able to solve it if the right clues were present, and they always turn up usually with the help of Kujou (the main male protagonist). As for the love triangle it's nothing special, textbook and predictable. The only reason why Kujou and Victorique's relationship grew is because Kujou is feared and has very few friends (4 if I recall towards the end) and Victorique gets bored and uses Kujou, nothing special. The ending is blah... I'm just content that they ended the series. The last arc was the best part because things were finally coming together and making sense. As for the very end I thought it heavily brought down the last arc, because it's basically your cop-out happy ending (it's really up to the viewer also I personally didn't like how they ruined Victorique's loli appeal). Also keep in mind that an anime with an end is like a luxury because some anime that desperately need one don't or won't have one (School Rumble; although I read School Rumble Z and was content that they had ended it, but some viewers won't go as far as reading the manga leaving casual anime viewers clueless). \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) - Looks good, the average viewer probably wouldn't notice the details of the Victorique's clothes, background inconsistencies, average forgettable faces of minor characters, accuracy of the Victorian period art, and also its Gothic atmosphere. The intro I think is a bit too colorful for an anime with a pretty good Gothic vibe, but meh I just skip it or walk away till I hear the opening song ending. The outro is more appropriate. Not too many people pay too close attention to intro/outro so points were deducted for such reasons. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10) - Aside from the pretty upbeat tempo of the intro, everything seems to fit. Unless the viewer has a keen ear for Japanese acting, they won't really notice the over/underacting that was done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10) - The two main characters are pretty bland nothing too innovative, although Victorique's redeeming quailty is her back story. There are also other characters with decent back stories. I just had a problem with Victorique, and how she was always able to solve everything. As for her logic behind her reasoning and conclusion for each case the audience has to accept that it was said and done regardless of whether its factual or not.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (6/10) - It's not bad, like I mentioned before outside the ghost stories/urban legends it's pretty repetitive and boring. Initially it was very interesting, I was actually getting into it and then I realized that I was able to predict the outcome (case presented, find all clues, gather party involved, reveal logic and reason, case closed; basically like most detective stories). In the end I just watched it because of the ghost stories/urban legends. Though I think others will enjoy it more than I did.",

            "content": "Few anime ever reach to a whole new level. Most anime are fillers and very few of them ever make their own mark. Gosick is one of those few.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nA completely original anime story? That's impossible! You would say, but yes, Gosick has a very unique outlook on and story while also adding a bit of real life situations (war) mixed into it. The story starts slow, very slow actually but ends in such a strong note that it eradicated any minor errors during the course of the anime. I for one, have never seen an ending so strong as Gosick. Most anime start strongor continue strong but usually mess up the ending. Gosikc is the opposite. It's story was never boring and always captivated me each time I watched an episode. Originality and Captivity are the absolute strongholds of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBones did a pretty okay job in terms of the looks of the anime. It has a pretty dark tone with dark palettes which make sense for a mystery anime but it's also a problem in itself. The 'happy' moments seem rather drab and messed up due to the darker colors used mixed with the bright emotions of the characters throughout the course of the anime...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only memorable OP/ED was the 2nd ED from a personal opinion. None of the other ones (even the never-changed OP) could come to it's level. In terms of BGM, I found it rather forgettable. The BGM wasn't the stronghold of this anime unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA mystery anime rarely focuses on character development and focusses more on the story part or rather the mystery part of the anime. But Gosick did a brilliant job with the characters too.\\n\\n\r\nVictorique: The 'Holmes' of this anime, Victorique needs few hints to solve a major mystery and may look like she is good at everything. But she is also bad at many things too. Anime usually intends to show it the positives of characters more than negatives, and especially in mystery anime it makes the MC look 'Perfect'. Gosick does otherwise, it evened out the good and the bad of our lovely MC Victorique and clearly shows *why* she had feelings for Kujo. Best of all is her performance in the last arc, which cemented this anime as one of the best of 2011.\\n\\n\r\nKujo: The 'Watson' of this anime, Kujo is an exchange student who finds Victorique at the top of the library and their relationship hits off immediately. Kujo, like Victorique develops wonderfully in character during the anime going from a quiet to outgoing personality. He develops another important quality of being able to solve a few things in his own, but I'd not like to delve into the spoiler category so I'll end it here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGosick was a very fun and intriguing anime for a mostly Romance anime watcher like me (89% RomCom) . It kept me in suspense (*not* the suspense of a confession mind you) and kept me hooked till the end. Perhaps it'll take me a few months or maybe years to find an anime that's as enjoyable as well as unique as Gosick. The only anime I've watched that was maybe in par with Gosick was The Pet Girl of Sakurasou as that had very similar elements (namely emotions) to Gosick.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGosick is a perfect cross between Romance and Mystery. Although the Romance is noticeably less (maybe non-Rimance watchers wouldn't notice *anything* till the last arc) the Mystery part left me satisfied and wanting for more. A perfect go-to for Mystery watchers and Romance watchers wanting something different too!\\n\\n\r\nP.S Meanwhile I'll look for some sweets myself before some short blonde girl demands them and takes them away from me.",

            "content": "\u30b4\u30b7 \u30c3 \u30af- Gosick is a successful, self-developing crime story in the charming nostalgic atmosphere of the early 20th century that evolves with each new episode. The short stories always contain a mysterious element and from time to time many small humorous scenes. The fact that the ascending drama element is elegantly woven into the romanticism is particularly sophisticated.\r\nWe accompany on the hunt for the truth Victorique de Blois and Kazuya Kujo and cut through a network of lies, Intrigues and secrets in the fictional Kingdom of Sovurien (\"Sauville\"), which shows a slight touch of French flair and elegance. The little secrets are exciting, evenif the solutions or the manner, how these will be resolved, not always entirely convince. The pipe, which Victorique again and again has to hand and her cute sentence about \u201creconstruct the fragments of chaos by the use of the wellspring of wisdom\u201d, is a cute comedy touch and unmistakable homage to the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The author Sir A.C. Doyle described Sherlock Holmes deductive method as: \u201celiminate the impossible, what remains, however improbable it may seem, must be the truth \u201d (Sir A.C. Doyle, \u201cThe Sign of Four\u201d). The at first disjointed action cases add up to a whole. The further the plot progresses, the more the drama element rises towards its climax. The last episodes draw magically under their spell because well constructed and narrated convincingly although the actual final has been a bit quickly by the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters and their mindsets are done well particularly with a few rough edges as well as with different tastes and predilections. That way the dialogues are significantly enriched with linguistic humour that is based on the typically debates and the situation comedy which is characteristically for an Anime that involves the genres romance and comedy. The use of these RomCom-concept is handy because it frames the characters in a concrete and tangible way and that way allows the viewers to empathize with and to grasp them.\\n\\n\r\n*Description of the characters may contain spoilers so it might be better to watch the anime first*\\n\\n\r\nVictorique de Blois:\\n\r\nVictorique is a gifted young girl with a pretty doll-like appearance, but a traumatic childhood, isolated and imprisoned with books only, formed her as a well-read shell. However her character is more than just a Loli in beautiful dresses and especially her development is described convincingly and undoubtedly well worth seeing.\\n\r\nKazuya Kujo:\\n\r\nBecause of his appearance with dark complexion, hair and eyes, Kujo gets the nickname \"kuroi shinigami\" and is shunned at boarding Academy of Saint Marguerite. Kujo is intellectually inferior to Victorique in comparison, however, his gentle behaviour and friendly nature slowly but surely has an influence on the young girl.\\n\r\nIn case of the supporting characters, series with an episodic structure unfortunately have a problem to characterize those. In Gosick, however, it was managed good because given as much screen time or personality as possible to the side characters, to best suited to their needs so that even they are permitted to succeed. Grevil de Blois e.g. is a character, with potential who was sadly pushed initially in to the comedy corner but managed it to develop convincingly despite the comedy, till the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\n*Spoiler alert end*\\n\\n\r\nThe beautiful art of the original Light Novel illustrations by Takeda Hinata is reflected in a truly enchanting way in the adaptation. Gosick shows a really good performance in terms of character designs and drawing style. Especially, impressive are the beautiful details which are highly visible for the most at the graceful and exquisite dresses of Victorique.  Also the backgrounds e.g. mountains, buildings, vehicles and facilities are very well done, but primarily the architecture of the towns appears in a unique visual aesthetic. The company Bones is already known for good animation series like Cowboy Bepop, FMA and many more. So it's not surprising that Gosick also offers a consistently high quality of art and animation, which are beautiful and fluid even in the action sequences. However, there are also aspects that should have been paid more attention. The adaptation of a Light Novel into an anime should be done very carefully and deliberately, especially with regard to the visualization of dialogues, gestures as well as the thoughts and feelings of the characters. Otherwise, the viewer may easily decipher the little secrets. In my opinion, this is also the reason why the small mysteries in Gosick are not entirely convincing.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM composed by Nakagawa, K\u014dtar\u014d is again very well done and underlines the atmosphere of the scenes very well. Nakagawa-san was already responsible for the melodies in productions like Code Geass,  and 07-Ghost, he knows how to emphasize the mood of the scenes. Not least for this reason, the good visual appearance of the anime merges with the graceful background music to a harmonious overall picture that convinces and pleases as well. \\n\r\nThe OP \"Destine Histoire\" is sung by Yoshiki Lisa, is a wonderful song and captivates beside the beautiful voice, with a very good selection of pictures for the background animation. \\n\r\nThe first ED \"Resuscitated Hope\" is presented by Komine Lisa. She has a graceful, classical sounding and very warm soft voice, which creates a cool feeling of aliveness with the modern rock music. In the long version of the song a nice guitar solo is included. This unusual end sequence is additionally emphasized by a beautiful but unusual picture design. The second ED \"\"unity\" is also sung by Komine Lisa, the style of the title is similar, although in this case it is more focused on the emphasis of the voice, so that a very graceful, classical-sounding closing melody is created. All in all a very fitting and beautiful end of the series.\\n\r\nThe seiy\u00fb work was very good, in particular the voices of Victorique, whose personality was expressed very well by Aoi Yuuki's voice, and Kazuya, who was very well spoken by Eguchi Takuya, even though I don't like much the sound of his voice. Among the side characters, I especially noticed the voice acting of Kiuchi Hidenobu as Grevil de Blois, because he managed to make the personality of the character audible. Last but not least, Sawashiro Miyuki as speaker for Cordelia Gallo convinced, because she was able to arouse the audience's feelings truly. On the other hand, in case of dialog-directing there was nothing outstanding, the dialogues felt rather too simple sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, Gosick convinces with a  marvelous visual and musical performance that establishes a wonderful atmosphere in the style of the early 20th century. The captivating story with numerous twists and turns and a high identification factor with the endearing main characters who are hunting for the truth in a logical puzzle and finally the detailed art and animation make Gosick a very enjoyable and adventurous detective anime. Even though other elements, such as a political intrigue takes place, the climax is still a beautiful, albeit slightly bitter-sweet love story with a successful, albeit not surprising end.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun watching!\\n\\n",

            "content": "I know this is the part of the review that everyone reads and skips over because I do it all the time but I cannot express my self enough to go watch this series! TRUST ME! IT'S AMAZING! SPOILERS AHEAD(?)\r\nStory 9/10: I don't normally watch mystery type anime and this is actually one of the first ones I've ever watch! It comes down to it that I doubt any mystery genre type with beat this one.. It brought all my emotions in every episode! There was a good mix of romance, mystery, drama and even a little bit of confusion sometimes.. I never got thewhole Grey Wolf thing so that kind of messed me up but it was amazing to watch! I cannot express it how it made me feel to watch this series! Even though it was made obvious who the killer was sometimes in the episode at most times it did have me scratching my head to how it all worked out! Mystery genre seems to be something that I need to check out in the future! But onto the story.. \\n\r\nSo the story is not your typical romance/drama filled series and explores a new type that I've seen where it'll go into some what of a detective type series that'll leave you gasping for more! I was really hoping for a season 2 but it seemed like it ended on a good note! I'm still kinda pissed about no kiss scene or no 3 special magic words moment which of defs made me cry!\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: The animation seemed really well laid out and it was never too dark or too colorful and seemed to have a mixed of both when it came down to it these moments! The anime never really showed me anything bad that seemed to bring the rate down but I don't think it was perfect..\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The sound/music was decent and nothing really popped out at me to think \"Wow what an amazing soundtrack\" but there was nothing really wrong with it either.. Nothing felt out of place and it all seemed to bit in perfectly! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: Okay.. Maybe it's just me and I know there's a word for it but I can't for the life of me remember what it is! BUT there's these characters in anime series that act like they're gods and I kind of felt that coming from Victorique.. It felt like every right the MC's got into was never resolved and they would just carry on like nothing ever happened! All someone tell me how the fuck she dyed her hair so quickly? Did they stop at a salon or some crap.. Oh well! Each character developed really well and the male protagonist was a real nice guy and is one of my favorite protagonists so far! The supporting characters were well mixed in and had alot to do with the main characters development aswell and it was good to see them get mixed in so well and actually have a reason for being there!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime is extremely well done and if you're looking for a good slow romance/drama/mystery genre show then you've come to the right place! CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!",

            "content": "When I get the charts for the next anime season, I try to have at least one of everything. Is there a mecha show? I'll check it out. A comedy looking thing? On the list. And I will try to have at least one show that can be considered \"serious business\". This is actualy the hardest one for me to fill, simply because of one simple thing: I am very picky. Hard to believe I know, I think the third season of Zero no Tsukaima was good, I can put up a decent defensive arguement for Girls Bravo and I consider Neon Genesis Evangelion tobe one of the greatest abominations to ever slap it's balls on the anime genre. As you can tell, I have bizare taste and, honestly, I first picked up GOSICK because there didn't seem to be anything better on that I could take seriously. Keep in mind, this was the season when I had the twin onslaught of Rio: Rainbow Gate and Dragon Crisis to deal with and I REALLY needed something with substance to ballance out the sheer amount of retardation presented to me by Rio, and the amount of eh given to me by Dragon Crisis. Now, allow me to say that I liked GOSICK alot, I mean ALOT. It was a refreshing breath of air in a medium that's currently being saturated in mediocrity or, worse, just plain badness. But enough of that rambling, let's get on with the content, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've never read the novel, so I can't tell you how well it holds up to it, but I can give you the gist based on what I've seen. We are thrown into the made up kingdom of Saubure in 1924. Kazuya Kujo, a transfer student from Japan (even in those days we had them huh?) and enlists in an academy within the country. As it turns out, people in those parts love mysteries, ghost stories especialy, and he just happens to stumble across one. One of the more famous academt stories proves true, as he discovers upon entering the academys library tower amd meets a mysterious girl called Victorique, a girl so hyper intelligent that she solves cases even the police and detectives can't solve for breakfast. The nice thing about this plot, is that it develops way past this simple tale into something much more complex and intertwineing and you'll often find yourself caught up in the momentum. It goes from simple murder mystery to political intrigue, snakeing into the power struggle within the country and the eventual outbreak of the Second World War. The only real issue is that some of the mysteries, the early ones especialy, are a little too easy and you'll find yourselves working out the answer sometimes even before the characters do.\\n\\n\r\nThe real enjoyment though, comes from the character interaction between Kujo and Victorique. Some people might find Kujo to be a little bit grateing at times, and with good reason. He sometimes falls victim to the narrative quirk alot of anime protagonists suffer from with being completely blind to another persons feelings, not through malice, but simply because he just doesn't pick up on it. He's been given the nickname by viewers \"Denseman\" for a reason you know. He can be very sweet an endearing when he tries however, and it's this that makes him more than tollerable to anyone willing to just go with it. Victorique is a totaly different story. Though being a little girl, she manages to keep up the haughty attitude even in extreme danger. At times though, it's clear that she's still young and vunerable, as when the series progresses the very thought of never seeing Kujo again makes her break into tears. Her intelligance can be debated heavily, howerver. Though they offer explanation for it in the show, it's not entirely clear where it comes from, how she got it or, indeed, when it can be used. It's as though she can't even make an educated guess untill she has all the necessary information. If I had to compare it, I'd say it's a little like Miss Marple, she quietly works it all out in her head and comes to the correct conclusion. She also has one of the best laughs ever, just saying, and can also be kind of cute when she wants to be. There are several other characters, and I could spend a long time talking about them, but it's not entirely clear how some of them develop. Thankfully, all of them are very strong and don't require too much of a change for them to fit nicely into the plot from begining to end.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is fitting, given the time period, with a nice amount of gothic archetecture thrown in. I'm sure there are alot of people who can pick out the small historical inaccuracies within it. The animation is also pretty fluid and pleasent to look at if that's your kind of thing. \\n\\n\r\nMusic wise, you'll barely notice any of the in-anime songs that play on occasion. While the opening never changes throughout the show, there are two ending themes. Both of them are by Lisa Komine and they reflect the dramatic change in story tone perfectly when it eventualy happens. The first is serious while keeping itself lighter hearted (and, of course, in the begining, all the interest is in finding out more about Victoriques mysterious past) and the second...well, you'll see for yourself. The opening, by yoshika*lisa, while not perfect does fit the show pretty well. And here's a neat little trick, mute the opening and play the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann opening song over it. Tell me it doesn't fit, I dare you. Aoi Yuuki (Mina Tepes, Dance in the Vampire Bund) does an incredible job as Victorique and deserves alot of credit for it. The rest of the cast do a decent enough job, while nothing particularly note worthy coming to mind.\\n\\n\r\nGOSICK recieved quite a bit of hype leading up towards its release. Quite alot of people didn't believe it could live up to the novel, as we all know anime based off of books or manga are rarely as good or better than their source material *cough*SoraNoOtoshimono*cough*, but equaly I haven't heard any major complaints by these people either, so I hope they were pleasently supprised. I have to give kudos to Bones for this one, they did a very good job with GOSICK and I find it hard to even think of one single complaint I could have for it apart from the slight frustrations one might have with Kujo. Now, I'm perfectly aware GOSICK has both novels and manga as it's source material, but there's one, small problem. They were both distributed by Tokyopop. TOKYOPOP. This means that I am almost totaly unable to read them unless I hunt them down on the net or sink into my bank account and order them off of Amazon which is also likely to be close to impossible very soon. When all aspects are considered, I'd find it hard to live with myself if I gave GOSICK anything less than a 10. A 9 at the very least but, ever the optomist, my final score has to be:\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10",

            "content": "This anime to me will always be the little anime that thought it could. Gosick is an interesting romance that likes to make you feel like it's going somewhere when in its actuality all it comes down to is hand holding and blushing. Before watching Gosick you should be warned that it is one of those anime in which you can only watch a few episodes at a time before somewhat losing interest and leaving to do something of equal or less importance. The fact of the matter is because the mystery genre has to take a back seat for the overarching plot. I wantedto really enjoy this anime because the character development was really interesting and was handled really well. Buuuuuut as soon as mystery is thrown out the window near the end and quite a few years pass it feels like a massive acid trip that I soon want to forget. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe overarching plot is rushed and wasn't really all that interesting to begin with. I like to think of it as a story about Kujou and Victorique's love growing for each other. But basically the part I enjoyed was when Kujou would find the evidence and Victorique would piece it together.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10\\n\\n\r\nBones never ceases to amaze me with their visuals... Just need to work on their endings. Anyway, I never really found myself disgusted by choppy visuals in this anime because there are none. The OP is amazing on it's own.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6\\n\\n\r\nNothing at all was memorable except the first ED. The OP, OST, and second ED are all pretty bad and barely amplified any sense of emotion in scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, part of the reason I could push on through this show is because every character seems to develop quite a lot. Even Grevil seems to start to care for his sister. We also have a moe blob teacher which I suppose is better than a moe blob loli. Also, I found it quite amusing that Victorique is a mature loli while Kujou is an immature highschooler that acts like little kid when he doesn't get his own way.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed almost the entire show... Except for the those rushed last episodes. It also had a shit overarching plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI would have given it a 7 but it's character development and art were both too good and are able to carry the show. The overarching plot is just handled terribly and dealt with too quickly. The sound was bad as well. We will be seeing a new manga series being made with Kujou and Vicorique solving crimes as detectives in Gosick Red (FUCK YES) I would like to see this show dubbed.",

            "content": "Art (8/10)\r\nGood and consistent art throughout the series. Background scenery along with extras had a decent amount of work put into them. Characters were well-drawn. Nothing extraordinary but certainly not horrible. \r\nCharacters (10/10)\r\nHere's where the series really shines. From the start of the show to it's end, it was obvious that the two main characters Kazuya Kuj\u014d and Victorique de Blois were developed extremely well. For Victorique, her view of Kuj\u014d changed dramatically, from \"I can do anything myself and I don't need your help\" to \"I am helpless without you\", because of the time they spent together - proving that, through time, even themost unlikely of friendships can happen. As for Kuj\u014d, he slowly grew closer and closer to Victorique throughout the episodes, with his desire to protect her growing alongside the time he spends with her. Although both have felt left out and lonely in their life, all their troubles are put aside when they are together. Just seeing their happy faces when they are with each other is enough to put a smile on anyone's faces. Through them, it is evident that a great friendship allows the hearts of those involved to be never separated; not by wars, other people's schemes or physical distance. In just a few years, the lonely Golden Fairy and Springtime Reaper create an unbreakable bond; a heartwarming outcome that is not seen as often. Masterfully developed characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nFirst of all, I would like to say that the OP and two EDs were spectacular. Even after the 24 episodes, I would not mind listening to them once more. During the endings of the last few episodes, I found that the ED fit in extremely well, with the lyrics \"Whenever, Wherever\" really adding the extra impact to the physical separation between many of the characters. The BGM, however, didn't impress me as much. Though it wasn't out of place, I personally didn't really care if the BGM was there or not in some scenes. The dialogue alone was enough to drive the story. As for voice acting, rising star, Yuuki Aoi, did an excellent job voicing Victorique. At only 19 years of age (18 when she started voicing Victorique), it's amazing how she already does voice acting at a professional level. Fantastic OP/EDs and excellent voice acting balanced with mediocre BGM earns this category an 8. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nWhen I first started watching GOSICK, it was all about the gruesome mysteries to me. The first half was actually disappointing. While the character development was there, the mysteries seemed quite lame, especially with Victorique being able to solve them so quickly. However, as the second half of this show started, the story began to pick up steam. Now I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say that it wasn't good mysteries that got this a 9, it's the problems surrounding the characters themselves. With lots of questions surrounding many of the side characters slowly being answered, the \"fragments of Chaos\", as Victorique says, started coming together. With the climax of the series at the Episode 23, the last episode wrapped everything up quite well. Overall, the story, aside from the crappy mysteries in the first half, proved to exceed my expectations. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nWith it being the first mystery genre anime I have watched, GOSICK really helped me open my eyes. I enjoyed watching it for the most part and look forward to anything similar in the future. I hope that those of you who are questioning whether to watch it because of the genre will give it a try. I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy it, no matter if you are craving for some mysteries or you are looking for a solid story. Definitely one of the best shows of the Winter 2010/Spring 2011 season. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "See, when I was just a little AnimeGirl I used to watch detective Connan on the TV. Now I found a more interesting, better and more mysterious anime that is kinda the prefect show for all the Anime beginners out there (I even recommended it to my teacher, who is now a great anime lover). Using my fountain of wisdom I will represent you the anime of this review, the Sherlock Holmes of the anime world...Gosick! \r\nPlot and Storyline:\r\nThis is the type of stories where you have a couple of shorter stories that are not connected with each other at first sight, but become awhole in the end when the makers show you the hidden details on witch you didn't pay attention in the beginning. Sounds hard to understand, but it is not at all. Gosick is an anime where the genres mystery, historical and romance merged together into an awesome story that truly finds a place in your heart. \\n\r\nNow let's set the scene first. We have the year 1924. World War I is over and a new life is beginning. In the middle of the story we have Kazuya Kujo, who is a transfer student from Japan. He enrolled the Saint Marguerite Academy in Sauville, a small European country between France and Italy. \\n\r\nThe people in Sauville and so the students at the Academy are all crazy about urban legends and horror stories which they believe are actually true. Kujo hears a story about a golden fairy that lives at the top of a library tower. What a coincidence. He meets Vistorique, a short girl with long, golden hair that lives at the top of the library tower of the academy. She is a detective prodigy that uses her \"Fountain of Wisdom to take fragments from the chaos of this world and reconstruct them into truth\". Easier said, she uses her cleverness and solves cases for her detective older brother. Together with Kujo she goes on several trips where she solves all kinds of mysteries and of curse enjoys the time she spends with him. \\n\r\nAs said in the beginning, the plot is made up of these 2-3 episode long  short stories that kinda find their way together in the end. So, if you want a good story, which Gosick definitely is, put a small, clever girl in the middle, add a nice boy to her, let the government in to interrupt their interest and...Boom! You have a catchy, cute, little story that will surely get your attention. \\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime surely are something. You have ma mash up of all kinds of personalities and relationships. I will just talk about the main two. Let me start with my personal favorite.\\n\r\nVictoruque de Blois is the Tsundere of this anime. She always acts so cold and bossy towards Kuji, but actually has some hidden feelings for him. She is so cute. The way she wants to cover up her weaknesses is just hilarious. But the thing that's really important about her is her cleverness and wisdom. She's just amazing. Also, she really is the carrier of the whole story. She is the turning pint of everything and everybody else is just an add. Great job as main, round of applause!\\n\r\n There is nothing much to talk about Kujo Kazuya. He was just lucky to be there and to introduce the story. The character it self is actually nothing special. Just an ordinary, nice boy who has to maintain the family honor as being the 3rd son of a Japanese General. All his actions are more the result of his love and care for Victorique than his personality.\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThis anime has an overall animation. It is not the best I've seen but it is not bad. There are two things I personally love about this anime. \\n\r\nFirstly I have to mention the landscapes of this anime. They are beautiful. So bright and colorful...Kawaii. \\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nThis is an anime for every soul. Trust me, if you start watching it you won't be able to stop until the end. The story is catchy, with no stupid plot holes and a great character development. The thing that made me say \"Awwwwww\" in the end is the love story between Kujo and Victorique. I usually don't like romance based movies and shows but in anime it's always so differently brought over to the audience. It was cute and so emotional in the end, that could make a lot of you cry in the end. \\n\r\nI always loved tsundere characters because they are so cute and funny and Victorique really is one.\\n\r\nI liked Gosick, I could watch it again sometime. Give it a try, you won't regret. \\n\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

The characters could have been more developed but hey it was only 24 episodes. I have enjoyed this anime like no others ithas its high points and low but the action never seems to cease especially with all the mysteries shrouded in the characters lifes. Overall this anime in my opinion was one of the best i have seen and i enjoyed the art and the style this anime brought if i could i would give it a 100",

            "content": "I actually enjoy watching detective series like conan and so on. So I thought I may give Gosick a try.\r\nAfter two episodes I thought \"Well... it's okay, but I don't like it that much\" and that's why I made a break. After month and finally a complete season I gave it another try and completed the anime in one 'rush'.\r\nI wrote this review nearly after I watched the last episode, so I want to give you my impression of the anime.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe story begins pretty easy, there is a mysterious girl in a library(-tower) and a common boy who is going to be interested inher. That's something you can already read in the summary. Well the story is somehow weird and good. I mean the cases they have in different episodes are very good explained and really enjoyfull, but after the 2nd half of the anime everything went somehow apart. The overall story changed a lot then and I got more and more the impression of watching 'Spirited Away'.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the artwork of Gosick a lot. I usually take a sharp look at this point, especially because I'm an artist myself. The animation was very soft and the characters were pretty detailed and full of ideas. Especially the background scenes were awesome, I like them a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe music and sound was really good. Especially the original japanese voice actors did a great job here. If someone is crying then it sounds like he/she  really does. And the orchestra music was just awesome, I enjoyed the movie like music in a lot scenes. I just thought they should take the ending song for the theme song, was a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nYou may wonder why I choosed six points if I just wrote that the characters have much detail and so on. Well actually only the main (female) character is memorizable (Well okay the blond haired policeman too). If I rethink about this anime in half a year I will probably forget them all except the mentioned main character. The others are just to bold and not that special. Even the main (male) character does nothing than being a slave and crying her name thousand of times. Nothing special if you ask me. But at least the anime has a lot characters you can hear the stories from, which makes it very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed a lot of the anime, but also disliked some stuff. I can't say to much here, because I would spoil a lot. The interesting thing is, I watched the anime because I was interested in the detective stuff, but even after this changed I stayed addicted, which means I enjoyed more than I disliked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIf I could seperate the anime I would give it for the first half 9/10 and the second half 5/10. The anime was a good one, but changed to fast in the middle. It went (maybe to fast) from the interesting mysterious girl-detective to historical affairs and so on, don't want to spoil here.\\n\r\nEven if many people prey for a 2nd season, I'll hope that it ends with this. The ending was a good one with some facts I dislike, but at least it is good. A 2nd season would ruin everything in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI just can say after writing this review that you should give it a try, it may be one of your favourites or it won't. Even if it won't, you will not waste your time and get a big story with some laughts here and there.\\n\\n\r\nCheers\\n\r\n(Sorry for my crappy english)",

Because well of everything starting from plot and going all up to Characters.\r\nStory: Story is Sherlock Holmes like but in Gosick its not an Guy solving mysteries but a Small kind of unsocial high school girl. Story takes place year 1924 in a small European country called Sauville ... There is a school which is bound by hundreds of mysteries , stories and etc... There comes our protagonist Kujou in start of his new school life he hopes to get a lot of friends but because of his appearance and many mysterious storieshe gets bound to having no friends at all because of this popular \"The dark reaperr\" story until he stumbles upon this huge library tower in search of those stories which bounds him so much ... And here is the encounter with this little golden hair Fairy... From here on starts many mysteries and crimes occur which Our golden Fairy Victorique who is always bored and  Kujou \"The dark reaper\" who always brings her something to do are bound to solve and with that they strengthen their bond ...\\n\\n\r\nArt: Awesome 1924 year old buildings , all the clothes everything is from old times makes u feel warm especially if u like all that old times atmosphere rather than robots and etc. You can also see some illustrations from books that looks awesome and everything.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Well nice music now and then good voicing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Hmm interesting especially Kujou because u won't see such character to often in todays animes hes like totally new and fresh ... without being dense or something like that. It's interesting to watch and guess what he will do in next episode. Other characters are pretty much the same.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoy these series very much they didn't fail to deliver anything and i can proudly say its my no.1 anime of this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Well its a beautiful mysteries filled anime series which gives some thrill at times but also makes you laugh. I recommend it.",

Now for the full on review Warning some spoilers ahead.\r\nStory 7.97: The story of Gosick can actually be considered to be divided into 2 segments. The first half of the series is designed like as series of episodic arcs that focus on adifferent mystery that both our protagonists try to solve. The Second half focuses on our main heroine herself, the reason surrounding her birth, The Conspiracy behind it and the culmination of a series of events that lead to both our protagonists\u2019 final faiths in the story. While I did not mind these two segments of how the plot within the story was, it can cause quite a friction and divided opinions as how u can take this format. Mostly is the fact due to the episodic nature of the first half and the ultimate final arc in the second half it can seem like you are actually watching 2 series at once and can leave u in a state of confusion and can seem rather pointless and asking yourself why bother with it and why not just go straight for the final story, I rather enjoyed it. It can be interpreted as a way of giving the characters some development time and strengthen there bonds. The second half was without a doubt the better part of the series, the sheer complexity and conclusion of it all made it all worthwhile especially by the time the ending comes and it makes u feel the story has come to full circle.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7.5: Hmm this one I see it as the underwhelming factor of the story, While our main heroine Victorique is given plenty amount of time to develop and understand her character other compared to her seemed rather underdeveloped and even pointless to a degree.\\n\\n\r\n For example our main hero Kujo is the main hero in this story and his development along with Victorique\u2019s is without a doubt one of the highlights of the show but if remove her from the equation Kujo does not really have much to show to us he is nearly always either with our heroine or always focusing on her but whenever we focus on just him it feels so pointless and speaking of pointless other character such as the Teacher Cecile and fellow student/love rival Avril also seemed to have little development and for the most part are pointless in the story. \\n\\n\r\nAvril really has nothing to offer in the story except to just be the love rival and comedic relief character and that is it not much development and ultimately unnecessary same can be said for Cecile the teacher she just your typical friendly teacher who wants what\u2019s best for her student but mostly is just there for comedic relief as well. \\n\\n\r\nThan u have the brother to our main heroine Grevil at first he was shown as the typically bumbling inspector to take the credit of out hero\u2019s work later down the road his characters gets more complicated but not enough time is given to fully explore this complexity to its full potential which is a shame as it could have been a very good progression to his development and then u have the main villain The marquis Victorique\u2019s father who is anything but that, just a power hungry egotistical lunatic who is just there to play the villain role and well he defiantly accomplishes that as u would beg to have his come-upping\u2019s by the end. In regards there are others as well but I think I spoiled to much of the plot already but bottom line, the series real weakens is not much the story rather the character development, which while good needed to have been better.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8 : The studio behind the animation is of course Studio Bones and of course this is one of the best animation studio\u2019s out there in the market, the animation in this very good. The way it reflects the Early 20th century style and background is a great accomplishment as it is reflected well, in terms of quality it is I would say rather consistent. It was beautifully made but it never had anything spectacular that makes it mark in terms of animation quality but at the same time it never had, at least from my perception a single animation frame out of place or lower budget, it is clear that Bones spread the budget for the animation quite evenly and it allowed it to remain consistent and in good quality throughout it\u2019s entire run so I would give proper to the animation director and the people behind him very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 8.12: The opening and closing themes songs are both quite good and very soothing to listen and understand, in almost every episode I would have allowed the intro to play again and again which each episode as it was good to hear and the ending of the first ending theme was also great as instead of skipping it u would want to just sit back relax and allow it to play, the second ending theme was well while I would have preferred they kept the first ending song this one was still actually quite good to hear especially in the latter parts of the story when it shifts to a more melancholy and gloomy atmosphere that fitted well with the theme song. AS for the standard ost used trough the episodes it was mostly a mixture of classical music and when I say classical I mean the instruments used and not specific songs that reflected the early 20th century atmosphere vibe very good and remained consistent trough the majority of the series, nothing truly fantastic but still very good throughout its run.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9: If u are interested in watching a good old fashioned story focusing on mysteries, adventures with an early antiquity setting and a very good romance story I would defiantly recommend you this show to watch. It is not to say a master piece but I can consider it a classic and at least a must try to watch recommendation especially if u are fan of the genre\u2019s I just listed or if u are looking for something to watch for a dull day.\\n",

            "content": "I don't usually write reviews, actually this is the first review I have ever written for an anime on this site. \r\nAlthough I was hesitant to doing this, the greatness and overall enjoyment I had from this anime made me do it.\r\n-Story-\r\nThe story and setting is as it is stated, earlier years after the events of WWI. The story revolves around an exchange student from Japan (Kujo) who travels to a country named \"Saubre\". He joins a 'special' academy (won't say more than that), where he settles in.\r\nAlthough he is pretty normal, since he is Japanese he quickly gets the nickname The Black Reaper, whichis a myth the academy has.\\n\\n\r\nOne day, he goes to the library. He goes all the way up to the botanical garden at the top (the library is shaped as a giant tower), at the top he meets a girl. She is small, has long blond hair and looks like a doll. Veronique.\\n\\n\r\nThe story then revolves around Kujo's and Veronique's adventures (eh) or should I rather say events.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a goodhearted story, but it is not all fun and games!\\n\r\nI must give this story a 10, I really enjoyed it. Even though it seemed as if it was a comedy at first, it seemed like a good comedy. Of course the setting changed through the episodes, and I quickly learnt that it wasn't all about the comedic aspects in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nI really, REALLY, love the art style of this anime. Everything is quite well drawn, and it adds to that vintage/older styled feel. The drawing of the hair, clothes and the characters in general go very well with the backgrounds and the settings they are in.\\n\\n\r\nI must give this a 9 out of 10 in Art, I really did love the art style.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nI had no problems with the sound whatsoever, I watched this with Eng Subs but from the sound of the music to the voices of the characters everything fit very well! I must say, it scores a 10 out of 10 in sound, no problems for me!\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nOh man, oh man! I love the characters, they aren't over-the-top stupid nor super-serious. They are perfect, that's all I got to say. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime quite a lot, it gave me as good enjoyment as Clannad did, of course this is not the same theme as Clannad, but this anime I must say to this date has me speechless. I am putting it on my no. 1 favourite anime until I find something that is even better! (Not sure if possible D:) 10/10\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\nYou should definitely watch this anime if you love some drama with some mystery, relationship building that is not over-the-top romance with a hint of action and excitement. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to all you fellow Lone Wolves out there, who loves an entertaining anime!\\n\\n\r\nThis scores a 20 points out of 10!",

            "content": "This review will be somewhat short even though the series was pretty long. Ill try to briefly talk about all the good & bad points about this anime and if its worth watching or not. Here we go!\r\nYes it is worth watching, especially to people who love watching detective and bones anime or TV shows. It would be 10/10 without that horrible ending, more about that later.\r\nFirst the things i liked in this anime\r\n1. Interesting - It has a lot of investigating, interesting cases and so on. 10/10\r\n2. Romance - Cute, just fucking brilliant, but it just doesnt give you a satisfying ending. NOW WAIT,for some series, where the romance isnt that strong, it doesnt need a good romance ending, but its definetly neccessary for this series because basiaclly from ep.1 the romance is really heavy 8/10. Ill talk more about that in a bit\\n\r\n3. Girl - a CAB as i like to call them meaning ''Cute as Balls'' 10/10.\\n\r\n4. Time period - Unlike most anime, this one sets place in 1924, which makes this series unique, interesting and overall enjoyable 9/10\\n\r\n5. Action - Used well to boost the romance all troughout the series 10/10\\n\r\n6. Cool Characters - Got similar vibes to Tokyo Ghoul from some of the characters and overall this ''joker'' theme games and stuff that i think goes BRILLIANTLY with bones anime 11/10, my approval.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for some stuff that I DIDNT LIKE about this anime, especially the ending ( Contains MAJOR spoilers, if you havent seen it yet GET OUT SHOO SHOO )\\n\\n\r\n1. ENDING - OH GOD.. like literally hints of romance since the fucking first episode, so youd expect the ending to REALLY be something, since its really focusing on that. So i watched the entire series REALLY HOPING FOR SOME ROMANCE IN THE END. Did i get it?? No i certainly did not.. all i got was them holding hands in the end. LITERALLY THE MOST UN-SATISFYING ENDING for a show thats THAT HEAVY ON ROMANCE LITERALLY FROM THE FIRST FUCKING EPISODE!!!!\\n\r\nwhatever would have been 10/10, if they hadnt fucked up the ending.\\n\r\n2. Other girls - IM NOT GAY, BUTT i did not like all those bitches around the main character. cmon u have ur cute girl. I guess this is just something thats apart of anime overall so i dunnoo.\\n\\n\r\nIts really not a bad series, but that ending is pretty fakking horrific. Dont know if it has a manga, but probably, soo to get rid of the buttpains from the last episode, you might need to read the manga or like make up your own ending or something.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you wanna see similar anime shows to Gosick, id recommend Hyouka, Its even better and for TV shows Castle is definetly the best one in that genre. Just trust me theyre both REALLY good.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I wasnt expecting much when watching this anime i just found it randomly and thought this look interesting. And here is what i got. Gosik takes detective stories to another place if one might say its one of those anime that makes the a new version of the genre. \r\nStorywise the anime is set in another earth if you might but you do get the feeling that they use alot of older western names in them. Helvetia are one of the to give an example. Its engaging and fun yet gives you the mysterious and sad feel for the main characters in it. I liketo say that this anime gives me what i desire when i look for a new type of detecitve anime. Some of it might be things you have seen similarities with but in the end its all something that is true only to that world and even harder to copy. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound gives of the old gothic world if one might call it that and the opening gives that too. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character might feel pathetic at times but the combination with his female other he becomes interesting to listen to. Though much of that i will give to the female that if you watch this anime you will be more familiar with. Some of the bad characters in the anime are more of the typical anime like ones but others have a more sick mind one might say which gives you that feeling that you want to dislike them or even hate them. \\n\\n\r\nI might not be objective but its how i feel it when i give it its 9/10. The truth is that this anime is one of those rare pieces of detective work that other anime have problem finding. Instead of grabbing simple mysteries they create their own and this make this anime worth watching for all there is.",

            "content": "What is it that makes Gosick good? The construction of the plot and cases is as rickety as it is ambitious, with contrivance and a few real howlers (WWII in 1924?). Supporting and even main characters are more vivid than deep or original. Denouements often more sensationalist than well-founded or meaningful; the art and music are lovely, especially the OP and EDs, but wouldn't create a good series on their own.\r\nThe linchpin of appeal is, of course, Victorique De Blois. The eccentric and temperamental detective is a staple for a reason; Victorique plays the role to perfection, and makes it her own. Her inimitable dialogueand excellent voice acting, the contrast of her mental refinement and brazen rudeness, the endearing appeal of her fragile form and situation...I could go on, but you get the idea. Her assistant Kujo is certainly the weaker character, but shares a brilliant chemistry with his Charming Monster. Whether arguing with Victorique, or trying desperately to protect her from far stronger forces, he is a great supporter, and I defy anyone with a heart not to support their relationship by series end. Kujo's slowness has been touted as an unlikable quality. But a young man with nothing but earnestness going for him can be almost equal in sympathetic appeal to a captive golden fairy.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Gosick, despite aforementioned serious weaknesses, is sweeping enough to give Victorique the room she needs. Her world may not always be believable, but it constantly brims with magical possibility, and enough consistent, developing threat to arrest the readers attention. Enough that one wishes the mysteries were better, but does not stop watching. To make an informative comparison, the Dantalian no Shoka anime has a similar big-mouthed Loli detective leading the charge. Her male assistant is self-sufficient and capable, but absolutely lacking in Kujo's emotion, insecurities and evolving motivation. And the episodes are self-contained, without intelligible overarching plot. Hence, Dantalion no Shoka is a bad anime, and Gosick is a good, incredibly likeable one. Fans of old-fashioned romantic adventure, mysterious atmosphere and eccentric detectives should definitely love this show.\\n\\n\r\nNote 1: I understand that the order of some cases in Gosick was altered between the original light novels and anime. While I'm glad that the Queen Berry case grabbed my attention from the outset, the evolution of Kujo's fighting strength is messed up. He does worse in some fights that come later in the anime, because he was less experienced at the point they came in the novels! Not a big issue, just annoying.  \\n\\n\r\nNote 2: Victorique's detective style may be criticised by fans of the logical crime problems typified by Holmes and Poirot. Rather than assembling clues to exactly deduce what must have occurred, so that a sufficiently clever reader could solve the crime in advance, Victorique uses induction to propose a likely solution, based on her knowledge of human behaviour and superhuman instinct. Similar methods were used by Miss Marple and Father Brown, and often criticised in Miss Marple's case as unrealistic; at least Victorique makes use of superhuman powers. In defence of induction; to evoke the detective's life experience, as well as the tell-tale psychology of the villain, can create far more atmosphere than a mere puzzle. At its worst, the Holmsian murder puzzle is an artificial children's game, knocked out by Detective Conan week after improbable week. Shows like Gosick do not come along so often as that.",

            "content": "Wow, it was a beautiful ride after all.\r\nFirst, let me get this out. I initially dropped this after maybe 3-4 episodes. The mysteries were very predictable and the mc (I mean the male lead) was too dumb for me to handle. Even the side characters are too dumb, like Victorique's brother, for example.\r\nThat being said, it is probably the only problem I had with this series. The overall story was pretty solid. I liked how they handled the romance too.\r\nI loved the series for its drama and some cute romance moments. Even though it says 'mystery', i didn't quite enjoy the 'smart' part of itat all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the series would be the last few episodes (like 5-6 episodes). Those were the ones which actually had good overall story progression and drama. Loved those episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor rating, I usually don't care how it began or how the art style or music was in an anime while rating it. I rate it based on how I felt when it ended (i.e. \"enjoyment\"). And, boy, it was good. The end was so satisfying. It would be best if I don't talk about the end, otherwise, you wouldn't enjoy it as much. So, finally, I would give this a 9(more like 8.5 but whatever) out of 10.",

            "content": "\"It smells like sweets, even though it looks like dog feces!\" -Victorique\r\n          [[:  * Basically what my review is going to be like* :]]\r\n After the first five episodes of Gosick i was actually ready to go sick, but i decided to persevere and continue. It was around the 13th episode, it became intriguing. \r\n*Story* -  Picture it a fake European country in 1924 where our main character a Japanese transfer student named Kujo arrives at an elite academy. Due to his appearance of black hair and eyes , kids refer to him asthe \"Black Reaper\" (O_O?).  One day Kujo wonders into a library that seemed to have a million stairs he meets an off-putting girl named Victorique, a short girl with long blond hair, who spends most of her time reading and solving mysteries for her detective brother (Grevil). So the story follows around Kujo and Victorique how they solve mysteries. The first half of the show was a bit slow paced but, the mysteries were mysterious, the romance between Kujo and Victorique was there but it was delicate enough for you wanting more. \\n\\n\r\n*Art*- One word: Amazing. Well i guess it was three words. The art adds to the show.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound* - Everyone knows that a good soundtrack helps push things along and intensifies the scenes but I didn't notice the soundtrack AT ALL?! Gosick's soundtrack is one of those tracks that make's you feel like paint is the most amazing thing ever. I guess the voice acting WAS the soundtrack >.>\\n\\n\r\n*Character* - I  enjoyed the characters but, Victorique was really good, with a tragic back story and goal to achieve. One of my favorite characters was Grevil. Mostly because of the hair. All in all  good characters.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* - Its a great series to watch if you were passing time or you just want to enjoy a mystery.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nI forgot to mention this in my review but Kujo is a boy everyone thinks is a punk, a short tsundere whose father is an retard and there misadventures with love together. It's kinda like a England version of Toradora.\\n\\n\r\n                       \"Th4t's th3 th30ry 4nyw4ys.\"",

            "content": "Wow... I finished the anime.... It's Really amazing! At the beginning, it was a detective story, then it went on becoming a story of love, a story of war and finally a story of life.\r\nIt is undoubtedly a unique anime. The story is set in between 1924 and 1929, between two world wars in a small European country named Sauville. A boy from the farthest east (Japan) comes to this mysterious country and becomes friend with a girl who lived her life alone in confinement and was treated as a mere tool to be used in proper time. She led a life never experiencing love.But after meeting the boy, she finally found happiness. But the war comes and separates themselves far far away. Will they be able to meet again? Yes!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nA very unique story filled with mystery from first to last. The first half is all about solving cases. These cases are very interesting. The clues are there. Even you can try and figure out the answer! The second half is about romance, friendship and war. So, you are getting many different flavors. Although the story has many murders and deaths... It's dark, but realistic. It's not a dream world, but finally at the very end, the dream comes true!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nVery pleasant, soothes your eyes. But at times dark also, needed for the story. The art is dreamy. I don't know how to put it in words, but I really liked it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were nice. Background music did great job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThere are many characters involved who played very important roles. They all got sufficient development. The characters are very different from each other. I liked the variety.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nFrom start to the end, I was brimmed with enjoyment. Gosick is definitely one of my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nGosick is a Mystery, Detective, Romance, War genre anime. It did really well in these. I want to watch more anime like this. After so many disappointments, studio Bones finally became able to put out a great show.",

Firstly, although it is but a minor element in the show, Gosick has incorporated issues such as political conflicts, slave trade, and world wars into its plot, not overly emphatic as to make them seem pedantic, but relevant enough as to leave a tinge of distaste in one's conscience.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, what I find most impressive of this series is the development of Victorique as a character. Her first appearance in a series presents herself as a highly intelligent but cantankerous girl, eerily apathetic, closed off - an intriguing figure but not nearly a likable one. As the story progresses, however,Victorique's gradual humanization is subtly depicted in a manner that is neither forced nor unnatural. The result of this masterful facilitation of her mental growth is that by the finale, Victorique appears to be a completely different and matured character and yet maintained all the traits which made her unique in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThough not without its flaws, Gosick is a beautiful series that I believe has masterfully achieved what it sought to convey.",

Every time I would hear it as our MC went about the world, I'd become incredibly intrigued and curious on whats around the corner.\r\nIt is this made togetherness that made the watch really interesting all the way through.\r\nI was at first abrasive at seeing our main female lead, but like thesettings and the world, it grows so much that you want to know the whats and the whys.\\n\\n\r\nIt also could've fooled me to say it was a type of investigative mystery show but I believe that was just me wanting to investigate the world itself and the stuff going on. Instead it would be a more so dramatic show, with a bit of romance to give some motivation for the end bit.\\n\\n\r\nI still can't get over the music, I have an anime playlist in my device, and whenever songs from this come up, I always love to give it a listen.\\n\\n\r\nAlways thinking back to this anime, it reminds me how important it is to understand and bring focus to storytelling because it can make the audience want to go there themselves.",

It could've been a masterpiece but it just had to go to waste. An episodic anime which didn't have that intricate, detective storyline I was looking for, or even the romance. First of all, the characters. There are 2 MCs which I dislike from the start.\r\n#Characters (3/10)\r\nVictorique-- An intelligent and wisdomful child who solves problems in a blink of an eye and seems bored by it. Don't get me wrong, I love characterslike her, calm & collected. But her personality ruined the chances of me liking her all over. Arrogant, pampered and bratty. That's the least you would want in a character.\\n\\n\r\nKujou-- Just a baka who happens to find Victorique and since then started doing mystery solving together. He didn't even do anything!! Just asking \"what? How come? When?\" and in the end VIctorique is always the one who solves it. \\n\\n\r\n#Plot\\n\r\nOh, boy. Where do I start. It's just bland from eps 1-10. Sure, they've been solving mysteries for the entire time, but how do you solve it? Victorique just basically said, \"With my wisdom, bla x3\", showing a green shining moment and BOOM! It's solved. They just didn't tell us how they found it out. And being an episodic anime didn't help.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, I tried.. Tried to enjoy this anime and finish it til' the end but it's just not worth my time and not my cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, if you're watching to kill time and don't mind the random episodes you should watch it. If you're looking for an exciting detective anime don't even bother. But nonetheless, I still have to thank the author and producer for the effort in making this anime.",

            "content": "Gosick was an anime that had been begging for my attention almost ever since I joined MAL a month and a half ago. But like a stubborn child I kept finding reasons to ignore it. They started off extremely lame: \"That cover photo looks stupid. It's just a little girl in a bad mood. And it looks all dark. Why would I want to watch that?\" They eventually got better as I started running out of excuses: \"It's a historical anime. I bet I would find it boring.\" \"It's a drama. It's well documented that I can't handle dramas.\" Among others... but I finally gavein to this pleading little anime, partially because along the way I had picked up rumors about this being one of the better animes on MAL. So I had to eventually check it out. It turned out to indeed be quite a solid anime. There's just one issue with this anime that keeps it from being considered, at least in my opinion, a true legend. As my review unfolds, I'm sure you will eventually figure out what it is.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10\\n\r\nYou could tell as soon as the first episode was over that there would not really be any long lasting story in this entire series. Instead, they chose to operate with mini-plots, you could say. Every time a (major) mystery began, it would lead into a new plot, impacting Victorique and Kazuya differently each time. Always putting them in peril, but in different ways. And they would have different goals, different obstacles, so on and so forth. The mysteries were the stories. Not the series as a whole. So there was really no need for a major plot-line that ran throughout. There was a \"B story\" that ran most of the series that was the only story-line that transcended across multiple mysteries. It was the fascinating story-line that followed Victorique's mother, Cordelia. There are so many layers to that one story alone it is remarkable. It is both tragic and beautiful. For those who feel it is just a bunch of mysteries, the story of Cordelia will prove you wrong. Sadly, though, outside of the story of Cordelia, it IS pretty much just a bunch of mysteries. They do a great job of making a few of them look difficult, trying to make them as unique as possible, and then when Victorique solves it they have her walk it through step-by-step to prove how it could have been done and how this wasn't just some dark version of a Scooby-Doo trick. Where I draw the line is with the mysteries themselves. Gosick went for uniqueness and I feel like they overshot it and ended up with unrealistic. Fortune tellers deciding who wins World War 1 based on what kids survive murdering each other on a boat? An African alchemist who's after a substance created in Harry Potter? A beheading means an Average Jane gets to pretend to be Queen? Yeah, I don't buy those as mysteries that would happen in the \"real world\". And I felt like this series was trying to sell us on two high-school aged kids trying to solve mysteries that could also happen in the \"real world\". Well, they failed there. They did an EXCELLENT job of spelling it out and making the crime sound like a realistic crime, but in reality, it never was. And I consider that a turn-off. The story was decent, but it clearly needed some work too.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art in Gosick looked magnificent. They're number one challenge was not just to simply look good, but to also look realistic according to the time in which this anime took place. This is not your regular anime that takes place in the present day. This anime takes place WAY back in 1924!!! So I'm sure they did some quick research to make sure they were up-to-date on what people wore back in the 1920's, as well as common modes of transportation, how buildings were decorated, what currency might look like, etc. They had to focus on EVERY LITTLE DETAIL if they wanted us to truly believe that Kazuya and Victorique were in 1924 Western Europe. And sure enough, Gosick focused on every little detail. Victorique only wore long flowing dresses to the point where you could only see her feet, Kazuya was always dressed properly as well everywhere he went, the main modes of transportation seen in the series are horse and carriage, trolley, and train, and there is no evidence of paper currency (among other things I could point out that scream \"1920's\") that in itself should just be enough to give the art department its due credit. But the work they did on the credits sequences was just as good, if not better! I've seen just as impressive credits sequences in other animes for other reasons, the three credits sequences that I saw for Gosick might have been the three most BEAUTIFUL credits sequences I have ever seen in any anime. HOWEVER, with all of that considered, I do think that Gosick's art department did make one minor mistake. Kazuya is Japanese. Pretty much every other character in the series is from the fictional country of Sauville, where the anime takes place, or from somewhere else in Western Europe. However, other than his obviously much darker hair, I can't tell much of a difference between Kazuya and, for this conversation, his male classmates. And to be more specific, I can't tell any difference in the DESIGN of Kazuya and the others. Now I know what you're thinking: \"Why change design for one character?\" Here's why: Kazuya is the only character from the Far East in this anime. Everyone else is supposed to be from Western Europe. People from those two locations are supposed to look distinctly different. So they should have made some obvious change to Kazuya's physical appearance (slanted eyes, change the shape of his head, change his skin tone, give him a different nose, give him freckles... SOMETHING) to make it abundantly clear that Kazuya was not from Western Europe. I feel they did not put enough effort into that.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is where Gosick came up with their best work. First, Like the art department had to do, the sound effects department had to mimic sounds from the 1920's. Not an easy task, but they did it flawlessly. Thanks to the work these two did hand-in-hand, you would swear this was a REAL period piece (at least for a moment). As awestruck as I was by how well they were able to match up the 1920's sound effects, however, what TRULY moved me was the music. When I began watching Gosick, I expected it to have rather harsh music that I probably would not enjoy. Instead, both its Intro number and Closing Credits #1 sounded more like moving, emotion-filled melodies that touched every layer of your soul. Not to mention how fantastic the music was. Closing Credits #2 sounded a bit closer to an opera ballad and was the closest Sound ever came to making a mistake. I still say it was great. Whenever a truly important or emotional moment came up in Gosick, they would play Closing Credits #1. It would make that moment all that much more wonderful. I can truly say this series has the most ironically beautiful music I've ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\r\nWhen you first start watching Gosick, some people can get confused at first because it may very well seem like there will be only two noteworthy characters in this entire 24 episode series. Those are, of course, Victorique and Kazuya. But as you continue to watch Gosick, you will realize that there are plenty of other character other than just those two that play a role in this series. All things considered, it may still be a pretty slim cast, but there are a lot more characters than I initially expected. First off there's Cordelia, Victorique's mother. She's never more than a side character, and she's only in like half the episodes, but when she appears, she's fascinating. She is one of the few characters in this series that can advance the story based on their actions. I would say only Victorique, Kazuya, and Cordelia have that kind of power. Victorique's older brother Grevil I think was also an interesting character. He seemed eccentric, egotistical, someone who loved being the center of attention, and a bit of a flirt. Despite all of that, however, Grevil did have a \"big brother\" side to him, which I liked. It was nice to see a nice, protective, caring side to Grevil to counteract the side he typically shows the public. He does do something late in the series that does cause me to lose a lot of respect for him, however. To avoid spoilers, I won't mention what happens. Avril Bradley I thought was probably the most interesting student at the academy outside of Victorique and Kazuya. Avril herself was initially a victim of identity theft. But she got it back, and became Kazuya's go-to pal for when Kazuya wasn't hanging out with Victorique. I always found it uplifting how, even when things were going rough for Avril, she always remained bright and positive and happy.While I do like all these characters, I should mention that my favorite character from this series is, of course, Victorique. She was just a fantastic little angel (if you could call her that). There's only one other anime character that I felt so connected with while watching the anime. Victorique's subtle sarcasm just spoke to me because it sounded just like how I would talk. Victorique is my favorite character I have ever watched and I think a lot of that is because I feel like I see a lot of me in her. Her quick wit, her love of sweets, her annoyance with stupidity, her dry sense of humor, all remind me of me. Characters probably would've done a little better if they were a little deeper to be honest. They had only two main characters and up to six supporting characters that helped play a role in the story in one way or another. That's just not quite enough characters impacting the story. The characters that WERE involved were good characters; there just weren't enough of them.\\n\\n\r\nENTERTAINMENT: 9/10\\n\r\nThe last time I tried watching a drama anime, I almost fell asleep at times. With Gosick, that was never a worry. I was keyed in very quickly. All the different mysteries had me hooked. Ironically, I was never really concerned with \"Whodunit?\" as I was with \"How did they pull it off?\" The \"How?\" always fascinated me. I think they organized this series very well, never making it too much of a chore to keep up with the story. I hope I meet characters like Victorique and Cordelia in my future animes because I literally cannot get enough of either character!!! Victorique in particular made this anime. This anime wouldn't be anywhere near as good without Victorique. I enjoyed just about everything this anime had to offer. However, I simply just didn't love every episode. Almost every episode was solid, but some were \"decent\", \"ok\", \"pretty good\"... things along those lines. And I just didn't feel \"perfectly entertained\" at those moments. Therefore, I couldn't give Gosick a 10 rating in Entertainment. It was VERY good. Just not perfect.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nI mentioned in the opening that I thought Gosick had one issue that kept it from being a true legend. If you have not figured it out by now, allow me to tell you what it is: Gosick's \"issue\" or \"weakness\" or whatever it should be called is the fact that Gosick did its best work where it matters the least and did its worst work where it matters the most. The one thing EVERY drama anime needs? A good story. Gosick's worst category? Story. The first thing an anime could live without? Sound. Gosick's best category? Sound. In reality Gosick is still solid in every category, it's just that where there are narrow advantages to be found, Gosick's more meaningless categories took them and the meaningful categories fell behind. Overall, definitely worth a watch. But before watching they would have to understand to expect a unique story layout and few characters but very well developed characters. Outside of Kazuya the Art is brilliant and matches the 1920's perfectly. You can barely find a mistake at all by anyone who worked on any of the sound. It was that flawless. The mysteries could've been more realistic. That would've been nice. With all these things in mind, Gosick still manages to be one of the better animes available to watch. The amazing thing is, if Gosick worked on a couple key pieces of the anime, it could actually be a lot better.\\n",

            "content": "I've asked people how they felt about this show before watching it and each of them gave me a different answer .A few people said its really good throughout , a few said its a show with a weak final half , a few said the final half saved the show and a few also said its a waste of time . After watching the show I'm not really sure how to see this . I found the first 3 episodes to be engaging . It wasn't spectecular but it did enough to have me watching . The show went through ups and downs afterthat . It was pretty inconsistent but imo never clicked that \"ergh this is not watchable\" mark .\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : The show is initially built around the childish banters between our 2 main characters Kujou and Victorique which develops into romance . Victorique is a genius teen with strong insight and photographic memory with a character of the tsundere archetype . She is deprived of love and is held as prisoner by her psychotic father throughout her life . Her friendship with Kujou plays a solid role in developing her character and she is the pillar of the show without any doubt . Kujou on the other hand is a generic anime hero with no character development whatsoever . He simply wants to put down his life on the line for the girl he just met . Most of the characters in this show aren't good by any means . We barely get to know about any of the characters , how they progressed when they did and some of the changes presented for the ones that had little development sometimes didn't make sense . But despite all that the relationship between Kujou and Victorique creates a warm feeling for the viewer to enjoy and even if you don't like the characters individually you find yourself wanting them to help each other grow . Although I mentioned Kujou isn't a likable character , due to his relationship with Victorique I personally found a strong desire for Kujou's character to grow and waited till the end for it to happen although it doesn't happen . Overall you could say the characterization is one of the weakest points of this show .\\n\\n\r\nPlot : The plot has a strong premise with an inconsistent execution . The ghost stories in the kingdom of sauville takes center stage as the main mystery focus of this show . Kujou gathers details for Victorique to solve cases . The show is very different from most mystery detective shows you will find as it doesn't give away too many clues before revealing what actually happened . Although some of written stories are very impressive when it comes to how Victorique solves them , some of them are really unrealistc and leaves much to be desired .  The plot takes a shift in the latter stages of the show and takes a rather dark approach with a strong political and tragic setting . In my opinion the final third of the show is its strongest part as well as being the most emotional one with the final 2 episodes being the standout . The plot progression more or less has you desiring for improvement  and yet has you watching the show and developing feelings which itself is a credit because most shows fail to do that no matter how good the structure of the plot is . The show doesn't offer anything life changing but is enjoyable as a whole nonetheless with a variety of elements with the early parts being mystery-romance(kind off )-comedy(it kind of tried ) and the final parts of the show being more dramatic and having more historical emphasis while strengthening the romance present in the show . Each part of the show will be appealing to different kind of audiences which explains the variety of reviews you may get for this show each saying different things about what they liked and did not like about the show . One thing I will strongly recommend is to not compare this with Sherlock as you may not enjoy the show if you find the resemblance (which is sort of there ) and try to compare the two . The mystery is quite good in some cases despite being pretty bad in some of the other ones . \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound : What everyone will agree on is the artwork and music was very good in this show and people who depend on those things to a enjoy a work will defiinitely enjoy this . The dress up strongly reflects europeans of early 1900's as the this is the time period used in the premise. The character designs are also solid and don't leave anything for complaining . The opening and ending are also very likable for the people who care .\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : I personally really liked this show .The flaws in Gosick are quite clearly visible and yet I didn't find it hard to enjoy the show . You always hope the show gets better and even when it doesn't you don't find yourself hating the show . The show overall is very good for what it is and perhaps it would've been better of being shorter . I would strongly recommend this to all sorts of audiences below the age of 25 as you will find atleast something to enjoy according to your taste . I wouldn't recommend this to people who are older as strongly though because one demands the presentation of \\n\r\nthings the difficult life often makes them forget in tv shows after that age . But you can always enjoy this if you want something heart warming with a good amount of dark plot without making too much fuss about the content not being too cohesive . \\n",

The writer of this story really know a thing or two about making/writing mysteries because I enjoyed gosick a lot and most of the times when I just thought I had the story completed it came to me and simply said: \"You're wrong!\" and then it makes you think: \"Why didn't Isee that, it's so obvious.\" Of course there were also some minor flaws and easy to see through elements in the story were you instantly think you know what happened but then they manage to change the story in such a manor that it still make you wrong, in a fun way.\\n\\n\r\nThe art:\\n\r\nI've given the art of this show a 9, simply because the art is nice and certainly not rushed and so far I haven't seen any weird drawn things.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound:\\n\r\nI've given the sound a 9 just because the sounds fit well and are really thought of.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nThe characters were carefully thought of and are very well made, I didn't experience any bad traits to a character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMy enjoyment in this anime was enormous, I never watched a mystery anime before and didn't expect much of it but it turned out to be a great anime and a great story where everything simply fits with beautiful scenes and great mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I've given this anime a 10 because it's a great anime and also one of the best I've seen so far, if you haven't seen this anime I reccomend you do it quick.\\n",

            "content": "Since this is my first review, i'll try and make it as simple as possible.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nGosick was highly recommended as a to-watch anime after i watched Kamisama no Memochou. Inside my head, i was like, \"This must be some kind of a detective/mystery anime\". I was expecting a full blast mystery, but what i didn't expect was the way they made the mystery revolves around a romance story. And i must say, it was a damn good love story. \r\nThere were a few mysterious death and mystery cases and after each one was solved, a hint of the real and final mystery was revealed. basically,this anime really will make you feel curious about this and that which will be resolved in the end. And you know what, IT MAKES SENSE! \\n\r\nThere were no major plotholes. everything was explained without any rush. the pacing of the story was so good, you won't even feel you already watched a 20 minute show. The ending of the story was perfectly executed. Seriously, towards the end, it was getting darker and darker and at one point, you will have this fear of how the heck are they going to end this marvelous love story.\\n\r\nbut fear not! It was beautiful\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art style was very good and it wasn't stiff at all. Everything flowed smoothly. the expression of the characters while conversing or when they were doing something was portrayed very well. It'll make the viewers to understand the mood surrounding the characters very well. I must say, the details, especially in Victoriques dress was very well made.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack really does creates the mood of the current event. And the first ending song was so good, it creates this excitement of wanting to know about what will happen in the next episode. The oping song was not that catchy, but didn't create a mystery atmosphere as well, since it was actually not mainly about mystery. It's the story of two characters in love.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nSo, the main characters are Victorique, a small petite girl that has the appearance of a Golden Fairy and a very sharp mind, and Kazuya, a student from Japan who studies in Saubure, a boy who has troubles adapting to new environment and has no friends. So they met. and secrets were unveiled.\\n\r\nFrom the first few episode, I concluded that Kazuya is not any typical anime guy character since he was not that stupid. Kazuya was actually pretty interesting. He knows what he wants and he is reliable. Victorique who is smarter tends to bully him... \\n\r\nBoth are a teaser. they teased each other. From episode to episode, you can see the development of the characters, from \"I will protect you\" to \"I want to be with you\". \\n\r\nKazuya and Victorique relationship really is from stranger to friends to bestfriends and finally to lovers. and heck, they didn't even tell they love each other. Love can't be express by words, that is what the characters were saying.\\n\r\nBesides both of them, there're few others characters and each one is a strong character. each one is interesting in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment; 9/10\\n\r\nThe enjoyment, frankly speaking is not just about how they solved the mystery or what the mystery is bout. but the enjoyment comes from seeing how the love story develops. It's hard to write a mystery story. It's harder to write a mystery story which revolves around a love story. This anime uses each mystery as a stepping stone for the character development. seeing that happen smoothly and without any abrupt pacing, it was really truly fullfilling. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI watched lots of romance based anime and Gosick was one of the top in my list of best romance anime i watched. Just watching them developed into a couple was enough to express the love they have towards each other. no need of the word 'Love' anywhere because it's not the thing you say, it's the thing you feel. This anime showed that to me. \\n\r\nThe mysteries inside this anime was top-notched. People might say that Victorique suddenly knew everything, and they would hate her for being so unrealistic but, I will tell you to watch it again, because all the clues were there from the start, you just need to think to understand why and how Victorique got her answer. \\n\r\nUsually in a romance story, it's either the girl is too stupid, or the guy is too stupid to know they love each other, but Gosick is not a usual love story. Both character develops feeling towards each other and they didn't even try to deny that fact. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love mystery, watch Gosick\\n\r\nIf you love romance, watch Gosick\\n\r\nIf you love both, Gosick is the best anime for you",

            "content": "At first, the story starts out slow with the repetitive scenario of problem - solution. The cases are not all that impressive as they are easy to solve, but are still enjoyable to watch, because the animation is so fluid and the characters are well rounded and continue to develop as the series progresses.  If the series continued on like this, I could see giving it a 7 or 8, but it didn't.  \r\n I could ramble on and on about the characters and what makes them amazing, but I'll make it short and sweet. The characters and their outfits are drawn wonderfullywhich is always a plus. The fact that the directors of the story give background to the characters gives them depth and makes them more realistic.  The Voice Actors are amazing...period. \\n\\n\r\nAround halfway through the show, I noticed that the show began to form a strong plot which is carefully weaved into the cases the protagonists solve.  In the following cases, the story begins to take a more serious and darker tone and the cases much more complex.  I also noticed that at several times the cases become fundamental to the progression of the story as well as give background details to the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nAround the last 8 or 9 episodes, there are no more cases and here is where the action, drama, and \"sitting on the edge of your seat\" moments are.  The interesting thing is that in order for you, the viewer, to completely understand what is going on, you must watch from the begining if you would like to get the most out of the show, but you do not have to really pay attention to what is going on until about the 5th or 6th episode.\\n\\n",

There are characters you hate through the story and then some you like at first then don't. I found it to pretty addictive.

But it would be better if a mystery show was able to create a sense of mystery. It seems like the producers of this show arent trying as hard as they could, even though it looks pretty. I know Grevil  is supposed to be annoying but it doesnt make it any easier. The characters I hope will get better as the series develops, I'll stick with it for now. As it was it did a decent job of setting up the characters and scenario, hopefully it willget more interesting as it goes along.",

            "content": "I did not hear about this anime from anyone. I found it by chance. But, this goddamn show, my god, was so touching and cleverly made, which means I both emphathized on characters and thought of story at the same time.\r\n== SOFT SPOILER ==\r\nEverytime I say, and will say, I love series with a theoretical ground. I can tell this fictional places mentioned in show and the people belonging to there have a common genetical property, \"intelligence\". This way, it is really based on evolutionary theory, especially the part that Gray Wolf is impregnated by force. The intention was to create a new child withhigh intelligence. And the Saulline Kingdom -where Gray Wolves are born- has successfully come to this day, survived due to their genetic property.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also projects the conflict between science and religion.\\n\r\n== SOFT SPOILER ==\\n\\n\r\nTake the story. It is goddamn great. At the beginning of series (like about 1-10 episodes), it seems to have a Chehov-based short mystery stories, yet after that, you see it was actually part of whole story itself. Then you be like: \"What the hell is happening?\". However, I must tell, story is kind of heavy.\\n\\n\r\nArt is great. The scenes of past events, teh art of old stories really project the feeling to you. You will not only watch, but you sense.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is great. That second ending -\"Unity\" by Lisa Komine- did really touch my heart. Whenever, wherever I hear that song, I sense the same feelings of anime. Theme sounds are also great, and -how to say it- different in a kind. However, the opening theme could be great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are developed inside the boundaries of classic anime culture. You will remember any character (including main ones), like we have that girl who is impossible to satisfy, the one loving but not taking a step, another one who is unreasonably so excited bla bla bla. I think character development could be better. Especially Kujo running everywhere of school, just screaming \"Viktorique, Viktorique...\" annoys me.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, I really really enjoyed this show. If you want to watch a detective story that somehow touches your heart, you can watch it.",

            "content": "So here's the thing. I wanted to watch a different show. I was getting used to all the action-adventures, all the sci-fis and mechas, and the fantasy worlds. I wanted a different show. So I had heard about Gosick and how it was a mystery show. I found this intriguing because you rarely find mystery-centered anime. Sure, lots of anime have mystery such as Baccano!, Psycho-Pass, and even Attack on Titan at some point, but this is a show that was advertised to me as a mystery-centered anime. So I gave it a shot. It certainly is mystery centered and the mysteries, while not overlycomplicated and clever how I like them, were there almost every episode and did a good job of conveying the shows main theme. So imagine my surprise when I finish the show and the biggest thing that sold it for me was not mystery, but a romance that could parallel Kirito and Asuna and is just shy of being next to Taiga and Ryuuji.\\n\\n\r\nIn the fictional country of Sauville, nestled between France and Italy, in the year 1924, there resides a school. Quite recently, this school started accepting transfer student from all over the world. As much as I almost wish this show went with a Hetalia route by having different cultures interacting with each other, I'm rather glad with what we were given instead. Enter Kujo Kazuya, a transfer student from China. You'd think a person from Asia in an entirely European school would be welcome and the subject of interest for many, however, that is not the case. Most students actively avoid Kujo for one reason: Superstition. You see, the country of Sauville is filled with lore centered around ghost stories. The Clock Tower Alchemist, the Sunken Ship that Still Takes Passengers, and, of course, the Reaper that Comes in the Spring (AKA Kujo...at least that's what the students all think). While exploring the library one day, Kujo makes a startling discover. At the top of the tower is a young girl by the name of Victorique. This chance encounter spurs the entire show and the main mystery that asks \"What is her deal?\" Why is she always in this library? Who is she really? Well, that would be spoiler territory. Anyway, together with Kujo, Victorique ends up helping the Sauville police with various crime cases thank to her 'Wellspring of Wisdom'. How these two always managed to get involved in random grizzly murders is beyond me.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the characters....I don't want to say 'are bad', but they don't bring much to the table. Kujou is an idiot that is there solely for Victorique to explain the mysteries to him, and therefore, the audience, Avril is just a super superstitious girl (who ironically becomes close friends with Kujo) and is the 'potential second love-interest that will never happen', Grevil is there simply to be comedic due to his hairstyle alone, and Cecil is the ditzy teacher that always makes things awkward. Victorique, on the other hand, redeems all of them. She's the only one in the show that I feel developed at all. She's a typical tsundere to the bitter end, but the viewer can still clearly see as her feelings for Kujou, Grevil, and even Avril develop over time.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is good. That's about it. Aside from one scene in the second to last episode that was a joy to watch for the brief time it was displaying, the animation doesn't do a whole lot. However, there was quite a nice contrast between the vividly bright colors in the warmer moments of the shows and how those colors can snap to muted tones to display a darker theme. Overall, it's typical Bones work.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. I have to give credit where credit is due. very few shows manage to make all their themes, both OPs and EDs, as good as Gosick's. Truthfully, I didn't care much for the second ending theme nearly as much as the first, but it was still very well done and fit that latter half of the show perfectly. Background music was also nice, and a good indicator for me about that is that there were moments when I stopped focusing so much on the show itself and sometimes stopped to listen to the music of a certain scene. Of course, there's always a chance that's because I was bored with the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nGosick really isn't a bad show. It does have entertaining moments, albeit mostly coming from Victorique. My main issue is that the mysteries weren't really clever. It seemed at times that the creators just conjured up an idea for how a thing should be solved and threw it in because 'Why Not?' The thing about mysteries is that a good one needs time to be flushed out. And yes, each mystery in Gosick gets at least 2 episodes of content, but much of that is filled with the general lives of the main characters, as opposed to a mystery that focuses solely on said mystery.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this show does bring to the table and it one of the sole reasons I would really recommend someone to watch it is the romance. Kujou and Victorique (spoilers: They're the main romance. I know, quite a shock) have such a weird dynamic, but it works. Kujou is extremely kind and helpful to anyone, whereas Victorique, while having similar qualities, is much less likely to show them and would rather slap Kujou across his boring face. Over time, though, we see the reasons behind Victorique's cold treatment and we see the two develop as a great relationship. This leads to an AMAZING ending that I want to discuss so badly, but it's quite spoilery, so go watch yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSo Gosick isn't a great show by any means, nor is it a bad one. It's perfectly average and some will hate it while other would see it as a masterpiece. If you want something a little different, this show is good enough to satisfy that appetite, but don't expect a 4-course meal.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+Great opening and ending themes\\n\r\n+Very nice background music\\n\r\n+Decent enough animation\\n\r\n+Victorique\\n\r\n+THAT ENDING THO\\n\r\n+Different from many other shows\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-Lackluster characters\\n\r\n-Shotty-at-best mysteries\\n\r\n-Very few things stand out\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I enjoyed Gosick enough to give it an 8/10. However, it took me quite awhile to get to that level of enjoyment and even now I see significant flaws in the show. But, that ending made anything I disliked worth it.",

            "content": "I planed to watch gosick because I love detective serize. After watching tantei gakuen q my expectation was very much about gosick as it is much higher ranked than tantei gakuen q. But I'm really disappointed.\r\nStory: it starts with a very mysterious way, kujo a Japanese guy who is from a soldier family comes to Marguerite where he met victorique and their journey begins. The love story between a common guy and a tsundre loli. The mystrys are good. Since the background is 1924 Europe, it has a vintage feeling. All the stories has sad ending but are good enough to watch. The first partis really nice but the show goes downhill from the second half, specially the last 2/3 episodes are really contradictory to the rest of the episodes. Gosick is an anime which involve brain not muscle power but last few episodes are full of nonsense action and dark theme which doesn't match to the rest of the serize. \\n\r\nArt: pretty much average compared to a 2011 anime. The background art is detailed and nourish our eye but the character art is pretty mediocre. \\n\r\nSound: good. The best part of gosick is sound. The voice actress of victorique have done a great work, it matches beautifully to her personality. Other voice artists are also good. The background music and songs are good.\\n\r\nCharacter: there was a time when the art wasn't good like today's, but had lovely stories and character design. Bitter truth is that most of today's anime has good art but fail to the other two part. There isn't enough depth of the characters. It is very difficult to good characterisation in only 24 episodes. I wish the characters will have more depth.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoy most of the episodes but not the last few. It is a romantic detective anime so I had much expectation from gosick. But last few episodes ruined my enjoyment.\\n\r\nOverall: the ending contribute 50% to the overall rating to my opinion. Gosick fails in this part, probably ending is rushed, may have low budget or something else for bad ending. I don't know why most of the anime ending is frustrating, big potential defeated. Though it seems to be a negative review, gosick is not that bad, probably I was expecting much more from it being a high ranked anime.\\n\r\nThanks for the reading.",

If you want a really good mystery as others have said, then this isn't your place to go. There isn't a lot of violence/blood except during the flashbacks of the mystery. Then you got Kujo accompanying Victorique and all that good stuff. Victorique is super smart, and can solve pretty much every case, whereas Kujo is usually just a tag-along kind of guy, though he does protectVictorique when needed.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10- The art is pretty good coming from the year of 2011. I don't really have anything else to say to it, but no complaints either.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10- I love the sounds, best with headphones on, as another user recommended. I don't know why they've used the same opening to last 24 episodes, but the opening wasn't bad so it was fine. The ending songs were beautiful, however, especially ending 2. Gotta go listen to it!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10- They developed the characters very well. At first I didn't really like Kujo, thinking he was a good-for-nothing guy, but as he develops his friendship with Victorique (and romance) along the way, I thought, \"hey maybe he's not so bad after all.\" Victorique is a smart girl who loves sweets and books, and at first she has a bad attitude and doesn't really have any emotions, but after halfway through the anime, she develops the emotional feelings she's always wanted.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10- I enjoyed this anime a lot, and would rewatch if I want to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10- If you are still hesitating about watching this great piece of work, then you are missing out.

It has a nice beat to it and if you understand the lyrics, you can get some idea of what Gosick is about (or going to for that matter).  The ed song is \"Resuscitated Hope\" which also has an interesting beat to it although the lyrics are quite a bit darker than the op.  The voice acting is pretty good with Victoria's voice actress being the same as Sakura from Kino no Tabi who was the girl Kino met in the 12th episode.\r\nRating: 9\r\nCharacters:\r\nKujo: Knownas the Dark or Spring-time reaper, isn't the brightest Bulb on the Christmas tree for sure but that's ok, Victoria pretty much is.  He's Victoria's gopher for finding new and hopefully interesting crimes to solve.  Gets his nickname from one of the many fairy tales scattered throughout the books in the library.  Like Ryuji from Toradora, he isn't anything like the rumors about him floating around the school.\\n\\n\r\nVictoria (Victorique): The legendary golden fairy detective girl at the top of the library.  Bored from being stuck at the top of the library all this time, she found Kujo and has him find a mystery for her to solve.  Eventually these two become friends or as not so subtly hinted at, probably more.  She is known by two nicknames so far, both from fairy tales that are at the time fairly relevant to the current plot arc.  \\n\\n\r\nGrevil: Takes all the credit for solving crimes that Victoria actually solved.  Plays the role of a \"detective\" that can't actually solve crimes on his own to save his life.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nVictoria and Kujo go an adventures together solving mysteries mainly to entertain Victoria but also partly because they like spending time together.\\n\r\nRating: 8\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nSo far I like watching Gosick.  Depending on how things go in the next few episodes, I may even upgrade it to a 9.  There are already a few arcs that are up and coming that we can see from what has already aired and it will be interesting to see where it goes.\\n\r\nRating: 8-9\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nA pretty decent op/ed, good voice acting, a fairly interesting story and the mystery aspect of it make Gosick probably the best anime running this season.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9",

The visuals, in a nutshell, look fabulous \u2013 this is one of the few series that I would seriously buy in Blu-Ray. The backgrounds are gorgeous and detailed, but not to the point that they stand out too much; somehow, they blend in perfectly. The art on the characters is clean, vibrant, and astonishingly good. It can sometimes be troublesome to tell the more minor characters apart, but all of the primary characters are drawn with an incredible amount of personality and uniqueness. The animation isn\u2019t outstanding,but the show doesn\u2019t have much action so there isn\u2019t much warrant for it. The fight scenes are animated gorgeously, but they\u2019re pretty sparsely placed. The music, too, is good \u2013 the single OP is a nice song, the first ED is absolutely incredible, and the second ED isn\u2019t so bad either. I didn\u2019t pay attention to the BGM most of the time, but whenever I did notice it, it was very good, although a little on the melodramatic side.\\n\\n\r\nGoing beyond the superficial stuff, the characters are very important to this story, and they hardly disappoint. Victorique is, of course, the crown jewel. At first, you\u2019ll think her to be yet another moe-stuffed tsundere, and this impression will probably last for a few episodes. However, as you delve further into the meat of this show, more of Victorique\u2019s history and inner personality rise to the surface, and what you instead find is an incredibly deep, three-dimensional character with a ton of personality. Although she seems very moe at a cursory glance, it becomes apparent later on that her cute tsundere-ness is instead the product of the sheltered, dismal life she lead before the show starts. If you\u2019re a moe lover like me, you\u2019ll fall in love with this girl, no doubt about that. But if moe isn\u2019t your thing, not to worry \u2013 she\u2019s such a complex, interesting character that the tsundere-ness shouldn\u2019t be too off-putting.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other real protagonist of the story is, unfortunately, not quite as masterfully wrought as Victorique is. Kujou, the self-proclaimed \u201cthird son of an Imperial soldier,\u201d is a pretty standard milquetoast-turned-hero character. Not exceptionally smart, strong, or brave, his only real virtue is his utterly bottomless loyalty and sense of duty. This sounds like a good thing \u2013 and in most cases, it is, as his loyalty is the foil to Victorique\u2019s selfishness, and usually drives the pair in the right direction \u2013 but it does produce a worrying archetype that I know puts off people. If you\u2019re tired of the stories where the meek, loyal guy gets trampled on by the dominant, forceful girl, turn back now. Victorique tramples Kujou into the ground with little-to-no respect for most of the story. This will start to wane as their relationship deepens, but you\u2019ll have to bear through it for a long while. I don\u2019t particularly mind it, but I know some people find it irritating, so a warning is only fair.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are not especially worth mentioning here, as none of them are especially interesting either. The main villian is a typical power-hungry villian, the useless third wheel is a typical useless third wheel (think Yoshida, of Shakugan no Shana, but louder and, admittedly, cuter), the schoolteacher is a typical ditzy school teacher, et cetera. I find myself liking these minor characters despite their archetypal natures, but perhaps I am only willing to forgive the show in light of the fantastic main duo.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to the real meat of this show \u2013 the story itself. This is where the show\u2019s biggest failings come into play, and it\u2019s most likely those failings that will determine whether or not you enjoy this show. The first and biggest issue is the beginning: for the first five or so episodes, you\u2019ll most likely experience an odd sensation of discomfort whilst watching. You\u2019ll be presented with this well-written and interesting mystery, involving revenge and murder and other such gruesome stuff \u2013 but in between these interludes of serious, gritty mystery, you\u2019re shown a rather lighthearted teenage romance story, which (as I mentioned before) has a strong moe feeling to it. The two don\u2019t really blend together at the start, and it feels odd, to say the least. This strange, dissonant juggling of themes will lessen after the first two story arcs, then return for a single story arc at the exact middle of the show. Beyond that, the REAL story begins, and the two different themes blend smoothly and beautifully. I thought it was definitely worth it to make it through the start just to get into the real good part, but others may not be so willing.\\n\\n\r\nThe last two-thirds of the show, excluding that story arc right in the middle, is where the viewer is shown the true colors of Gosick. Victorique is no longer just a cute girl who solves mysteries, Kujou no longer the helpless boy who follows her along because he has no other friends (I mean that literally). Victorique\u2019s true past begins to emerge and becomes slowly intwined with the mysteries that follow, and the mysteries themselves usually contribute to a grand scheme that arches over the show as a whole. Kujou suddenly has a reason to follow Victorique along, since the romance between the two deepens dramatically and Kujou\u2019s protective instinct swells by about a million percent. Don\u2019t think that it was too sudden a turn of events, though \u2013 the romance is developed very carefully and near-perfectly. It is undoubtedly the best romantic development I\u2019ve ever seen before, although I haven\u2019t watched or read much romance before so that may not mean much. Anyway, the new mysteries in this part of the show slowly become less innocuous and self-contained, and very gradually weave together seamlessly into a master story that comes to a stunning climax in the last few episodes. To say the least, it\u2019s breath-taking, suspenseful, and incredibly moving.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t without its flaws, unfortunately. I can only think of two things that really mar the proper part of this story, but they seriously irked me. The first is an understandable and somewhat excusable one \u2013 namely, the political side of this story. The political intrigue which plays a part in the latter third of the show was, I feel, most likely well-thought-out, but it failed to fully materialize on the screen. Much of the political structure of Saubure is left unexplained, and the viewer is only given passing references to work with whilst trying to understand the motives and origins of all the political figures at play. It\u2019s not a particularly complex political landscape, but it warrants an explanation, an explanation that doesn\u2019t ever see make its way to the viewers. In fact, it might be preferable to simply not try and understand the politics, but enjoy the story nonetheless. This error isn\u2019t grievous or unforgivable, but it\u2019s not a good feeling to be confused when you\u2019re immersed in such a fantastic story.\\n\\n\r\nThe second issue, however, is something that I believe could have easily been remedied. The show ended at episode 24, which is two episodes less than the standard run of a show of this length \u2013 26 episodes means one every two weeks, 52 weeks making a full year. So they had room to expand \u2013 why did they instead cram the ending into the final few minutes of episode 24? Everything leading up to that last half of an episode is gripping, exciting, perfectly executed, and downright fantastic. But then\u2026 it just ends. Suddenly, everything is over, and we\u2019re given a short, unfulfilling final scene which, for some ungodly reason, not only introduces a new character but also has her obnoxiously talk over the characters we actually care about. Sure, it might have felt a little stretched had they expanded the ending into its own full episode, but that would have been much, much better than the cramped little scene we got instead. Also, cut out that stupid woman. I think her presence alone ruined the ending more than the ending itself. Anyway, rant aside, the ending, whilst definitely a good ending to the story, was a RUSHED good ending. A very, very rushed, good ending. It will deprive you of the finality that an ending should carry, and leave you longing for more. Which isn\u2019t a good thing, considering the show is definitively ended at this point; I highly doubt any sequels will ever come around.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I suspect that those of you who saw the length of this review and said \u201cscrew that\u201d are presently reading this final paragraph. I will summarize for you lazy people: this show is fantastic in pretty much every way except for three main points. One, the politics are poorly explained and executed on-screen; two, the beginning of the show is strange and misleading; three, the ending, while definitely a good ending, was VERY rushed and VERY cramped. In summary, I don\u2019t expect everyone to love this anime despite the issues as I do, but I suggest that you give it a chance. If you watch until the end of episode eight, and still don\u2019t like it, you probably won\u2019t ever get into it. But don\u2019t judge it based on the first five or so episodes, as they are not a good representation of this show as a whole.",

            "content": "You can view Gosick in two different angles. The first angle shows Gosick as a mystery anime and the other one as a romance-drama anime.\r\nI personally disliked its first angle because I find some of the mysteries not interesting, some of it very unrealistic and some are stupid. If this show has its weakness, it would be its mysteries. However if you try to analyze and reflect on the show's ingenuity, these mysteries were but only tools to amplify and support the character development of the MCs namely Kujo and Victorique. \r\nThese mysteries were not really the main point of the show at the endof the day. What really captured me into watching it on high priority and which I consider as its strength was the development of the story that I personally  find excellent and a true ART. seldom would you find an anime in modern times which has a story that of a high caliber literature. It has also shown various political,family,historical and social references such as cultural difference, power,mother's love,religion,money,scientific revolution and war and how these elements can change the world.\\n\\n\r\n It was more spiced up by kujo and victorique's powerful  romance- a timeless tale of \"love knows no boundaries.\" which was exhibited when they were able to overcome all trials and be together again in the end.\\n\\n\r\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH THIS SHOW. You might get bored at the start and may not be well motivated to finish it especially if you're watching it as a mystery anime but I'm telling you now that this show's last episodes has a really powerful magic that will make your knees tremble and your heart race.....\\n\\n\r\n it might even make you write a review about it. \\n",

            "content": "I though this would be similar to Death Note when I first heard about this show, the L(Death Note main character) like main character Victorique de Blois seemed interesting to me so I gave it a shot. This show far exceeded any expectations I had for it, from interesting mysteries to a heartwarming romance with great drama and wonderful bits of comedy and action here and there throughout the show. Gosick is without a doubt one of the greatest shows I have ever seen.\r\nStory: It all starts in the spring of the year 1924 when Kazuya Kujo is sent to Saubure as a transfer studentto St. Marguerite Academy. Here horror stories and urban legends are popular and due to his appearance he is ostracized by his classmates. Once he goes to the library though things begin to change, there he meets a small brilliant girl by the name of Victorique. Victorique is able to solve any mystery you throw at her and as a result is usually asked for help in solving crimes from her brother Grevil. Shortly after they meet Victorique and Kazuya find themselves being thrown into one mystery after another. Throughout the show the story never gets boring as you never know what exactly is going to come next. You may think that the first half of the story is irrelevant to the rest but it places key factors for the second half and not only that you see great character development from both Victorique and Kazuya as well as some interesting mysteries. The second half of the series is where this show truly shines though, from masterful storytelling to even greater character development the second half is just simply amazing.\\n\r\nCharacters: Victorique is a brilliant girl who spends all day in the library of the academy reading books only really leaving it to sleep. She is noted for her small height and long golden hair appearing almost doll-like to people. She hates boredom and loves sweets, though initially cold to Kujo she begins to open up more to him as the series progresses and also has wonderful character development throughout the story.\\n\r\nKujo is a Japanese exchange student who wants to live up to his father high expectations. His appearance getting him a bad reputation from the others at the academy, he doesn't manage to make any friends until he meets Victorique. Throughout the story his character develops quite wonderfully from a boy who just uphold his families honer to a man who wants to protect the woman he loves.\\n\r\nThe side characters of the story provide a good support to the story throughout the series, from the funny moments that help gives the viewer a breather from the drama and mysteries (but yet not to long of a break to make us get bored with the story) to the other side characters help provide with the great drama, mysteries and sometimes though a bit of action as well.\\n\r\nArt and Sound: The art of the show is great as well as it provides good animation and wonder environments with great detail to the people, places and other things as well. The sound of the show was great as well, from great voice actors that fit the characters to a great opening song and two great closings for the show.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The show was very enjoyable from beginning to end from the great mysteries and wonderful romance it managed to keep me guessing what would happen next and also managed to tug the heartstrings at the same time.\\n\r\nOverall: Overall with all of the character developments and the outstanding story, Gosick truly provides a wonderful story from beginning to end which is one of the best anime endings of all time in my opinion. I would highly recommend this anime to anyone who loves mysteries, romances and/or dramas.\\n\r\nThis anime is truly a masterpiece.",

            "content": "I rarely ever review anything I watch. Mostly because of my lack of writing skill. However this anime deserved an exception. I can say honestly after all the anime I've seen that Gosick belongs in my Top 10.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is similar to many others opting for an episode-to-episode structure towards the beginning of the series, with an underlying background plot slowly emerging and overwhelming the story.\r\nHowever this has the effect of shelving many interesting background characters in the later third of the story. Such characters as Avril and Cecile being introduced, developed somewhat, and then abandoned with their stories unfinished.\r\nArt:\r\nWhile not the best I've everseen, the art and animation for Gosick is suitable for the time period, plot and style that the series occupies. In a lot of ways this is all I ask for in a good series.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMy opinion of the sound is almost identical to my thoughts on the art. The series uses all that it needs and doesn't add anything unnecessarily.\\n\\n\r\nHowever what truly shines is the score. The music composed and used by this series sets the tone and matches the plot perfectly and for that I cannot fault it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nReferring back to what I wrote about the plot, many of the characters were executed well and others were seemingly abandoned or given unsatisfying endings. One such character, Avril is seemingly dropped right in the middle of her development.\\n\\n\r\nCliches are also prominent within the Gosick roster, with such tropes as the 'Tsundere Female Protagonist' or 'Whipping Boy Male Protagonist' being the worst offenders. Others such as the 'Secondary Female has unrequited love for the lead' are somewhat understandable due to the circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nDespite what problems the characters may have though, they never fail to be interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed Gosick from start to finish, with never a dull moment. Your mileage on the other hand may vary as the series fits into many of my favourite scenarios and genres.\\n\\n\r\nIndividually the components of Gosick are a little tired and could ruin some other similar anime. When rolled together however, they form a coherent whole with nothing out of place.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf asked whether I recommend Gosick to anyone, I would say yes without question. Even if it isn't the sort of anime you usually like to watch. The reasons I've detailed above show both praise and criticism but always end with a positive opinion overall even after the 'honeymoon period' after finishing the show.",

            "content": "Spoiler free review ahead.\r\nThis is an interesting movie surrounded in mystery. It is centered around two main characters Victorique and Kujo. Victorique is a very interesting character, although a tsundere type but very funny at times, it's seiyuu Yukki Aoi does a great job giving her life, it's amazing to hear her, probably one of the best voice acting out there. Kujo on the other hand has nothing special, quite annoying at times, you don't quite understand what traits Victorique likes about him. \r\nThe story is focused on mystery solving at first, however the biggest mistery which is the main plot gets solved in thevery end, even with 2 episodes to go to the end you quite don't understand the substance of the story. Too great detail is spent on the first episodes and some mysteries which do not add to the main plot, but rather to develop Victorique as a character, albeit not fully as you still do not understand her past and the reason for certain actions of her father. You understand more and you can piece toghether Victorique from her mother's (Cordelia) flashbacks although at a slow pace which leaves you wondering at the end of the episodes if you missed something. \\n\\n\r\nThe last part of the story is rushed, this is where I think this anime fails. It's like the director forgot he has to end it in two episodes and rushes everything haphazardly, skipping plot lines and years. Reading a bit afterwards, it seems that a lot has been omitted from the LN, and what has been omitted is exactly what yo need to fully understand the story. Had they not omitted certain parts, replaced them with others even, this would have been a 10. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like is the atmosphere, the interbellic period with people being happy end enjoying life (theater, shopping, driving) and with other people not quite happy the war is over, is really nicely portrayed although in a fictional setting of Europe. When the second war starts, again a nice portrayal of broken ideals and lifes is made, although a bit sketched as the plot is rushed to finish the show. The ending though is touching, full of symbolism and I personally who had grandparents who lived through the 2nd world war and heard a lot of sad stories about it from them, did feel like the story showed how it must have been back then for them and what they must have gone through the war and after. Although rushed, it's really good. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing, some scenes are wonderfully drawn and in big detail, even Victorique's clothes have a lot of detail as lolita dresses which are nice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, I really liked the end credits song and Aoi Yuuki's voice acting which is amazing, must have been her best year for voice acting Victorique and Madoka. Apart from this there is no memorable music to go with the scenes.",

            "content": "Gosick. This show is a masterpiece and earned a 10/10 from me. The story is about a boy studying abroad post WWI in Europe, but his timing pretty much makes him an outcast. Kazuya Kujo doesn't seem to really care about it too much, which adds to his character of still being kind to everyone. It is here he meets Victorique de Blois and their friendship starts from there. It is a drama-packed, historical mystery.\r\nStory~9\r\nThe story was superb, albeit taking it's time to start. It doesn't really hook you in until later in the series as the first few episodes mainly build up each characters'reputation and well as showing off skills to impress the audience. As you may have surmised, Victorique is a genius, who taps into her \"Fountain of Wisdom\" to solve mysteries to tackle her listlessness. We mainly see Kujo as her lapdog, simply doing as he is told and is often the go-between of Victorique and the rest of the world. However, as the story progresses, this third son of an Imperial General has to take on more responsibilities and is open to adversaries to protect the things he cares about. Even Victorique herself is very mysterious, dubbed the \"Golden Fairy\" of the schools' library. With his less than perfect sleuthing skills, but big heart, the story is also driven by an aspect of romance.\\n\\n\r\nArt~10\\n\r\nOne of the best animations out there, at least of its time, the art is elegant to reflect it's historical European setting. Aspects of Japanese interpretations of English and French watercolor is the main feature of the art, whilst keeping up with its Japanese art-syle, staying true to its anime roots. The attention to detail is great, though there are some quirks as with all mystery animations. In real life crime dramas, evidence is always in front of the detectives, though it is there duty to interpret the data. In Gosick, being an animation, evidence is simply edited in to the story after it is discovered, obviously because that is how easy animation makes it. It is not uncommon for mysteries to baffle even the sharpest of knives because of how animation is able to abuse its privilege of simply changing the scenes. It isn't as bad as Detective Conan where crime scenes are totally manipulating in the comically most convoluted ways possible. Gosick will leave its mark on viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSound~8\\n\r\nThe music is great, as it is a drama mystery, so background music is very important for setting tone. Gosick does its' job delivering great music to accompany the delicate scenes as well as the important game changers. However, sometimes, these will be drowned out by the attention the audience pays trying to solve the crimes themselves. Thus, it serves its purpose , in a way, helping one focus. The anime also has its' own musical soundtracks that are semi-important to the plot. These songs help to aid transitions and convey emotions, to which they are made to appeal. If anything more was done, the show probably would have felt overdone, so it's good just the way it is\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~9\\n\r\nThe first few episodes serve to introduce the main characters with smaller subplots of various crimes. After that, the main story takes over, which still further develops the characters, even going into their personal histories. Development is abundant in this anime, and just about every character has an explorable backstory. There's even a reason why Victoriques exploitative older brother wheres his hair in a \"french horn/unicorn\" style(?). The characters are well done, especially Kujo and Victorique, especially as their relationship deepens. Villains have genuine motive and case-by-case every culprits' motive is calculated in a way that makes sense to the audience, instead of throwing facts together and hoping they work well together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment~8\\n\r\nEnjoyment is an 8 because I understand how the first few episodes may have deterred a few people away. A romance anime that didn't take off very quickly; crimes solved where the detective got no credit; set in a fancy school but seldom ever depicting scenes there and the list goes on. One you make it past the first two crimes, the mood is totally set. It'll make you want to watch everything all at once, because of how interactive mystery anime are by nature. Plus, the romantically dimwitted Kujo will leave everyone in either amused or bereft themselves, on how he handles his women ;] The overall plot deals with mystery in the sense that truths are hidden, not in the sense that a crime is committed and someone must solve it. However, by incorporating both, Gosick is created, combing both the child detective tropes and the \"you know my name not my past\" trope as well. The problem is not even that specific character know their past that much either. This gives way to another subplot of finding ones' identity in a seemingly cruel and manipulative world. This is important because it takes a good deal of memory to be fully immersed in this anime...\\n\\n\r\nOverall~10\\n\r\nThis anime is simply superb. the artwork and characters are great. the story, with all of its' subplots and oddities create a wonderful tale about friendship trying to survive at all costs, or the mysteries that will consume both main characters. Kujo and Victorique are victims of fate, but that very thing brought them both together in the first place. It is up to them to decide what they will do with their partnership and up to you the audience to find out what exactly that entails.",

Of course there are background stories for all characters, and there is no need of telling it'd tip to being a mysterious one...\r\nAnyway, a MYSTERIOUS girl, dressed fashionably, was foundin a tippy top of a building, by that sidekick of boy I mentioned earlier. At first impression, the girl was unfriendly, one you obtain for being secluded for quite a while. Kind of a sherlock vibe, but I just can't take a girl, that looked like a doll seriously and since the series seems to want a serious, kind of, like 1/4 of the story, well, that's ruined. That's just isn't logical. Top it off with being secluded all her life? Reading into people's mind pattern, scenarious, solving those \"crimes\", is like your watching a cartoon... oh wait... guess you can't take these things seriously... but the story did want a 1/4 seriousness in their end, If the vibe I got was correct.\\n\\n\r\nThe sidekick is typical, a stumbling idiot, narrating the whole thing, THE john watson. Typical meaning rightous, you know what I mean in a typical anime MC, ones that aren't trying to be funny.\\n\\n\r\nOh.. just realized, there was this police officer, a detective, who is taking the credit of the girl's solved crime. with permission, with the help.\\n\\n\r\nHa.. a complete rip off, with just some added shinanigans of an anime. \\n\\n\r\nend...",

It can be taken as an example of a miracle between two lovers in distant lands, or it can be taken as a lesson that anything is possible when you have hope.  Interpreting the meaning of this anime is almost impossible for me.\r\nThis was really a rollercoaster for me, but it ended up at 9.2/10.  The first episode gave an essence of it having a typical romance/comedy type of thing and at that point I really didn't expect much from it.  But I decided to watch on, and I've seenit in a different light.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.5/10\\n\r\nEven though, the anime didn't show all the things in the novel (or I am presuming that it didn't), I was quite satisfied with it.  Actually, I was really satisfied.  The story development over time was one of the things I admire in this anime.  It wasn't full of excessive violence that will take away the main focus of the story, but was just enough to show the stress and the intensity in it.  The love development was also something to admire, even though it was already predictable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\r\nThe art and detail in this anime was excelent.  It really gave you the feeling of Europe in that era.  Also, it also went with the mood of the scenes.  It wasn't excessive with fancy colors, but was enough to be well portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nOne of the best BGM tracks I have heard.  Each one fit the scene it was set almost perfectly, especially at the scenes where the characters show emotion of sadness and desperation of seeing each other.  Of course the comedic BGM tracks were also admirable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5\\n\r\nEach of the protagonists were really well developed throughout the story.  The emotional development between the two was really something.  The protagonists are good, but the side characters fit their roles really well.  Each one contributed to the emotional sense of the story, even those ones you will only see in one episode.  They were also entertaining at times as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the story as a whole, but I really would love some type of follow up in the story, or something that would describe each of the protagonists adventures and feelings between the times where they were seperated and the end.  That is the only thing I want to see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAs I said in the beginning, I gave this series a deserving 9.2 (if not, higher).  Definitely one of the best animes out there.",

            "content": "Gosick an mystery and shounen show that takes place in 1924. The main characters are Kazuya Kujo and Victorique. When watching this show I felt like Victorique carried the show and making me kind of sad of the lack of other character development. I really like Victorique in the show, but she had to much weight in carrying the show. Music is decent nothing really special that stands out to me. It did its job and went well with the show. What surpises me though that Kotaro Nakawgawa made the soundtrack and yet he made music for Code Geass R1 and R2, GunxSword, and BambooBlade. So, with that he has made soundtrack that you can listen without watching the show, but this show doesn't have that. Director is Hitoshi Nanba and I know him making Eureka Seven. Besides that he hasn't directed other shows I've seen or just been a helper in others such as a pokemon movie and Lupin the 3rd (movie). Studio Bones has made this show and they have done works like Fullmetal Alchemist and Brotherhood, Darker than Black, and Soul Eater. So, when I saw bones made this show I was expecting the animation to be good and they didn't let down there. This show was very consistent with the animation, and made it one good show. The story to me in the beginning was a bit better, because I like that weekly mystery cases they did. That wasn't a problem, but I personally wished they stick to the beginning more. I give this anime a 6.5 out of 10",

Well, without adding any spoilers i have to say that this anime made me laugh, it made me cry and most importantly, it made me really feel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, including my enjoyment, I will give this a 9/10 as this anime really touched me, even if it isn't the best anime ever, it is definetly one of the best in its genre.\\n\r\nIf you like this kind of show that is both romance and a bit of mystery, then this is definetly for you.  \\n\\n",

There he becomes friends with an extremely intelligent but arrogant and shrewish girl, who is fond of sweets and solving complicated mysteries.

Ok, he had a crush on her, but not minding her hitting and humiliating him was just irritating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 7\\n\r\nA good anime to pass my time, but all those 'thorns' I mentioned left a bittersweet taste after I finished it.

There is no real overarching premise or plot that you could really call \"A story\". It sometimes pretends like its a romance but it isn't, it sometimes pretends like it's a mystery show but it isn't, it sometimes (laughably) pretends that it's anaction show but it isn't. Note that it is NOT a \"Mystery show\" in the vein of Detective Conan....  The viewer can never solve the mystery because we are not given enough information, but it masquerades as a mystery show which is fine because the subplot stories were at least somewhat interesting.   \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of setting it starts off as sort of a post WW1 pre WW2 (Mid 1920s Europe) pseudo mystery show with a pretty strong grounding in reality but then falls off of a cliff and becomes about \"ELVES!!! MAGICK!!! SPLOSIONS!!!\" completely ruining the setup it had created. World War 2 (Or what is its equivalent) occurs literally within a few minutes of an episode. They spent more time 'foreshadowing' it than anything.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the setting is all but abandoned and it has no distilled thesis; \\n\r\nIt is thread-bare plot with the flimsiest of justifications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nSome of the locations , designs , backgrounds and objects designed for this show are beautiful... probably not period specific but still very beautiful and striking to the eye. I greatly enjoyed absorbing a lot of the lovely architecture , vehicles and even clothing. If you are the kind of person that puts a lot of stock in visuals, this show is a good investment of time... especially if you have an eye for detail.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThere is only one character. Victorique (ka) Every other character is a \"Caricature\" or an inconsistent , ultra clich\u00e9d mess. The male lead (Kujo) is a complete joke.... he starts out assertive, as a proper foil to the overbearing Victorique but is quickly castrated to the point where he's just her foot-stool only after 1/3rd of the show has passed.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are little more then window-dressing for the interactions shared by Victorique and Kujo... but as I stated, since Kujo's characterization is inconsistent and clich\u00e9d, Victorique has no foil to bounce off of so she gets old fast (Unless you like one-man shows).\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization is incredibly poor across the board, we don't know why characters do the things they do almost during the entire show. The few character traits we get are very flimsy and do not justify the behavior of some of these characters. I do not want to spoil it but suffice to say, a great deal of the overarching 'plot' relies on \"BWAHAHAHA /Mustache Twirl\" characterization.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI wanted to love this show because the setting is absolute dynamite (Post WW1, Pre WW2 Europe) and the pseudo mystery vibe it held  but it simply does not hold up. From a promising start it goes downhill fast eventually completely collapsing in on itself.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a terrible show that I do not recommend to anyone other than people that desperately want to see some lovely architecture and settings. The visuals are the only saving grace... but visuals alone cannot save this debacle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\ngg",

            "content": "Mysteries always seem to tantalize people's minds.  The idea of an unsolved murder case, or a missing valuable that has seemed to disappear out of thin air, or even the sudden reappearance of a supposed missing individual has always made people curious or intrigued.  And when you have an anime that combines the idea of mysteries solved by a gothic lolita that is the equivalent of an anime Sherlock Holmes?  Now, you've got something interesting.\r\nStory (6.84/10):  After WWI, In the imagined country of Sauville, located somewhere on the edge of the Mediterranean sea, a Japanese boy, the third son of animperial soldier named Kazuya Kujo, better known as the Reaper that comes in Spring, is transferred into a prestigious academy where one day, he is told to go up to the library, where he meets our main female protagonist Victorique rolling on the floor out of sheer boredom.  And with this faithful encounter, the two embark on their fantastic journey filled with mysteries and stories.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I think is great about this story is the fact that it focuses purely on mystery and no other anime genre like supernatural or adventure.  The show features many little mysteries spanning about three or so episodes per mystery.  Each mystery ranges from something that is fairly straightforward to seemingly improbable or convoluted, each of them involving a ghost story or fairy tale that the made up country of Sauville is filled to the brim with.  For a good majority of the show, this is the formula that it follows, which actually worked well for the show, seeing how it mainly focused on mystery, but, in the last ten or so episodes, they scrap that idea for the sake of an \"overarching\" plot.  \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the show I feel was mediocre at best.  It felt sort of forced upon when it came along, as the entire plot of the second half focused on a \"villainous plot\" that was rather generic and filled with flaws.  There was still the whole arcic setup of mysteries every so often in this second half, but they always seemed to take a backseat rather than be the focus point at the time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show felt a little bit off in some sense.  The second half of the show sort of just threw stuff at you and failed to fabricate a proper plot since there were a few plot holes and lack of explanation that I felt the show really could've used.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ending sort of felt rushed.  While we do get a rather happy ending whose result is up to the imagination of the viewer, it sort of skipped over a lot of things, essentially doing a four year timeskip that was well...weird.  It didn't feel like it coincided well with the story of the show and felt completely different from what we were presented at first, so it didn't have what I would call a pleasing effect.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I would've preferred the entire show to be its first half of mysteries because it was what we were presented with first, and it worked for the series in its favor.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Great first half\\n\r\n+  Good mysteries\\n\r\n-   Mediocre \"overarching plot\"\\n\r\n-   Somewhat rushed ending\\n\r\n-   Several plot holes\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6.93/10):  Up first is the only character that you would probably care about in this entire series, Victorique.  Victorique is the singlehandedly most important character in this show, as practically EVERYONE revolves around her.  Being a rather smart girl the size of a life-like doll, Victorique is incredibly intelligent, solving mysteries by using her \"wellspring of wisdom\" to assemble the fragments of chaos and reconstructing how the action was committed, who committed the crime, and the motives, all while smoking a pipe before complaining how simple the mystery was and rolling on the floor in boredom.  What I love about her is how complicated of a character she actually is, where she can be cool and collected in one scene, then making cute kawaii faces in the next, before fuming in anger by puffing up her cheeks.  While Victorique is a very complicated and rather well made character, her castmates are well...average at best.\\n\\n\r\nKazuya Kujo is the main male protagonist in the series.  Kujo is a rather boring male protagonist, being the nice guy and trying to help out and protect the delicate princess.  Kujo's entire character is defined by Victorique.  Literally, everything he does is for the her sake, to the point that he would even sacrifice his own life for her.  While this is a commendable trait for his character, there is literally NOTHING else to him in terms of traits, so he's sort of unimpressive.  Plus, he says \"VICTORIQUE!\" like fifty times per episode, so there's a reason to be a bit tired of his character.\\n\\n\r\nFor the rest of the characters, they are split into two categories.  The first one being suspect characters, characters who are suspects to their perspective mysteries, and constant characters, characters who stay prominent in the series as a whole.  While the suspect characters get a pass due to the fact that get minimalistic screen time and only serve to push the mystery along, the constant characters don't.\\n\\n\r\nThe constant characters don't really have very much to them, as they are just generic character troupes that you can find pretty much anywhere.  We have the teacher who wants everyone to be friends, the secondary female who will never admit her feelings, and....ice cream cone head.  Aside from filling up the cast, and serving some sort of minimal role, the side characters were more or less made to exemplify Victorique and her importance to the story.  They basically improved her, whilst failing to improve themselves.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Victorique\\n\r\n-  Generic main male lead\\n\r\n-  Generic side cast\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.62/10 and 7.35/10): Gosick was created by Studio Bones, a studio that has notoriously been marked by a being very good at making very good looking animation, and this show is no different.  Gosick has a very detailed and very crisp and clear look to it.  Everything in the show is rather detailed and very nice to look at.  (Just look at the amount of detail put on Victorique herself.  She wears frills, a lot of them.  Imagine the amount of work needed to make her dresses, and she wears many different ones in the series.)\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music, the show consists of 1 opening, and two endings.  Along with a very storybook-looking style for the opening's art, we have a track that I felt deserved to be listened to every time I watched this series because I felt like it had a very distinct sound that related to the fact that the entire series revolved around stories that related to the mysteries at hand.  It also sounds very whimsical and rather nice.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of its endings, Gosick has two.  Each of them has its own sound with the theme of a melancholic tone that relates to Victorique's character.  While both of these endings are good in its own right, as they have their own unique sound and are not generic sounding in any way, I would've preferred the series stay with the same ending song like it did with its opening, as I feel as though the first ending sounds better and a bit more fitting for the series.  Don't change something that's already good, am I right?\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Very nice looking art\\n\r\n+  Good music\\n\r\n-   Unnecessary ending song change\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.11/10):  Like many people who've watched this series, I prefer the first half of the series due to the fact that it was what was presented first and worked towards the series's favor.  When the second half rolled in, the series felt sort of meh to me, as the story was somewhat broken and you're given information that unless you're Victorique, the fragments of chaos wouldn't make a whole story.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of Victorique, I felt as though the series put WAY too much emphasis on her.  While yes, I agree that she is a fantastic character who boasts a lot of complexity and character all in a cute little package, the show made her too much of a focal point to the point that the entire cast relies on her for any sort of characteristics.  (They even go to the point of saying \"Victorique presents\" when they reveal the name of the show in the opening.)\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show's mysteries.  The fact that they created these mysteries that made me think a little bit, as well as making connections from one story to the next, making you pay attention to every detail for fear of missing anything later on, was a good and unique approach for the show.  But because this idea was scrapped for the sake of a more focused plot that put even more focus on Victorique, it didn't feel necessary and sort of made the show a little bit less enjoyable.  \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, if you wish to have a good mystery show that is for the most part based on actual mystery, then Gosick is certainly the show to go forth, as the show has some rather good mysteries, and some pretty funny and memorable moments.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score:  (7.23/10)",

            "content": "This is my first Review, so give me the benefit of the doubt here. \r\nThis anime, when i first saw it, didnt think much of it, and just moved on to another anime to watch. Then, one day i though, what the hell, the synopsis is what made me think twice about watching it. So, i started watching it, and was happily and surprisingly amazed at this anime. The first couple episodes started off slow, at first, then picked up right away. This anime is my all time fav. and still is. \r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story, a romantic, drama and somewhat of a mystery in myopinion. This is the most appealing thing about this anime. The Story unfolds and begins to hint at a little ongoing mystery throughout the entire show. It had me hooked and i loved every episode, even if it didnt continue on the main story everytime. Each episode has action, or suspense, comedy, and the romance to keep you drawn in. This is the light of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful and well done. Vibrant colors and good charecter designs. None of them irritated me and i loved watching it. \\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nThe sound was great, the ending song for the first half being my fav. of any anime so far. It just seemed to fit after each episode ends, and is still stuck in your head after you stop watching it. The voice acting was good, no really annoying characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9\\n\r\nNow, this is my second fav. part of this anime. Victoria, and yuji i think thats how you spell there names, are the stars of the show. Vic. growing from a silent, mean girl, to eventually opening up throughout the show. Yujji, who is weak, still manages to make you smile with his determination. He befriends Vic. and manages to get under her shell, making her open up to him, and ultimatley rely on him. The romance between these two are comedic and funny, and heartwarming. Toward the end of the series, i swear i felt tears, it was sad, but no spoilers about that. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoymen: 10\\n\r\nI Really enjoyed this anime, and recommend it to anyone who wants a light romantic, comedy with some mystery and action thrown in. Dont judge a book by its cover like i did. Trust me.",

            "content": "This is one of the few anime that I personally have approved of and given a score of all 10's across the board. \r\nThis series itself presents a lot of elements that just added up to the masterpiece that is Gosick. Despite not understanding the title, the whole series was a rejuvenation of the traditional mystery genre mixed with dark secrets of its own.\r\nStory gets a 10 out of 10. It starts out as a regular story with the main protagonist in a situation that he himself either cannot control or has done something that will start the process of the entire story. Now thisseries does something interesting from usual anime and involves history (although very minor, such as WW1 and WW2).  Although the series was based in a fictional country it still showed the interactions of people and places as if in actual history and life during that time period. Science was taking a big part in the world around that time and the argument of Magic VS Science was strong. Even though the series starts out like this it takes things gradually and smooths into each part of the story and connects different parts that would never seem to be connected. It goes from mystery of different murder cases then eases into mysteries connected with the main characters and then the plot is soon revealed.It was well drawn out, very suspenseful at times, and the ending was beautiful, a tear-jerking moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art work also receives a 10 out of 10. To break it down simply, the backgrounds from the school, the maze, the library and clock tower, and the characters were all drawn to detail, the mixed colors that stood out and gave the anime a beauty few can compare. Yes for most of the character they were not as impressive but different from the usual anime we see blonde hair, since this series takes place other than Japan for the majority. The individual characters are gorgeous. The main female has a lovely transformation as well. The different fight scenes, especially ones with fire gives an intense feeling and the series didn't need an over excess of blood gore to make it good. The series even did the seasons, which was played out well. More could be said for the art that I can't do justice- but watch the series and find out.\\n\\n\r\nSounds of the anime Gosick were just as great as the art. 10 out of 10. The reason for this- all the songs used, from the opening to the two endings made me want to constantly sing to them and fit perfectly with the series and the opening sequences and ending sequences. The opening was very upbeat and the endings were both enchanting and lovely. The second ending was a duet and I can see how it fit wonderfully with the series. Again watch the series and listen for yourselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters- 10 out of 10. I enjoyed watching the two main protagonists go at it and encounter all the obstacles throughout the series, because the ending was worthwhile. Their [Kujo and Victorique] relationship was something truly out of a fairy tale and something beautiful. An innocence and child-likeness. The series did a great job of giving each character their own personality and backgrounds and traits that were specifically theirs and I didn't see as generic. They had backgrounds that were well explained and clear. The relationships and bonds presented from start to finish was detailed and surreal (at least to me).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Both 10 out of 10. I enjoyed this series to the point of writing this review in hopes in getting others to watch and re-watch it. The music, the art, and the complete story and characters strong enough to cheer for and to hate made this series a worthwhile adventure to watch. I'll certainly rewatch and it's again a real water-works starter and that you can sympathize with the characters and fall in love.",

Basically my rating is kinda divided to two parts:\r\nThe first 2/3 part has a decent mystery,not really thought-provoking but the story is pretty enjoyable and I give it a 8.\r\nThe last 1/3 part, on the other hand, has more complex plot and more interesting mystery with a few plot twists, the drama also become considerably heavier and for this I give it a8,5.\\n\r\nSo my final score is 8,25/10 for the story. \\n\\n\r\nFor character the mc kinda annoyed me since he kept shouting victorique's name for god knows how many time, his personality is a bit flat throughout the series and he's someone who would just go along with the flow. The heroine is a tsundere (a loli tsundere to be precise) with a genius brain, she's kinda mysterious but she does have a backstory which is explained in the anime. By the end of the series I really love them both seeing how much they developed and how much effort they done to deal with the struggle.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much mystery anime that also has both romance AND drama in it. And this anime did a good job at that, also the ending is just perfect.",

            "content": "GoSick. This anime takes place in 1920s Europe. It starts off with this young 15 year old Japanese boy studying abroad in this small country called Sauville. He attends a prestigious academy there due to having excellent marks and grades, but while being academically proficient, he isn't socially. Due to him having black hair and eyes, he is commonly referred to as the black reaper; a ghost story within their little country. He tries his best to make friends, but he is finding it surprisingly difficult to do so. One day, while finding books for class, his curiosity and interest sparks when he hears astory from classmates about a golden fairy who resides atop the library tower. So, being the highly curious person he is, he climbs the staircases to the top. Atop, rather than finding a fairy, he finds a childlike girl with long golden hair, sitting on the floor, while being surrounded by books. Destiny would bring them together for the meeting that would change their lives.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\n- The opening and ending music were spectacular and marvelous. Amazing for an anime in my opinion. The background music is quite nice too. Sweet piano pieces and music from the Early 20th century is what you will get here and maybe some light jazz once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n- The art in this anime was fine. Its good and I would sometimes find it funny and laugh at it. It is really clean and beautiful but I wouldn't rate it higher than other animes such as X or Vampire Hunter D\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a great anime and if you are interested in an anime involving mystery, this one is one I would most definitely recommend. I loved this Anime! Have a great day!",

I mean has the author actually visited Europe in his life? I am not a European myself. But I am absolutely certain that Europeans aren't like Japanese in the slightest. Sauville's weird superstitious cult,(hardly makes sense since France has always been traditionally Catholic Christian) culture, religious ceremonies,(since when Europeans have used spears that look like Japanese yari?) the way people talk to one another,(if the author used the Harry Potter series as a reference material this would've ended up much better) that'sall based on Japanese customs not European. Kujou Kazuya is one of the most obnoxious halfwit protagonists in the anime history. How can anyone put up with this guy? Seriously........\\n\\n\r\nThis would've looked much better if the story actually took place in Japan instead. \\n\\n\r\nBah who am I to blame? Most westerners can't tell the difference between Chinese, Japanese and Korean anyway. So I suppose it's understandable that Japanese have these weird misconceptions about western culture just as westerners do of Japan and other East Asian countries. \\n\\n\r\nI gave 8 only because I like solving mysteries. Also that theme song performance in English was very beautiful.",

            "content": "I will try to keep this review simple and concise. Please keep in mind that this is my first review and that it is not objective.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nI initially went into Gosick expecting a Sherlock Holmes type mystery show set in the 1920s. Little did I know how far away from the truth I was. Gosick does have many detective style mystery solving arcs but they all make up a big political clusterfuck near the end. This was a very pleasant and unexpected turn of events that really makes Gosick stand out from your typical Scooby Doo type mystery anime. I can say with confidence thatI believe this is Gosick's strongest selling point. \\n\r\nWith that being said, there are several things that bothered me as well, notably the romance aspect of the show. I dont know how many people share this sentiment but I think this show would have been infinitely better without the romance, especially considering how clich\u00e9 it was. I will further explain this point later on in the review\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good but nothing to write home about either. For 2011, I would say it's normal and pleasant to look at. Aside from Victorique and Grevil though, most of the characters look like they could be pulled out of another anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nI don't really focus too much on extra elements like sound and art unless they really stand out so please bare with me. The soundtrack, especially the OP and ED, are pretty nice but that's about it. IMO, there was nothing really noteworthy about the soundtrack but that might be because I usually don't pay much attention to it. Either way, it wasn't great nor bad, it was fitting and decent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nNow this is where, in my opinion, Gosick fails the most: the characters.\\n\r\nLet's start off with Kujo, a harem anime protagonist that somehow got placed into a political mystery anime. Just by looking at his appearance, you can tell that this guy will be your typical cheesy main character. He's basically just there to be the tolken Japanese guy with no personality that somehow manages to attract every relevant female character. He's generally useless expect for his role in helping Victorique grow as a character. Even then, one could argue that Victorique was more interesting before Kujo came along. At least before she wasn't  a damsel in distress every other episode. One thing that really boggled my mind was how smart the guy supposedly is but how he is so hellbent on becoming a solider! What the hell is that about? Why even go to study abroad then. However the worst part of it all is how often he says \"Victorique\". This kid can't go 5 minutes without screeching \"Victorique\". I mean for god's sake he probably says \"Victorique\" more often than Yuno Gasai says \"Yukki\" and I'm not even exaggerating! \\n\r\nNext up is Victorique, the super smart loli that solves all these cases. Seriously, at the end of this anime there is a time skip and she's still a loli! I have no fucking idea why they decided to make her a loli, especially if they wanted to make a romance anime but fuck it. Anyways that's not what's important about her. Victorique, as a characters that was supposedly deprived from love and has the mind of a genius, was probably the most interesting. Nevertheless, she is a hardcore tsundere after Kujo comes and I personally despise tsunderes. For me, this made her insufferable at times. \\n\r\nThen we have the supporting cast like Avril, Grevil and Cecil. Aside from one case, Avril is irrelevant and is basically an annoying third wheel. Grevil is your typical eccentric weirdo with a hairstyle( if you can even call it that) that would put the 80s to shame. And Cecil is just the funny and nosy sensei.\\n\r\nNothing is really remarkable about the main antagonist either except that some of his actions made no sense although that's going into spoiler territory. \\n\\n\r\nNow considering the two MCs archetypes, one can see that this romance ends up being pretty generic. A tsundere and a cheesy naive male? Gee, I wonder how that will turn out! *cough*sarcasm*cough* \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7/10 \\n\r\nDespite the shit I gave this anime for its characters, the main plot was pretty enjoyable and thrilling. It was especially satisfactory to see all the dots connected at the end. Yes the shitty romance and cliche ending did ruin some of it for me, but I tried ignoring it for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is a solid anime, despite the clich\u00e9s. I would recommend this anime to anyone looking for an interesting political mystery anime, so long as they can endure the romance and cheesiness that is. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my first review. I would appreciate any constructive criticism or tips.",

The characters around him were all great.\r\nAnimation and Sounddepartments will not hear any complaints from me. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, i'd absolutely recommend this anime, I was quite irritated by the MC, but once the rest of the cast is on screen it becomes a lot more enjoyable.",

            "content": "Studio Bones knows how to make a good anime or at least an interesting one to say the least. This ranges from Full Metal Alchemist to the ever popular Soul Eater. Seasoned storyboard worker turned director for the anime Gosick was given to Hitoshi Nanba (Area 88, Captain Tsubasa).\r\nGosick is about a Japanese kid, Kazuya, moving to basically southern France (fictional place called Sauville) and happens upon a mysterious loli blond French girl in the upper library. Together they slowly form a sort-of friendship while solving various mysteries they happen upon.\r\nIt\u2019s not often a mystery anime comes to light much like any within the horrorgenre. More often than not those anime fail to hit the mark and their various ways. Unfortunately, Gosick fall directly within the lines of this problem. A series focused on mysteries being solved either come off as ridiculous and implausible, or overly simplistic and unimaginative. The first mystery is solid enough, but as the series continues each new mystery seems worse and less interesting than the one previously. Besides, the loli known as Victorique and her banter with blank slated character Kazuya nothing really happens. Side characters often make nothing more than a cameo appearance to advance to the next mystery or what have you. Even driving forces behind the two main characters offer nothing more than what was told such as Kazuya\u2019s father is rich and wants his son to succeed, no other personality or traits to be known or shown.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the character Victorique herself, there is not much to Gosick. Victorique runs the show by herself be it a wide evolving range or personality or even to the showmanship of her solving a weak told mystery. A saving grace are elements to each mystery carry over into the next instead of a \u201cmystery-of-the-week\u201d sequence. Not to say Gosick is totally saved from this, but it helps the show from falling completely into a bad rap. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, Gosick has a decent main character in Victorique while the show suffers from mostly everything else. It will hit the viewer with a lot of imagery and crash land them into endless amounts of information that comes off as important, but amounts to nothing most of the time. It just is not a good mystery show worth recommending.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a good crime fiction anime, Gosick is not it. If you're looking for a historically accurate mystery anime, Gosick is still not it. Finally, if you're looking for an experienced reviewer, then this review definitely isn't the one you're looking for. \r\nThis is my first review, actually, and it was prompted simply by how good this series is. \r\nDespite the wording of the synopsis, Gosick really is neither about ghosts or alchemists. Those are simply pieces in a much larger chess game. What Gosick really is about, is a romance between a most unlikely pair who become entangled in matters thatare far beyond their control. It is a story about power as much as it is a story about people. It is a story about hardship and determination.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nMake no mistake, the nothing about this anime is perfect, but in my opinion, this is as close as it's possible to get. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the very first episode, from the very first, seemingly humorous and cheerful meeting between our protagonists, the story of Gosick has already begun. This anime has no fillers, no useless frames. Like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, they fall together, and it's not until the very last few episodes of this show can you see the entire picture. Every single bit of seemingly useless information, every single fact of every minor arch, in fact ties in to the grand tale being told. If for this reason alone, I must give Gosick a 10.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is much more to say about the Story. This anime has a great distribution of humor, angst, mystery and, most importantly, heart-warming romance.   The pacing, all series considered, is just about right and, finally, the ending fits the plot perfectly (no spoilers). \\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who are here for the mystery, there is an ample amount throughout the anime, although it is true that the second half of the anime has far less than the first half. The mysteries themselves, however, are extremely well designed, in my opinion, and definitely reminded me of those old who-dun-it crime novels, or Sherlock Holmes shows. They have the same tricky cleverness, the same clues, and the same twisted endings that any crime lover is sure to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who are here for the romance, you most definitely won't be disappointed. If you have watched Zero No Tsukaima and remember the part where Saito and Louis are separated for a time, well this anime gives you a similar feeling. For those of you who haven't watched Zero No Tsukaima, go watch it (after you finish Gosick, of course). Without giving anything away, hopefully, I will say that this series has one of the most satisfying, and somewhat more realistic, romances I've seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhew! So that was a LOT about the story, but to be honest I can go on and on about the other aspects for paragraphs too . . . but I won't, don't worry.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 10\\n\r\nI put art and sound together for a very simple reason. I feel that the best art and sound should fit seamlessly into a show and you shouldn't notice it at all. It should add to the experience and not distract you, but amplify and enhance everything you feel. To that end, I definitely feel that Gosick achieves a 10. I'm not talking about the opening and ending songs, because if you like those you can just go on youtube or something and find them. The music you hear IN the anime, however, perfectly suit each situation, and the art is both detailed and realistic for the time it is set in. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nCharacter is a big one, and as odd as it sounds, I actually will say very little on the subject because there is simply so much to say. Every character feels three dimensional - that is to say, they feel like real people, as if this series was based on a real story. They change, they grow, and they find their way into your heart. There is not a single character in this show that I would say I dislike, except perhaps the villains. Even the villains I have to appreciate, for just how, well, villainous they can be, without sounding insane. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, and thus Overall: 10\\n\r\nThe best way to sum up everything I've said is like this: I'm sure this anime has its flaws, like every anime. However, after finishing it, I can't remember any of them. Gosick has an overwhelmingly beautiful story, portrayed by well designed art and sound, told through amazing characters. At no point in this anime did I look for flaws, because I was simply enjoying the tale. It took me so long to watch it because, to be honest, I wasn't sure about it after reading the synopsis, but I'm certainly glad I did. Gosick is definitely in my top 10 must watch list.",

            "content": "About:\r\nGosick is more a series produced by studio Bones (Ouran High School Host Club, FMA, FMA Brotherhood) and displayed on TV Tokyo. Its director is Hitoshi Nanba, who has been on the staff of Eureka Seven and Heroman.\r\nThe story revolves around the young Kazuya Kujo, transfer student from Japan to study in the fictional country of Saubrere (Europe between France and Spain). On a visit to the school library giant, Kujo is Victorique of Blois, a student who does not attend classes and spend all your time studying and reading books. It is from this meeting that the story begins to develop and new charactersare revealed, as the British transferred Avril Bradley, magician Brian Roscoe, maquis (and arch-villain Alberto de Blois) and Cordell Gallo, Victorique mother. Saubrere is a country full of mystery and many legends and, from these legends, Kujo is known as the Grim Reaper and Victorique like fairy gold.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I saw:\\n\\n\r\nWell, GOSICK was no remnants of doubt, the best anime of the season in January (did not have many competitors also right ...). His animation is decent studio Bones and direction also does its job very well. From a technical standpoint GOSICK is a very good anime and the plot manages to overcome most of the classics. The episodes can be developed so fantastic, always leaving the viewer with a mad desire to watch the next episode. The character Victorique is catchy and is probably the most moe character of the year, while Kujo is one of the most interesting male characters I've ever seen.\\n\r\nThe ending is a bit heavy, but still is pretty cool, especially from the explanations shown on the main characters and the reunion of Victorique Kujo and that surely drew tears from many people who attended. The struggle between Cordell and Alberto de Blois is also a strong point and the end is interesting to see how the stories intersect and the characters remain alive and important progress. To end the accolades have to exalt the soundtrack of the anime, which has an opening song that starts very well the two episodes and closures that are historical. The 1st closing music is incredible and when I learned of the change was very sad, but the second song get over the first and has the advantage of having a better video.\\n\r\nThe only criticism to be made is, perhaps, the slow development of the story and stopped, but it is immutable in the quality of work.\\n\\n\r\nStrengths:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast, the soundtrack, development, costume and animation. It's perfect!\\n\\n\r\nWeaknesses:\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the story is kind of parade. Do not watch expecting not a lot of emotions.\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: 92/100 (a potential classic)\\n\r\nIMPORT: It would be a dream. It is difficult, but if you succeed in the U.S. is likely to.\\n\r\nSEASON 2: No, the story is over. At most one OVA.\\n\r\nLIKE: I had chance to look like Death Note. But made his own way and now will be inspiration for other anime.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal text in potuguese:\\n\\n\r\nhttp://animeluchos.blogspot.com/2011/07/gosick-analise.html",

            "content": "Problems and conflict are things that appear naturally throughout life. It might be annoying but one day you encounter one of these so called problems. You decide to solve it and eventually come up with an answer that you think is right and with this the problem is solved! If you think this is true than after watching Gosick you'll finally understand the reason why there is more than one answer to every question. GoSick is an anime that will take you on a series of twists in turns turning what you thought was right inside out and showing a the viewer another solution tothe problem.\\n\\n\r\nPlot 10/10\\n\r\nAt first glace GoSick might appear as your average murder mystery with our heroine, Victorique solving many of the mysteries using her amazing/unorthodox deductive skills with bits of comedy thrown in here and there. We'll if you thought this your wrong. As the story progresses suspense is thrown as you begin to see a larger conflict forming and within it the viewer starts to see how fates of all the characters intertwine and how everyone is connected to a bigger picture. One with everything that you thought was right turning out to be a wrong while at the same time leaving you with more and more questions. Finally when you reach the end where you don't know what to believe anymore all your questions are answered and everything is wrapped on beautifully with not a single scene being wasted throughout the series. During the last 20 seconds of episode 23 all I could do was stare at my screen and say amazing...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nThe plot is driven significantly with the help of the characters through the use of myths,fairy tails and other methods of story telling. For example when Kujo arrives at the school he becomes isolated from the rest of his classmates due to his black hair and dark eyes and gains the nickname, \"The Dark Reaper\" which is based on a ghost story. Victorique is also often described as a \"fairy\"\" which comes from another story. And through this all the stories eventually come together the reveal many hidden secrets\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are fun and easy to get used to in the beggining. You have your loli gothic detective Victorique who solves mysteries while at the same time bullying our protagonist and \"Dark Reaper\" Kujo. Throw in a police officer brother who takes advantage of his sister, a quirky teacher and busy body friend and you got yourself the making of an average anime but as their backgrounds are revealed and the mood begins to darken more characters are introduce and things arent what they seem too be.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP was the first thing to attract me to this Anime. It was catchy, fast-paced and something watch completely each week and shake my head to while singing along and I'm the type of person who usually skips the OP and goes straight to the actual show. Also throughout the entire series, the right music was played at key times to accompany the mood at that current time almost like magic, making it even more enjoyable. The EPs on the other hand where disappointing\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nWhen you think art in GoSick the first thing that will pop into your head will be the backgrounds. All of them were well detailed and added to the enjoyment factor of the show. In some parts the effort put into the backgrounds made some scenes feel more realistic/believable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nGoSick is one of my all time favorite animes manly because the ending of the 2nd to last episode is probably something I'll never forget for a long time. Although people who love mystery would enjoy this alot, GoSick has many other elements that'll appeal to the viewer like the progression of Kujo and Victorique's relationship throughout the story and much more. I recommend it to anyone who has free time and needs something to watch.",

In this anime, there is a bunch of stories, for example Doubt, if you ever read the manga there is a story about that in the anime. All the mystery's is planned really well and it really surprises me. \r\nSound 7 - I actually like the soundtrack they have added in, opening,ending and the OST. Voice character wise, excellent. It fits in the character nicely. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8 - I love loli's what's more with the Gothic looking outfit. Awesome expression and cuteness on her. Not only her but the other character as well. The teacher who is very clumsy and the other side female character who like the guy. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7 - I am a fan of romance, harem anime. It's time for me to try other anime I said, so I randomly pick an anime in the recommendations and this came out. I did not regret choosing this. The artwork is based on year 191+, it's a different feel, it's actually amazing to see nice artwork from this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9 - I actually look down on this anime at first without knowing what is this about and I take back my words. This anime is really planned well, the story is excellent, especially the first few episodes that really makes me want to watch more. First episode might be slow, but well I tried and I enjoyed it.",

            "content": "Gosick is a good show if you're looking for something to watch but don't have something specific in mind. It's a bit of mystery, a bit of romance, all wrapped around a plot that (while sometimes confusing) is enjoyable. The setting is in a fictitious  European country in the 1920's, but the writing style that comes across in the episodes has a very modern feel; it wasn't like reading Shakespeare.\r\nGosick at its core feels like it wants to be a love story. A love story set amongst the crazy events of a crazy world. But while intriguing, I never felt like I just hadto keep watching; like I couldn't stop and had to see what was going to happen next (either with the plot or with the characters). I felt like the character/relationship development between the 2 main characters stalled out at some point and wasn't explored. That's not to say that the romance aspect was bad, it was....okay. But I wanted to see more: I wanted to see how they dealt with pain, with hardship within their relationship. I wanted somebody to have to say how they felt. Gosick deals a lot with what isn't said. The love between the characters is more implied....and felt. It was cute, and enjoyable. But for me it wasn't real enough to really be great.\\n\\n\r\nGosick was fun, but it wasn't amazing. But it was easy to watch and it felt like it fit like a glove. The art/sound/music were all great and it had probably my favorite opening/ending sequences at the end of each episode for any anime I've watched. It's a good anime to just take it slow and enjoy.",

There is a lot going on in this world and every episode adds information needed to understand the final outcome at the end of the series.\r\nProbably because there was so much big picture material to cover, the character development was a little thin overall (with the exceptionof Victorique), and I took a point off for that.  Also, so much happens in the last two episodes the story feels rushed at the end, and very little time remained for the final scene, which was too bad because it was so important.   I really liked it and I believe most people would also.",

            "content": "Well to put it simply,this is a very brilliant anime.Especially if you're a loli lover and\r\nlove to watch anime with a mistery genre.The story is about victorique,a smart kid with a tsundere typical of attitude,who struggling with a lot of crime and mistery case and alongside victorique there's always kujo that always become her informant about almost all of the mystery in the story.The story begin when Kazuya Kujo,a transfer student from Japan entering his first year at Saint Marguerite Academy in Sauville which has many creepy story and mistery within it. When he goes to the top of the library,he meet with Victorique whichhas an appearance like a bisque doll.The beginning of the journey and fate of both of them are start after that.\\n\\n\r\nWell,I'll start to reviewing this anime.So here we go.\\n\\n\r\nAudio:the theme song and the sound in this anime is pretty much okay and nice.\\n\r\nStory:gosick have a very amazing plot.It's mainly center about the history and mistery about Sauville and the past of Victorique.It really make me addicted to this anime and can't stop watching it before the case is solved by the cute Victorique.It is really a typical of anime that will make you sit on the edge of your chair while you watch it and will satisfy you with a twisted and unpredictable ending.Beside mistery,there's a pretty large portion of romance too between Victorique and Kujo.\\n\r\nCharacter:Victorique and Kujo is the two protagonist and main character in this anime.Victorique is a very smart kid with a sharp mind which she call a wellspring of wisdom.She never came to the class and always at the top of the library to read a lot of book simultaneously.Kujo is a very kind guy that always watch over Victorique and often bring a lot of sweets which Victorique love it so much.Later their unique relationship slowly develop into a romantic and that make me really touched.There's also Avril who love Kujo but it seems to be one sided love. And the most annoying character is Grevil.He's the type of 'Parasitic' people who only use Victorique's smart brain for his own glory.But later in the story,he will become a nicer guy.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's my review for this anime.And this anime is definitely worth for you to watch cause i think this anime is one of the best anime in 2011.",

            "content": "I picked up this anime after a recommendation/review so, first and foremost, credentials, thanks to GRArkada, or glass reflection reviews on youtube, for Gosick. In the words of our man above, let's jam:-\r\nStory:- First off, and this clicked around halfway through watching the show, note the date. 1920s pseudo-realistic (which I'll explain in a min) Europe. In fact, 1924, 6 years after WW1. What an interesting period to base an anime in. Anyway, much of the plot revolves around a young girl (well, as the last anime of the episode says, a girl with beautiful golden hair who is 16 but looks 10) called Victorique,or, as everyone else calls her, Victorikaaahhhhh! Yeaaahh, gets annoying after a while. Anyway, her \"fountain of wisdom\" is used to solve the typical \"mystery of the week\", some which are kind of \"cop-outs\", as they couldn't be solved WITHOUT the fountain, others are so simple a real 10 year-old could solve it. Anyway, in brief, the stories change every week with a new \"mystery\", and a \"second story\", not a story as such, is the devlopment between Victorique (kaaaaaa... etc) and Kujo, our other main protagonist. It's not bad, nothing special. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:- The art is really nice, drawing on european designs of the 1920s, or gothic Victorian-style, shown in everything from Victorique (kaaaaa... OK, I'll stop) clothing to the academy where much of the story is based. Oh, better expain now why I said pseudo-realistic Europe. All of the story except a couple of middle episodes and the end (arguably the first episode for people who have watched the anime) is based in the fictional country Sauville, based in real-life Europe, on real-life Earth. One example of it being real-life Earth is because Japan as well as of course Europe in general is featured. The animation is also clean and crisp. A solid 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound is nothing special. There's nothing really of note, few escalating sounds in tense moments, but even the opening is nothing note-worthy. 5/10 (for at least being existant).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:- Victorique has all ready really been done in detail. The other main protagonist is Kujo, a Japanese transfer stude... NO. Really?! Another Japanese transfer student story! *sigh* suppose this is a little more developed. He's really annoying and just a useless sop, only use being Victoriques servant. While this never stops (for reasons the last 5 mins of the show, um... shows), at least the second half he grows more as his bond with Victorique grows. I liked him then! These others are just of note. First, I can't remember her name, but Victorique affectiony refers to her as something like \"Newt Fart\". Seriously. She's basically just another love interest for Kujo, though it it is pretty one-sided on her part. Next is the good Inspector. I mean, this is a mystery-drama, a law-enforcement officer was going to crop up somewhere. Yeah, he just helps solve the mysteries, and has a relationship with Victorique whch I won't spoil. Another man with a relationship with Victorique is the Marquis. A Marquis is basically a nobleman, above the rank of Earl within the noble system. This means he has a lot of power, pretty much being His Maj's right-hand man. Both the Marquis and the King have very little to do in the first half of the story, they are known just have little screen time, and there power is really shown in the second half. Lastly, Victoriques mum. She has a name just can't remember haha... She helps flesh out the backstory and even out the male/female character ratio I guess. 8.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thought: I realise this is a long review so I'll keep it short. This anime ends in a lovely fairy-tale ending and re-inforces the whole show. Unfortunately, it does have its problems, this is the kind of show you can watch while talking to friends on facebook, or playing on your 3DS/PSP/iPhone etc. What I mean is, even with it not having a dub, the story doesn't demand your full attention, but it's also enjoyable enough when you don't want to do anything but watch a show. I hope this is a good indicator of my thoughts on the show. With that, Gosick recieves a very good 7/10, or 70%, or 70/100, or... etc etc.",

            "content": "It's one of those shows where my opinion on them and my thoughts on what it is about in the beginning and in the end are completely different. And yet, in a sense, are both correct.\r\nIt starts out as nothing that unusual: the two main characters are a usual boy and a girl who is super smart but socially awkward. They start solving mysteries together and their relationship progresses. \"Oh, it's another one of those. So, they'll continue being friends, there probably will be a pseudo-love triangle and in the end they'll admit their affections. Hope the detective subplots are interesting, at the very least\".These were my thoughts. Not entirely wrong, since show seemingly is arc-based and there even is a kinda-sorta-love triangle. Much to my surprise and joy, it turned out there's much more to this anime. Resolved mysteries come into play later (not all of them but most surprisingly do, one way or another), the characters evolve throughout the series, which applies not only to the main leads but also to a good chunk of the supporting cast. The relationship between the two is focused on but there is a surprising lack of padding. What I liked is they didn't really discuss it or explore it; they knew it was real and acted on it, which made it feel very believable and unique.\\n\\n\r\nWhich, again, surprised me, since the two leads aren't all that original. Victorique, say, looks exactly like Shinku from Rozen Maiden, save for her hair being a different type of blonde and the eye color, and even has a similar know-all attitude but, of course, actually cares for Ju- I mean Kazuya. He, on the other hand, is your typical kind and nice guy willing to sacrifice himself for others and so on. Most of their interactions involve her treating him badly on the surface while secretly caring for him, which is obvious to the audience and himself, really. He doesn't get it immediately (again, kudos to the writers for showing character progression) but pretty soon he stops complaining and just goes along with it, so this attitude, instead of resulting in a tedious and unfunny comedy routine, serves as a means to express Victorique's feelings indirectly, making the dialogues interesting to listen to. This is the soul of the anime, it builds up the bond between the leads while keeping things engaging, and I won't go into spoilers but boy, does it pay off!\\n\\n\r\nNone of the other characters are as developed, though most feel complete with just enough attention paid to them. I wish there was more of Brian Roscoe (I think the writers really like Christopher Nolan's movies; you'll get it when you see the twist with him) and less of Avril, who ended up being mostly pointless and rather cliched with her stereotypic girly personality. She's not prominent enough to become annoying, thankfully. The main villain, despite having no clear redeeming qualities, is good in that he has a realistic and a terrifyingly noble goal, making him, in the end, very believable and real. That goes for everyone in this anime, the baddies included - none are all that implausible and most of them are even identifiable. Again, not everyone, but most do have a legitimate reason behind their crime, be it passion, grief, friendship or fear. \\n\\n\r\nThe crimes themselves are what I was concerned about at first. A detective seems to be the easiest genre to write; well, it's also the easiest to screw up. The answer can be too obvious, too complicated, too implausible or just plain impossible to guess. Not the case here. All the solutions are comprehensible and well-explained, none rely on mystical forces, in fact, the point that there's no such thing, instead, the science is what moves the world is made more than once. The creators make a point of showing all the details required to solve the mystery, so Victorique doesn't come out as a genius who spots things others don't: we know just as much as she. For me, it is an essential part of a good detective. So, even though they aren't what the show, in the end, is about, the subplots are entertaining to watch thanks to the intrigue.\\n\\n\r\nGosick has a rather unique atmosphere to it, most of it coming from the setting. The story takes place in a fictional country between France and Italy in 1924, which means shortly after the end of the first World War, which is acknowledged and referenced. This fact is interesting in itself, you don't see that much media attention being paid to the FIRST World War now. I also liked the architecture and the fashions which aren't modern yet but also don't feel entirely archaic. Speaking of the first World War, politics plays an increasingly important role in the show, so much so that the final episodes don't even have any mystery stories to them. Instead, they take a rather grim turn to show the second World War (in 1925; yeah, this part I still don't get), though mostly from the perspective of the main characters. Historic events are intertwined with their fate, which serves both as a story catalyst and a means to develop them. Overall, what starts out as a bright tale about a detective girl turns into a rather dark story deeply connected with the setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and the voice acting are consistently good, nothing to be said here. I especially liked the actress portraying Victorique, she did a great job keeping her appealing despite her rough attitude.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, it was a surprising and fantastic experience. A seemingly arc-based generic romantic comedy turned out to have a great plotline and discuss both World Wars, ultimately resulting in a satisfying experience complete with two great leads with believable chemistry. I can't find anything that's wrong with this anime.",

            "content": "Gosick is definitely a hooker from the first moment I watched it due to the twisted facial expressions that accompanies horror films. However, this turned out to be a pleasantly sweet mystery/romantic comedy, but that aspect, in my opinion, enhances the show and makes it more enjoyable. \r\n     The story is set in a fictional country, but drops hints of very realistic events such as war, oppression, class differences, racism, political greed, and more. Given that this is a mirror of some European country, the finer grains of sand from the aforementioned themes down to thecostumes(Victorique's dress!) speaks of Europe's very culture. I could believe there really is a country called Sauville in Europe if the author hadn't stated it didn't exist.\\n\\n\r\n     The plot is the striking point, and this is where Gosick's charm comes in. The story makes use of creative schemes and tricks that haven't been used in a cliche manner in its plot, and although the ending of these plots are sometimes fairly predictable, the road to reach the ending is tortuous and presents a fun watch. The show does have some horror aspects such as twisted facial expressions and many deaths, especially in the first 3 episodes, but there is much less gore compared to some other shows. What I love most about the plot, however, is that every short story/plot lends to the major, overarching plot. The author integrated \"history\"  with unique and relatable antagonists and situations to create pieces of a puzzle that complete pieces of another puzzle that completes another puzzle. Kinda like those Russian nesting dolls that fit inside one another. \\n\\n\r\n     The characters are the next intriguing points. But at this point, you might be wondering why I gave it a 9 when all I spewed are compliments, so I'll say that I think the problem lies here. With such a realistic background and very believable events, the  characters make the story seem just a little fabricated, and Victorique is the main reason why. Don't get me wrong, Victorique is one of my all-time favorite characters out of all the anime I've ever watched(the way she pouts is so adorable) and I love the way they made her consistent(I've watched anime where the main lead is smart in one aspect and suddenly dumb in another) but the problem is that she's too smart. She figures out the correct solution to a problem when, in reality, there could be many possible resolutions, and personally, I find that a little hard to believe. It's like clicking C out of 4 answer choices and getting the question right when in reality there could be many right answers if you were asked to write a free response. She is also the solution to every problem: her Sherlock Homes out-of-world smarts is partially what drives the plot forward. I don't have a problem with that, but when the solution is almost formulaic...well. However, her personality is a solid all-time favorite and what I love most is her unique monotone way of speaking and her somewhat tilted way of humor. I didn't have a problem with Kujo's character; he's basically a remedy to Victorique's loneliness and he's silly and fun. They both had fantastic backstories, especially Victorique and Victorique's mother, and the other characters are well developed and add a dimension of depth to human nature. \\n\\n\r\n     Overall, this anime kept me wishing for more. Each mini plot was drastically different from its predecessors, which kept the anime from being repetitive, and all those plots nicely built up to an exciting and beautiful finale. The art and music complemented the tone as well. This show does have its flaws but it is very close to a perfect score. Through looking through the lens of this anime I can pick up an idea of what Europe might have been like in its older days and still enjoy everyday lives of students in an academy.",

            "content": "GOSICK is a detective / romance / mystery comedy anime.\r\nThe detective part is fun, the romance is very strong, the mystery was far fetched and weak and the comedy at times very funny.\r\nThe story follows Kojo a third son of an Imperial Soldier who attends St Magarittes Academy, a school for Europes wealthy elite in the fictional country of Sauville. Unfortunately he makes no friends because of his dark hair and eyes he is thought to be the \"Black Reaper of Spring\" from a local ghost story and will bring misfortune to everyone. Running an errand for his teacher to the school library he meetsVeronique (aka the Golden fairy / Grey wolf) an highly intelligent and perceptive but rude, stubborn and proud 16 year old girl with an overfondness of sweets who has a lolita appearance and seems to spend her time reading in the library as she is forbidden from leaving the school grounds by her aristocratic father. Together they solve mysteries and embark on a first strong friendship then romance where world events seem to be determine to tear them apart.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half, which is extremely fun, is about Kojo and Veronique getting to know each other and solving mysteries together. Despite her flaws Veronique becomes to depend on Kojo who despite Veronique's rudeness indulges her every whim, shows himself to be very resourceful and promises to find Veronique wherever she is, a promise he keeps. The second half is about the mystery of Veronique's birth, political corruption and war and the story has more plot holes than swiss cheese.\\n\\n\r\nKojo and Veroniques characters are very strong and without them the series would fall apart. Most of the comedy comes from Veronique when she is victim of her own pride and has brilliant expressions when she is angry. Watch out for her sarcastic laugh and when she gets stuck in a tree during a thunderstorm because she was too pround to admit she couldn't get down. This turns into a sweet moment when she tries and fails to impress Kojo by making a cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other character of note is the half brother of Veronique, Gravil who is Sauville's greatest detective because Veronique solves all his cases for him and he takes all the credit. At first they appear that they don't like each other but later you find that this isn't true and Gravil tries to protect Veronique from the worst excesses of their father.\\n\\n\r\nThe two biggest problems are the plot surrounding Veronique's birth and secondary characters. A lot really isn't explained why she is so important to the Ministry of the Occult and her father's ambitions. Also the secondary characters are weak. Ok there is the teach and house mother, fine all good but Avril brings nothing to the series, Veronique's mother Cordelia was wasted and the mysterious Brian Roscoe remained mysterious and we didn't learn why he was in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately there was always the anchor of Kojo and Veronique to steady the  ship and the ending was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a very good anime and Kojo and Veronique cancel out any weaknesses the show has although it could have been even better.",

            "content": "This is my first review so go easy on me \r\nI watched Gosick after my room mate recommended it to me and i found it thoroughly enjoyable so much in fact that i watched it all over two days\r\nStory 10\r\nI loved the story the progressions is not fast but not lacking either it moves along at its own pace but the pace suits the series. The way in which the main characters solve the crimes are solved is reminiscence of Sherlock Holmes where every event no mater how supernatural has a plausible explanation behind it. The series progresses through a series of crimes all ofwhich either link to later crimes or explain the relationship between the main characters and each is solved with the collection of seemingly unimportant facts or 'Fragments of Chaos' as Victorique would refer to them. While the crimes themselves are the prominent part of the series they are all solved relatively easily by Victorique and a large chunk of each early episodes are devoted to character development whereas the later episodes concentrate on the various interlinking mysteries that come together culminating into a very well written ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nthe art was very good showing the characters in good detail and the landscape was excellent showing the various seasons and weather in superb detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6\\n\r\nThe sound on the whole was good with the intro and the first outro suiting the anime very well however the only drawback i found with this anime was the second outro which seemed to ruin the emotional build up that several episodes had so beautifully created. whoever that said the rest of the sound and music fit the anime well\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\r\nI loved the characters of this series each had its own roll and they executed it perfectly. You loved the hero's and Hated the villains all the voices matched the characters perfectly (though i did get tired of Kujou always screaming Victorique) and each character had it own contributions to each case. The Main characters of Victorique and Kujou reminded be initially of Holmes and Watson with Victorique being Holmes and Kujou being Watson. Victorique's attention to detail and ability to reason was incredible and because of that she was able to solve every challenge set before her, but no without the help of her side kick Kujou to whom her constantly belittles but always cares for. Watching the two fall in love and just how deep their trust for each other went was inspiring towards the end of the series certain events nearly led me in tears , as they struggled with their respective problems. On the whole these may be my favorite character of all time. Even the villain in this story was superb it makes you actually hate him which is hard to do in any story villains are often disliked in anime but rarely hated to the extent i found myself hating this one\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nIf you couldn't tell from above i thoroughly loved this anime. Loved it Loved it Loved it Loved it Loved it Loved it Loved it Loved it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10\\n\r\nLoved it what more can i say this is now almost my favorite anime and i would recoment it to almost any anime fan (with the exception of kids as some of the series is a tad gory)",

But overall this anime was great if your interested into historical things and a bit of crime work then this is a really great anime. Thx!!",

            "content": "I'd say of all the anime I've seen in the past year and a half, this is the one that's tripped me up the most as to how much I love this anime. Part of me would say its a great anime, one of the best I've ever seen, while another part completely hates this anime. In my opinion, this anime pulled a Mass Effect 3 (I bet this is going to become a popular reference point). This anime was fantastic...for 22 episodes. The last two episodes, in my opinion, were extremely disappointing. Perhaps I should explain what my positives and negatives of this animereally were.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I loved most about Gosick was the heartfelt, emotional character building that took place between the characters, primarily Kujo and Victorique. This anime did such a great job building the emotional bond between these two that it was beautiful...for 22 episodes. Although, it wasn't just them. Even seeing the interactions between Victorique and Grevil as well as Cordelia and Brian. Each interaction seemed well written, well acted, and built a tone that was well set throughout the anime. Even Avril Bradley, a character I couldn't stand, had her moments where I could tolerate her. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I loved about this anime was the plot. It was really interesting. I've always been one that is interested in doing foreign exchange and on top of that, I'm sort of a history nerd. Combining the two made even more interesting with Kujo studying in 1920s Europe. Oh, and did I mention I'm a Sherlock Holmes fan? This plot was up my alley from day 1. However, going beyond that, I loved how the plot thickened (see what I did there?) when we learned more about Cordelia Gallo, Brian Roscoe, and both Albert and Grevil de Blois. How they were all connected to Victorique was amazing and (up through episode 22), I was enthralled with this story. There was only one major flaw with this anime and boy was it a major flaw...\\n\\n\r\nThe last two episodes. Oh man, were these a bummer. I know I'm supposed to refrain from spoilers, but I'll make you an offer. Through this next paragraph, I'll reveal some spoilers. Whether you've seen the anime or not, I'll leave to your discretion to read them. After this paragraph, I'll stop with the spoilers. I'm only pointing them out because they are the major flaws with the anime. Okay, here they are...\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS*...In episode 23, after Victorique gets taken away by Grevil, Kujo goes back to Japan and joins the Japanese military...and they are at war. Now, I know this anime does flirt with European history (considering they even made up a fake country as a setting), but I wish they would've revealed what war Kujo was fighting in. The Japanese military was not very active during the mid-1920s. In fact, no military was really that active. World War I decimated Europe in the 1910s and there really wasn't a whole lot of conflict up until WWII (which wasn't until the mid-1930s). So I am VERY puzzled as to why Kujo was at war. Now, I will admit, this anime \"hinted\" at the coming Great War via Victorique's readings through the Fragments of Chaos. HOWEVER, they didn't really show that much happening between Saubure and all the other countries. To be honest, the whole topic of war in this story felt very forced. If this anime's setting was the 1930s, I'd be okay with it. HOWEVER, it wasn't. Plain and simple. Then, you have the final...battle?...between Cordelia and Albert. Someone who has seen this anime please tell me what the hell was this? Am I suppose to believe that an aristocrat and a 90 lb long haired, full dressed (literally, she's wearing a dress) can get into a full fledged ninja/samurai-esque fight? I think I might've actually chuckled at this scene even though it was supposed to be tense and dramatic. This felt WAY too unrealistic. The end result of the scene was actually very good, I won't argue against that...but the whole fight scene just felt really unnecessary. It really felt like the creators were going with the \"hey, we need padding and we need entertainment...let's add a ninja fight!\" Completely unnecessary and didn't fit the tone of this anime at all. FINALLY, and my biggest beef of all...THE FINAL EPISODE! This whole thing! It was...bad...well, not completely bad, but it certainly wasn't good. We practically learned the fate of all the characters in this anime throughout the whole episode...and Kujo and Victorique got practically the last 2 minutes. Really? The two main characters of this anime and you're giving them a whole 2 minutes for their reunion? Really?! Oh, but it gets better! Kujo comes back from years at war, Victorique goes through hell and back to get to Japan, so what happens when they see each other at the port? Meh, not much. They act like they just saw each other a few weeks ago. They built up all this dramatic suspense of the two being separated...and that's how they reunite them? By a hello and let's walk together underneath a cherry tree? Seriously, color me disappointed. To be honest, I didn't think the last two episodes were THAT bad...but it felt like the creators got so caught up in themselves with the final episode it was as though they looked at the clock and said, \"oh crap, we only have 2 minutes left and we need to somehow squeeze in Kujo and Victorique's reunion!\" It felt very rushed and I shake my head at the creators for the abysmal failure that was the final episode. *END SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\n*phew* Again, sorry for revealing so many spoilers in that last paragraph, but I did forewarn you if you didn't see the anime that I would be revealing some spoilers from the last 2 episodes. Overall, this anime was a fun experience. The dramatic suspense that this anime built over 24 episodes was really well done. However, there were moments during the final 2 episodes where I shook my head and couldn't believe the producers were going this route. While this anime was on the brink of being my favorite anime of all-time, the very ending of this anime felt like Mass Effect 3. It left a sour taste in my mouth and while the ending doesn't completely detract from the overall anime, it does sort of kill the buzz.",

            "content": "Gosick review \r\nVictorique is adorabaleand follows Kujo and Victorique as they either dive headfirst into the various ghost stories or legends that frequent their school and try to unravel the mysteries surrounding each . The main focus in this show is not on solving the mysteries but on the character interaction between Kujo and Victorique and how this interaction helps them solve those mysteries and get over the trouble they get in each time.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace of the show is slow  in the beginning we are introduced to the 1924 classic atmosphere , the picturesque peisage  of a mountain village, the old houses and buildings  architecture, the old steam train  and the people living in that village. The characters design and clothes are nostalgic and fit perfectly in the 20th century background peisage which the story is set in.As for small details Gosick excels at making them useful for the story and aesthetics  and captivates the minds and eyes of the viewer.  Another important fact is the development of the story and characters  it\u2019s not set in a static place, we are always on \u201ca moving  train\u201d and the\u201d stations\u201d where the train makes a stop is our setting where our characters Kujo and Victorique solves the mysteries.The transition between those places is also done natural and according to the progression of the story and characters actions and influence.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance between those two is not rushed at all and it\u2019s done according to the natural flow of the story. At first those two act like friends teasing each other , as the story progresses  we find more about our characters and their bond becomes more stronger. As each of them find about their story and circumstances  they began to develop feelings for each other  and became practically inseparable like two identical halfs  forming a whole.What\u2019s impressive is the fact how those two work as a team to solve mysteries , Kujo with the labor work and Victorique with the brain, everything done  in a perfect synchro.The main concept this anime  abords is about human nature to be more precise the bond and trust between two strangers as in our case Victorique and Kujo. \\n\\n\r\nGosick has some flaws that the viewer may notice along the development of the story for example some minor characters are casted away , victorique acting as a spoiled child in some situations, but that doesn\u2019t  make Gosick a terrible show as a contradiction  it adds a tone of comedy to the show. Also the interactions and teasing between Kujo and Victorique is enjoyable to watch and the viewer can relate to real life situations.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Gosick are not that flashy and well developed but that doesn\u2019t affect the story at all because Gosick focuses on the interactions between those characters and the influence they have on each other directly or indirectly.In one word the connection between characters and interactions  with each other make the story in Gosick.\\n\\n\r\nKujo  is the main character and a transfer student from Japan , he is known as \u201cThe black reaper who brings the spring\u201d one of the folk stories from Saubure . He came to Saint Marguerite Academy  as a excuse to run from his problems back at home. His meeting with Victorique will change his life and decisions that he will make for his future. This influence helps in his character development and in accepting his past which is a tumultuous one.With this the show clearly puts in a spotlight the meaning behind \u201cWhen you have someone dear to you to protect humans become stronger\u201d which in this case Kujo from a crybaby becomes a man who everybody can rely on him.\\n\\n\r\nVictorique  is our heroine , who solves mysteries with the help her friend Kujo. Most of the time she  likes to act  as a spoiled  little child who needs attention , and tbh the repetitive use of this attitude kinda annoyed me.  Her character development is also influenced by Kujo and the interactions between them across the flow of the story. She is arrogant and has a typical tsundere reaction evidentiated by her reaction around Kujo , she hits him when she is in a bad mood. Also she has a soft part too and cares about the bond between her and Kujo and she is always happy when Kujo visits her and brings her sweets  in exchange for solving the mysteries. \\n\\n\r\nOther minor characters help with the development of the main characters Kujo and Victorique but there are used as plot devices for the progression of the story and casted away after their job is done.\\n\r\nThe villain is the typical greedy one who thinks only for his own benefits and earnings and likes to sacrifice people to achieve his goal. He is the weakest piece in this puzzle called Gosick and even after his story and circumstances are presented the viewer can\u2019t agree with his actions and will only result in a flaw for the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters design and the stunning 20th century peisage captivates the mind  of the viewer from the first episode to the last.The small details crafted into the buildings and characters are well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound and opening song are good , the ost used fits perfect in the classic atmosphere of the 20th century.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  9/10\\n\r\nEven if some moments may seem annoying and the villain is a joke this show clearly is enjoyable especially the character interactions is fun to watch how they tease  each other. Also the ending is a good reward for those who love romance anime and you won\u2019t be disappointed at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 \\n\r\nThe mix of comedy and drama and the transition between those two is executed well by the characters interactions and influence on each other. It\u2019s a enjoyable classic romance story set in a nostalgic 20th century environment which  adds elements of comedy and mysterie to make it more appealing for the viewer. \\n",

What is the final war that they are fighting? \\n\r\n2. How did Kojo's letter got ended up in the hands of the Science Acedemy Head?\\n\r\n3. What does the scene of Kojo crawling across the desert without his legs meant?\\n\r\n4. How did Vitorique's hair turned white?\\n\\n\r\nI personally got really confused when the after episode 20 due to the lack of explanation that the show is giving, which is a complete opposite of what this anime had been doing, that is, explaining everything in the most detailed way possible.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way the answer to those questions are as follow:\\n\r\n1. There was no given explanation but it shouldn't be hard to have at least guess it's WWII\\n\r\n2. Also no given explanation\\n\r\n3. Also no given explanation\\n\r\n4. Also no given explanation\\n\\n\r\nIt is a huge let down for me that the show didn't even try to explain all those things after it has done so for literally the entire series and just leave it for viewers' speculation.\\n\\n\r\nWhat they could have done in my opinion, is instead of creating a \"fake\" WWII another historical event that happened around the time period which involves Japan, Britain, and France and many other countries while Japan also lost, is the Russian Civil War which happened from 1917 - 1923, where as the story of Gosick ends at 1929.\\n\\n\r\nSo... a 4 year of separation happened for Kujo and Victorique and they spent a full year together... \\n\r\nI am not sure if this is true but I don't believe Kujo can be enlisted as a soldier if the producer decides to move the time period of the show slightly earlier, which would can keep up an almost accurate historical background as well as having explain everything.\\n\\n\r\nThat is why I gave this anime an overall rating of 7 and possibly 6 if not because I am so subjective about it.\\n\r\nOverall a great anime but the way the story ends it can be done so much more flawlessly than it had and ends a 7 for this absolute great show.",

            "content": "Set in the fictional country of Sauville with French and Italian elements in the shows art and atmosphere talks of the journey of a young Japanese student running away from home in many ways. The protag himself isn't very interesting the most second most featured character the blonde cute little lolita takes up most of the center stage and by far is the best character in the anime.\r\nStory: For the first half or so didn't keep my interest much it wasn't till later I started to get really invested, first few episodes may have been stretched to far to introduce the characters and a lotof it was small separate events that didn't have much to do with the main story line but getting past the first half was worth the investment when shit started to hit the fan later on. There is historical contradictions but that is to be expected when you have a fictional kingdom that doesn't exist, like the dates of World War 2 came earlier.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The European setting is fantastic, much of the design for areas featured in the anime were well done and accurately blended in well with Europe but at times it felt a bit of a older age than the 1900s. More Victorian looking which is ironic but there was design and elements that made it seem like it was post World War I which is the time it's set in.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OST is pretty good, while at times I felt natural sound could have been used better in certain events through out the story. OST does well to fit in with the theme of the country and story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The show lacked well developed characters even the protag could have been made better he doesn't even seem like the main character half the time even though it's clear most of it centers around him, though the second most featured character in the show seems to be way more structured and interesting than everyone else. There were some other characters later on that were very interesting but they weren't used much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is worth a watch, much of it could have been made better and it didn't really need to be 25 episodes long because some episodes didn't seem necessary with the over all plot but the second half of Gosick is worth it when it starts to get a bit more serious.\\n",

            "content": "Gosick has something for everyone. Romance? Check. Drama? Check. Mystery? Check. Action? Check. Ecchi? \u2026 Well, I guess not. \r\nIt is 1924 and Kujo \"enrolls\" in a study abroad program to attend St. Marguerite Academy, which is located in the fictional European nation of Sauville. Nicknamed the \"Grim Reaper\" for his black hair and (conveniently) black school uniform, Kujo struggles to fit in amongst his classmates until he goes into the school library and meets a rather short girl named Victorique De Blois. Little did he know that he will soon become Victorique's manservant. Victorique doesn't go to class but she reads books all dayin a Hogwarts-esque library. So, she is constantly bored and she begins to nag Kujo to bring her interesting stories. With her self-proclaimed \"wellspring of wisdom\" and Kujo's adventurousness, the tag team begins to uncover convoluted mysteries in Sauville that some people have thought were unsolvable. \\n\\n\r\nSaying anything more would deprive you of the epic rollercoaster ride that is Gosick. This anime has many interesting twists and turns that keeps you on the edge of your seat. However, Victorique seems to have unraveled the mystery before it even begins. It doesn't seem like any of the mystery is a challenge to her and perhaps those of you who are searching for a slightly less over-powered main character may be disappointed. The anime does have many dark elements to it: grisly murders, ghosts, and overzealous cults. Thrilling as they may be but if you are someone who watches scary films with a pillow in front of your eyes (like me), avoid watching Gosick at night. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough Gosick is listed as a romance anime, the romantic aspects don't come through until the latter half. However, this allows for the writers to meticulously build up the relationship between the main characters and have it all release towards the end. This is one of the aspects that the script got it right. Many times, the romance seems to pop out of the blue or poorly expressed but Gosick takes a very logical approach to developing the romantic dynamics. While the romance cannot compare to drama/romance anime, it is nevertheless very satisfying to experience.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lively cast of characters in Gosick and there is not one character who seems to be out of place. As he proudly calls himself, Kujo is the third son of a Japanese Imperial soldier. He is pretty light-headed but when his partner Victorique can't think straight, he picks up the slack. For me, Kujo is an annoying character because he's like a fly in a room. He aimlessly wanders about and gets himself into trouble despite Victorique warning him. Thankfully, he's brave and stubborn because that gets him out of many situations. \\n\r\nVictorique is the female lead and she is a fascinating character to watch. She has the personality of a rock but when given candy, she can turn as cute as a puppy. Her character development can be neatly described as peeling an onion. Every episode of Gosick is peeling off one layer of Victorique's character until we get to the very end. Indeed, what's at the center of the onion is very delicious.\\n\r\nGrevil De Blois is an inspector who is very well-known in Sauville for solving seemingly unsolvable mysteries. Of course, we all know who his consultant is. He sports a narwhal hairstyle and is pretty much arrogant all of the time. But similar to Victorique's character development, we get to eventually see his true personality.\\n\r\nThere is also Avril, who is one of Kujo's classmates and is jealous that Kujo constantly spends time with Victorique. She is mainly there for comic relief but she does get involved in a mystery. \\n\r\nThere are many more characters but they are gradually introduced in the story. This is what makes Gosick very exciting: new characters constantly join the party.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was very good. The background music was similar to listening to symphonies: lots of strings and brass. The OP was solid and the first ED was very catchy. You probably would find yourself singing the first few lines whenever it starts to play. The voice acting was also very well done, especially Victorique's voice actor. The feelings that were heard through her voice in the last few episodes were amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was well-done as well. The background scenery were incredibly detailed and all the characters had their unique style. Bones did the animation and they also did Noragami, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and Soul Eater. Indeed, they can produce some solid art.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime kept me wanting to know what happens next until I was very disappointed to know that I had reached the final episode. If you are looking for a solid anime, give Gosick a try! Perhaps the only people who wouldn't like Gosick would be those who hate plot twists. Also, it would be very interesting to see what happens if the characters in Hyouka, especially Oreki, met Gosick's cast. Oh how many more mysteries will there be?!\\n\\n\r\nLet me know how you thought of Gosick! Did you have a favourite mystery? I would love to hear from you!",

I can tell you that in every single episode, they are solving a mystery and i find that really interesting. \r\nStory 10/10 \r\nI really like how the storyline flows and i liked the feeling where the culprit/murderer was caught. xD \r\nCharacter 10/10\r\nI'm a hardcore Victorique fan. I loved her tsundere personality, she's also adorable. \r\nSound 8/10\r\nThe sound may not be Very good but still good. \r\nEnjoyment 10/10\r\nThis enjoyment is when before the mystery's progressing, you're probably thinking about whose the culprit and how you might think the situation might turn out. But as forme, most of them turned out unexpected. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 \\n\r\nI loved the show, definitely worth watching! ^^",

            "content": "I absolutely love the mystery genre as a whole, and it was surprising to me when I found out that that is what Gosick is all about (I decided to watch this anime on a whim simply because I liked the cover art, so I knew literally nothing about it)\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nThe story starts off with little \"side tales\" and while they're mostly irrelevant to the main plot, they do a good job at developing the relationship between the two protagonists and at building the world. Halfway through the series, we move on to the 'main plot' and the little side tales are replaced bya much bigger mystery. I think the anime does a good job of displaying key elements necessary to solve the mysteries and it felt like none of the information was being withheld from the viewer (save for a few things towards the last episodes, but these are done for the sake of plot development). There are moments of suspense, thrill, action and comedy, and it gives you all of these in approximately equal and adequate doses, it never felt like the show was trying to force one specific feeling down my throat. While I can't say much without spoiling the story, when the great mystery is solved at the end, the anime does a superb job at weaving in all the little pieces which you hadn't even thought would be relevant, and it does so in a meticulous and well crafted way, everything fits together perfectly, and you can tell the story is extremely well written. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the Art, the animation is good but not outstanding, I really loved the backgrounds used and the art style. Unlike most traditional anime, Gosick does a good job at representing characters from different ethnicities and there aren't any characters which I found to have over-the-top designs.Furthermore, the different art used in the Opening Theme looks superb.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nSame thing with the sound, it does its job well, but there is nothing particularly memorable about it. The opening theme however is amazing and thankfully was kept the same for the whole 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\r\nThis is in my opinion where Gosick falls short. The main characters Victorique and Kujo are well rounded and their relationship is the foundation of the anime, they're both likable characters (despite Kujo's somewhat annoying habit of calling out \"Victorique!\" way too often) and their relationship is complex, there is sufficient character development throughout the show to demonstrate that the two have made an impact on each other. However that's where it stops, the other characters aren't terribly designed, but they're just not as developed as they could be. However, there is one particular character which I felt served absolutely no purpose in the story and honestly it felt like they were just there for the sake of it. Overall good character design, but it would've been nice to see a little more from someone other than the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nIf you like mystery, you will like this. It has many of the same elements a mystery novel has and as stated before, besides a couple of things during the last episodes, there isn't any information withheld from the viewer which would be required to solve a crime (in other words you are more than welcome to try and solve it yourself before Victorique does)\\n\\n\r\nOverall a great anime and I would definitely recommend it.\\n",

The story is indeed amazing as there are really no 'filler' episodes in this anime filled with complete BS that have nothing to do with building the actual plot. Each episode gives insight to character developments, relationships, romance, and story.\r\nThis series was simply great in almost every aspect, however, I did notice it lacked severely in one thing - Epic Moments. Scenes that would blow a viewer off their couch, make them scream and yell, or give them a laugh. It lacked everything in that which is why I could not give it morethan an 8/10. Epic moments in Sword Art Online, Death Note, Code Geass; scenes that would just make you say 'wow' was all lacking.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this to anyone simply looking to watch an anime series and is looking for a mixture of romance and mystery. 8/10",

            "content": "Every now and then a show, doesn't particularly have to be an anime, comes along that sweeps you off your feet and engrosses you in another world. The Last Air Bender, Le Chevalier d'Eon, Tetsuwan Birdy Decode, So Ra No Wo To, and now Gosick. I personally have always been a fan of movies and shows that take you from one place and drop you at another by then end of it. Especially if that place is time itself. Shows and movies that follow a character or a set of characters across several years are hard to find, but almost all of them are executedbrilliantly. A few examples would be Forrest Gump, Rin, and this anime falls among them.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit I did not expect this story to go where it went or to reach as far as it did. You start the series feeling one way and by the time it's over you have a completely different feeling in the pit of your stomach that won't go away. The story centers around Victorique and Kujo; two characters who are bound to one another by a very strong bond that is near unbreakable even with the interference of some side characters. The two spend the majority of their time solving individual mysteries that at first seem unconnected or random, and can lead you to believe that the entire series will resemble this. In fact I half expected them to solve small mysteries up until the final 6 or 7 episodes and then suddenly there's this larger plot that they have to take on. I also expected it to have a cliche, cookie cutter, happy ending with a long speech given by Kujo about his morals and ideals. Fortunately this is not the case. The overarching story is ever present even though you might not notice at first. But slowly as they solve more mysteries the pieces are put together. Everything in the series happens for a reason and the reasons are generally quite profound. When all is said and done you will think that you started watching Gosick, but somehow ended up watching grave of the fireflies. The last remaining piece of the story that really drove me to keep watching was it's constant tie to history. Not just putting the characters in some fantasy universe created solely for this show, but tying them to the real world as well. Similar techniques can be seen in the aforementioned examples (Forrest Gump, Rin).\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe landscapes were breathtaking in almost every scene. The characters fit into each panel so well you would think they were painted in. Everything was fluidly animated and didn't stretch the boundaries of the imagination. There wasn't much action, but when it did arise it was very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nA great soundtrack that moves you at every turn and does a fantastic job of driving the story and the minimal action and suspense forward.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThough I pretty much already summed this up I'll give a quick overview and fill in some points I hadn't mentioned before. The characters were very well developed and seemed to have deeper connections to this fabricated world than merely existing there. Each character had some small story to tell. Whether it be Sophie and the slightly dim-witted teacher who had been friends for 10 years or Avril who wanted to become an adventurer like her grandfather and who was also in love with Kujo. All of the characters recieved attention even if they only appeared for an episode or two.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nEvery person will enjoy this to a different degree, but I can wholeheartedly say that every person will enjoy this series. It's almost impossible not to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nA great series that will leave you begging for more by the end. I love the style, the era, the characters, the art; Everything drives me to wonder if there will be a second season. Though another season would be nonsensical.",

            "content": "There are few stories I can immerse myself in. There are even fewer that cause me to delay and delay finishing solely because I don\u2019t want the story to end. Sometimes it\u2019s because I can relate, other times it\u2019s because I like the dialogue, prose, characters. Others ooze a certain vibe or atmosphere that hits me in just the right spot. Gosick, with its combination of gorgeous artwork, endearing main characters and a delightfully victorian gothic (but in the 1920s) type storyline, was one of those series that managed to crawl its way into my heart from the beginning.\r\nThe anime\u2019s first half is fairly episodic,establishing the relationship between Kujo, the \u201cBlack Reaper\u201d from Japan, and Victorique, the \u201cGolden Fairy\u201d who resides at the top of a tower-like library. Victorique is a master of mystery, able to solve any case thrown her way by the somewhat eccentric Inspector de Blois, and Kujo, having become Victorique\u2019s unofficial helper, goes along for the ride. The cases sometimes span one episode, and sometimes two-three in mini-plot arcs drenched in Sherlockian intrigue. That is, until the cases delve into a more personal flavor, sprouting questions regarding Victorique\u2019s origin, present and intended future.\\n\\n\r\nGosick\u2019s atmosphere holds up the fun, delicately whimsical characters against a progressively more gothic story that is positively charming in a darker sense of the word. The artwork in the opening credits help to establish a fairy tale quality to the atmosphere, with the musical score lending power to the story\u2019s mood. The comedy is [mostly] well-timed, allowing the viewer to breathe between darker moments and not feel crushed under some overly heavy-handed drama.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, almost every series has its drawbacks. Some of the fight scenes near the end felt cheap and far too, well, anime to be a part of the setting that had been so well established. There were some overly silly moments that felt unnecessary and frustratingly mood-shattering. Fortunately, the silly comedic moments were pretty few and far between, and the craziness of the ending fight scenes did not subtract from the wonderfully climactic build of the final episodes to a charming and heart-warming ending to tie it all off with.\\n\\n\r\nFor those searching for something a little different dipped in a dark fairy tale while shrouded in history (despite the few liberties it takes with historical events), Gosick is a delicious treat.\\n\\n\r\nAny constructive feedback is appreciated.",

            "content": "My first impressions of Gosick was this was going to be another, pretty good, solve/mystery type of anime. Through the first few episodes you get that impression, but then it kind of takes a left turn into romance and philosophical \"ideals\" of science and the occult. \r\nStory. Good. It does have a good pacing for the most part. It introduces you to the two main characters Kujo and Victoria/que, how they meet, their small adventures, etc, but then it turns into a sort of romance/philosophical kind of story. While I don't really mind the addition of these two things, the problem doesn't lie with thechange in direction, but rather the characters that are supposed to support this. Another thing I just found quite annoying was the ending felt rushed. It just didn't feel like it belonged at all. It's pacing was just terrible and some of the poor supporting characters just make it plain boring (which I will get to at Characters). Overall though the story was understandable, paced well and even though made a turn into way street, still managed to stay on pace for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nArt. The artwork was done very well. Not particularly the character designs, I felt they were average (which brought down the overall score), but the designs of the buildings, clothing, etc. The surroundings were just plain beautiful. The background, clothing designers of this anime did a very good job.\\n\\n\r\nSound. The music many people praised and rightfully so. The music fit the script for the most part. While the opening was done in more modern aspects, it didn't detract much from the rest of the score which tended to be more classical/orchestrated style music. Character voices didn't particularly stand out much, but the superb soundtrack makes up for it more than enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Ahhh yes the characters. Many people praised them for being somewhat unique, etc, but I found this to be one of the weakest things in all of the anime. While yes Victoria/que is pretty interesting and even some of the 1 episode characters were as well, the other main lead Kujo, was rather weak. I mean just plain bad. Kujo's character just did not seem to fit in this show. While we do get to know something about Kujo's past, it isn't enough for me at least to really want to get to know him better. Him playing the love interest of Victoria/que just makes things worse because you just don't feel that love emanate which completely kills the romance part of the entire anime. I think that if an anime is to introduce love in it's story, it's characters have to be a strong point. It just wasn't so for this show. While Victoria/que was interesting, Kujo was not and this in my opinion made the show a lot weaker. Other characters that I found rather weak, the teacher Cecile and the detective Grevil.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall. Overall I give I think this was a decent to average show that could have been more had one, ONE important character been more interesting. Kujo unfortunately in my opinion was a major let down and with the introduction of the romance portion between him and Victoria/que just plains brings down the overall score. In the end I felt rather disappointed by the show. Especially that ending, just didn't do anything or me. \\n\\n\\n",

Althought I wish characters like Avril could have gotten more screen time then she did and more involvement with the story. Because she  is a great character!\\n\\n\r\nI think this anime could have been better of being a romance serie's, because I enjoy that so much more than the mysteries, and I think some people will agree with me with that one.\\n\r\nBut I'm going to miss watching Victorque and Kujo every friday night.

Seeing Kujo save Victorique from things is very entertaining, but unfortunately most of the time this wasn't happening. For the first arcs, leading up to about halfway through the series, it had a really solid atmosphere and a great intrigue with each case they solved. This began to deteriorate as they broke into explaining about Victorique's past, leading to episodes that werequite bland and much less entertaining than the earlier episodes, containing less detective work and much more explanation. Fortunately, within the last 3 or 4 episodes, this problem was adressed and the end was very satisfying. Overall, a very good anime. It could have been a complete blowaway awesome show, but some slip ups prevented this from happening. Still, very worth watching.",

            "content": "Everything ahead is my own personal opinion, written on little sleep. Do not take anything as 100% perfect, and please try to work through parts that don't make complete sense.\r\nGosick is, to be honest, a very strange anime. Not strange as in weird or creepy, like Madoka, or even something you may have to watch multiple time, like FLCL, but it's strange because not every part of it necessarily fits together. And that's going to turn some people off.\r\nStory: 7\r\nI'm sort of torn on the story. If you were to summarize the story into one sentence, it would probably go something like: \"Gosick is aboutan extremely smart young girl and a Japanese boy who solve mysteries using science,\" or something. Now, this is all fine and dandy, even if it is a bit absurd. Many of the cases tackled are solved using a string of logic, meshing the small bits of evidence together to solve the case. It's not a particularly bad way to do it, but it's not particularly good either, as some of the cases  can become pretty confusing if you're not paying attention well enough. The small bits of evidence also don't hold up as well as the bits of evidence in say, Phoenix Write or similar more-standard detective/mystery stories. However, the cases are relatively enjoyable, even if you can see the end (or parts of the end) to some of them. However, being able to guess the end of a case is not a bad thing, as it makes everything a little more believable. \\n\r\nHowever, it quickly takes the turn of becoming a romance anime, again, something which isn't necessarily bad. I personally didn't mind it, though most of the romance is very stereotypical. Just be warned, though, if you don't like romance in your mystery, do NOT watch Gosick.\\n\r\nAt its end it is a romance anime, not a mystery anime, which, as I said before, may turn people off. However, if you take off the last episode, you have a mystery ending. While it doesn't make the cop-out of \"all these cases were one huge conspiracy!\", the cases themselves aren't connected all that much, save the end two. Each could probably exist separately, and it wouldn't have made a lick of difference.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nHonestly, there's not much to say. It's not a particularly good looking anime, but it certainly isn't ugly. There seems to be a focus on shiny and glass things, most of which look pretty good. I also really love the bright, vibrant eyes of some of the characters, but I'm a weird person, so take that as you will.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nAgain, not a whole lot to say. The sound itself is pretty standard. The music is decent, though I prefer the first OP/ED to the second. However, the game takes place in a French-speaking country, but the anime is in Japanese, of course. Normally, this wouldn't be a huge problem (like with anime that take place in English-speaking places), but there are a few times where the main character's Japanese heritage and language are referenced, which make the whole thing feel slightly awkward. Of course, I can't think of a way to fix this without changing the whole thing, so I won't be too harsh in score about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nIf you've read some of the more negative reviews on MAL, they mention how absurd the main female character (Victorique) is. How preposterous it is that a 12-year-old is outwitting practically an entire country's police force. However, it's not particularly \"magical,\" nor is it particularly absurd. If you take a sliding scale from \"average\" people to, say, savants, Victorique would be  less \"average\" and more \"savant.\" While she doesn't particularly lack many social skills, she does possess a very high intelligence, which isn't really all that strange. She simply follows a better string of logic, and is better at finding clues and relevant information than most of the characters in the story. That's all there is to it. No magic. No weirdness, and actually sort of grounded and reality. I found it pretty believable, in that respect.\\n\r\nNow, on to the rest of them. This is probably my biggest problem with the show. Every main character (and even the side characters) have personalities more fitting to a modern-day setting. I'm not saying ditzy klutz teachers and egotistical drill-hair detectives didn't exist in the early 1900s, but they just seem unfitting. However, I do get that historical accuracy does sometimes need to be sacrificed to make the characters interesting, but I think it could have been done a little more gracefully.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall:\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed watching Gosick. Before I knew it, it was over. It's a mystery anime that shifts to a love story. The filler episodes are a bit more slice-of-life, which provide a good lift from the sometimes creepy and gruesome scenarios in the main story. I think it has enough for most people to enjoy some part of it. So, as with anything, try it for a few episodes. If you end up not loving it, and find it a drag to keep watching, you don't have to finish it. We're not going to cut off your head or burn you alive or anything.",

            "content": "One of my greatest fascinations is mystery or investigative type of stories. One reason would be because it is always accompanied by other fascinating elements like psychological, horror, and suspense. Another reason would also be because it always leaves you puzzled and when you\u2019re puzzled you would think about it a lot through the day. And after all those thinking and mysteries unfold you end up so amazed of the story. Plus, it is always episodic which give you new excitement for every new case. With all these elements put into one, it is such a jackpot.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nBrilliant is theright word to describe the plot and storyline of this series. Almost all of my favorite genres are gathering here; a little bit of horror, psychological, a touch of comedy, suspense-thriller, well-made drama, an amazing love story, and tons of mysteries. Not only it is investigative and episodic but some of the cases are connected to one another as so to reveal the main plot. How amazing that can be. To be honest I am still having a hard type comprehending how the writer was able to do that. This is solving mysteries in a whole different level. It is elevated in so many ways. I am not only having goose bumps in every revelation but sometimes I end being dumbfounded. I would rewind it or stop in order to think as so to solve the mysteries myself. That\u2019s one of the greatest feeling a viewer can have. More than just a mere entertainment, you learn something, you get involve with the story, you anticipate every moment of it, and after watching the whole thing, you are moved. And that\u2019s a genuine anime experience. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nIndeed, the characters are your everyday type of characters. However, they are made as original as they can be and as if the series owns these type of characters. The father is one of the most irritating and most disgusting villains I\u2019ve ever seen. Some villains can be so irritating but at the same time they can also be admirable with their principles and beliefs on the purpose of their actions. But the villain here is plain disgusting. It is ironic that he is one of the most disgusting villains when he is so related to the main protagonist. I guess, the fact that he is related makes him a lot more disgusting. Kujo is the typical male lead partnered with tsundere types who just follow and quietly receives verbal and physical abuse. He understands and sees through the tsundere fa\u00e7ade of Victorique. Most of the time his type of character has the tendencies to become so cheesy or too dramatic but for some reason he is not irritating at all. What makes him different from that typical character is that he is not indecisive. He knows what he feels and would not hesitate to show it. Victorique\u2019s character is clich\u00e9 as well. The typical tsundere type who would not say what she truly feels and bosses around. Your everyday queen-like character that gets what she wants from the male lead. But like Kujo, she is also not irritating at all. Tsundere types have the tendencies to become so irritating because they\u2019re not so honest attitude always makes misunderstandings. However, despite not being honest with her true feelings, she would still show it if needed and would immediately realize to just show how she truly feels. Despite the queen-like attitude, she never throw tantrums or just give up in dire situation, but rather she would suck it up and be strong enough in order to keep on living. I admire her so much for being strong and staying sane despite everything that has been happening to her life but at the same time I feel sorry for her as well, for having such father. If I were her, I would feel so disgusted just by thinking that my father\u2019s blood runs inside me. I love the relationship between the protagonists. Their romance is not overly done that would make it so cheesy. Simple gestures, sweet actions, and very touching feelings towards each other are all needed to show the amazing romance of these two. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION \\n\r\nAs one of the latest series, the animation of this anime is one of the top. The illustration of one beautiful part of Europe is so beautiful. The characters are very well-made as well. The seiyu\u2019s voice is so perfect for Victorique. It genuinely brings out the character. Well, her seiyu is known voicing these types of amazing characters and she does it so well. \\n\\n\r\nThis is anime experience I will never forget. This is the very reason why I am in love with animes and mangas. More than just being entertained, I experience something so wonderful which make me feel so thankful that I am living in this type of world where such creations are being made.\\n",

            "content": "In my expierience in mystery animes, this one is different then most. Gosick is more of a romance mystery. Victorique De Blois, daughter of Cordelia, is a stubborn girl. Her friend Kujo is a sweet boy that always has something for Victorique. He puts up with her most of the time. Those are the two main characters and I'll say no more characters so I don't spoil anything. Though I'm glad the ending was the way it was. The only thing I didn't exactly like was how sad Avril would get when Kujo acted nice to Victorique. Other then that, it was a wonderful anime.",
