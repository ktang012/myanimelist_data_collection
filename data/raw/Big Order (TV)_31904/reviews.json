            "content": "I am but a mere man. I am not worthy of experiencing such greatness, but our lord and savior Mirai Nikki's Author is a merciful god. He hath brought upon us Big Order, a masterpiece that must be witnessed by all.\r\nThe story topples even the greatest of literary works. William Shakesphere and Mark Train wish they'd live to see this anime. It is about a young man named Edgy Yukiteru, who wishes to conquer the world after obtaining a Stand that allows him to control anything within an uncertain area. See how mighty Edgy is as his powers let him break out of any situationthat is most convenient for the plot! Crucial plot elements like \"drama\" and \"tension\" shalt not exist in this grand adventure, for they are mere illusions created by humans. Big Order transcends our reality and is above such trivial things, and the great god Edgy cannot hope to be harmed by anything due to his awesome power.\\n\\n\r\nBut, alas! Harsh trials await our dear Edgy, as he doesn't use his power in the most effective ways. Is it because he lacks intelligence? Heavens, no! One must not underestimate this seraph, for he is merely toying with his enemies and giving them the faintest chance of victory, allowing the intricate narrative to play its part. Such mighty foes lurk in the dark, with power over nuclear weapons and innocent hostages. Such cruelty! But that's not all! The entire world foolishly misunderstands Edgy's celestial presence as they blame him for the deaths of billions of people. With this, we are given an extraordinarily realistic representation of real people; it's as if the show were actually filmed live from a rally of the glorious Donald Trump! And even Edgy's friends are mysterious characters as he peacefully neglects to control them by force. Is there anyone he can trust!?\\n\\n\r\nYea, Edgy does indeed have a loyal follower, his lone younger sister. A pure and innocent being, she plays a key role in the story as the motivation and love interest of our hero, for his order is dedicated to only her. Such a human relationship, it's as if the show were actually filmed live from a rally of the glorious Donald Trump! The adoration of his blessed imouto fills him with determination and motivates the audience to cheer on their beloved icon even more!\\n\\n\r\nSee the intensity of the challenging duels between Order Users as they clash together; their gorgeous avatars dazzle the eyes of the audience, but only for a short time. While these battles appear to only last moments with few actions taking place, it is merely a sample of what lies hidden away. Our sinful beings are not worthy of witnessing the true battles of the gods, and such we are limited to quick brawls with ordinary tactics and simple abilities. Be grateful for what you have, mortal.\\n\\n\r\nTruly, no words can describe some of the bold details of the writing; I cannot name specifics, for that would be spoiling and therefore tarnishing the mystical plot, but you cannot prepare thy rear enough for them! Big Order is a shocking and surprising series with amazing dialogue and entertainingly absurd ideas that are sure to boggle your mind. When one thinks they know the secrets and intricate details of the world, they are greeted with new, astonishing discoveries. Such is the truth with Big Order.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is nothing short of brilliant. Edgy is truly an hero whose intellect and manliness is unmatched, as is depicted with the impregnation of Rei. His personality is locked away from all others--including us, the lesser audience. His lack of characteristics truly make him the perfect being. His short-lived accomplice, Yuno Gasai, is a murderous wench who seeks to destroy Edgy, but her attempts always end in failure, providing us with amusement. Only in Big Order shall you see menacing villains turned into comical relief! And the saintly Rei Ayanami is but an innocent wanderer in the story, but witnesses the excellence that is Edgy Yukiteru, and pledges loyalty to him for all eternity for small, simple reasons. May we all follow her example, for we too have small, simple reasons for our lives.\\n\\n\r\nAppropriately, Big Order is depicted through art that surpasses the fine works of Michael Angelo, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bob Ross, and so on. The holy Stands are gorgeously portrayed by fine computer-generated animation reminiscent of the year 2003, a golden age when shrubbery was leading a great country and Nickelodeon broadcasted amusing content. After all, if we are to go forward, we must go back. Studio Assread has once again proven to be the future of the anime industry. And no other anime has such breathtaking and unique character designs like Big Order does; they are masterfully crafted and gorgeous to watch. Some say they are \u201cfanservice-y\u201d, but that is merely a sin they have brought upon themselves for thinking such dirty things. It\u2019s only natural for a lady with rock powers to have rock-hard nipples, and it is your duty to respect that. Shame on you. It\u2019s no wonder why many viewers have reported sights of an Ultralight Beam covering much of their filthy screens; it is only visible to the eyes of sinners to prevent them from further descension. Should you repent, you may one day become capable of viewing the mature content like a responsible adult.\\n\\n\r\nAh, the great sounds of jazz! An elegant series such as this has but the most charming of music pieces to accompany it. No matter the scene or situation, the power of brass trumpets and saxophones will sound triumphantly. The opening theme, performed by none other than the esteemed Babymetal, is an explosive tune that is sure to rock the audience, and the ending credits is a haunting, hallowing experience that leaves you craving another episode. But they cannot compare to the greatness of the jazzy soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\n...Oh, dear reader. How have you managed to read this much without rushing over to HorribleSubs to legally view this sanctifying experience!? Run along, my friend! Tell your friends and family about the good news, salvation is here! We have truly found perfection, and it is none other than the ten episodes of Big Order!",

The main chararacter is the most unrelatable unbelievably arrogant bratty annoying POS MC since Light Yagami (at least Light's ideals were not so incredibly base as doing his best Hitler impression to satisfy his sister-complex), the plot is just a constant stream of deus ex machinas, there's no sense of realism whatsoever (all the characters are one dimensional and their actionis/reactions make no sense), the theme has been butchered by unnecessary OPedness of the MC (due to lack of creative problem solving), and they are so inconsistent intrying to do everything that they don't succeed at anything - not humor, not dialogue, not emotion, not mystery, not psychological warfare, not cleverness,  not action, not magic, not character development, not dark themes, not light themes. There's just so much wrong with this anime. The mangaka should commit seppuku. This anime is a complete fail. \\n\\n\r\nIf Sharknado is your favorite movie, then by all means, give this a try.

            "content": "Big Order is by far one of the most badly written shows I have seen in a very long time. The narrative resembles more so a comedy script or a parody of shows, except that the anime is trying to be serious and not trying to create any satire what so ever. While there were many parts of the anime I would put into the \"so bad it's good bin\" by the end, the narrative became even more of a convoluted mess and all fun I had with the series quickly diminished. Hell, when I saw the announcement for this show, I initially thought itwas going to be a slice of life show about working in the fast food industry or some shit, since I knew nothing about it before hand, but what we got was in fact, far worse than that. After learning that in fact it was the same author as Mirai Nikki, I understood why it was such a big mess but I think this is far worse than Mirai Nikki in terms of writing, normally an author gets better over time, not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nHell, near enough all the characters look exactly like Mirai Nikki characters, especially the new girl to replace Yuno Gasi and this problem is even worse in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is perhaps the most stupid thing I have ever seen. It starts off with an extremely vague flying chick who goes around granting wishes to people and after asking the main character about one hundred fucking times he replies by saying he wants to destroy the world, being largely influenced by his favorite cartoon...the world was destroyed by a FUCKING cartoon. Anyway, we cut ten years into the future (because fuck continuity) were we see the world has not been destroyed and even after a massive calamity, society seems to have progressed enough to build another school. Like, what the fuck. I certainly haven't lived through a disaster like the world being destroyed but I highly doubt a school or sometimes whole cities would still be running, but hey, who gives a fuck. It also turns out that the fairy woman thing was granting wishes to many other people giving them powers to make their wishes come true and these people are referred to as 'orders' and are hated by the general public.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if Daisy was granting random wishes to people, then why on earth didn't anyone wish for the world to be fixed or something? Was Eiji the last person she ever granted a wish to? Anyway, Eiji is our main character who pissed me off straight away from his introduction. He is an edgy as fuck teenager and the world hates him, while also having a rather intimate relationship with his sister. Why? I don't fucking know, incest is going to be in every shitty show now? And it's not like it's subtle either, they literally have sex with each other and everything. While on his way home from school he is attacked by a Yuno clone (minus everything that made Yuno a fun character). She vows vengeance on Eiji since his wish caused the great destruction which killed her parents. During this fight, he showcases his power which literally looks like a poor man's version of a stand from JoJo. In fact, every power is literally a JoJo stand except they're all CG and look like shit and none of the powers are ever developed or explained. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Eiji can control things within his 'domain' and manipulate things within that space to do whatever he says...so not only is this show like JoJo, it's also like Code Geass, he even wants to take over the world in the name of peace like Lelouch. While Yuno-clone is in this domain, she is unable to kill Eiji but over the course of the show begins to fall in love with him which is the dumbest thing I've ever heard because he kinda says that he will marry her or something...this makes no fucking sense.\\n\\n\r\nAfter deciding to take over the world for the sake of world peace and to protect his sister and is made king of some kind of organisation or whatever... I don't fucking care anymore. Why should I care when the anime gives me no reason to. We're introduced to all these characters who are supposedly the strongest but they barely have any screen time and pretty much are useless\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is all over the god damn place and nothing makes any sense what so ever. Things happen at random, all of the characters are stupid beyond belief. We rush through the plot at break neck speed never allowing for any plot or character development at all. No character is likeable in the slightest and no one is ever developed. For a while, the show could be pretty entertaining since it was so bad it was good. Such as in episode 4 when a nuke is dropped right above Eiji's head and he stops it his bare hands. Wouldn't it explode? Why didn't the people aim the nuke a few miles away from their location to ensure that it can't be stopped? Who fucking cares.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tries way too hard to be edgy featuring plenty of leg and arm amputations and some of the worst censoring I have seen in a long time for any kind of nudity. Don't you love scenes that are 90% white light? \\n\\n\r\nThere were some parts that were just fucking dumb. Like the one scene in which Eiji touches the ears of the Miko character and she becomes pregnant. What the fuck.\\n\\n\r\nThe powers are never explained and lack any originality. The characters are boring and badly written, there is crappy animation and bad CGI, dull script, extremely forced plot twists that make no sense near the end and combining that with one of the worst endings I have ever seen makes for one of the worst anime of this year.",

            "content": "Before I begin my review, let me get it off my chest and say that I am not one of those elite posers or trolls who is quick to hop on the bandwagon and immediately dislike the show because the original creator was Sakae Esuno, the original artist and author of Mirai Nikki or Future Dairy (whichever you prefer.) \r\nLet me start with this, between Future Diary and Big order, with this series it's like characters that didn't make it into The future diary got their own spin-off thus Big order was born. Just watching the first episode, the  similarities with the characters andto a certain degree the story are of course obvious. Certain characters resemble, and to a certain extent act/behave almost the way characters in Future Diary did. In all honesty, it's like he made the same story twice but (Obviously) tweaked little things in the story, plot, etc to try to give Big order its own unique individuality. For the most part I think that it works out pretty well. I'm not saying that Sakae is a bad writer, it's just that he needs to do a better job with making better distinctions with each of his works, that way it doesn't feel like the two shows are blending into each other. Unless of course he's doing this to make it seem like they take place in the same sort of universe however... we all (most of us) know how the universes in Future Dairy work out.. cough cough.  That aside, I could not establish any type of commitment to the story [for the most part.] I will certainly say that it is not Esuno's best work however, I am roughly around 86.7% convinced that he can do a better job with creating an engaging and intensely dramatic story-line [along with plot] that's not only fun to watch but also really keeps viewers like me satisfied and engaged with what's going on. To me it seems like he purposely adds, or \"tries too hard\" to keep his work \"dark\" while trying to add fear into the factor and it just wasn't working for me. I mean, [and I'm going to try to stop bringing up the future dairy because again this is a different work] with the future dairy I was very satisfied with The story & plot. It was full of drama and the studio, producers, and director did a great job of adding mystery and a bit of action parts to the story. Which kept me engaged for a majority of the time.  \\n\r\nBig order really felt like (and I hate to use this word) but laziness, pure laziness. Now things did pick up for me after episode 5. To me, this is the point where the show finally start getting somewhat serious in both dialogue and starting drama. I cannot spoil anything but I loved the intense amount of dramatic battles, fights between Eiji and his squad. I was glad that things started to pick up in Big order. Because there are only 10 episodes, if things didn't pick up around episode 5-6 I probably would've lost interest and dropped it. Il would probably had stuck to my guns and watched it anyway simply because once I start a show I make a commitment to see it through. Overall, I felt like dialogue between characters was dull, action scenes didn't really land a spark and it lacked an engaging story-line along with plot. I gave the 6.5 outta 10 because I didn't feel like Sakae had used his full potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, special effects, and CGI used during the show were pretty good however nothing major stands out too much to me. When I'm watching battle scenes I often times felt like it was missing a certain charm.  Perhaps they lacked intensity & replay value.  I was expecting, \"unless of course I missed some\" Easter eggs or references of the future dairy, I mean I saw the ball that Kami-Musubi had looked like the same one Tsubaki in Future dairy owned however, as far as I saw, that is the limit to how far Easter eggs go. Now character designs, the resemblances, I felt like at the very least the producers could have at least adjusted Eiji, Tairano, Daisy, Rin, and so many other characters original designs to look much different. This is because they stand out too much and look like the future dairy cast. They appear as cheesy, uninspired rip offs.  Sakae shouldn't draw Yukiteru and make him look more mature and call him \"Eiji.\" He shouldn't draw  Yuno make her look like a dolled up idol star and call her \"Daisy.\" More importantly he should not! and I mean should not! have taken Yuno's infamous \"Yandere archetype\" and Minene's cold, tough girl attitude and gave it to Kurenai I just think that lacks a bit of creativity. Overall, despite all of this I'm still satisfied with the final results.\\n\\n\r\nI disliked all the characters. I don't know how much I can go into so I'll just put it bluntly. Big order has the most dullest, and lackluster characters I have seen in some time. Each character lacked their own unique individuality. As I mentioned many times before, the characters, for the most part are just copy and pasted from Mirai Nikki albeit with some changes. Character growth and development wasn't exciting because Eiji literally has an OP gift \"order.\" Although he does have this power he is often times beaten by other important characters but of course he cannot lose because you know, he's the main character. If I had to change anything from Esuno's work,  I would make characters more appealing in terms of personality, uniqueness and how they appeal to the viewers. Creativity and most importantly memorable characters in big order isn't possible for me because again, all I saw was laziness.  Overall I was beyond disappointed with the characters and this is the first time! This is perhaps the first and hopefully the last time I have to watch a show with a cast full of bad characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty good but no too impressive. Music is not as powerful and dramatic as the future diary soundtrack however, there are  still has a few good songs here to hear playing in the background here and there. Voice actors were pretty good so I don't have much to complain about in that department. Overall I didn't care too much about the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just say that I wasn't exactly too fond of what I watched. I'm not going to say that it was completely bad because, as I mentioned earlier, the show does deliver lots of great moments however, in the long run, I felt like it was wasted potential. Overall I think it needed a lot of work in story and especially the characters department.",

            "content": "*spoilers for Big Order*\r\nBig Order is an enigma. It's beyond our comprehension, in the worst way possible. It throws you for all kinds of loops in the dumbest, more surreal ways imaginable, thinking that's it's a clever, emotional, deep, and truly thought-provoking being when in reality, it's a sloppy, horrifically told mess. Trying to really understand everything about it is to succumb to a Lovecraftian horror that will destroy your mind and soul since it actually manages to be both convoluted in all the potentially interesting and deep ways while fucking it all up and being convoluted the wrong ways. It doesn't answer all theright questions we are left with, and it sometimes answers them in ways that make things worse. Hell, it doesn't even understand the revolting implications of some of its characters actions, so how the hell can it expect to understand the major plot it has created?\\n\\n\r\nIt's actually futile to try to understand this anime since it doesn't even understand itself that well. It's like it's final antagonist, trying to delve deep into something it was never gonna truly get, making detrimentally wrong decisions, and losing sight of what it tried to do as it went and tried to one-up itself in \"craftiness\" and \"mind-bending twists\". It knows what it's trying to be, but that it's trying to be is something it cannot handle, which is truly fitting given that many of its characters suffer that exact same fate. So, just how badly did Big Order implode in on itself? Or rather, just what happened to make it suffer that fate? Well, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nBasically, 10 years ago, Eiji made a wish that ended up destroying the world, add that wish was to dominate it for world peace. Now, you're asking why didn't he say \"I want world peace\"? The thing is, it wasn't his actual wish, it was his sister's. I know I'm jumping the gun but I need to tackle this early. The flashbacks make it seem like she's a girl who can comprehend full conversations and the state of our worlds as well as empathy by then we learn she was only 3, making this make little sense since actual 3 year olds don't do any of that. I know this because the flashback specifically states 10 years ago, as well as the fact that in the final episode, she turns 14 soon after the major events of the final episode. Now, basically, the plot tries to one up itself in terms of stringing its MC along for all sorts of twists, turns, betrayals, etc., so let's tackle some of them, as well as a few other moments and see what went wrong, shall we? After all, it's hard to really describe the plot well given how wrecked it is, but we can attack it's logic and see why the story falters, in sort of a rapid fire kind of fashion, though this isn't my usual formula.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Kurenai Rin stabs Eiji's sister (Sena) in the shoulder with a sword and she bleeds horribly, you'd expect that when Eiji reaches her far more than 10 minutes later given how the episode presents itself, that she would actually be dead from blood loss. Eiji takes down two heavily armed and protected dudes by going ham with a sign (that was never shown), so yeah, that's dumb. If Rin wanted to finish off Eiji herself, she definitely shouldn't have ordered her men to riddle him with bullets (regardless of the fact that it didn't even work). When Eiji effectively puts her in his dominion, or rather, when he uses his order to block the shots before he uses his dominion order, she, for no reason, heals Sena and he never even ordered to. She wants to know why, and neither she nor we get a definite answer since we never hear him tell her to heal his sister. Barring the stuff I listed above that ultimately is explained away by the big Sena twist, this is basically all of the really crazy illogical moments from episode 1. Keep that in mind. Also at the end of the episode, Eiji uses his Order avatar to wrap Rin and given the audio and the way the episode fades to black for the credits, it basically sounds like he basically forced her into tentacle rape, and I'm not sure if they really wanted that implication or maybe they did it as a joke. Dunno.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters betray each other for no good reason. I mean, Franc betrays the group in episode 7 for no adequately explained reason only to do a face turn, only to do another heel turn in the finale. Characters also try to outsmart each other all the time, to varying and often pathetic degrees of success in terms of making any sense, like how in episode 4, one of the 10 members working for them was pretending to work for the enemy by giving the enemy heavily compromising information that jeopardizes his side's own plans to nearly getting their pawn (Eiji) killed (even though it easing their own order), or well, everything in one ginormous sequence in episode 7 that amounts to the two leaders trying to outwit each other until they are betrayed by one of their own (Rin for the bad guys and Franc for the \"good guys\", except Rin's was a part of the bad guys' plan). It's like the writer(s) decided to try to make the story one-up itself in terms of convoluted schemes of planning around plans and adding in betrayals regardless of whether or not it can be easy enough to remotely follow or if it all makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters also don't use their OP AF powers on ways that actually make good sense in their situations. There are a few notable accounts of this. Episode 3: Eiji has the Group of 10 (what a boring name) under his dominion and claims to be in control (though that's what they want), and he doesn't even do anything to bind them under his will aside from \"don't leave my domain\". If he really wanted to be in control, he should've tried to make them actually submit to his power and decisions via his dominion instead of saying \"you're in my dominion\" and expecting them to just follow him and not get him entangled in their scenes. Episode 6: A swordsman has an inter-dimensional sword that can slash between dimensions, and when he has Eiji and Iyo in his sights (as well as a now useless colleague and Kuroko (the Miko of vitality and couples in episode 6 who is gorgeous AF), he swipes vertically to kill the latter two. Even if it's revealed that Eiji needed to be alive for his father (the main antagonist), did he swordsman know that? Why not swipe vertically to kill everyone, or if he knew that he needed Eiji alive, why not depends diagonally to try to cut off a limb to make him more susceptible to capture? Episode 10: Sena Wishes dominion over the world for world peace. Even if she was basically 3 at the time, why didn't she just wish for world peace? So that the plot could happen? There had to have been better ways of making this work, like maybe trying to justify why she didn't (like maybe she wanted to emulate the world domination aspect of her idol book comic character, or maybe she didn't think it through at all). Instead, she wished for world domination and couldn't handle the power so it fucked over the world. Also, when Eiji wished to shoulder all of the damage she did with that wish, how does it equate to him taking her power, messing both his and her memories, and basically suppressing and replacing their memories of their father? Bah! Moving on!\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, this show doesn't understand any of the downright horrible implications of some of the characters' actions. Let's run down the list, shall we? The Group of Ten basically leaked info to basically ruin a high schooler's life by turning the world against him and manipulating him into their schemes just so they can kill his father and stop his plans, even knowing that both he and his sister were crucial in his plot. That literally makes no sense and the fact that they expect him to go along with it is especially galling. They basically made him a global pariah worse than Adolf Hitler, so no shit he often has a hard time of complying! In episode 4, Eiji and Sena are in bed with him on top in a very sexual position, and then we next see all of their clothes on the floor and an open shower curtain. Regardless of the fact that we only blatantly know that they're just showering together, it's very creepy for a teenage boy to shower with his not much younger sister at their ages. Also, given all of this context, you can imagine that the implications of actual incest run rampant here, which is just not good. Hell, the fact that she kisses him in the final episode of the anime (without any context to blatantly suggest otherwise), it's basically confirmed that she was wanting to have incest with him, or at least heavy implications make it come off that way.\\n\\n\r\nTime for this last example to really sell my point home. In episode 9, Iyo has Eiji handcuffed to a bed with just his shirt off and they take off their clothes, but he is trying to decline sex in favor of current matters, and given the context of what's going on, it's implied from the anime that she was already sorta having sex anyway thanks to Eiji's line about her going any deeper, and again, he never actually consented and she was still trying to have sex with him. Does that sound like rape to you, because it does to me. Don't try to give me some bullshit spheal about \"women can't rape men, that's not how that works; at worst, it's only physically possible for it to be sexual harassment or assault\" since she had him chained up to something without his knowledge or consent and is trying to have (and given the anime's context, likely in the middle of having) sex regardless of his declining (likely because he'd rather save it for a time where his sister wasn't in danger) so that counts as attempted rape, even if none of the characters realize it as such. Do you see what I mean by horrid implications that no character seems to take into consideration regarding their actions!\\n\\n\r\nBefore we get to the real meat of the convoluted nature of the series, let\u2019s also smash a few weird ass scenes apart since, well, this anime is beyond strange. The ultimate example of this is the beginning of episode 5. Kagekiyo basically grabs and fondles the tits of Rin, Mari (the chick with the glasses and lasers), and Iyo, all while basically having an orgasm over their \u201ctwin peaks\u201d when she fondles them enough, getting her ass kicked every time, brushing it off like it's nothing before moving to her next target, and not learning not to be such a perv to other women. All this scene adds is time and discomfort. I've already talked about the episode 4 scene that really hints at incest, so I'll tackle one more scene: Eiji gets an arm and a leg cut off in episode 8, and the moment he uses the Eiji x Iyo fusion of his Order avatar, he can suddenly manipulate his limbs to attach to him for no reason other than asspulls since it was never shown to be able to do that. I know orders defy conventional logic, but they only do that via the user\u2019s ordered actions, not by nature of their existence.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s this whole thing about how the people hate Order users because they hate Eiji for what happened to the world. Problem is, the way they go about this is hamfisted. Civilians in this show are absurdly hateful and are portrayed in this vicious, uncivilized, basically evil light. Also, you know, it seems like none of them try to move on from their grief and put it past them in order to try to live a better life. I get that their families were killed and their lives were inverted but everyone comes off as insanely hateful for the sake of it. I'll address the final thing that makes the civilians on the show horrible when we get there.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, time to delve into the big plot of the second half. Given that the anime ended a few months before the manga did, I can only assume that all of this, or at least a good chunk of it (namely the final episode or 3) was filler, though even with the research I did (without reading the manga or knowing someone who has) I cannot prove this. Well, it turns out that the Group of 10 were initially meant to track down and kill Genai, Eiji\u2019s father, and you can refer to a few paragraphs ago on why that is horse shit when taking everything into account. Also, the bad guys are tracking down and trying to kill mikos. Apparently it's because they are involved in this pentagram involved with the gate to this mental world that he wants to unlock because it was Sena that originally did so, though she couldn't control it, causing the world to be ravaged, apparently so that he can create an infinite amount of parallel universes, including ones where Sena\u2019s wish was granted and she was happy and world peace, even if it means forsaking the universe that we are currently seeing our characters in and everyone storms the place and betrayals and Eiji denouncing his goal and getting stabbed by his sister and then fusing orders and kicking ass and winning and God shows up and the world is now good and now that means everyone sees Eiji as a hero which makes no sense given how much whiplash that is with how hateful they were and good ending and blah blah blah! I'm not even gonna question any more aspects of the finale like the memory parasite robots or anything since my mind is fried beyond belief. \\n\\n\r\nAnother crucial problem is that very few of these characters have any remotely interesting personality to speak of, so I'll prattle a lot of them off quick. The Group of 10 are mostly useless, with only a few of them being relevant like the leader, Mari, Iyo, and 3 other dudes who only do one specific thing like flying, teleporting, and punching, and some of them are so useless that they don't even have any real screen time, and of course, each of them is basically one note and dull, even the fun-loving flying and punching dudes are just meh, and are just there for deus ex machinas. Even the main character Eiji is a boring teen protagonist who is basically Lelouch if he had the personality of an ordinary school protagonist, including his devotion to making his sister happy. Rin is just an annoying chick who always wants to kill Eiji until one final sappy scene where she motivates him in the final episode. Also, yeah, different hair color aside, her design is strikingly similar to that of Yuno from Mirai Nikki. Kagekiyo is just a vengeful and quirky person who also happens to be a total perv (and probably either bi or lesbian given the twin peaks scene in episode 5), and is basically irrelevant aside from episodes 3 and 4, and one scene in the finale. Also, Sena is basically a worse Nunnally who sorta is in love with her brother and is the one  actually responsible for the world ending. Plus, her heel turn in episode 9 was abominable.\\n\\n\r\nNow into the full-blown antagonists. I don't even think most of them have names aside from Jyuubei (the sword guy) and Genai (the main antagonist). Aside from Genso, there nothing but generic, borderline personality-less baddies. It's sad when Fairy Tail can come up with tons of evil teams (Oraci\u00f3n Seis, Tartarus, Grimoire Heart, Phantom Lord, and a good few others) that have each and every character have some kind of defined personality with some of them getting sort of fleshed out, and in rarer cases, even developed and yet no one here has a truly concrete personality aside from the most generic templates of a personality. Genai has this weird obsession with flowers and the series tries its damnedest to make him a sympathetic scientist father whose plans drove him insane and ruined everything for everyone, but when they can't even do a good job with his backstory, the backstory about him for one of the characters, or even how despite supposedly  caring so much for Eiji and Sena he never actually shows care after the major incident (he never looks for them orthopedic to get others to do the same, and he doesn't care how badly their hurt as long as they're alive and useful), even he misses the mark. \\n\\n\r\nI can't even really begin to describe Daisy in any way that isn't how much teasing he does to Eiji about his powers and memories. She is as much of an enigma as the show itself, and I don't think it was as intentional as you might think since we know nothing about her backstory other than the fact that she was used as the vessel of an experiment that caused her to become some kind of floating person that hands out Orders. We never really see that from her perspective, nor does she really have anything concrete about her aside from her great looks and how much she teases Eiji about pertinent information. What was she like before? Did the change affect her in any way? Why did she get a job as a waitress at the end of the series! Despite being one of the more prominent characters in the series, I probably have the least feel for what kind of personality she has. Also, the only Miko we get to know aside from Iyo is Kuroko, a beautiful lady who has perfect vitality and spend her days basically forging couples, and it's funny to hear her get annoyed when Eiji and Iyo don't understand one another and have awkward moments despite them being obviously the pair that will be a couple, though she doesn't really get to do much since she was killed off unceremoniously. She was, all things considered, the best character in the show, and when a basically one-off character is the best character in your entire series, that's pretty pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nThe character art...is inconsistent. Sometimes it looks amazing, with all sorts of wonderful shading to complement the (mostly) wonderful (albeit sometimes borderline copy paste) character designs, and other times, it looks flat with characters having none of that shading. It would've been great if Studio Asread were capable of doing what Studio Wit did with Kabaneri and managed to have the perfect shading all the time instead of only sometimes, but hey, it's better than having the flat looking moments for the characters all the time. Only one design looks terrible and that's Kagekiyo\u2019s, especially with those absurdly pointy nipples that stick out from her g-string big time. The actual animation isn't spectacular but ultimately competent, despite a few laughable moments like the way Eiji turns/slides in episode 2 (I bet you know the scene I'm talking about). The censorship is pretty terrible though, but not as horrid as the usual black bars or even black circles. The kaleidoscope imagery looked nice though, even if the series doesn't really do well in terms of having contrasting light and shadow in the same frame. Also, the CGI is pretty terrible, not just with the avatars, but especially with the nukes in episode 4 and just how prevalent the CGI is, also bogs it all down, especially since it doesn't work well with the aesthetic of the series, nor does it look good on its own. I do at least like when the imagery gets really triply like with the world destruction and with most of the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP \u201cDisorder\u201d by Yousei Teikoku...is certainly fitting in terms of its chaotic nature and how much of a mess Big Order is. I don't particularly like it, especially in comparison to some of her other songs like Mirai Nikki OP 1 or Deus\u2019s character song. The ED \u201cKobore Sekai Oware (\u6bc0\u30ec\u4e16\u30ab\u30a4\u7d42\u30ef\u30ec)\" by Aki Hata is...fascinating. Both somewhat unnerving and simultaneously alluring. I really like it, more so than any other piece of music in the series. The Actual OST is somewhat ok but is really unfitting (with tons of jazz pieces that sound like they\u2019d be playing at certain parts of a fun spy series instead of an anime like this), and some of them, especially the track \u201cDominate\u201d are played over and over again and it gets annoying since none of the tracks (aside from track 7) are particularly good. It's not that they're bad, it's that they are overused and ill-fitting most of \\n\\n\r\nFor a while now, Big Order was easily the most enjoyable train wreck I had ever seen. It's decisions were so baffling and out of left field that I couldn't help but laugh my ass off constantly throughout the first 6 episodes. It wasn't enjoyable in the conventional sense and the episodes got increasingly aggravating, but the last 4 episode felt more aggravating than funny bad, mainly due to how it grew stale and unbelievably convoluted, and the fact that it tried harder than ever to be serious and heartfelt rather than crazy and fun in terms of what it was trying to do. I don't actually hate the ending, partially because I couldn't even care anymore and my mind was crashing like Hindenburg or the Titanic, and blowing up like a Megaman boss. I was more distraught by its failures than infuriated or poised to laugh at them in the last 4 episodes, especially the finale. Plus, certain implications and true ramifications of situations really broke me at times. Nonetheless, I can say that for most part, I consider it to be the first truly effective schlock title I have ever seen, in the way that I laughed my ass off constantly throughout a majority of the run, for whatever that's worth.\\n\\n\r\nBig Order is an absolute mess. It's not just convoluted, but stupidly confusing and confusingly stupid. It becomes legitimately hard to grasp as to what is actually wrong with the story and what is just convoluted and/or absurd but intentional and not harmful. As your mind tries to parse all that, as well as the awful CGI and constant kaleidoscope imagery, as well as the unfitting music that makes you speculate as to what kind of series the OST would better suit, it all moves along at breakneck speeds. It's mentally taxing for sure, and not even mostly good character art, a few good songs, or even kaleidoscope imagery can remotely salvage that. You actively need to be mentally prepared to sit through this show or you will be left in the dust worse than any unprepared schmuck watching episode 20 of Ergo Proxy, which is an actually good anime that comes off as very convoluted at times. Big Order is a big pile \u2018o shit and it deserves its dismal rating. It's sort of fascinating in a way if you\u2019re capable of keeping up somewhat with the absurd narrative and decisions of the show, which is probably its biggest strength despite being fully comprised of the show\u2019s fatal flaws. Only watch this if you're an expert at ripping bad anime to shreds. Everyone else, spare your brain cells. With all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains some spoilers for this masterpiece known as Big Order.\r\nI'm fully confident to say that Big Order is the most misunderstood anime ever released, the fact that it has such a low score everywhere is truly baffling to me.\r\nNow wait, calm down. Drop those stones you're holding there and hear me out for a bit! I too once thought Big Order was a shitshow, especially because its author is the same fella who wrote that ungodly abomination called Mirai Nikki, and Big Order was full of random bullshit just like the previous series, which actually makes me question why Mirai Nikki hasa higher score than this when both are essentially terribly-written trainwrecks that fail at every single thing they try to do... Or is it really how things are? Well, for Mirai Nikki that's definitely the case, but Big Order finally clicked with me on rewatch and I realized that the series is actually a lot smarter than most people think, because unlike Mirai Nikki, it actually treats its absurdly dumb plot points and twists like absurdly dumb plot points and twists! Big Order doesn't try to paint itself as some kind of brilliant 2deep4u work of art like Mirai Nikki does, it's actually quite the opposite: When you're watching it and say \"wow that's fucking ridiculous\", Big Order turns to you and says \"I KNOW RIGHT?\" as it pulls another unbelievable twist right out of its ass in a glorious never-ending show of ingeniously crafted shitstorms. \\n\\n\r\nIt's almost like Sakae Esuno is actually aware of how terrible Mirai Nikki was and decided to make Big Order into a parody of his previous work, laughing at himself for actually writing that garbage without the smallest bit of self-awareness, and maybe even laughing at people who actually think Mirai Nikki is a good series without being ironic about it. Yes, my friends, Sakae Esuno incorporated shitposting into anime and manga before it became a popular thing to do nowadays with shows like Pop Team Epic, Berserk 2016 and Darling in the FranXX. I haven't read the Big Order manga, but the anime adaptation even adds to the shitposting by having a soundtrack that couldn't be any less out-of-place with \"heavy\" and \"dark\" scenes playing out as some bouncy jazz is playing on the background, it's clearly a deliberate move on the director and/or the composer for this anime, they're well aware of the true nature of Big Order and were happy to play along with Sakae Esuno's joke. I like to think that there's a bunch of ninjas who are always playing jazz while hiding themselves somewhere in the scenery, you'll never see them, but you certainly know they're around, and the characters in the series may also know of that, but they choose to ignore the background noise because there's always too much going on.\\n\\n\r\nDo you doubt that Big Order is a spoof of Mirai Nikki, and maybe even some other terribly-written anime? Alright then, explain to me why the protagonist Eiji and one of the girls in his ever-growing harem, Rin, have such a strong similarity with Yukiteru and Yuno from Mirai Nikki in their character designs! Is it because Esuno can only draw those types of characters and nothing more? Of course not, his other manga seems to have fairly distinct character designs, so why would he replicate characters from Mirai Nikki specifically for this particular series? I rest my case. But relax, just because these characters look like Yukiteru and Yuno, doesn't mean that they're the same, Eiji shows more balls in one episode of Big Order than Yukiteru shows in the entirety of Mirai Nikki for once, and Rin isn't really a yandere who wants to keep everyone away from Eiji's cock, in fact she actually hates him and wants him dead for most of the story, obviously because Esuno wants them to be the anti-Yukiteru and Yuno as part of the joke. The basic premise of the story is that there's a bunch of people known as Orders who have Stands with unique abilities each, because no shitposting anime would be fully realized without a JoJo reference, and Eiji is one of those people, he also apparently made some kind of fucked-up wish that caused the apocalypse and people hate him a little bit because of that, but he doesn't give a shit, he's got a cute little imouto called Sena who has AIDS and will die in a few months, but bigger than her disease is her lust for some onii-sama D, so he's just fine. However, it all changes when Rin tries to kill Eiji, which leads him to re-awakening his Stand power, which happens to be the Geass of Absolute Obedience! Thus, Eiji forces Rin to marry him and proceeds to legally rape her with his stand's pointy tentacles as the screen fades to black and some smooth jazz plays on the background.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, Eiji becomes buddies with a bunch of other people who are also Orders and want to take over the world, but most of them don't really matter much aside from the bunny girl called Iyo who gets pregnant because Eiji touches her ribbon... Yes, she says that anyone who touches her ribbon which acts like bunny ears will impregnate her... This actually fucking happens! They take her to a nearby hospital, the nurse says a baby is coming out and later they actually have a discussion about pregnancy and raising kids. How in the world can anyone actually think this was meant to be taken seriously? The show is obviously taking the piss, you're supposed to laugh at how absurd this set-up for a \"romance\" subplot is and be on the edge of your seat for whatever the hell the series will want to throw at you next, and I assure that you won't be disappointed. I don't even want to spoil much of the plot, Big Order such an unpredictable beast that I could be ruining the experience if I spill out too much, and for the record, I showed this series to a friend of mine without letting her know much of what it's like, and she laughed her ass off from beginning to end, which is how we are all meant to react to it.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, the opening is pretty neat, yeah.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the only complaint I have about Big Order is the fact that it's only 10 episodes long, but... Oh God, it's 10 episodes of pure, unadulterated hilarity.",

When starting this masterpiece you are introduced to some quirky characters, but what I told you that none of this matters because this happens to be the worlds longest BURGER KING commercial to ever be recorded. A sane person would be asking himself \"how does this show pertain to burger king?\" Well that's easy to answer, the main characters \"BigOrder\" is to literally have it his way which is the slogan the company introduced in early as the 1980s. It doesn't just end there with their famous slogan because the main character never shuts up about having it his way when it comes to women or even the world. In the end all I have to say is 10/10 had it my way",

            "content": "Unless you've been living under a rock in recent years, you've at least heard of the 2011 anime Mirai Nikki, known as Future Diary in English. Its one of the most popular anime of the last few years, though its reception is very mixed, with some people loving it and others flat-out despising it. A few years after it finished, another series by that series' mangaka was announced to get an anime adaptation for the Spring 2016 season. That series, of course, being Big Order. While opinions on Mirai Nikki are rather split, most can agree with something about Big Order. Its trash.\r\nThe series revolvesaround the concept of the aptly named \"Orders\", which are powers that originate via one's own wishes. Our story primarily focuses on Hoshimiya Eiji, a boy who supposedly caused an apocalypse that wiped out most of the population. As a result of this, he's despised by pretty much everyone, even so far as to get an assassin hired solely for killing him and him alone. Eiji now is on the run and has to save his sister, who is suffering from an illness likely to kill her in a few months. Well, that's what the story SUPPOSEDLY is. In actuality, the plot of Big Order is a huge pile of nonsense. The series can't decide on if it wants to be serious or silly. One of the biggest examples of this is when Eiji makes a miko pregnant but touching her bunny ears of all things during a major chase sequence (just roll with it), causing her belly to instantly swell up. Now, that may SEEM like a big plot point, but they decide to pretty much throw the idea away immediately in the next episode, pretty much making the supposed pregnancy subplot a complete waste of time. This is also one of those shows that thinks that shoving tits and ass into your story automatically redeems it, which it really doesn't. Some plot elements also feel like they're made up on the spot (and not even foreshadowed) solely to create Deus Ex Machinas. Most of the few things in this show that AREN'T incomprehensible are overall dull and feel like they were lazily copied from other manga/anime. (Such as how the Orders have an uncanny resemblance to the Stands from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure) Lastly, the pacing is so ridiculously fast that you have no idea on what's even going on. This is not helped by the atrocious world-building, or lack there of. In addition to having nothing in this world explained, there are some major inconsistencies. For instance, this is apparently a post-apocalyptic setting, but somehow, news buildings and schools survive because plot convenience. How lovely.\\n\\n\r\nBig Order's characters suffer from being both bland and unlikable. Eiji is the stereotypical edgy and obnoxiously loud shounen protagonist with some siscon thrown in for good measure (but its not incest cause they're not blood-related hurr durr (and yes, this IS something in the actual show)). Rin I guess is supposed to be a Yandere, but she lacks the charm of other characters of her type, and only acts according to the plot regardless of whether it fits her character, resulting in a blank slate basically. Sena is Eiji's blood-unrelated sister, and who we are supposed to sympathize for because she's cute and nothing more; even getting asspats by her brother even when she turns out to be a part of one of the major conflicts. The rest of the cast is so forgettable that I don't even remember their names. And considering that there's a lot of them, that's pretty bad. We're just introduced to them suddenly and the audience can't even feel to have a grasp of who they are (their actions make them come off as unmemorable at best); and at most they just serve as plot devices. They attempt to build romantic relationships, but the characters have no chemistry whatsoever so you can't feel invested in any of the romances present.\\n\\n\r\nProduction wise I suppose it looks decent. There are several neat-looking effects used within each episode, though at times they feel sloppily done (particularly in the last episode). The OST, on the other hand, is generally cheesy 80's pop and doesn't even remotely fit in with the designated scenes, and as such, it kills any tension those scenes might've had.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing big about Big Order is that it's a big mess. With a shoddily put together story, a dull cast of characters, and sheer laziness through out, Big Order offers nothing to the table, and as such, I suggest avoiding it like the plague. Now, there is something that may make Big Order somewhat recommendable. Its a great show to laugh at. Even then, its outclassed in that aspect even within its own season. Take Mayoiga, a series that provides the same unintentional hilarity, but at least it's made by staff who want to have fun first and foremost, even if it's not to everyone's liking. Not saying that Mayoiga's even remotely a good show unironically, but at least it's not this.",

Not bad as Divine Gate which is very disappointing. \r\nBig Order may seems like Mirai Nikki trying to do Code Geass because the character have special power to order someone like Code Geass and the design is similar from Mirai Nikki. But that actually make things interesting, it looks like a spin off.\r\nStory is 7, because the first few episode is not very original but there are lots of plot twist along the way evenat episode 10, you cannot expect what will happen next. \\n\\n\r\nArt is 8, I can't complain enough because its great, the design is like Mirai Nikki with some awesome CG animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound is 7, because there is awesome opening by Yousei Teikoku which takes me back dreaming about Mirai Nikki. But the ending is horrible and so creepy.\\n\\n\r\n(Major spoiler coming through) \\n\r\nCharacter is 6, because I admit it that the character development is not very good maybe because of the mind erasing and brain washing (spoiler from episode 10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is 8, because there are many mind blowing scene including fan service and weird-nuts things like getting pregnant when someone touch the bunny ears hahaha (spoiler from episode 3) \\n\\n\r\nOverall is 9, the conclusion is Big Order is not bad and not very good also, so I'm just hopping more people on MAL will rate it 7 or 6 instead of 1 or 2. \\n\\n",

            "content": "How original! A Big Order review with a 1! But instead of explaining all the little details as to why this show sucks so much, I will explain why it deserves a 1 with a much more simple reason.\r\nBig Order is one of those shows were 15 minutes after I finish an episode, I completely forget what the hell I just watched.\r\nNot because the story is complex or deep, meaning the forgetting of a few themes here and there is only natural. (Big Order is a thematically heavy show but really who cares?)\r\nNot because I didn't want to remember anything, since the show was sucha chore to watch in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nBut because remembering anything about this show would be detrimental to my health. Scientists call it post-traumatic amnesia. A state of confusion that occurs after a traumatic brain injury. That's Big Order in a nutshell.\\n\\n\r\nQuiz me on anything about Big Order and I'll probably either not remember anything, or my brain will shut itself off and I'll fall into a deep coma in order to protect my sanity from the nightmare fuel that is Big Order.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll probably be like \"YO THIS MEANS YOUR REVIEW IS INACCURATE CAUSE AMNESIA! YOUR INFO IS FAULTY!\" While my info may be faulty, I'm one of the many victims of this travesty, and we are first hand sources.\\n\\n\r\nI see a lot of people calling it THE COMEDY OF THE SEASON!!!! A show so stupid that it probably took more effort the dumb down the show to its current level than to write a coherent story. An \"intentionally unintentional comedy\" or some shit. And I somewhat agree. Except...\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, Mayoiga is the comedy of the season, thank you very much.\\n\\n\r\nSecond of all, I think being an intentional unintentional comedy really depends on one's viewing habits of the show. \\n\\n\r\nMayoiga became so dumb so fast that I started watching FOR the dumbness. I watched it so that I could laugh at it with my friend. It has a bunch of themes sure, but the execution of the themes coincide with what made the show bad (theme of distrust among strangers = extremely stupid character decisions that never fail to bring a smirk to my ever emotionless face). So really, the themes were part of the unintentional comedy all along.\\n\\n\r\nBig Order isn't really like that... it has a bunch of themes that are just... there. Again, I really don't remember EXACTLY what the hell was in this pile of dung beetle food.\\n\\n\r\nI'll need to think of a theme... hmm...\\n\\n\r\nOh here's one I guess, the theme of obedience. Obey the order! Absolute authority over something! If you're abusing your power for the \"right cause,\" is it justified?\\n\\n\r\nThe main character's power lets him do just that: have absolute control over those within an area around him. They could have done some amazing psychological stuff with this power, and well... they really don't.\\n\\n\r\nSome of it is used solely for comedy, like the Yuno reskin trying to find a way around this power, only to fail miserably. Some of it is used for forced drama, like when some character conveniently has a way around the power, only to result in more bullshit plot points. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and can we also mention how the civilians have like no mind of their own? They are literally just one character copy and pasted a few dozen times. They all think the same, none of them have any sort of subtlety or doubt, and they just follow what some other character is thinking. One character thinks the main character must die, so do the civilians! One character thinks that the main character is worth forgiving, so do the civilians! It's like I'm watching some monty python or something.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I don't want to wrack my brain about this show too long. I can already feel the cancer cells eating away at my temporal lobe. \\n\\n\r\nSee you guys on the other side ;-;\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Hello, are you the one who ordered the Big Order of dog shit?\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm just going to skip the foreplay and get my opinion out of the way: yes, Big Order is shit. The anime community and their family members who only know about Japanese cartoons through the posters on the wall have already declared it as shit from the moment the first episode aired, and the series quickly became known as one of the worst anime of all-time around the episode when a nuclear bomb was halted by a teenager boy's open palm. And whilst I never really care about popular word because I am a lonely hermit who refuses to join in \"best girl\" conversations forfear of catching AIDS (Anime Is Da Shit), trying to defend Big Order is like trying to defend Bill Cosby. No matter what side you're on or what result comes out of this trail, the fact remains that the subject in question isn't going to win. Although Big Order did get licensed by Crunchyroll for a DVD release, so maybe that analogy is weaker than I already thought it was.\\n\\n\r\nNot quite sure where this show's massive hate base came from - at least, not compared to every other boring, inconsequential, and downright awful anime of which we get at least ten of every season - but I will say that if the parents in The Monkey's Paw had actually seen their kid, he'd probably look like a visual representation of this series' technicals. For starters, whenever something titillating happens in this show, there's always a bright flash of light that makes it look the images had been caught on fire prior to airing and the production team decided to just air it anyways because they made a deal with Satan and he's very stingy regarding when he wants his animu. Apparently, Satan isn't so stingy regarding whether he can actually see the underage boobage or what's actually happening in general, because the fire engulfed like 90% of the frames whenever a scene happens in order to make pre-pubescent boys experience their first erection, and since Big Order is a schlock anime, you're going to be seeing quite a bit of damaged footage by the time it finishes. You'll also notice watching the show that the violent images in this series were reportedly evacuated from the fire before it got too big, but because they're directed with about as much enthusiasm as a USA police officer has for a black person's safety and animated with a budget of three nickels, I speak no hyperbole when I say that a bunch of stick figures duking it out would have been more exciting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a lot has already been said about the sound mixing and choice of music, which is so utterly mismatched regarding what's going on that you could have put on one of those never-ending loop videos featuring a Rick Astley song and it would have blended in just as well. I wasn't really paying attention to it because the show aired on the same day as four other anime I kept up with and I mostly played video games when going through the boring half of that output just to keep myself from falling asleep, but the fact that I can't remember a single tune doesn't speak well for the composer of that shit. But of course, what else can you expect from asread? You know asread, right? The guys who gave us Shuffle, and then gave us Shuffle again? Can you imagine the censorship in that show if aired today? Depending on who you are, you'll either get more pissed off at the series than you already are now or laugh like a hyena because your mind has broken to the point that you can't imagine what you're watching.\\n\\n\r\nBut even if you did put yourself into the mindset of the four or five complete freaks who will always like your horrible product and accept the horrendous production, you still have to deal with the story and characters - or lack thereof because this show's handling of them is so poor that it makes Angel Beats look like Six Feet Under. The plot is focused on a young middle-school kid named Eiji, a kid who screams \"I want to be Lelouch\" so much that he might as well have had the costume included with his summoning of the Jojo/Ajin stands that represent the superpowers in this show and give him the ability to control people. He was apparently responsible for destroying the world in his youth in order to protect his younger dying sister, and due to the terror caused by that incident, he isolates himself from the rest of the world with only some mysterious girl who's name I can't remember due to how little importance she actually had to keep him company. One day however, another mysterious girl named Rin transfers to his classroom, intent on taking revenge for her family due to them being a casualty of Eiji's crime, only to be put under his control and turned into his masochistic love slave thanks to her immortality. However, with her comes a giant organization intent on exploiting Eiji's powers for their own gain, and Eiji ends up awakening to his potential as an Order user in order to deal with all that happening in his life, keep his sister happy, and save/destroy the world. What follows is what I can only describe as the writers of this show throwing out a ton of toys from their Geass/Evangelion-ripoff box and seeing which one sticks.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really appalling just how much happens in this show and yet not a single thing that does is engaging because of the show's utter disregard for context. There's a lot of plot, but there's so little story behind it to the point that it feels like an abridged series without the dubbing. Eiji himself is pretty bland as a lead character, only being defined by what the plot tells him to do and nothing else when it takes a break. The only thing close to an engaging hook is the questions brought up regarding whether you'd save or destroy the world if you had the power to do so, but Big Order never expounds on the philosophies the characters have towards this theme with anything more than either a token \"well that's how they feel\" or because \"I'm an anime character\", which is about as tacked on a reason as you can get short of \"because I'm in a porno\". And speaking of being an anime character, it's really hard to take anyone seriously because they all look like rejected cosplay competitors, they're all lame anime stereotypes whose humor blends poorly with the setting, and all the girls and one or two guys fall for our bland male character's cock to the point that they don't mind actually getting pregnant from him. Oh and yes, that pregnant or not pregnant bunny girl looks a lot like Rei Ayanami. Because you can't be a post-90s anime if you're not ripping off Evangelion (and you can't be a post-2012 anime if you're not ripping off Jojo).\\n\\n\r\nI strongly advise not trying to connect everything that happens on your first watch, because there are some things in life that the human mind just isn't made to comprehend. The best I can summarize it is that there's this organization that opposes the one that wants to use Eiji, his father is the true reason behind the world's destruction, his sister is incredibly vital to the plan, there's a bunch of crazy men, there's a bunch of even crazier ladies, and not a single thing I just spoiled matters because the ending shits over everything that happened prior in a way that I won't go into, but let's just say I didn't make that Eiji: The Harem King joke earlier lightly. Oh, and there's incest. According to manga fans, the incest is something the anime added because\u2026there is no justification to add incest. It's incest. It's fucking disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nBut then again, I guess that's why it was included in the first place. Because one thing I've learned from watching Evangelion clone after Evangelion clone is that they always focus on the more disturbing parts of that series and never on, y'know, the reason why those disturbing parts worked in the first place? And Big Order definitely does not break that mold, what with its prepubescent sex, violent usage of superpowers, and of course, the nuclear missile I mentioned earlier. Of course, Devadasy at least had some balls in regards to its pretentious imagery. For all of Big Order's claims to be edgy trash, it never goes far enough with that adjective and just ends up being plain trash. None of that prepubescent sex I mentioned leads to anything interesting let alone actual penetration, and the violence is hard to take seriously when it's executed like a Xebec production. You know Xebec, right? The guys responsible for Argevollen and Tokyo ESP? Why yes, I did remind you those shows existed, and now you want to kill me for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only positive I really have for Big Order is that the monochrome effect used to indicate a different dimension in the final episode was alright. Other than that though, Big Order is a classic victim of being birthed from a lack of imagination and teeth, unable to make what it rips off its own and suffering massively for it. I wouldn't join its massive hate base in calling it one of the worst anime of all-time, but I also wouldn't recommend it even if you're a trash-lover. Most of the trash anime this year alone at least had good animation and visual direction that could carry you if you just mute the screen and turn off the subtitles. The only way Big Order would look good to you is if you wore sunglasses and then poured acid all over your eyes.",

And sometimes, we come across shows that are so offensively awful that we sit down and wonder what was even the point, or shows that are so blatantly offensive that we have no clue why would anyone in their right-mind derive any kind of enjoyment from them.\r\nBefore moving further, I need to stress out something; if you liked Mirai Nikki, then that does not necessarily mean you will like this show. I am no fan of Mirai Nikki, but for what its worth, itwas at least colorful and entertaining enough to watch all the way to the end.\\n\r\nAlso, if you were looking for a quick answer as to whether or not a show is worth watching, here's one; this is only worth watching for all the wrong reasons, aka the so bad it's good rule.\\n\\n\r\nBig Order isn't colorful, but it certainly is entertaining for a wide variety of reasons.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, the story is complete and utter garbage. I've never seen a story constantly break rules literally minutes after making them, then make even more rules to attempt to cover that up...and fail miserably. Not only that, but the characters' actions in comparison to what is actually going on makes no sense the more you think about it; this story more or less reeks of the feeling that the \"writer\" was making up the story as she rolled with it rather than any particular thought that was put into the \"script\".\\n\\n\r\nOh, and let us not forget the dialogue. It largely consists of our main character screaming \"SENA\" and Sena screaming \"EIJI\" or more infamously \"ONII-CHAN\" (in a manner that would put most hentai doujins to shame), as well as its various dumb attempts at drama.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of drama, have I mentioned how absolutely retarded some of these character powers are? A girl that gets pregnant if a guy touches her? The main character basically having what feels like the combination of the Geass power from Code Geass and a Stand from Jojo without half the thought that went into either? The main pseudo-heroine (and I refer to her a pseudo-heroine because the main heroine is clearly SENAAAAAAAAAAAA) being immortal? The list goes on and on, but to put it simply; these powers feel like they were slapped together without the slightest shred of thought as to how they would affect the immersion of the story. But no power is as immersion breaking as Eiji's ability to control territory; seriously, this power is so broken that it ruins all immersion that the story would have because there's no feeling of tension, since we, the viewers, always know that he'll come out on top.\\n\\n\r\nThat, and its dumb excuse of...nationalism? Seriously, why would a council of totally generic villains want to control the world again? \\n\\n\r\nThematically speaking, this show is broken...because I actually have no point what it's about, even after all is said and done. The script takes influence from a lot of works like I said earlier, ranging from Code Geass to Jojo to Evangelion to elements from the writer's earlier work, Mirai Nikki. But NOTHING works; at some point we have the nationalist themes from Code Geass, then another where it has Stands like Jojo, and then the last bits of the show go full-on End of Evangelion on everyone for no reason. COPYING AND PASTING PARTS OF SCRIPTS FROM OTHER WORKS DOES NOT WORK.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are horrible. I'm referring to each and every single last one of them, by the way; at least in Mirai Nikki the entire cast was colorful, if exaggerated to hell and back, and I even had a couple of characters I liked. Here? Not a single one. That being said, they're all entertaining to watch...because they're all bloody idiots. Eiji could've probably won the entire time if certain circumstances and information was given to him at the beginning, and the fact he WASN'T given said information makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nNotYuno (I can't even remember her name, she's that irrelevant) is basically Yuno, only not as entertainingly crazy and more of the entertainingly random, if only because her characterization makes no sense and she acts like an idiot who also happens to like the guy who might've murdered everyone and caused an apocalypse only to seduce him on numerous occasions then go yandere then go back again and...do you see where I'm going with this?\\n\\n\r\nSena is...well, discussing her would spoil the whole show, but I only have two words: Onii-chan.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is more or less the same style as Mirai Nikki, which is OK I guess. What is not OK is the absolutely atrocious animation quality, which has absolutely horrid use of CGI throughout the show, lots of still frames and repeated shots, little to no movement for most of the show and incredibly annoying looking dark shading that feels like the whole show is trying to be darker than it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is equally horrible, voice-acting is bad, and all in all, I do not recommend this show...\\n\\n\r\n...But wait, I do. I recommend this show. This show is entertainingly bad in ways that I didn't think humanly possible. It's the very definition of...well, not a trainwreck, since you actually need to have a train moving properly to go wrong. This is complete and utter chaos, and the sheer combination of all of said elements make for an incredibly entertaining watch, especially if with friends or drunk...though the sheer awfulness of this show may straight up make you want to kill yourself if you get depressed while drinking. Actually, maybe just skip the drinking part, I don't want blood on my hands.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else? Stay as far away as humanly possible.",

            "content": "Let\u2019s talk about Big Order.\r\nBig Order is known as one of the biggest trainwreck in the history of japanese animation. The insanity and sheer stupidity of the show has now become legendary and it\u2019s the only reason I decided to watch the show. \r\nNow, if you only watch the first episode, you\u2019re probably gonna think it\u2019s just another bland, poorly written anime like many other anime and you would be so wrong. The true nature of Big Order only shows his ugly head after the first episode and after that, it never tries to hide it again. This show has the most nonsensical story Ihave ever witness\u00a0; even manga like Riki-Oh can\u2019t compete with Big Order. It\u2019s so stupid and his constant need to contradict itself every two seconds with the dumbest thing ever actually  made me believe that Big Order is a parody. It has to be. No show can be that stupid and not doing it on purpose.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start by talking about Eiji, the main character. He represents very well the experience that is Big Order: he is simply the worst in every way. First, he is seriously the real vilain of the story to the point where he actually fights to destroy a world where everyone could be happy. And don\u2019t get your hopes up people, the serie and the rest of the cast still treat him like a hero, even if he is the complete opposite of it. But what make Eiji really special it\u2019s how he literally makes no sense at all as a character\u00a0: he is, at the same time, a wannabe rapist, shy in love, a guy who want to save the world, a guy who don\u2019t care about he world, an idiot who don\u2019t understand anything, a smart guy who understand everything, a nice guy who saves people, an asshole who tortures people, someone who wants to protect his sister, someone who his r*aping his underrage sister (yes), someone who wants to create a perfect world for his sister except when he has the actual opportunity to do it\u2026 And no I am not making any of this stuff up, he really is all over the place and make no sense at all, like the overall crapfest that is BO.\\n\r\nAlso he is one of the hateful MC I have seen in while\u00a0: not only he is a r*apist (and no cares about it of course) but he screams \u00ab\u00a0Senna\u00a0\u00bb at least 20 times per episode like the whiny bitch he is, to the point that even Snow from FF XIII would ask him to shut it. You can stab him, cut his arms or legs, Eiji will still be screaming \u00ab\u00a0Senna\u00a0\u00bb over and over... And poor Morita who had to voice such an awful twat\u2026 And by the way, even his powers don\u2019t make sense\u00a0: sometimes he is overpowered and sometimes he is not. No explanation is EVER given of course because that\u2019s how Big Order rule\u00a0: logic is for the weak, only insanity and stupidity are needed.\\n\\n\r\nReally, the show is all over the place, makes no sense in the slighest and love to forgot things it just introduce. For example, out of nowhere, we have actual gods who show up but don\u2019t worry our dear Eiji doesn\u2019t even care to see them (he actually ignore them even if they are the one who can actually save his sister) and then 5 minutes after, the gods disappears completely from the story with no explanation. Classic Big Order\u00a0! Oh you want more\u00a0? Well, the show introduce Rei Ayan- I mean Iyo, a girl with a red ribbon. Eiji touchs her ribbon and she become instantly pregnant\u00a0: she cries but Eiji promise that he will take responsability. Five minutes after, Iyo is gonna give birth to the baby except after that, the plot completely forgot about the existence of the said baby. Iyo is suddenly no more pregnant anymore and except for three throwaway lines that don\u2019t explain ANYTHING, the baby like the gods disappears completely from the story. Again, I\u2019m not making any of this stuff up\u00a0: now you know why Big Order is know for being an absolute trainwreck. Because it is one. And I could continue for hours like since the makers of this masterpiece made sure that absolutely nothing made any kind sense in this show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the rest of the cast\u00a0I hear you ask? Hahahahaha, fools\u00a0! If I can give Big Order one thing is that the show is consistent\u00a0: the \u00ab\u00a0cast\u00a0\u00bb is as bad as the rest of the show.\\n\r\nWe have Rin, who is basically a parody of Yuno from Mirrai Nikki. She has a decent backstory but the story take a massive dump on her everytime it can\u00a0: she gets her ass kicked constantly and is one of the biggest idiot of the show which is an statement someone cannot make lightly. She wants to kill the man responsible for the death of her parents except when she doesn\u2019t want or forgets about it. Her relationship with the MC, our dear rapist Eiji\u00a0? Simple my friend\u00a0: She hates him  because she think he killed her parents okay, but wait no she actually likes him now for no reason but no back to hating him oh no she is loving him again\u2026 Again no explanation for this behavior.\\n\r\nThen, we have Senna, the sister of Eiji. While they are not blood related, she is, like her BIG BRO, an awful character who manage to be even more digusting than Eiji, which is a feat really. She is a naive girl, except when she is evil but sometimes she is nice\u2026 You know the drill by now, she also doesn\u2019t make a lick of sense. The only thing she is consistant about is f*cking her brother and I don\u2019t get why anyone would want save her. \\n\r\nThe show also introduce the Ten, a group of powerful orders (people with powers) and they seem to be very important for the plot. Except they aren\u2019t. Only Iyo, Rin and White Hair matters. We kinda get to know three others, Glasses Girl, Rip-Komamura-Off and Fran but they barely do anything for the plot which is kinda sad since Fran is the only character of the all show who seem to be a decent guy. The rest I hear you ask\u00a0? Well, nothing. While two of them have interesting design, I can\u2019t even call them characters. They will show up at random, at best throw two or three meaningless lines that changes nothing and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a shame because I really wanted to see more of \u00ab\u00a0Big Wood\u00a0\u00bb and sadly, he doesn\u2019t even speak. And Big Order loves do that by the way\u00a0: they introduce many, MANY characters but refuse to do anything with them and ultimately, forget about them completely. Some were clearly created for the BIG fan service moment in episode 5 (5 to 10 minutes devoted to a woman harrassing others women in a bath, fantastic) but the others\u00a0? I don\u2019t know. They created at least 15 characters who have no purpose, probably because the makers of this shitstorm are insane.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Big Ordeaaaah is a parody. It has to be. Not just because I refuse to live in a world where this shitshow was made legit but also because I quickly checked the manga. And yes, the manga seem to be way less stupid\u00a0: Eiji is no more a wannabe rapist and there is no incest-pedo relationship with his sister. Now, I haven\u2019t read that much and yes, the manga doesn\u2019t seem to be good either but it doesn\u2019t look as awful as the anime. So my guess is that the anime was made terrible on purpose for some reason. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m giving a 5\u00a0: because when you accept that Big Order is a Big Joke, it\u2019s kinda fun. I actually laugh a couple of time while watching it (the ending of episode 2 was fantastic) and it\u2019s almost a \u00ab\u00a0so bad it\u2019s good\u00bb anime.. It\u2019s a trainwreck, a shitfest that deserve a watch if you\u2019re into that kind of stuff\u00a0: it has to be seen in order (hahaha) to be believed. However, unlike masterpieces like Samurai Cop or Miami Connection , Big Order is still annoying a lot of the time: I mean watching a show with a plot that make no sense but act like it does, filled with awful, unlikeable characters with mediocre fights scenes is not easy. Ah yes , I almost forgot to tell, there is barely any fight scenes in this anime and all of them are mediocre anyway (because of poor animation). Some characters have interesting powers but of course, they barely use it at all.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the OST is good. Even if they love to place some songs at inappropriate times. Because of course they do, that\u2019s the way of Big Order.",

            "content": "Have you ever wondered why you aren't happy in the universe you are living in? It's probably because somewhere deep down in your subconscious you know this anime exists. I can only wonder what type of madness or psychotic affliction plauged the creators of this show when they made it. Now before I continue ranting on how bad this show is, allow me to break it into the specific categories.\r\nSTORY: Now let me tell you, this section shouldn't exist. The creators of the show created a world where there logically shouldn't be a story. The characters have all the tools at there disposals to instantlysolve any problem they are faced with, but they don't. The creators had to suck all intelligence away from a large majority of the characters just to make sure that they didn't break the universe and achieve their goals during episode 1-2. In fact I would like you to play a game while watching Big Order. Count all the ways that the main characters sister could be healed but isn't. Let's see if you can keep the number under five. The story doesn't make any sense, and logic and reasoning are sacrificed in (Big) order to keep the story going. There is some enjoyment to be had however, to watch the fallacies unfold while the show takes itself very very seriously. It's quite bizzare how the show thinks it is being clever and smart but in reality it just makes he viewer want to bang their head against a wall because of how dumb everything is. Also something I noticed is the show gets less and less intelligent the farther into it you watch. By the time you reach the last episode the show just unloads a large pile of nonsense on the viewer, but the main character is crying and yelling so I guess they were trying to have it by climactic, but in reality it was the largest pile of nonsense I have ever seen on screen.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Hoshimya Eiji is the main character and one of the most powerful characters I have ever seen in any form of media...he is also one of the least intelligent so it balances out. This character is a high level reality warper and his powers extend to being able to manipulate people, and yet he still finds himself being manipulated and controlled by the people under his control. He is also a selfish asshole, and after completing the show, has me convinced that he is the main antagonist while the supposed \"villians\" of the show are actually the good guys. Eiji is the type of character who would actively fight against every one to ever exist receiving eternal happiness, and the turn around and achieve that for himself while the rest of humanity continues to suffer. But it's okay because he cries and screams alot so that means that he is a deep and interesting character...right?\\n\\n\r\nHoshimya Sena is Eiji's useless sister and his love interest. If you haven't built up a resistance to incest in your entertainment after Game of Thrones, this anime (alone wih 50% of other animes) will help you achieve that goal. Creepy love interest aside, she is Eiji's sister and definitely got the dominant Dumb gene just like her brother, only she has a healthy dose of crippling illness that is supposed to make me want to sympathise with her, but in reality I wish she had died the first time she got stabbed. Really the only reason I am even talking about her is because she is a key component in one of the shows least intelligent moments, and that is saying alot because this show is filled to the brim with dumb moments. There is nothing redeemable about this character even though the show tries to make her a very deep character.\\n\\n\r\nIyo is the best character in the show and one of the best characters ever made in any anime ever. I heavily encourage you to watch this show just until you learn what is special and her rabbit ears. It is bound to have you die from laughter because it is one of the most silly concepts ever invented and yet is executed in a very serious and non comedic manner, which successfully amplifies the hilarity.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : As a masochist I love watching bad anime in (big) order to make fun of them. Big Order is a great anime to watch for this purpose. It will make you wonder what type of mental disease the person who had this show pitched to them and still decided to throw their money at it. Things happen in this show that don't need to because anyone wih half a brain could have solved the issue three episodes ago. Don't get me wrong this show is terrible. Like Mahouka terrible. But it is one the best comedies to come out this year. You should watch it just to have your mind go numb from trying to figure the show out. Unless you aren't into intentionally putting yourself through torturous situations because you enjoy the tingly feeling of pain roiling throughout every cell of your body until it makes you want to scream in ecstasy ... and if that's the case, I guess to each their own.\\n",

            "content": "There is a lot bad things being said about Big Order anime, and while many of them are true, I believe it's hated more than it deserves. Why? I'll try to explain it in this review!\r\nStory:\r\nWeakest and, in a way, strongest point of Big Order. First of all, take a look at the genre: action shounen. It's not another Mirai Nikki, and while synopsis and even first episode kinda sell it as something more psychological, it is not. It's action anime and if you expect anything more, you will be seriously disappointed.\r\nSaying it's rushed would be a huge understatement. Things happen too fast with toofew explanations, leading to plot holes, illogical developments and deus ex machina solutions.\\n\r\nOn the other hand it's interesting and unique. The story managed to keep me interested through whole anime and some twists even surprised me - and I don't mean unpredictable ones caused by the lack of explanations earlier in the story. Conflict, while chaotic and, again, lacking deeper explanation, makes one wonder who is right. By the last episode I wasn't sure if protagonist is doing the right thing - that is a huge plus for me.\\n\r\nIn the end I believe all the shortcomings of the story are coming down to time and pacing. If this anime had 26 episodes and everything was explained and developed before progressing further, I'm sure we'd be talking totally differently about Big Order now.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nWhen it comes to graphics, Big Order is doing fine. Nothing special - it just looks good, with some better and worse moments. Though big minus for censored bath episode!\\n\r\nNow, sound is where it gets good. Music is nice, sure, but what's more important is using it during episodes. So often all the msuic in anime is limited to OP and ED, I just can't ignore when music starts playing in middle of episode! While it could be played more often and we could also use more variety, it's still very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSimilar situation to what I wrote about story - not enough time, not enough development, not enough explaining. Yes, they are interesting. Damn, I'd even say they were great characters, especially Rin with her yandere/tsundere mix, but with how rushed everything was, I can only say \"wasted potential\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI'm not sure how I would feel if I watched it while airing, but doing it my usual way - by watching all at once - I wasn't bored even for one second, which for me qualifies it as an enjoyable anime. It might not be some piece of art, but it serves its purpose of burning free time perfectly and ends in a way that leaves watcher satisfied.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am but a mere man. I am not worthy of experiencing such greatness, but our lord and savior Mirai Nikki's Author is a merciful god. He hath brought upon us Big Order, a masterpiece that must be witnessed by all.\r\nThe story topples even the greatest of literary works. William Shakesphere and Mark Train wish they'd live to see this anime. It is about a young man named Edgy Yukiteru, who wishes to conquer the world after obtaining a Stand that allows him to control anything within an uncertain area. See how mighty Edgy is as his powers let him break out of any situationthat is most convenient for the plot! Crucial plot elements like \"drama\" and \"tension\" shalt not exist in this grand adventure, for they are mere illusions created by humans. Big Order transcends our reality and is above such trivial things, and the great god Edgy cannot hope to be harmed by anything due to his awesome power.\\n\\n\r\nBut, alas! Harsh trials await our dear Edgy, as he doesn't use his power in the most effective ways. Is it because he lacks intelligence? Heavens, no! One must not underestimate this seraph, for he is merely toying with his enemies and giving them the faintest chance of victory, allowing the intricate narrative to play its part. Such mighty foes lurk in the dark, with power over nuclear weapons and innocent hostages. Such cruelty! But that's not all! The entire world foolishly misunderstands Edgy's celestial presence as they blame him for the deaths of billions of people. With this, we are given an extraordinarily realistic representation of real people; it's as if the show were actually filmed live from a rally of the glorious Donald Trump! And even Edgy's friends are mysterious characters as he peacefully neglects to control them by force. Is there anyone he can trust!?\\n\\n\r\nYea, Edgy does indeed have a loyal follower, his lone younger sister. A pure and innocent being, she plays a key role in the story as the motivation and love interest of our hero, for his order is dedicated to only her. Such a human relationship, it's as if the show were actually filmed live from a rally of the glorious Donald Trump! The adoration of his blessed imouto fills him with determination and motivates the audience to cheer on their beloved icon even more!\\n\\n\r\nSee the intensity of the challenging duels between Order Users as they clash together; their gorgeous avatars dazzle the eyes of the audience, but only for a short time. While these battles appear to only last moments with few actions taking place, it is merely a sample of what lies hidden away. Our sinful beings are not worthy of witnessing the true battles of the gods, and such we are limited to quick brawls with ordinary tactics and simple abilities. Be grateful for what you have, mortal.\\n\\n\r\nTruly, no words can describe some of the bold details of the writing; I cannot name specifics, for that would be spoiling and therefore tarnishing the mystical plot, but you cannot prepare thy rear enough for them! Big Order is a shocking and surprising series with amazing dialogue and entertainingly absurd ideas that are sure to boggle your mind. When one thinks they know the secrets and intricate details of the world, they are greeted with new, astonishing discoveries. Such is the truth with Big Order.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is nothing short of brilliant. Edgy is truly an hero whose intellect and manliness is unmatched, as is depicted with the impregnation of Rei. His personality is locked away from all others--including us, the lesser audience. His lack of characteristics truly make him the perfect being. His short-lived accomplice, Yuno Gasai, is a murderous wench who seeks to destroy Edgy, but her attempts always end in failure, providing us with amusement. Only in Big Order shall you see menacing villains turned into comical relief! And the saintly Rei Ayanami is but an innocent wanderer in the story, but witnesses the excellence that is Edgy Yukiteru, and pledges loyalty to him for all eternity for small, simple reasons. May we all follow her example, for we too have small, simple reasons for our lives.\\n\\n\r\nAppropriately, Big Order is depicted through art that surpasses the fine works of Michael Angelo, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bob Ross, and so on. The holy Stands are gorgeously portrayed by fine computer-generated animation reminiscent of the year 2003, a golden age when shrubbery was leading a great country and Nickelodeon broadcasted amusing content. After all, if we are to go forward, we must go back. Studio Assread has once again proven to be the future of the anime industry. And no other anime has such breathtaking and unique character designs like Big Order does; they are masterfully crafted and gorgeous to watch. Some say they are \u201cfanservice-y\u201d, but that is merely a sin they have brought upon themselves for thinking such dirty things. It\u2019s only natural for a lady with rock powers to have rock-hard nipples, and it is your duty to respect that. Shame on you. It\u2019s no wonder why many viewers have reported sights of an Ultralight Beam covering much of their filthy screens; it is only visible to the eyes of sinners to prevent them from further descension. Should you repent, you may one day become capable of viewing the mature content like a responsible adult.\\n\\n\r\nAh, the great sounds of jazz! An elegant series such as this has but the most charming of music pieces to accompany it. No matter the scene or situation, the power of brass trumpets and saxophones will sound triumphantly. The opening theme, performed by none other than the esteemed Babymetal, is an explosive tune that is sure to rock the audience, and the ending credits is a haunting, hallowing experience that leaves you craving another episode. But they cannot compare to the greatness of the jazzy soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\n...Oh, dear reader. How have you managed to read this much without rushing over to HorribleSubs to legally view this sanctifying experience!? Run along, my friend! Tell your friends and family about the good news, salvation is here! We have truly found perfection, and it is none other than the ten episodes of Big Order!",

            "content": "Big Order is by far one of the most badly written shows I have seen in a very long time. The narrative resembles more so a comedy script or a parody of shows, except that the anime is trying to be serious and not trying to create any satire what so ever. While there were many parts of the anime I would put into the \"so bad it's good bin\" by the end, the narrative became even more of a convoluted mess and all fun I had with the series quickly diminished. Hell, when I saw the announcement for this show, I initially thought itwas going to be a slice of life show about working in the fast food industry or some shit, since I knew nothing about it before hand, but what we got was in fact, far worse than that. After learning that in fact it was the same author as Mirai Nikki, I understood why it was such a big mess but I think this is far worse than Mirai Nikki in terms of writing, normally an author gets better over time, not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nHell, near enough all the characters look exactly like Mirai Nikki characters, especially the new girl to replace Yuno Gasi and this problem is even worse in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is perhaps the most stupid thing I have ever seen. It starts off with an extremely vague flying chick who goes around granting wishes to people and after asking the main character about one hundred fucking times he replies by saying he wants to destroy the world, being largely influenced by his favorite cartoon...the world was destroyed by a FUCKING cartoon. Anyway, we cut ten years into the future (because fuck continuity) were we see the world has not been destroyed and even after a massive calamity, society seems to have progressed enough to build another school. Like, what the fuck. I certainly haven't lived through a disaster like the world being destroyed but I highly doubt a school or sometimes whole cities would still be running, but hey, who gives a fuck. It also turns out that the fairy woman thing was granting wishes to many other people giving them powers to make their wishes come true and these people are referred to as 'orders' and are hated by the general public.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if Daisy was granting random wishes to people, then why on earth didn't anyone wish for the world to be fixed or something? Was Eiji the last person she ever granted a wish to? Anyway, Eiji is our main character who pissed me off straight away from his introduction. He is an edgy as fuck teenager and the world hates him, while also having a rather intimate relationship with his sister. Why? I don't fucking know, incest is going to be in every shitty show now? And it's not like it's subtle either, they literally have sex with each other and everything. While on his way home from school he is attacked by a Yuno clone (minus everything that made Yuno a fun character). She vows vengeance on Eiji since his wish caused the great destruction which killed her parents. During this fight, he showcases his power which literally looks like a poor man's version of a stand from JoJo. In fact, every power is literally a JoJo stand except they're all CG and look like shit and none of the powers are ever developed or explained. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Eiji can control things within his 'domain' and manipulate things within that space to do whatever he says...so not only is this show like JoJo, it's also like Code Geass, he even wants to take over the world in the name of peace like Lelouch. While Yuno-clone is in this domain, she is unable to kill Eiji but over the course of the show begins to fall in love with him which is the dumbest thing I've ever heard because he kinda says that he will marry her or something...this makes no fucking sense.\\n\\n\r\nAfter deciding to take over the world for the sake of world peace and to protect his sister and is made king of some kind of organisation or whatever... I don't fucking care anymore. Why should I care when the anime gives me no reason to. We're introduced to all these characters who are supposedly the strongest but they barely have any screen time and pretty much are useless\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is all over the god damn place and nothing makes any sense what so ever. Things happen at random, all of the characters are stupid beyond belief. We rush through the plot at break neck speed never allowing for any plot or character development at all. No character is likeable in the slightest and no one is ever developed. For a while, the show could be pretty entertaining since it was so bad it was good. Such as in episode 4 when a nuke is dropped right above Eiji's head and he stops it his bare hands. Wouldn't it explode? Why didn't the people aim the nuke a few miles away from their location to ensure that it can't be stopped? Who fucking cares.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tries way too hard to be edgy featuring plenty of leg and arm amputations and some of the worst censoring I have seen in a long time for any kind of nudity. Don't you love scenes that are 90% white light? \\n\\n\r\nThere were some parts that were just fucking dumb. Like the one scene in which Eiji touches the ears of the Miko character and she becomes pregnant. What the fuck.\\n\\n\r\nThe powers are never explained and lack any originality. The characters are boring and badly written, there is crappy animation and bad CGI, dull script, extremely forced plot twists that make no sense near the end and combining that with one of the worst endings I have ever seen makes for one of the worst anime of this year.",

            "content": "Before I begin my review, let me get it off my chest and say that I am not one of those elite posers or trolls who is quick to hop on the bandwagon and immediately dislike the show because the original creator was Sakae Esuno, the original artist and author of Mirai Nikki or Future Dairy (whichever you prefer.) \r\nLet me start with this, between Future Diary and Big order, with this series it's like characters that didn't make it into The future diary got their own spin-off thus Big order was born. Just watching the first episode, the  similarities with the characters andto a certain degree the story are of course obvious. Certain characters resemble, and to a certain extent act/behave almost the way characters in Future Diary did. In all honesty, it's like he made the same story twice but (Obviously) tweaked little things in the story, plot, etc to try to give Big order its own unique individuality. For the most part I think that it works out pretty well. I'm not saying that Sakae is a bad writer, it's just that he needs to do a better job with making better distinctions with each of his works, that way it doesn't feel like the two shows are blending into each other. Unless of course he's doing this to make it seem like they take place in the same sort of universe however... we all (most of us) know how the universes in Future Dairy work out.. cough cough.  That aside, I could not establish any type of commitment to the story [for the most part.] I will certainly say that it is not Esuno's best work however, I am roughly around 86.7% convinced that he can do a better job with creating an engaging and intensely dramatic story-line [along with plot] that's not only fun to watch but also really keeps viewers like me satisfied and engaged with what's going on. To me it seems like he purposely adds, or \"tries too hard\" to keep his work \"dark\" while trying to add fear into the factor and it just wasn't working for me. I mean, [and I'm going to try to stop bringing up the future dairy because again this is a different work] with the future dairy I was very satisfied with The story & plot. It was full of drama and the studio, producers, and director did a great job of adding mystery and a bit of action parts to the story. Which kept me engaged for a majority of the time.  \\n\r\nBig order really felt like (and I hate to use this word) but laziness, pure laziness. Now things did pick up for me after episode 5. To me, this is the point where the show finally start getting somewhat serious in both dialogue and starting drama. I cannot spoil anything but I loved the intense amount of dramatic battles, fights between Eiji and his squad. I was glad that things started to pick up in Big order. Because there are only 10 episodes, if things didn't pick up around episode 5-6 I probably would've lost interest and dropped it. Il would probably had stuck to my guns and watched it anyway simply because once I start a show I make a commitment to see it through. Overall, I felt like dialogue between characters was dull, action scenes didn't really land a spark and it lacked an engaging story-line along with plot. I gave the 6.5 outta 10 because I didn't feel like Sakae had used his full potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, special effects, and CGI used during the show were pretty good however nothing major stands out too much to me. When I'm watching battle scenes I often times felt like it was missing a certain charm.  Perhaps they lacked intensity & replay value.  I was expecting, \"unless of course I missed some\" Easter eggs or references of the future dairy, I mean I saw the ball that Kami-Musubi had looked like the same one Tsubaki in Future dairy owned however, as far as I saw, that is the limit to how far Easter eggs go. Now character designs, the resemblances, I felt like at the very least the producers could have at least adjusted Eiji, Tairano, Daisy, Rin, and so many other characters original designs to look much different. This is because they stand out too much and look like the future dairy cast. They appear as cheesy, uninspired rip offs.  Sakae shouldn't draw Yukiteru and make him look more mature and call him \"Eiji.\" He shouldn't draw  Yuno make her look like a dolled up idol star and call her \"Daisy.\" More importantly he should not! and I mean should not! have taken Yuno's infamous \"Yandere archetype\" and Minene's cold, tough girl attitude and gave it to Kurenai I just think that lacks a bit of creativity. Overall, despite all of this I'm still satisfied with the final results.\\n\\n\r\nI disliked all the characters. I don't know how much I can go into so I'll just put it bluntly. Big order has the most dullest, and lackluster characters I have seen in some time. Each character lacked their own unique individuality. As I mentioned many times before, the characters, for the most part are just copy and pasted from Mirai Nikki albeit with some changes. Character growth and development wasn't exciting because Eiji literally has an OP gift \"order.\" Although he does have this power he is often times beaten by other important characters but of course he cannot lose because you know, he's the main character. If I had to change anything from Esuno's work,  I would make characters more appealing in terms of personality, uniqueness and how they appeal to the viewers. Creativity and most importantly memorable characters in big order isn't possible for me because again, all I saw was laziness.  Overall I was beyond disappointed with the characters and this is the first time! This is perhaps the first and hopefully the last time I have to watch a show with a cast full of bad characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty good but no too impressive. Music is not as powerful and dramatic as the future diary soundtrack however, there are  still has a few good songs here to hear playing in the background here and there. Voice actors were pretty good so I don't have much to complain about in that department. Overall I didn't care too much about the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just say that I wasn't exactly too fond of what I watched. I'm not going to say that it was completely bad because, as I mentioned earlier, the show does deliver lots of great moments however, in the long run, I felt like it was wasted potential. Overall I think it needed a lot of work in story and especially the characters department.",

It throws you for all kinds of loops in the dumbest, more surreal ways imaginable, thinking that's it's a clever, emotional, deep, and truly thought-provoking being when in reality, it's a sloppy, horrifically told mess. Trying to really understand everything about it is to succumb to a Lovecraftian horror that will destroy your mind and soul since it actually manages to be both convoluted in all the potentially interesting and deep ways while fucking it all up and being convoluted the wrong ways. It doesn't answer all theright questions we are left with, and it sometimes answers them in ways that make things worse. Hell, it doesn't even understand the revolting implications of some of its characters actions, so how the hell can it expect to understand the major plot it has created?\\n\\n\r\nIt's actually futile to try to understand this anime since it doesn't even understand itself that well. It's like it's final antagonist, trying to delve deep into something it was never gonna truly get, making detrimentally wrong decisions, and losing sight of what it tried to do as it went and tried to one-up itself in \"craftiness\" and \"mind-bending twists\". It knows what it's trying to be, but that it's trying to be is something it cannot handle, which is truly fitting given that many of its characters suffer that exact same fate. So, just how badly did Big Order implode in on itself? Or rather, just what happened to make it suffer that fate? Well, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nBasically, 10 years ago, Eiji made a wish that ended up destroying the world, add that wish was to dominate it for world peace. Now, you're asking why didn't he say \"I want world peace\"? The thing is, it wasn't his actual wish, it was his sister's. I know I'm jumping the gun but I need to tackle this early. The flashbacks make it seem like she's a girl who can comprehend full conversations and the state of our worlds as well as empathy by then we learn she was only 3, making this make little sense since actual 3 year olds don't do any of that. I know this because the flashback specifically states 10 years ago, as well as the fact that in the final episode, she turns 14 soon after the major events of the final episode. Now, basically, the plot tries to one up itself in terms of stringing its MC along for all sorts of twists, turns, betrayals, etc., so let's tackle some of them, as well as a few other moments and see what went wrong, shall we? After all, it's hard to really describe the plot well given how wrecked it is, but we can attack it's logic and see why the story falters, in sort of a rapid fire kind of fashion, though this isn't my usual formula.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Kurenai Rin stabs Eiji's sister (Sena) in the shoulder with a sword and she bleeds horribly, you'd expect that when Eiji reaches her far more than 10 minutes later given how the episode presents itself, that she would actually be dead from blood loss. Eiji takes down two heavily armed and protected dudes by going ham with a sign (that was never shown), so yeah, that's dumb. If Rin wanted to finish off Eiji herself, she definitely shouldn't have ordered her men to riddle him with bullets (regardless of the fact that it didn't even work). When Eiji effectively puts her in his dominion, or rather, when he uses his order to block the shots before he uses his dominion order, she, for no reason, heals Sena and he never even ordered to. She wants to know why, and neither she nor we get a definite answer since we never hear him tell her to heal his sister. Barring the stuff I listed above that ultimately is explained away by the big Sena twist, this is basically all of the really crazy illogical moments from episode 1. Keep that in mind. Also at the end of the episode, Eiji uses his Order avatar to wrap Rin and given the audio and the way the episode fades to black for the credits, it basically sounds like he basically forced her into tentacle rape, and I'm not sure if they really wanted that implication or maybe they did it as a joke. Dunno.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters betray each other for no good reason. I mean, Franc betrays the group in episode 7 for no adequately explained reason only to do a face turn, only to do another heel turn in the finale. Characters also try to outsmart each other all the time, to varying and often pathetic degrees of success in terms of making any sense, like how in episode 4, one of the 10 members working for them was pretending to work for the enemy by giving the enemy heavily compromising information that jeopardizes his side's own plans to nearly getting their pawn (Eiji) killed (even though it easing their own order), or well, everything in one ginormous sequence in episode 7 that amounts to the two leaders trying to outwit each other until they are betrayed by one of their own (Rin for the bad guys and Franc for the \"good guys\", except Rin's was a part of the bad guys' plan). It's like the writer(s) decided to try to make the story one-up itself in terms of convoluted schemes of planning around plans and adding in betrayals regardless of whether or not it can be easy enough to remotely follow or if it all makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters also don't use their OP AF powers on ways that actually make good sense in their situations. There are a few notable accounts of this. Episode 3: Eiji has the Group of 10 (what a boring name) under his dominion and claims to be in control (though that's what they want), and he doesn't even do anything to bind them under his will aside from \"don't leave my domain\". If he really wanted to be in control, he should've tried to make them actually submit to his power and decisions via his dominion instead of saying \"you're in my dominion\" and expecting them to just follow him and not get him entangled in their scenes. Episode 6: A swordsman has an inter-dimensional sword that can slash between dimensions, and when he has Eiji and Iyo in his sights (as well as a now useless colleague and Kuroko (the Miko of vitality and couples in episode 6 who is gorgeous AF), he swipes vertically to kill the latter two. Even if it's revealed that Eiji needed to be alive for his father (the main antagonist), did he swordsman know that? Why not swipe vertically to kill everyone, or if he knew that he needed Eiji alive, why not depends diagonally to try to cut off a limb to make him more susceptible to capture? Episode 10: Sena Wishes dominion over the world for world peace. Even if she was basically 3 at the time, why didn't she just wish for world peace? So that the plot could happen? There had to have been better ways of making this work, like maybe trying to justify why she didn't (like maybe she wanted to emulate the world domination aspect of her idol book comic character, or maybe she didn't think it through at all). Instead, she wished for world domination and couldn't handle the power so it fucked over the world. Also, when Eiji wished to shoulder all of the damage she did with that wish, how does it equate to him taking her power, messing both his and her memories, and basically suppressing and replacing their memories of their father? Bah! Moving on!\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, this show doesn't understand any of the downright horrible implications of some of the characters' actions. Let's run down the list, shall we? The Group of Ten basically leaked info to basically ruin a high schooler's life by turning the world against him and manipulating him into their schemes just so they can kill his father and stop his plans, even knowing that both he and his sister were crucial in his plot. That literally makes no sense and the fact that they expect him to go along with it is especially galling. They basically made him a global pariah worse than Adolf Hitler, so no shit he often has a hard time of complying! In episode 4, Eiji and Sena are in bed with him on top in a very sexual position, and then we next see all of their clothes on the floor and an open shower curtain. Regardless of the fact that we only blatantly know that they're just showering together, it's very creepy for a teenage boy to shower with his not much younger sister at their ages. Also, given all of this context, you can imagine that the implications of actual incest run rampant here, which is just not good. Hell, the fact that she kisses him in the final episode of the anime (without any context to blatantly suggest otherwise), it's basically confirmed that she was wanting to have incest with him, or at least heavy implications make it come off that way.\\n\\n\r\nTime for this last example to really sell my point home. In episode 9, Iyo has Eiji handcuffed to a bed with just his shirt off and they take off their clothes, but he is trying to decline sex in favor of current matters, and given the context of what's going on, it's implied from the anime that she was already sorta having sex anyway thanks to Eiji's line about her going any deeper, and again, he never actually consented and she was still trying to have sex with him. Does that sound like rape to you, because it does to me. Don't try to give me some bullshit spheal about \"women can't rape men, that's not how that works; at worst, it's only physically possible for it to be sexual harassment or assault\" since she had him chained up to something without his knowledge or consent and is trying to have (and given the anime's context, likely in the middle of having) sex regardless of his declining (likely because he'd rather save it for a time where his sister wasn't in danger) so that counts as attempted rape, even if none of the characters realize it as such. Do you see what I mean by horrid implications that no character seems to take into consideration regarding their actions!\\n\\n\r\nBefore we get to the real meat of the convoluted nature of the series, let\u2019s also smash a few weird ass scenes apart since, well, this anime is beyond strange. The ultimate example of this is the beginning of episode 5. Kagekiyo basically grabs and fondles the tits of Rin, Mari (the chick with the glasses and lasers), and Iyo, all while basically having an orgasm over their \u201ctwin peaks\u201d when she fondles them enough, getting her ass kicked every time, brushing it off like it's nothing before moving to her next target, and not learning not to be such a perv to other women. All this scene adds is time and discomfort. I've already talked about the episode 4 scene that really hints at incest, so I'll tackle one more scene: Eiji gets an arm and a leg cut off in episode 8, and the moment he uses the Eiji x Iyo fusion of his Order avatar, he can suddenly manipulate his limbs to attach to him for no reason other than asspulls since it was never shown to be able to do that. I know orders defy conventional logic, but they only do that via the user\u2019s ordered actions, not by nature of their existence.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s this whole thing about how the people hate Order users because they hate Eiji for what happened to the world. Problem is, the way they go about this is hamfisted. Civilians in this show are absurdly hateful and are portrayed in this vicious, uncivilized, basically evil light. Also, you know, it seems like none of them try to move on from their grief and put it past them in order to try to live a better life. I get that their families were killed and their lives were inverted but everyone comes off as insanely hateful for the sake of it. I'll address the final thing that makes the civilians on the show horrible when we get there.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, time to delve into the big plot of the second half. Given that the anime ended a few months before the manga did, I can only assume that all of this, or at least a good chunk of it (namely the final episode or 3) was filler, though even with the research I did (without reading the manga or knowing someone who has) I cannot prove this. Well, it turns out that the Group of 10 were initially meant to track down and kill Genai, Eiji\u2019s father, and you can refer to a few paragraphs ago on why that is horse shit when taking everything into account. Also, the bad guys are tracking down and trying to kill mikos. Apparently it's because they are involved in this pentagram involved with the gate to this mental world that he wants to unlock because it was Sena that originally did so, though she couldn't control it, causing the world to be ravaged, apparently so that he can create an infinite amount of parallel universes, including ones where Sena\u2019s wish was granted and she was happy and world peace, even if it means forsaking the universe that we are currently seeing our characters in and everyone storms the place and betrayals and Eiji denouncing his goal and getting stabbed by his sister and then fusing orders and kicking ass and winning and God shows up and the world is now good and now that means everyone sees Eiji as a hero which makes no sense given how much whiplash that is with how hateful they were and good ending and blah blah blah! I'm not even gonna question any more aspects of the finale like the memory parasite robots or anything since my mind is fried beyond belief. \\n\\n\r\nAnother crucial problem is that very few of these characters have any remotely interesting personality to speak of, so I'll prattle a lot of them off quick. The Group of 10 are mostly useless, with only a few of them being relevant like the leader, Mari, Iyo, and 3 other dudes who only do one specific thing like flying, teleporting, and punching, and some of them are so useless that they don't even have any real screen time, and of course, each of them is basically one note and dull, even the fun-loving flying and punching dudes are just meh, and are just there for deus ex machinas. Even the main character Eiji is a boring teen protagonist who is basically Lelouch if he had the personality of an ordinary school protagonist, including his devotion to making his sister happy. Rin is just an annoying chick who always wants to kill Eiji until one final sappy scene where she motivates him in the final episode. Also, yeah, different hair color aside, her design is strikingly similar to that of Yuno from Mirai Nikki. Kagekiyo is just a vengeful and quirky person who also happens to be a total perv (and probably either bi or lesbian given the twin peaks scene in episode 5), and is basically irrelevant aside from episodes 3 and 4, and one scene in the finale. Also, Sena is basically a worse Nunnally who sorta is in love with her brother and is the one  actually responsible for the world ending. Plus, her heel turn in episode 9 was abominable.\\n\\n\r\nNow into the full-blown antagonists. I don't even think most of them have names aside from Jyuubei (the sword guy) and Genai (the main antagonist). Aside from Genso, there nothing but generic, borderline personality-less baddies. It's sad when Fairy Tail can come up with tons of evil teams (Oraci\u00f3n Seis, Tartarus, Grimoire Heart, Phantom Lord, and a good few others) that have each and every character have some kind of defined personality with some of them getting sort of fleshed out, and in rarer cases, even developed and yet no one here has a truly concrete personality aside from the most generic templates of a personality. Genai has this weird obsession with flowers and the series tries its damnedest to make him a sympathetic scientist father whose plans drove him insane and ruined everything for everyone, but when they can't even do a good job with his backstory, the backstory about him for one of the characters, or even how despite supposedly  caring so much for Eiji and Sena he never actually shows care after the major incident (he never looks for them orthopedic to get others to do the same, and he doesn't care how badly their hurt as long as they're alive and useful), even he misses the mark. \\n\\n\r\nI can't even really begin to describe Daisy in any way that isn't how much teasing he does to Eiji about his powers and memories. She is as much of an enigma as the show itself, and I don't think it was as intentional as you might think since we know nothing about her backstory other than the fact that she was used as the vessel of an experiment that caused her to become some kind of floating person that hands out Orders. We never really see that from her perspective, nor does she really have anything concrete about her aside from her great looks and how much she teases Eiji about pertinent information. What was she like before? Did the change affect her in any way? Why did she get a job as a waitress at the end of the series! Despite being one of the more prominent characters in the series, I probably have the least feel for what kind of personality she has. Also, the only Miko we get to know aside from Iyo is Kuroko, a beautiful lady who has perfect vitality and spend her days basically forging couples, and it's funny to hear her get annoyed when Eiji and Iyo don't understand one another and have awkward moments despite them being obviously the pair that will be a couple, though she doesn't really get to do much since she was killed off unceremoniously. She was, all things considered, the best character in the show, and when a basically one-off character is the best character in your entire series, that's pretty pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nThe character art...is inconsistent. Sometimes it looks amazing, with all sorts of wonderful shading to complement the (mostly) wonderful (albeit sometimes borderline copy paste) character designs, and other times, it looks flat with characters having none of that shading. It would've been great if Studio Asread were capable of doing what Studio Wit did with Kabaneri and managed to have the perfect shading all the time instead of only sometimes, but hey, it's better than having the flat looking moments for the characters all the time. Only one design looks terrible and that's Kagekiyo\u2019s, especially with those absurdly pointy nipples that stick out from her g-string big time. The actual animation isn't spectacular but ultimately competent, despite a few laughable moments like the way Eiji turns/slides in episode 2 (I bet you know the scene I'm talking about). The censorship is pretty terrible though, but not as horrid as the usual black bars or even black circles. The kaleidoscope imagery looked nice though, even if the series doesn't really do well in terms of having contrasting light and shadow in the same frame. Also, the CGI is pretty terrible, not just with the avatars, but especially with the nukes in episode 4 and just how prevalent the CGI is, also bogs it all down, especially since it doesn't work well with the aesthetic of the series, nor does it look good on its own. I do at least like when the imagery gets really triply like with the world destruction and with most of the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP \u201cDisorder\u201d by Yousei Teikoku...is certainly fitting in terms of its chaotic nature and how much of a mess Big Order is. I don't particularly like it, especially in comparison to some of her other songs like Mirai Nikki OP 1 or Deus\u2019s character song. The ED \u201cKobore Sekai Oware (\u6bc0\u30ec\u4e16\u30ab\u30a4\u7d42\u30ef\u30ec)\" by Aki Hata is...fascinating. Both somewhat unnerving and simultaneously alluring. I really like it, more so than any other piece of music in the series. The Actual OST is somewhat ok but is really unfitting (with tons of jazz pieces that sound like they\u2019d be playing at certain parts of a fun spy series instead of an anime like this), and some of them, especially the track \u201cDominate\u201d are played over and over again and it gets annoying since none of the tracks (aside from track 7) are particularly good. It's not that they're bad, it's that they are overused and ill-fitting most of \\n\\n\r\nFor a while now, Big Order was easily the most enjoyable train wreck I had ever seen. It's decisions were so baffling and out of left field that I couldn't help but laugh my ass off constantly throughout the first 6 episodes. It wasn't enjoyable in the conventional sense and the episodes got increasingly aggravating, but the last 4 episode felt more aggravating than funny bad, mainly due to how it grew stale and unbelievably convoluted, and the fact that it tried harder than ever to be serious and heartfelt rather than crazy and fun in terms of what it was trying to do. I don't actually hate the ending, partially because I couldn't even care anymore and my mind was crashing like Hindenburg or the Titanic, and blowing up like a Megaman boss. I was more distraught by its failures than infuriated or poised to laugh at them in the last 4 episodes, especially the finale. Plus, certain implications and true ramifications of situations really broke me at times. Nonetheless, I can say that for most part, I consider it to be the first truly effective schlock title I have ever seen, in the way that I laughed my ass off constantly throughout a majority of the run, for whatever that's worth.\\n\\n\r\nBig Order is an absolute mess. It's not just convoluted, but stupidly confusing and confusingly stupid. It becomes legitimately hard to grasp as to what is actually wrong with the story and what is just convoluted and/or absurd but intentional and not harmful. As your mind tries to parse all that, as well as the awful CGI and constant kaleidoscope imagery, as well as the unfitting music that makes you speculate as to what kind of series the OST would better suit, it all moves along at breakneck speeds. It's mentally taxing for sure, and not even mostly good character art, a few good songs, or even kaleidoscope imagery can remotely salvage that. You actively need to be mentally prepared to sit through this show or you will be left in the dust worse than any unprepared schmuck watching episode 20 of Ergo Proxy, which is an actually good anime that comes off as very convoluted at times. Big Order is a big pile \u2018o shit and it deserves its dismal rating. It's sort of fascinating in a way if you\u2019re capable of keeping up somewhat with the absurd narrative and decisions of the show, which is probably its biggest strength despite being fully comprised of the show\u2019s fatal flaws. Only watch this if you're an expert at ripping bad anime to shreds. Everyone else, spare your brain cells. With all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains some spoilers for this masterpiece known as Big Order.\r\nI'm fully confident to say that Big Order is the most misunderstood anime ever released, the fact that it has such a low score everywhere is truly baffling to me.\r\nNow wait, calm down. Drop those stones you're holding there and hear me out for a bit! I too once thought Big Order was a shitshow, especially because its author is the same fella who wrote that ungodly abomination called Mirai Nikki, and Big Order was full of random bullshit just like the previous series, which actually makes me question why Mirai Nikki hasa higher score than this when both are essentially terribly-written trainwrecks that fail at every single thing they try to do... Or is it really how things are? Well, for Mirai Nikki that's definitely the case, but Big Order finally clicked with me on rewatch and I realized that the series is actually a lot smarter than most people think, because unlike Mirai Nikki, it actually treats its absurdly dumb plot points and twists like absurdly dumb plot points and twists! Big Order doesn't try to paint itself as some kind of brilliant 2deep4u work of art like Mirai Nikki does, it's actually quite the opposite: When you're watching it and say \"wow that's fucking ridiculous\", Big Order turns to you and says \"I KNOW RIGHT?\" as it pulls another unbelievable twist right out of its ass in a glorious never-ending show of ingeniously crafted shitstorms. \\n\\n\r\nIt's almost like Sakae Esuno is actually aware of how terrible Mirai Nikki was and decided to make Big Order into a parody of his previous work, laughing at himself for actually writing that garbage without the smallest bit of self-awareness, and maybe even laughing at people who actually think Mirai Nikki is a good series without being ironic about it. Yes, my friends, Sakae Esuno incorporated shitposting into anime and manga before it became a popular thing to do nowadays with shows like Pop Team Epic, Berserk 2016 and Darling in the FranXX. I haven't read the Big Order manga, but the anime adaptation even adds to the shitposting by having a soundtrack that couldn't be any less out-of-place with \"heavy\" and \"dark\" scenes playing out as some bouncy jazz is playing on the background, it's clearly a deliberate move on the director and/or the composer for this anime, they're well aware of the true nature of Big Order and were happy to play along with Sakae Esuno's joke. I like to think that there's a bunch of ninjas who are always playing jazz while hiding themselves somewhere in the scenery, you'll never see them, but you certainly know they're around, and the characters in the series may also know of that, but they choose to ignore the background noise because there's always too much going on.\\n\\n\r\nDo you doubt that Big Order is a spoof of Mirai Nikki, and maybe even some other terribly-written anime? Alright then, explain to me why the protagonist Eiji and one of the girls in his ever-growing harem, Rin, have such a strong similarity with Yukiteru and Yuno from Mirai Nikki in their character designs! Is it because Esuno can only draw those types of characters and nothing more? Of course not, his other manga seems to have fairly distinct character designs, so why would he replicate characters from Mirai Nikki specifically for this particular series? I rest my case. But relax, just because these characters look like Yukiteru and Yuno, doesn't mean that they're the same, Eiji shows more balls in one episode of Big Order than Yukiteru shows in the entirety of Mirai Nikki for once, and Rin isn't really a yandere who wants to keep everyone away from Eiji's cock, in fact she actually hates him and wants him dead for most of the story, obviously because Esuno wants them to be the anti-Yukiteru and Yuno as part of the joke. The basic premise of the story is that there's a bunch of people known as Orders who have Stands with unique abilities each, because no shitposting anime would be fully realized without a JoJo reference, and Eiji is one of those people, he also apparently made some kind of fucked-up wish that caused the apocalypse and people hate him a little bit because of that, but he doesn't give a shit, he's got a cute little imouto called Sena who has AIDS and will die in a few months, but bigger than her disease is her lust for some onii-sama D, so he's just fine. However, it all changes when Rin tries to kill Eiji, which leads him to re-awakening his Stand power, which happens to be the Geass of Absolute Obedience! Thus, Eiji forces Rin to marry him and proceeds to legally rape her with his stand's pointy tentacles as the screen fades to black and some smooth jazz plays on the background.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, Eiji becomes buddies with a bunch of other people who are also Orders and want to take over the world, but most of them don't really matter much aside from the bunny girl called Iyo who gets pregnant because Eiji touches her ribbon... Yes, she says that anyone who touches her ribbon which acts like bunny ears will impregnate her... This actually fucking happens! They take her to a nearby hospital, the nurse says a baby is coming out and later they actually have a discussion about pregnancy and raising kids. How in the world can anyone actually think this was meant to be taken seriously? The show is obviously taking the piss, you're supposed to laugh at how absurd this set-up for a \"romance\" subplot is and be on the edge of your seat for whatever the hell the series will want to throw at you next, and I assure that you won't be disappointed. I don't even want to spoil much of the plot, Big Order such an unpredictable beast that I could be ruining the experience if I spill out too much, and for the record, I showed this series to a friend of mine without letting her know much of what it's like, and she laughed her ass off from beginning to end, which is how we are all meant to react to it.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, the opening is pretty neat, yeah.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the only complaint I have about Big Order is the fact that it's only 10 episodes long, but... Oh God, it's 10 episodes of pure, unadulterated hilarity.",

            "content": "What is a \"Big Order.\" I often find myself asking this, but according to the show a big order is the manifestation of a persons needs or wants to come to come true, however is this anime really as skin-deep as it pretends to be? When starting this masterpiece you are introduced to some quirky characters, but what I told you that none of this matters because this happens to be the worlds longest BURGER KING commercial to ever be recorded. A sane person would be asking himself \"how does this show pertain to burger king?\" Well that's easy to answer, the main characters \"BigOrder\" is to literally have it his way which is the slogan the company introduced in early as the 1980s. It doesn't just end there with their famous slogan because the main character never shuts up about having it his way when it comes to women or even the world. In the end all I have to say is 10/10 had it my way",

            "content": "Unless you've been living under a rock in recent years, you've at least heard of the 2011 anime Mirai Nikki, known as Future Diary in English. Its one of the most popular anime of the last few years, though its reception is very mixed, with some people loving it and others flat-out despising it. A few years after it finished, another series by that series' mangaka was announced to get an anime adaptation for the Spring 2016 season. That series, of course, being Big Order. While opinions on Mirai Nikki are rather split, most can agree with something about Big Order. Its trash.\r\nThe series revolvesaround the concept of the aptly named \"Orders\", which are powers that originate via one's own wishes. Our story primarily focuses on Hoshimiya Eiji, a boy who supposedly caused an apocalypse that wiped out most of the population. As a result of this, he's despised by pretty much everyone, even so far as to get an assassin hired solely for killing him and him alone. Eiji now is on the run and has to save his sister, who is suffering from an illness likely to kill her in a few months. Well, that's what the story SUPPOSEDLY is. In actuality, the plot of Big Order is a huge pile of nonsense. The series can't decide on if it wants to be serious or silly. One of the biggest examples of this is when Eiji makes a miko pregnant but touching her bunny ears of all things during a major chase sequence (just roll with it), causing her belly to instantly swell up. Now, that may SEEM like a big plot point, but they decide to pretty much throw the idea away immediately in the next episode, pretty much making the supposed pregnancy subplot a complete waste of time. This is also one of those shows that thinks that shoving tits and ass into your story automatically redeems it, which it really doesn't. Some plot elements also feel like they're made up on the spot (and not even foreshadowed) solely to create Deus Ex Machinas. Most of the few things in this show that AREN'T incomprehensible are overall dull and feel like they were lazily copied from other manga/anime. (Such as how the Orders have an uncanny resemblance to the Stands from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure) Lastly, the pacing is so ridiculously fast that you have no idea on what's even going on. This is not helped by the atrocious world-building, or lack there of. In addition to having nothing in this world explained, there are some major inconsistencies. For instance, this is apparently a post-apocalyptic setting, but somehow, news buildings and schools survive because plot convenience. How lovely.\\n\\n\r\nBig Order's characters suffer from being both bland and unlikable. Eiji is the stereotypical edgy and obnoxiously loud shounen protagonist with some siscon thrown in for good measure (but its not incest cause they're not blood-related hurr durr (and yes, this IS something in the actual show)). Rin I guess is supposed to be a Yandere, but she lacks the charm of other characters of her type, and only acts according to the plot regardless of whether it fits her character, resulting in a blank slate basically. Sena is Eiji's blood-unrelated sister, and who we are supposed to sympathize for because she's cute and nothing more; even getting asspats by her brother even when she turns out to be a part of one of the major conflicts. The rest of the cast is so forgettable that I don't even remember their names. And considering that there's a lot of them, that's pretty bad. We're just introduced to them suddenly and the audience can't even feel to have a grasp of who they are (their actions make them come off as unmemorable at best); and at most they just serve as plot devices. They attempt to build romantic relationships, but the characters have no chemistry whatsoever so you can't feel invested in any of the romances present.\\n\\n\r\nProduction wise I suppose it looks decent. There are several neat-looking effects used within each episode, though at times they feel sloppily done (particularly in the last episode). The OST, on the other hand, is generally cheesy 80's pop and doesn't even remotely fit in with the designated scenes, and as such, it kills any tension those scenes might've had.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing big about Big Order is that it's a big mess. With a shoddily put together story, a dull cast of characters, and sheer laziness through out, Big Order offers nothing to the table, and as such, I suggest avoiding it like the plague. Now, there is something that may make Big Order somewhat recommendable. Its a great show to laugh at. Even then, its outclassed in that aspect even within its own season. Take Mayoiga, a series that provides the same unintentional hilarity, but at least it's made by staff who want to have fun first and foremost, even if it's not to everyone's liking. Not saying that Mayoiga's even remotely a good show unironically, but at least it's not this.",

You should not watch it under any circumstances unless you don't care about a story, character goals, premis, or anything else, making sense! Think of how Mirai Nikki, towards the end, had plot holes. This show is plot holes from start to finish. The only reason I didn't drop it after the first two episodes wasbecause \"It's only 10 episodes, might as well add to my completed list, eh?\".

Not bad as Divine Gate which is very disappointing. \r\nBig Order may seems like Mirai Nikki trying to do Code Geass because the character have special power to order someone like Code Geass and the design is similar from Mirai Nikki. But that actually make things interesting, it looks like a spin off.\r\nStory is 7, because the first few episode is not very original but there are lots of plot twist along the way evenat episode 10, you cannot expect what will happen next. \\n\\n\r\nArt is 8, I can't complain enough because its great, the design is like Mirai Nikki with some awesome CG animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound is 7, because there is awesome opening by Yousei Teikoku which takes me back dreaming about Mirai Nikki. But the ending is horrible and so creepy.\\n\\n\r\n(Major spoiler coming through) \\n\r\nCharacter is 6, because I admit it that the character development is not very good maybe because of the mind erasing and brain washing (spoiler from episode 10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is 8, because there are many mind blowing scene including fan service and weird-nuts things like getting pregnant when someone touch the bunny ears hahaha (spoiler from episode 3) \\n\\n\r\nOverall is 9, the conclusion is Big Order is not bad and not very good also, so I'm just hopping more people on MAL will rate it 7 or 6 instead of 1 or 2. \\n\\n",

            "content": "How original! A Big Order review with a 1! But instead of explaining all the little details as to why this show sucks so much, I will explain why it deserves a 1 with a much more simple reason.\r\nBig Order is one of those shows were 15 minutes after I finish an episode, I completely forget what the hell I just watched.\r\nNot because the story is complex or deep, meaning the forgetting of a few themes here and there is only natural. (Big Order is a thematically heavy show but really who cares?)\r\nNot because I didn't want to remember anything, since the show was sucha chore to watch in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nBut because remembering anything about this show would be detrimental to my health. Scientists call it post-traumatic amnesia. A state of confusion that occurs after a traumatic brain injury. That's Big Order in a nutshell.\\n\\n\r\nQuiz me on anything about Big Order and I'll probably either not remember anything, or my brain will shut itself off and I'll fall into a deep coma in order to protect my sanity from the nightmare fuel that is Big Order.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll probably be like \"YO THIS MEANS YOUR REVIEW IS INACCURATE CAUSE AMNESIA! YOUR INFO IS FAULTY!\" While my info may be faulty, I'm one of the many victims of this travesty, and we are first hand sources.\\n\\n\r\nI see a lot of people calling it THE COMEDY OF THE SEASON!!!! A show so stupid that it probably took more effort the dumb down the show to its current level than to write a coherent story. An \"intentionally unintentional comedy\" or some shit. And I somewhat agree. Except...\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, Mayoiga is the comedy of the season, thank you very much.\\n\\n\r\nSecond of all, I think being an intentional unintentional comedy really depends on one's viewing habits of the show. \\n\\n\r\nMayoiga became so dumb so fast that I started watching FOR the dumbness. I watched it so that I could laugh at it with my friend. It has a bunch of themes sure, but the execution of the themes coincide with what made the show bad (theme of distrust among strangers = extremely stupid character decisions that never fail to bring a smirk to my ever emotionless face). So really, the themes were part of the unintentional comedy all along.\\n\\n\r\nBig Order isn't really like that... it has a bunch of themes that are just... there. Again, I really don't remember EXACTLY what the hell was in this pile of dung beetle food.\\n\\n\r\nI'll need to think of a theme... hmm...\\n\\n\r\nOh here's one I guess, the theme of obedience. Obey the order! Absolute authority over something! If you're abusing your power for the \"right cause,\" is it justified?\\n\\n\r\nThe main character's power lets him do just that: have absolute control over those within an area around him. They could have done some amazing psychological stuff with this power, and well... they really don't.\\n\\n\r\nSome of it is used solely for comedy, like the Yuno reskin trying to find a way around this power, only to fail miserably. Some of it is used for forced drama, like when some character conveniently has a way around the power, only to result in more bullshit plot points. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and can we also mention how the civilians have like no mind of their own? They are literally just one character copy and pasted a few dozen times. They all think the same, none of them have any sort of subtlety or doubt, and they just follow what some other character is thinking. One character thinks the main character must die, so do the civilians! One character thinks that the main character is worth forgiving, so do the civilians! It's like I'm watching some monty python or something.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I don't want to wrack my brain about this show too long. I can already feel the cancer cells eating away at my temporal lobe. \\n\\n\r\nSee you guys on the other side ;-;\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Hello, are you the one who ordered the Big Order of dog shit?\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm just going to skip the foreplay and get my opinion out of the way: yes, Big Order is shit. The anime community and their family members who only know about Japanese cartoons through the posters on the wall have already declared it as shit from the moment the first episode aired, and the series quickly became known as one of the worst anime of all-time around the episode when a nuclear bomb was halted by a teenager boy's open palm. And whilst I never really care about popular word because I am a lonely hermit who refuses to join in \"best girl\" conversations forfear of catching AIDS (Anime Is Da Shit), trying to defend Big Order is like trying to defend Bill Cosby. No matter what side you're on or what result comes out of this trail, the fact remains that the subject in question isn't going to win. Although Big Order did get licensed by Crunchyroll for a DVD release, so maybe that analogy is weaker than I already thought it was.\\n\\n\r\nNot quite sure where this show's massive hate base came from - at least, not compared to every other boring, inconsequential, and downright awful anime of which we get at least ten of every season - but I will say that if the parents in The Monkey's Paw had actually seen their kid, he'd probably look like a visual representation of this series' technicals. For starters, whenever something titillating happens in this show, there's always a bright flash of light that makes it look the images had been caught on fire prior to airing and the production team decided to just air it anyways because they made a deal with Satan and he's very stingy regarding when he wants his animu. Apparently, Satan isn't so stingy regarding whether he can actually see the underage boobage or what's actually happening in general, because the fire engulfed like 90% of the frames whenever a scene happens in order to make pre-pubescent boys experience their first erection, and since Big Order is a schlock anime, you're going to be seeing quite a bit of damaged footage by the time it finishes. You'll also notice watching the show that the violent images in this series were reportedly evacuated from the fire before it got too big, but because they're directed with about as much enthusiasm as a USA police officer has for a black person's safety and animated with a budget of three nickels, I speak no hyperbole when I say that a bunch of stick figures duking it out would have been more exciting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a lot has already been said about the sound mixing and choice of music, which is so utterly mismatched regarding what's going on that you could have put on one of those never-ending loop videos featuring a Rick Astley song and it would have blended in just as well. I wasn't really paying attention to it because the show aired on the same day as four other anime I kept up with and I mostly played video games when going through the boring half of that output just to keep myself from falling asleep, but the fact that I can't remember a single tune doesn't speak well for the composer of that shit. But of course, what else can you expect from asread? You know asread, right? The guys who gave us Shuffle, and then gave us Shuffle again? Can you imagine the censorship in that show if aired today? Depending on who you are, you'll either get more pissed off at the series than you already are now or laugh like a hyena because your mind has broken to the point that you can't imagine what you're watching.\\n\\n\r\nBut even if you did put yourself into the mindset of the four or five complete freaks who will always like your horrible product and accept the horrendous production, you still have to deal with the story and characters - or lack thereof because this show's handling of them is so poor that it makes Angel Beats look like Six Feet Under. The plot is focused on a young middle-school kid named Eiji, a kid who screams \"I want to be Lelouch\" so much that he might as well have had the costume included with his summoning of the Jojo/Ajin stands that represent the superpowers in this show and give him the ability to control people. He was apparently responsible for destroying the world in his youth in order to protect his younger dying sister, and due to the terror caused by that incident, he isolates himself from the rest of the world with only some mysterious girl who's name I can't remember due to how little importance she actually had to keep him company. One day however, another mysterious girl named Rin transfers to his classroom, intent on taking revenge for her family due to them being a casualty of Eiji's crime, only to be put under his control and turned into his masochistic love slave thanks to her immortality. However, with her comes a giant organization intent on exploiting Eiji's powers for their own gain, and Eiji ends up awakening to his potential as an Order user in order to deal with all that happening in his life, keep his sister happy, and save/destroy the world. What follows is what I can only describe as the writers of this show throwing out a ton of toys from their Geass/Evangelion-ripoff box and seeing which one sticks.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really appalling just how much happens in this show and yet not a single thing that does is engaging because of the show's utter disregard for context. There's a lot of plot, but there's so little story behind it to the point that it feels like an abridged series without the dubbing. Eiji himself is pretty bland as a lead character, only being defined by what the plot tells him to do and nothing else when it takes a break. The only thing close to an engaging hook is the questions brought up regarding whether you'd save or destroy the world if you had the power to do so, but Big Order never expounds on the philosophies the characters have towards this theme with anything more than either a token \"well that's how they feel\" or because \"I'm an anime character\", which is about as tacked on a reason as you can get short of \"because I'm in a porno\". And speaking of being an anime character, it's really hard to take anyone seriously because they all look like rejected cosplay competitors, they're all lame anime stereotypes whose humor blends poorly with the setting, and all the girls and one or two guys fall for our bland male character's cock to the point that they don't mind actually getting pregnant from him. Oh and yes, that pregnant or not pregnant bunny girl looks a lot like Rei Ayanami. Because you can't be a post-90s anime if you're not ripping off Evangelion (and you can't be a post-2012 anime if you're not ripping off Jojo).\\n\\n\r\nI strongly advise not trying to connect everything that happens on your first watch, because there are some things in life that the human mind just isn't made to comprehend. The best I can summarize it is that there's this organization that opposes the one that wants to use Eiji, his father is the true reason behind the world's destruction, his sister is incredibly vital to the plan, there's a bunch of crazy men, there's a bunch of even crazier ladies, and not a single thing I just spoiled matters because the ending shits over everything that happened prior in a way that I won't go into, but let's just say I didn't make that Eiji: The Harem King joke earlier lightly. Oh, and there's incest. According to manga fans, the incest is something the anime added because\u2026there is no justification to add incest. It's incest. It's fucking disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nBut then again, I guess that's why it was included in the first place. Because one thing I've learned from watching Evangelion clone after Evangelion clone is that they always focus on the more disturbing parts of that series and never on, y'know, the reason why those disturbing parts worked in the first place? And Big Order definitely does not break that mold, what with its prepubescent sex, violent usage of superpowers, and of course, the nuclear missile I mentioned earlier. Of course, Devadasy at least had some balls in regards to its pretentious imagery. For all of Big Order's claims to be edgy trash, it never goes far enough with that adjective and just ends up being plain trash. None of that prepubescent sex I mentioned leads to anything interesting let alone actual penetration, and the violence is hard to take seriously when it's executed like a Xebec production. You know Xebec, right? The guys responsible for Argevollen and Tokyo ESP? Why yes, I did remind you those shows existed, and now you want to kill me for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only positive I really have for Big Order is that the monochrome effect used to indicate a different dimension in the final episode was alright. Other than that though, Big Order is a classic victim of being birthed from a lack of imagination and teeth, unable to make what it rips off its own and suffering massively for it. I wouldn't join its massive hate base in calling it one of the worst anime of all-time, but I also wouldn't recommend it even if you're a trash-lover. Most of the trash anime this year alone at least had good animation and visual direction that could carry you if you just mute the screen and turn off the subtitles. The only way Big Order would look good to you is if you wore sunglasses and then poured acid all over your eyes.",

            "content": "Sometimes, we inexplicably watch awful shows. Why we watch them or how isn't relevant; we just sit down and do it. And sometimes, we come across shows that are so offensively awful that we sit down and wonder what was even the point, or shows that are so blatantly offensive that we have no clue why would anyone in their right-mind derive any kind of enjoyment from them.\r\nBefore moving further, I need to stress out something; if you liked Mirai Nikki, then that does not necessarily mean you will like this show. I am no fan of Mirai Nikki, but for what its worth, itwas at least colorful and entertaining enough to watch all the way to the end.\\n\r\nAlso, if you were looking for a quick answer as to whether or not a show is worth watching, here's one; this is only worth watching for all the wrong reasons, aka the so bad it's good rule.\\n\\n\r\nBig Order isn't colorful, but it certainly is entertaining for a wide variety of reasons.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, the story is complete and utter garbage. I've never seen a story constantly break rules literally minutes after making them, then make even more rules to attempt to cover that up...and fail miserably. Not only that, but the characters' actions in comparison to what is actually going on makes no sense the more you think about it; this story more or less reeks of the feeling that the \"writer\" was making up the story as she rolled with it rather than any particular thought that was put into the \"script\".\\n\\n\r\nOh, and let us not forget the dialogue. It largely consists of our main character screaming \"SENA\" and Sena screaming \"EIJI\" or more infamously \"ONII-CHAN\" (in a manner that would put most hentai doujins to shame), as well as its various dumb attempts at drama.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of drama, have I mentioned how absolutely retarded some of these character powers are? A girl that gets pregnant if a guy touches her? The main character basically having what feels like the combination of the Geass power from Code Geass and a Stand from Jojo without half the thought that went into either? The main pseudo-heroine (and I refer to her a pseudo-heroine because the main heroine is clearly SENAAAAAAAAAAAA) being immortal? The list goes on and on, but to put it simply; these powers feel like they were slapped together without the slightest shred of thought as to how they would affect the immersion of the story. But no power is as immersion breaking as Eiji's ability to control territory; seriously, this power is so broken that it ruins all immersion that the story would have because there's no feeling of tension, since we, the viewers, always know that he'll come out on top.\\n\\n\r\nThat, and its dumb excuse of...nationalism? Seriously, why would a council of totally generic villains want to control the world again? \\n\\n\r\nThematically speaking, this show is broken...because I actually have no point what it's about, even after all is said and done. The script takes influence from a lot of works like I said earlier, ranging from Code Geass to Jojo to Evangelion to elements from the writer's earlier work, Mirai Nikki. But NOTHING works; at some point we have the nationalist themes from Code Geass, then another where it has Stands like Jojo, and then the last bits of the show go full-on End of Evangelion on everyone for no reason. COPYING AND PASTING PARTS OF SCRIPTS FROM OTHER WORKS DOES NOT WORK.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are horrible. I'm referring to each and every single last one of them, by the way; at least in Mirai Nikki the entire cast was colorful, if exaggerated to hell and back, and I even had a couple of characters I liked. Here? Not a single one. That being said, they're all entertaining to watch...because they're all bloody idiots. Eiji could've probably won the entire time if certain circumstances and information was given to him at the beginning, and the fact he WASN'T given said information makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nNotYuno (I can't even remember her name, she's that irrelevant) is basically Yuno, only not as entertainingly crazy and more of the entertainingly random, if only because her characterization makes no sense and she acts like an idiot who also happens to like the guy who might've murdered everyone and caused an apocalypse only to seduce him on numerous occasions then go yandere then go back again and...do you see where I'm going with this?\\n\\n\r\nSena is...well, discussing her would spoil the whole show, but I only have two words: Onii-chan.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is more or less the same style as Mirai Nikki, which is OK I guess. What is not OK is the absolutely atrocious animation quality, which has absolutely horrid use of CGI throughout the show, lots of still frames and repeated shots, little to no movement for most of the show and incredibly annoying looking dark shading that feels like the whole show is trying to be darker than it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is equally horrible, voice-acting is bad, and all in all, I do not recommend this show...\\n\\n\r\n...But wait, I do. I recommend this show. This show is entertainingly bad in ways that I didn't think humanly possible. It's the very definition of...well, not a trainwreck, since you actually need to have a train moving properly to go wrong. This is complete and utter chaos, and the sheer combination of all of said elements make for an incredibly entertaining watch, especially if with friends or drunk...though the sheer awfulness of this show may straight up make you want to kill yourself if you get depressed while drinking. Actually, maybe just skip the drinking part, I don't want blood on my hands.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else? Stay as far away as humanly possible.",

            "content": "Let\u2019s talk about Big Order.\r\nBig Order is known as one of the biggest trainwreck in the history of japanese animation. The insanity and sheer stupidity of the show has now become legendary and it\u2019s the only reason I decided to watch the show. \r\nNow, if you only watch the first episode, you\u2019re probably gonna think it\u2019s just another bland, poorly written anime like many other anime and you would be so wrong. The true nature of Big Order only shows his ugly head after the first episode and after that, it never tries to hide it again. This show has the most nonsensical story Ihave ever witness\u00a0; even manga like Riki-Oh can\u2019t compete with Big Order. It\u2019s so stupid and his constant need to contradict itself every two seconds with the dumbest thing ever actually  made me believe that Big Order is a parody. It has to be. No show can be that stupid and not doing it on purpose.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start by talking about Eiji, the main character. He represents very well the experience that is Big Order: he is simply the worst in every way. First, he is seriously the real vilain of the story to the point where he actually fights to destroy a world where everyone could be happy. And don\u2019t get your hopes up people, the serie and the rest of the cast still treat him like a hero, even if he is the complete opposite of it. But what make Eiji really special it\u2019s how he literally makes no sense at all as a character\u00a0: he is, at the same time, a wannabe rapist, shy in love, a guy who want to save the world, a guy who don\u2019t care about he world, an idiot who don\u2019t understand anything, a smart guy who understand everything, a nice guy who saves people, an asshole who tortures people, someone who wants to protect his sister, someone who his r*aping his underrage sister (yes), someone who wants to create a perfect world for his sister except when he has the actual opportunity to do it\u2026 And no I am not making any of this stuff up, he really is all over the place and make no sense at all, like the overall crapfest that is BO.\\n\r\nAlso he is one of the hateful MC I have seen in while\u00a0: not only he is a r*apist (and no cares about it of course) but he screams \u00ab\u00a0Senna\u00a0\u00bb at least 20 times per episode like the whiny bitch he is, to the point that even Snow from FF XIII would ask him to shut it. You can stab him, cut his arms or legs, Eiji will still be screaming \u00ab\u00a0Senna\u00a0\u00bb over and over... And poor Morita who had to voice such an awful twat\u2026 And by the way, even his powers don\u2019t make sense\u00a0: sometimes he is overpowered and sometimes he is not. No explanation is EVER given of course because that\u2019s how Big Order rule\u00a0: logic is for the weak, only insanity and stupidity are needed.\\n\\n\r\nReally, the show is all over the place, makes no sense in the slighest and love to forgot things it just introduce. For example, out of nowhere, we have actual gods who show up but don\u2019t worry our dear Eiji doesn\u2019t even care to see them (he actually ignore them even if they are the one who can actually save his sister) and then 5 minutes after, the gods disappears completely from the story with no explanation. Classic Big Order\u00a0! Oh you want more\u00a0? Well, the show introduce Rei Ayan- I mean Iyo, a girl with a red ribbon. Eiji touchs her ribbon and she become instantly pregnant\u00a0: she cries but Eiji promise that he will take responsability. Five minutes after, Iyo is gonna give birth to the baby except after that, the plot completely forgot about the existence of the said baby. Iyo is suddenly no more pregnant anymore and except for three throwaway lines that don\u2019t explain ANYTHING, the baby like the gods disappears completely from the story. Again, I\u2019m not making any of this stuff up\u00a0: now you know why Big Order is know for being an absolute trainwreck. Because it is one. And I could continue for hours like since the makers of this masterpiece made sure that absolutely nothing made any kind sense in this show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the rest of the cast\u00a0I hear you ask? Hahahahaha, fools\u00a0! If I can give Big Order one thing is that the show is consistent\u00a0: the \u00ab\u00a0cast\u00a0\u00bb is as bad as the rest of the show.\\n\r\nWe have Rin, who is basically a parody of Yuno from Mirrai Nikki. She has a decent backstory but the story take a massive dump on her everytime it can\u00a0: she gets her ass kicked constantly and is one of the biggest idiot of the show which is an statement someone cannot make lightly. She wants to kill the man responsible for the death of her parents except when she doesn\u2019t want or forgets about it. Her relationship with the MC, our dear rapist Eiji\u00a0? Simple my friend\u00a0: She hates him  because she think he killed her parents okay, but wait no she actually likes him now for no reason but no back to hating him oh no she is loving him again\u2026 Again no explanation for this behavior.\\n\r\nThen, we have Senna, the sister of Eiji. While they are not blood related, she is, like her BIG BRO, an awful character who manage to be even more digusting than Eiji, which is a feat really. She is a naive girl, except when she is evil but sometimes she is nice\u2026 You know the drill by now, she also doesn\u2019t make a lick of sense. The only thing she is consistant about is f*cking her brother and I don\u2019t get why anyone would want save her. \\n\r\nThe show also introduce the Ten, a group of powerful orders (people with powers) and they seem to be very important for the plot. Except they aren\u2019t. Only Iyo, Rin and White Hair matters. We kinda get to know three others, Glasses Girl, Rip-Komamura-Off and Fran but they barely do anything for the plot which is kinda sad since Fran is the only character of the all show who seem to be a decent guy. The rest I hear you ask\u00a0? Well, nothing. While two of them have interesting design, I can\u2019t even call them characters. They will show up at random, at best throw two or three meaningless lines that changes nothing and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a shame because I really wanted to see more of \u00ab\u00a0Big Wood\u00a0\u00bb and sadly, he doesn\u2019t even speak. And Big Order loves do that by the way\u00a0: they introduce many, MANY characters but refuse to do anything with them and ultimately, forget about them completely. Some were clearly created for the BIG fan service moment in episode 5 (5 to 10 minutes devoted to a woman harrassing others women in a bath, fantastic) but the others\u00a0? I don\u2019t know. They created at least 15 characters who have no purpose, probably because the makers of this shitstorm are insane.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Big Ordeaaaah is a parody. It has to be. Not just because I refuse to live in a world where this shitshow was made legit but also because I quickly checked the manga. And yes, the manga seem to be way less stupid\u00a0: Eiji is no more a wannabe rapist and there is no incest-pedo relationship with his sister. Now, I haven\u2019t read that much and yes, the manga doesn\u2019t seem to be good either but it doesn\u2019t look as awful as the anime. So my guess is that the anime was made terrible on purpose for some reason. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m giving a 5\u00a0: because when you accept that Big Order is a Big Joke, it\u2019s kinda fun. I actually laugh a couple of time while watching it (the ending of episode 2 was fantastic) and it\u2019s almost a \u00ab\u00a0so bad it\u2019s good\u00bb anime.. It\u2019s a trainwreck, a shitfest that deserve a watch if you\u2019re into that kind of stuff\u00a0: it has to be seen in order (hahaha) to be believed. However, unlike masterpieces like Samurai Cop or Miami Connection , Big Order is still annoying a lot of the time: I mean watching a show with a plot that make no sense but act like it does, filled with awful, unlikeable characters with mediocre fights scenes is not easy. Ah yes , I almost forgot to tell, there is barely any fight scenes in this anime and all of them are mediocre anyway (because of poor animation). Some characters have interesting powers but of course, they barely use it at all.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the OST is good. Even if they love to place some songs at inappropriate times. Because of course they do, that\u2019s the way of Big Order.",

            "content": "Have you ever wondered why you aren't happy in the universe you are living in? It's probably because somewhere deep down in your subconscious you know this anime exists. I can only wonder what type of madness or psychotic affliction plauged the creators of this show when they made it. Now before I continue ranting on how bad this show is, allow me to break it into the specific categories.\r\nSTORY: Now let me tell you, this section shouldn't exist. The creators of the show created a world where there logically shouldn't be a story. The characters have all the tools at there disposals to instantlysolve any problem they are faced with, but they don't. The creators had to suck all intelligence away from a large majority of the characters just to make sure that they didn't break the universe and achieve their goals during episode 1-2. In fact I would like you to play a game while watching Big Order. Count all the ways that the main characters sister could be healed but isn't. Let's see if you can keep the number under five. The story doesn't make any sense, and logic and reasoning are sacrificed in (Big) order to keep the story going. There is some enjoyment to be had however, to watch the fallacies unfold while the show takes itself very very seriously. It's quite bizzare how the show thinks it is being clever and smart but in reality it just makes he viewer want to bang their head against a wall because of how dumb everything is. Also something I noticed is the show gets less and less intelligent the farther into it you watch. By the time you reach the last episode the show just unloads a large pile of nonsense on the viewer, but the main character is crying and yelling so I guess they were trying to have it by climactic, but in reality it was the largest pile of nonsense I have ever seen on screen.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Hoshimya Eiji is the main character and one of the most powerful characters I have ever seen in any form of media...he is also one of the least intelligent so it balances out. This character is a high level reality warper and his powers extend to being able to manipulate people, and yet he still finds himself being manipulated and controlled by the people under his control. He is also a selfish asshole, and after completing the show, has me convinced that he is the main antagonist while the supposed \"villians\" of the show are actually the good guys. Eiji is the type of character who would actively fight against every one to ever exist receiving eternal happiness, and the turn around and achieve that for himself while the rest of humanity continues to suffer. But it's okay because he cries and screams alot so that means that he is a deep and interesting character...right?\\n\\n\r\nHoshimya Sena is Eiji's useless sister and his love interest. If you haven't built up a resistance to incest in your entertainment after Game of Thrones, this anime (alone wih 50% of other animes) will help you achieve that goal. Creepy love interest aside, she is Eiji's sister and definitely got the dominant Dumb gene just like her brother, only she has a healthy dose of crippling illness that is supposed to make me want to sympathise with her, but in reality I wish she had died the first time she got stabbed. Really the only reason I am even talking about her is because she is a key component in one of the shows least intelligent moments, and that is saying alot because this show is filled to the brim with dumb moments. There is nothing redeemable about this character even though the show tries to make her a very deep character.\\n\\n\r\nIyo is the best character in the show and one of the best characters ever made in any anime ever. I heavily encourage you to watch this show just until you learn what is special and her rabbit ears. It is bound to have you die from laughter because it is one of the most silly concepts ever invented and yet is executed in a very serious and non comedic manner, which successfully amplifies the hilarity.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : As a masochist I love watching bad anime in (big) order to make fun of them. Big Order is a great anime to watch for this purpose. It will make you wonder what type of mental disease the person who had this show pitched to them and still decided to throw their money at it. Things happen in this show that don't need to because anyone wih half a brain could have solved the issue three episodes ago. Don't get me wrong this show is terrible. Like Mahouka terrible. But it is one the best comedies to come out this year. You should watch it just to have your mind go numb from trying to figure the show out. Unless you aren't into intentionally putting yourself through torturous situations because you enjoy the tingly feeling of pain roiling throughout every cell of your body until it makes you want to scream in ecstasy ... and if that's the case, I guess to each their own.\\n",

            "content": "There is a lot bad things being said about Big Order anime, and while many of them are true, I believe it's hated more than it deserves. Why? I'll try to explain it in this review!\r\nStory:\r\nWeakest and, in a way, strongest point of Big Order. First of all, take a look at the genre: action shounen. It's not another Mirai Nikki, and while synopsis and even first episode kinda sell it as something more psychological, it is not. It's action anime and if you expect anything more, you will be seriously disappointed.\r\nSaying it's rushed would be a huge understatement. Things happen too fast with toofew explanations, leading to plot holes, illogical developments and deus ex machina solutions.\\n\r\nOn the other hand it's interesting and unique. The story managed to keep me interested through whole anime and some twists even surprised me - and I don't mean unpredictable ones caused by the lack of explanations earlier in the story. Conflict, while chaotic and, again, lacking deeper explanation, makes one wonder who is right. By the last episode I wasn't sure if protagonist is doing the right thing - that is a huge plus for me.\\n\r\nIn the end I believe all the shortcomings of the story are coming down to time and pacing. If this anime had 26 episodes and everything was explained and developed before progressing further, I'm sure we'd be talking totally differently about Big Order now.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nWhen it comes to graphics, Big Order is doing fine. Nothing special - it just looks good, with some better and worse moments. Though big minus for censored bath episode!\\n\r\nNow, sound is where it gets good. Music is nice, sure, but what's more important is using it during episodes. So often all the msuic in anime is limited to OP and ED, I just can't ignore when music starts playing in middle of episode! While it could be played more often and we could also use more variety, it's still very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSimilar situation to what I wrote about story - not enough time, not enough development, not enough explaining. Yes, they are interesting. Damn, I'd even say they were great characters, especially Rin with her yandere/tsundere mix, but with how rushed everything was, I can only say \"wasted potential\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI'm not sure how I would feel if I watched it while airing, but doing it my usual way - by watching all at once - I wasn't bored even for one second, which for me qualifies it as an enjoyable anime. It might not be some piece of art, but it serves its purpose of burning free time perfectly and ends in a way that leaves watcher satisfied.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Being made from the creator of the utter monstrosity that is future diary , big order was bound to fail from the start. It's hard to find a writer who fails so hard at telling a story without any form of self awareness. It's somehow even more badly written than future diary but thankfully less annoying. The anime adaptation only expands on the flaws by adding new scenes that are even worse than what happened in the manga. This is what happens when you hire the creator of boku no pico( I'm dead serious) to write the script .\r\nTo be fair, the series did havepotential to be good. Eiji accidentally caused the apocalypse ( through a dumbly worded wish) and he has to cope with it as well as  having to take care of his sister. Could've been a nice character driven drama but nope  The first episode/chapter was strong but things just go downhill from there. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nA character named Rin appears who's literally a dumber version of yuno but with a homicidal rage against mc. While her wanting to get revenge on eiji after her parents died in the apocalypse, that's her all there is to her character. She acts angry and homicidal towards eiji whenever she's not having forced as hell ship tease moments with him. \\n\\n\r\nNothing about the story or characters really stood out. Things just happen and the audience is given no reason to care.  How is it even possible to make a cast of super powered individuals be boring as a brick wall? At least the cast of future diary could evoke emotion in me even if it was mostly annoyance.the only names here I remember are eiji,Rin and Sena and none of them are interesting at all.These people are just archetypes and tools used to move the garbage plot forward. There's a character called Daisy who's essentially a goddesses but nobody questions her existence and her purpose is very poorly defined. Another character is iyo who gets pregnant when eiji touches her ears and tries to rape him in the anime cause she fell in love with his basic bland unseasoned chicken personality in a heartbeat. Said attempted rape never gets mentioned again after it happens.  Not only is it offensively bad but if the genders were reversed, I'm sure male iyo would be portrayed as a villain so seeing her get off Scott free is annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also thought it was a good idea to add disgusting incest subtext that wasn't in the manga. Eiji and sena have a implied sex scene and the show wants viewers to think they're in love. This was nothing more than the director and scriptwriter pleasuring themselves seeing as how said incest does absolutely nothing to develop the two and is never referenced again. Again the lack of self awareness is crazy.\\n\\n\r\nReaders aren't given good explanations on character motivation at all. I read the manga and watched the anime but I still don't understand the reasoning behind most of these characters. A few people wanna take over the world and that's about it . Why has noone made a wish to undo the great destruction. Daisy grants wish to random people and not one of them at least thought of restoring the world? When nobody has any solid motives or decent personalities, the plot will obviously bomb. The story wouldn't have been this bad if the writer didn't try to make it complex. I would much rather have read a JoJo esque battle shonen than this poor excuse of a story. At least then it would've been popcorn entertainment.The story makes no sense because things just happen without clearly defined reasons so the entire series is just a narrative non sequitur.. \\n\\n\r\nThe most positive thing about the series was definitely the stands er I mean orders. Many people complained that the powers were too op( they're really not) and were confusing. One person even called eiji one of the strongest characters in fiction which honestly made me laugh. Op powers are good when handled well but everything is shit here. \\n\\n\r\nEiji can control the environment and people around his perimeter with little restrictions yet he always gets his ass kicked. There's literally a 100 of ways he can win any given battle and fails to use any of them. He can condense the air to make a shield but rarely uses that ability and never uses it to suffocate his enemies. He never commands enemies to attack themselves. To make it even worse,. His power is a weakened form of his maximum potential and in the manga he can fuse with other orders to get even stronger. Even then he still gets his ass handed to him\ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude44. The sheer lack of creativity from both the creator and character is just marvelous.How is it even possible to be this incompetent?\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are no better. Leader guy has a rip-off order of kumagawa misogi's all fiction from medaka box. Fact from fiction ( even the names are similar) let's him negate events from reality. Unlike kumagawa who marvelously screws over the main cast from his manga with his ability, leader guy doesn't advance the plot at all and does not have any noteworthy battles. You also have a guy who can atomize anything, a girl who shoots lasers, a man who can brainwash others and a terrorist who controls rocks. Besides from the terrorist chick, none of these people use their abilities in innovative ways.The writer could've taken lessons from JoJo, one piece and even law of ueki( so underrated) when it comes to writing superpowers.\\n\\n\r\nThe endings of both anime and manga are around just as bad but the manga might be even worse. The anime has a inconclusive ending where the world no longer hates eiji and he just goes to to school. That's it. The climactic battle was him using the full power of his order to manipulate abstract concepts to create a world where Sena can be happy. I'm sure the writers didn't intend for eiji's last order to be as op as I just described but it Is. He wishes for something abstract and it comes true which implies he would be able to manipulate other concepts. And yet , he doesn't do anything about the rundown world he lives in. For a post apocalyptic setting, the apocalyptic event barely had any influence on the characters or plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga comes up with a dumbass plot twist that sena was the one who caused the great destruction and eiji was just covering up for her.  She turns evil and tries to destroy the world cause she's evil. Eiji refuses to let anyone kill the potential mass murderer and constantly protects her. Did I mention Rin and eiji and kinda low key dating at this point? Eiji faces sena in a anticlimactic battle followed by a 1 year timeskip where their current date is unknown. And people thought Naruto had a bad ending.....  With how abrupt and lazily put together the ending was, I can't tell if the manga was cancelled or the creator lost interest. Both options seem highly likely.\\n\\n\r\nWith it's bland characters, nonsensical plot and poorly thought out powers, big order is a utter clusterfuck if a show that continues to fade into obscurity. Even having a big name creator wasn't enough to keep it within the public eye. I was hoping for a so bad it's good experience but this was just hot garbage .\\n\\n",

            "content": "I hate to write two scathing reviews in a row, but as it turned out Big Order just happened to end before any of the other shows I was going to review. I was almost certain that Big Order would win the feces-coated award for worst anime of the spring 2016 season, but as it turns out another show airing snatched it away. More on that one later...\r\nSo, what is Big Order? The original Big Order manga started publishing on September 26, 2011 and is currently ongoing. The series itself was actually created by none other than Sakae Esuno, the original creator of Mirai Nikki!As it turns out, it's very similar to his other creation. The first anime adaptation of this story actually was the OVA that aired on October 3, 2015 and was produced by Lantis and the Asread studio. That entry however didn't quite catch as much attention as the 10-episode TV series that I'm reviewing. This entry is 10 episodes long and aired during the Spring 2016 season. Its notoriety has risen significantly as the show has gone on, baffling viewers with its nonsensical story and insulting plot choices. So, how does Big Order fare?\\n\r\n---------\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWell, it certainly doesn't shine in the writing department. Big Order is the story of Eiji Hoshimiya and his desire to save his sister. Also he and other people have super powers called \"Orders\" that allow them to do whatever is most convenient to the plot at that moment. The Orders themselves are one of the bigger problems for this show. For starters, the concept is completely uninspired. Orders themselves basically are just super powers, and the way they interact with each other is confusing and nonsensical. There are Orders that reverse certain realities, Orders that make other people do whatever the user wants, Orders that heal any injuries, and you should be able to tell where this is going by now. With powers that are that grand and overpowered, the way they're used is just stupid. Eiji's power allows him to dominate anything within a certain vicinity, and it's established that he can manipulate air pressure. If this is true, he can manipulate hydrogen and oxygen, meaning he can apparently manipulate any element, at the very least nonmetals. What's stopping him utilizing the carbon and nitrogen in the air and poisoning people around him? He could pretty much choke out anyone who gets in his way, but the only time he ever does something like this is stop a missile. Eiji's and other character's failure to maximize the potential of their powers creates TONS of plot holes like that and emphasize the lazy writing in general.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of lazy writing, the plot twists towards the end of the show really got on my nerves. Generally speaking, it's a bad idea to include tons of plot twists at the end of a show. Why is that? Because inevitably you're going to have to force in tons of exposition to explain how the twists are possible, which goes against the rules of writing a story. You want your story to feature the culmination of everything you've built up at the climax, with a lot of conflict resolution and not a lot of explaining things. And that's exactly the problem here. The amount of exposition in the last 2 episodes essentially kills the pacing of the show all in one swoop. While Big Order appeared to be building towards something, it ends up just writing itself into a corner that it has to spend the entire conclusion explaining itself out of. Also, none of these plot twists really change anything. Most of them are due to someone's memory being altered, and I shouldn't need to tell you how overdone and irritating the memory change trope is. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's the insulting story choices. The main reason my score is so low for Big Order is how little the writers respect the intelligence of the audience. There are far too many instances of inappropriate fanservice and nonsensical story choices that no rational human being would accept. \\n\\n\r\nStory/writing gets a 1/10.\\n\r\n--------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation:\\n\\n\r\nI actually really like the art and animation, believe it or not. The art style in particular caught my eye and was the reason I initially started watching it, and I can honestly say that it's the lone bright spot in Big Order. While the character designs aren't very interesting, the overall visual style of Big Order does set it apart and the animation looks pretty solid outside of the 3-D animation that's occasionally used. Overall, not bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation gets a 7/10. \\n\r\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department for me is a big \"meh\". The sound design and voice acting are passable, and the soundtrack is pretty alright. Ultimately though, the music didn't have a large influence on the show as a whole so I'm inclined to not worry too much about the quality of the music. However, the opening theme (\"Disorder\" by Yui) is awesome. Using that was a great choice.\\n\\n\r\nSound gets a 5/10.\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, they certainly don't help the effort. Eiji himself is pretty much unlikable and uninteresting, while his character motivation is unbelievably shallow. Rin Kurenai is listed as the other main character, but I have to thoroughly disagree with this. She isn't developed nearly enough nor is she interesting enough to justify her top billing. With regards to the supporting cast, there's no one that sticks out as memorable outside of Sena, who is only memorable due to the weird plot twist that involves her and the bizarre relationship she has with her brother Eiji.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters get a 2/10.\\n\r\n--------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI don't grade for enjoyment. Instead, I'll substitute it with this:\\n\\n\r\nWhy you should watch:\\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, I do think Big Order is worth watching. It could certainly be argued that, due to the nonsensical and sheer stupidity of the plot, it crosses into the realm of \"so bad it's good.\" If you and some friends want a shitty anime that you can laugh at and shit all over, Big Order can certainly satisfy. \\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's Big Order. The story is insulting and full of plot holes and stupid story choices, the characters are shallow and uninteresting, and as a whole the entire thing just sucks.\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Big Order is a 2/10. Watch if you want a bad show you can laugh at, otherwise avoid it.",

            "content": "I found this to be a mess. A bigger mess then anything I've seen up to this point, not counting those legendary ones, like Skelter Heaven and Shitcom.\r\nLadies and gentleman, from the creator of Mirai Nikki we receive another way too edgy story with another yandere who falls in love with a weak, dumb MC that just happens to get an OP power: Big Order. However, this time, we get even more of all that in less episodes.\r\nDoesn't that just sound wonderful and encouraging?\r\nStory: 3\r\nMirai Nikki's story wasn't great by any means, but it at least had something going for it at most parts. Itwasn't executed as good as anyone would hope, but it tried. Big Order didn't even do that. It never tried. The author stole every idea from his last popular work and recreated them in a different setting. I am not one to consider unoriginality an issue. I think that if something is made well, it doesn't matter if it was done before, but this wasn't done well. Much worse actually.\\n\r\nSo the story revolves around Eiji, a guy who apparently kiled millions of people and almost caused the end of the world. How? You see, \"Orders\" exist in this world. Each order has a different power that comes from a wish they once made. His wish was to conquer the world, and that somehow almost destroyed the world completely. You would think this plot could be interesting, and you would be right. But it ends up not being anything close to that. It consistently got worse every time something was revealed. I think there was only one plot twist that caght me by surprise, and it happened at the end of the anime. Other then that, we get stupidity. It's pretty clear that the studio tried way too hard to appeal to the fans of Mirai Nikki, both with its stupid moments happening while some serious stuff is going down (one of the girls got pregnant, because the MC touched her in the middle of a huge fight. Yes, you read that right), and dark themes dripping from every corner. Just like in the authors previous work, this combination does not work, as the stupid stuff overweighs the dark ones on a massive scale. I don't know how am I supposed to care, when there is so much ridiculousness thrown my way, without any reason or explanation.\\n\r\nYou see, the main appeal of this series, is that the setting is supposed to provide a lot of fun and be surprising. It kinda is at first, but while a few powers are severely overused, others are underused, or even left untouched. Eiji has the power to control everything in the area he claimed, in order to claim an area, he has to walk over it. However, there were times, where he didn't. His power sometimes exceeded that for some reason, so that's just great. This aside, his power is amazingly overpowered. He can command anything in his area, but he gets defeated so often, fails at most of the tasks he performs. How does one do that with this much power? This is probably the biggest mistakes I've ever seen in anime. If you're going to give a character this much power, and then make it so he fails so much, I'm pretty sure anyone can sense the bullshit with this idea. Of course this could be fixed by a simple limit, but why would you do that? That only requires more writing, and that can make your hands hurt right?\\n\r\nOh, and there's incest, but she's not his real sister so that's okay.\\n\r\nThere is so many more examples of this, but going over it would be require more time then I have at my disposal. Let's just say, that the story is bullshit with some cool ideas at first, and a pretty good plot twist once. The ending was also good, because it made all the things in the show irrelevant, so that makes forgetting it easier.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 5\\n\r\nThe show looks exactly like Mirai Nikki, but this was made 4 years after that. So many character designs are identical that the laziness of the people who created them is straight up annoying. I didn't have any major problems with it, but the CGI wasn't good, and there were some oversexualised characters, alongside some pretty obvious ripoffs, so the score is what it is. I just don't like it.\\n\r\nAs for animation, I didn't see anything bad with it, so it passes. There were even some pretty decently animated scenes here and there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 2\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself isn't bad, hell, I would even say it's good, but since we are talking about the anime, I feel like this score is justified. Why? Because it is misused so badly that I got mad at the music for the first time in my life.\\n\r\nSomething sad happens?\\n\r\nPut \"Dominate\" on!\\n\r\nSomething exciting happens?\\n\r\nPut \"Dominate\" on!\\n\r\nSomething that should make you contemplate happens?\\n\r\nPut fucking \"Dominate\" on!\\n\r\n\"Dominate\" feels like a jazz piece with all its trumpets. Would you want to hear that so frequently in so many different situations? It's not that bad, but it was played so often, and it was always so unfitting, that I started to hate it. That alone was enough to completely RUIN the music for me. I couldn't hear any other song playing because of that. I'm not even sure how many other songs played, because the only one I heard was this.\\n\r\nThis is not a 1 only because I truly like the opening, both on the visual side, and on the music side. Ending on the other hand pissed me off as much as \"Dominate\" did. It just didn't fit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nYou may find yourself liking some characters. I don't consider all of them completely atrocious, but I could only get myself to like three total. Eiji is an asshole to everybody, acts dumb (as I previously mentioned, he misuses his power to a stupid degree) and irresponsible. In the first episode we get introduced to a typical yandere, but this time, her main trait, and I repeat, MAIN TRAIT is that she's stupid. It is even deliberately stated in the show itself. That doesn't make her a better character btw. Eiji's power killed her family, but she falls in love with him because he accidentally uses his power to make her marry him. She hates him and tries to kill him the whole time, but she quickly decided that she loves him.\\n\r\nYAY! ROMANCE!\\n\r\nYAY! GOOD WRITING!\\n\r\nThe other orders aren't even worth mentioning, most of them either get almost no story (one does, I liked him), or never even get mentioned. Yes, some of them are left completely untouched or unseen throughout the entire story.\\n\r\nThe only characters that I thought were interesting were Eiji's sister (even with the incest), because she gets major development and some good plot twists surrounding her, and the main antagonist, whose motives were more rational then any of the other characters. I couldn't care less about the rest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nWhat is it that I enjoyed? One of the scenes, in which a stone giant stops a nuclear missile. That made me honestly think \"Hey, that's pretty cool\".\\n\r\nOther then that I forced myself to finish it, purely because of my completionist attitude. There was nothing, NOTHING that would make me want to push forward, other then the thought of being able to say that I watched a bad show afterwards. This was honeslty my firs experience with an anime that I disliked this much. I don't Hate it, I just dislike it immensely. I quickly forgot most of the story elements, purely because how uninteresting they were. I wouldn't be glad that I watched this show, if not for the fact that I wanted to watch a bad one, so I achieved that I guess.\\n\r\nBut at what cost.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nBetween this and Skelter Heaven, I would still rather sit through another 10 episodes of this to be honest. There were a few aspects that weren't completely ruined, a surprising plot twist and a character that I quite liked. The opening was also good.\\n\r\nBut that doesn't mean that I ever will rewatch this.\\n\r\nWatching bad anime makes you really appreciate your favourites. I've had enough of this for at least a few months though. I wrote this review to remeber the time lost on this.\\n\r\nPress F to pay respects for my lost time.\\n\r\nIf I ever see Sakae Esuno write something again, I'll be sure not to read or watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion, but I can't reccomend you to develop you own.\\n\r\nWatch at your own risk",

It started with the first two wishes \r\nArt: 3/10\r\n- I actually liked the character designs of the characters specially for Rin, Sena and Iyo.\r\n- Themes andSettings of scenes are designed well\\n\\n\r\nSound: 1/10\\n\r\n- Opening Soundtrack is a mess accompanied by repetitive artworks\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\n- Words are not enough to explain how horrible they are.\\n\r\n- Eiji is a total loser\\n\r\n- Rin initially hates Eiji but falls for him in succeeding episodes.\\n\r\n- Iyo likes Eiji. Wants to make a baby with him. \\n\r\n- Sena loves Eiji her half-brother so much. They made love in an episode\\n\r\n- Gennai the father of Sena and Eiji, is a researcher and a scientist.

One of the weirdest characters in this anime you will mostly see her pop out of nowhere floating upside down. Seeing her will make you have headaches.

It doesn't change the fact the story is still crap.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\n- This anime is full of shit, dull and boring.\\n\r\n- Very fast paced. \\n\r\n- A trainwreck. \\n\r\n- Supporting characters really don't help for the betterment of this anime.\\n\r\n- An Episode 5 full of fanservice. Not enough to save this anime.\\n\r\n- It's all about dominating the world for Sena's sake.\\n\r\n- At least the anime actually explained on why only a few select have The Power of the Order granted by Daisy. \\n\r\n- This anime should not be watched. I wish it never existed in the first place.\\n",

            "content": "Big Order is quite a big order to watch. A show that, by the end, made me toss my phone, wash my face, and put me in a state of nothingness to comprehend it\u2019s utter awfulness is a special one indeed. 1/10 is the score reserved for the shows that fail in every fundamental category of Story, Character, Sound, and Animation. Big Order not only achieves this, but qualifies with flying colors and is damn proud of it.  With everything that could possibly go wrong, Big Order turns failures to big failures.\r\nWhat It Does Right:\r\n+...\r\nWhat It Does Wrong (Besides it Existence):\r\n-Takes a Sample ofEvery Genre in Anime and Mutates It Horribly\\n\r\nCode Geass\u2019 rebellion to save his sister, Mirai Nikki\u2019s BS powers, to freaking JoJo\u2019s stands. Hmm let\u2019s add some \u201cincest\u201d to spice thing up, have a contest to see who has the most broken power, and make those \u201cstands\u201d as gorgeous as possible with the latest technology, CGI! Big Order takes one look at each show and butchers each one to the point of near parody. Big Order also tries it\u2019s hand at ecchi by info-dumping in the shower. Let\u2019s not forget some food reactions, let\u2019s shove that in that one important conversation I\u2019m sure no one's paying attention to. Oh yeah, harems are pretty popular these days, so let\u2019s take three female characters at random and make them fall for Edgy-kun. Who needs chemistry when we got MIND CONTROL.\\n\\n\r\n-Fight OP Powers With More Silly OP Powers\\n\r\nHe can control any physical material he walks on? Turn anything punched into atoms? Alter reality by turning it into a lie? Combine abilities through the ultimate power of love and harness the ability shoot fish at your opponent? Yes you\u2019re hearing that right. These are just a few of the many nonsensical powers or orders as they are called. I can barely wrap my head around half of these powers and I\u2019m pretty sure the writers didn't understand what they even came up with. Screw logic, no need for that. Seriously, there is absolutely no thought put into these powers and it\u2019s shown as the show covers up it\u2019s multitude of holes and conflicts with hax powers.\\n\\n\r\n-Exposition That Works as a Great Sleeping Pill\\n\r\nWhen Big Order isn\u2019t pissing around being as bombastically dumb as possible, it\u2019s slaps itself in the face and remembers that it has a plot to tell. How to tell that plot, the show seems to have no idea. Let\u2019s just take whatever is in the script, clump it together, and spout it out in the most mundane way possible. Info-dumping things the characters should already know, declaring mumbo-jumbo nonsense in the attempt to sound smart, discussing \u201cstrategies\u201d more complicated than it is when everything is just resolved through hax powers. The only thing worse than a bad show is a bad show that\u2019s boring. That\u2019s the kind that seriously test my patience.\\n\\n\r\n-Obnoxious Characters That Break Into the Negative Dimension\\n\r\nWe\u2019ll just call our fellow protagonist Eiji, Edgy-kun. How convenient. Edgelord extraordinaire, world-class harem lead, PHD in being a bloody buffoon, Edgy-kun meets all the requirements to called generic as all heck. We also got Yuno 2.0 in case you missed the yandere master race (god knows why). She wants to kill Edgy-kun, but can\u2019t cause hax powers gotta make her be part of the harem. We got a innocent shrine maiden who can predict the future and can get pregnant by touching her ribbon. Idk anymore, did I mention that Big Order wants to be a comedy too? There are too many other characters that I forgot about, but to my defense the show forgets about them too. Awkward reintroductions and lame gimmicks to remind us of random character #27328, nah I\u2019m good.\\n\\n\r\n-Rip Off Character Designs and LOL AT THAT CGI\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t watch Mirai Nikki, but even I could see the obvious comparisons. And wasn\u2019t that the guy from Jormungand? And obligatory sister character from that last show I saw? Selling your title by ripping off your own work is not okay. The animation is barely competent and feels just as lazy. It\u2019s hard to critique something that doesn\u2019t even try to break average. When the show tries to have style, it gets hella distracting as seen with the last episode being almost entirely black and white with hideous filters. And goodness gracious, the CGI is absolutely revolting. Each time I witness Edgy-Kun\u2019s \u201cstand\u201d and it\u2019s tentacle things has me bursting out in laughter by the utter stiffness and lifeless roar. The other \u201cstands\u201d (or orders actually) have equal CGI cringe and it was a blast seeing them all in plasticky PS1-esque action.\\n\\n\r\n-Terrible Soundtrack That\u2019s Beyond Unfitting\\n\r\nWorks like Baccano and Cowboy Bebop have used jazz to a snappy effect to reflect their equally wild shenanigans. Big Order, a show that I can only describe as bland, uses the same discount jazz in almost every scene and it\u2019s horrendous. I normally either like a soundtrack or forget it, but Big Order went the extra mile to make it as mind-bogglingly jarring as possible. One such example being the ending theme which starts off with a bizarre horror like vibe and for some reason is inserted in a scene where everything is supposed to be happy. As usual, I bursted out in laughter. The opening manages to fail spectacularly as well with ugly guitar riffs, messy techno bs that made me wonder if my phone was broken, and comes off as a discount Mirai Nikki opening.\\n\\n\r\nMy Pointless Enjoyment:\\n\r\nLike I said before, I can tolerate bad, but boring bad is something that begs me to put it in the drop bin. When the show tries to explain, it simply lost me. By the time the show got to the end, it woke me up again with the greatest deus ex machina of all time, A LITERAL DEUS EX MACHINA. Never mind how everything else is cheaply resolved. This and so many other golden moments has me giving Big Order a big round of applause. Bravo Big Order, a show that\u2019s at it best when it\u2019s nonsensical bs. As you can see, this is a show best enjoyed with some buddies for comedy night. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI tried hard to find any positives, but I really couldn\u2019t. Even then, I was actually going to give this show a 1.5/10 for the laughs until a certain bad pun came up at the end as predicted by a fellow friend of mine. Having witnessed a near title drop along with reminding me that this show really is bottom of the barrel dump has me awarding Big Order with a 1/10. \\n\\n\r\nPS: Feel free to comment on my review. I'm always up for advice so I can improve my reviewing skills. Thanks for reading!",

Also, I see people tying this show to Mirai Nikki, but to me it felt more like some chinese bootleg attempt at Jojo.  In fact, by the second episode you even get to see ZA WARUDO.  Except it's bad cg, and looks more like a failed attempt at making time wizard.\r\nNow why do I believe this show to be amazing?  I judge a show by how long itfeels.  The sooner an episode is over the more I know I was enjoying it.  Every single episode felt like 5 - 10 minutes due to how fast paced the show is.  You might spend time trying to piece together some overarching plot or character motivation, but that fluctuates depending on the scene.  Nothing that happens in this show matters for more than the scene that it's shown.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music fits perfectly in with everything, as I believe they go out of their way to find the most unfitting music for every occasion.  Nothing says dire death battle like smooth jazz.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Big Order is about watching a train wreck.  It's not good, but it is good because of that.  It really is just kinda like Jojo.  Don't think about it, just sit back and enjoy the hype.",

THE REVIEW IS MY OPINION AND HOW I SEE THE ANIME , IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT IT'S OKAY , YOU CAN JUST LEAVE AND DON'T READ ANYMORE. (There it's some to read)\r\nBig Order - one of the most anime who is certainly hated or disliked and loved or liked by many.\r\nI'm on possitive side , i love this anime very much actually \r\nI watched the OVA before and i wanted so much for this to air , i was so hype.\r\nBefore i will start this review i gotta say that this was myfavorite anime of this season , yeh you surprised ? well i readed manga as well , that is better of course.\\n\r\nStory: Ten years ago, a fairy by the name of Daisy appeared and asked the child Eiji Hoshimiya what his one and only wish was. Although his wish remains a mystery, the consequences were catastrophic. In an event called the \"Great Destruction,\" the world started to fall apart as everything collapsed and countless people died.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Eiji is a high school student whose only concern is his sick sister. He does not remember what he wished for; all that he remembers is that his wish caused the Great Destruction. In the years since that event, thousands of other people have also received abilities to make their heart's desire come true. These people called \"Orders\" are believed to be evil and are hated by the general public. However, some of these Orders are after Eiji's life in vengeance for those that he killed. Will Eiji be able to survive the numerous assassination attempts? And the biggest mystery of all: what did he wish for, and what were his intentions in wishing for something that caused so much desolation?\\n\r\ni give this a 8 , you surprised ? let me explain what i give this note ! \\n\r\nThe anime start very good , a protagonist who don't give much fuck , and care about his sister. you could say that is Lelouch V2 ? that was my first thought after episode 1 ! the thing is that these days there aren't many anime's these days like Order , Diary , Geass , Death Note n stuff. I appreciate these shows , original ideas. You name this a cliche ? well maybe isn't that good of course like Code Geass and Death Note , this is my review , i just love this anime. But i don't think is a cliche , the series is kinda good , there aren't much character deveploment but there is a lot of good actions and plot twist ! i kinda think it's more ok than to add a lot of past stuff like Naruto. \\n\r\nArt - I like the art very much , well done , there aren't much graphics that is good these days. I give it a 8\\n\r\nSound - i like the OST's and the OP&ED's very much , i give it a 10.\\n\r\nCharacters - Not much character deveploment and details but like i said is better to concentrate on present than the anime's like Naruto more with past , don't get the wrong idea i like Naruto but i don't like the Shippuden series. Eiji the protagonsit gives you a presence of Lelouch from Code Geass , very determined when it's about his sister and sometimes giving up ? you may name it a copy but there is also Light who wanted to change the world not for someone , but for the world itself, it's kinda nice to have protagonist like this sometimes right ? it's rare but it's awesome. I am truly disappointed that there are only 10 episode because the manga is long and they cut some scenes...but hey , the series itself it's good ! And now about his sister...well it's the typic sister who need to be protected by her brother and have some kind of illness. Kurenai Rin ? Hot damn psychopath , i like that she is determined and don't look much into past , her parents was killed but she still lives , she wished for it , not much people do that. The others you will not see much about them but some are interesting. I give it a 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment - i enjoyed this very much , i give it a 10.\\n\r\nOverall - 10 , maybe isn't that good but i like it that much , it's my opinion and my review\\n\r\nif you like anime's with protagonist who want to change the world and some plot twist then sir you will enjoy it more or less.",

            "content": "OOOOOOOOOOOOOH HERE WE GO. Before starting, i'm not a Sakae Esuno fanboy. I didn't think that Mirai Nikki was good, not even close. I prefer this, yeah.\r\nAnd, wait for the meme, wait for it, \"The Manga Is Better\"\r\n[Spoiler Alert]\r\nSorry for bad english doh.\r\nBig Order... so much potential for a 10, but nope, as i predicted, fuk ups.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe plot is preety much linear, Eiji causes destruction and he becomes the Shinji of the anime. Then he gets caught and has to be the \"King\" of the new nation, but he's weak af even if his Order is overpowered. Anyways, the story is good, not asperfect as the Manga, since it's a bit rushed in 10 episodes, and has one of the worst \"Battle vs God\" i have ever seen, in Episode 10. Even doh, it's a 10, it's good. The last scene, that feels rushed as the anime is a lot better than it seems, because even if it lasts 15 seconds, it's a perfect ending for a show. The OVA sets up perfectly the plot.\\n\r\nArt: Nothing exeptional, CGI isn't bad when used, the only thing that triggered me was Episode 10 that was kinda all grey for 10 minutes. Character design is ok, slightly different from the manga, for example Sena in the manga has longer hair, and they are orange, but the anime made her figure so childish. As i said in the OVA review, i prefer \"Not-Yuno-Gasai\" design rather than the original Yuno.\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe opening is perfect. OST is also good, and voice acting is more than good.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nYou know why it's 9? Because someone ruined it.\\n\r\nEiji: Good protagonist, he has good character developing (Right, Yuki?), his power is OP af but in someway he's too stupid to use it. He is likeable because everyone can see himself in Eiji, he's the good boy, but not too inteligent, and he has reactions and thought of a 15/16 years old guy, as it should be. He takes the faults of his sister for her good, but doesn't remember it.\\n\r\nSena: The other one with developing. She got left in a corner for 6 episodes, then comes out and make the anime even more strange. She's smart, creepy and a loli. What do you want more? For having 12 years she's not really beliavable, but it didn't feel bad when she was on the screen.\\n\r\nGennai: Biological father of Sena and Eiji,antagonist of the series, he's mad. His purposes weren't evil, they were wrong and drove him into madness. As shown in the Hiragi flashback, he was a good person, dedicated to science; maybe too much.\\n\r\nDaisy: Ok, why am i mentioning her? Well, she's important in the plot. Neeeh, she's just someone who appears to fix things when a dead point in the anime comes out.\\n\r\nHiragi: The only one of the Ten that is worth mentioning. His character has backstory, as he was a scientist in the Hoshimiya's lab. As of his actual state...meh, i kinda liked him.\\n\r\nRin: Seems to be a major character but nope (She's developed better in the manga doh). For shippers, she's the one who ends up with Eiji, don't worry.\\n\r\nIyo: So annoying. Her character was just a mix of stupidness and various sht.\\n\r\nTaria: Why am i mentioning her? Because she's one of the big reasons why this anime isn't a 10.\\n\r\nI hate this character, from the bottom of my heart. Let's talk a bit of the fanservice scene in Episode 5. Her comments were more creepy than producers imagined i guess, making the scene unsexy and not funny at all, that was a big mistake.\\n\r\nThe Ten: THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nCan't say that i didn't enjoyed this show, i marathoned it.\\n\r\nOverall: 9 (8,5 arranged to 9)\\n\r\nIt could be better. But someone had to fuck up.",

            "content": "Oh boy where to begin with this one...\r\nWell firstly would be the \"similarities\" to Mirai Nikki, Big Order is done by the same author, Sakae Esuno and LA put \"similarities\" in quotation marks as it really follows and fails the \"basics\" of Mirai Nikki, the easiest being Rin Kurenai voiced by Shiori Mikami being a poor-mans vers. to Yuno Gasai and Eiji Hoshimiya voiced by Masakazu Morita as Yukiteru Amano with all his denseness, heck there isn't really a death game held in this anime, it's more like world domination with the side of superpowered humans trying to assassinate Eiji.\r\nFrom that LA has some obviousproblems and some rare strengths to give Big Order.\\n\\n\r\nObvious problems include, very weak main characters overall across the board, Eiji if anything is a stand-in for Yukiteru but even dumber considering he's got the entire \"dense main male protagonist\" going pretty strong, LA calls Eiji dumb for the basic reasoning if his power is to dominate anything in his area, he can use his \"imagination\" to think up some very good ploys to cripple his opponent, instead he just makes the more difficult route into \"dominating\" and heck even the powers have some plot holes here and there, but that's a bit later. His motivations is a bit mixed for LA, LA gets he's doing all this for his sick little sister, but later on it becomes incestous but that a bit later. Rin almost feels like a storyboarded prototype of Yuno Gasai just without the detail and intrigue behind the character, her motivation contradicts her actions and sure she got dominated by Eiji (that sounded bit off) AND now CAN'T kill Eiji throughout the anime, she tries desperately to be Yuno Gasai but seriously with her motivations and actions being constant contradictions to one another and her CONSTANTLY spouting that she'll kill Eiji...and maybe marry him, it gets even worse when she CONSTANTLY switches sides to the side for her better benefit (or forced to due to the Order powers) but because there are higher powers other than Rin in the series, she quickly becomes more of a satellite character to the side she's on/betraying later than an actual main character with a presence in the plot, ultimately this is Yuno Gasai ver. \"GO BACK TO THE WRITING BOARD WITH HER\" and was very poorly executed. As for the other main cast of Eiji's Group of Ten (Great name, so if Eiji and Rin joins isn't it now Group of Twelve?), they just aren't fleshed enough for LA to care and just making them either plot devices or showing their power equals \"personality\", which becomes odd as the ONLY character LA managed to like was Mari Kunou voiced by Saori Hayami, the 9th Hand of Group of Ten but even her presence, power and personality was enough for LA to like her given her VERY little screentime...she's better than the REST of the cast that moves the plot forward!.\\n\\n\r\nThe character focus becomes bizarre and once again poorly executed when we get focus on Iyo voiced by Azusa Tadokoro a divination expert, the fourth hand of Group of Ten, she gains a plotline within the story but takes a bizarre turn due to her becoming pregnant if someone grabs her bunny ears ribbon and that someone becomes Eiji, she immediately becomes pregnant then in the next episode...the \"baby bump\" is GONE and effectively making her presences both bizarre and almost meaningless due to the gaping plot thread left dangling there (and yeah it's explained later that it was a future prediction of the pregnancy, but the anime DOESN'T TELL US THAT) and yeah she becomes infatuated by Eiji from this incident which doesn't help matters as Eiji loves \"LOVES his sister\" (not to mention it's MUTUAL on the other side)...so not Iyo or Rin are even competitors in this \"harem\"...ultimately making many of the minor main cast members bland or underdeveloped...they just come and go which was a shame as some of the minor cast members from Group of Ten were interesting and LA wouldn't have mind them being fleshed out as to how they came into the Group of Ten and whatnot (obvious ones LA wanted fleshed out were Mari and Benkei Narukami voiced by Fumihiko Tachiki). Ohh yeah the incest...ohh boy. Ok, LA is a person that does look into the while incest topic with some bold (\"anime\" not real-life there's a difference) expectations but this too was poorly handled and was just done with the mindset of \"incest for the sake of incest to be more controversial\", look LA looks at incest in two ways of \"success\", either make it a serious drama REALLY looking into the topic of incest like Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai or if your a comedy, poke fun at the topic but don't take it TOO seriously comedic or over the top ecchi, a nice balance of ecchi and harem incest comedy like Oniichan dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne! did it, guess what Big Order tried to do.........none of them!. \\n\\n\r\nOk with that out of the way, the Order powers, right, LA had with Big Order was again to go back to what LA was saying about the Order powers being all over the place, it's not told specifically and felt like it was more going along with just to get the plot moving forward, Eiji has UNlimited uses for his Order powers, yet he's either too stupid to get the easiest route in taking down an enemy or some new \"rule\" comes in to limit his powers...when he shouldn't of...\"HE CAN DOMINATE ANYTHING ON A WHIM\"...why can't the anime get this?...ohh right to move the plot forward quicker. Finally due to Big Order only having 10 episodes, it's to be expected that this anime rushes it completely and it does...but if anything LA will say that it keeps a \"constant rushed rate\" for the most part and yes that dampens characters development immensely. Wow that's alot of things wrong with Big Order...\\n\\n\r\nAnything \"good\"...like any tiny little speck of...well the animation is decent. No really the same studio who did Mirai Nikki, Asread did a pretty good job on the animation sans the CGI Jojo stand-ins, the animation backgrounding to character designs to the few battle scenes were pretty nicely handled. The CGI however is the only detriment to the animation, the most blatant and ugly being Eiji's Order avatar. The OP done by YUI was also pretty decent as well, it was catchy at best, but LA still liked it. Finally, as rushed as Big Order was it still kept some semblance of a plot to easily keep up with it, even with the constant betrayals, mind-games, tactical espionage missions and the grand scheme of the villain of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, well what with the majority of the voice cast had to work with, LA can't blame them for how they did overall, Masakazu Morita and especially Shiori Mikami being the worst off (Shiori Mikami's first yandere role and again given her material LA just knew she was trying). As for Misaki Kuno as Eiji's sister, well she was the most mixed for LA, as her \"little sister\" scthick was fine, until she goes into obssessed-evil sounding, it was one part grating, one part \"Misaki Kuno, LA knows your trying to sound evil with this material\". If there was a voice actor that was LA's favorite would oddly go to Hitomi Harada as Kagekiyo Tairano, it just felt like she was having so much fun voicing this eccentric walking-ecchi Order.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending, well LA was rather mixed by this ending as it had a few rare moments where it was good, emphasis on \"rare\", like the main cast coming to defeat a big menace (with the likes of Kagekiyo, Mari and Benkei) as well as the plot threads finally resolve itself (except the entire pregnant thing...that never comes up or heard again). Now what was wrong with this ending was that the major villain of this anime ultimately made a wishing granting \"gate\" and really Eiji's and Sena's motivations towards the ending...LA didn't give a shit, not only was the motivations incestuous to say the least, but the \"wishes\" granted to put the major plot threads together were either too convoluted or trying to be a ripoff vers. of the Holy Grail by skewing your wish...no seriously, going into to SPOILERS here, but LA is gonna say it, how can a simple wish like \"want our family to be happy\" turn into \"let's destroy the world\" and sure it was stated that Sena couldn't control her wish, but how can a simple wish just turn into what happened in the plot and yeah now it goes into Eiji's wish, sure he could finally control his Order power now 100% to have ANY wish granted, basically making him a GOD, but really in fighting the \"big menace aka. final boss\" of the anime, he took it down too easily. *SPOLERS END* Rin's involvement in the ending again felt even more disjointed as revelations to Rin about what really happen opened Rin's eyes...it was kinda too late, as LA just saw no chemistry with her to Eiji and obviously because of Eiji's incestuous relationship and goal to Sena...she was little but a plot device to the ending. Does LA even need to tell you this ending was rushed to no end?. Ultimately, due to the incestuous motivations of our main two leads, LA just didn't care and cared more about the survival of the minor characters more. Eiji can FINALLY be with his beloved.....good keep them together and far away from LA. LA did say this ending was mixed for LA...but honestly even with the good and bad points, the bad points made LA lead into Big Order from So-Bad It's Weirdly Awful to So-Bad it's Bad territories.\\n\\n\r\nLA more or less knew what LA was getting into watching Big Order and the rumors and expectations was what LA had imagined it became, only slightly worse.....a cluttered and rushed mess of ideas and characters all trying to get screentime in which 10 episodes let alone 12 wouldn't be enough to fix. On paper, the premise looks promising, but in execution is where Big Order utterly ruined itself. LA can safely say that Big Order belongs in the drenches of bad anime of Spring 2016 with Seisen Cerberus with Big Order as it's running partner.",

Honestly, you can find quite a few good points for this show as it does have some good comedic moments. BUT, holy fuck is there a lot of plot holes wtf. Don't watch it if you are looking for something good. I don't like this show mostly because the main character gasps all the time, and the entire plot is so badly written and rushed the whole time. I found enjoyment in the moments where the story slowed down and characters were justfunny, but then again I only found it funny because i was watching it with a friend. I did enjoy the ending. but even the ending made me so god damn confused. like why the does the MC want to stop whats going on? I literally couldn't wrap my head around why the MC wouldn't let the villian just do his thing. But the twist at the end gave me a \"oh shit didn't see that coming, oh wow cool thanks\". Whatever still bad.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, watch it with a friend or be prepared to be dumbfounded by the horrible plot holes, and the somewhat good twist in the end. But don't go in expecting something amazing as it does have quite the bad rating.",

            "content": "Sakae has a bizarre, messy mind. For all the flaws in Future Diary, it\u2019s a masterpiece. The low points \u2013 and there are many \u2013 are there because there\u2019s few anime like it. Future Diary had no main tradition to draw from, no main road to follow. A lot of great anime follow clear traditions, building on obvious flaws and emphasizing strengths. Even the abstract Serial Experiments Lain belongs warmly in pre-millenium tension art.\r\nIt\u2019s hard to decide whether Future Diary falls more on its good side. Expecting Big Order to fulfill that series\u2019 promise is silly, since there can never be another one like it.If the premise sounds familiar to you, you\u2019ll be disappointed. The structures aren\u2019t similar at all. Still, the little you can expect is that the anime will fail in a spectacular fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe crucial flaw in Big Order isn\u2019t the lacking characters or the plot. The bad traits of Future Diary are amplified, but at least they have the same energy that one had. The problem is that the core of the anime is generic. Remove the layers, the odd designs, the violence and the messy plot and you\u2019re left with some kind of a battle shounen about saving the world for this one person we love so much because we\u2019re related to them by blood.\\n\\n\r\nI never wanted to say this about a work by Sakae. Big Order is normal. Everything good about is just a cover on a generic story.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning is good enough. The power of Orders is close to be symbolic rather than battle skills. There\u2019s a little exploration about the nature of wills, how our wills are limited and they could even do something the concept of losing loved ones. Two characters get completely different wishes despite losing their family. The conflicting nature of wishes is addressed and by the time the antagonist is revealed, he\u2019s given some time to express himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design isn\u2019t as expressive, but Sakae still goes wild with it. There\u2019s a nun with bunny ears, a twintailed girl with a flower in hair, two long-haired dudes and a square guy. Everyone wears weird outfits and the design plays with body structure and size. Characters who appear for barely 10 minutes in the whole show get a memorable design.\\n\\n\r\nThe highlight of the show is DAISY, a bizarre creation that deserved a better anime or at least a cameo appearance in the revamp of Future Diay, whenever someone gets around to make it. That little touch of having her hang upside down adds a lot. It emphasizes the distance she views humanity from. Although she\u2019s meant to be a fairy who grants wishes, she\u2019s always distant and slightly cynical towards the whole thing. It gets nowhere, but every time she appears she injects some life.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, the most normal creations in the anime are the main characters. People who wanted a Future Diary copy were disappointed. In fact, it often feels like the anime tries too hard to distance itself from its big sister. Why is that? Future Diary is unique enough to be worth revisiting. If Sakae wants to do something new so much, why is he falling back on cliches?\\n\\n\r\nYukki/Yuno were deeply flawed human beings. People disliked them for their nature, but they missed the point. They were supposed to be imperfect. Everyone in that series was imperfect, was full of desires and selfishness. This gave them humanity and made it believable at its most surreal. Eiji is a likable guy who only wants to live happy with his sister, but he has no desires, no motivations whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s responsible for humanity\u2019s worst horror, and that concept of guilt is explored for a while but abandoned. Scenes showing how much everyone hates Eiji are that type of deep moments Sakae can conjure. How everyone gathers around televisions, how they wallow in their hatred for this one person is frightening. Even if he is that horrible, what about this hatred? It\u2019s the cult of anti-personality, and even if you think it doesn\u2019t exist just look at how everyone reacts to Trump or Hitler.\\n\\n\r\nSince Eiji is, at his heart, a generic moral hero who only wants to defend his loved ones this means nothing. His only drive in the series is protecting his sister and the guilt kind of drives him, but was it necessary? He\u2019d want to keep his sister safe even if he didn\u2019t cause a great destruction. We never see the psychological effect of guilt, of knowing everyone hates you. Occasionally there are hints Eiji is actually working alone, but that\u2019s never expanded upon. The whole \u2018one man and his sister against the world\u2019 could work even just as a fun show, but it never goes there. The guilt is just another element in the many tired speeches about protecting Sena.\\n\\n\r\nAs for her, she\u2019s an object. Everyone cares deeply about her happiness, but why? Her connection to Eiji is only by blood. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know how their relationship is. It simply doesn\u2019t exist. Whenever they interact, she\u2019s simply being cute and he\u2019s being nice. If her cuteness was integral, if that charm was emphasized, exaggerated and played with then fine. She\u2019s never portrayed as a character that captures people\u2019s heart. Rather, it\u2019s the lifeless trope of hapless girl who\u2019s convenient to rescue.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the few times we get insight into other characters, it always has to do with protecting loved ones. The Future Diary had the \u2018dark past\u2019 cliche, but at least each character had a slightly different past and reacted to it different. Characters may have different Orders, but they all wish they could\u2019ve rescued their friends or family and they don\u2019t gain different conclusions out of the loss.\\n\\n\r\nLoss is one of the worst experiences you can go through. If we all experienced in the same way though, it wouldn\u2019t be so harrowing. Misery loves company, and by listening to how others felt when their parents or friends or spouses died would\u2019ve helped us through. Loss is such a harrowing thing, and how you lose someone affects how you react to it. Big Order only plays with the emotional weight it has. It gives the characters a convenient excuse to do what they do. That\u2019s better than making them plain evil, but it\u2019s not enough to make them wholly human. They\u2019re not given motivations, but batteries in different colors.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing the show has going for it is Sakae\u2019s wild imagination. The little he had left was for wacky set-pieces. There are odd situations and turns all over the anime. Gates open to mental spaces, characters become pregnant by touching their ears, an obstacle course \u2013 somewhere here an incredibly fun anime is hiding. But Big Order doesn\u2019t have the conviction Future Diary had.\\n\\n\r\nThat one jumped from genre to genre, but it approached each with so much conviction you could create 10 seperate anime out of it. Big Order is more scared of becoming a clone, so it does away with anything resembling Thriller, chucks away most of the romance and piles on the action. There aren\u2019t many tonal shifts and doing away with the death game scenario looks silly with what you have left. If it concludes with people sacrificing themselves to make a non-character happy, what\u2019s the point?\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s energy and verve here, but Big Order is a mess without directions. Notice the use of plural form. If it was an amalgam of genres that didn\u2019t gel, it would be brave enough to be interesting. Instead, it\u2019s too scared of its big sister. So it pushes forward, one wacky set-piece after another. Without a core, or multiple ones to rely on all it has is cliches. This is a perfect examples of when tropes are a bad thing. The anime uses them only because it has nothing to say, because it\u2019s too afraid to explore its themes and too afraid to pile on the ideas. So yes, there\u2019s a Rock God and a pentagram of some sorts and gates and an upside down fairy, but it\u2019s just another story about protecting the little sister. Try BioShock instead.\\n\\n\r\n2.5 floating girls out of 5",

Today was also the day that all my illnesses were cured, you wanna know why, It\u2019s thanks to this show (Not in a good way). \r\nBig Order is a show that had so much potential, the first two episodes were quite well done, after that it just falls apart and I'm so sad that it does\u2026so much potential lost.\r\nCharacters 7/10\r\n\tBasic copies of Yuno Gasai..and Yukki + Incest (I\u2019ll get to that later). They were well believable during their \u201cemotional\u2019 scenes but\u2026other times not only were they one dimensional..but they were so bland that, actually you know what, I\u2019m done\u2026\u2026\u2026\r\nThis showwas not only the biggest piece of mediocre junk, it was an abomination. Lets me tell you what is wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\n#1. Characters \\n\r\n\tDo these characters have brains, I think not. Sometimes they base their decisions on the moment, without thinking making any logical decisions. If you have the power to control and manipulate people, why don\u2019t you use that to your ADVANTAGE, instead if \u201cfiguring it ot\u201d your own way. The main character, Eiji is so dumb that I just face palm when he does his \u201cemotional\u201d speeches about humanity and people hating him and that power of Orders..\\n\\n\r\n#2. The Story\\n\r\n\tThe first two episodes start off pretty good\u2026then it goes downhill. Let me tell you why:\\n\r\nOrders are people with special powers, Eiji\u2019s father created these orders and now Eiji has to stop him. Eiji also was the one who caused \u201cThe Great Destruction\u201d when actually it was his sister and now he has to save her form her father. That is the story. Eiji loves his sister..not plutonic but sexually. Eiji also falls in love with another girl names Iyo, who gets pregnant if you touch her ears\u2026.@_@..~_~. One episode they engage in sexual intercourse light beams block their \u201cprivate parts\u201d\u2026p.s. they are both under the age of 18\u2026.~_~.  I\u2019m done. In the end he saves everyone by killing his father and that\u2019s it. Show ends with him trying to get his sister a birthday present. Show's only 10 eps...what can you expect? \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m really tired right now, not planning to waste more time talking about this show. I really expected it to be somewhat good, coming from the studio behind Future Diary....but no..\\n\\n\r\nOh and also there is a bath scene where a girl fondles the breasts of other women and moans HEAVILY doing so. Of course beams of light block the fondling *cough*. \\n\\n\r\nSo in the end\u2026what do I give this show\u2026I had high hopes for it but..it was terrible.\\n\\n\r\nI really don\u2019t like watching bad anime..but this was \"out of the blue kind\" of bad.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga was one of the best this season (Not THE best..one of the best\u20261. Kabaneri 2. Joker Game 3. Aggressive Retsuko 4. Mayoiga (\u1597\u224b\u25be\u224b\u1598 Gabe Kun), so sad this show is one of the worst.\\n\\n\r\nI am going to give this show a 5/10\u2026.i feel so sad to give this show such a bad rating because now I have contributed to being a part of the \u201cI finished a bad anime\u201d club\u2026most of the shows I watch arnt bad....*cough reason I dropped Kizanaiver cough*\\n\\n\\n\r\nK bai now\\n\\n\r\nP.S.

Ok ok. enough will the self praise, and on to the review. This will not be a positive one.\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 3.5/10\r\nOne of the only positive parts about Big Order was the potential it had. When it came down to the actual thick and thin, it was really just another 'teenager given power can destroy the world' but despite this, the limitless potential for orders also had given the series limitless potential. Included in that potential though, was limitlesschances to screw up, and that's exactly what happened. The plot progresses so fast that 99% of the time you don't know what's happening or why they're even on a mission, it uses fanservice to hide plotholes, and worst of all, the ending was barely satisfactory. They try way too hard to make the series as 'cool' as possible, but since they'd screwed up so badly to begin with, this only made it worse.\\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nCalling this artwork bad would be an understatement. I think tragic is probably a more fitting word. I honestly think this aspect is inferior to Mirai Nikki, which was made by the same studio ALMOST FIVE YEARS PRIOR. SERIOUSLY?! I would have thought with the constantly enlarging computer technology would make animation better for every studio. It's almost like they had no idea what they were doing in the production stages and were forced to quickly animate the episodes a day before their release. Though it's not the worst from the season, it's still pathetic.\\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nJust barely becoming a positive aspect for Big Order is the sound. The opening, ending, voice acting and sound effects are all flat out average. Nothing special about them through and through. Thankfully for Big Order, it was blessed with a good soundtrack that made it possible to take the serious scenes seriously. If there wasn't a good soundtrack, it would have been impossible and I think that I probably would have been laughing instead of sighing every time Eji yelled. It's not much, but it helps.\\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest. This is where my bias comes in for shows. As long as they have one character I can relate to or like for some reason, I'll most likely like the show as long as every other part about it isn't completely bad. So I pay special attention to this category. I can tell you, the characters are heartbreakingly bad. The only character even worth mentioning is Kurenai Rin because the rest are just unfinished templates of characters that have no motives and no reason to even exist. Back to Rin, she is the mangaka's attempt to recreate the entire reason Mirai Nikki is popular. No actually, one of the reason's anime in general is popular. As the yandere queen, Yuno Gasai is probably the most famous anime female ever created. Kurenai Rin feels like a desperate attempt to recreate Yuno due to the recent yandere boom on the intemet. She fails spectacularly! She has one or two yandere moments but that's really it. She's closer to a tsundere than a yandere. There isn't a single good character in the entire show.\\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nBig Order only exists as a lackluster way to make more money off of Mirai Nikki. It almost makes me think that the author only made this to make Mirai Nikki look better. There is absolutely no reason to watch this, fan of Mirai Nikki or not.",

            "content": "Oh how do I describe Big Order? It is pretty much a garbage truck headed straight for the dump. It\u2019s absolutely horrible. Surprisingly, it isn\u2019t the worst of the season somehow\u2026 This anime in my opinion deserves it right to reside in the Anime Garden of Sinners along with other absolutely terrible series such as Chaos Dragon and Divine Gate. Yes, it is that bad. Now you may wonder how it was so bad? It had the writer of Mirai Nikki and the same studio that produced it. What went so horribly wrong? \r\nStory: 1/10\r\nJesus Christ was this story a mess. The basic plot isthat our Main Character, Eiji who looks exactly the same as Yuki but without the cap wished for something which caused the \u201cGreat Destruction.\u201d But here is one thing, they call it a great destruction, so shouldn\u2019t everything look ruined? Shouldn\u2019t there be only a few survivors? Shouldn\u2019t it be more post-apocalyptic? Nope, Big Order doesn\u2019t even know what it means by saying Great Destruction, it shows you a perfectly fine world with many people living, no building collapsed, and there is even SCHOOL going on. How does that make sense in something called the \u201cGreat Destruction?\u201d This therefore already breaks our reality on the story and this so called \u201cGreat Destruction.\u201d We can even tell this story has no confidence in itself with the absurdity that it has sometimes and the fan service. There are many uncomfortable topics in this series such as incest and sex. They really should put hentai on the genres of this series. The series pacing is all over the place and many events are things you will not care about. Not to mention the overall poor writing of the dialogue and scenario. Many things are also left unexplained and overall, this story was left in pieces by then end. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nHow do I describe Big Order\u2019s art? It\u2019s overall poor for a 2016 anime. Even anime that are worse than this show in this season have better art work. This makes Hundred\u2019s art looks like Leonardo Da Vinci painted it. Backgrounds don\u2019t look very good. The sky is for some reason green until the last episode; don\u2019t know who made that decision. Character designs are all generic and we have seen this before. They literally look the same as Mirai Nikki, just change the hair a little bit and heights too, then you have the characters of this series. Overall the art for this series was poor. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n\tIs there anything redeemable about the sound in the series? Well I can\u2019t really talk about it as I was so disgusted that I couldn\u2019t even listen to the sound. It\u2019s extremely forgettable. Huh, that\u2019s probably why I can\u2019t talk about it, because I forgot everything about the sound. That\u2019s how forgettable it is. The Opening and Endings are extremely bad too. Even though it sort of fits with Big Order, it really is a bad song on both ends. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\n\tHonestly the worst part of Big Order. I really hate every single character in this series. It\u2019s really hard to find a series where I actually hate every single character. Even in one of the worst series of all time, Chaos Dragon, I found a character that I actually liked. That really tells you that this show is bad. It really is never explained what motivations some of the characters have and it is a huge cast and trying to develop all of them in 10 episodes is impossible. Another good example of that is this season\u2019s Mayoiga. Dialogue between characters is poor and you really can\u2019t feel any emotion for any of the characters. Some are just introduced out of the blue and you are like \u201cWho are you?\u201d Character development is quite literally non-existent. Eiji for literally the entire series just says \u201cI\u2019m gonna save Sena!\u201d Literally every episode he just says that. It\u2019s quite literally the same with every other character in the series too. Rin is like \u201cI\u2019m going to kill Eiji,\u201d the fortune teller is just like \u201cI\u2019m going to make love to Eiji,\u201d and so on and so forth for literally every other character. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10 \\n\\n\r\n\tThis show is probably one of the most unenjoyable shows to watch. I literally had to drag myself to KissAnime and cringe at how bad this series was every Friday. A poor story with poor characters makes for an overall poor anime. I seriously considered just dropping the anime entirely as every episode felt really long and not worth watching. Completely the opposite vibe from a great show such as Re:Zero which wanted me to keep watching every episode and each one felt like 5 minutes long. A good way of saying how un-enjoyable this series was is saying it was like watching an episode of Endride or Divine Gate. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThis show is quite bad, but somehow was not the worst of the season. Yes, Spring 2016 had even worse series than this. The poor story, characters, and lack of enjoyment that it gives you really brought this show down to something like watching that live action Dragon Ball movie where everyone was white but the sensei. The art and sound of this series really did not help at all. It just kept dragging down everything about it. So is it worth watching Big Order? No and I hope that is abundantly clear by the paragraphs that explain everything that I hate about this show. I hope this review was helpful in convincing you not to watch Big Order. \\n",

The visuals are bland and characters have less personalities than your actual garbage.\r\nThe creators themselves don't know what they are doing with the anime. It is stated at first that special people get their wishes granted whatever they may be. That would be fine in itself but that's not how it goes. With each episode that premise is being torn apart. Later on it appears that instead they have powers that correspond to the wishes that they made before the apocalypse and not justthat, they also have to point their hands that activates a \"tattoo\" in their palm where they shoot out their powers from. A real far stretch from people getting their wishes granted.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't get me started about the apocalypse. It's one thing that it happened, it's another that the characters act like it was nothing. Human population doesn't seem to be affected at all by it, we still have ice cream stands and vending stalls, who the heck prioritises food trucks over medical/school or other important buildings to rule the country.\\n\\n\r\nIt even has a flipping BATH EPISODE, it's not even a full series and it has a god damn bath episode for fan service.\\n\\n\r\nI have made a video review of it that you can see on Youtube if you search for MudanTV Big Order Review. Any feedback would be appreciated :)",

All of humanity that is left hates him  (It takes him 5 episodes to realize that everyone hates his guts too) so much they even attempt to nuke him while he's in the middle of a city. His power is to control all things. Yet he didnt know his ability until 10 years later. An independant government uses him to retake control of japan even though hes taken control of them he feels the need to yell at them demanding to know what they are actually doing but he never uses his control powerto force them to spill it. His step-sister(who he bones(and that comes out of left field)) is sick and will die in X amount of time but he never thinks to use his ability to take control of her illness. (he can control gravity/ air/ people/ animals) Basically this story forces a big fat one up its own butt on the first episode because with its logic he should have been able to fix everything by episode 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nVivid and very colorful in some places. The character art style is pretty basic though.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMusic is forgettable and the sound is nothing special unless you like hearing a boy screaming pretty often. VA's do a good job here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOnly one character worth a damn is Rin Kurenai. She's very similar to Future diaries crazy girl and is the soul source of comedy in this anime. She can regenerate from anything. (including being killed)\\n\\n\r\nGuess i should talk about the MC, i forgot his name lets call him Leluch ripoff\\n\\n\r\nLeluch ripoff: So this kid tries to act smart and be cunning however in reality he's always 3 steps behind the people who control him(even though he's has actual control over them. He bones his step-sis and after Rin looses his Mind Control only then does he realize how much she hates him even though shes been trying to kill him since the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf it wasn't for Rin i would have stopped watching sooner then i did. There are so many plot holes in this anime you could turn it into swiss cheese.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDont watch this if plot holes annoy you. if you liked Future diaries crazy girl you can probably stand to watch this just to watch Rin.

The animation quality was good too. As of episode 5 I had this show rated as one of the top 5 shows of this season. Episode 6 came as a slap to the face. The studio must have had low ratings and said 'Who needs a cohesive storyline anymore when the show is about to be cancelled'' The constant changing of scenes and time skipping without any prelude was horrible. I can't believe they even allowedthis episode to air. The gratuitous 3 minutes of fanservice at the start that has nothing to do with the story, sure I can overlook that. Even the weird incest scene I can overlook because it's anime but don't put those scenes in if you're going to take out crucial scenes which would contribute to the solidarity of the story-telling. The show is now unwatchable for me.",

            "content": "Upon seeing the overall rating and predominantly negative and sarcastic reviews for Big Order I felt I had to offer a second opinion.  Obviously take what I'm saying with a grain of salt; most people did not like this show and going by the statistics you probably won't like it either.  However, I enjoyed it and I'd like to highlight what I thought were the positive aspects of the show so that people like me won't simply overlook it due to the abundance of 'bad' reviews and the atrociously low average rating.\r\nBig Order does not give a damn.  It does not careabout presenting a thoughtful and compelling story, it does not seek to enlighten the audience about some facet of human nature, and it does not make any effort to move anime forward as an artistic medium.  Instead this is an anime about punching nuclear missiles and saving the world - or maybe just your sister, I don't even remember - by jumping through one absurd plot hoop after another.\\n\\n\r\nThank God.  If this show had restrained itself by trying to conform to any expectation of sanity or traditionally defined 'quality' it would not have been as absurdly, ridiculously enjoyable as it was.  It's difficult for me to explain this without using specific examples and I don't want to do that because knowing what happens beforehand takes some of the excitement away.  Suffice to say that after a few episodes I was excited to see what would happen next because the show had taught me to expect anything.  And I mean ANYTHING.\\n\\n\r\nThe level of blissful stupidity probably peaked somewhere around episode five, or slightly before it - one scene from relatively early on stands out above all the rest and the early episodes contain several other highlights - but it continued to deliver in crazy, over-the-top moments all the way through to the end.  These moments are why the show is worth watching, and if this sounds to you like I'm just using positive terms to describe \"plot holes\" or some other form of \"bad writing\" then you probably won't enjoy Big Order.\\n\\n\r\nSome elements from the Big Order may seem a little bit familiar - the Orders are basically Stands, and an important scene near the end was strangely similar to a scene from Code Geass.  The use of the powers is also somewhat arbitrary and not always clearly explained.  Such problems did not significantly detract from the show as they did not interrupt or take away from its' intensity, but they are definite weaknesses.  Another weakness was the characters - though the things they did were often memorable, I didn't particularly care about any of them or think any of them stood out.  Nonetheless, this is a type of show I enjoy watching, and I would love to see something like this with more appealing characters and a stupid plot that was a better form of the same stupidity, if that makes any sense.\\n\\n\r\nMore traditionally positive is the show's opening theme - I thought it was the best out of every show I watched in Spring 2016.",

Anyways check it out and see for yourself if like it. \r\nThe story is the best point of this series; it's entertaining and leaves you wanting to know whats it's going to happen next and how it's going to end and because of that it's worth watching. Things explained below that are somewhat lackluster is what doesn't make this a great anime but it's still an anime that I think it's worth watchingif you want to experience an interesting story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is not the best but it's there when it needs to be. Is not deep enough to really feel with the character but in this case there is a guy on a mission and all that is related to that that needs to be explained is explained so you can understand why he is doing what he is and why other do to him what they do.\\n\\n\r\nSome stuff might seem odd a bit at first but near the end information is reveled that make the important parts of the plot come together but don't worry is not all like that just some questions that make some stuff seem odd at first but then you understand why it was that way. There might be still things not explained if you go too deep but what really needs to be explained it's explained.\\n\\n\r\nI don't see anything wrong with the art. The only thing that might bother you are the \"order's\" appearance that is made with 3dcgi which looks bad but compared with other 3dcgi it's ok.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding this anime containing deus ex machina moments: Whatever happens happens in the laws of the fictional world what would be bad would be that the rules they created for the world would be broken by the characters for the convenience of the plot but that's not the case and it's not like some crazy out of the blue stuff happens here IMO. There are some things that are not known that are revealed as you go that save him on the first episodes and then there are ways to use his powers and other's powers that are different than the way they use them at first but it's like you have a spoon and you need to cut food you use the spoon differently to reach your goal. It's nothing that should be shamed as a flaw on any anime IMO.\\n\\n\r\n **micro spoilers** \\n\r\nThe only thing that I felt that might come out too much out of the blue was the \"fusion\" thing but I don't think that it's something so unimaginable or impossible in that world. All the other stuff seems to fall into the rules the anime set for itself like all the fictional works do.\\n\r\n **/micro spoilers**",

            "content": "You know, I really am not even sure where to begin on this anime. After watching the final episode I'm left feeling really disappointed and confused...\r\nThroughout this anime, it was very entertaining and fun to watch. The character development was really well done, the drama between characters was a good touch without turning the entire anime in to some stupid soap opera. Yes, there's quite a bit of fan service which I hate in anime, but it surprisingly did not bother me, because it actually made sense to the character development.\r\nWith that said, the development of the characters was astounding considering there were only 10episodes to this anime. One of the things I am disappointed about this anime, is how short it was. It made this anime feel rushed. There was just way too much missing in the middle of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's break this down section by section to see if I can put a finger on what I liked and disliked about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nPros: The anime had a great base story line. The character development was fantastic for such a short anime, and I enjoyed the 1st 9 episodes a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCons: The ending was rushed, there was a huge lack of content before the ending it felt like, and there was a bit too many sex based scenes.\\n\\n\r\nStory: At the very start of this anime, it felt like \"this is a Code Geass knock off\". The first couple episodes with the main character ordering people to obey him, I just felt \"this is Lelouch all over again.\" With that said, I wouldn't say this is necessarily a bad thing, as I loved Code Geass. The story jumped straight in to action with the kidnapping of Eiji's sister, forcing him to be \"king\" and immediately going to war. There was a lot of action to the anime throughout it, which is what made it so enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Personally, I cannot watch anime that look like they were drawn with colored pencils. If it has good art/animation I'll tend to watch at least some of almost any anime. That said, there was great art and animation to this anime. Smooth and fluent movement of the scenery and characters and not bad to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The only thing I ever really pay attention to in sound, is the voice acting. Nobody had an obnoxious voice, so I have to say the sound was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: As for the individual characters, there were a lot of positives and a lot of negatives to this. The main few characters had great development as I mentioned before. Although due to the rushed 10 episode anime, the supporting characters were really left in the back ground on this anime. There were some characters that were easy to like and some that were easy to hate. I think that's a good thing sometimes though when there's a mix of likable and hateable chatacters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I want to say hey this was one of the most enjoyable animes out there. It had so much potential based on the first 9 episodes. Sadly however the enjoyment was just sucked away with the ending. I mean, if the ending was episode 24, with content to fill in the void that this anime left me feeling like I missed half of the episodes, then yea it would be a great ending... But because of being so rushed I just feel like the enjoyment was sucked away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can only rate this anime as a 4. The more I think about it, the more disappointed and confused I become about this anime.",

            "content": "This series sums up why I dropped Future Diary after 12 episodes. Rin? Not feeling her or her need to verbalize her desire to kill our main character Eiji every episode. Eiji is just as one dimensional with his I must save my sister schtick. That's minor compared my other issue of the wishes. This is a clever and interesting means of having people with super powers battle other people with super powers. But that's what it becomes. While powers like telepathy, telekinesis, teleportation, domination, clairvoyance and immortality make sense several others in this series don't (I get the One Punch Man thing but stilla giant stone golem?). Maybe I was expecting something more of a psychological battle like Death Note or something more subtle like Bakemonogatari. What I got was an even more pointless version of Future Diary. At least in Future Diary they were motivated to kill each other. In Big Order it seems like the curved line to super powered battles. But there's one other thing I wanna knock this series for. Eiji's \"order\" and it's inconsistencies; stops ICBM with air pressure, can't stop a girl with a knife. Couldn't he just dominate every single person he encountered until he ruled the world? At least Japan? It would solve his everybody knows he destroyed the world problem. It's like he's all powerful but has never heard those words before so he makes it up as he goes along. So many scenarios where one would assume he could simply dominate his way out of and deus ex machina shows up. I'll give it high marks in every other category, the art is great the sound is good but the characters and story were just mediocre. And those are the two most important categories to me. Luckily it's only ten episodes, because anymore would have felt like torture\\n",

            "content": "Big Order had some brilliant ideas and so much potential, but in the end, it just couldn't live up to it.\r\nStory:\r\nBig Order's story at it's core, has everything you would need to make a great anime. But with only 10 episodes and since some of them feels like a fillers rather than anything else, it just couldn't deliver it. So it just feels rushed and ideas are picked and dropped like flies. More than that, many plot point are forgotten just after they happen and characters, especially the main character seems to keep forgetting his power when it would be most useful.\r\nArt & Sound:\r\nArt isgood and sound is not bad either. But there is really nothing that stands out. Some of the concepts used would be better if they were executed properly, but unfortunately they weren't and some of it turned out to be annoying in the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere isn't much character development to talk about. (well, two of the characters developed a bit, but in the end they were still shallow.) While some characters are decent enough, others seem quite shallow and some of them outright ridiculous. Their motivations are all weird as well. They seem to change what they want and their motivations or rather keep forgetting them every next second. Main character seems to suffer the worst from this but that's not the worst example, like I have said, there are only two interesting characters in this anime who gets some level of development and this ruins them as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt really isn't terrible as some would suggest. I really enjoyed some moments of it. It certainly isn't great, but it could be considered something to watch if you have some time to kill and nothing better to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWhile it isn't as terrible as some would suggest, it certainly is mediocre because of its wasted potential and how disappointing it was. It has very little rewatch value and while it had some sort of happy ending, that was disappointing as well. In the end, this anime is flawed at the core.",

            "content": "This might be the worst anime I've ever completed.\r\nI'll start off by saying that one reason I started this anime was because I learned it was based off of a manga done by the same author who wrote Future Diary/Mirai Nikki. That show was one I found rather enjoyable, so I gave this a watch. In Deus' name, I was wrong. This show starts off promising with the first couple of episodes, but it begins going downhill by the third episode and launches itself off a cliff entirely by the seventh episode or so.\r\nLet's start off with the characters. They're some of the worst. Onlya couple have a discernible personality, and this is out of a rather large cast. Few of them are memorable, and some of those few are memorable for the wrong reasons (there is a man whose head resembles a 2 x 4 piece of wood; he falls on the wrong side of memorable). The main character is an idiot. He has few, if any, redeeming qualities to him, and no matter what good he does, he goes out and does something mind-bendingly stupid to undo it all. His sister may be worse as a character, but I'll leave that for you to decide. \\n\\n\r\nBig Order's story started off rather interesting, but it only took four episodes for me to lose interest. By the fifth or sixth episode, I just watched it for some of the \"so bad, it's good\" moments here and there. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of those scenes, but most of the show is \"so bad, it's bad\". It becomes confusing and dull. Powers that the characters can use are often neutralized in the most convenient manners. Some are so specific it's almost funny. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has a few saving graces. Its first and second episode are rather good, and the music provides a great soundtrack (that, rather often, feels out of place; jazz doesn't make the best music when fighting stone titans). Visually, there's nothing that bad, unless you're not a fan of poorly proportionate breasts. Rin makes a good character\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there is almost no reason to watch this show. The enjoyable moments are few and far between. If you want something that occasionally swings into the territory of Ed Wood or Tommy Wiseau, you may find some enjoyment here. Just don't go in expecting something with actual potential. I did, and it turned into something proved to be the worst anime I've ever finished. Mercifully, it's ten episodes long only, so if you want to join in this horror show, it won't take you too long.",

The reviews are blown way out of proportions. The show is just slightly fast-paced.\r\nStory:\r\nSo, there's this dude named Eiji who made a wish to a chick named Daisy and practically killed a lot of people. Whew. As a result of his wish, Eiji also gained a power named Stand- I mean, Order, which allows him to control the people in his domain. As with every tragic main character, he has a sick sister that works asa MacGuffin for the hijinks that ensue. Also, she gets literally fucked. Go figure.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other dudes who are not named Eiji that also have powers called Orders. They make a fun club named Biggu Ooda. Their objective? To prank the whole world.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this, who knows what the fuck is even going on. They fight with each other, fight with big rocks, fight with nuclear warheads, get girls pregnant by touching their ears, a sad cactus, ass-pull power-ups, balls, pacts are formed and broken... It is truly beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nA very pretty PowerPoint show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI think I heard something.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is where Big Smoke's Order shines. So many deep and complex personalities clash in this series, it's impossible to keep track of any of their names. Thankfully, you don't need to. They are shouted every time a conversation is struck between two parties. \\n\\n\r\nTell me another series where a scuba diver is a serious threat to our main character and his buddies? Yeah, that's right. Naruto. But besides that, no other franchise has done this so well.\\n\\n\r\nEiji is a bottom bitch for the long white-haired dude. There's obviously the Yuno clone, a side hoe, Mohammad Avdol with a far better Stand and a bunch of other funny looking friends in the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI have no idea why, but this ridiculous shitfest was entertaining. Half the time I was baffled, wondering how the \"heroes\" got into this situation and half of it I admired that they managed to steal scenes from lots of other shows.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Eiji is my favorite JoJo.",

Sadly shortly after character introductions are made, the story takes a turn for the worst. \r\nWith the general, if not cliche', gist of Big Order being that the main character was granted an immense supernatural power at a young age and was not able to fully control it thus altering the world as we know it. Also through in an adorable little sister, a crazy chick out to kill youand marry you, and a slew of mysterious people with a hidden agenda. - Wonderful premise right?\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in the last stretch of the anime, production is rushed and story is compiled together hastily, only covering all the key points needed with little to no transition that makes any plausible sense. Its only saving grace is that it ends this clustered chaos on a high note that almost makes the previous two hours of the show bearable.",

The is a whole mess. Its fun to watch because of the points stated above, but it just doesnt work how it could.\r\nEverything after episode 3 seems rushed. Some developments and character choices just didnt make any sense at any given moment. The original ending is overall stupid. Instead of just adapting whats on manga, they decided to make their own thing and its horrible. You keep watching, hoping thateventually one episode will glue all the pieces together, but it doesnt. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime would have needed at least 26 episodes to properly develop itself. But I guess our japanese friends were too desperate to jump on the \"omg its another creation from the mirai nikki author\" train and did this mess.\\n\\n\r\nDont hope for a second season. Your best hope is for an eventual remake in a couple years, hpefully it shall properly adapt the manga.",

I wish it had ended like that, because I want to live in a world without Big Order.\r\nWhile not the worst show I've ever watched, it is an uncomfortably close second. Every aspect of this show is bad. The premise is Code Geass by way of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure in which you take the worst aspects of both shows and synthesize them into a construct of raw human suffering.\r\nBig Order is terrible enough that I am forced to question whetheror not Mirai Nikki was some sort of happy accident, a cosmic coincidence where the stars aligned in such a way as to permit a work of quality to emerge fully formed.\\n\\n\r\nThere are numerous moments in Big Order that I feel are meant to be constructed like the climax of a particularly well-designed mini-arc in JoJo. The moments feel like they should be cool and perhaps would be, were the show any good. There are a scant few good ideas hidden among the rubble of my destroyed respect for Sakae Esuno.\\n\\n\r\nThings this show treats as normal, perhaps even good, and sometimes as a joke: Incest. Handcuffing someone to a bed so you can force them to impregnate you. Blackmail. Murder, so long as you were made really sad by something that person did to you.\\n\\n\r\nI want to summarize the plot, but it's incoherent at best and baffling at worst.\\n\\n\r\nThere are actual, severe and noticeable problems with how the shots are composed and how the show is edited together. The animation is mostly fine, with no hilarious or aggressively terrible mistakes, but does nothing special. There are a number of sequences, especially toward the end, where they are absolutely attempting to be artistic in their presentation, but just comes off as lazy or confusing. There is a long sequence during the final episode in which everything is in black and white with a heavy filter overlay that seemed like it hoped to mimic the final scene of Gunbuster, bringing color to the world in one glorious moment, but forgot to actually build up to make that a meaningful transition.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the music is good. I like the track that plays over the episode preview, but I suspect I was just happy to hear that tune because it meant the episode was over.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing about this show is that it's 10 episodes long instead of 12 or 13.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not even enjoyably bad enough to drink to with friends. If you want something that's entertaining in its incompetence, I'd suggest Mayoiga.\\n\\n\r\nI would rate this show a 0/10 if that were an option. There is no merit here, no enjoyment to be had. The world would be a better place if this show did not exist.",

I'm going to try to keep this review spoiler free, although for anyone who is interested in this show, I can tell you right now that you are better off saving your time.\r\nStory: 3\r\nAfter finishing the anime, I am still a little confused about what the main plot was supposed to be. It seemed to start outas one thing, deteriorate into a jumbled mess, then reform into something completely different in a rush at the end. There were bits and pieces of plot points that seemed to hint at a plot which could have been great, but none of those are expanded upon or used at all really. they simply exist in the back ground as the anime takes wrong turn after wrong turn.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe art and character designs were solid enough, if annoying similar to the authors other, more well known work that is Mirai Nikki. The animation is solid enough, but the ED is one of the worst i have ever seen. It's as if they just didn't want to animate the ED, so just left it the way it was. The censoring was enough by itself to drop the art by an entire point as well.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, half of the last episode is portrayed through some kind of grey filter that is terrible.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\n Nothing about the sound track is memorable, besides maybe how much the ED doesn't fit the mood of the anime at all. The voice acting is alright, but mostly its just average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is completely devoid of character development in any way that makes sense. The main characters motivations are questionable (I can't say what, because spoiler) and he is pretty much personalityless without them, Rin is just a copy/paste of Yuno, minus some of the crazy, and none of the side characters get enough attention to become anyone you could even start to care about. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\\n\r\nI dropped this show after the first episode. I gave it another try a few weeks later, and dropped it again at episode 7. After the show ended, I forced myself to finish it. I think the worst thing about this anime is having to see all of it's potential, then watch as it gets pissed down the drain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, this anime was a mess of missed opportunities and wasted potential fused with cardboard characters and unnecessary (and unnecessarily censored) fan service. It was a few moments where it could have revived itself, but it chose to let itself die on the operating table. I would not recommend this anime to anyone.",

Standard, but more or less solid characters, an ok plot, good art... What could go wrong? Well, at first, it seems like a formula to a fail proof anime with a score of 6-8/10. And that's just how it was progressing.. However, somewhere about half way in, everything went to shit. How or why this happened i am still not quite sure, maybe it was the pretty much forced involvement of 2 more romantic relationships aside the initial one (oneof them incestuous, but not really since Sena is his step sister), or maybe it was the fact that this short 10 episode anime kept introducing new characters, even though it introduced more than enough already for such a short title...\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, at that point about half way in, it started failing, and failing hard, something that it kept doing until the end (that by the way felt really rushed, like the two episodes before it). If i where to rate the two halfs separately, i'd probably give the first one 7/10 and the second 3/10, but since i can't, i'm giving it a total of 5/10. I could probably go into deep analysis of the characters and plot, but... I don't think its worth my, or your time, so let's leave it at what i said, and add that aside the art, and maybe first few episodes, there's not much good to say about this anime, therefor my final verdict - do not watch it, its probably not worth your time.",

But before let 's see the good point of this show.\r\nFirstable it's mostly like the manga in the art and the general ambiances and story even if there is some flaws and diff\u00e9rences  that i will speek of later. Then i like the opening that i think suit well to the series; I dont rememberof the other ost but it never sound bad for me.Finally the 3 firt episode were well done\\n\\n\r\nFor me the biggest flaw of this show is the realisation. I understand that there wasn ' budget nor time for this and i think the studio tried to do a good thing but it didnt worked out.At the end of the 6 first \u00e9pisodes i always had a feeling that Something is missing as every victories of the protagonists seem plot-guided(but this can be the manga fault thought).Then in the last part of the series this feeliing parly disapeared but the didn't stop to make the show look ridiculous.I wont talk of the end that i think is interesting but i think that it could have been better if better explained and less rushed. Yes rushed : if the general flow of events is llike the manga(except the fact than the manga does not end and some minor or medium changes and cuts), everything is too short or bad cuted. The characters evolution also seem to be too fast (again it's half the anime fault, the manga also do it to a certain degree): i talk about espiecally about kurenai rin and the MC: both of them do or think things that don t have any sense.\\n\\n\r\nHowever this general crazyness and nonsense is also a part of the show charm and while i enjoyed it i onlly can point out the flaws.\\n\\n\r\nYou can Watch it as an inentantional comedy or like a story about the desires and the haate(i point out the public hate for the MC and the philosophy behind order power) but dont expet a masterpiece. I highly recomend you to read the manga than i think better than is adaptation",

I'll tell you why further below;\r\nSTORY: 3/10 \r\nThe story can be effectively summed up like this: ''Woah. Huh. Uhhhm... Eh...? Eeeehhhh... Ugh... UuuuUUuUUUGHHHH.'' \r\nDid you understand it? No? Yeah, me neither, because the story is all over the place --Due to being only 10 episodes long, from episode 2 onward, the story isrushed to ridiculous extents, giving almost no time for the viewer to process just what the hell is going on and leaving no space for proper world-building.\\n\\n\r\nAround halfway through the whole thing you're more likely than not to drop the show because at this point it's evident than even the plot itself doesn't know where to go. This is due to the introduction of short subplots that contribute very little to the story because they were dropped so quickly. And yeah, these chunks of story are introduced as suddenly as they are thrown into the trash can. It's almost as if the writers forgot that they only had 10 episodes to wrap up the whole thing, when they had already taken their sweet time to build up the first half one of these ''side quests'', so they decided to rush the second half and get back onto the main plotline. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is full of all kinds of asspulls; for example (minor Spoilers ahead), there's this one time where Hoshimiya Eiji --our beloved protagonist, is being attacked while he's underwater by no less than an elder Aquaman-wannabe and his Order, Elementor. Thing is, he needs to counterattack before he runs out of air. His magnificent strategy? Control the fishes nearby and literally throw them at his attacker. And yes, it works. And yes, this anime is meant to be taken seriously, somehow. There are many, many more, but I'm too lazy to write all of them.\\n\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\r\nIt's okay. The colors are somewhat generic but pleasant to the eye and the backgrounds have a fair amount of detail put into. It's got more or less the same art style and character design as Mirai Nikki but with more washed out colors. There are three things, however, that really put me off about this show's visuals; \\n\\n\r\nFIRST: generally choppy animation. \\n\r\nI'd even go as far as saying that series like Dragon Ball and One Piece have a far more solid animation than Big Order's, and we're comparing long-running shounens with a /10-episode series/.\\n\\n\r\nSECOND... sigh: CGI. \\n\r\nAlright, alright, not /all/ anime fail miserably at it, but the use of CGI on the industry of Japanese animation has gained the popularity of being a pretty hit-or-miss move. In Big Order's case, it's a lost swing. The models' movements are unnaturally stiff, and it doesn't help that the models themselves look like they were done in an hour or so. \\n\\n\r\nTHIRD... SIIIIIIGH: EXTREME censorship. \\n\r\nOn the second episode, we get to see Kurenai Rin-- one of the main characters of the series, grope and then literally /squeeze/ Eiji's balls. On the fourth episode, we're introduced to Heavy Rockstar --the brown-skinned beauty on the cover of the show with huge, juicy tits bouncing around for your viewing pleasure. The following episode's where the problem really shines --Literally. \\n\\n\r\nFrom this point on, expect huge, and I mean HUGE beams of light to cover a character's naked body. It's like the director said ''Gentlemen, at this point it's obvious that nobody's going to buy the Bluray version for shit unless we thrown in even more fanservice, but just to be sure, we'll cover /all/ of the skinny bits so that the thirsty members of our audience buy our garbage series! GENIE ASS!!!''\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 5/10\\n\r\nFor the most part, pretty mediocre. I've got to say, though, I found myself repeating the opening theme for a while. The ending theme, while not nearly as memorable, has a nice tune and fits the atmosphere of the show. \\n\r\nNow, let's stop for a second. I want you to picture someone getting back-stabbed while ''I Love You, You Love Me'' is playing in the distance. That's more or less how 70% of Big Order's ''dramatic'' scenes play out. There's this one cheesy-as-fuck jazz track that, while kinda catchy, is guaranteed to turn any intended-to-be serious moment into a cheesy 90s action show scene.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nDo not expect much character development from nearly anyone here, nor any sort of redeemable backstory --out of all the 15+ characters the series has, only Eiji, Sena, Rin, Iyo and a few others, actually have some sort explanation to as of why are they doing what they're doing. Other than that, everyone else just seems to be there because the plot demands them to do so. \\n\\n\r\nNote: Heavy Rockstar doesn't actually do much for plot progression, despite being in the show's poster. It's kind of like what happened with Sonic in Wreck-It-Ralph. She's probably just there so that you'd stare at her tits and consider watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I'll give to both the show and the manga is that the character designs are actually pretty damn good. Not only that, but there actually was some potential for most of the characters to be pretty interesting and likeable, but the show once again played himself like a horny teenager and let out a hot, sticky load of wasted potential.  \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:  5/10\\n\\n\r\nPretty sure most of my enjoyment was because of how laughably bad this got at times. The subpar writing, lazy animation and poor sound choice all make it a true challenge to take the show seriously. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI wholeheartedly recommend you to stay away from this anime. Even if you turn your brain off, I think there's other stuff out there more worth your time. Instead, I recommend you to check out Mirai Nikki if you haven't already. It's not a masterpiece by any means, mind you, but at least doesn't insult your intelligence nearly as much as Big Order does.\\n\\n",

It was incredibly fast paced which resulted in it being kind of all over the place (sometimes even literylly)\\n\\n\r\nFinal summary the anime it self was decent it had it's bad parts as well as some good ones so in the end from me it gets 6 out of 10 (if I could I'd give it a ittle less but not a round 5)",

Seriously.\r\nI really wanted to like this anime, but within the first few episodes you get the feeling its going to go downhill real quick. Even with his power restricted, the main character Eiji is basically Leleouch from Code Geass  in god form on steroids, yet hes completely worthless. He can bend ANYONE to his will, he can even bend matter itself to his will. I would have much preferred an MC that can just stomp anyone from existence than what we got with Eijiwho struggles to beat a rock.\\n\\n\r\nI might have made the mistake of comparing Eiji and Leleouch too much, but they do have 2 striking similarities. They both have a power that can bend the will of anyone they come across, and they both want to make a better world for their sister.\\n\r\nHow in the hell that leads Eiji *spoiler* to fucking his sister is beyond me. No build up, no explanation, it just happens. Incest is randomly thrown into the story...because...???. Incest in anime is whatever to me, I dont care if its there or not, but to just rocket launch it at our faces for no discernible reason is mental.\\n\\n\r\nThese are the 2 major problems that utterly destroyed this anime for me.",

            "content": "TL;DR: If you're interested in this because you liked Mirai Nikki, read the manga first. The anime makes very little sense if you haven't read the manga first, sadly.\r\nI really wanted to enjoy this anime because I loved Mirai Nikki and I had already read the manga. It was immediately alarming however that this was a 10 episode anime, as the manga had a lot of material. The only way this would work would be if this was a season 1 that covered the first part of the manga, but alas, that was not the case.\r\nIt is apparent to anyone who has read the mangathat in order to fit everything into 10 episodes they cut everything they didn't deem 100% necessary for plot progression, such as explanations for the characters' powers and character development, which is why it feels like things are going too fast, there's just no downtime. They even cut 2 entire arcs for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nI could forgive all of this, honestly, but they didn't even freaking manage that either - the anime ends at the end of the manga's part 1.\\n\\n\r\nThis next section will contain spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nManga readers already know who the characters are, how their powers work, the reasons behind some of the things that happen that were never explained due to a lack of time, etc, so it was passable to us - despite being an enormous clusterfuck to everyone else, of course.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really can't be forgiven though is that despite all of the sacrifices they made, essentially turning the anime into a very long \"last time on Big Order...\" sequence that makes no sense by itself, they still failed with completing the story in those 10 episodes and went with the oh-so-hated choice of an anime-exclusive ending, finishing the story at chapter 32 - and the manga goes on for another 16 bloody chapters.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the show's build-up falls short because of this. Rin's inner turmoil over being wrong about Eiji and dealing with her emotions, Iyo's rivalry with Rin and maturing as a character, Sena's... anything really, Sena didn't even get her moment of glory when she was debating Gennai trying to convince the world that Eiji was innocent - they cut that to save time herp derp - so they could have at least given her part of the character development she got in the manga, - nope, not even that. I won't even get into the not-so-minor characters such as the Group of Ten and Hiiragi in particular.\\n\\n\r\nOne could even forgive that they messed up twice like that, but no, the new ending is just horrible. Big Order was never big on coherency but the anime ending takes the cake here - in the span of 2 minutes they introduce the \"God\" character, establish her invulnerability, and then get rid of her. And following this, we are taken to the next arc of the manga, where Eiji, Rin and Iyo are attending school together... except no, because it ends here with a bittersweet happy ending and no closure on anything.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly anime adaptations like these serve no purpose and would have been better off left unproduced until a respectable budget can be attained. It's a disservice to Esuno Sakae and the fans of Mirai Nikki otherwise.\\n",

Sadly, I was really disappointed in the end. It starts out well enough and even so to get me excited. But then it started to get weird, and I thought I could just ignore it but it then new strange things just kepthappening that didn't need to be in the show yet it was there. I'm always freaked out by lolicons and well, it disturbs me the ways it was shown. It's between that, confusing plot, bad pacing because the show was way too rushed, and I don't even think the writer knew what to do. It's like a joke with a really good windup but the worst delivery and or punchline. I really can't tell because there's many things about this show that it's hard to pin down what's the biggest contributor. Would I recommend people Big Order?

But the anime gives the impression that the director read the manga and went,\"Screw this. Let's just wing it, have fun and go full camp with this.\"\r\nIt's overall more mindless fun, more edgy-ness, more glorious sunlight, more random Rin death scenes, more heartwarming, more outright incest, more campy saxy (Yes, it's so sexy it becomes saxy) jazzy soundtracks, moreEiji x Rin, more defiance of basic laws of physics, more innuendo, more smile inducing and more jaw dropping (Edgy-sama. I'm pregnant). And they take the time to draw food- lots of food. Considering the source material, it's B-movie anime gold in its finest form, on par with the works by veteran studios such as Ghibli, feel, White Fox, Madhouse and ufotable.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is not a mere adaptation of a manga about Edgy-sama trying to save his beloved non-blood related imouto. It's a Gilgamesh and Homer level epic about a small studio's rebellious warcry against the gods who sneer and mock at them while tossing their endless divine arsenal of bad source material, flat characters, deus ex machinas and illogical plot twists upon humanity, just as Zeus chucks lightning bolts against any mere mortal who dares to defy him and scale Mount Olympus.\\n\\n\r\nOn a serious note, it's not \"Anime of the year\" material, but it's a strong contender for the \"Considering the budget and source material, you gave it your best\" category if it exists.

            "content": "(This review will try to be as spoiler free as possible to help you decide whether you wish to watch this)\r\nAfter having rewatched Mirai Nikki for the first time in three+ years and enjoying myself much more than I thought I would on the second run through (although I think a lot of that enjoyment was from nostalgia), I decided to check out so of Sakae Esuno's other works and after reading the plot to Big Order I decided to check it out in the hopes of some somewhat similar quality piece.\r\nBoy was I dissapointed.\r\nBig Order is like the somewhat awkward cousin you see onceor twice a year due to distance/family issues. Semi enjoyable for the first ten minutes as you reminisce about the past and family matters, but then quickly slips into awkward silence as you stand there looking for any other member of the family at this gathering so you can slip away as quickly and kindly as possible without damaging your boring cousin's feelings. \\n\\n\r\nI know Mirai Nikki is a contensious topic with some hailing the anime as the next coming of Christ whilst others wouldn't cross the road to spit on it, but when all is said and done Mirai Nikki had some objectively good features to it, such as a nice soundtrack, some form of character development (and indeed personality in the first place), and genuinely good moments that would evoke certain emotions. Big Order takes all the good parts of Mirai Nikki and throws them out the window, whilst keeping the crap like annoying whiny characters, a bizzare plot that moves at a mile a minute and often makes no sense, and enough plot holes to sink a ship. So without further ado, lets discuss why Big Order royally sucks.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nSpoilers inbound.\\n\r\nHoo boy. The story. The story... Big Order sure is a piece of work. The basic premise is the main character Eiji believes he caused the great destruction of Earth 10 years ago due to a divine power he obtained, and also that his sister only has 6 months left to live. \\n\r\nIn the first episode we get the set up, the exposition which immediately feels forced and boring, particularly with his sister, who just sort of sits their and says \"Onii-chan\" a lot. Then all of a sudden he is attacked on the way home by Kurenai Rin, one of the other main characters, and he gets into a fight with her where he uses his Order power for the first time since the destrction to win. Following the fight he binds her to his will stopping her from hurting him and not allowing her to leave 'his domain'. Already we have run into several problems. Firstly, before I rant, I'd just like to say at this point you're thinking \"Ok, so this is going to be some sort of Shojo anime where every week he attacked by another order user (mainly girls), and he dominates them and eventually they sort of warm up to him over time. Sounds a but stupid but hey, I can enjoy a light hearted semi romance Shojo every so often\". However, the show has already set itself up for a massive fall. By giving him the power of domination, it falls in to the same trap as Mirai Nikki, as the main character is clearly the most powerful, they have to puropsefully nerf/make up convenient rules/ completely forget about their ability to be able to make other characters have a chance at beating him and providing any tension. This in and of itself makes the show feel completely stupid. Then in the next episode he ends up fighting some more guys and this time gets introduced to the ten, half of whom you will see again about once. These ten are a callous and cold bunch, and are using Eiji to take over the world, and are the definite enemies of the show. For about ten minutes. Then we move forward with the change to taking over prefectures and seeking people out instead of having people come after him. Here he stops two nukes, but he couldn't do it himself and needed help in a moment of plot convenience. Then the plot moves again to having them go look for a healer for Sena, who then gets killed by a mysterious man (who is supposed to be one of the main villains but you never really feel any hatred for him as he is only in it about three times), then it turns out the ten aren't evil, then it turns out the evil is Eiji's father, then it turns out he isn't evil, then it turns out Sena is evil, then it turns out Sena isn't evil. See a large problem here? Plot twists happen about every minute, and they always tend to take the same shape. There are a hell of a lot thrown in and Im not sure a single one made any sense/was a good idea. I'm going to cut the story review off here and move on to the next section as otherwise it will devolve into episode by episode plot bashing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThere isn't really much to say about the art style, it's quite nice, and has the same feel of Esuno's other works (Mirai Nikki), just be warned if you weren't a fan of the creepy contracted pupil drawings that Esuno does throughout Mirai Nikki they're back again here, but this time with far less meaning as it the characters just aren't meant to be being creepy. Eiji and Rin are also carbon copy clones of Yuki and Yuno which docks a mark. Another one is docked as the Order's are basically discount stands from Jojo, but these use cheap looking CGI to make them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe sound track is alright. It's no masterpiece thats for sure, but I genuinely enjoyed some of the songs, particularly the piece that plays when Eiji uses his domination order the first few times which was a genuinely fun piece that made me feel like I was watching a superhero show, however the rest of the soundtrack was unmemorable and unimpressive, there is at least nothing offensive to the ears in it though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nNow we come to the dregs. The characters are without a doubt the worst part of this show. In the first three episodes we are introduced to somewhere between 10 and 15 characters, of whom half you can just ignore. Eiji, the main character is boring and bland, and never progresses throughout the show. We get great character development such as him going from \"I want to save my sister.\", to \"I want to save my sister!\". Truly astounding. His character also seems to lack set personality traits bouncing from brave to cowardly to relaxed to downright insane at times without there really ever being a reason for the character change. The only attachment I felt to this character was any lingering attachment I had to Yukiteru because, as stated above he is practically a clone of him looks wise. Then we have Rin, the 'Main heroine' if you will. I put it in quotes because she is absent for half the show, being abducted and just sort of never discussed again. She goes from hating Eiji to loving him in about 30 seconds, but that never gets explored because Eiji is too busy trying to date his sister. Speaking of his sister, Sena is a very 2d character whose only role is to occasionally say \"Onii-chan\" and get her brother riled up. She is held as a hostage for about 80% of the film and the only reason you want her to be rescued is so you dont have to hear Eiji obnoxiously scream \"SENA!\" one more time. She loves her brother very much yet does a complete 180 at the end of the show for about 30 seconds before flipping back again, but that's nothing new here. I'm going to talk about the rest of the characters as a whole as they're all cut and paste useless 2d lumps that have no souls. The rest of the cast are unimagined, lack any goals or purpose, and don't have any real reason for being their. Also the commander of the ten changes personality dramatically half way through, going from being evil to good in the span of five seconds.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this was pretty low. All in all I feel like I wasted my time watching this. The main reason I stuck around from the halfway point was because the whole thing is only ten episodes, and I feel like thats a lot of the problem with this show. Because its so short there isnt really any time to discuss or cover anything, so the plot jumps a mile a minute to keep up. I don't know whether this is faithful to the manga or not, or whether it is a lot more fleshed out and actually semi decent, but quite frankly, I don't want to know anymore. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nAgain, this was a poor piece, it is very rare I walk away from an anime series with absolutely no attachment to the characters or without a twinge of sadness that the journey is over, as with most things I watch/read, however, this was one of the rare times that I can just put it down and walk away without any sadness (although I will be playing the song \"Domination\" again a few more times). \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend Big Order?\\n\r\nNo.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ah Big Order...An anime I didn't even knew existed up until it ended. Really not kidding when I say that. I didn't.\r\nHello people. I'm Josh and today I am reviewing the first half of Big Order, probably the defintion of a spring anime bomb (atleast to most people)\r\nNow for those that don't know, Big Order is from the same creator of the ever popular Future Diary. Apparently this was an anticipated anime because of this guys work with Furure Diary but I be lying if I said I was excited. Not because I hate Future Diary. It cause I haven't seen it and I can'thate something I haven't seen. So I really had no high expectations cause I couldn't tell you what Future Diary was even about. Only thing I know is about it is some crazy pink hair chick that is the face of the yandere community. That's all. I couldn't tell you jack sh*t about the story if I tried, the characters even if I wanted to try and so on. But I guess people were excited cause of that.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway on to the review\\n\\n\r\nStory- It interesting. Like I said I had no expectations for it because I didn't know it even existed until it was a thing. But anyway the story is about Eiji, a guy that gives Kirito and Saitama a run for their money in the OP department. He along with other people referred with orders made a wish and his wish was to rule the world. This resulted in the world getting destroyed and the Orders being viewed as villans and major threats.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say it is interesting, but the pace is awful. It just feels extremely rushed and I am just bored watching it. I came in with average expectations since I didn't know what I was stepping into really. They major issues with this are the timing and the pacing. The fact it is only 10 episodes doesn't really help it either. If things were explained better and the timing was so god awful in this anime, this would probably be one of the OK anime of the spring. It would have helped to if the plot made more sense to be honest\\n\\n\r\nArt- The arts pretty good. I got no major complaints with it or anything. Definetly not the best I have seen but certainly not the worst. The fight scenes can be good and the cgi is good to.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Sound is alright. The OP is good but not something I'd really listen to repeatedly or anything. The ending is...ok to me. I got no major complaints with the voice actors, there fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- And the problems lie here. Definetly not enough expalining of things and not enough development for me to even remotely care about. I don't really care about the MC but I don't hate him. He is just that cliche 'Oh if you touch my sister I'll kick your f*cking a** b*tch' and basically some averages guy with some over the top OP power that lets him control pretty much everything and anyone. NotYuno (Guessing that's the crazy pink hair chick that is suppose to be Yuno. Not a hundred percent sure I'm just seeing people repeatedly calling her that so I am guessing it's the pink hair chick from Future Diary???) Is crazy and wants to kill him but can't. And then there are the rest of the supporting cast. Boy do they bore the living day lights out of me. I don't care about any of them. I mean Iyo is alright I guess but the rest I keep barely remembering.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- This just bored me. Arguably the worst anime of the spring I guess with the way people have gone on about it but I don't find it bad. Just extremely boring. It is just not interesting me. At all. If you like it fine, but I just can't get into this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- This is mediocre at best. To me atleast. The story may be interesting but pacing and timing are bad and it is rushed. The art and sound are alright if not good. The characters are forgettable to me but it isn't as god awful as most people make it out to be, but it really isn't that good. Mediocre at it best. This anime gets a 5/10 from me. I just got bored the entire time but this had potential that just fell flat somehow",

            "content": "I don't often write reviews for anime, but this series pissed me off so much that I felt the burning need to write about it.\r\nThe premise of Big Order is life after the apocalypse. An event known as the Great Destruction ruined the world, half of the human population was wiped out in an instant, and many hundreds of thousands continued to die after in the following strife. It all happened because the wishes and supernatural powers (known in this anime as Orders) of a single man, Hoshimia Eiji.\r\nIn the world that survives after the Great Destructiion, Eiji lives a quiet life with his sister.Eiji spends his time hiding from the world, for if the survivors learned of his part in the world ending, surely something horrible would befall him, or his sickly sister. However, when his sister is one day kidnapped, Eiji is drawn into a plot that will change the world.\\n\\n\r\nOn paper, the introduction is good. This anime gets even better in the first four episodes where the focus is on world domination starting from a single country. It can be viewed as one giant strategy game. But the writers decide to drop this interesting story in favour of a plot driven by trite sister complex garbage, and shoe horned pseudo philosophy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is garbage, at least this anime is very pretty to look at. Like with Future Diary, the art blends more traditional animation styles with 3D CG effects when any Order (people with special powers) use their abilities. Again, very similar to Future Diary in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has pretty introductions and endings. The opening theme grew on me a little as the show went on and certainly fits the setting of the show. \"Disorder\". by Yui, is still a pretty horrible song, aiming for a heavy rock theme with plenty of synthesized voice effects, but at least the lyrics work. I cannot talk about the ending theme because it was so bad I never fully watched it all the way through. The insert music for this show is pretty good, however. Especially the battle music in the first four episodes. However, while this show has quite a bit of alright music, almost none of it is memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are very hit and miss. The one defining character trait for our hero is \"SENA!\". Seriously, anything this guy does he only does to make his sister happy. Expect to see this play heavily into how the show ends. Sena herself seems like she could have been an interesting character had she been given more screen time that went beyond her being a stereotypical soft spoken female character who does little to anything. She does have one or two interesting scenes where we see how cunning she can be, but that gets dropped in a hurry. We also have a yandere chick with a sword, Yuno Gas -- I mean, Rin, who the writers largely forget about after the first half of the series. Rin's motivation is to kill Eiji for causing her parents to die when the world ended, but as she spends more time with Eiji she starts to show some form of inner conflict regarding this, which is never fully explored until the writers decide to force the issue over the span of three minutes in the last episode. There are a few other interesting characters, but its hard to get excited about anybody in this show after the first half.\\n\\n\r\nAll told, I would rate this anime as a skip. This show had huge initial potential, but Big Order fails to deliver in a big way.",

There are also some things that I dislike here, like the terrible plot, events are so random that it left plot holes.

            "content": "Big Order...more likely Big Disaster, or Mirai Geass: Oreimo Crusaders. Seriously, it's imposible to find something original inside this anime. From the start, it's imposible not to draw parallels between Big Order and the author's previous work [Mirai Nikki] , only that Big Order was executed more poorly. \r\nIt had a somewhat promising start that was quickly overshadowed by the amount of copied material from other anime. \r\nStory: So, ten years ago, a kid Wished for the world's destruction, as a result, the world was almost destroyed in a paranormal event known as the \"Big Destruction\" , were half the human population died. The responsiblefor that destruction was the main Character, Hoshimiya Eiji. From then on, it's a trainwreck, where the story draws too much from Code Geass progression, but without the awesomeness of it.  The story turns out very weak, and full of inconsistences, the power of the \"Orders\" is incredibly ambigous and unreliable, not even the author knew how to make them work, so in some instances they were incredibly powerful, and in others they were as good as a water gun against a battleship. Every other element from the story is over cliched and exploited, at the end one is wondering why not just  let the \"Villian\" win.  4/10 because the last 2 episodes were kind of decent.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe character design is the same as Mirai Nikki. For real, the Main character and some other characters look like alternate designs for Mirai Nikki's characters, and those not taken from Mirai Nikki have generic and uninspired designs.  That aside, the backgrounds look good, animation was acceptable, but too  much use of CG kills it.  But still, it's not like Mirai Nikki's character design was bad. 7/10.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nYousei Teikoku in the opening. 10/10, easily one of the best openings for the season. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHonestly, they were totally inconsistent with themselves, their attitude, behaivour, motives, feelings, nothing was consistent for the whole story, some characters appeared to be playing double or triple agent, but in reality they were just badly done. Some characters were totally unexplained, others were just bad filler in order to have a wide cast, but no character got enought screen time to be properly developed. perhaps the more consistent character was Iyo, as she was in love for the whole anime. \\n\\n\r\nThen, we have the Orders, the supernatural powers of this anime. I'll be honest, The orders are STANDS. yes,  (((STANDS))), they act like stands, move like them, and serve a similar battle purpouse, some have a Humanoid form, some are ambigous concepts or artifacts, the main problem is, we never get to know the actual extent of their abilities.  \\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nShow is so bad that I actually did enjoy it. If you scrap all coherent and consistent tought process, you can enjoy this anime. Battles were good, it had it's fun moments, the last episode was epic, and it had a very unexpected Fairytale good ending. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI did enjoy it, but, it is a bad anime, critically speaking, it is bad. and totally not memorable. But at least we got a full story and won't have to wait for a never coming second season. \\n\r\n5/10.",

            "content": "Story: 3/10\r\nThe story had so much potential because of the premise they had in the beginning: The Elite Ten were trying to take over Japan and Eiji was going to be their figurehead/puppet. I thought it was going to be interesting because they would kind of be the bad guys and I like when some anime have the villains as the main characters because I like to see things from their perspective and point of view. The story could've gone in so many good directions, but instead they forget about it in the middle of the series and decide to just focus on saving Sena.\r\nArt:6/10\\n\r\nThe art was okay. I liked the design of the characters. I really liked the designs of the Orders because they all looked unique and badass. Though, the reason I give the art a 6 is because I didn't like how the Orders looked like 3D models.\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI really liked the music, especially the opening song. The series did a good job of setting the tone in scenes with the music.\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nThe series did a terrible job with the characters. None of them were likable. Eiji's goal was retarded. All he cared about was making the world a place where he and Sena could live in?! Not only is it selfish, but it doesn't make the audience want to root for him. No wonder everyone either uses or tries to kill him. Don't even get me started with the fact that they used incest with Sena and Eiji. I'm not trying to be controversial here, this is just my opinion, but I do not support incest. Rin doesn't even count as a main love interest. In fact, I shipped Eiji/Iyo more than Eiji/Rin. Iyo legitimately liked Eiji while Rin was just trying to seduce him so she can kill him. Just because they kiss once doesn't mean anything. Hiiragi disappointed me. I liked him in the beginning and I liked how they gave him a backstory, but in the end, he was just as selfish as Eiji. I'm going to give the series a pass on not giving backstory on the other members of the Elite Ten since it was only 10 episodes, which is obviously not enough time for character development of every single main character, but I wish they could've at least done Iyo since she got so much screen time. She was interesting and I wish the series would have gone more in depth with her character besides just serving Eiji.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nOverall, I didn't hate the series because it had a lot of potential, but there were a lot of things I hated about it. \\n\r\nFinal score: 5/10\\n\r\nP.S.: I didn't read the manga, but I have a feeling I would enjoy it more than the anime. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody.",

            "content": "\"Order! Be a piece of crud!\" (....Okay, that wasn't an actual quote.)\r\nBig Order? I think the title should be \"Big Disaster\", and it's not just because of the fact that there was a disaster ten years before the events of the anime. It's because the anime is a big disaster. The only reason why I decided to watch it is because it's by the same mangaka as \"Future Diary\"; even though I've currently only seen three episodes of that anime, I've been enjoying it. I also watched the Big Order OVA; it was really confusing, but I thought, \"Hey, maybe the series will make moresense?\" Of course, there have been times where my intuition was wrong, and unfortunately, this is one of those times.\\n\\n\r\nBig Order follows a teenage boy named Eiji Hoshimiya. Ten years ago, he caused the \"Great Destruction\" because of a wish, and with the Great Destruction came the Order users, who have powers that are born from a wish. One day, he meets Rin Kurenai, an Order who wants to kill him because the Great Destruction killed her parents. Eventually, Eiji becomes the leader of an organization that declares war on other countries to become an independent country, and he sets off to create a world where his wheelchair-bound sister, Sena, can live happily.\\n\\n\r\n....Wait a second. Why does all of this sound familiar?\\n\\n\r\nOh, right. It's because Big Order has a story that is clustered with cliches. A crazy, revenge-bent girl? Pretty sure I've seen that somewhere before. An organization that the protagonist is declared the leader of? Yep. A wheelchair-bound younger sister? For Pete's sake, even though they're in wheelchairs for two different reasons, Sena is a rip-off of Nunnally in this aspect! Not only that, but Big Order's story throws in some unnecessary plot points at times. (For example, who gets pregnant from having your ribbon touched?! What I just said is barely even a spoiler, because the baby went away later!) What's even worse than the story, though? The characters! They barely get any (reasonable) development, and they all just come off as one-dimensional. I especially hate the main character, Eiji; in a nutshell, he's a not-so-smart version of Lelouch.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime, I've seen some bugs in the animation department, but it's not horrible overall. Asread did an okay job with the animation for Big Order. The voice acting isn't bad either, but some of them either overdid it or didn't show a lot of emotion. I wasn't really a fan of the ending theme, \"Kobore Sekai Oware\", either; it was an okay song, but it didn't really grab my attention. If I was the kind of person who just skips opening and ending themes of anime, I think I would have definitely skipped it. As for the opening theme, \"DISORDER\", I actually thought it was sort of cool. Visually, I didn't think it was much, but the song itself was kind of catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I wasn't a fan of Big Order at all. If you're a Future Diary fan who absolutely MUST be Sakae Esuno's other works, and ONLY if that's the case, I would recommend it to you; otherwise, I'd advise you to stay away. After all, this anime isn't what the doctor ordered; it'll most likely kill some of your brain cells. Big time.",

The truly important things of an anime (at least what I think) are characters, execution, and writing. Which it all failed miserably.\\n\\n\r\nSo in these terms, this anime would be a dead rat with some nice jewelry.\\n\r\nWe would be like, \"Oh wow! Nice jewelry! But why does this dead rat have it ew....\"\\n\\n\r\nBut even so, I enjoyed this anime because it was so bad. One of my pet peeves are ridiculous character logic, I can't stand it. But it does make for an interesting night of screaming and raging.\\n\r\nBut for this, it did make me scream, but it also did make me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nSo pretty much yeah, you can watch it if you want, but don't take it seriously, you will be disappointed. But if you don't want to watch the anime, there is one reason you should watch it, and it's because of a certain scene, if you watched Big Order, you would know what I mean (cough cough) Iyo and Reiji (cough cough) ribbon.\\n\\n\r\nOh and also incest warning too.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Never before have I been so utterly befuddled at every solitary minute of an anime series. Even actions that I was able to justify with logical explanations were then turned by the series itself into nonsensical, self contradictory reasoning. Big Order goes out of its way to read the guide to solid storytelling upside down, without wearing glasses, and eating the lamp which is allowing it to see the words.\r\nThere's no point going into minutia, we'd be here all day. Let's start with the story. Our main character, Whocares McProtagonist, gets blackmailed into announcing that he is trying to take over the world with thisorganization of superpowered beings. Yes, that is our start. Each of them has a unique ability given to them by a 'wish'. Usually the wish involved something causing them to think 'I want to survive', therefore the character's power is immortality. It seems to be a base desire in a stressful moment that allowed them to get out of it. Then there are other characters with robot unicorns who fire hyper beams that I REALLY want to know what wishes led to that, but who cares let's never explain backstories.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half is about this organization using McProtagonist to take over a city in Japan as their first conquest. The series sets up how the rest of the world hates them, how people CHEER in the streets at live executions of their family members. This entire plotline is abandoned halfway through when a villain shows up, which the series becomes about defeating with no real mentions of their main goal. NO points follow from one half to the other. They face no issues from being so detested and starting a war. Who needs consequences, right?\\n\\n\r\nNext big point: our main character has the most broken power there has ever been. He can literally control reality itself by his own words in any area he has stepped. He can defy gravity, the most fundamental force in the universe. He can take control of the wills of the people around him. Yet whenever an action scene happens, he forgets he can do anything except... I don't even know, he just exerts forces outwards in palm thrusts I guess.\\n\\n\r\nI don't even know where to go from there in all honesty, and that's fine, because the series doesn't know where it's going either, nor how much budget is left as it nears its end. Whoops, money gone!\\n\\n\r\nOh, I guess a giant rock golem shows up near halfway through as though this is normal, even though we've never seen anything remotely like it. But I didn't even care.\\n\\n\r\nBig Order is a masterpiece of non sequitur nonsense. I'm impressed that it was even written considering the author must have been so distracted by the fact that the rest of their house was on fire. If you have a bunch of friends with you or can enjoy laughing at a building that is falling apart from the bottom up and spinning while it plummets toward the ground, then its spinning digs it deeper and deeper below the surface like a drill, I wholeheartedly recommend watching this series from beginning to end. In episode 3, you will know if you are in the Valhalla of terrible animes or not. This was one of the most enjoyable experiences I'd had in ages, and that wasn't because of anything the show was TRYING to do.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you want to watch something that's actually good, stay far away. Seriously. I only give 1's if there is nothing objectively redeemable. Even good music will earn at least a 2 since that meant someone tried and didn't simply play the same jazzy song over every action scene, even when it didn't match the tone at all.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all. Review done.",

            "content": "My review summed up in one sentence: Big Order had a lot of Big Potential that went to waste. Here is why:\r\nThe idea was brilliant and original. Super natural abilities were given to those with one true wish that they desired. Those that desired wealth were deemed shallow, those that desired immortality deemed fearful, those that desired an all too common wish deemed unoriginal. Only those with true desires and wished got the ability to do them. < This here my friends is a great plot and a great idea.\r\nBUT, the execution of this brilliant idea was lackluster at most. The main character lacked convictionup till the final minute where he was spurred on by a girl that loved him yet forced him to man up for his love of his sister. (Ugh I hate it when a girl loves a guy but has to convince him to chase his love for another, EVEN WORSE he needed her help to accomplish it)\\n\\n\r\nThe music was absolutely Mediocre at best with music that I wouldn't even have as background music under any circumstance.\\n\\n\r\nThere was no backstory established for the other 10 supporting cast, they were just given abilities without any feelings to it. Just *poof* have some super powers and a halfhearted reason.\\n\\n\r\nThere were plot holes so far and many that it was almost impossible to ignore and just accept them. The anime was just shoving facts down my throat and hoping that I would be ok with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending to the anime was horrendous to say the least. The massive plot hole with the underwhelming as hell conclusion. THE GUY'S ULTIMATE WISH AND DESIRE CAME TRUE AND HE BECAME A FISH ABOUT IT. HE WASN'T HAPPY, HE WASN'T CONTENT, HE WAS EMOTIONLESS LIKE A GOD DAMN FISH.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime did have some good points.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters went directions that weren't absolute cliches, like the sister becoming a badass. The bad guys were good guys but is willing to give up anything to make their dreams come true (looking at you lieutenant)\\n\\n\r\nIt was action packed without much boring moments, no fillers or empty episodes ... although that comes with the 10 episodes limitation.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I did enjoy it, it had the potential to be a master piece, but it failed to do so.\\n\r\nTherefore I rate it a solid 6.8/10",

            "content": "BIG Review \r\n      So you may be wondering why the I rated it so high on enjoyment. Here is why, have you ever watched something so amazingly bad that you enjoyed it? This is what happened to me concerning Big Order. Its about a kid that gets some magical power from a girl named C.C.... uh no no daisy that's her name. And his power is uhhh well he can literally control anything and everything INCLUDING GOD if the plot calls for it. He is trying to make the world a better place for his sister Nunnall...uhh I mean Senathat's right. He is trying to make the world a better place for his sister Sena and when he tried to do so he accidentally BLOWS it up. \\n\\n\r\n      So I better stop rambling about the story before you get 100% lost before even watching it. This anime is so bad, that it's actually kind of good. This anime is sooooo easy to hate that you love hating it. The pacing is awful, the story is a copy of Code Geass' story if Code Geass' story got hit in the head by a lot of bricks. The characters all suck and you love to hate every stupid thing they say or do. At the end of an episode after focusing hard and trying to pay attention I simply said \"what\" the story makes no sense at all. So in conclusion Big Order is a Big piece of garbage, but its so bad that it is good. If you are bored, or angry at something this anime will help you. It's so idiotic and terrible that its actually hilarious. Grab a friend that is equally as bored or angry as you are and watch Big order, I promise you will be in tears by the end of episode 3 and you will have a blast bashing another man's life work. Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "Saying that this anime is so bad, that it is good might feel overly simplistic and at this point probably redundant, however it remains a pretty accurate summary of my feelings towards this series, I would even dare to say that, aside from Garzeys Wing, no other anime, that I have seen, has rivaled Big Order in this regard.\r\n The OST is surprisingly nice, there are some pleasent colours and the directing is certainly unique, but if you are not delighted by the terrible characters and story these things will definitely not win you over, however if you are, than Big Order might just bethe unintentional comedy for you.",

While the story itself was not awful i felt that this was caused by the fact that thisanime only had 10 episodes. In the latter however i wasn't disappointed as the fight scenes in the anime were really well done and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting the anime had a number of veterans in its cast including one of my favorites Saori Hayami. As a whole the voice acting for the anime was top notch with particular praise going to the seiyuu's  for Rin and Iyu respectively as they were truly amazing. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of cons however the anime has some issues that stop it from being one of the great ones. The first issue is the art style that this anime used. While the art style was fine in most cases i felt that it was not consistent through the season which is a bit odd. The story itself is rather complex and not explained nearly enough and as a result is sometimes hard to follow especially if you come back to an episode after some time. Finally at only 10 episodes long i felt that the anime was a bit to short which consequently affected the story as well as the ending. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Big order was a decent anime that was let down by its short length and its story.",

            "content": "This was a cool anime with a interesting premise, where people are granted wishes, and then given powers based upon those wishes.  I found it very much fascinating, most of the powers were unique in their own way.\r\nThe story I enjoyed and works for the most part, it did feel a tad rushed near the end as this is only a ten episode series, and felt like it could have used another two to three more episodes to flesh it out, but it still works, and there are surprises along the way that are revealed over time.\r\nI think part of the strength of thisanime though is the characters, many of them have their own powers and abilities, with a decent supporting cast, though they don't all get enough time to shine, they are given their moments.\\n\\n\r\nI give this a recommendation for sure, just realize some of the things I mentioned above.  A 8/10",

Somehow his wish to rule the world ends up bringing about the destruction of the world and also grants him the power to control others. Ten years later, people continue their lives but are full of hatred for Orders after learning of their existence and enjoy seeing them die a horrible death. New Orders continue to appear and as they reveal themselves Eiji manages to control one of the assasins Rin out to avenge herparents who died during the destruction. As Rin continues to find ways to get her revenge on Eiji, Eiji is blackmailed into becoming a puppet \"leader\" by the rest of the Orders who aim to conquer the world by force.\\n\\n\r\nThis show features a sadistic heroine and funnily enough, the Manga this show is based on is by Sakae Esuno who also wrote Future Diary which is also another show with a similar heroine.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like sadistic cute girls enjoy causing pain to others you might enjoy this. Using the world full of hate as an excuse, the show doesn't hesitate to go about slaughtering people or using death as a joke. Outside of that, every episode sheds light on each Order who have some silly powers and personalities. So one moment you're watching gruesome deaths, the next you're laughing at silly things. Somtimes the show tries to look smart as if there's some clever scheme going on... Overall the direction doesn't feel very well thought out. Like random ideas thrown in.\\n\\n\r\nThere's little to like about this show. No good art work, direction's ridiculously silly, world setting's unoriginal, silly powers. Future Diary was better than this.",
