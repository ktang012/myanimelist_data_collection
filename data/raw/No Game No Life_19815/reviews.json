            "content": "\"Give people bright colors and fan service and they go crazy and lose any logic\"\r\nNo game No Life is a curious anime to me. I Consider myself to be a not so cruel scorer always giving anime a chance and always looking for positives but this is not the case for No Game No Life with me. Considered to be the next best thing since canned bread everybody seems to love this and I'm the only one who cant see what is so good about it. I will try to give my vision on the show in the next couple of sections so please barewith me.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story without giving away too much its about 2 overly intelligent pair of step brothers Sora and Shiro  who are portrayed as neets. They are bored with normal life and just love to play videogames. One day they get the opportunity to join a game world where 16 races rule. In the game world extreme and weird games exist with rules varying per agreement of the players so everything is at stake. All seems peaches and cream for an interesting anime with some good story movement except that the story progression is really slow.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up its really nice neon colors. Very fluid and detailed animation especially the background. I have to say that despite not enjoying the anime this is its strongest asset and its really pleasing to the eye. Madhouse really did a good job with the art and I think its top 2 of the season along with Bokura Wa mina Kawaisou. \\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\r\nI don't think it was over the top or memorable that you want to buy the OST's or anything. Nothing really negative else to say by my part except that it was solid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (Only will be covering 3)\\n\\n\r\na) Sora - Main character, 18 year old neet who lives with his loli stepsister Shiro. Overly intelligent and with many sexual needs (according to the show). Sora quickly became an apparent icon this season for best character this season and all I can say is why? One of Sora's biggest strengths is also his downfall as a character and this is his super intelligence. Nothing is ever a challenge in this supposed challenging game world to him and he always seems to have a plan for everything. He tries to be too cool for my liking. I never found any of his jokes or references to be funny or entertaining only just kinda corny.\\n\\n\r\nb) Shiro - The other main character, 11 year old step sister of Sora. More intelligent than Sora apparently and has a brother complex. With Shiro its another case of overuse of Lolis for roles that can be fulfilled with normal characters along with Black Bullet. I don't get the semi naked scenes of Shiro which in this case is a minor throughout the show and it feels a bit disturbing. Shiro's downfall as a character to me is that she is just there to pull Sora back together and do some crazy deus ex machima to pull him out of the rare stuff that he cant (going according to plan if we follow the show's logic) do. \\n\\n\r\nc) Stephanie Dola - The other main character who's purpose is nothing but be exposed half naked every 4 minutes and be mocked off because of her stupidity. I have gotten slander here on MAL because apparently her role is much deeper in motivating Sora and what not if you go all philosophical with the fan boys. In reality its not and her contribution to the progression of the plot is about 0. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nWhere is the enjoyment supposed to come from this show? If its the games it did a poor job. You never get the sensation that the games are a challenge for any of the main characters because everything goes according to plan and they are never really under any concern due to Sora and Shiro's super Einstein like intellect. There is always something that saves them from defeat or something which gets really annoying by episode 3 or 4. \\n\\n\r\nLet me say that chess game in episode the span of episodes 4-5? (I maybe wrong) Is probably the worst thing you can ever watch since there is absolutely no logic behind it all and its just a complete out of thin air invention to win the game. The only game I really enjoyed where the last 2 episodes because the main characters where actually in a pinch it goes in the most predictable way of having the most useless character in the show do something. It all went according to the same generic running theme throughout the show that everything is going according to the super master plan that we won the game before we even start. How do people get any joy out of this is beyond me. \\n\\n\r\nThe core of the plot is really slow and its pretty much overshadowed by the fan service and stupidity of Stephanie who is pretty much just a guinea pig to try out stuff throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nIn the end I was really disappointed since I was looking forward to the show and all I got was just a slap in the face of how overrated, flawed and boring this show is some weeks in. The fan service outshines the plot and that is already a red flag. The plot already weak to begin with and all you get is boobs and stupidity with slow progression its not really ideal.",

Originally a light novel written by Kamiya Yuu, No Game No Life (or NGNL for short) is a series not quite like any other, mixing together numerous ordinary concepts into a not-so-ordinary and very refreshing story. It is not just about originality though, but the provided execution is absolutely fantastic as well, as this is one of the most addictive and over-the-top anime you'll ever come across.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Story--\\n\r\nHow can anything seemingly so dumb be so damn smart?\\n\\n\r\nIn recent years there has been a fair share of anime following the concept of \"being trapped inside a video game with no way to escape it\", and it has been very successful. No Game No Life however takes the exact same idea and flips it upside down. This story is not about being trapped inside a game world, but rather instead it's about voluntarily being in a fantasy world which has its very foundation oriented around the concept of games. The only other anime I can think of that uses a somewhat similar idea is Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo, but NGNL takes it one or two steps further, and more importantly does it around nine or ten levels better.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a legendary player team in the online gaming community named \"[ ]\" (pronounced \"K\u016bhaku\", or \"Blank\" in English) which was known for never ever losing to anyone, no matter which game they were playing. Their real-life identities however were unknown to the world, but as it turned out it consisted of a pair of NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) gamer siblings: 18 year old Sora and his 11 year old little sister Shiro. These two geniuses were completely fed up with the real world and didn't think of it as anything more than a shitty game, and therefore spent all their time in their room owning others in online games. That is to say before they got challenged online by a mysterious chess player who brought them to the very limits of their abilities before they could eventually manage to win. As a result, they got contacted by someone named Tet; the God of another world called Disboard, the ultimate paradise for gamers of Sora's and Shiro's caliber and he therefore invited them to come live in his world instead. And thus, the games began.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of Disboard, there are a total of sixteen different races that have been granted the protection of the Ten Commandments, and are therefore the only ones worth mentioning. These races are seeded in order of magical strength, and at the very bottom of the ranking we find the race of Imanity, which is Disboard's equivalent to the human race (clearly a spinoff of the word \"humanity\"). However as shameful as being at the bottom of the food chain might be, that ranking was made before Sora and Shiro arrived as reinforcements.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the story of No Game No Life is about the siblings' long-term plans of conquering the world by challenging others at games and using the Ten Commandments' wagers as winnings while (hopefully) maintaining [ ]'s 100% win record. Sounds simple enough, right? Well it's not.\\n\\n\r\nThe catch is that since the Ten Commandments make up the very structure of the world itself, combined with the fact that it's a supernatural world containing magic to begin with; what the games are, how they are played and what their consequences are is *completely* limitless. This anime can and will do anything and everything as long as the author can think it up in his head beforehand, and let me tell you: what he has managed to cook up is nothing short of spectacular. Seriously, the amount of creativity and pure awesomeness poured into the various game sessions throughout this anime should most definitely *not* be understated, and as a result NGNL has some of the best single individual episodes I've ever seen in my anime career.\\n\\n\r\nOf course that is not to say the grander, overarching story is any less impressive. Actually it manages to maintain the individual episode quality while still staying on track for the long-term plot in a very smooth manner of fashion, and as a result the anime never ever gets boring. It has a very high \"lowest level\u201d so to speak, but it does still get a bit spiky as some episodes are a lot better than others, however that is a jump ranging from \"good\" to \"amazing\" rather than ever dipping down very much. You'll constantly be starved for more.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nWhoever would have thought NEETs would be so neat?\\n\\n\r\nAs the 2-man protagonist team of the series, undoubtedly the vast majority of the focus in the character department is on Sora and Shiro themselves, and they're certainly not disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSora is extremely charismatic and cunning. He uses tons of deceitful tactics and strategies planned out way in advance in order to direct the flow of events much more so than meets the eye at first glance. As he likes to say, no matter how the game turns out, his victory is already assured from the very beginning. Of course this does not mean he's the second coming of Light or Lelouch, as Sora has no sinister ulterior motives (other than perverted ones every so often) and instead is really a very humorous and enthusiastic person that just likes to have fun.\\n\\n\r\nShiro on the other hand looks like nothing more than a moe fanservice loli at first glance, and to some extent I cannot say that part is wrong per se. In case you didn't realize it this is an ecchi anime in the end. We're talking about very light ecchi here and nothing that ever feels forced but rather used for comedy instead, however you still shouldn't be shocked if you find some nudity and boob groping every once in a while. Now as far as Shiro herself is concerned, that does however not change the fact that there is a hell of a lot more to her than that. For one she's quite fun to listen to with her almost completely expressionless voice, yet very blunt choice of words. Also, in reality her level of genius is way above that one of her brother, but in a very different way. Shiro's mind works sort of like a supercomputer, capable of unmatched amounts of logical thinking and data storage at any given point. On the other hand this makes her less adaptable than Sora, however what this means is that the pair of them perfectly complement each other's weaknesses. Thus even if they might be defeatable on their own, when they play together they are almost invulnerable, hence why [ ] is always together as one... actually whenever they are out of each other's line of sight they start panicking and get seizures and god knows what else.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast primarily consists of Stephanie Dola (or Dora, either works) whom at first also looks like the obligatory fanservice character but before long you'll realize that she's much more of a comic relief character... or rather the butt of everyone else's jokes. Now normally I might be a bit skeptical to that idea but this girl fills that role absolutely *perfectly*. Huge props to her voice actress I also have to add, she really did an awesome job expressing Stephanie's impulsive behaviour. There is also the ever so popular Jibril who is just all around awesome in every way, but I'll avoid talking about her as she is introduced later on in the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Art--\\n\r\nNo you're not on drugs, it actually looks like that\\n\\n\r\nThe word \"colorful\" doesn't even begin to scratch the surface on this one. Animated by Madhouse, NGNL probably has the most vivid color scheme I've yet to come across in an anime and it is hard to put into words just what exactly it looks like. It has tons of purple and red everywhere and tends to use colors even for distinguishing details like shadows, outlines and similar. It's really the kind of thing you need to see for yourself to understand but it sure as hell stands out from the crowd.\\n\\n\r\nAs always when it comes to artwork, it is entirely a subjective matter and whether you like it or not is up to every viewer individually. Personally I really liked it though, it somehow fit the over-the-top environments and atmosphere of the series very well, but I would still have to say that had it been for any other anime it would probably just have come off as being really weird.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\r\nCan you feel that beat? Beating everyone at everything that is\\n\\n\r\nOn its own this was definitely the part which I thought about the least while I was actually watching the series, but when looking at it in retroperspective it's actually really solid.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing, the OP of NGNL never particularly blew me away but to be fair I mostly ended up skipping it all the time because I was so eager to get into the new episode every week so I could never really pay too much attention to it. The ED is better albeit still not amazing, although when the full version came out I found it a lot more enjoyable than I did during the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nThat part asides though, the OST for the anime itself is one or two levels above that. Especially the music playing during some of the games themselves as well as the occasional epic speeches that occurs every once in a while during this anime have some very epic background tracks along with them.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting goes, many people will recognize the main seiyuu combi of Matsuoka Yoshitsugu and Kayano Ai making up Sora's and Shiro's respective roles. The first thing I noticed with this was that this is the exact same MC seiyuu coupling as that one of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, and just like Shiina in said anime, Shiro's voice is insanely husky and is almost like a whisper most of the time... in an adorable way of course. As far as Sora goes, more people will probably familiarize him with the fact that he has the same voice actor as Kirito from Sword Art Online, which might give some people the impression that NGNL is yet another anime which goes down the same route SAO did... which is definitely not the case.\\n\\n\r\nThey both make an absolutely solid performance in this case anyway, however to me the best voice acting in No Game No Life is the one done by Hikasa Yoko in her role as Stephanie. The role she has as the character constantly getting abused by the two siblings simply for their enjoyment (combined with the tsukkomi character she has to play for whenever their inner NEETs surface) results in her having numerous different comedy roles at the same time, yet Yoko absolutely nails them all every single time in an absolutely hilarious fashion.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment--\\n\r\n12x23 minutes never felt so short\\n\\n\r\nI'm just going to straight-up say that this is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable anime I've seen to date. Normally I don't like to watch series while they're currently airing very much, however I did it with this one and let me tell you waiting a full week for every new episode of this anime was painful. Excruciatingly so. This is not due to aspects such as constant cliffhangers or anything (although that also happens a few times) but simply due to how much fun every single episode is to watch. The concept of the anime as a whole is extremely appealing and interesting to follow, and due to the unlimited potential of the games themselves, every episode is completely different from the last one despite following the same ideals.\\n\\n\r\nThere's just so much charisma poured into the characters' over-the-top settings and it never fails to keep you hooked. Every single character is likable yet drastically different from one another. On top of all that the actual comedy part of NGNL is brilliant as well, including countless references to other anime series. I'm not sure exactly how it manages but somehow no matter which side of the show is present at any given moment, it delivers flawlessly every single time.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\r\nSo why aren't there any games like this in real life?\\n\\n\r\nEver since I first read the synopsis of this anime several months before it started airing, I immediately thought to myself: \"Hey, this sounds pretty awesome, wincest plus video games?\". Now as it turned out there wasn't very much in the way of wincest as this is solely sibling love, however what we got instead simply blew away pretty much all expectations I ever had. I did have a feeling that it would be something I would really like, but I don't think anyone who hadn't read the light novels ever imagined it to turn out this damn awesome.\\n\\n\r\nI love pretty much everything about this show, and that's not something I can say very often. From start to finish I don't think there was a single moment which I didn't enjoy, and that is something almost unheard of in anime. It's so versatile in the way that it's funny, original, charismatic, intelligent and just plain epic and awesome, all working in tandem. As a result, everything ends up being immensely satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nNow this first season covers up to the end of volume three of the original light novels, and at the current time (the anime just finished airing), there are six volumes released in Japan, so there's already plenty of content to adapt and hopefully season two won't be too far around the corner, although as always it will come down to sales numbers in the end.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, it sure as hell needs a second season sooner rather than later, as we're all going to suffer from abstinence until then.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGame Over..... for now at least........ hopefully",

            "content": "[contains spoilers]\r\nMake no mistake, No Game No Life is built to be a blockbuster. Madhouse adapting \"one of those\" wildly successful isekai light novel series made sense considering their generally poor commercial performance as of late. And NGNL, a blitzkrieg of dastardly clever action and outrageous gags, as unsettling as it is original, certain delivers a worthy blockbuster, but not without significant shortcomings.\r\nThe anime centers around the Blank siblings - Sora and Shiro: brother and sister, two shut-in NEETs on Earth, but certain victors in a new absurdist world, whose ambitions and exploits, leave their adversaries confounded and awed at the same damn time. Ostensibly,the pair could be written off as a simple gary stu/mary sue pairing. By technicality they are, but they\u2019re far from boring or cliche characters like many that fit that designation due to how the series presents their NEET qualities. Both brother and sister come off as legitimately fun leads, with flashy traits that resemble iconic characters from other well-known anime, novels, or games without feeling like standard self-inserts. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, our pair of gaming prodigies are whisked into a new isekai world, Disboard, by its enigmatic God, Tet and by the fourth, they are the rulers of Elkia, the last kingdom of Imanity, the human race. NGNL hits the ground running and doesn\u2019t let up for a second. The worldbuilding and plot development resembles the progression of an RPG: minor games precede major ones with interludes in between. Nearly the entirely of the seasons\u2019 276 minute runtime can be neatly categorized into plotting, games, or \"breaks in action\" - which generally involve harassing Steph or all the females taking baths while Sora sits back on the partition as hilarity ensues. This oversexualization and fanservice is responsible for some of the funniest moments of the season and serves to enhance the over-the-top, volatile energy of the show. \\n\\n\r\nNGNL\u2019s framework makes it easy to overstate the otaku and gamer escapism and gratification, which itself is offputting for those who have anathema to the common isekai mainstays of \"wish fulfillment\" and \"fanservice\" while indiscriminately associating these to inherently tasteless anime without a second thought. This line of logic downplays not only downplays the consistent insanity of the action, but also the nuance of the overarching premise behind the parodical, ludicrous nature of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a certain poetic justice captured by NGNL in its portrayal of how NEETs and hikikomori, who Japanese society would deem outcasts or losers regardless of their gaming talent, become monarchs, harem ringleaders, and ultimately winners. Much of NGNL\u2019s charm is more readily appreciated by seasoned otaku, who embrace, and even long for, the taboos that could potentially come with an isekai power trip. After all, it\u2019s a show for them. There are many NEET isekai series, some tone-deaf edgefests and others indiscernible carbon copies of each other, but NGNL separates itself with minutae that captures the essence of what it means to be a NEET. The jokes, including the hypersexual ones, border on gut-wrenchingly hilarious for them and uncomfortable for almost everyone else. The chemistry between cast members generates at least a few memorable one-liners and interactions every episode. The constant stream of clever allusions ranging from Skyrim to Laputa to Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei to ICO are bound to elicit grins when noticed. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being an underdog story about NEETs in disguise, but from the beginning it\u2019s evident that all Blank does is win (no DJ Khaled) in this new world - because after all, to beat a RPG you gotta win against every boss. Thus the goal of the series develops into a making the viewer hooked on HOW they win each and every game. While there are brilliant highs, towards the end of the season, the state of the games have gotten to the point where the constant victory really does begin to dull the suspense to the point where the result of the final game itself came of as anticlimactic, bordering on deus ex machina. Nonetheless, it would be ingenuous to not expect gaps of logic, plot armor, and minor plot holes, but none of them are particularly questionable or bothersome enough to reduce the quality of the series at large. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other side, the highlight is the sudden Shiratori game with Jibril, unsurprisingly the only character who can keep up with the Blank siblings' craziness, where the intensity and cleverness of each response ratcheting up to another level. It was the first and only moment where it felt like our heroes could actually LOSE while we watch hydrogen bombs and stars explode because of a fucking simple children's word game - all while laughing (hysterically, I might add) at the sheer preposterousness of it all. Blank\u2019s other challengers haven\u2019t had the same spark as Jibril (who, in classic RPG fashion, later becomes an ally) - and it makes one think they really could use an equally insane foil or antagonist to bring out their best. \\n\\n\r\nThe substance of NGNL itself is its style, and it works wonders thanks to its burlesque tone. The balance is extreme, but not much of a departure from Imaishi and Masaaki-directed works. What makes NGNL is different is how specific it is, how every stratagem is explained and everything happens for a reason. Which is why for NGNL to truly connect on an emotional level, it has to specifically dedicate time towards making the viewer care about the characters and the world they find themselves in. It struggles in this regard. Much of the direct characterization throughout these first twelve episodes of NGNL suffers from ubiquitous lack of meaningful development. To an extent, this was to be be expected due to the nature of the series, but some of the attempted subplots fall flat because of this. \\n\\n\r\nSteph is the most prominent contributor, because she serves as a foil for Sora and Shiro and should be an easiest character to relate to on a basic level (basically she's a fucking normie). However, her sobbing about her grandfather, the disgraced former king of who gambled his land away in hopes of future prosperity, is sappy at best and annoying at worst. Her inner back-and-forth of whether to trust Sora as a leader or not was painfully half-baked, contrived, and thoughtless. Moreover, it\u2019s difficult to care too much about Izuna\u2019s inner struggle about her sense of duty or Fiel\u2019s bond to Kurami when they\u2019re explored for a few scenes and pass by like a floating piece of debris in a hurricane. This can even apply to NGNL's more compelling and fun characters: take Jibril for example, a deserved fan favorite who shifts between (literally) drooling over the prospect of gaining precious knowledge to reminiscing about the days where she could indulge in her psychopathic tendencies of slaughtering anyone in her way. Sora and Shiro themselves have a quirk where their usually badass, composed personalities become useless and complete wrecks when they\u2019re away from each other. \\n\\n\r\nThis tendency to just throw schizoid personality traits out there and hope they stick is the most telling sign that thus far, NGNL has abandoned even barebones exposition. Random behavior is dismissed with the notion that every character acts with some form of inherent spontaneity instead of possessing a fluid train of thought. These developmental aspects are double-edged swords that inject off the wall personality to the series that adds to the fantasy, while also hinder the viewer from taking NGNL's actual narrative or the aforementioned subplots too seriously. We\u2019re left in the dark about relationships, individual vulnerabilities, and motivations. By consequence, a lot of the details dull the quality for this individual season but set up for reveals and more backstory later on. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of the worldbuilding and characterization itself is represented through the heightened sense of verticality, with rapidfire cut changes. This, along with Madhouse\u2019s high-contrast neon color palette and quirky artwork distinguishes Disboard as one of the most picturesque, eccentric, and effervescent isekai settings I've ever seen animated. Often, right after heavy action sequences full of zooming movements and aerial shots, the cinematography shifts to juxtapose our larger-than-life characters to an even more larger-than-life world. This imbalance creates a lingering sense that the characters are small and caged, giving the viewers the sense that someone (remember Tet?) is constantly watching, and there is much much more to the game that is yet to come. Furthermore, the voice acting especially for Sora, Shiro, and Jibril is bonkers and felt incredibly fitting for their characters. The BGM itself isn\u2019t a highlight, but it\u2019s solid throughout - playful or intense when it needs to be, whereas Konomi Suzuki\u2019s opening, This Game, with twinkling pianos and soaring vocals sets the mood, and I\u2019m definitely going to try to learn (and fail) how to play it. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s undeniable that NGNL has the scope and potential to be truly massive in every sense of the word. Seriously, the setup has every indication that this world-building could lead to a inordinately expansive and nuanced universe, much like other long-running light novel series such as Index, Spice and Wolf, or Mondaiji (similar premise also withstanding). Sora and Shiro are bent on challenging god, and you have every reason to believe they will. Still, it's disappointing that the season peaked at episode six, the shiratori match with Jibril and by the twelfth episode, much of the novelty has already begun wearing off. Yet despite the minor speed bump, the sense that there is so much potential with the world of Disboard never fizzles out and we\u2019re reminded of that with how the first season ends - with a cliffhanger materializing from thin air. Zero fucking warning on that, by the way. With many more volumes to adapt, things can only get bigger; whether they get better has yet to be seen. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: read the whole review pussy btw it\u2019s a ostentatiously fun/bizzare show that\u2019s probably not for everyone if they just don\u2019t get the gratification/fanservice/always winning/self-parody/otaku power fantasy stuff. still, mostly it\u2019s functionally a prologue and maybe the first few bosses of this bigger NGNL rpg that sets the script for following seasons/volumes so don't expect it to have any real juicy plot meat if you know what I'm sayin because it's served up undercooked here. but i can\u2019t say this enough: the shiratori game with Jibril was fucking awesome.",

            "content": "I don't normally write reviews, mainly cause I don't think that many people will be interested in my totally subjective opinion, but this time I decided to make an exception. Mainly cause I can't stand to see so many people slamming this series with the same repeating arguments, completely ignoring the positives.\r\nAs I've said, I have very much subjective and in many ways probably biased love for the series.  I assume it's mainly because it saved me from the rot of meaningless flashy series, where fan service replaces  story and various \"grabs\" are there instead of plot twists. But isn't this virtually thesame? I have to strongly disagree.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, lets get the initial impressions out of the way. Art here has a nice modern touch, clean graphics, tight animations and it's nice to see designers using after processing to add a style, not to obscure shabby production quality. Although I think style overall suits modern day setting more than fantasy world, making opening scene and city battle at the end of season most visually impressive. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter design is the only complaint I can rise here, mainly among humans. Not that it's bad, but somewhat samey. Good thing we have 15 more races to look at.\\n\\n\r\nNow, regarding the setting itself, I kinda love it. On surface it looks uninspired: yet another parallel world where main character gets wisped away to, fantasy races, magic, dragons and villains. Oh and there's a princess also, who falls in love with main character, but she's kind of tsundere. Oh and they live in her castle.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's what makes this one of my favorite series: the ability to take the most overused and boring setting, so dull, that Le Blanc de La Valli\u00e8re, Louise Fran\u00e7oise might confuse it for her homeworld, and twist it in to something crazy and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nYes, we had anime about games before, be it SAO, Log Horison, Ragnarok or //hack, but they all tried to bring real life in to game, while NGNL does the opposite: it brings the game back in to life. If anything, it's closer to Kaiji, just less depressing and unfair.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I really like about the subject, is that unlike majority of game related or themed anime, this one manages to appeal to gamers as a whole, instead of pandering to or focusing on Asian aspects of gaming, specifically their mmos and VNs. Yes, tehre's still influence, but it's not so absolute. I don't mind watching things like SAO and Log Horizon to better understand tropes and intricacies of Asian gaming, but for once I want something I can just enjoy and relate to.\\n\\n\r\nIt saddens me how few gamers I see around here, or at least it seems so, cause how else would one explain such widespread misunderstanding of setting and main focuses of the series. For me it's an amazing, impossible world, for once created by gamers, not just for gamers. It's as MCs said in the first episode: real world has no clearly defined rules or objectives and everyone makes whatever moves they want, i.e. just a shitty game.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a fantasy of any gamer to be unbeatable at everything, so it makes easy for me to relate to MCs. They also manage to avoid the oh so common trope that being transported in to a different world makes you slow and docile.  MCs get right to business abusing the world for their own gain and enjoyment and it's a breath of fresh air from typical goody two shoes I will protect you OJSB of a MC that we have so often. \\n\\n\r\nBut the one thing that can make or break series for me is humor. Will it make me laugh or cringe? Will I be bored enough to check how much of an episode  is left? Well, NGNL managed to do something anime has failed for me since Lucky Star: it made me literally laugh out loud every episode, to the point where my room mates would come over to check if I'm going insane or not.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to pinpoint exactly what made me like it so much, probably the combination of verbal humor with spot on body humor, references , selfish attitude and in-jokes between the siblings. That, combined with the general gaming theme made it easy to digest and relate.\\n\\n\r\nIf one would take the plot and development at face value, it would on impress much, a rather generic battle to save humanity and prove that they are not the weakest. But you need to move away from typical anime tropes to realize that it's not about humanity, beating the god or any other vague \"greater good\". This anime is really just about two siblings, gamers, who are having fun in a world they understand very well. Everything they do is to advance their own agenda.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I do have to mention though. Sound, overall, was serviceable, but what annoyed me the most was soundtrack. It felt... uninspired. Both in terms of opening/ending and music during the show itself. One would think that by this time directors understand the advantages of memorable music, but here it was mostly generic fantasy/fighting anime scores, completely alien to the nature of the show. I strongly feel that having some metal/electronic (or better both!) mash-ups would of suited gaming theme a lot more.  Not to mention that they have quite a few gadgets along with them, yet they rarely use them for anything than taking notes or reading books.\\n\\n\r\nOne final thing I need to cover is fan service. To be completely honest here, first time I've watched the series, I did not notice it at all. Considering that I'm not a fan of it normally, it was rather strange. It took me a second viewing to realize what was different. It fitted, which happens never. Both MCs lived in a world exposed to ungodly amounts of it, to the point where it became somewhat of a background thing. As a result they were using it for their own entertainment, as opposed of ham-fisted\"accidents\" that plague anime nowadays. It was also employed by them for their own need, be it to tease or to distract, as well as a  nice addition the their, honestly, rather unhealthy relationship. I can only wish that, if we have to have fan service, it would be done in similar, organic way. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have it, this is why I don't normally write reviews, I tend to get carried away.  As a conclusion, I would say that NGNL is often misunderstood for mediocre anime riding on populat tropes, but I see it as an amazing melding of Asian and western cultures. We learned to enjoy Asian quirks and their way of life, but this one hits it close to home, to a closer culture. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a must see anime for anyone, but you might not understand what it's trying to do, but that's normal with anime, isn't it? And if you consider yourself a gamer, it's a wonderful treat, something that rarely happens outside of youtube.",

            "content": "-Spoilers Ahead-\r\nHere's the obligatory premise of the show for this review because I'm assuming you can't read the Synopsis up there due to allergy or something: Sora and Shiro have tremendous gaming skills and are bored with the regular world. A message arrives for the siblings, and when they open their message, they are stunned to see the scenery around them change to a world they had never encountered before. They've been summoned by Tet to... \r\nYes, the premise is pretty much a carbon copy of Mondaiji-tachi. In fact, it's so similar that I had to actually check when the respective light novels were released.They're both about incredibly talented kids getting sucked into a different world because they're too special for boring human world, and they play \"games.\" Even the visuals are strikingly similar in that they're both incredibly colorful. But hey, you can't exactly be always original- Technically speaking, every show could be considered a carbon copy of some other show that came before, and being uncreative doesn't really detract from the quality of the show. That's not the problem here. The visuals and music are fine too, although it does overuse that one track a lot when the MC explains his plan. \\n\\n\r\nBut the visuals are the least of its problems- The two main characters, Sora and Shiro, are simply put, Stus. Everyone loves Stus as main characters, so why not? Izayoi from Problem Children was a huge Stu too, beating the shit out of everything with next to no effort, and these two are no different. They're just incredibly talented at everything and their only supposed weakness is that they have to be together at all times. Thankfully this weakness is actually never an issue except when it's relevant, and outside of that, it's played for comedic effects. And even if it ever would pose a serious problem, it's usually resolved by one of the two planning something out before the weakness actually happened in the first place, so it's just a pretend label. It doesn't make them any less of Stus. Unfortunately, many people seem to think this is actually a valid weakness, and therefore, doesn't make them Stus. It really isn't. \\n\r\nAt least they're not Tatsuya, right? \\n\\n\r\nThey're not the only problem, of course. Stephanie Dora is this incredibly obnoxious character who pretty much exists for a comic relief. In fact, literally every episode involves making fun of this character for being stupid, and it never ends. So much that even the fanbase now associates her name with the term \"stupidity.\" Making fun of a character for being stupid is funny the first time. Maybe the second and third. Not so much after when it becomes an established fact. \"Ha, the sky is blue! So funny!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Jibril. Her introduction to the series is just so terribly done that it's almost offensive. There's no foreshadowing whatsoever to her existence, and when it's brought up, it just turns into \"Oh, Steph was stupid. Guess that's why she didn't tell us about this character that didn't exist until this point in plot.\" And after she's introduced, she's mostly written as an exposition character that just explains all the world building for the watchers instead of letting the viewers figure things out by themselves. This also serves to mediate Steph's complete uselessness as a character because the author realized it wouldn't be a nice idea to have a recurring side character whose only purpose was to be a comic relief. \\n\\n\r\nI think simply claiming they're Stus isn't really enough to convince anyone, so I'll be more elaborate. But I can't exactly explain that in detail without explain this other thing. And that other thing is the title's namesake; Games! \\n\\n\r\nMaybe the series was trying to be clever with its title \"No Game No Life\" because there hardly is anything that can be categorized as an actual \"game\" in this series. The biggest problem with these  so-called games can be summarized like this: \"Oops, I win.\"\\n\\n\r\nSince most of the episodes have games in them, I'll just explain how each was handled- \\n\r\nFirst episode doesn't explain how Sora won the game. He just did, and you're supposed to accept it. Third episode is a chess game where the rules don't really exist. It's supposed to technically play like a chess, but there really are no established rules- If you're the main character and give a speech, apparently you're rigged to win. Am I supposed to be impressed yet? Fourth episode doesn't have a game, but it breaks character- Sora and Shiro are supposed to be scared of crowds, but in this episode, they get over it pretty quickly as if that was never a problem in the first place. Then they proceed to give an incredibly cliche speech about how the weak can become strong. A speech that's not even really reflective, since Sora and Shiro were never \"weak\" in terms of their gaming prowess, or inspiring since the speech was practically nothing. The entirety of fifth episode is Steph being called an idiot, and a sequence of games that just follows what the series did with the first episode. Sora just \"wins\" them all, and the few ones that he does explain how he won, is just completely out of some puzzle book. Brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nSixth episode is where Jibril is introduced, and it's sadly considered one of the \"better\" episodes in the series. The game here could have been well done, but it's really just a mess. The game's victory hinges on the fact that Jibril does not know about the planet's structure. How could have Sora known this? What if Tet's magic world planet had a different structure from Earth? This is even before Sora had access to Elkia's library, so he wouldn't have known that wasn't common knowledge. Furthermore, Elkia isn't exactly the most knowledgeable nation- He claims that he supposedly figured out in the middle of a game by seeing how she reacted, but she could've been just as easily pretending. But it just so happens that she doesn't know about his win condition. It's a victory that just happened with assumptions and guesses, and apparently this is supposed to make the MC look like a genius. Really?\\n\\n\r\nBreaking off a bit from this pretend game nonsense, seventh episode manages to be the best episode in the series- Instead of Sora pretending he's smart over something he got completely lucky over, the audience get decently written characterization and not as forced exposition. That about sums up every compliment I had for this show. Everything afterwards just builds up to a very disappointing finale- Though, not before informing the watchers that Shiro is definitely helpless without Sora. Except not really, because Sora is still there, you see. What happens is that Shiro is supposed to play a piece on a board game that she can't see. This board game was being played by Sora and an another character. But apparently since she's a \"genius,\" she can predict where he's going to place the pieces, and know exactly where to put it. Except that, the game wasn't called Solitaire. I'm sorry, but it's logically impossible to exactly predict the game state of Othello from knowing just half of the game. Of course the show doesn't explain how this was done. It's just brushed off as Shiro being a genius and knowing everything about Sora, and that was the key to victory. It's all the more offensive when you realize that the victory of this game is what also later helps Sora to win the final game in the series in a domino effect. \\n\\n\r\nThe finale attempts to make Steph seem relevant by having her pull the final trigger. Too bad she didn't actually do anything. Sora and Shiro planned her to do it! Genius! This last episode's supposed \"moral lesson\" is completely insensible too. It keeps repeating the line \"when was the last time you had fun playing a game?\" If people are putting something big like continents and people's lives at stake, it'd be borderline psychopathic to find fun from playing a game putting that at risk. I don't get the \"moral lesson\" here. Is this show telling me to completely disregard everything except having fun? I guess Russian Roulette was a popular party game too. Possible bullets to the head? YES! GOTY! 10/10 IGN. Why aren't you having fun? Are you stupid or something?\\n\\n\r\nThis particular game is also flawed in that their winning strategy also hinges on the fact that the enemy does not notice something that they later claim to be able to notice. Good thing they didn't the first time! Those stupid warbeasts! Even though an entire continent is at stake, they can't even put up that much of a caution! Again, this is not planning. It's luck. Sora gambles, and wins. You can't just win the lottery, make a smug face, and call yourself a genius. But this is what this show does. Every single time. It's not even pretentious in a sense that it's trying to do something remotely clever- Because it's not even fucking remotely clever. \\n\\n\r\nI also don't understand why Sora/Shiro are separate characters. Shiro is just literally Sora, without the smug attitude, being a fanservice bait, and doesn't have much of a personality outside of being incredibly clingy. The show also plays out their relationship far too much to the point that it's creepy. But then again, that's what these shows seem to do these days: Incest is ok, because they're not actually blood-related siblings. This show also constantly hammers in the point about how \"Blanks can never lose\" and that both siblings make up Blanks to an extent that it's incredibly annoying. Of course they can never lose- They're the fucking MCs and the plot bends itself backwards to LET them win. Furthermore, you pretty much know that Sora and Shiro will win no matter what. They always bet something to the point that if they lose, the series would probably be over, so you know that they can't lose. There is no sense of anticipation or whatsoever. Then after winning through some poorly explained method which this show constantly nudges you about how clever it was being, Sora just makes that same fucking smug grin.  \\n\\n\r\nSo yes. The biggest problems with the show supposedly about games is the games themselves, and the characters playing them. The series also constantly teases about how exciting things were before Tet became the absolute God. It's almost like it's self-aware. Lovely. \\n\\n\r\nThis series could've been better if they didn't constantly play these games where cheating is more encouraged than making actual strategies within the game's boundaries. See, games are fun to watch because you want to see what the characters can do within their own boundaries to actually win in a clever manner. It's also fun to watch because you don't really know who will win. But due to the whole retarded \"Cheating is fine as long as it's not caught\" rule in the show, the author is given the freedom to not write anything remotely intelligent. All he needs to do is just say Sora won because he did something that was outside of game's design and that just made him win despite the fact that it would be near impossible in practice. And hopefully it's just as impossible for this show to get a second season. \\n",

            "content": "No Game No Life(NGNL) is a wish-fulfillment show in which the protagonists are given an entirely arbitrary world in which they are the best at what governs that world: games. Wish-fulfillment, you say? Yeah, I am grouping this one up there with SAO, and I don't think I'm in the wrong when doing so. I mean, Sora's backstory is literally him getting awful grades and not giving a shit about what his parents say. It's the classic angsty mentality \"me vs. the world\" or \"nobody understands me\" type of mentality that many adolescents feel they are driven into, and this show plays off of that.\\n\\n\r\nIt revels in its otaku culture, but what's interesting is that it's actually quite self-aware of what it's doing. The show constantly makes light-hearted jokes about otaku hikkimori NEET or whatever you want to call it culture, and so it is clearly very aware of the innate flaws these people face socially and mentally. HOWEVER, it fails to self reflect in every way possible. It clearly can identify problems in its vile nature, but it only wants to make a joke out of it. Sort of like \"I don't care what society thinks, in fact, I don't even want to participate in your system.\" which is kind of what Sora's mentality towards his parents is anyways. What do I mean by self-reflect? Well, the only NEET/hikkimori show I even think is good is Welcome to the NHK, so that gives you an idea of what kind of catharsis I'm looking for.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, it's supposed to grip you with intense games. It's supposedly even more exciting because you're allowed to cheat in these games. At first glance, this seems like it makes it even harder for our god-like protagonist, but when you think about it... not really. Because magic is allowed, many shortcuts can be taken in how exactly the author writes about how Sora/Shiro beat the enemy. The classic example is the chess game. That wasn't even about games. It looked to me like lazy writing. With magic, it becomes easier for the writer to come up with ways for the protagonists to win. The writer doesn't even have to know jack shit about game theory, as he can avoid the subject entirely. This show is the kind of show that actual manga/anime about game theory like Liar Game and Kaiji will laugh at and shit on. This links to another problem I had with his show...\\n\\n\r\nEverything pans out too perfectly. Once again, at first glance, many of these games look as though they are won through wit, intellect, deduction, logic, etc. etc. etc. When you really think about it, there ARE actually quite a few loopsholes or unanswered explanations in this show when it comes to its games. However, the story always pans out to make Sora/Shiro look like gods. I have a problem with this but I can certainly see someone enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, I don't really have any complaints. I thought there was definitely too much fanservice, but it could differ. People will say things like \"but every show  some fanservice!\". No, not really. Some shows don't need to use fanservice and moe to drive up their BD preorders. Some shows care about the story/characters alone. See: Mushishi, Tatami Galaxy, or Ping Pong, which aired in the same season as NGNL.\\n\\n\r\nThis show doesn't really put forward any clear themes, ok actually the only one it does is the angsty rebellious one I get from Sora/Shiro's backstory combined with the fact that this show is about how overpowered they are in this arbitrary world. It doesn't meaningfully resonate whatsoever, and normally the \"dumb entertaining fun\" shows get a 5, because they really are your average entertaining fun shows, but in this case the intrinsic problems I had with its setup and the fact that the games weren't all that great for me lead me to rate it a 4/10. I'll admit 2 or 3 episodes were decently entertaining, but other than that I'd much rather be watching a serious show just because that's more my taste.\\n\\n",

            "content": "No Game No Life is a clear example for the anime community of overconfidence. It's a story of Sora and Shiro, an expert gaming duo, sent to another world where everything is settled through games. While this may appear to be simply following the hype of Sword Art Online as other animes have done, this is actually a much more advanced and original premise than meets the eye. \r\nUnfortunately, the shows only aspect in its favor is the story's usage of different and unique games in order to settle disputes. The rest of the anime leaves much to be desired, simply applying clear attempts togain popularity and providing poorly written characters to drag along the plot.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering there is not much to discuss as far as the story without providing spoilers, the most important reason as to why I do not recommend this anime would be due to its excuse for characters.\\n\\n\r\nStarting off, we have our 1st protagonist, Sora. Sora is Shiro's older step-brother who is practically designed to be unlikable. While many anime characters are perverted in nature, Sora is just down right despicable. Using his skill as a gamer he forces a girl to fall in love with him and with the help of Shiro, proceeds to provide her with belittling comments and sexual harassment on a level that can never be justified. Furthermore, rather than actually establishing a unique and developed character for Sora, he's written as a clear Lelouch Lamperouge copy, mimicking the star of Code Geass' intellectual prowess without having the same charisma that makes a fan of Code Geass love the protagonist. It's this sloppy writing that exposes the empty characters we are seeing on screen.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto our next gaping flaw in No Game No Life we have Shiro, Sora's younger and impressively less likable sister. While Sora at least had some semblance of a character, Shiro is just a part of the show. She does things that help the plot sure, but she's not deep in the slightest. Her only noticeable trait aside from being a gamer is that she is overly protective of her brother. She constantly gets worked up when another female interacts with Sora, going as far as to take one girl's clothing, including underwear, and having her dress up as a dog before being tied to a pole in front of the townspeople. It's these types of moments that make No Name No Life so mediocre. It's having our main female character be abusive to another relevant member of the cast without any sort of reprimanding that makes her painful to even watch. Such actions on her part make her extremely unlikable and unfortunately this is her only aspect to her character with noting. Other than this, she's just a piece of cardboard that can somehow speak.\\n\\n\r\nNo Game No Life is not the greatest anime of all time; in fact its not even good. Quite honestly, this is one of the most overrated animes I've ever seen. If you want to see people have an engaging battle of the minds, watch either Death Note or Code Geass. If you want to watch overly unnecessary fan-service and some of the worst written characters in anime, only then can I ever recommend No Game No Life. While the games themselves are an engaging part of the overall experience, the rest is a train wreck that shows that a good concept still needs strong writing to be successful.",

            "content": "It's not uncommon for one to wish themselves out of a certain situation. Whether it be from an instinctual desire for a grander lifestyle or the pursuit of happiness, one's desires vary from person to person. This may also be what appeals to many who are fans of roleplaying or out of body experiences. The desire for what one cannot have has driven many to madness, and this topic has been used by many forms of entertainment over the years. What No Game No Life does with this topic is shows what can be accomplished when the main character takes what he has learned andapplies it to a world devoid of impossibilities. And when it comes to a world of impossibilities, there's no one better qualified to conquer it than those who follow their head instead of their heart. Actually, it probably wouldn't matter either way.\\n\\n\r\nTo accurately pinpoint exactly what No Game No Life is, one could describe it as two siblings trying to overthrow the god of a fantasy world after beating him in a game of chess. But overthrowing a god is no easy task. Firstly, they must overthrow the entire world. Whether taking over the fantasy world will even accomplish their goal is based on a presumption the main character conceived. But he's never been wrong once since entering the fantasy world, so it'd be better to go along with it. The presumptions of anything logically possible play into this world of impossibilities. No Game No Life makes it clear early on that anything worth thinking about doesn't belong in the games played in the fantasy world. Games can be won through ridiculous means. The games that are played are all conveniently geared towards the main characters' strengths. With each and every game, the characters inch closer and closer to their goal of overtaking a god. Despite everything, No Game No Life's progression is very straightforward. It doesn't try to take itself beyond the stars and it doesn't try to meddle in any unnecessary sub-plots. Most attention is dedicated to one singular mission, as stated above.\\n\\n\r\nAs one of the rules of the fantasy world, the denizens of said world must have fun and play games together. At its core, No Game No Life is just fun and games. When the characters aren't plotting for world domination, they're making jokes and pop culture references. The attempts at comedy during the course of the series are mostly reliant on exaggerated reactions and gratuitous fan service. While they can produce a snicker at times, it mostly feels like a cheap trick more than anything. The fan service usually comes at the expense of the female members of the cast, as a majority of the cast is, indeed, female. Whether it be from the results of a game or a part of the games themselves, it's safe to say that clothing will be removed in some fashion or another. The balance between silly and serious tends to lean more towards silly more often than not. This doesn't harm the validity of the plot much, as the plot is hard to take seriously regardless.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't take a veteran to be able to recognize the faults within the characters. With almost each and every character, there's something off about either their presentation or personality, something that goes deeper than how it appears. With a character such as Sora, the main character and only male among the main cast, you get a lanky, angsty kid who's supposedly too smart to appreciate his own world, so he does whatever he can to entertain himself. Once in the fantasy world, he quickly applies the rules to his situation and takes full advantage of them with one fell swoop. With every challenge, he dominates the opponent with the arrogance of a true king. By being nothing special socially, he acquires the admiration of all of his suitors without even trying, yet was unpopular in the real world. This implies that he could be the world's greatest human being, he just didn't care to put in the effort in his original life. Every quality of his character screams of a self-insert and moans of wish fulfillment. They combat this by giving him faults, like being a pervert or being unable to handle the outside world. But by doing this, they're making him all the more perfect. No one is perfect, so let's make him pseudo-perfect. It's perfectly despicable.\\n\\n\r\nOther members of the major cast aren't as loathsome as Sora, but still fall under the category of cliche or fan service, especially Sora's sister, Shiro. She's small, cute, quiet, and has an abnormal hair color. She also has an insatiable appetite for her brother's affection. All of these traits were manufactured especially for moe. And the icing on the cake is that she's adopted, so her desire for her brother's affection is excused, but still unwelcome. Shiro is essentially walking fan service. Stephanie Dola, the klutz, is one of two major characters born in the fantasy world. She is constantly teased for lacking the intelligence that all other characters share, despite being fairly intelligent in other matters. She is the source of most of the comedy and the fan service in the show, which makes her role within the show feel more shallow. As a character, she contributes little and goes nowhere in terms of growth, making her little more than a stock character. The last of the major characters is Jibril, a fairy-like creature who's thirst for knowledge is as creepy as Sora's expressions. She's more useful than Stephanie, and has a more likable personality, too. Of all the characters, she feels the most human, despite not being human. And as a member of the female race, she's subject to more fan service than one could ask for. Whether this matters is strictly based on the individual viewer's taste.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that was apparent with No Game No Life was its style of presentation. The artwork is reminiscent of Kamisami no Anai Nichiyoubi, whose creamy atmosphere created an effect of dreary depression and bubbly optimism. No Game No Life's art style is similar to a degree, as the brightness is on par with the sun's rays. The palette of color seemed to favor those with a calming, yet alluring power. Purple, maroon, light blue, and dark red are the colors that stand out most while watching this title, and their combination makes for a stunning outcome. Unfortunately, this type of presentation can be a little overbearing at times, as the lighting can sometimes make the characters blend in with the background or appear a tad too bright. The animation itself is one to be praised. It's charming, efficient, and bold; three things that can make an average anime look fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, No Game No Life is interesting. The plot isn't anything as spectacular as it presents it and the characters are atrociously written, but it at least looks like a modern epic. The characters may be flat, but their interactions are humorous at times, granted they aren't playing games. Regardless of all of the flaws, it's entertaining to the highest degree, granted those who view it aren't too cynical. It has the qualities to succeed, it just uses them through means of popularity rather than quality. If anything, if one doesn't care to continue viewing No Game No Life, they can imagine themselves in a world outside of their grasp, similar to those within the series. It wouldn't hurt.",

            "content": "\"There's no way to know the rules or the goal, yet there are 7 billion players making whatever moves they want. There are no parameters and no way to even know the genre. This world is just a crappy game.\"\r\n \u2012 Sora, No Game No Life\r\nIs it really that bad? Real life is a wide open sandbox game with the most realistic physics and graphics in existence. \r\nNo Game No Life is a show that is full of games and tactics. Just one problem: they don't work. And I don't mean some small loopholes here and there. The very foundation of the tactics requires knowingthings that are beyond realistic human knowledge. As a result, there is zero tension in this show. This is not Kasparov vs Deep Blue, this is playing against a psychic who can list every move you will make before the game has even begun. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is already ridiculous. A pair of NEET shut-in siblings, Sora and Shiro, are known online as invincible players who have never lost in any game whatsoever, no matter the genre or how luck-based the game is. \\n\\n\r\n...Yes, really. That isn't an exaggeration; they are completely invincible.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the show, the viewer learns how they achieve this: by being omniscient. They know how anyone will react in any situation. They know what moves their opponent will make without seeing the game board. They know what words their opponent will use in a word game. They can figure out the inner workings of a video game the first time they are playing. They know how flipped coins will land. \\n\\n\r\n\"There is no such thing as luck in this world. Rules, prerequisites, psychological states... There are any number of invisible factors that combine to produce an unpredictable but inevitable result. The victor of a game is decided before it even begins. There is no chance.\"\\n\r\n \u2012 Sora explaining why his tactics work\\n\\n\r\n...Hang on a second. If the result is \"unpredictable,\" then that is what normal people usually mean by luck. When people say that e.g. poker has luck, they are not referring to some quantum fluctuations but simply the lack of knowledge of the order of the cards. So while it's a nice play on semantics, it does very little to actually justify Sora's tactics. For him there is nothing unpredictable.\\n\\n\r\nHow exactly are we supposed to emulate their tactics in real life? We can't, can we? The whole appeal in something like Liar Game is that the tactics actually work for actual human beings. Of course there is no limit to what you can do in a piece of fiction if the author makes a character omniscient, but where is the fun in watching something like that? Calling it wish fulfillment is an understatement.\\n\\n\r\nSo if it isn't about tactics, what is the show really about? Fanservice with the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the skull. Bath scenes, breast grabs, tentacles, incest, animal girl fetishes, and obsession over a 11-year-old's panties should come as no surprise, but in addition we have nipple-erasing magic, boob-enlarging magic, and dragging a practically naked girl through the streets on a leash as \"the dog for the day.\" \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, if you aren't into nonstop fanservice, it gets tedious really fast. Even in the middle of a game, the characters are just as interested in fanservice as winning. The jokes are all about boobs, panties, and the like. The dialogue includes such gems as \"I'm a healthy young man, you know? I've got sexual needs, and sexual needs, and sexual needs! And even sexual needs!\" The show is trying to appeal to the most primitive aspects in our savannah monkey brains, assuming that awkwardly shoving mammary glands at the viewer is enough to constitute a well-written show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is also full of references. It could work in theory, but too often the references feel so arbitrary that they break the flow of the scenes. For example, what does Legend of the Galactic Heroes have to do with a harem-themed first-person shooter (now there's a natural combo to begin with)? Nothing, but they just couldn't find a way to shoehorn it in otherwise. We get an endless flood of these references, as if ticking boxes on some checklist. Where's the fun in that? It feels like a calculated effort rather than a natural creative product, as if the writers were reading marketing surveys and trend analysis charts while watching 5-second Youtube clips of famous games and anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, back to the plot. Sora and Shiro are cast into a fantasy world where everything is decided by games, courtesy of the local god, Tet. They quickly decide that they don't even want to return to Earth and instead want to become #1 in this world by beating everyone, Tet included. \\n\\n\r\nWhy? To help end oppression and suffering?\\n\\n\r\n...No, of course not. What were you thinking? It's to increase their harem and satisfy their fetishes. This is why taking over the kingdom of animal girls is a top priority.\\n\\n\r\nAny politics or social commentary is handled in the most superficial way possible, reduced to little more than a footnote. I assume there wouldn't have been enough time for bouncing boobs otherwise. Sure, they talk about the weak defeating the strong with their wisdom, but they just leave it at that. Now, guess what, it's easy to say you can beat the strong if you are omniscient. How about you demonstrate realistic means to achieve it?\\n\\n\r\nAnd what was wrong with Earth anyway? In the quote I mentioned earlier, Sora called it a crappy game because there's no way to know the rules or the goal, but is it really any different for this fantasy world? It may revolve around games, but there is no truly universal or objective goal there either. It's just a place with different laws of physics.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, the plot is also left severely unfinished, so don't expect any real conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nThe following subsections are part of the story, but they deserve their own categories.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe games:\\n\\n\r\nAh yes, the main selling point of the show. I honestly liked some of the smaller games, such as the modified rock-paper-scissors and \"when will this bird take off,\" but the alleged main attractions not so much. Many of them aren't particularly tactical to begin with, and the remaining ones are won through simply knowing things you can't realistically know.\\n\\n\r\nFirst-person shooter:\\n\r\nThey can perfectly decipher the movement patterns of the NPCs the first time they are playing, as well as how their opponent will react. I mean, really: they predict both of these up to a few dozen pixels so that they can line a shot that they planned minutes in advance. Oh, and this FPS game is harem-themed, so much time and effort will be spent on trying to strip people by shooting their clothes. Predictably enough.\\n\\n\r\nMaterialization shiritori:\\n\r\nHoping that the other player will use a specific word simply because you used it at one point... The show itself acknowledges that this was a gamble. So one question: if the success of the protagonists is built on luck, why are we supposed to believe they are geniuses? Oh, and it's completely natural that this fantasy world has similar laws of physics to ours, down to the subatomic level. After all, that's what fantasy worlds are known for.\\n\\n\r\nOthello:\\n\r\nThe board becomes invisible, but a third party can join mid-game and figure out where all the pieces are by guessing all the moves taken so far. Sounds legit.\\n\\n\r\nChess:\\n\r\nChess is a game known for its deep strategy. Well, we can't have any of that, so instead it's played by giving the pieces motivational speeches. And by speeches, I mean lines like: \\n\r\n\"The one true, unchanging righteousness in this world is cuteness! Cute makes right!\"\\n\r\n\"By my authority as king, anyone who fights valiantly in this battle will earn the right to bang any woman they like!\"\\n\\n\r\nImagine if Lelouch was giving a speech to his revolutionary force, and instead of appealing to justice he would praise cuteness and promise women as war loot. Indeed, the problem here is not so much that the protagonists are omniscient but rather that the game isn't particularly strategic to begin with, if you can even call this a legit game. Sora, if you dislike the real world because the rules are vague, why is this chess game not a problem?\\n\\n\r\nAnd did the soldiers even get their women afterwards? Sora, you cheap bastard.\\n\\n\r\nCoin Flip:\\n\r\n...Yeah. There is actually a twist to this too, but it doesn't make it any more plausible.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe setting:\\n\\n\r\nThe setting makes no sense even within its own rules. Tet has set in place ten pledges that supposedly tell everything about how the world and its games are governed. I'll just copy-paste them here:\\n\\n\r\n1. All murder, war, and robbery is forbidden in this world. \\n\r\n2. All conflict in this world will be resolved through games.\\n\r\n3. In games, each player will bet something that they agree is of equal value. \\n\r\n4. As long as it doesn't violate pledge three, anything may be bet, and any game may be played. \\n\r\n5. The challenged party has the right to decide the rules of the game. \\n\r\n6. Any bets made in accordance with the pledges must be upheld. \\n\r\n7. Conflicts between groups will be conducted by designated representatives with absolute authority. \\n\r\n8. Being caught cheating during a game is grounds for an instant loss. \\n\r\n9. In the name of god, the previous rules may never be changed. \\n\r\n10. Let's all have fun and play together!\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to guess that there's no way such a short and vague set of rules can work in practice. And indeed, it turns out the authors simply can't handle them with any kind of consistency or in-universe plausibility, and any attempts to explain these problems away simply result in ruining the whole point of the setting and making the world's inhabitants look like imbeciles. Let me be a rules lawyer here for a while because apparently nobody in this fantasy world is. \\n\\n\r\n1) \"Everything is decided by games\"? Nah.\\n\\n\r\nNobody can force you to do anything unless you agreed to it in a game? Wrong. Guess what constitutes a group for rule 7 when it comes to countries? Race, as in species. Apparently you don't have to lose any game to be subject to the whims of this representative of absolute authority. He can bet all your land or even your life by betting the race piece. By the way, none of this is included in the pledges, so it's an implicit rule the author added to keep the story going.\\n\\n\r\nThis pretty efficiently ruins the setting, which is presented as a situation where the most talented can take charge of their own lives without having to fear violence or theft. But in reality, each race is living under authoritarian rule where you can lose your life on a whim due to no fault of your own. I know Tet made this system to replace genocidal wars, but was this the best he could come up with?\\n\\n\r\n\"But you can just challenge the representative to a game to take over!\" Nope, he can just throw an impossible game at you. And everyone who is not the representative would face a massive risk, which would strain society's capacity to function.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, banning robbery doesn't sound fair after you realize how arbitrary ownership is. Some people start with no coins to their name and others are living comfortably in their palaces. Tet, have you ever heard of this guy called Karl Marx? Look him up. That being said, there's nothing forcing people to agree to any transactions or acknowledge any existing currency, so they could simply have the rich starve to death if they liked.\\n\\n\r\n2) People are too often acting as if the pledges did not exist\\n\\n\r\nPeople are too often acting normally, as if the rules did not exist. People go to work as usual and obey the law and the government as usual. We are presented with a society that by all sense shouldn't work the way it does. You can't have both \"everything is decided by games\" and normal society at the same time. If the representative can achieve this... well, then it just ruins the setting, like I was saying.\\n\\n\r\nIn this world there is even hereditary slavery. Why not run away? Of course not, they will beat you up... oh, wait. Also, it can't be that they have gambled away their freedom because it's hereditary. You might try to say, \"The representative can just order them to be slaves.\" Not when the slaves are of another race, and it would destroy any shred of fairness these rules have left.\\n\\n\r\nAnd some countries are apparently democracies. I suppose if the representative can be two people, it can also be an institution... I guess. I'm probably giving way too much credit here; it's more likely the writers forgot about the setting again. \\n\\n\r\n3) Why do people agree to slanted games in the first place?\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest head-scratcher of all. Your country doesn't have to lose territory. Just don't agree to any slanted games. Are they all complete imbeciles? If you are challenged, you can likewise simply choose games where you are sure to win.\\n\\n\r\nWhy didn't the cabinet ministers refuse when Sora asked them to play a game where he wins by default? Yeah, just try to wrap your head around that one. Apparently you can just force people to lose by default. If this is something the representative can do, he could simply order them without playing a game, unless there is some kind of ridiculously specific implicit clause somewhere. \\n\\n\r\n...Screw this, it's obvious the writers just didn't care.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nSora and Shiro: They are inseparable to the point that they freak out when they are placed in different rooms. And I mean that literally. So it's only fitting that I deal with them together. \\n\\n\r\nSora's main purpose in life, other than winning games, is extending his harem and witnessing as much fanservice as humanly possible. Kind of like the show itself. Judging by his portrayal, we are supposed to be proud too. Shiro is a supergenius, as evidenced by the totally legit random equations she writes sometimes. Oh, and she is in love with her brother to satisfy the obligatory \"incest subplot\" quota.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, do you know why they were shut-ins? Because they were literally afraid of stepping through their front door. You see, Sora and Shiro are fine with any form of social interaction if they are in a game. In fact, they are genius negotiators. However, they become helpless the moment they step into the real world. But somehow they are fine in this game-filled fantasy world, even though the world itself is not a game. Basically:\\n\\n\r\nCrowded streets of a fantasy world -> They're fine\\n\r\nEmpty streets of the real world -> They fall into a catatonic state\\n\\n\r\nPlausible human psychology, right? And it really is the streets, not the people. They try both of the mentioned combinations in the show. Sometimes it tries to assert they are really afraid of people, but this is very rare and inconsistent anyway, so it's literally the streets that are the problem. \\n\\n\r\nStephanie: Fanservice, and also standing there to be laughed at for her stupidity and to let Sora and Shiro provide exposition.\\n\\n\r\nJibril: More fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nTet: Barely appears. Has tons of free time, which he refuses to use to help the residents of his world because games are that much cooler than having a functional society. Why is he portrayed as benevolent again?\\n\\n\r\nOther characters: Who cares? They only exist for fanservice or to lose to the protagonists, or are practically irrelevant. \\n\\n\\n\r\nA few words about the technical aspects:\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nDepends on how much you like fanservice and psychedelic neon colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nPretty standard. Nothing really stood out that much as far as the soundtrack and voices were concerned.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nThere is some enjoyment found in pointing out all the flaws in their tactics and the broader setting. Kind of like this review. You might think this show could be so bad it's good, but it's only barely. The show is too confident in its dysfunctional tactics, and many aspects of the show feel like a calculated ratings grab.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nThis show is a thoroughly artificial experience, a seemingly cynical attempt to cash in on the consumer. Their approach was simple enough: shove in as much wish fulfillment, references and fanservice as humanly possible and wait for the money to flow in.",

            "content": "Life is like a game, if you play your cards right, then you\u2019ll win. Perhaps this is more if a metaphorical statement but it is how No Game No Life (NGNL) is constructed as such. Well, not initially but in the mysterious world of Disboard, everything is determined by game \u2013 including your life. But first, we need to trace back a bit. This is because NGNL is based off a light novel of the same name focusing on two main characters and siblings as they conquer through Disboard and become Gods of their world. It\u2019s a game like they have never played before.\r\nWritten byJapanese-Brazilian author Yu Kamiya, the show adapts itself as a fantasy adventure. But unlike a show that takes place in some open world environment, NGNL takes place in a virtual realm full of wonders. And from this world, we meet hikikomori siblings Sora and Shiro. The two are known for their abilities in the gaming world as part a legendary group known as \u201cBlank\u201d (\u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f). Initially, they are considered unbeatable, so much that they are bored with their existence. Fate ties them one day after beating against a mysterious chess player earns them a trip to the Disboard world. \\n\\n\r\nA journey into NGNL will feel a bit anomalous. Think of it as trying to beat a video game but that you are not the one playing but rather as the actual player. For Sora and Shiro, this should initially be a walk in the park for their skills. But all is not as simple with the mechanics and rules in the Diaboard world. There are many concepts such as the \u201cExceed\u201d categorized by 16 different races. The Imanity, the most humanoid of all the races, become a source of prejudice for their weaknesses. As such, the show portrays them as underdogs. However, we have Sora and Shiro to bring back honor and glory to their race. Thus, the show crafts itself as a way of progressing and experimental journey. We witness the siblings\u2019 ascension and rise to the top. Their ultimate goal is to beat Tet, the creator of the world in order to become the One True God. From a perspective point, it\u2019s easy to tell what the show is trying to do with such a premise. There are vast potential development for the characters, world building, and dynamics of its rules. While it seems like one big challenge to tackle for gamers, the show portrays it more than that. Because for those rules, there\u2019s a certain degree of ways to bypass such restrictions. The show depicts itself as more of an experimental product with Sora and Shiro being the professors. Only of course, they also come into this world as gamers, fight with a gaming image, and bring pride to what they fight for. It\u2019s a journey beyond just saving some princess from a castle or win some fame.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to judge the first episode since the show slowly draws itself out with its concepts and characters. But for starters, the main sibling duo of Sora and Shiro is not your usual or typical pair of brother and sister. They are gamers, and while not professional demonstrates a status of unparalleled levels. But what really makes them stand out is the way that they complement each other with their abilities making them nearly omniscient. And unlike most siblings, they have a very dynamic relationship. Neither of them treats each other as superior or inferior but instead on equal standing. Throughout the series, it\u2019s clearly shown that they care deeply for one another. One instance shows Shiro\u2019s deep concern when she finds out that Sora was not with her anymore. Similarly, whenever they are apart, they display the traditional or perhaps stereotypical attributes of a NEET. The focus on the sibling twins is not their development but rather their characters. It\u2019s straight-forward but at the same time unconventional. The gap age difference between the duo might suggest that their skills differ. Yet, they show explicitly their skills individually and collectively to be able to carry the torch to victory. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout their journey to become Gods, the siblings encounter a variety of characters that joins them in their crusade. Joining them includes humans such as Stephanie Dola, also simply known as \u201cSteph\u201d. The show depicts her as a scapegoat after losing to the twins. Her role becomes more like a servant as the siblings adds her on their list of conquered objectives, literally. Then, there\u2019s a more playful Jibril that also becomes somewhat of a scapegoat. But unlike Steph, she\u2019s portrayed as an energetic oddball. NGNL portrays all four of these characters like they are crusaders to fight through the Disboard world. Furthermore, the show often likes to make fun of its own characters by their image and characteristics. For instance, Steph becomes a meme in the show for her master/dog relationship with the siblings. After being a subject to an unexpected order, Steph can be viewed not such as a scapegoat but as a play toy. And really, that\u2019s what their journey becomes like \u2013 a game where they play their way to victory whether it\u2019d be utilizing their minds or through cheating; anything to win because that\u2019s what it matters. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the serious nature of the siblings\u2019 goal to conquer God, the show often makes fun of itself with its characters, concepts, and even references/gags to deliver entertainment. Throughout the show, characters break through the boundaries of logic whether it\u2019d be in chess, rock-paper-scissors, physics, or just gaming itself to unimaginative levels. They create the idea that \u2018games with rules are meant to be broken\u2019. And from my perspective, it\u2019s fun and a blast to get out of. After all, it\u2019s not usually fun to watch someone else play a game than playing it yourself. Yet, this show can deliver a way where you almost feel like you are part of their quest to conquer the world. Furthermore are the concepts and dialogues. Even the various references from other popular cultures can spawn some laughter if noticed. Then, there\u2019s also iconic speeches, misleading dialogues, and gags all ties in to craft NGNL\u2019s unconventional image. Through this execution, the show explicitly presents game formulas beyond just playing for fun. This should have been obvious anyways since the show likes to take daring risks. And although these risks can be appealing, it can also be controversial. The way some characters behave are borderline inappropriate, die-hard, and become a wish- fulfillment fantasy. Through its style, the show also desperately saturates characters and scenes with fan service. Some can feel a bit uncomfortable especially for characters such as Shiro or implied animal innuendos in the case of Steph. It feels irrational and unoriginal with circle of clich\u00e9s most explicitly fueled by the dialogues with its characters and incest undertones. Even the plot/premise itself has some tastes of unoriginality when compared to recent shows such as Problem Children, Accel World, or Log Horizon. Only for NGNL, it\u2019s more about just beating the game through unpredictable outcomes. Some other quirks about the show might involve its romance as at least two characters show interest in Shiro. But most times, the show borders on a harem-esque route as he makes impressions on the ladies. In retrospect, don\u2019t expect any genuine romance development but rather teases without nothing more than a simple foreplay.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse does it again once again with its successful cultural and visual display. The world of Diaboard is illustrated with layers on top of layers of fantasy that destroys any sense of realism but creates that credible mood of being stuck in a virtual realm. The colorful palates are designed with abnormal touches of fantasy at every turn whether it\u2019d be the games, the various landscapes, towns, and characters. Speaking of which, the characters also has credibility with physical appearances to portray them as heirs, gamers, and angels. On the other hand, fan service is explicit and never attempts to hide itself in any way or form with its distracting scenarios. At the same time, it also defiles logic with characters such as Shiro with white hair despite being 11 years old. Yet, every species has a distinctive look to create diversity as well. Hell, we even get to see Shiro wear a crown to show that she is a queen and Sora displaying his philanthropic traits by wearing a shirt with the iconic:\\n\\n\r\nI \u2665 Humans\\n\\n\r\nTechnical prowess also come with its soundtrack. Distinctively directed, each episode makes cleaver usage of its OST for tactical, emotional, and climatic scenes. Character voices are also dynamic with a figurative speech tone. The way characters speak doesn\u2019t feel dull or like a monologue but rather filled with energy. In fact, the soundtrack has doses of hyperactivity when it comes to its presenting gameplay machinations. To meet the end of its style, the OP and ED song are also decorated with attractiveness and catchy tone. One particular episode even makes fun of itself (for plotline purposes) through distorted crediting. It\u2019s needless to say but headphones are a must to get the satisfaction that you deserve.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show that deconstructs game tropes, NGNL also serves as an experimental way to deliver a fantasy adventure. The show often pokes fun at itself whether it\u2019d be cultures, rules, or just in general anything it can get its hands on. While the show doesn\u2019t escape its labyrinth of clich\u00e9s, it also finds way to parody them through clever usage of humorous executions. It\u2019s more than just mindless entertainment as NGNL delivers with energy and exclusive empowerment to appeal audiences by its concepts. The way to enjoy NGNL isn\u2019t to follow the story like it\u2019s some sort of instructional manual but rather as what it intended to be \u2013 gaming level of entertainment. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be biting your gums of logic so much, it'll bleed.",

            "content": "NEETs are usually referred to as people who take a long break from society to do whatever they please, causing others to view them as \u201clazy\u201d or envy them for having freedom. But if NEETs were born with superhuman intelligence and prove to be more noteworthy than your average student or professional, they deserve a lot more respect. \r\nMeet No Game No Life, Madhouse\u2019s new light and playful production, featuring NEETs with an objective to become God of a new world. It\u2019s understandable that NGNL is a fantasy where you can use your wildest imagination and can\u2019t possibly go wrong, but a common mistake thatfantasy anime like NGNL fail to do is abide by its principles. A fantasy still needs some sense of logic for slamming two geniuses who are capable of doing anything into its story. NGNL presents itself as a brilliant, captivating series but progresses to show little-by-little how it moves away from intelligence, proving how the protagonists are not as invincible as portrayed to be.\\n\\n\r\nBlank, a brother-sister duo named Sora and Shiro, is quite peculiar. All of their wins are accomplished by teamwork, and one brain cannot function well without the other nearby. They make their debut as a couple who\u2019s unbeatable and leaks intimidation. NGNL presents these protagonists with unexplained abilities, which makes their brilliance invalid. You learn nothing about Blank besides the fact they\u2019re undefeatable and possess genius-level intelligence. They both suffer from a social disorder that causes them to freak out when separated and gives Sora enough reason to sit outside the girls\u2019 bath to stay within a certain distance of Shiro. Besides a vague backstory of their first encounter, NGNL reveals nothing about their parents, their lives in Tokyo, or any kind of self-narration to back up their intelligence or social disorder. This results in NGNL\u2019s inability to follow through on its brilliance. Despite being undefeatable, Blank faces dead ends, admits defeat, and gets miraculously saved at the last minute. Even if there were changes in games or situations entirely, you\u2019d expect clever approaches from super intelligent protagonists besides raising the white flag. Like always, NGNL disguises such inconveniences with gag comedy references to please jaded views.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the aspects noteworthy in NGNL are the games ranging from as simple as rock-paper-scissors to majorly complex and fun like a simulation game. Blank\u2019s immediate drawbacks and impressive comebacks make it more watchable. The explanations of game plans were interesting. This makes Stephanie Dola a great add to the series, because someone has to play the simple-minded character to dumb down the complex moves and game rules for everyone else to understand. The games have their flaws though. Blank arrives into a world decided by games, ran by 10 pledges, and ruled by a little boy who only became God by default because of incompetent adults. The 10 pledges are a nice gesture to keep world order, but it is just another excuse to make Blank seem intimidating. There\u2019s a pledge that denounces cheating, giving gamers an automatic loss if caught. Most of the games consisted of someone cheating or trying to overcome a cheat. Still, this brings two conclusions. Either Blank is indeed genius, or everyone in the new world is incredibly stupid and uses cheats to hide the fact they lack wisdom and the appropriate skills to win. Blank faces every opponent with a confident attitude, expecting a 100% win. Then the show becomes predictable, because Blank is always right. None of their opponents are challenging enough to take them on. The pacing was just right, so 12 episodes was not enough to fulfill the primary objective and ends with a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the cast is female, giving Sora several chances to play the dominate male and open pervert. This makes characters appear as airheads or suffer high risks for Blank's purposes. The characters vary in personalities and abilities, and NGNL did a great job dividing their abilities based upon their race. Some had their own fetishes as well. Each of them played a role in Blank\u2019s overall objective, so each one has his or her own unique trait whether it\u2019s attractive or vice versa. Since this is a comedy, characters freely act outrageous after a serious moment in an attempt to get a laugh. It is only regarded to a certain extent, because they do not always act appropriately to certain situations, making it hard to distinguish the comedy and seriousness. Their sudden reactions to surprises are mostly hilarious, especially Blank\u2019s reaction when Stephanie says something bright for a change. Some of the characters share backstories and relationships that can possibly give viewers a different impression of them.\\n\\n\r\nNGNL takes ecchi over the top with its fanservice. Awkward clich\u00e9 scenes of falling and landing into boobs make it annoying and close to a harem. Most games consist of girls losing clothes or undergarments sometimes as an excuse for virgin Sora to get his feels. However, I disregard this a little considering that NGNL is clearly within the ecchi genre, so this is expected. I mainly mentioned it as a warning to those who despises the abuse of ecchi fanservice. The only flaw is how this makes every game predictable, because each one seems to need fanservice for strategic purposes or solutions. \\n\\n\r\nThe pastel colors are initially what makes NGNL so lively, and I applaud Madhouse for taking a different approach with unique artwork and animation. As someone who is not a big fan of ecchi, I found it to be tolerable because of the pastel colors. The settings and character design were unbelievably gorgeous, and it is greatly necessary to distinguish the vast races and their territories within the world, including the elves and warbeasts. Except NGNL seems to care more about their appeal than abiding by the law of gravity. Clearly, you cannot hold onto a floating cloth in the sky as if it\u2019s an airplane wing or Aladdin's magic carpet. Characters hang upside down and their hair doesn't follow their lead. Even if gravitational failure is not a big deal, it makes NGNL misleading considering that an arc touched on the concepts of science a great deal, including gravity.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was suitable for the game theme of NGNL, but there are music references from other games to make the OST seem unoriginal. Sometimes it was confusing. NGNL seemed to have a hard time differentiating between comedy and seriousness, and the music gives it away. Something unexpected happens, characters make a big deal out of it, and yet the music is just as cheerful as ever. The OP and ED were very good, and the lyrics fit the show\u2019s theme and Blank\u2019s relationship quite well. There are no complaints about the seiyuu either, because they all switched their tones appropriately during certain situations, especially Blank. They succeeded with the sound effects, too, and it brought out the comedy more.\\n\\n\r\nNGNL was a fun show to watch, and I looked forward to seeing a new episode every week. Impressive strategic gameplay, clever comebacks from Blank, and the beautiful animation with pastel colors are a few things that intrigued me. Despite how much I loved it, NGNL doubtlessly lacked the maturity and logic it needed to achieve the pursuit for powerful, undefeatable characters. The fantasy genre can be imaginative, as long as the show supports their ideas with some kind of explanation like NGNL failed to do. If you want to introduce super intelligent NEETs with an objective to take over the world, perfect. But to make them into something overly invincible with unexplained abilities without any backstory or presentation of evidence? That\u2019s a tough cookie to break. Since NGNL won as the hype of Spring 2014, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that there\u2019s a sequel awaiting us in the future.",

            "content": "Everywhere I go here on MAL I see people praising this show. 10s are almost the standard since this show aired. Almost impossible to escape to the hype surrounding this anime I found myself watching the first episode even though I am against fan-fiction like stories such as this one. So, what do I think of the show?\r\nWell, it has been quite a bumpy road with No Game No Life for me. A surprisingly weak start with almost every clich\u00e9 in just two or three episodes a pandering show like this could ever contain and more headshakes I ever did when watching anime since SwordArt Online were part of this experience. It got gradually more bearable though as the series reached its end to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nWell, let's take a look in what the alleged \"Anime of the Season\" has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nWhen reading the synopsis I was already shaking my head in disbelief. Yet another fan-fiction premise, yet again super cool NEETs living the life 90% of the people here would gladly kill for? I am certain it is unnecessary to tell what No Game No Life is all about since most of you guys reading this are already watching it as well.\\n\r\nLet's rather talk about the problems I had with the story. \\n\\n\r\nAlso note, so far no second season has announced. I will treat the story section of No Game No Life as if no second season is announced when coming to the ending. Yes, I know there is a light novel of the show but we are reviewing the anime here. Not the light novel!\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, No Game No Life tried to achieve so much in just a twelve episode run-time it felt rushed at times just to squeeze in as much as possible. They want to take over the whole world but how much could they possibly get my just twelve episodes? \\n\r\nI guess it may be just me but the whole set up and how it was handled is way too convenient for me to overlook it. Yes, \"Blank\" consisting of Sora and his super-intelligent-NEET-hikikomori-loli imouto providing regular panty shots Shiro are unbeatable, literally unbeatable. The story part of No Game No Life felt like watching a newcomer play Dark Souls for the first time with god mode enabled because just as Blank (I guess I figured out why the name's \"Blank\". Which makes it easier for self-insertion!), he'd be undefeatable no matter how big the challenge may look or what there is at stake. There is no sense of tension because you can predict that Blank will win no matter what. All you do is wait for the resolution on how they did it which is unpredictable because the main characters are alleged geniuses which - for me - was nowhere near this fascinating. Not saying this is all bad, it really is entertaining and gets you by surprise being exposed to their kind of play for the first few times, but most of the explanations just felt like Deus Ex Machina which again could be excused by them being geniuses.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of world building No Game No Life did an average at best job as well. Yes, humanity is now called \"Imanity\" and is on the bottom of the food chain amongst other beings inhabiting this world. But yet again this is hardly explained in detail to make me personally attached at all. Also the other species are as original as it gets with your average elf-like beings using their magic, the war beasts having super-human speed and agility, there is no originality to be found here either. \\n\\n\r\nThe games they play are also not seemingly flawless and even contain plot holes in how they were executed by the show, for example the game of Shiratori in episode 6 where every player  had 30 seconds to make their next move. Because Blank is so perfect though it just takes them almost a whole minute just for one. How things like those get past a quality check seems incomprehensible to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe general pacing was also one of the things which bugged me. Most of the time there just wasn't anything meaningful going on and time got wasted for nonsensical reference humor or blatant fan service which is a thing I highly dislike in anime.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the visuals No Game No Life scored way better at me. I like it when studios try out new stuff and come out as daring especially at something crucial as the visuals. No Game No Life kept an overall decent standard of quality and used an interesting if even maybe unusual and surreal art style as well as fluid animation. To be honest watching the first few episodes it seemed way too surreal and almost unpleasing for me personally. As the time went by though I found myself getting attached to it as it fitted the show\u2019s theme quite well. As said, credit where credit is due, the makers dared to stand out from the norm and delivered a more than solid job in my eyes even if I ended up hating how they made Shiro and her facial expressions with her tiny mouth. This surely is just me but I couldn't stand some of the character designs at all.\\n\\n\r\nComing to the acoustic performance of No Game No Life I just have positive things to say. Starting with a strong and catchy opening theme the series never failed to convey a certain feeling of tension during moments when Blank once again had triumphed over their mentally inferior enemies. The soundtrack is literally what kept me hoping for more to come, being composed very well and used even better in the right scenes. If I had one thing to complain about the soundtrack it would be that some of songs got used to often and lacked in overall variety. Considering their quality this is a thing I am willing to forgive.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also top-notch and leaves barely room to complain, except the characters which they voice acted.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are actually my biggest complaint alongside the not really original and sometimes even rigged by plot holes part that is the story. Blank may be perfect but this is just the thing which won't sell me for No Game No Life. They are too perfect, every of their moves in unpredictable it almost comes off as a downright ass pull - speaking only of the main characters Sora and Shiro though. The rest of the cast is entirely female and besides one tear-jerking moment of Stephanie it gets completely downgraded to pure fan service which is a shame because since later on they threw some other races into the bunch as well which could have been used for great character and world building but was cut to the most essential things and once again fan service because since the \"Flugel\" is a flying race they have their erogenous zones on their wings. Ha-ha, so clever. Not. And of course every female which gets to meet a smelly and skinny NEET is most likely to want to explore his erogenous zones. Totally what would happen in real life! And besides the main cast there were barely important characters which could be used even if only as plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the problems I had with the show, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy No Game No Life the slightest bit. The atmosphere was right during the moments it should have been to grab my attention even when just for a little moment longer than it managed before. The conclusions weren't always the most logical or the most likely ones but satisfying nevertheless if you take the show what it's supposed to be; an entertaining pseudo-intelligent comedy. Regarding the comedy No Game No Life consists of solely two parts of comedic \"attempts\". One would be referential humor and the other being fan service. What I personally missed where clever jokes and not just some sexual slurs or innuendos alongside some deadbeat jokes. The most entertaining parts for me where not the ones others would consider to be funny but for how Blank would manage to achieve the next goal. Not if they would but how - because Blank can't lose.\\n\\n\r\nSumming this up No Game No Life was a decent entry of the wish-fulfillment-genre which must include beautiful women, a super cool and flawless main character, games, video-games, a world to escape to. It stood out using a rather unique art style and underlining it with a very good soundtrack but lacked in story and characterization. Too much time was wasted on fan service which could have been used on actual development of the over sexualized almost all-female cast. While I didn't expect much after reading the synopsis I wouldn't even say I got disappointed but the hype surrounding it seems similar to the one Sword Art Online experienced back in the day. Unlike Sword Art Online No Game No Life is self-aware most of the time and at least does not take itself seriously to a level where it comes off as forced drama. It knows what it wants to be and pulls that off quite nicely and confident, ending up being entertaining but nothing of outstanding quality.\\n\\n",

            "content": "No Game No Life, the anime everyone was talking about this season. Everywhere on MAL and the anime subreddit everyone was praising NGNL. I tried hard to like it but I just couldn't, there was almost nothing redeemable about this show. If the show is bad then why do people watch it? And how did it get so popular? Well I guess I'll try my best to describe, while not spoiling as much as I can. \r\nFirst off I'll start by listing all of the positives about this show, the art and animation was beautiful, nothing less to be expected by MadHouse. The OST wasgreat music at the wrong times, so I'm not sure if I could count that as a positive, but the OST in general is above average. And a colorful and beautiful World with endless opportunities for creativity. \\n\\n\r\nSo the plot is about two NEETs who are brother and sister, win at any game with 0% chance of losing. Why did the author end up making the protagonists NEETS? Well because he wanted to make most of the community who watch anime feel good about themselves. You could pretty much describe every character in one word and know everything about them, for example Sora is a beautiful virgin NEET who is somehow a genius who wins any game possible that's set in front of him. Shiro, who is Sora's sister, does literally next to nothing in the show except act as fanservice for lolicons. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are sadly even more one dimensional if that is even possible. So why does Sora have 3000 favorites then? Well just like Lelouche from Code Geass, or Light from Death Note, Sora is incredibly over powered and every other character in the series is retarded compared to him, we could  say he is the big fish in the extremely small pool. Actually we could say he is the big fish in the small fish tank all by himself since all the other characters are non existent compared to him. \\n\\n\r\nEarlier I mentioned Sora was over powered and that he wins any game 100% of the time, in the series he even says he wins games before they are even played. So in this new magical land that they are brought to, there is no wars, any dispute is solved over games. Games decide everything, even who owns which land. So the games could have been really interesting but you could tell from the beginning, no matter what Sora would win any game so there wasn't much to care about. Although I will admit some of the games mechanics were pretty interesting and MadHouse did an amazing job animating them. \\n\\n\r\nWhenever Sora won a game, the episode would end and we would get 2 or 3 episodes of SoL + fan service shoved down our throats. As someone who loves SoL, a genre that relies 100% on how good their characters are. Well the characters in NGNL are honestly the worst cast I have seen yet, The SoL elements were so horrible that they had to rely on ecchi and fanservice. Hell actually half of the side characters in Sora's harem were only made for fan service, for example an angel who acted as nothing but a slave. She turned a complete 180 from being an angel who had no respect for humans to a slave who is completely loyal in a matter of minutes. \\n\\n\r\nNear the last couple of episodes you could tell that they were running out of ideas and it just started to feel stale. Also the ending was very dissatisfying and didn't come near to bringing the season to a close. I enjoyed watching the show a bit, but that was mostly because MadHouse did such a good job with the art and animation.",

            "content": "Blank can unite this burning land and bring an end to all this Disboard!! (haha puns, Disboard, discord.)\r\n-Overall\r\nNo Game No Life is about 2 NEETs, Sora and Shiro, who are geniuses when it comes to games. They are transported to a world where games decide everything from national borders to theft. Because Sora and Shiro are amazing at games, this world, called Disboard, (haha discord, this board, disboard, hahahaha games haha) seems like their dream world. The art reflects this, with it's unique coloration and artstyle.\r\nThe voices are very well done, and the soundtrack is very fitting. The characters each have comedic elements associated withthem, so depending on the current interactions of characters, different jokes and comedy scenes can be made. This helps freshen up the comedy and keep it new. This show was my favorite this season, and the comedy and bad*ssery that Sora and Shiro did make me hope for a season 2. Personally, I think a season 2 is likely because the anime is receiving so much praise and recognition, and the light novel that the anime is based off of is progressing quickly. \\n\r\nStory: 8.25\\n\r\nArt: 9.95\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.15\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9.27. It's great. \\n\r\nMore details down below.\\n\\n\r\n-Story:\\n\r\nThe story of No Game No Life is well built. First off, the premise is well explained. There is a world where 10 pledges govern sentient beings, and games decide everything. Why this is is explained early on and the pledges are constantly stated to make sure the audience understands the setting. The story is entertaining and progresses quite naturally. Sora and Shiro must take small steps before they take the large ones, and that is reflected in the 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\n-Art\\n\r\nThe art for No Game No Life is amazing. It's unique art style helps create a dreamy atmosphere, reflecting on the fact that Disboard really is Sora and Shiro's dream world. It always looks fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\nThe voices are very well done, and sound very genuine. The music is very good as well, and goes well with the scenes.\\n\\n\r\n-Character\\n\r\nThe characters are lovable. Sora and Shiro are geniuses, and everyone likes geniuses. But they aren't incredibly intellectual, which most of us aren't, making them relatable. Sora is smart, but aside from when he's \"being smart,\" he acts like a (for the most part) like a normal person. Same with Shiro. All the characters provide a comedic aspect unique to that character in the series, and depending on which characters currently have the spotlight, different jokes are made, spicing up the comedy quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\nThis is probably my favorite anime this season, and I always looked forward to watching this show. I'm sad too see it go, but excited for next season.",

            "content": "A lot of popular shows have plenty of problems that are often ignored because they pander to their intended audience and NGNL (No Game, No Life) is no exception. The impressions one would likely get from the hype surrounding NGNL are it\u2019s \u201can amazing show with an original premise and spectacular story-telling.\u201d Though this is mostly exaggeration, as this show is far from amazing, it\u2019s also far from awful for plenty of good reasons. NGNL\u2019s glory stems from how well it knows its audience and that is a point in its favor, but there are definitely issues with it that should be addressed.\r\nIt\u2019s easy toargue that a show with good characters is a good show and NGNL has this aspect covered, whether the former is true or not. A very serious person might laugh at that statement, but that laughter is coming from the ignorance of the characters\u2019 purpose. Each of the characters do their apparent job well and that is to be distinct and interesting as well as appeal to the target audience. The excellence of the cast is thanks to the way the NGNL allows it\u2019s intended audience to relate to it\u2019s main characters and that is a sign of competence from the creators (or that they are lucky).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, though the characters are a high point of NGNL for being interesting, and in a way fun, it\u2019s hard to deny their flaws. For one, our two main characters, the siblings Sora and Shiro, are nearly perfect (ironically, considering I\u2019m saying this is a flaw), and it sucks a lot of the anxiety you might have, and even some of the fun, out of the show. They do seem to be self-aware, but it hardly excuses this problem. In fact, their aptitude in nearly everything is ridiculous considering their circumstances. It\u2019s clear that this probably only to give them \u201ccool points\u201d and cheat its main audience into thinking the characters are well designed (I use cheat loosely). All this is only compounded by how the other prominent members of NGNL\u2019s cast of characters, such as Steph and Jibril, only help boost Sora and Shiro\u2019s ego as they seem to only compliment their incredible skill, both indirectly and directly. Also, it\u2019s unbecoming for the cast that most of the characters are there solely for \u201cfanservice\u201d and other appeal. As such, even though this anime\u2019s characters are \u201cfun and cool\u201d, they aren\u2019t nearly realistic and have exaggerated abilities (and personalities too).\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said about the overall above average cast, it\u2019s unfortunate the premise isn\u2019t as original as plenty claim because similar stories have definitely been conceived and written. That isn\u2019t foretelling of an uninspired plot though, is it? The answer to that question is subjective, but it doesn\u2019t matter that much. The story almost entirely focuses on the siblings, brother and sister, Sora and Shiro as they are brought to an alternate world after beating the god of said world in a game. In this world, everything is decided by games (not violence, debate, etc.) so you\u2019d think this would allow for some creativity involving all the games they will likely be playing. Unfortunately, whoever authored NGNL seemingly always uses a likeness to a Deus Ex Machina as the solution for the siblings inevitably winning the games they play. The way the games are played are less intelligent than they are presented. To be honest, for a show about games, the games aren\u2019t exciting at all because you know the outcome is always that the siblings will win. Also, the story itself isn\u2019t very interesting anyway, as the things that mostly happen are playing games and cracking jokes so NGNL heavily relies on \u201cfanservice\u201d and references which isn\u2019t a strong foothold. It\u2019s good the forced drama is rare though.\\n\\n\r\nThis might put NGNL down a bit, but beneath the unpolished story is a nice setting that is not fully explored. Because Sora and Shiro decide to try defeating and uniting the intelligent races in the new world they arrive in, we get to explore many of the interesting places that said world contains. NGNL doesn\u2019t feed us with a lot of adventure and exploration though, so this could be a missed opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the setting very nicely designed, the animation compliments it too. The animation quality is not top-notch, but it is unique. It\u2019s nice to see something different as the art uses some uncommon colors and has a nice hue of orange.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the voice acting is good as the voice actors do their jobs well. There aren\u2019t any performances of immediate note though. Also, the music is fine, but there is better out there\\n\\n\r\nOverall, even though NGNL will likely leave a positive impression on you, its also good to consider its undeniable flaws. It\u2019s something you\u2019ll definitely like if you land in its target audience range. That means you like random fanservice and the predictable outcome of the games. If you don\u2019t like it, you\u2019ll probably find this anime poor for trying to act smart and tripping like a fool. While NGNL may have an uninteresting premise, its characters and setting make up for a good portion of it. And though it\u2019s not as good as some may claim it to be, it\u2019s an exaggeration to say it\u2019s bad. NGNL is a fun experience, but it\u2019s not all it\u2019s praised to be and not a must watch. You may want to watch it for that orange hue though.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n",

            "content": "Fiction exists as a distraction. There exists many kinds of fiction: comedy, adventure, drama, etc. And then there's shallow wish fulfillment shlock that only exists for the purpose of pandering. Thus, No Game No Life exists.\r\nNo Game No Life is the \"story\" of two NEET siblings, Sora (18 years old) and Shiro (11 years old) who form a team known as \"Blank\". One day, they get sucked into another world called Disboard, wherein every conflict is resolved through games, including political affairs. Thus, when Stephanie, the princess of Elchea, loses her inheritance to the throne after losing a game of poker, Sora and Shiro decideto compete in order to claim the throne for themselves, and eventually conquer Disboard.\\n\\n\r\nYou know all those bad fanfics that are Mary Sue wish fulfillment stories, wherein the main character is a loser in this world, and then they go to another world like Hyrule, or Star Trek, or Middle-Earth, or Equestria, or Idontgiveashitland and turns out to be a total badass who wins at everything and never loses at anything? That's what No Game No Life is like. Every single time Sora and Shiro play a game, they always win, even if it's a game which is based purely on luck.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, from other shows in this genre, like Death Note or Code Geass, or even Kaiji, we already know that the main character is going to succeed with their mind games, and the fun in that is seeing how the main character wins. But at least in those shows, there is actual dramatic tension. They actually have moments where we think the characters are going to lose, and even if they don't, their actions still have consequences. Even if they win, they lose something in doing so. In NGNL, there is little to no dramatic tension at any point. Even if the audience is reminded of how high the stakes are in the games they play, we already know that the characters are invincible from the get-go and will never have to cut their losses, the only reason for that being Sora and Shiro's catchphrase \"Blank never loses.\" This makes the show completely and utterly boring to watch, because why should I care about whether the characters win or lose if there is no tension because they never lose? Late in the show, they bet the lives of everyone in Elchea, and at that point their victory is a foregone conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters: Sora is your typical cocky-as-fuck and smug-as-shit lead character. Shiro is the generic borderline-emotionless younger sister character with white hair and wants Sora's dick. Stephanie is the retarded-more-often-than-not love interest who is the former princess and wants Sora's dick. Jibril is the kooky yet knowledgeable one, who wants Sora's dick. Do any of those characters sound familiar? If so, that's because they're the exact same fucking characters that you would find in this type of anime. The only difference is that they have little-to-no positive or admirable traits about them to balance out.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5 in particular is a good example of this, consisting of Steph continuously challenging Sora and Shiro and predictably losing. Not only do our heroes make her walk around wearing dog ears and a tail and make her remove her clothes every time she loses out of spite for her having a better social life (and Shiro out of jealousy because Sora made Steph fall in love with him due to the pledges), but Steph is retarded enough to keep challenging them, even though she keeps losing. This makes the show further frustrating to watch, because the characters are so unlikable that I don't want them to win, making episode 9, wherein Sora disappears and Shiro has to find a way to bring him back, the only time where there is actual dramatic tension, unemotional. Why should I be sad about a character disappearing and excited about him reappearing if he is a jackass?\\n\\n\r\nIt also brings me to my next point: the fanservice. I don't mind fanservice that much if it's in small doses, but this show goes way overboard! Disregarding the aforementioned episode 5, the very first shot of Shiro is a panty-shot (keep in mind, she's 11). Every time the characters are falling, or flying around, there's panty-shots. Several times throughout the show, the characters go to the onsen, giving us yet more tasteful fanservice involving a shampoo bottle which sprouts tentacles. The final game in the anime depicts a video game where they have to hunt their opponent across a large city while avoiding enemy catgirls, and of course they use their guns to shoot off their clothes. Not to mention the OVAs, the third one consists of Steph getting tentacle-raped, and I am not even joking. I know this is an ecchi, but even other ecchi shows I've seen don't shove the fanservice in your face as much as this.\\n\\n\r\nEven the excuse I've seen some people make for the fanservice being sarcastic doesn't cover this, the fanservice has about as much purpose here as in post-timeskip Fairy Tail. They say that it's meant to be satirical, to make fun of all the other shows in this genre for having pointless fanservice. So it makes fun of pointless fanservice by having pointless fanservice? That would be like if I made fun of terrorists by blowing up a building: it defeats its own purpose.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the animation, it looks pretty at times, and the show is very colorful. However, it is also too colorful, the color palette is oversaturated with pink, and the show in general uses colors so bright that it causes eyestrain. If you watched this show in the middle of the night with all the lights turned off, you'd probably have a seizure.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think that No Game No Life fails at practically every aspect. There's no problem with a show that doesn't take itself seriously, but there's a difference between that and being so retarded that it becomes a chore to watch. I'd rather watch a bad show that takes itself seriously and ends up being boring than a show that doesn't take itself seriously but fails because of its unfunny humor. Having torticollis was more fun than watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't have a problem or even like any of these aspects, then go ahead and watch it and you'll probably like it. If you're anything like me though, you most likely won't like it. I mean, I watch anime and play video games, but even I can see what masturbatory nonsense this is.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is practically indistinguishable from a crappy self-insert wish fulfillment fanfic, so much so that it would make Dakari King Mykan blush. This could have been an okay show if the characters were actually likable, if there was actual dramatic tension and if there wasn't so much goddamn fanservice. As it is, though, this is the worst anime I've seen in a long-ass time.",

            "content": "Do you ever just have those series that you really want to love, but just can't for various reasons?\r\nWell, No Game No Life, or NGNL for short, is that anime for me.\r\nThe premise starts out interestingly enough, with two genius gamer, hikko-NEET siblings who find themselves transported to an alternate fantasy world where everything is decided by games. There, they are caught up in humanity's struggle for survival, which is mostly based on politics and the relative strengths of the other races, since in the alternate world there is no war or killing. Since Sora and Shiro are already incredibly skilled at games due totheir talents in logical thinking and strategy, they have no trouble playing their way towards being the new rulers of Elkia, the human kingdom, and subsequently challenging the other races with the ultimate goal to defeat Tet, the god of the game world. \\n\\n\r\nI'll admit, with the hype surrounding NGNL along with the bright and colorful poster art, I was really excited for this show. I really love genius characters in anime, and having two of them as protagonists seemed almost too good to be true. Unfortunately, Sora and Shiro didn't quite live up to my expectations. While they both turned out to be Gary Stu/Mary Sue-type characters, the biggest problem was NGNL actually takes itself, and by extension its characters, pretty seriously. Sure, there are numerous comedic moments in the show, but those were always brushed aside whenever the real plot kicked in, making the tone rather inconsistent and the characters wholly unbelievable. Plus, the quasi-incest relationship between Sora and Shiro was uncomfortable at best, and icky at worst. I have no moral issues with the subject of incest itself, but too often in anime and manga it's played off as a joke and for fanservice rather than handled well. But then again, I don't really know if there would have been a better way to portray the siblings' relationship, as NGNL constantly fluctuates from being entirely serious to silly and fanservice-laden.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself felt rather contrived, as it needlessly forces the \"logic\" behind the games down its viewers' throats one minute and has the main duo peeking at another character's panties the next. I don't mind fanservice occasionally, but NGNL's fanservice was neither tasteful nor funny. Sora's attempts at winning the trust of the female characters is usually just thinly-veiled sexual harassment. I know that's kind of the point, but I just didn't find it entertaining. Also, NGNL likes to trick its viewers into thinking that Sora and Shiro winning game after game is the product of intelligence and logic, when in reality most of the explanations they come up with are completely ridiculous and unrealistic. This would be fine if the show was trying to parody the whole \"ALL ACCORDING TO PLAN\" thing a lot of anime incorporate, except for the fact that NGNL also takes this very seriously, as if everything happening is totally plausible. And in my opinion, the contrast between the fanservice-heavy comedy parts and the relatively serious game/politics parts just doesn't really work too well.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few redeeming factors of NGNL is its art style, which is quirky, vivid, and all around nice to look at. The animation and music weren't always top-notch, but at least the bright colors and cute character designs made me ignore some of those faults. The art was definitely also unique, as I haven't seen many anime series with that particular use of lighting and color palette.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that being said, I do have to admit that No Game No Life was fun at times. That is, it's the kind of dumb fun that you would enjoy at 2 AM with your brain turned off. And okay, Shiro was pretty cute. But that doesn't change my overall opinion of the series. I don't hate NGNL, but after reading a lot of other reviews and people's opinions on this show (not to mention the current MAL ratings for this show, holy shit) I just couldn't understand why it's so popular and highly regarded. Maybe for some people the idea of a world where everyone plays games to solve problems is their idea of paradise, or maybe the way the main characters defy logic and reason with their wins really gets people's blood pumping. I really don't know. But as for myself, I can only say that although I had some fun with No Game No Life at some points throughout its 12-episode run, it was ultimately not my cup of tea and had many flaws that detracted from what first seemed like an interesting concept.\\n\\n\r\n[Note:] This review was originally written on my blog, and is technically rated a 6.5/10. I'm pretty generous when it comes to ratings, though.",

            "content": "\"Give people bright colors and fan service and they go crazy and lose any logic\"\r\nNo game No Life is a curious anime to me. I Consider myself to be a not so cruel scorer always giving anime a chance and always looking for positives but this is not the case for No Game No Life with me. Considered to be the next best thing since canned bread everybody seems to love this and I'm the only one who cant see what is so good about it. I will try to give my vision on the show in the next couple of sections so please barewith me.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story without giving away too much its about 2 overly intelligent pair of step brothers Sora and Shiro  who are portrayed as neets. They are bored with normal life and just love to play videogames. One day they get the opportunity to join a game world where 16 races rule. In the game world extreme and weird games exist with rules varying per agreement of the players so everything is at stake. All seems peaches and cream for an interesting anime with some good story movement except that the story progression is really slow.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up its really nice neon colors. Very fluid and detailed animation especially the background. I have to say that despite not enjoying the anime this is its strongest asset and its really pleasing to the eye. Madhouse really did a good job with the art and I think its top 2 of the season along with Bokura Wa mina Kawaisou. \\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\r\nI don't think it was over the top or memorable that you want to buy the OST's or anything. Nothing really negative else to say by my part except that it was solid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (Only will be covering 3)\\n\\n\r\na) Sora - Main character, 18 year old neet who lives with his loli stepsister Shiro. Overly intelligent and with many sexual needs (according to the show). Sora quickly became an apparent icon this season for best character this season and all I can say is why? One of Sora's biggest strengths is also his downfall as a character and this is his super intelligence. Nothing is ever a challenge in this supposed challenging game world to him and he always seems to have a plan for everything. He tries to be too cool for my liking. I never found any of his jokes or references to be funny or entertaining only just kinda corny.\\n\\n\r\nb) Shiro - The other main character, 11 year old step sister of Sora. More intelligent than Sora apparently and has a brother complex. With Shiro its another case of overuse of Lolis for roles that can be fulfilled with normal characters along with Black Bullet. I don't get the semi naked scenes of Shiro which in this case is a minor throughout the show and it feels a bit disturbing. Shiro's downfall as a character to me is that she is just there to pull Sora back together and do some crazy deus ex machima to pull him out of the rare stuff that he cant (going according to plan if we follow the show's logic) do. \\n\\n\r\nc) Stephanie Dola - The other main character who's purpose is nothing but be exposed half naked every 4 minutes and be mocked off because of her stupidity. I have gotten slander here on MAL because apparently her role is much deeper in motivating Sora and what not if you go all philosophical with the fan boys. In reality its not and her contribution to the progression of the plot is about 0. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nWhere is the enjoyment supposed to come from this show? If its the games it did a poor job. You never get the sensation that the games are a challenge for any of the main characters because everything goes according to plan and they are never really under any concern due to Sora and Shiro's super Einstein like intellect. There is always something that saves them from defeat or something which gets really annoying by episode 3 or 4. \\n\\n\r\nLet me say that chess game in episode the span of episodes 4-5? (I maybe wrong) Is probably the worst thing you can ever watch since there is absolutely no logic behind it all and its just a complete out of thin air invention to win the game. The only game I really enjoyed where the last 2 episodes because the main characters where actually in a pinch it goes in the most predictable way of having the most useless character in the show do something. It all went according to the same generic running theme throughout the show that everything is going according to the super master plan that we won the game before we even start. How do people get any joy out of this is beyond me. \\n\\n\r\nThe core of the plot is really slow and its pretty much overshadowed by the fan service and stupidity of Stephanie who is pretty much just a guinea pig to try out stuff throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nIn the end I was really disappointed since I was looking forward to the show and all I got was just a slap in the face of how overrated, flawed and boring this show is some weeks in. The fan service outshines the plot and that is already a red flag. The plot already weak to begin with and all you get is boobs and stupidity with slow progression its not really ideal.",

Originally a light novel written by Kamiya Yuu, No Game No Life (or NGNL for short) is a series not quite like any other, mixing together numerous ordinary concepts into a not-so-ordinary and very refreshing story. It is not just about originality though, but the provided execution is absolutely fantastic as well, as this is one of the most addictive and over-the-top anime you'll ever come across.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Story--\\n\r\nHow can anything seemingly so dumb be so damn smart?\\n\\n\r\nIn recent years there has been a fair share of anime following the concept of \"being trapped inside a video game with no way to escape it\", and it has been very successful. No Game No Life however takes the exact same idea and flips it upside down. This story is not about being trapped inside a game world, but rather instead it's about voluntarily being in a fantasy world which has its very foundation oriented around the concept of games. The only other anime I can think of that uses a somewhat similar idea is Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo, but NGNL takes it one or two steps further, and more importantly does it around nine or ten levels better.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a legendary player team in the online gaming community named \"[ ]\" (pronounced \"K\u016bhaku\", or \"Blank\" in English) which was known for never ever losing to anyone, no matter which game they were playing. Their real-life identities however were unknown to the world, but as it turned out it consisted of a pair of NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) gamer siblings: 18 year old Sora and his 11 year old little sister Shiro. These two geniuses were completely fed up with the real world and didn't think of it as anything more than a shitty game, and therefore spent all their time in their room owning others in online games. That is to say before they got challenged online by a mysterious chess player who brought them to the very limits of their abilities before they could eventually manage to win. As a result, they got contacted by someone named Tet; the God of another world called Disboard, the ultimate paradise for gamers of Sora's and Shiro's caliber and he therefore invited them to come live in his world instead. And thus, the games began.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of Disboard, there are a total of sixteen different races that have been granted the protection of the Ten Commandments, and are therefore the only ones worth mentioning. These races are seeded in order of magical strength, and at the very bottom of the ranking we find the race of Imanity, which is Disboard's equivalent to the human race (clearly a spinoff of the word \"humanity\"). However as shameful as being at the bottom of the food chain might be, that ranking was made before Sora and Shiro arrived as reinforcements.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the story of No Game No Life is about the siblings' long-term plans of conquering the world by challenging others at games and using the Ten Commandments' wagers as winnings while (hopefully) maintaining [ ]'s 100% win record. Sounds simple enough, right? Well it's not.\\n\\n\r\nThe catch is that since the Ten Commandments make up the very structure of the world itself, combined with the fact that it's a supernatural world containing magic to begin with; what the games are, how they are played and what their consequences are is *completely* limitless. This anime can and will do anything and everything as long as the author can think it up in his head beforehand, and let me tell you: what he has managed to cook up is nothing short of spectacular. Seriously, the amount of creativity and pure awesomeness poured into the various game sessions throughout this anime should most definitely *not* be understated, and as a result NGNL has some of the best single individual episodes I've ever seen in my anime career.\\n\\n\r\nOf course that is not to say the grander, overarching story is any less impressive. Actually it manages to maintain the individual episode quality while still staying on track for the long-term plot in a very smooth manner of fashion, and as a result the anime never ever gets boring. It has a very high \"lowest level\u201d so to speak, but it does still get a bit spiky as some episodes are a lot better than others, however that is a jump ranging from \"good\" to \"amazing\" rather than ever dipping down very much. You'll constantly be starved for more.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nWhoever would have thought NEETs would be so neat?\\n\\n\r\nAs the 2-man protagonist team of the series, undoubtedly the vast majority of the focus in the character department is on Sora and Shiro themselves, and they're certainly not disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSora is extremely charismatic and cunning. He uses tons of deceitful tactics and strategies planned out way in advance in order to direct the flow of events much more so than meets the eye at first glance. As he likes to say, no matter how the game turns out, his victory is already assured from the very beginning. Of course this does not mean he's the second coming of Light or Lelouch, as Sora has no sinister ulterior motives (other than perverted ones every so often) and instead is really a very humorous and enthusiastic person that just likes to have fun.\\n\\n\r\nShiro on the other hand looks like nothing more than a moe fanservice loli at first glance, and to some extent I cannot say that part is wrong per se. In case you didn't realize it this is an ecchi anime in the end. We're talking about very light ecchi here and nothing that ever feels forced but rather used for comedy instead, however you still shouldn't be shocked if you find some nudity and boob groping every once in a while. Now as far as Shiro herself is concerned, that does however not change the fact that there is a hell of a lot more to her than that. For one she's quite fun to listen to with her almost completely expressionless voice, yet very blunt choice of words. Also, in reality her level of genius is way above that one of her brother, but in a very different way. Shiro's mind works sort of like a supercomputer, capable of unmatched amounts of logical thinking and data storage at any given point. On the other hand this makes her less adaptable than Sora, however what this means is that the pair of them perfectly complement each other's weaknesses. Thus even if they might be defeatable on their own, when they play together they are almost invulnerable, hence why [ ] is always together as one... actually whenever they are out of each other's line of sight they start panicking and get seizures and god knows what else.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast primarily consists of Stephanie Dola (or Dora, either works) whom at first also looks like the obligatory fanservice character but before long you'll realize that she's much more of a comic relief character... or rather the butt of everyone else's jokes. Now normally I might be a bit skeptical to that idea but this girl fills that role absolutely *perfectly*. Huge props to her voice actress I also have to add, she really did an awesome job expressing Stephanie's impulsive behaviour. There is also the ever so popular Jibril who is just all around awesome in every way, but I'll avoid talking about her as she is introduced later on in the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Art--\\n\r\nNo you're not on drugs, it actually looks like that\\n\\n\r\nThe word \"colorful\" doesn't even begin to scratch the surface on this one. Animated by Madhouse, NGNL probably has the most vivid color scheme I've yet to come across in an anime and it is hard to put into words just what exactly it looks like. It has tons of purple and red everywhere and tends to use colors even for distinguishing details like shadows, outlines and similar. It's really the kind of thing you need to see for yourself to understand but it sure as hell stands out from the crowd.\\n\\n\r\nAs always when it comes to artwork, it is entirely a subjective matter and whether you like it or not is up to every viewer individually. Personally I really liked it though, it somehow fit the over-the-top environments and atmosphere of the series very well, but I would still have to say that had it been for any other anime it would probably just have come off as being really weird.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\r\nCan you feel that beat? Beating everyone at everything that is\\n\\n\r\nOn its own this was definitely the part which I thought about the least while I was actually watching the series, but when looking at it in retroperspective it's actually really solid.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing, the OP of NGNL never particularly blew me away but to be fair I mostly ended up skipping it all the time because I was so eager to get into the new episode every week so I could never really pay too much attention to it. The ED is better albeit still not amazing, although when the full version came out I found it a lot more enjoyable than I did during the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nThat part asides though, the OST for the anime itself is one or two levels above that. Especially the music playing during some of the games themselves as well as the occasional epic speeches that occurs every once in a while during this anime have some very epic background tracks along with them.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting goes, many people will recognize the main seiyuu combi of Matsuoka Yoshitsugu and Kayano Ai making up Sora's and Shiro's respective roles. The first thing I noticed with this was that this is the exact same MC seiyuu coupling as that one of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, and just like Shiina in said anime, Shiro's voice is insanely husky and is almost like a whisper most of the time... in an adorable way of course. As far as Sora goes, more people will probably familiarize him with the fact that he has the same voice actor as Kirito from Sword Art Online, which might give some people the impression that NGNL is yet another anime which goes down the same route SAO did... which is definitely not the case.\\n\\n\r\nThey both make an absolutely solid performance in this case anyway, however to me the best voice acting in No Game No Life is the one done by Hikasa Yoko in her role as Stephanie. The role she has as the character constantly getting abused by the two siblings simply for their enjoyment (combined with the tsukkomi character she has to play for whenever their inner NEETs surface) results in her having numerous different comedy roles at the same time, yet Yoko absolutely nails them all every single time in an absolutely hilarious fashion.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment--\\n\r\n12x23 minutes never felt so short\\n\\n\r\nI'm just going to straight-up say that this is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable anime I've seen to date. Normally I don't like to watch series while they're currently airing very much, however I did it with this one and let me tell you waiting a full week for every new episode of this anime was painful. Excruciatingly so. This is not due to aspects such as constant cliffhangers or anything (although that also happens a few times) but simply due to how much fun every single episode is to watch. The concept of the anime as a whole is extremely appealing and interesting to follow, and due to the unlimited potential of the games themselves, every episode is completely different from the last one despite following the same ideals.\\n\\n\r\nThere's just so much charisma poured into the characters' over-the-top settings and it never fails to keep you hooked. Every single character is likable yet drastically different from one another. On top of all that the actual comedy part of NGNL is brilliant as well, including countless references to other anime series. I'm not sure exactly how it manages but somehow no matter which side of the show is present at any given moment, it delivers flawlessly every single time.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\r\nSo why aren't there any games like this in real life?\\n\\n\r\nEver since I first read the synopsis of this anime several months before it started airing, I immediately thought to myself: \"Hey, this sounds pretty awesome, wincest plus video games?\". Now as it turned out there wasn't very much in the way of wincest as this is solely sibling love, however what we got instead simply blew away pretty much all expectations I ever had. I did have a feeling that it would be something I would really like, but I don't think anyone who hadn't read the light novels ever imagined it to turn out this damn awesome.\\n\\n\r\nI love pretty much everything about this show, and that's not something I can say very often. From start to finish I don't think there was a single moment which I didn't enjoy, and that is something almost unheard of in anime. It's so versatile in the way that it's funny, original, charismatic, intelligent and just plain epic and awesome, all working in tandem. As a result, everything ends up being immensely satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nNow this first season covers up to the end of volume three of the original light novels, and at the current time (the anime just finished airing), there are six volumes released in Japan, so there's already plenty of content to adapt and hopefully season two won't be too far around the corner, although as always it will come down to sales numbers in the end.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, it sure as hell needs a second season sooner rather than later, as we're all going to suffer from abstinence until then.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGame Over..... for now at least........ hopefully",

            "content": "[contains spoilers]\r\nMake no mistake, No Game No Life is built to be a blockbuster. Madhouse adapting \"one of those\" wildly successful isekai light novel series made sense considering their generally poor commercial performance as of late. And NGNL, a blitzkrieg of dastardly clever action and outrageous gags, as unsettling as it is original, certain delivers a worthy blockbuster, but not without significant shortcomings.\r\nThe anime centers around the Blank siblings - Sora and Shiro: brother and sister, two shut-in NEETs on Earth, but certain victors in a new absurdist world, whose ambitions and exploits, leave their adversaries confounded and awed at the same damn time. Ostensibly,the pair could be written off as a simple gary stu/mary sue pairing. By technicality they are, but they\u2019re far from boring or cliche characters like many that fit that designation due to how the series presents their NEET qualities. Both brother and sister come off as legitimately fun leads, with flashy traits that resemble iconic characters from other well-known anime, novels, or games without feeling like standard self-inserts. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, our pair of gaming prodigies are whisked into a new isekai world, Disboard, by its enigmatic God, Tet and by the fourth, they are the rulers of Elkia, the last kingdom of Imanity, the human race. NGNL hits the ground running and doesn\u2019t let up for a second. The worldbuilding and plot development resembles the progression of an RPG: minor games precede major ones with interludes in between. Nearly the entirely of the seasons\u2019 276 minute runtime can be neatly categorized into plotting, games, or \"breaks in action\" - which generally involve harassing Steph or all the females taking baths while Sora sits back on the partition as hilarity ensues. This oversexualization and fanservice is responsible for some of the funniest moments of the season and serves to enhance the over-the-top, volatile energy of the show. \\n\\n\r\nNGNL\u2019s framework makes it easy to overstate the otaku and gamer escapism and gratification, which itself is offputting for those who have anathema to the common isekai mainstays of \"wish fulfillment\" and \"fanservice\" while indiscriminately associating these to inherently tasteless anime without a second thought. This line of logic downplays not only downplays the consistent insanity of the action, but also the nuance of the overarching premise behind the parodical, ludicrous nature of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a certain poetic justice captured by NGNL in its portrayal of how NEETs and hikikomori, who Japanese society would deem outcasts or losers regardless of their gaming talent, become monarchs, harem ringleaders, and ultimately winners. Much of NGNL\u2019s charm is more readily appreciated by seasoned otaku, who embrace, and even long for, the taboos that could potentially come with an isekai power trip. After all, it\u2019s a show for them. There are many NEET isekai series, some tone-deaf edgefests and others indiscernible carbon copies of each other, but NGNL separates itself with minutae that captures the essence of what it means to be a NEET. The jokes, including the hypersexual ones, border on gut-wrenchingly hilarious for them and uncomfortable for almost everyone else. The chemistry between cast members generates at least a few memorable one-liners and interactions every episode. The constant stream of clever allusions ranging from Skyrim to Laputa to Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei to ICO are bound to elicit grins when noticed. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being an underdog story about NEETs in disguise, but from the beginning it\u2019s evident that all Blank does is win (no DJ Khaled) in this new world - because after all, to beat a RPG you gotta win against every boss. Thus the goal of the series develops into a making the viewer hooked on HOW they win each and every game. While there are brilliant highs, towards the end of the season, the state of the games have gotten to the point where the constant victory really does begin to dull the suspense to the point where the result of the final game itself came of as anticlimactic, bordering on deus ex machina. Nonetheless, it would be ingenuous to not expect gaps of logic, plot armor, and minor plot holes, but none of them are particularly questionable or bothersome enough to reduce the quality of the series at large. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other side, the highlight is the sudden Shiratori game with Jibril, unsurprisingly the only character who can keep up with the Blank siblings' craziness, where the intensity and cleverness of each response ratcheting up to another level. It was the first and only moment where it felt like our heroes could actually LOSE while we watch hydrogen bombs and stars explode because of a fucking simple children's word game - all while laughing (hysterically, I might add) at the sheer preposterousness of it all. Blank\u2019s other challengers haven\u2019t had the same spark as Jibril (who, in classic RPG fashion, later becomes an ally) - and it makes one think they really could use an equally insane foil or antagonist to bring out their best. \\n\\n\r\nThe substance of NGNL itself is its style, and it works wonders thanks to its burlesque tone. The balance is extreme, but not much of a departure from Imaishi and Masaaki-directed works. What makes NGNL is different is how specific it is, how every stratagem is explained and everything happens for a reason. Which is why for NGNL to truly connect on an emotional level, it has to specifically dedicate time towards making the viewer care about the characters and the world they find themselves in. It struggles in this regard. Much of the direct characterization throughout these first twelve episodes of NGNL suffers from ubiquitous lack of meaningful development. To an extent, this was to be be expected due to the nature of the series, but some of the attempted subplots fall flat because of this. \\n\\n\r\nSteph is the most prominent contributor, because she serves as a foil for Sora and Shiro and should be an easiest character to relate to on a basic level (basically she's a fucking normie). However, her sobbing about her grandfather, the disgraced former king of who gambled his land away in hopes of future prosperity, is sappy at best and annoying at worst. Her inner back-and-forth of whether to trust Sora as a leader or not was painfully half-baked, contrived, and thoughtless. Moreover, it\u2019s difficult to care too much about Izuna\u2019s inner struggle about her sense of duty or Fiel\u2019s bond to Kurami when they\u2019re explored for a few scenes and pass by like a floating piece of debris in a hurricane. This can even apply to NGNL's more compelling and fun characters: take Jibril for example, a deserved fan favorite who shifts between (literally) drooling over the prospect of gaining precious knowledge to reminiscing about the days where she could indulge in her psychopathic tendencies of slaughtering anyone in her way. Sora and Shiro themselves have a quirk where their usually badass, composed personalities become useless and complete wrecks when they\u2019re away from each other. \\n\\n\r\nThis tendency to just throw schizoid personality traits out there and hope they stick is the most telling sign that thus far, NGNL has abandoned even barebones exposition. Random behavior is dismissed with the notion that every character acts with some form of inherent spontaneity instead of possessing a fluid train of thought. These developmental aspects are double-edged swords that inject off the wall personality to the series that adds to the fantasy, while also hinder the viewer from taking NGNL's actual narrative or the aforementioned subplots too seriously. We\u2019re left in the dark about relationships, individual vulnerabilities, and motivations. By consequence, a lot of the details dull the quality for this individual season but set up for reveals and more backstory later on. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of the worldbuilding and characterization itself is represented through the heightened sense of verticality, with rapidfire cut changes. This, along with Madhouse\u2019s high-contrast neon color palette and quirky artwork distinguishes Disboard as one of the most picturesque, eccentric, and effervescent isekai settings I've ever seen animated. Often, right after heavy action sequences full of zooming movements and aerial shots, the cinematography shifts to juxtapose our larger-than-life characters to an even more larger-than-life world. This imbalance creates a lingering sense that the characters are small and caged, giving the viewers the sense that someone (remember Tet?) is constantly watching, and there is much much more to the game that is yet to come. Furthermore, the voice acting especially for Sora, Shiro, and Jibril is bonkers and felt incredibly fitting for their characters. The BGM itself isn\u2019t a highlight, but it\u2019s solid throughout - playful or intense when it needs to be, whereas Konomi Suzuki\u2019s opening, This Game, with twinkling pianos and soaring vocals sets the mood, and I\u2019m definitely going to try to learn (and fail) how to play it. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s undeniable that NGNL has the scope and potential to be truly massive in every sense of the word. Seriously, the setup has every indication that this world-building could lead to a inordinately expansive and nuanced universe, much like other long-running light novel series such as Index, Spice and Wolf, or Mondaiji (similar premise also withstanding). Sora and Shiro are bent on challenging god, and you have every reason to believe they will. Still, it's disappointing that the season peaked at episode six, the shiratori match with Jibril and by the twelfth episode, much of the novelty has already begun wearing off. Yet despite the minor speed bump, the sense that there is so much potential with the world of Disboard never fizzles out and we\u2019re reminded of that with how the first season ends - with a cliffhanger materializing from thin air. Zero fucking warning on that, by the way. With many more volumes to adapt, things can only get bigger; whether they get better has yet to be seen. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: read the whole review pussy btw it\u2019s a ostentatiously fun/bizzare show that\u2019s probably not for everyone if they just don\u2019t get the gratification/fanservice/always winning/self-parody/otaku power fantasy stuff. still, mostly it\u2019s functionally a prologue and maybe the first few bosses of this bigger NGNL rpg that sets the script for following seasons/volumes so don't expect it to have any real juicy plot meat if you know what I'm sayin because it's served up undercooked here. but i can\u2019t say this enough: the shiratori game with Jibril was fucking awesome.",

            "content": "I don't normally write reviews, mainly cause I don't think that many people will be interested in my totally subjective opinion, but this time I decided to make an exception. Mainly cause I can't stand to see so many people slamming this series with the same repeating arguments, completely ignoring the positives.\r\nAs I've said, I have very much subjective and in many ways probably biased love for the series.  I assume it's mainly because it saved me from the rot of meaningless flashy series, where fan service replaces  story and various \"grabs\" are there instead of plot twists. But isn't this virtually thesame? I have to strongly disagree.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, lets get the initial impressions out of the way. Art here has a nice modern touch, clean graphics, tight animations and it's nice to see designers using after processing to add a style, not to obscure shabby production quality. Although I think style overall suits modern day setting more than fantasy world, making opening scene and city battle at the end of season most visually impressive. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter design is the only complaint I can rise here, mainly among humans. Not that it's bad, but somewhat samey. Good thing we have 15 more races to look at.\\n\\n\r\nNow, regarding the setting itself, I kinda love it. On surface it looks uninspired: yet another parallel world where main character gets wisped away to, fantasy races, magic, dragons and villains. Oh and there's a princess also, who falls in love with main character, but she's kind of tsundere. Oh and they live in her castle.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's what makes this one of my favorite series: the ability to take the most overused and boring setting, so dull, that Le Blanc de La Valli\u00e8re, Louise Fran\u00e7oise might confuse it for her homeworld, and twist it in to something crazy and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nYes, we had anime about games before, be it SAO, Log Horison, Ragnarok or //hack, but they all tried to bring real life in to game, while NGNL does the opposite: it brings the game back in to life. If anything, it's closer to Kaiji, just less depressing and unfair.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I really like about the subject, is that unlike majority of game related or themed anime, this one manages to appeal to gamers as a whole, instead of pandering to or focusing on Asian aspects of gaming, specifically their mmos and VNs. Yes, tehre's still influence, but it's not so absolute. I don't mind watching things like SAO and Log Horizon to better understand tropes and intricacies of Asian gaming, but for once I want something I can just enjoy and relate to.\\n\\n\r\nIt saddens me how few gamers I see around here, or at least it seems so, cause how else would one explain such widespread misunderstanding of setting and main focuses of the series. For me it's an amazing, impossible world, for once created by gamers, not just for gamers. It's as MCs said in the first episode: real world has no clearly defined rules or objectives and everyone makes whatever moves they want, i.e. just a shitty game.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a fantasy of any gamer to be unbeatable at everything, so it makes easy for me to relate to MCs. They also manage to avoid the oh so common trope that being transported in to a different world makes you slow and docile.  MCs get right to business abusing the world for their own gain and enjoyment and it's a breath of fresh air from typical goody two shoes I will protect you OJSB of a MC that we have so often. \\n\\n\r\nBut the one thing that can make or break series for me is humor. Will it make me laugh or cringe? Will I be bored enough to check how much of an episode  is left? Well, NGNL managed to do something anime has failed for me since Lucky Star: it made me literally laugh out loud every episode, to the point where my room mates would come over to check if I'm going insane or not.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to pinpoint exactly what made me like it so much, probably the combination of verbal humor with spot on body humor, references , selfish attitude and in-jokes between the siblings. That, combined with the general gaming theme made it easy to digest and relate.\\n\\n\r\nIf one would take the plot and development at face value, it would on impress much, a rather generic battle to save humanity and prove that they are not the weakest. But you need to move away from typical anime tropes to realize that it's not about humanity, beating the god or any other vague \"greater good\". This anime is really just about two siblings, gamers, who are having fun in a world they understand very well. Everything they do is to advance their own agenda.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I do have to mention though. Sound, overall, was serviceable, but what annoyed me the most was soundtrack. It felt... uninspired. Both in terms of opening/ending and music during the show itself. One would think that by this time directors understand the advantages of memorable music, but here it was mostly generic fantasy/fighting anime scores, completely alien to the nature of the show. I strongly feel that having some metal/electronic (or better both!) mash-ups would of suited gaming theme a lot more.  Not to mention that they have quite a few gadgets along with them, yet they rarely use them for anything than taking notes or reading books.\\n\\n\r\nOne final thing I need to cover is fan service. To be completely honest here, first time I've watched the series, I did not notice it at all. Considering that I'm not a fan of it normally, it was rather strange. It took me a second viewing to realize what was different. It fitted, which happens never. Both MCs lived in a world exposed to ungodly amounts of it, to the point where it became somewhat of a background thing. As a result they were using it for their own entertainment, as opposed of ham-fisted\"accidents\" that plague anime nowadays. It was also employed by them for their own need, be it to tease or to distract, as well as a  nice addition the their, honestly, rather unhealthy relationship. I can only wish that, if we have to have fan service, it would be done in similar, organic way. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have it, this is why I don't normally write reviews, I tend to get carried away.  As a conclusion, I would say that NGNL is often misunderstood for mediocre anime riding on populat tropes, but I see it as an amazing melding of Asian and western cultures. We learned to enjoy Asian quirks and their way of life, but this one hits it close to home, to a closer culture. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a must see anime for anyone, but you might not understand what it's trying to do, but that's normal with anime, isn't it? And if you consider yourself a gamer, it's a wonderful treat, something that rarely happens outside of youtube.",

            "content": "-Spoilers Ahead-\r\nHere's the obligatory premise of the show for this review because I'm assuming you can't read the Synopsis up there due to allergy or something: Sora and Shiro have tremendous gaming skills and are bored with the regular world. A message arrives for the siblings, and when they open their message, they are stunned to see the scenery around them change to a world they had never encountered before. They've been summoned by Tet to... \r\nYes, the premise is pretty much a carbon copy of Mondaiji-tachi. In fact, it's so similar that I had to actually check when the respective light novels were released.They're both about incredibly talented kids getting sucked into a different world because they're too special for boring human world, and they play \"games.\" Even the visuals are strikingly similar in that they're both incredibly colorful. But hey, you can't exactly be always original- Technically speaking, every show could be considered a carbon copy of some other show that came before, and being uncreative doesn't really detract from the quality of the show. That's not the problem here. The visuals and music are fine too, although it does overuse that one track a lot when the MC explains his plan. \\n\\n\r\nBut the visuals are the least of its problems- The two main characters, Sora and Shiro, are simply put, Stus. Everyone loves Stus as main characters, so why not? Izayoi from Problem Children was a huge Stu too, beating the shit out of everything with next to no effort, and these two are no different. They're just incredibly talented at everything and their only supposed weakness is that they have to be together at all times. Thankfully this weakness is actually never an issue except when it's relevant, and outside of that, it's played for comedic effects. And even if it ever would pose a serious problem, it's usually resolved by one of the two planning something out before the weakness actually happened in the first place, so it's just a pretend label. It doesn't make them any less of Stus. Unfortunately, many people seem to think this is actually a valid weakness, and therefore, doesn't make them Stus. It really isn't. \\n\r\nAt least they're not Tatsuya, right? \\n\\n\r\nThey're not the only problem, of course. Stephanie Dora is this incredibly obnoxious character who pretty much exists for a comic relief. In fact, literally every episode involves making fun of this character for being stupid, and it never ends. So much that even the fanbase now associates her name with the term \"stupidity.\" Making fun of a character for being stupid is funny the first time. Maybe the second and third. Not so much after when it becomes an established fact. \"Ha, the sky is blue! So funny!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Jibril. Her introduction to the series is just so terribly done that it's almost offensive. There's no foreshadowing whatsoever to her existence, and when it's brought up, it just turns into \"Oh, Steph was stupid. Guess that's why she didn't tell us about this character that didn't exist until this point in plot.\" And after she's introduced, she's mostly written as an exposition character that just explains all the world building for the watchers instead of letting the viewers figure things out by themselves. This also serves to mediate Steph's complete uselessness as a character because the author realized it wouldn't be a nice idea to have a recurring side character whose only purpose was to be a comic relief. \\n\\n\r\nI think simply claiming they're Stus isn't really enough to convince anyone, so I'll be more elaborate. But I can't exactly explain that in detail without explain this other thing. And that other thing is the title's namesake; Games! \\n\\n\r\nMaybe the series was trying to be clever with its title \"No Game No Life\" because there hardly is anything that can be categorized as an actual \"game\" in this series. The biggest problem with these  so-called games can be summarized like this: \"Oops, I win.\"\\n\\n\r\nSince most of the episodes have games in them, I'll just explain how each was handled- \\n\r\nFirst episode doesn't explain how Sora won the game. He just did, and you're supposed to accept it. Third episode is a chess game where the rules don't really exist. It's supposed to technically play like a chess, but there really are no established rules- If you're the main character and give a speech, apparently you're rigged to win. Am I supposed to be impressed yet? Fourth episode doesn't have a game, but it breaks character- Sora and Shiro are supposed to be scared of crowds, but in this episode, they get over it pretty quickly as if that was never a problem in the first place. Then they proceed to give an incredibly cliche speech about how the weak can become strong. A speech that's not even really reflective, since Sora and Shiro were never \"weak\" in terms of their gaming prowess, or inspiring since the speech was practically nothing. The entirety of fifth episode is Steph being called an idiot, and a sequence of games that just follows what the series did with the first episode. Sora just \"wins\" them all, and the few ones that he does explain how he won, is just completely out of some puzzle book. Brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nSixth episode is where Jibril is introduced, and it's sadly considered one of the \"better\" episodes in the series. The game here could have been well done, but it's really just a mess. The game's victory hinges on the fact that Jibril does not know about the planet's structure. How could have Sora known this? What if Tet's magic world planet had a different structure from Earth? This is even before Sora had access to Elkia's library, so he wouldn't have known that wasn't common knowledge. Furthermore, Elkia isn't exactly the most knowledgeable nation- He claims that he supposedly figured out in the middle of a game by seeing how she reacted, but she could've been just as easily pretending. But it just so happens that she doesn't know about his win condition. It's a victory that just happened with assumptions and guesses, and apparently this is supposed to make the MC look like a genius. Really?\\n\\n\r\nBreaking off a bit from this pretend game nonsense, seventh episode manages to be the best episode in the series- Instead of Sora pretending he's smart over something he got completely lucky over, the audience get decently written characterization and not as forced exposition. That about sums up every compliment I had for this show. Everything afterwards just builds up to a very disappointing finale- Though, not before informing the watchers that Shiro is definitely helpless without Sora. Except not really, because Sora is still there, you see. What happens is that Shiro is supposed to play a piece on a board game that she can't see. This board game was being played by Sora and an another character. But apparently since she's a \"genius,\" she can predict where he's going to place the pieces, and know exactly where to put it. Except that, the game wasn't called Solitaire. I'm sorry, but it's logically impossible to exactly predict the game state of Othello from knowing just half of the game. Of course the show doesn't explain how this was done. It's just brushed off as Shiro being a genius and knowing everything about Sora, and that was the key to victory. It's all the more offensive when you realize that the victory of this game is what also later helps Sora to win the final game in the series in a domino effect. \\n\\n\r\nThe finale attempts to make Steph seem relevant by having her pull the final trigger. Too bad she didn't actually do anything. Sora and Shiro planned her to do it! Genius! This last episode's supposed \"moral lesson\" is completely insensible too. It keeps repeating the line \"when was the last time you had fun playing a game?\" If people are putting something big like continents and people's lives at stake, it'd be borderline psychopathic to find fun from playing a game putting that at risk. I don't get the \"moral lesson\" here. Is this show telling me to completely disregard everything except having fun? I guess Russian Roulette was a popular party game too. Possible bullets to the head? YES! GOTY! 10/10 IGN. Why aren't you having fun? Are you stupid or something?\\n\\n\r\nThis particular game is also flawed in that their winning strategy also hinges on the fact that the enemy does not notice something that they later claim to be able to notice. Good thing they didn't the first time! Those stupid warbeasts! Even though an entire continent is at stake, they can't even put up that much of a caution! Again, this is not planning. It's luck. Sora gambles, and wins. You can't just win the lottery, make a smug face, and call yourself a genius. But this is what this show does. Every single time. It's not even pretentious in a sense that it's trying to do something remotely clever- Because it's not even fucking remotely clever. \\n\\n\r\nI also don't understand why Sora/Shiro are separate characters. Shiro is just literally Sora, without the smug attitude, being a fanservice bait, and doesn't have much of a personality outside of being incredibly clingy. The show also plays out their relationship far too much to the point that it's creepy. But then again, that's what these shows seem to do these days: Incest is ok, because they're not actually blood-related siblings. This show also constantly hammers in the point about how \"Blanks can never lose\" and that both siblings make up Blanks to an extent that it's incredibly annoying. Of course they can never lose- They're the fucking MCs and the plot bends itself backwards to LET them win. Furthermore, you pretty much know that Sora and Shiro will win no matter what. They always bet something to the point that if they lose, the series would probably be over, so you know that they can't lose. There is no sense of anticipation or whatsoever. Then after winning through some poorly explained method which this show constantly nudges you about how clever it was being, Sora just makes that same fucking smug grin.  \\n\\n\r\nSo yes. The biggest problems with the show supposedly about games is the games themselves, and the characters playing them. The series also constantly teases about how exciting things were before Tet became the absolute God. It's almost like it's self-aware. Lovely. \\n\\n\r\nThis series could've been better if they didn't constantly play these games where cheating is more encouraged than making actual strategies within the game's boundaries. See, games are fun to watch because you want to see what the characters can do within their own boundaries to actually win in a clever manner. It's also fun to watch because you don't really know who will win. But due to the whole retarded \"Cheating is fine as long as it's not caught\" rule in the show, the author is given the freedom to not write anything remotely intelligent. All he needs to do is just say Sora won because he did something that was outside of game's design and that just made him win despite the fact that it would be near impossible in practice. And hopefully it's just as impossible for this show to get a second season. \\n",

            "content": "No Game No Life(NGNL) is a wish-fulfillment show in which the protagonists are given an entirely arbitrary world in which they are the best at what governs that world: games. Wish-fulfillment, you say? Yeah, I am grouping this one up there with SAO, and I don't think I'm in the wrong when doing so. I mean, Sora's backstory is literally him getting awful grades and not giving a shit about what his parents say. It's the classic angsty mentality \"me vs. the world\" or \"nobody understands me\" type of mentality that many adolescents feel they are driven into, and this show plays off of that.\\n\\n\r\nIt revels in its otaku culture, but what's interesting is that it's actually quite self-aware of what it's doing. The show constantly makes light-hearted jokes about otaku hikkimori NEET or whatever you want to call it culture, and so it is clearly very aware of the innate flaws these people face socially and mentally. HOWEVER, it fails to self reflect in every way possible. It clearly can identify problems in its vile nature, but it only wants to make a joke out of it. Sort of like \"I don't care what society thinks, in fact, I don't even want to participate in your system.\" which is kind of what Sora's mentality towards his parents is anyways. What do I mean by self-reflect? Well, the only NEET/hikkimori show I even think is good is Welcome to the NHK, so that gives you an idea of what kind of catharsis I'm looking for.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, it's supposed to grip you with intense games. It's supposedly even more exciting because you're allowed to cheat in these games. At first glance, this seems like it makes it even harder for our god-like protagonist, but when you think about it... not really. Because magic is allowed, many shortcuts can be taken in how exactly the author writes about how Sora/Shiro beat the enemy. The classic example is the chess game. That wasn't even about games. It looked to me like lazy writing. With magic, it becomes easier for the writer to come up with ways for the protagonists to win. The writer doesn't even have to know jack shit about game theory, as he can avoid the subject entirely. This show is the kind of show that actual manga/anime about game theory like Liar Game and Kaiji will laugh at and shit on. This links to another problem I had with his show...\\n\\n\r\nEverything pans out too perfectly. Once again, at first glance, many of these games look as though they are won through wit, intellect, deduction, logic, etc. etc. etc. When you really think about it, there ARE actually quite a few loopsholes or unanswered explanations in this show when it comes to its games. However, the story always pans out to make Sora/Shiro look like gods. I have a problem with this but I can certainly see someone enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, I don't really have any complaints. I thought there was definitely too much fanservice, but it could differ. People will say things like \"but every show  some fanservice!\". No, not really. Some shows don't need to use fanservice and moe to drive up their BD preorders. Some shows care about the story/characters alone. See: Mushishi, Tatami Galaxy, or Ping Pong, which aired in the same season as NGNL.\\n\\n\r\nThis show doesn't really put forward any clear themes, ok actually the only one it does is the angsty rebellious one I get from Sora/Shiro's backstory combined with the fact that this show is about how overpowered they are in this arbitrary world. It doesn't meaningfully resonate whatsoever, and normally the \"dumb entertaining fun\" shows get a 5, because they really are your average entertaining fun shows, but in this case the intrinsic problems I had with its setup and the fact that the games weren't all that great for me lead me to rate it a 4/10. I'll admit 2 or 3 episodes were decently entertaining, but other than that I'd much rather be watching a serious show just because that's more my taste.\\n\\n",

            "content": "No Game No Life is a clear example for the anime community of overconfidence. It's a story of Sora and Shiro, an expert gaming duo, sent to another world where everything is settled through games. While this may appear to be simply following the hype of Sword Art Online as other animes have done, this is actually a much more advanced and original premise than meets the eye. \r\nUnfortunately, the shows only aspect in its favor is the story's usage of different and unique games in order to settle disputes. The rest of the anime leaves much to be desired, simply applying clear attempts togain popularity and providing poorly written characters to drag along the plot.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering there is not much to discuss as far as the story without providing spoilers, the most important reason as to why I do not recommend this anime would be due to its excuse for characters.\\n\\n\r\nStarting off, we have our 1st protagonist, Sora. Sora is Shiro's older step-brother who is practically designed to be unlikable. While many anime characters are perverted in nature, Sora is just down right despicable. Using his skill as a gamer he forces a girl to fall in love with him and with the help of Shiro, proceeds to provide her with belittling comments and sexual harassment on a level that can never be justified. Furthermore, rather than actually establishing a unique and developed character for Sora, he's written as a clear Lelouch Lamperouge copy, mimicking the star of Code Geass' intellectual prowess without having the same charisma that makes a fan of Code Geass love the protagonist. It's this sloppy writing that exposes the empty characters we are seeing on screen.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto our next gaping flaw in No Game No Life we have Shiro, Sora's younger and impressively less likable sister. While Sora at least had some semblance of a character, Shiro is just a part of the show. She does things that help the plot sure, but she's not deep in the slightest. Her only noticeable trait aside from being a gamer is that she is overly protective of her brother. She constantly gets worked up when another female interacts with Sora, going as far as to take one girl's clothing, including underwear, and having her dress up as a dog before being tied to a pole in front of the townspeople. It's these types of moments that make No Name No Life so mediocre. It's having our main female character be abusive to another relevant member of the cast without any sort of reprimanding that makes her painful to even watch. Such actions on her part make her extremely unlikable and unfortunately this is her only aspect to her character with noting. Other than this, she's just a piece of cardboard that can somehow speak.\\n\\n\r\nNo Game No Life is not the greatest anime of all time; in fact its not even good. Quite honestly, this is one of the most overrated animes I've ever seen. If you want to see people have an engaging battle of the minds, watch either Death Note or Code Geass. If you want to watch overly unnecessary fan-service and some of the worst written characters in anime, only then can I ever recommend No Game No Life. While the games themselves are an engaging part of the overall experience, the rest is a train wreck that shows that a good concept still needs strong writing to be successful.",

            "content": "It's not uncommon for one to wish themselves out of a certain situation. Whether it be from an instinctual desire for a grander lifestyle or the pursuit of happiness, one's desires vary from person to person. This may also be what appeals to many who are fans of roleplaying or out of body experiences. The desire for what one cannot have has driven many to madness, and this topic has been used by many forms of entertainment over the years. What No Game No Life does with this topic is shows what can be accomplished when the main character takes what he has learned andapplies it to a world devoid of impossibilities. And when it comes to a world of impossibilities, there's no one better qualified to conquer it than those who follow their head instead of their heart. Actually, it probably wouldn't matter either way.\\n\\n\r\nTo accurately pinpoint exactly what No Game No Life is, one could describe it as two siblings trying to overthrow the god of a fantasy world after beating him in a game of chess. But overthrowing a god is no easy task. Firstly, they must overthrow the entire world. Whether taking over the fantasy world will even accomplish their goal is based on a presumption the main character conceived. But he's never been wrong once since entering the fantasy world, so it'd be better to go along with it. The presumptions of anything logically possible play into this world of impossibilities. No Game No Life makes it clear early on that anything worth thinking about doesn't belong in the games played in the fantasy world. Games can be won through ridiculous means. The games that are played are all conveniently geared towards the main characters' strengths. With each and every game, the characters inch closer and closer to their goal of overtaking a god. Despite everything, No Game No Life's progression is very straightforward. It doesn't try to take itself beyond the stars and it doesn't try to meddle in any unnecessary sub-plots. Most attention is dedicated to one singular mission, as stated above.\\n\\n\r\nAs one of the rules of the fantasy world, the denizens of said world must have fun and play games together. At its core, No Game No Life is just fun and games. When the characters aren't plotting for world domination, they're making jokes and pop culture references. The attempts at comedy during the course of the series are mostly reliant on exaggerated reactions and gratuitous fan service. While they can produce a snicker at times, it mostly feels like a cheap trick more than anything. The fan service usually comes at the expense of the female members of the cast, as a majority of the cast is, indeed, female. Whether it be from the results of a game or a part of the games themselves, it's safe to say that clothing will be removed in some fashion or another. The balance between silly and serious tends to lean more towards silly more often than not. This doesn't harm the validity of the plot much, as the plot is hard to take seriously regardless.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't take a veteran to be able to recognize the faults within the characters. With almost each and every character, there's something off about either their presentation or personality, something that goes deeper than how it appears. With a character such as Sora, the main character and only male among the main cast, you get a lanky, angsty kid who's supposedly too smart to appreciate his own world, so he does whatever he can to entertain himself. Once in the fantasy world, he quickly applies the rules to his situation and takes full advantage of them with one fell swoop. With every challenge, he dominates the opponent with the arrogance of a true king. By being nothing special socially, he acquires the admiration of all of his suitors without even trying, yet was unpopular in the real world. This implies that he could be the world's greatest human being, he just didn't care to put in the effort in his original life. Every quality of his character screams of a self-insert and moans of wish fulfillment. They combat this by giving him faults, like being a pervert or being unable to handle the outside world. But by doing this, they're making him all the more perfect. No one is perfect, so let's make him pseudo-perfect. It's perfectly despicable.\\n\\n\r\nOther members of the major cast aren't as loathsome as Sora, but still fall under the category of cliche or fan service, especially Sora's sister, Shiro. She's small, cute, quiet, and has an abnormal hair color. She also has an insatiable appetite for her brother's affection. All of these traits were manufactured especially for moe. And the icing on the cake is that she's adopted, so her desire for her brother's affection is excused, but still unwelcome. Shiro is essentially walking fan service. Stephanie Dola, the klutz, is one of two major characters born in the fantasy world. She is constantly teased for lacking the intelligence that all other characters share, despite being fairly intelligent in other matters. She is the source of most of the comedy and the fan service in the show, which makes her role within the show feel more shallow. As a character, she contributes little and goes nowhere in terms of growth, making her little more than a stock character. The last of the major characters is Jibril, a fairy-like creature who's thirst for knowledge is as creepy as Sora's expressions. She's more useful than Stephanie, and has a more likable personality, too. Of all the characters, she feels the most human, despite not being human. And as a member of the female race, she's subject to more fan service than one could ask for. Whether this matters is strictly based on the individual viewer's taste.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that was apparent with No Game No Life was its style of presentation. The artwork is reminiscent of Kamisami no Anai Nichiyoubi, whose creamy atmosphere created an effect of dreary depression and bubbly optimism. No Game No Life's art style is similar to a degree, as the brightness is on par with the sun's rays. The palette of color seemed to favor those with a calming, yet alluring power. Purple, maroon, light blue, and dark red are the colors that stand out most while watching this title, and their combination makes for a stunning outcome. Unfortunately, this type of presentation can be a little overbearing at times, as the lighting can sometimes make the characters blend in with the background or appear a tad too bright. The animation itself is one to be praised. It's charming, efficient, and bold; three things that can make an average anime look fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, No Game No Life is interesting. The plot isn't anything as spectacular as it presents it and the characters are atrociously written, but it at least looks like a modern epic. The characters may be flat, but their interactions are humorous at times, granted they aren't playing games. Regardless of all of the flaws, it's entertaining to the highest degree, granted those who view it aren't too cynical. It has the qualities to succeed, it just uses them through means of popularity rather than quality. If anything, if one doesn't care to continue viewing No Game No Life, they can imagine themselves in a world outside of their grasp, similar to those within the series. It wouldn't hurt.",

            "content": "\"There's no way to know the rules or the goal, yet there are 7 billion players making whatever moves they want. There are no parameters and no way to even know the genre. This world is just a crappy game.\"\r\n \u2012 Sora, No Game No Life\r\nIs it really that bad? Real life is a wide open sandbox game with the most realistic physics and graphics in existence. \r\nNo Game No Life is a show that is full of games and tactics. Just one problem: they don't work. And I don't mean some small loopholes here and there. The very foundation of the tactics requires knowingthings that are beyond realistic human knowledge. As a result, there is zero tension in this show. This is not Kasparov vs Deep Blue, this is playing against a psychic who can list every move you will make before the game has even begun. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is already ridiculous. A pair of NEET shut-in siblings, Sora and Shiro, are known online as invincible players who have never lost in any game whatsoever, no matter the genre or how luck-based the game is. \\n\\n\r\n...Yes, really. That isn't an exaggeration; they are completely invincible.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the show, the viewer learns how they achieve this: by being omniscient. They know how anyone will react in any situation. They know what moves their opponent will make without seeing the game board. They know what words their opponent will use in a word game. They can figure out the inner workings of a video game the first time they are playing. They know how flipped coins will land. \\n\\n\r\n\"There is no such thing as luck in this world. Rules, prerequisites, psychological states... There are any number of invisible factors that combine to produce an unpredictable but inevitable result. The victor of a game is decided before it even begins. There is no chance.\"\\n\r\n \u2012 Sora explaining why his tactics work\\n\\n\r\n...Hang on a second. If the result is \"unpredictable,\" then that is what normal people usually mean by luck. When people say that e.g. poker has luck, they are not referring to some quantum fluctuations but simply the lack of knowledge of the order of the cards. So while it's a nice play on semantics, it does very little to actually justify Sora's tactics. For him there is nothing unpredictable.\\n\\n\r\nHow exactly are we supposed to emulate their tactics in real life? We can't, can we? The whole appeal in something like Liar Game is that the tactics actually work for actual human beings. Of course there is no limit to what you can do in a piece of fiction if the author makes a character omniscient, but where is the fun in watching something like that? Calling it wish fulfillment is an understatement.\\n\\n\r\nSo if it isn't about tactics, what is the show really about? Fanservice with the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the skull. Bath scenes, breast grabs, tentacles, incest, animal girl fetishes, and obsession over a 11-year-old's panties should come as no surprise, but in addition we have nipple-erasing magic, boob-enlarging magic, and dragging a practically naked girl through the streets on a leash as \"the dog for the day.\" \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, if you aren't into nonstop fanservice, it gets tedious really fast. Even in the middle of a game, the characters are just as interested in fanservice as winning. The jokes are all about boobs, panties, and the like. The dialogue includes such gems as \"I'm a healthy young man, you know? I've got sexual needs, and sexual needs, and sexual needs! And even sexual needs!\" The show is trying to appeal to the most primitive aspects in our savannah monkey brains, assuming that awkwardly shoving mammary glands at the viewer is enough to constitute a well-written show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is also full of references. It could work in theory, but too often the references feel so arbitrary that they break the flow of the scenes. For example, what does Legend of the Galactic Heroes have to do with a harem-themed first-person shooter (now there's a natural combo to begin with)? Nothing, but they just couldn't find a way to shoehorn it in otherwise. We get an endless flood of these references, as if ticking boxes on some checklist. Where's the fun in that? It feels like a calculated effort rather than a natural creative product, as if the writers were reading marketing surveys and trend analysis charts while watching 5-second Youtube clips of famous games and anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, back to the plot. Sora and Shiro are cast into a fantasy world where everything is decided by games, courtesy of the local god, Tet. They quickly decide that they don't even want to return to Earth and instead want to become #1 in this world by beating everyone, Tet included. \\n\\n\r\nWhy? To help end oppression and suffering?\\n\\n\r\n...No, of course not. What were you thinking? It's to increase their harem and satisfy their fetishes. This is why taking over the kingdom of animal girls is a top priority.\\n\\n\r\nAny politics or social commentary is handled in the most superficial way possible, reduced to little more than a footnote. I assume there wouldn't have been enough time for bouncing boobs otherwise. Sure, they talk about the weak defeating the strong with their wisdom, but they just leave it at that. Now, guess what, it's easy to say you can beat the strong if you are omniscient. How about you demonstrate realistic means to achieve it?\\n\\n\r\nAnd what was wrong with Earth anyway? In the quote I mentioned earlier, Sora called it a crappy game because there's no way to know the rules or the goal, but is it really any different for this fantasy world? It may revolve around games, but there is no truly universal or objective goal there either. It's just a place with different laws of physics.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, the plot is also left severely unfinished, so don't expect any real conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nThe following subsections are part of the story, but they deserve their own categories.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe games:\\n\\n\r\nAh yes, the main selling point of the show. I honestly liked some of the smaller games, such as the modified rock-paper-scissors and \"when will this bird take off,\" but the alleged main attractions not so much. Many of them aren't particularly tactical to begin with, and the remaining ones are won through simply knowing things you can't realistically know.\\n\\n\r\nFirst-person shooter:\\n\r\nThey can perfectly decipher the movement patterns of the NPCs the first time they are playing, as well as how their opponent will react. I mean, really: they predict both of these up to a few dozen pixels so that they can line a shot that they planned minutes in advance. Oh, and this FPS game is harem-themed, so much time and effort will be spent on trying to strip people by shooting their clothes. Predictably enough.\\n\\n\r\nMaterialization shiritori:\\n\r\nHoping that the other player will use a specific word simply because you used it at one point... The show itself acknowledges that this was a gamble. So one question: if the success of the protagonists is built on luck, why are we supposed to believe they are geniuses? Oh, and it's completely natural that this fantasy world has similar laws of physics to ours, down to the subatomic level. After all, that's what fantasy worlds are known for.\\n\\n\r\nOthello:\\n\r\nThe board becomes invisible, but a third party can join mid-game and figure out where all the pieces are by guessing all the moves taken so far. Sounds legit.\\n\\n\r\nChess:\\n\r\nChess is a game known for its deep strategy. Well, we can't have any of that, so instead it's played by giving the pieces motivational speeches. And by speeches, I mean lines like: \\n\r\n\"The one true, unchanging righteousness in this world is cuteness! Cute makes right!\"\\n\r\n\"By my authority as king, anyone who fights valiantly in this battle will earn the right to bang any woman they like!\"\\n\\n\r\nImagine if Lelouch was giving a speech to his revolutionary force, and instead of appealing to justice he would praise cuteness and promise women as war loot. Indeed, the problem here is not so much that the protagonists are omniscient but rather that the game isn't particularly strategic to begin with, if you can even call this a legit game. Sora, if you dislike the real world because the rules are vague, why is this chess game not a problem?\\n\\n\r\nAnd did the soldiers even get their women afterwards? Sora, you cheap bastard.\\n\\n\r\nCoin Flip:\\n\r\n...Yeah. There is actually a twist to this too, but it doesn't make it any more plausible.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe setting:\\n\\n\r\nThe setting makes no sense even within its own rules. Tet has set in place ten pledges that supposedly tell everything about how the world and its games are governed. I'll just copy-paste them here:\\n\\n\r\n1. All murder, war, and robbery is forbidden in this world. \\n\r\n2. All conflict in this world will be resolved through games.\\n\r\n3. In games, each player will bet something that they agree is of equal value. \\n\r\n4. As long as it doesn't violate pledge three, anything may be bet, and any game may be played. \\n\r\n5. The challenged party has the right to decide the rules of the game. \\n\r\n6. Any bets made in accordance with the pledges must be upheld. \\n\r\n7. Conflicts between groups will be conducted by designated representatives with absolute authority. \\n\r\n8. Being caught cheating during a game is grounds for an instant loss. \\n\r\n9. In the name of god, the previous rules may never be changed. \\n\r\n10. Let's all have fun and play together!\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to guess that there's no way such a short and vague set of rules can work in practice. And indeed, it turns out the authors simply can't handle them with any kind of consistency or in-universe plausibility, and any attempts to explain these problems away simply result in ruining the whole point of the setting and making the world's inhabitants look like imbeciles. Let me be a rules lawyer here for a while because apparently nobody in this fantasy world is. \\n\\n\r\n1) \"Everything is decided by games\"? Nah.\\n\\n\r\nNobody can force you to do anything unless you agreed to it in a game? Wrong. Guess what constitutes a group for rule 7 when it comes to countries? Race, as in species. Apparently you don't have to lose any game to be subject to the whims of this representative of absolute authority. He can bet all your land or even your life by betting the race piece. By the way, none of this is included in the pledges, so it's an implicit rule the author added to keep the story going.\\n\\n\r\nThis pretty efficiently ruins the setting, which is presented as a situation where the most talented can take charge of their own lives without having to fear violence or theft. But in reality, each race is living under authoritarian rule where you can lose your life on a whim due to no fault of your own. I know Tet made this system to replace genocidal wars, but was this the best he could come up with?\\n\\n\r\n\"But you can just challenge the representative to a game to take over!\" Nope, he can just throw an impossible game at you. And everyone who is not the representative would face a massive risk, which would strain society's capacity to function.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, banning robbery doesn't sound fair after you realize how arbitrary ownership is. Some people start with no coins to their name and others are living comfortably in their palaces. Tet, have you ever heard of this guy called Karl Marx? Look him up. That being said, there's nothing forcing people to agree to any transactions or acknowledge any existing currency, so they could simply have the rich starve to death if they liked.\\n\\n\r\n2) People are too often acting as if the pledges did not exist\\n\\n\r\nPeople are too often acting normally, as if the rules did not exist. People go to work as usual and obey the law and the government as usual. We are presented with a society that by all sense shouldn't work the way it does. You can't have both \"everything is decided by games\" and normal society at the same time. If the representative can achieve this... well, then it just ruins the setting, like I was saying.\\n\\n\r\nIn this world there is even hereditary slavery. Why not run away? Of course not, they will beat you up... oh, wait. Also, it can't be that they have gambled away their freedom because it's hereditary. You might try to say, \"The representative can just order them to be slaves.\" Not when the slaves are of another race, and it would destroy any shred of fairness these rules have left.\\n\\n\r\nAnd some countries are apparently democracies. I suppose if the representative can be two people, it can also be an institution... I guess. I'm probably giving way too much credit here; it's more likely the writers forgot about the setting again. \\n\\n\r\n3) Why do people agree to slanted games in the first place?\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest head-scratcher of all. Your country doesn't have to lose territory. Just don't agree to any slanted games. Are they all complete imbeciles? If you are challenged, you can likewise simply choose games where you are sure to win.\\n\\n\r\nWhy didn't the cabinet ministers refuse when Sora asked them to play a game where he wins by default? Yeah, just try to wrap your head around that one. Apparently you can just force people to lose by default. If this is something the representative can do, he could simply order them without playing a game, unless there is some kind of ridiculously specific implicit clause somewhere. \\n\\n\r\n...Screw this, it's obvious the writers just didn't care.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nSora and Shiro: They are inseparable to the point that they freak out when they are placed in different rooms. And I mean that literally. So it's only fitting that I deal with them together. \\n\\n\r\nSora's main purpose in life, other than winning games, is extending his harem and witnessing as much fanservice as humanly possible. Kind of like the show itself. Judging by his portrayal, we are supposed to be proud too. Shiro is a supergenius, as evidenced by the totally legit random equations she writes sometimes. Oh, and she is in love with her brother to satisfy the obligatory \"incest subplot\" quota.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, do you know why they were shut-ins? Because they were literally afraid of stepping through their front door. You see, Sora and Shiro are fine with any form of social interaction if they are in a game. In fact, they are genius negotiators. However, they become helpless the moment they step into the real world. But somehow they are fine in this game-filled fantasy world, even though the world itself is not a game. Basically:\\n\\n\r\nCrowded streets of a fantasy world -> They're fine\\n\r\nEmpty streets of the real world -> They fall into a catatonic state\\n\\n\r\nPlausible human psychology, right? And it really is the streets, not the people. They try both of the mentioned combinations in the show. Sometimes it tries to assert they are really afraid of people, but this is very rare and inconsistent anyway, so it's literally the streets that are the problem. \\n\\n\r\nStephanie: Fanservice, and also standing there to be laughed at for her stupidity and to let Sora and Shiro provide exposition.\\n\\n\r\nJibril: More fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nTet: Barely appears. Has tons of free time, which he refuses to use to help the residents of his world because games are that much cooler than having a functional society. Why is he portrayed as benevolent again?\\n\\n\r\nOther characters: Who cares? They only exist for fanservice or to lose to the protagonists, or are practically irrelevant. \\n\\n\\n\r\nA few words about the technical aspects:\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nDepends on how much you like fanservice and psychedelic neon colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nPretty standard. Nothing really stood out that much as far as the soundtrack and voices were concerned.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nThere is some enjoyment found in pointing out all the flaws in their tactics and the broader setting. Kind of like this review. You might think this show could be so bad it's good, but it's only barely. The show is too confident in its dysfunctional tactics, and many aspects of the show feel like a calculated ratings grab.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nThis show is a thoroughly artificial experience, a seemingly cynical attempt to cash in on the consumer. Their approach was simple enough: shove in as much wish fulfillment, references and fanservice as humanly possible and wait for the money to flow in.",

            "content": "Life is like a game, if you play your cards right, then you\u2019ll win. Perhaps this is more if a metaphorical statement but it is how No Game No Life (NGNL) is constructed as such. Well, not initially but in the mysterious world of Disboard, everything is determined by game \u2013 including your life. But first, we need to trace back a bit. This is because NGNL is based off a light novel of the same name focusing on two main characters and siblings as they conquer through Disboard and become Gods of their world. It\u2019s a game like they have never played before.\r\nWritten byJapanese-Brazilian author Yu Kamiya, the show adapts itself as a fantasy adventure. But unlike a show that takes place in some open world environment, NGNL takes place in a virtual realm full of wonders. And from this world, we meet hikikomori siblings Sora and Shiro. The two are known for their abilities in the gaming world as part a legendary group known as \u201cBlank\u201d (\u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f). Initially, they are considered unbeatable, so much that they are bored with their existence. Fate ties them one day after beating against a mysterious chess player earns them a trip to the Disboard world. \\n\\n\r\nA journey into NGNL will feel a bit anomalous. Think of it as trying to beat a video game but that you are not the one playing but rather as the actual player. For Sora and Shiro, this should initially be a walk in the park for their skills. But all is not as simple with the mechanics and rules in the Diaboard world. There are many concepts such as the \u201cExceed\u201d categorized by 16 different races. The Imanity, the most humanoid of all the races, become a source of prejudice for their weaknesses. As such, the show portrays them as underdogs. However, we have Sora and Shiro to bring back honor and glory to their race. Thus, the show crafts itself as a way of progressing and experimental journey. We witness the siblings\u2019 ascension and rise to the top. Their ultimate goal is to beat Tet, the creator of the world in order to become the One True God. From a perspective point, it\u2019s easy to tell what the show is trying to do with such a premise. There are vast potential development for the characters, world building, and dynamics of its rules. While it seems like one big challenge to tackle for gamers, the show portrays it more than that. Because for those rules, there\u2019s a certain degree of ways to bypass such restrictions. The show depicts itself as more of an experimental product with Sora and Shiro being the professors. Only of course, they also come into this world as gamers, fight with a gaming image, and bring pride to what they fight for. It\u2019s a journey beyond just saving some princess from a castle or win some fame.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to judge the first episode since the show slowly draws itself out with its concepts and characters. But for starters, the main sibling duo of Sora and Shiro is not your usual or typical pair of brother and sister. They are gamers, and while not professional demonstrates a status of unparalleled levels. But what really makes them stand out is the way that they complement each other with their abilities making them nearly omniscient. And unlike most siblings, they have a very dynamic relationship. Neither of them treats each other as superior or inferior but instead on equal standing. Throughout the series, it\u2019s clearly shown that they care deeply for one another. One instance shows Shiro\u2019s deep concern when she finds out that Sora was not with her anymore. Similarly, whenever they are apart, they display the traditional or perhaps stereotypical attributes of a NEET. The focus on the sibling twins is not their development but rather their characters. It\u2019s straight-forward but at the same time unconventional. The gap age difference between the duo might suggest that their skills differ. Yet, they show explicitly their skills individually and collectively to be able to carry the torch to victory. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout their journey to become Gods, the siblings encounter a variety of characters that joins them in their crusade. Joining them includes humans such as Stephanie Dola, also simply known as \u201cSteph\u201d. The show depicts her as a scapegoat after losing to the twins. Her role becomes more like a servant as the siblings adds her on their list of conquered objectives, literally. Then, there\u2019s a more playful Jibril that also becomes somewhat of a scapegoat. But unlike Steph, she\u2019s portrayed as an energetic oddball. NGNL portrays all four of these characters like they are crusaders to fight through the Disboard world. Furthermore, the show often likes to make fun of its own characters by their image and characteristics. For instance, Steph becomes a meme in the show for her master/dog relationship with the siblings. After being a subject to an unexpected order, Steph can be viewed not such as a scapegoat but as a play toy. And really, that\u2019s what their journey becomes like \u2013 a game where they play their way to victory whether it\u2019d be utilizing their minds or through cheating; anything to win because that\u2019s what it matters. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the serious nature of the siblings\u2019 goal to conquer God, the show often makes fun of itself with its characters, concepts, and even references/gags to deliver entertainment. Throughout the show, characters break through the boundaries of logic whether it\u2019d be in chess, rock-paper-scissors, physics, or just gaming itself to unimaginative levels. They create the idea that \u2018games with rules are meant to be broken\u2019. And from my perspective, it\u2019s fun and a blast to get out of. After all, it\u2019s not usually fun to watch someone else play a game than playing it yourself. Yet, this show can deliver a way where you almost feel like you are part of their quest to conquer the world. Furthermore are the concepts and dialogues. Even the various references from other popular cultures can spawn some laughter if noticed. Then, there\u2019s also iconic speeches, misleading dialogues, and gags all ties in to craft NGNL\u2019s unconventional image. Through this execution, the show explicitly presents game formulas beyond just playing for fun. This should have been obvious anyways since the show likes to take daring risks. And although these risks can be appealing, it can also be controversial. The way some characters behave are borderline inappropriate, die-hard, and become a wish- fulfillment fantasy. Through its style, the show also desperately saturates characters and scenes with fan service. Some can feel a bit uncomfortable especially for characters such as Shiro or implied animal innuendos in the case of Steph. It feels irrational and unoriginal with circle of clich\u00e9s most explicitly fueled by the dialogues with its characters and incest undertones. Even the plot/premise itself has some tastes of unoriginality when compared to recent shows such as Problem Children, Accel World, or Log Horizon. Only for NGNL, it\u2019s more about just beating the game through unpredictable outcomes. Some other quirks about the show might involve its romance as at least two characters show interest in Shiro. But most times, the show borders on a harem-esque route as he makes impressions on the ladies. In retrospect, don\u2019t expect any genuine romance development but rather teases without nothing more than a simple foreplay.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse does it again once again with its successful cultural and visual display. The world of Diaboard is illustrated with layers on top of layers of fantasy that destroys any sense of realism but creates that credible mood of being stuck in a virtual realm. The colorful palates are designed with abnormal touches of fantasy at every turn whether it\u2019d be the games, the various landscapes, towns, and characters. Speaking of which, the characters also has credibility with physical appearances to portray them as heirs, gamers, and angels. On the other hand, fan service is explicit and never attempts to hide itself in any way or form with its distracting scenarios. At the same time, it also defiles logic with characters such as Shiro with white hair despite being 11 years old. Yet, every species has a distinctive look to create diversity as well. Hell, we even get to see Shiro wear a crown to show that she is a queen and Sora displaying his philanthropic traits by wearing a shirt with the iconic:\\n\\n\r\nI \u2665 Humans\\n\\n\r\nTechnical prowess also come with its soundtrack. Distinctively directed, each episode makes cleaver usage of its OST for tactical, emotional, and climatic scenes. Character voices are also dynamic with a figurative speech tone. The way characters speak doesn\u2019t feel dull or like a monologue but rather filled with energy. In fact, the soundtrack has doses of hyperactivity when it comes to its presenting gameplay machinations. To meet the end of its style, the OP and ED song are also decorated with attractiveness and catchy tone. One particular episode even makes fun of itself (for plotline purposes) through distorted crediting. It\u2019s needless to say but headphones are a must to get the satisfaction that you deserve.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show that deconstructs game tropes, NGNL also serves as an experimental way to deliver a fantasy adventure. The show often pokes fun at itself whether it\u2019d be cultures, rules, or just in general anything it can get its hands on. While the show doesn\u2019t escape its labyrinth of clich\u00e9s, it also finds way to parody them through clever usage of humorous executions. It\u2019s more than just mindless entertainment as NGNL delivers with energy and exclusive empowerment to appeal audiences by its concepts. The way to enjoy NGNL isn\u2019t to follow the story like it\u2019s some sort of instructional manual but rather as what it intended to be \u2013 gaming level of entertainment. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be biting your gums of logic so much, it'll bleed.",

It\u2019s understandable that NGNL is a fantasy where you can use your wildest imagination and can\u2019t possibly go wrong, but a common mistake thatfantasy anime like NGNL fail to do is abide by its principles. A fantasy still needs some sense of logic for slamming two geniuses who are capable of doing anything into its story. NGNL presents itself as a brilliant, captivating series but progresses to show little-by-little how it moves away from intelligence, proving how the protagonists are not as invincible as portrayed to be.\\n\\n\r\nBlank, a brother-sister duo named Sora and Shiro, is quite peculiar. All of their wins are accomplished by teamwork, and one brain cannot function well without the other nearby. They make their debut as a couple who\u2019s unbeatable and leaks intimidation. NGNL presents these protagonists with unexplained abilities, which makes their brilliance invalid. You learn nothing about Blank besides the fact they\u2019re undefeatable and possess genius-level intelligence. They both suffer from a social disorder that causes them to freak out when separated and gives Sora enough reason to sit outside the girls\u2019 bath to stay within a certain distance of Shiro. Besides a vague backstory of their first encounter, NGNL reveals nothing about their parents, their lives in Tokyo, or any kind of self-narration to back up their intelligence or social disorder. This results in NGNL\u2019s inability to follow through on its brilliance. Despite being undefeatable, Blank faces dead ends, admits defeat, and gets miraculously saved at the last minute. Even if there were changes in games or situations entirely, you\u2019d expect clever approaches from super intelligent protagonists besides raising the white flag. Like always, NGNL disguises such inconveniences with gag comedy references to please jaded views.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the aspects noteworthy in NGNL are the games ranging from as simple as rock-paper-scissors to majorly complex and fun like a simulation game. Blank\u2019s immediate drawbacks and impressive comebacks make it more watchable. The explanations of game plans were interesting. This makes Stephanie Dola a great add to the series, because someone has to play the simple-minded character to dumb down the complex moves and game rules for everyone else to understand. The games have their flaws though. Blank arrives into a world decided by games, ran by 10 pledges, and ruled by a little boy who only became God by default because of incompetent adults. The 10 pledges are a nice gesture to keep world order, but it is just another excuse to make Blank seem intimidating. There\u2019s a pledge that denounces cheating, giving gamers an automatic loss if caught. Most of the games consisted of someone cheating or trying to overcome a cheat. Still, this brings two conclusions. Either Blank is indeed genius, or everyone in the new world is incredibly stupid and uses cheats to hide the fact they lack wisdom and the appropriate skills to win. Blank faces every opponent with a confident attitude, expecting a 100% win. Then the show becomes predictable, because Blank is always right. None of their opponents are challenging enough to take them on. The pacing was just right, so 12 episodes was not enough to fulfill the primary objective and ends with a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the cast is female, giving Sora several chances to play the dominate male and open pervert. This makes characters appear as airheads or suffer high risks for Blank's purposes. The characters vary in personalities and abilities, and NGNL did a great job dividing their abilities based upon their race. Some had their own fetishes as well. Each of them played a role in Blank\u2019s overall objective, so each one has his or her own unique trait whether it\u2019s attractive or vice versa. Since this is a comedy, characters freely act outrageous after a serious moment in an attempt to get a laugh. It is only regarded to a certain extent, because they do not always act appropriately to certain situations, making it hard to distinguish the comedy and seriousness. Their sudden reactions to surprises are mostly hilarious, especially Blank\u2019s reaction when Stephanie says something bright for a change. Some of the characters share backstories and relationships that can possibly give viewers a different impression of them.\\n\\n\r\nNGNL takes ecchi over the top with its fanservice. Awkward clich\u00e9 scenes of falling and landing into boobs make it annoying and close to a harem. Most games consist of girls losing clothes or undergarments sometimes as an excuse for virgin Sora to get his feels. However, I disregard this a little considering that NGNL is clearly within the ecchi genre, so this is expected. I mainly mentioned it as a warning to those who despises the abuse of ecchi fanservice. The only flaw is how this makes every game predictable, because each one seems to need fanservice for strategic purposes or solutions. \\n\\n\r\nThe pastel colors are initially what makes NGNL so lively, and I applaud Madhouse for taking a different approach with unique artwork and animation. As someone who is not a big fan of ecchi, I found it to be tolerable because of the pastel colors. The settings and character design were unbelievably gorgeous, and it is greatly necessary to distinguish the vast races and their territories within the world, including the elves and warbeasts. Except NGNL seems to care more about their appeal than abiding by the law of gravity. Clearly, you cannot hold onto a floating cloth in the sky as if it\u2019s an airplane wing or Aladdin's magic carpet. Characters hang upside down and their hair doesn't follow their lead. Even if gravitational failure is not a big deal, it makes NGNL misleading considering that an arc touched on the concepts of science a great deal, including gravity.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was suitable for the game theme of NGNL, but there are music references from other games to make the OST seem unoriginal. Sometimes it was confusing. NGNL seemed to have a hard time differentiating between comedy and seriousness, and the music gives it away. Something unexpected happens, characters make a big deal out of it, and yet the music is just as cheerful as ever. The OP and ED were very good, and the lyrics fit the show\u2019s theme and Blank\u2019s relationship quite well. There are no complaints about the seiyuu either, because they all switched their tones appropriately during certain situations, especially Blank. They succeeded with the sound effects, too, and it brought out the comedy more.\\n\\n\r\nNGNL was a fun show to watch, and I looked forward to seeing a new episode every week. Impressive strategic gameplay, clever comebacks from Blank, and the beautiful animation with pastel colors are a few things that intrigued me. Despite how much I loved it, NGNL doubtlessly lacked the maturity and logic it needed to achieve the pursuit for powerful, undefeatable characters. The fantasy genre can be imaginative, as long as the show supports their ideas with some kind of explanation like NGNL failed to do. If you want to introduce super intelligent NEETs with an objective to take over the world, perfect. But to make them into something overly invincible with unexplained abilities without any backstory or presentation of evidence? That\u2019s a tough cookie to break. Since NGNL won as the hype of Spring 2014, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that there\u2019s a sequel awaiting us in the future.",

            "content": "Everywhere I go here on MAL I see people praising this show. 10s are almost the standard since this show aired. Almost impossible to escape to the hype surrounding this anime I found myself watching the first episode even though I am against fan-fiction like stories such as this one. So, what do I think of the show?\r\nWell, it has been quite a bumpy road with No Game No Life for me. A surprisingly weak start with almost every clich\u00e9 in just two or three episodes a pandering show like this could ever contain and more headshakes I ever did when watching anime since SwordArt Online were part of this experience. It got gradually more bearable though as the series reached its end to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nWell, let's take a look in what the alleged \"Anime of the Season\" has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nWhen reading the synopsis I was already shaking my head in disbelief. Yet another fan-fiction premise, yet again super cool NEETs living the life 90% of the people here would gladly kill for? I am certain it is unnecessary to tell what No Game No Life is all about since most of you guys reading this are already watching it as well.\\n\r\nLet's rather talk about the problems I had with the story. \\n\\n\r\nAlso note, so far no second season has announced. I will treat the story section of No Game No Life as if no second season is announced when coming to the ending. Yes, I know there is a light novel of the show but we are reviewing the anime here. Not the light novel!\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, No Game No Life tried to achieve so much in just a twelve episode run-time it felt rushed at times just to squeeze in as much as possible. They want to take over the whole world but how much could they possibly get my just twelve episodes? \\n\r\nI guess it may be just me but the whole set up and how it was handled is way too convenient for me to overlook it. Yes, \"Blank\" consisting of Sora and his super-intelligent-NEET-hikikomori-loli imouto providing regular panty shots Shiro are unbeatable, literally unbeatable. The story part of No Game No Life felt like watching a newcomer play Dark Souls for the first time with god mode enabled because just as Blank (I guess I figured out why the name's \"Blank\". Which makes it easier for self-insertion!), he'd be undefeatable no matter how big the challenge may look or what there is at stake. There is no sense of tension because you can predict that Blank will win no matter what. All you do is wait for the resolution on how they did it which is unpredictable because the main characters are alleged geniuses which - for me - was nowhere near this fascinating. Not saying this is all bad, it really is entertaining and gets you by surprise being exposed to their kind of play for the first few times, but most of the explanations just felt like Deus Ex Machina which again could be excused by them being geniuses.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of world building No Game No Life did an average at best job as well. Yes, humanity is now called \"Imanity\" and is on the bottom of the food chain amongst other beings inhabiting this world. But yet again this is hardly explained in detail to make me personally attached at all. Also the other species are as original as it gets with your average elf-like beings using their magic, the war beasts having super-human speed and agility, there is no originality to be found here either. \\n\\n\r\nThe games they play are also not seemingly flawless and even contain plot holes in how they were executed by the show, for example the game of Shiratori in episode 6 where every player  had 30 seconds to make their next move. Because Blank is so perfect though it just takes them almost a whole minute just for one. How things like those get past a quality check seems incomprehensible to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe general pacing was also one of the things which bugged me. Most of the time there just wasn't anything meaningful going on and time got wasted for nonsensical reference humor or blatant fan service which is a thing I highly dislike in anime.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the visuals No Game No Life scored way better at me. I like it when studios try out new stuff and come out as daring especially at something crucial as the visuals. No Game No Life kept an overall decent standard of quality and used an interesting if even maybe unusual and surreal art style as well as fluid animation. To be honest watching the first few episodes it seemed way too surreal and almost unpleasing for me personally. As the time went by though I found myself getting attached to it as it fitted the show\u2019s theme quite well. As said, credit where credit is due, the makers dared to stand out from the norm and delivered a more than solid job in my eyes even if I ended up hating how they made Shiro and her facial expressions with her tiny mouth. This surely is just me but I couldn't stand some of the character designs at all.\\n\\n\r\nComing to the acoustic performance of No Game No Life I just have positive things to say. Starting with a strong and catchy opening theme the series never failed to convey a certain feeling of tension during moments when Blank once again had triumphed over their mentally inferior enemies. The soundtrack is literally what kept me hoping for more to come, being composed very well and used even better in the right scenes. If I had one thing to complain about the soundtrack it would be that some of songs got used to often and lacked in overall variety. Considering their quality this is a thing I am willing to forgive.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also top-notch and leaves barely room to complain, except the characters which they voice acted.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are actually my biggest complaint alongside the not really original and sometimes even rigged by plot holes part that is the story. Blank may be perfect but this is just the thing which won't sell me for No Game No Life. They are too perfect, every of their moves in unpredictable it almost comes off as a downright ass pull - speaking only of the main characters Sora and Shiro though. The rest of the cast is entirely female and besides one tear-jerking moment of Stephanie it gets completely downgraded to pure fan service which is a shame because since later on they threw some other races into the bunch as well which could have been used for great character and world building but was cut to the most essential things and once again fan service because since the \"Flugel\" is a flying race they have their erogenous zones on their wings. Ha-ha, so clever. Not. And of course every female which gets to meet a smelly and skinny NEET is most likely to want to explore his erogenous zones. Totally what would happen in real life! And besides the main cast there were barely important characters which could be used even if only as plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the problems I had with the show, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy No Game No Life the slightest bit. The atmosphere was right during the moments it should have been to grab my attention even when just for a little moment longer than it managed before. The conclusions weren't always the most logical or the most likely ones but satisfying nevertheless if you take the show what it's supposed to be; an entertaining pseudo-intelligent comedy. Regarding the comedy No Game No Life consists of solely two parts of comedic \"attempts\". One would be referential humor and the other being fan service. What I personally missed where clever jokes and not just some sexual slurs or innuendos alongside some deadbeat jokes. The most entertaining parts for me where not the ones others would consider to be funny but for how Blank would manage to achieve the next goal. Not if they would but how - because Blank can't lose.\\n\\n\r\nSumming this up No Game No Life was a decent entry of the wish-fulfillment-genre which must include beautiful women, a super cool and flawless main character, games, video-games, a world to escape to. It stood out using a rather unique art style and underlining it with a very good soundtrack but lacked in story and characterization. Too much time was wasted on fan service which could have been used on actual development of the over sexualized almost all-female cast. While I didn't expect much after reading the synopsis I wouldn't even say I got disappointed but the hype surrounding it seems similar to the one Sword Art Online experienced back in the day. Unlike Sword Art Online No Game No Life is self-aware most of the time and at least does not take itself seriously to a level where it comes off as forced drama. It knows what it wants to be and pulls that off quite nicely and confident, ending up being entertaining but nothing of outstanding quality.\\n\\n",

            "content": "No Game No Life, the anime everyone was talking about this season. Everywhere on MAL and the anime subreddit everyone was praising NGNL. I tried hard to like it but I just couldn't, there was almost nothing redeemable about this show. If the show is bad then why do people watch it? And how did it get so popular? Well I guess I'll try my best to describe, while not spoiling as much as I can. \r\nFirst off I'll start by listing all of the positives about this show, the art and animation was beautiful, nothing less to be expected by MadHouse. The OST wasgreat music at the wrong times, so I'm not sure if I could count that as a positive, but the OST in general is above average. And a colorful and beautiful World with endless opportunities for creativity. \\n\\n\r\nSo the plot is about two NEETs who are brother and sister, win at any game with 0% chance of losing. Why did the author end up making the protagonists NEETS? Well because he wanted to make most of the community who watch anime feel good about themselves. You could pretty much describe every character in one word and know everything about them, for example Sora is a beautiful virgin NEET who is somehow a genius who wins any game possible that's set in front of him. Shiro, who is Sora's sister, does literally next to nothing in the show except act as fanservice for lolicons. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are sadly even more one dimensional if that is even possible. So why does Sora have 3000 favorites then? Well just like Lelouche from Code Geass, or Light from Death Note, Sora is incredibly over powered and every other character in the series is retarded compared to him, we could  say he is the big fish in the extremely small pool. Actually we could say he is the big fish in the small fish tank all by himself since all the other characters are non existent compared to him. \\n\\n\r\nEarlier I mentioned Sora was over powered and that he wins any game 100% of the time, in the series he even says he wins games before they are even played. So in this new magical land that they are brought to, there is no wars, any dispute is solved over games. Games decide everything, even who owns which land. So the games could have been really interesting but you could tell from the beginning, no matter what Sora would win any game so there wasn't much to care about. Although I will admit some of the games mechanics were pretty interesting and MadHouse did an amazing job animating them. \\n\\n\r\nWhenever Sora won a game, the episode would end and we would get 2 or 3 episodes of SoL + fan service shoved down our throats. As someone who loves SoL, a genre that relies 100% on how good their characters are. Well the characters in NGNL are honestly the worst cast I have seen yet, The SoL elements were so horrible that they had to rely on ecchi and fanservice. Hell actually half of the side characters in Sora's harem were only made for fan service, for example an angel who acted as nothing but a slave. She turned a complete 180 from being an angel who had no respect for humans to a slave who is completely loyal in a matter of minutes. \\n\\n\r\nNear the last couple of episodes you could tell that they were running out of ideas and it just started to feel stale. Also the ending was very dissatisfying and didn't come near to bringing the season to a close. I enjoyed watching the show a bit, but that was mostly because MadHouse did such a good job with the art and animation.",

            "content": "Blank can unite this burning land and bring an end to all this Disboard!! (haha puns, Disboard, discord.)\r\n-Overall\r\nNo Game No Life is about 2 NEETs, Sora and Shiro, who are geniuses when it comes to games. They are transported to a world where games decide everything from national borders to theft. Because Sora and Shiro are amazing at games, this world, called Disboard, (haha discord, this board, disboard, hahahaha games haha) seems like their dream world. The art reflects this, with it's unique coloration and artstyle.\r\nThe voices are very well done, and the soundtrack is very fitting. The characters each have comedic elements associated withthem, so depending on the current interactions of characters, different jokes and comedy scenes can be made. This helps freshen up the comedy and keep it new. This show was my favorite this season, and the comedy and bad*ssery that Sora and Shiro did make me hope for a season 2. Personally, I think a season 2 is likely because the anime is receiving so much praise and recognition, and the light novel that the anime is based off of is progressing quickly. \\n\r\nStory: 8.25\\n\r\nArt: 9.95\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.15\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9.27. It's great. \\n\r\nMore details down below.\\n\\n\r\n-Story:\\n\r\nThe story of No Game No Life is well built. First off, the premise is well explained. There is a world where 10 pledges govern sentient beings, and games decide everything. Why this is is explained early on and the pledges are constantly stated to make sure the audience understands the setting. The story is entertaining and progresses quite naturally. Sora and Shiro must take small steps before they take the large ones, and that is reflected in the 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\n-Art\\n\r\nThe art for No Game No Life is amazing. It's unique art style helps create a dreamy atmosphere, reflecting on the fact that Disboard really is Sora and Shiro's dream world. It always looks fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\nThe voices are very well done, and sound very genuine. The music is very good as well, and goes well with the scenes.\\n\\n\r\n-Character\\n\r\nThe characters are lovable. Sora and Shiro are geniuses, and everyone likes geniuses. But they aren't incredibly intellectual, which most of us aren't, making them relatable. Sora is smart, but aside from when he's \"being smart,\" he acts like a (for the most part) like a normal person. Same with Shiro. All the characters provide a comedic aspect unique to that character in the series, and depending on which characters currently have the spotlight, different jokes are made, spicing up the comedy quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\nThis is probably my favorite anime this season, and I always looked forward to watching this show. I'm sad too see it go, but excited for next season.",

            "content": "A lot of popular shows have plenty of problems that are often ignored because they pander to their intended audience and NGNL (No Game, No Life) is no exception. The impressions one would likely get from the hype surrounding NGNL are it\u2019s \u201can amazing show with an original premise and spectacular story-telling.\u201d Though this is mostly exaggeration, as this show is far from amazing, it\u2019s also far from awful for plenty of good reasons. NGNL\u2019s glory stems from how well it knows its audience and that is a point in its favor, but there are definitely issues with it that should be addressed.\r\nIt\u2019s easy toargue that a show with good characters is a good show and NGNL has this aspect covered, whether the former is true or not. A very serious person might laugh at that statement, but that laughter is coming from the ignorance of the characters\u2019 purpose. Each of the characters do their apparent job well and that is to be distinct and interesting as well as appeal to the target audience. The excellence of the cast is thanks to the way the NGNL allows it\u2019s intended audience to relate to it\u2019s main characters and that is a sign of competence from the creators (or that they are lucky).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, though the characters are a high point of NGNL for being interesting, and in a way fun, it\u2019s hard to deny their flaws. For one, our two main characters, the siblings Sora and Shiro, are nearly perfect (ironically, considering I\u2019m saying this is a flaw), and it sucks a lot of the anxiety you might have, and even some of the fun, out of the show. They do seem to be self-aware, but it hardly excuses this problem. In fact, their aptitude in nearly everything is ridiculous considering their circumstances. It\u2019s clear that this probably only to give them \u201ccool points\u201d and cheat its main audience into thinking the characters are well designed (I use cheat loosely). All this is only compounded by how the other prominent members of NGNL\u2019s cast of characters, such as Steph and Jibril, only help boost Sora and Shiro\u2019s ego as they seem to only compliment their incredible skill, both indirectly and directly. Also, it\u2019s unbecoming for the cast that most of the characters are there solely for \u201cfanservice\u201d and other appeal. As such, even though this anime\u2019s characters are \u201cfun and cool\u201d, they aren\u2019t nearly realistic and have exaggerated abilities (and personalities too).\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said about the overall above average cast, it\u2019s unfortunate the premise isn\u2019t as original as plenty claim because similar stories have definitely been conceived and written. That isn\u2019t foretelling of an uninspired plot though, is it? The answer to that question is subjective, but it doesn\u2019t matter that much. The story almost entirely focuses on the siblings, brother and sister, Sora and Shiro as they are brought to an alternate world after beating the god of said world in a game. In this world, everything is decided by games (not violence, debate, etc.) so you\u2019d think this would allow for some creativity involving all the games they will likely be playing. Unfortunately, whoever authored NGNL seemingly always uses a likeness to a Deus Ex Machina as the solution for the siblings inevitably winning the games they play. The way the games are played are less intelligent than they are presented. To be honest, for a show about games, the games aren\u2019t exciting at all because you know the outcome is always that the siblings will win. Also, the story itself isn\u2019t very interesting anyway, as the things that mostly happen are playing games and cracking jokes so NGNL heavily relies on \u201cfanservice\u201d and references which isn\u2019t a strong foothold. It\u2019s good the forced drama is rare though.\\n\\n\r\nThis might put NGNL down a bit, but beneath the unpolished story is a nice setting that is not fully explored. Because Sora and Shiro decide to try defeating and uniting the intelligent races in the new world they arrive in, we get to explore many of the interesting places that said world contains. NGNL doesn\u2019t feed us with a lot of adventure and exploration though, so this could be a missed opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the setting very nicely designed, the animation compliments it too. The animation quality is not top-notch, but it is unique. It\u2019s nice to see something different as the art uses some uncommon colors and has a nice hue of orange.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the voice acting is good as the voice actors do their jobs well. There aren\u2019t any performances of immediate note though. Also, the music is fine, but there is better out there\\n\\n\r\nOverall, even though NGNL will likely leave a positive impression on you, its also good to consider its undeniable flaws. It\u2019s something you\u2019ll definitely like if you land in its target audience range. That means you like random fanservice and the predictable outcome of the games. If you don\u2019t like it, you\u2019ll probably find this anime poor for trying to act smart and tripping like a fool. While NGNL may have an uninteresting premise, its characters and setting make up for a good portion of it. And though it\u2019s not as good as some may claim it to be, it\u2019s an exaggeration to say it\u2019s bad. NGNL is a fun experience, but it\u2019s not all it\u2019s praised to be and not a must watch. You may want to watch it for that orange hue though.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n",

            "content": "Fiction exists as a distraction. There exists many kinds of fiction: comedy, adventure, drama, etc. And then there's shallow wish fulfillment shlock that only exists for the purpose of pandering. Thus, No Game No Life exists.\r\nNo Game No Life is the \"story\" of two NEET siblings, Sora (18 years old) and Shiro (11 years old) who form a team known as \"Blank\". One day, they get sucked into another world called Disboard, wherein every conflict is resolved through games, including political affairs. Thus, when Stephanie, the princess of Elchea, loses her inheritance to the throne after losing a game of poker, Sora and Shiro decideto compete in order to claim the throne for themselves, and eventually conquer Disboard.\\n\\n\r\nYou know all those bad fanfics that are Mary Sue wish fulfillment stories, wherein the main character is a loser in this world, and then they go to another world like Hyrule, or Star Trek, or Middle-Earth, or Equestria, or Idontgiveashitland and turns out to be a total badass who wins at everything and never loses at anything? That's what No Game No Life is like. Every single time Sora and Shiro play a game, they always win, even if it's a game which is based purely on luck.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, from other shows in this genre, like Death Note or Code Geass, or even Kaiji, we already know that the main character is going to succeed with their mind games, and the fun in that is seeing how the main character wins. But at least in those shows, there is actual dramatic tension. They actually have moments where we think the characters are going to lose, and even if they don't, their actions still have consequences. Even if they win, they lose something in doing so. In NGNL, there is little to no dramatic tension at any point. Even if the audience is reminded of how high the stakes are in the games they play, we already know that the characters are invincible from the get-go and will never have to cut their losses, the only reason for that being Sora and Shiro's catchphrase \"Blank never loses.\" This makes the show completely and utterly boring to watch, because why should I care about whether the characters win or lose if there is no tension because they never lose? Late in the show, they bet the lives of everyone in Elchea, and at that point their victory is a foregone conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters: Sora is your typical cocky-as-fuck and smug-as-shit lead character. Shiro is the generic borderline-emotionless younger sister character with white hair and wants Sora's dick. Stephanie is the retarded-more-often-than-not love interest who is the former princess and wants Sora's dick. Jibril is the kooky yet knowledgeable one, who wants Sora's dick. Do any of those characters sound familiar? If so, that's because they're the exact same fucking characters that you would find in this type of anime. The only difference is that they have little-to-no positive or admirable traits about them to balance out.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5 in particular is a good example of this, consisting of Steph continuously challenging Sora and Shiro and predictably losing. Not only do our heroes make her walk around wearing dog ears and a tail and make her remove her clothes every time she loses out of spite for her having a better social life (and Shiro out of jealousy because Sora made Steph fall in love with him due to the pledges), but Steph is retarded enough to keep challenging them, even though she keeps losing. This makes the show further frustrating to watch, because the characters are so unlikable that I don't want them to win, making episode 9, wherein Sora disappears and Shiro has to find a way to bring him back, the only time where there is actual dramatic tension, unemotional. Why should I be sad about a character disappearing and excited about him reappearing if he is a jackass?\\n\\n\r\nIt also brings me to my next point: the fanservice. I don't mind fanservice that much if it's in small doses, but this show goes way overboard! Disregarding the aforementioned episode 5, the very first shot of Shiro is a panty-shot (keep in mind, she's 11). Every time the characters are falling, or flying around, there's panty-shots. Several times throughout the show, the characters go to the onsen, giving us yet more tasteful fanservice involving a shampoo bottle which sprouts tentacles. The final game in the anime depicts a video game where they have to hunt their opponent across a large city while avoiding enemy catgirls, and of course they use their guns to shoot off their clothes. Not to mention the OVAs, the third one consists of Steph getting tentacle-raped, and I am not even joking. I know this is an ecchi, but even other ecchi shows I've seen don't shove the fanservice in your face as much as this.\\n\\n\r\nEven the excuse I've seen some people make for the fanservice being sarcastic doesn't cover this, the fanservice has about as much purpose here as in post-timeskip Fairy Tail. They say that it's meant to be satirical, to make fun of all the other shows in this genre for having pointless fanservice. So it makes fun of pointless fanservice by having pointless fanservice? That would be like if I made fun of terrorists by blowing up a building: it defeats its own purpose.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the animation, it looks pretty at times, and the show is very colorful. However, it is also too colorful, the color palette is oversaturated with pink, and the show in general uses colors so bright that it causes eyestrain. If you watched this show in the middle of the night with all the lights turned off, you'd probably have a seizure.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think that No Game No Life fails at practically every aspect. There's no problem with a show that doesn't take itself seriously, but there's a difference between that and being so retarded that it becomes a chore to watch. I'd rather watch a bad show that takes itself seriously and ends up being boring than a show that doesn't take itself seriously but fails because of its unfunny humor. Having torticollis was more fun than watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't have a problem or even like any of these aspects, then go ahead and watch it and you'll probably like it. If you're anything like me though, you most likely won't like it. I mean, I watch anime and play video games, but even I can see what masturbatory nonsense this is.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is practically indistinguishable from a crappy self-insert wish fulfillment fanfic, so much so that it would make Dakari King Mykan blush. This could have been an okay show if the characters were actually likable, if there was actual dramatic tension and if there wasn't so much goddamn fanservice. As it is, though, this is the worst anime I've seen in a long-ass time.",

            "content": "Do you ever just have those series that you really want to love, but just can't for various reasons?\r\nWell, No Game No Life, or NGNL for short, is that anime for me.\r\nThe premise starts out interestingly enough, with two genius gamer, hikko-NEET siblings who find themselves transported to an alternate fantasy world where everything is decided by games. There, they are caught up in humanity's struggle for survival, which is mostly based on politics and the relative strengths of the other races, since in the alternate world there is no war or killing. Since Sora and Shiro are already incredibly skilled at games due totheir talents in logical thinking and strategy, they have no trouble playing their way towards being the new rulers of Elkia, the human kingdom, and subsequently challenging the other races with the ultimate goal to defeat Tet, the god of the game world. \\n\\n\r\nI'll admit, with the hype surrounding NGNL along with the bright and colorful poster art, I was really excited for this show. I really love genius characters in anime, and having two of them as protagonists seemed almost too good to be true. Unfortunately, Sora and Shiro didn't quite live up to my expectations. While they both turned out to be Gary Stu/Mary Sue-type characters, the biggest problem was NGNL actually takes itself, and by extension its characters, pretty seriously. Sure, there are numerous comedic moments in the show, but those were always brushed aside whenever the real plot kicked in, making the tone rather inconsistent and the characters wholly unbelievable. Plus, the quasi-incest relationship between Sora and Shiro was uncomfortable at best, and icky at worst. I have no moral issues with the subject of incest itself, but too often in anime and manga it's played off as a joke and for fanservice rather than handled well. But then again, I don't really know if there would have been a better way to portray the siblings' relationship, as NGNL constantly fluctuates from being entirely serious to silly and fanservice-laden.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself felt rather contrived, as it needlessly forces the \"logic\" behind the games down its viewers' throats one minute and has the main duo peeking at another character's panties the next. I don't mind fanservice occasionally, but NGNL's fanservice was neither tasteful nor funny. Sora's attempts at winning the trust of the female characters is usually just thinly-veiled sexual harassment. I know that's kind of the point, but I just didn't find it entertaining. Also, NGNL likes to trick its viewers into thinking that Sora and Shiro winning game after game is the product of intelligence and logic, when in reality most of the explanations they come up with are completely ridiculous and unrealistic. This would be fine if the show was trying to parody the whole \"ALL ACCORDING TO PLAN\" thing a lot of anime incorporate, except for the fact that NGNL also takes this very seriously, as if everything happening is totally plausible. And in my opinion, the contrast between the fanservice-heavy comedy parts and the relatively serious game/politics parts just doesn't really work too well.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few redeeming factors of NGNL is its art style, which is quirky, vivid, and all around nice to look at. The animation and music weren't always top-notch, but at least the bright colors and cute character designs made me ignore some of those faults. The art was definitely also unique, as I haven't seen many anime series with that particular use of lighting and color palette.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that being said, I do have to admit that No Game No Life was fun at times. That is, it's the kind of dumb fun that you would enjoy at 2 AM with your brain turned off. And okay, Shiro was pretty cute. But that doesn't change my overall opinion of the series. I don't hate NGNL, but after reading a lot of other reviews and people's opinions on this show (not to mention the current MAL ratings for this show, holy shit) I just couldn't understand why it's so popular and highly regarded. Maybe for some people the idea of a world where everyone plays games to solve problems is their idea of paradise, or maybe the way the main characters defy logic and reason with their wins really gets people's blood pumping. I really don't know. But as for myself, I can only say that although I had some fun with No Game No Life at some points throughout its 12-episode run, it was ultimately not my cup of tea and had many flaws that detracted from what first seemed like an interesting concept.\\n\\n\r\n[Note:] This review was originally written on my blog, and is technically rated a 6.5/10. I'm pretty generous when it comes to ratings, though.",

            "content": "\"Contender for anime of the season\"\r\n\"No doubt the best series currently airing\"\r\n\"Anime of the year\"\r\n\"Best thing I've ever seen\"\r\n\"11/10, it was okay\" -ign\r\nThis is just a sample of the plethora of praise No Game No Life (NGNL) has garnered as of recent. Undoubtedly loved by many and raised up by fans to no end, calling NGNL hyped would be an understatement. Now this is not necessarily a bad thing, however, whether or not it can live up to the countless 10/10 reviews and its 8.87 rating making it the 16th highest rated anime on MAL is a whole different matter. \r\nEnjoyment-9/10\r\nI'm beginning with the enjoymentof this show because this is without a doubt the most alluring aspect of the show and probably the main cause of the ceaseless acclaim this series continues to earn. And it is for good reason; this show essentially has something for everyone. There are few things that NGNL fails to incorporate into itself and the resulting audience it can pertain to encompass many. With video game and anime references alike, accompanied by what seems like an infinite amount of anime tropes and cliches, it definitely entertains the general audience. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is entertaining almost all the time and for the most part does not bore bar the irrelevant scene every now and then (I'm looking at you random bath scenes). Really if anything, the enjoyment you can get out of this show is absurd and makes the show what it is more than the characters, plot, or the art. However what makes the show a lot less enjoyable is the abundance of ecchi material within it. You are constantly bombarded with fan-service each and every episode and while some say it does not detract from the show, it certainly does even if a little bit. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you like being entertained and want to watch something you really enjoy, this is it. There are very few other anime that can entertain as well as NGNL and if you want to just sit back and relax, turn off your brain for a while, and just have a good time this is all you'll need. No need to read the rest of my review if that's all you want in an anime.  \\n\\n\r\nStory-6/10\\n\r\nIf you want to read a summary of the show, there is a synopsis section so go read that before all the reviewers put it out of a job. \\n\\n\r\nThat aside, the story is somewhat interesting. The world building and overall setting are absolutely well executed and come together very well to create a whole fantasy world that does not seem lacking but is rather quite well developed. The entire world that is presented with the many interactions and conflicts within it are extremely well done and although it is definitely unrealistic in a sense that it is fantasy after all, it is still extremely close to reality. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the actual plot itself, there are very few, if any, plot holes throughout the story and because of this viewers will be able to feel that although it is just a fictional world, it really could exist.  The pacing is almost perfect. It rarely feels rushed (there was only one episode) and so every event is given enough time to occur and watchers thus given enough time to comprehend and follow the story. However the plot does slow down at time to create intermissions between major plot events which intentionally relieves the tension and keeps that light-hearted touch yet at the same time relieves a lot of the tension within the serious parts of NGNL causing the plot to be a lot less serious and weaker.\\n\\n\r\nYet the weakest part of the plot and what makes it so weak is easily its predictability. Although the many puzzles and games make it seem complex or intelligent, it is at the core really just a simple plot that makes it very easily appreciated and enjoyable. The ways in which each problem is solved are at the very least creative and definitely fun to experience but are in no ways complex or mind-blowing. So if the methods to their winning is definitely unpredictable to some extent then what is so predictable? The outcomes. UnfortunatelyIn the end, the aftermath of each conflict is easily anticipated. The plot is essentially just a repeat of finding enemies, challenging them, winning, and becoming friend and this is what makes NGNL so much weaker in this regard. The one thing they utilize very well though is cliffhangers. The sheer amount of cliffhangers is absurd and most episodes to end off with one leaving you craving for the next. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough many will claim that the story is a masterpiece, there is very little that is deeper within it. A good story contains underlying themes which the story then pushes to convey to the audience and incite change or at the very least discussion and conflicting ideas. Thankfully NGNL does contain an argument but unfortunately it is the execution of them which is off the mark. Whereas good writing would establish its themes early on and continually build upon the themes subtly through imagery and symbolism as the story progressed, NGNL ignores its themes and is void of them for the majority of itself only to suddenly remember that it had a message to present and then suddenly shoving the theme at you near the end in hopes that you would have caught on to them. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely though, it really is difficult to take the plot seriously because of just how plain silly it is and that in itself is not a bad thing but with all the fans of the show raving on about how great and genius the story is, it will no doubt leave you disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9/10\\n\r\nThe animation style used by Madhouse in NGNL is unique or at the very least uncommon. It has a bright and vibrant colour palette that is very nice to look at and because of how separated the colours are from reality, it compliments the fantasy world they live in and only makes it more beautiful. The gags pulled in the show and references made to other media is also very well expressed and their ability to switch from style to style makes each reference so much more fluid and recognizable. The colours are a little bit tiring on the eyes however as a result of all the bright colours (think a bunch of neon signs). \\n\\n\r\nSound-6/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good; memorable voices that express the personalities and emotions that express the characters well. The music is lacking however and unfortunately is unmemorable (I literally cannot remember if there was any to begin with). It's definitely not bad enough so that it subtracts from the show, but neither is it good enough that it makes it any better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-4/10\\n\r\nPeople seem to believe that the characters in this show are somehow amazing and unique yet how is that possible when each and every character in the show are built upon popular anime tropes. You have everything in this show from NEETs to tsunderes, to animal girls, demons/angels, and even elves. The characters are likable, that's for sure. After all, with such a wide variety of overdone characters, how could you not like one of them. But what makes the characters the weakest is not their lack of originality. Rather it is the lack of proper development for most of the characters. Perhaps this is a result of the show only being 12 episodes long, but any form of development within the main characters is completely absent. They can probably be described best as super computers with personalities. Although they have traits that take them outside of the regular character molds, any type of change in personality or even ability is absent throughout the series. They start as geniuses and end as geniuses and that's all they are. You learn little about their past and see no changes in their character whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have the supporting characters. Fortunately these characters have development over the course of the show but it isn't enough. As each conflict begins with finding an enemy and then beating and befriending them, every supporting character that joins the main cast as the show progresses actually changes but as soon as they do, the plot moves onto the next order of business and their development is put aside for these new \"villains\" to appear. Hence the only characters with advancement in the entirety of the show are those few supporting characters present from the very beginning. Regrettably even those characters are set aside continuously and then made to serve as either eye-candy or comedic relief for episodes on end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters are for the most part flat and two-dimensional. Who they are can be taken at face value because the characters of NGNL undoubtedly have only one layer to them. They never stray from what they establish themselves as when they are introduced, never showing any signs of actually being complex characters but rather show how simple and one-sided they all are. As beautiful as those one sides are and as entertaining as they can be they are in the end still one sided and become repetitive before long.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-6.5/10\\n\r\nDoes NGNL live up to the hype? Definitely not. Certainly the enjoyment of the show there and it has a wide audience with simple plots and characters that aid in how easily people can appreciate it, but the enjoyment of the show seems to have caused a bias in which those weak characters and predictable plot are all but ignored in favour of its entertainment value. All in all it is a good show overall; definitely above your average fantasy show but not as much as people make it out to be. It is far from the masterpiece people like to think it is. I'll admit, the mood of the show and its overall fun feeling makes it very easy to forget about its flaws but in the end those flaws are still there and should not be overlooked. The plot is far from serious and is nowhere close to being as complex or stunning as people make it out to be and although the characters may be lovable and are all fun to watch, they are at the same time flat and unfinished, leading you to become bored of them at times. If you're looking to be entertained and have fun watching a show, this is it, but don't go in expecting anything deep or intelectual.   \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: BEST SHOW OF 2014!

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nIf Death Note and Code Geass have taught us anything, it is that there is something intoxicating about protagonists who are too smart for their own good. There is an undeniable and indescribable appeal to watching someone psychologically destroy all opponents in their path regardless of how questionable the logic they use to do so truly is. However, unlike its two predecessors, No Game No Life is not a show that demands to be taken seriously. It is light-hearted, comedic, and fun as opposed serious, dark, and intense. This approach, in theory, is a much better way to tackle the \u201csuper-smart\u201d protagonist conceptbecause it avoids any possibility that the show comes off as pretentious or overly-serious, which were big knocks DN and CG. For this reason, I was very excited for what has become the most hyped anime of the season, and while I found certainly found it to be entertaining, it has a large number flaws that prevent it from living up to the unreasonable hype that the fan base has created for it. It does many things well, but for every thing that it does well, there is something it does poorly.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Two siblings named Sora and Shiro are brilliant NEET, hikikomori gamers who have become legends on the Internet due to how good they are at playing video games under the codename \u201cBlank\u201d. One day, they are summoned by an androgynous being named Tet to an alternate world. Tet, who claims to be God of this world, has prohibited war and declared this to be a world where everything is decided by games, and I mean literally everything. In this world, humanity is only one of 14 other races, all vying for world domination though the act of challenging each other to games. Sora and Shiro, excited by the concept of the world, set off on an epic journey to see just how far their gaming abilities can take them.\\n\\n\r\nThe appeal of No Game No Life comes in the form of how fleshed out and imaginative the setting is, but it is the depth of the world that ultimately also creates significant flaws in it. To elaborate, the plot of this anime can easily be described as tedious; there is SO much explaining that needs to be done. There are 14 different races, some of them can use magic and some of them can\u2019t, they all have a designated \u201crank\u201d, they play games with each other to decide everything, they can\u2019t murder or cause physical harm to one another, what constitutes a game needs to be specified, the games must follow 10 rules, those rules are called the pledges, some of the pledges have loopholes, some of them don\u2019t, also there\u2019s (*MIND EXPLODES). Top all of this exposition off with the fact that each individual game played in the series has its own unique set of rules that you need to remember and the logic that Sora and Shiro use to win the games they play also needs explaining and what you have is one massive information overload. It is 100% impossible to coherently follow everything that is happening in this series, and that is a fact that has both pros and cons. The cons are obviously the fact that the oversaturation of explanations make the show feel hectic and chaotic at times, but on the pro side, they make the show a lot of fun. Watching Blank massacre their opponent\u2019s using ridiculously unreasonable logic never gets old, and while there are many words to describe the games played in NGNL, \u201cboring\u201d is not one of them. I applaud the show for establishing key plot points and never seeming to lack direction; this is a show that knows exactly what it wants to be in terms of tone and themes, but I\u2019m not a very big fan of the themes they chose to include. At times, the show feels like it is nothing more then shameless otaku pandering and fanservice filler. I cringed as the show used one contrived plot device after another in order to incorporate as many anime fetishes as it possibly could and took every chance it got to throw in a pop-culture reference. The fanservice is also gratuitous, albeit mostly harmless considering the type of show we are dealing with. Overall, NGNL\u2019s plot can best be described as mindless fun. That may sound weird for a show that is grounded on the concept of logic, but it is the simple reality. The series can be flawed and stupid times, but it\u2019s effective.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of NGNL are fun, but horribly unrealistic. Our protagonists, Sora and Shiro, are too overpowered and not good representations of socially inept NEETs. Drawing comparisons to why I am not a big fan of most shounens, the MCs are obviously protected by plot armor and that takes away from the suspense of the plot; they are simply too perfect. To be fair though, the show does a good job of giving Sora a personality and making him entertaining, but he is a mary-sue. How are these protagonists supposed to be anti-social? If anything, they are charismatic! Sure they have a 10 second comedic panic attack every now and again, but the show does a very poor job of representing what their characters are supposed to be. Shiro, for example, did not impress me at all; her only real traits are that she\u2019s cute and unreasonably smart, so again: mary-sue. She can be funny with her bluntness every now and then, but her entire presence just feels unnecessary; it\u2019s like they wrote this show with Sora as the only protagonist and then the editors added in Shiro to provide loli appeal. The side characters are nothing spectacular either; the only one that I think was well done is Steph because she successfully provided two things that are instrumental to the show\u2019s tone and themes, those being comedic relief and fanservice. Then you have characters like Jibril who are just awful and unbelievably one-dimensional. Jibril is a walking plot-device in every sense of the word; she serves no purpose other than to advance the storyline with her seemingly unrestricted magical powers. Oh, and she also provides fanservice (shockingly). The strange thing is that even though the NGNL characters aren\u2019t all that special, they work decently well. The reason for this phenomenon is that they have good chemistry with one another; you can really sense that Sora and Shiro legitimately care for one another and the show is filled with funny interactions between Blank and the side characters, especially Steph. So in short: the cast of NGNL is far from perfect, but they turned out all right.\\n\\n\r\nDoes NGNL live up to the hype? No, not at all actually, especially considering the fact that this show has been hyped to the point where it is dubbed as a masterpiece for the ages that will be talked about for decades. It\u2019s still a solid anime, but I can\u2019t fathom why this show has become so beloved. It\u2019s funny, over-the-top, way too convoluted, yet fun: nothing special. It\u2019s probably worth a watch provided that you disregard the hype train and go in with reasonable expectations.\\n\r\nAschente!",

            "content": "Does this show have any sense of tension? Hell no. Curveball plot-twists? Not any that aren't made meaningless in a near instant. Well written or developed characters? Not on your fucking life. So why the hell am I not flat out panning No Game No Life? The answer: It was a wild ride.\r\nI would be lying if I said this show had anything resembling good writing in regards to story, characters, or humor (which is 90% anime/manga references anyhow). What it does have is a premise that gives everyone and their grandma in the universe the license to go full ham. A world where everythingis decided by games, even criminal acts such as mugging, lends itself well to the spirit of, God help me for being so casual, \"fun\". The reason to watch is to see just how inane and stupid shit can get, and boy howdy, it doesn't disappoint in keeping an audience entertained. Chess turning into a real-time strategy game? Shiritori: Batshit Insane Version? Sign me up!\\n\\n\r\nTragically, NGNL does have its shortcomings, mostly character related. Sora and Shiro might as well be renamed Gary Stu and Mary Sue with how infallible they are despite their agoraphobia and separation anxieties. There's a difference between having a knack for something and being omnipotent, and they blaze off passing the latter as they vanish into the sunset. While Yami Yugi from the original Yu-Gi-oh! manga also had a very few number of losses to his name, the games were more dangerous, giving them more suspense despite the outcome being obvious. Meanwhile, at the end of every single big match played that MIGHT have looked close, the strat explanations of the Perfect Duo could be best summed up as \"Close? Hell naw I will tell you all 108 reasons why this was actually a curbstomp\". This is ESPECIALLY bad in the shiritori game where they in a mere 20 minutes managed to reinvert the metagame of a word association game. Jibril is not someone who is too terribly interesting on her own, but possible stories of her past in the later seasons (trust me, there will be since this averaged 9K+ sales and even breaking the Manabi Line is like Christmas for Madhouse) may prove for some interesting world-building. For the time being, Steph's purposes including acting as a punching bag first and a plot device second. I guess the big problem with the cast is that their personalities are, in a word, lacking, and you remember them for their gimmicks than any innate traits that aren't linked to a gag or a steadfast maintaining of status quo.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the gags are of the aforementioned sandbagging of Steph, and references to anime, manga, and video games, ranging from JoJo to Yu-Gi-Oh! to Hyouka to Phoenix Wright along with many more. However, they are hit or miss, with the Castle in the Sky reference being the crowning jewel. Aside from that, the rest are pervy jokes with occasional metahumor. Visually, this anime has more bloom than a 7th+ gen FPS title, which is a tragedy as Madhouse is on the high-end when it comes to visually appealing anime. It flattens out everything on the screen, making nothing pop out at you or leave a lasting impression. It's almost a sin to have so much of the background details hidden and drowned out behind an abundance of effects and filters.\\n\\n\r\nOne's ability to enjoy the series hinges ENTIRELY on how much they can put up with characters that wear 50 suits of plot armor before going to bed at night. If wish-fulfillment characters with flaws that fail to attempt to balance them out is enough for you to make you drop a series in an episode or two, stay the hell away from No Game No Life. If you are willing to put up with the asspulls for the concept, sit back, relax, and have fun.",

            "content": "No Game No Life, which ended a short time ago as of this writing, is at its heart a polarizing anime.  It's not that it has really controversial content, or that it breaks a lot of new ground that is hard for people to stomach, but rather that this show is quite simple when it comes down to it.  On the upside, it has a refreshing spin to a rather trite formula, but on the other side, there are flaws you cannot ignore in this anime.  It is an enjoyable ride, however, if you can look past this.\r\nThe basic premise of NGNLas it's commonly referred to by fans, is that the main characters, Sora and Shiro, are an unstoppable force in the gaming community in real life.  At the beginning of the anime they are teleported to a world where games are literally cosmic rules, where winning or losing a game can determine the fate of your soul, or whatever thing you bet.  It is quite thorough so far in exploring the rules that this world operates in, as well as every conceivable way in and around those rules, especially by the many races that inhabit it, who all have some form of 'cheat' or magic or special ability that gives them an edge over Imanity, humanity's stand-in.\\n\\n\r\nThe aforementioned setup is without a doubt the biggest strength of NGNL.  It explores this setting with a 'monster of the week' formula, that, with interesting spins on the situation reminiscent of the stronger entries in the shounen genre, doesn't really disappoint at any part.  It sets up these situations well, and paces them throughout the anime with an appropriate degree of aplomb, proving for a really smooth ride for viewing.  This anime is easy to watch and doesn't go an episode without giving the viewer something new and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point is that it is quite well-animated.  I cannot comment for its adaptation of the light novels art, as I have not read the light novel, but in either case, it fills in all the gaps nicely.  The animation has a colorful tint, as well as a lot of rather unique and eye-catching character designs.  Most aspects of this anime are pleasing on the eye, and far from being a lip-flapping exercise, as some anime with a knack for mind-games might turn out to be when animated at their worst, there's a lot going on, and it's all animated pretty fluidly to my eye.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say that it does not misstep however, it just doesn't so in the manner that many anime fall prey to.  As a counter to the interesting and varied setups I mentioned earlier, a lot of the characters feel rather...dull.  This can't really be attributed to bad character design in any way, in fact, there's a rather diverse cast of characters, but rather, it is that most of them fit into a mold seen before, and done better before.  That isn't to say there is no room for development, you do get a glimpse into what might be for some of these characters, whose motivations are viewed briefly, but they aren't really tested for the most part, and there's a lot of one-bit villains, apart from one human the main characters face early on.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the main characters are, I'm going to say this frankly, Mary Sues.  For those unfamiliar with the term, a Mary Sue is a character who is overly perfect.  There are a lot of different types, but the essential nature of all of them comes down to their unbelievability as a character.  Sora and Shiro are pretty much unbeatable, showing a level of planning that verges on omniscient.  This isn't entirely bad in of itself.  The antagonists' reactions to 'Blank' (Their pseudonym) completely predicting every one of their moves, can be entertaining, but it does rob the show of a good deal of conflict.  There are a couple token attempts to create some tension, but on the whole, they fail to really hit the mark, and you never think that the pair will ever really fail, and that's the biggest mark this show has against it.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, however, I will say this.  There may be room for this to get better, and I am tentatively anticipating that.  As this is based on an ongoing Light Novel series, there is room for more development, especially since this seems to be the authors first work, according to this site.  On its own though, NGNL is riddled with a few problems, but an entertaining ride throughout, and I still highly recommended it, just on the aspect that it is unique, and it has plenty of places to go.",

            "content": "You know people tend to say that first impression is everything. One of the first things No Game No Life throws at you is a detailed panty shot of an eleven year old girl. Still I am a reasonable man. After all more than on one occasion a show made a bad impression but got a lot better afterwords...sadly No Game No Life does not.\r\nThe plot follows duo of brother and sister who are sucked into a world where everything is decided by games. Both wars and killing are banned. The only way to move up the social ledder and ETC is being good atgames. \\n\\n\r\nI have a lot of problems with this anime. While the concept is pretty good the execution is downright horrible. First of all the show lets us know that both protagonists are virtually unbeatable at ANY GAME, succesfully killing any kind of tension for the said games which are basicly the main attarction of the show. Both protagonist are not just good at games, they are parcticly good at almost EVERYTHING. They read emotions, great at manipulating people through dialoge, smart and by that I mean not just game smart, but borderline ridicilously overpowered smart. Forgive me but I have a hard time that an 18 year old virgin who has not friends and plays only games and a girl who does not even leave home posses such skills. \\n\\n\r\nBut that is just the start of the problems. The second main character is Stephie Dola, a girl who's sole purpous is to be dumb and make main character look good. I am not kidding when I say she is dumb. She is like on a level of an average 14 year old girl in smarts departament. Now a point of such characters is often to pass the exposition to a viewer through said character. In this show the protagonists spend a LOT of time expalining most basic things to her which brings down the pacing a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing itself is utterly broken. At the start it is faster than a speeding bullet with characters not even reacting to getting inside a whole new world. There is niether negative nor positive reaction. Then when the actuall games start the pacing drops to really slow and let me explain why.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows main attraction as I said before is the games and \"Smart\" tactics used by the characters and ETC. The things is the tactics and twists they use in the show are so obvious that it gets extra boring when they are explaining and implementing the twists when I saw them coming 5 minutes before they were used. \\n\\n\r\nSome may say that the pacing issues are coming from the show being given only 12 episodes. Well I say the pacing would be a lot better if they did not spent more time on fanservice than on the ACTUALL GAMES!\\n\\n\r\nThe whole show came off as expremely pretentious. It thinks that it is really smart and thinks outside the box, when in reality it is obvious and very rarely does something surprising. The whole show spents way too much time trying to convince you that the protaginsts are the greatest, smartest, most awesome creatures ever, while in reality they are just overpowered wishfullfilment badly written characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in the show is downright awful. I never once smiled. Though I have to give credit to voice actors who do their best to make the script sound funny.\\n\\n\r\nI have a few positive things to say too overall. The visuals are good even if they filters they use get in the way a little. Still very nice to look at. The soundtrack is really really good and captures the video game feel very well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I could barely get through 5 episodes and it felt like an eternity of fanservice, wishfullfilment and bad writing. I know that a lot of people like this show but I was not one of them.\\n\\n\r\nAlso a bath scene with 11 year old girl...",

            "content": "Following the adventures of two genius gamers in a fantasy world where everything is decided by games? That sounds interesting, but unfortunately, it's not as good as it could seem.\r\nStory:\r\nThe main focus of the story is obviously the games played by Sora and Shiro, our main characters, to come closer to their objective. And while it seems interesting at first, it quickly becomes clear that they will all be solved in a similar way, which is without much logic at all. As the protagonists will state several times, they win as soon as the game starts, because they are that good. So, what happens duringthe game doesn't really matter. There is no real tension, because even if it seems like Sora and Shiro could lose, you know they won't. You know that after some time, they will pull out of nowhere an explanation of why they had won since the beggining and why their opponent is stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe time between the different games is spent on discussing the politics of the world and the tactics that should be used to conquer it, which is in fact not bad. It would be even better, though, if it wasn't punctuated by awfully long and frequent bath scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWe officially have two protagonists, but it's not long before we figure out that one of them is a main character in name only.\\n\\n\r\nSora, our first main character, is extremely arrogant and always trying to show how much better he is than any other character. Indeed, he is very smart and good at bluffing, and his attitude could probably be understood if those two qualities weren't the only one he possessed. Instead, this permanent tendency to show off for no good reason makes Sora a very unlikable character. But we haven't talked yet about what could be Sora's most important trait: his inability to make a mistake. Everything Sora says is true and if someone thinks otherwise, they'll be proven wrong sooner or later. If Sora seems to be loosing, it's only an illusion, because he always wins. Convenient, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe other main character is Shiro, Sora's younger sister, who handles the more mathematical sides of their games. Or at least, once in a while, to remember the audience she's supposed to be the main character alongside her brother. Most of the time, Shiro is actullay just there for the loli fanservice and to show her unbreakable love towards Sora, without doing anything of much importance.\\n\\n\r\nGravitating around our two protagonists, are various female characters who are either forgettable or annoying. Indeed, my favourite character is actually Stephanie, which is saying something since the poor girl's only purpose is to look stupid in comparison to Sora and Shiro and, of course, to be used for fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals:\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the visual aspect of the show, the first thing that catches the attention is the colour palette that has been used. Primarly composed of blue, pink and purple, it really brings out the feeling of being in an other world and creates a dream-like atmosphere. The are times, however, when I felt like it was just too bright to still be pretty, so while I think using those colours was a very good idea, slightly toning them down might have made everything a bit more agreeable to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest, some sceneries were really pretty, and the animation and art were generally fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending were very good, as was the voice acting. The ost was fine, but not particularly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed No Game No Life, to a certain extent. If you try to forget about the lack of logic in the winning of the games and simply focus on the immediate action, trying to immerse yourself in it, you will probably find this anime extremely entertaining, like it seem many people do. But as soon as you stop caring about what happens, and just sit there contemplating Sora's arrogance and Shiro's lack of emotion, waiting for the explanation of how they won their game to come out of nowhere, you will get bored.",

            "content": "Flourishing aesthetics come a long way in holding a show up from just being average or forgettable. Sometimes loving a show just for its high energetic personality can be a blessing and a curse. Then again, it all comes down to the show\u2019s purposeful existence to help distinguish how it should be viewed. Whether it wants to be a fun and stupid show with the only intention of being provocative, or a thought-provoking show with a deep narrative. Now that shouldn\u2019t be said to excuse it fully on the numerous faults it might have, but with a show like No Game No Life, it isone of the instances where you can\u2019t help but admire its silliness.\\n\\n\r\nWith that all said, No Game No Life is not what you would call a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d as many would love to build this up to be. While entertainment factor definitely pulls through the most out of any experience from it, it cannot be forgiven for how low-quality it tries to implement a story. That in turn comes from the fact that there\u2019s not much of a story to digest in No Game No Life. It is literally just a plot that follows two NEET MMO players that are thrown into a virtual reality where they just play games in order to become rulers of this virtual world. There is hardly any suspenseful pull you have in getting invigorated in it because it is insanely predictable in every game outcome. I know from the beginning that Sora and Shiro are going to win all the way through, so why should I be invigorated in it to begin with?\\n\\n\r\nIt is a real shame that it does not bother to create a cohesive narrative to follow from point A to point B. Especially with the amount of creativity it brings to the overall cast. Granted they are not, what I would call, \u201cmagnificent\u201d in development, but what makes up for it is their big energy and charm. This all comes from their witty dialogue and fantastic designs that have really unique styles to whatever emotion they are portraying. It would be easier to dissect the main cast individually because it will put my argument into context into my feelings of them.\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonists Sora and Shiro are inseparable siblings who the writers are obviously pulling the brother and sister relationship card on. I will argue that, by themselves, they are extremely bland and atypical in their archetypes. When they are together, however, they are quite an entertaining duo thanks to their chemistry and hilarious interludes between one another. It helps more on Sora\u2019s side that he does pack in great charisma thanks in part to Yoshitsugu Matsuoka\u2019s fabulous voice acting. Shiro, on the other hand, has Ai Kayano on her side who is essentially just playing her as Shiina 2.0; nothing special in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nThen we get to Stephanie Dora and it may be controversial to say this, but she is by far the most entertaining of the cast. The main reason being from Yoko Hikasa\u2019s voice acting, who is having such a freaking ball with voicing for this character. Her great ability of showing great dignity to her voice and all of the sudden become a raving maniac in the next second just shows her talent in full throttle. A lot of people may have the point in criticizing Steph for being both an intelligent girl and a stupid one in other scenarios. My response would be how No Game No Life has so many silly elements to its comedy that it fits perfectly to the tone. This makes her archetype more forgiving since we often see female characters of this magnitude several times but because of these two great qualities, it makes her all the more lovable. Also she dresses up as a puppy and we get to hear Yoko Hikasa bark like one, need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nFinally there is Jibril, who was hard to get into at first glance. But once she went on and more funny moments came along, she lately became on-par with Steph in terms of entertaining qualities. This is Yukari Tamura at her best, largely because we don\u2019t ever get to see her voice females with perverted personalities. When she does, she is just heavenly every time. What also eventually led me to liking her more was how she seemed to possess the same fun qualities that Steph had in personality shifts from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does standout for No Game No Life\u2019s credit to make it more interesting than most shows of its caliber is its art and animation. The extreme usage of over-saturated colors give it its look from original creator and character designer, Yuu Kamiya. His name under the cast and crew had me hesitant at first, seeing he was also involved with Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi, which is one of my most hated shows. Luckily this was not anything of that level of awful and the artwork definitely stood on its own. However, it could\u2019ve worked better if the color palette was emphasized a little less and made it more consistent for a better viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nNow, do you like fun entertainment as much as I do? If yes, then No Game No Life is one show that seems to only care about being a fun show from beginning to end. Is it perfect in being able to bring forth these fun moments on full display? Not necessarily, but if anything, No Game No Life is at that level of entertainment to where it can be respectable in giving forth good effort. It manages to incorporate fun action sequences with flashy animation and also delivers incredibly hysterical comedy in one package. Not many anime can achieve the difficulty of balancing both aspects to great effect, to which No Game No Life accomplishes this feat. Though the action and games can be predictable as to who\u2019ll win in the long run, the journey is at least fun for the ride.\\n\\n\r\nWith the advent of VRMMO anime being at full force at the moment, it is likely we won\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel for this phase in anime history. The popularity of No Game No Life clearly shows this. While its qualities do not really come in-par with the impact it apparently has, it is by no means bad by its very nature. Once you can find some great substance in entertainment, that in-of-itself justifies it as being good entertainment. If it comes to showing off these same instances of cliches without any substance in the future, then I would be greatly worried.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B\\n",

            "content": "No Game No Life Review:\r\nMindset:\r\nMade by the  studio Mad House and watched with no expectations  except that it is definite that the original manga was made in Brazil.     \r\nSynopsis:\r\nTwo fabled NEET sibling gamers get conveyed in a fantasy realm when all what you do is play games then soon purchasing the bed for Your Harem and triumph everything as a crazy empowerment fantasy never to be taken a tad  seriously with convuleted strategies that is potentially metalogic by the intelect of the human psyche  but proviedes a smirk- consequently making you  hallucinate fluffy rainbows- consequentlymaking you feel like its the epic journey of life.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nIndeed it is a necessity to notify that you do not watch this show for the story, it tries to convince you to think deeply but the reality is that the show is mostly dependant on woeful moments. And I might as well state that  is the best show that made itself as a pure empowerment fantasy pandering over the Otaku audience because it got a majority of corrections. It was much more self-aware, the characters (as how much I want to bash them) served there purpose for there entertainment value. The story however; is to be described  bluntly, was to move along everything and it is the  entertainment variable  which has transformed as the driving factor, not the plot! Which is not disappointing, on the other hand it really gives you the feeling that the world DisBoard is actually magical, majestic, golden and it makes you think that you just ate the burnt tobacco leaves  mixed with purple shrooms and whisky, the Animation is the best I've seen from mad house (personally I find it better  than wolf children) being definitly above average, oh how much You and I will love the extra effort by giving it a large range of colours making you love magical LSD.  The fanservice is rahter extreme and some scenes are sitting next to the border line, You have clothes completely oblidarted, plot devices for female cosplay or even taking advantage by the laws of Disboard to show feisty fetishes. If You are not into that, then be prepared to be lashed out.\\n\\n\r\n The characters were fairly well done overall as how much as I want to bash the archetypes, it seemed fittting for Sora's conquest  to also increase the population density  of he's Harem and in the critical eye it seemed to be a tad more tolerable, but archetypes, are still archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is how we should split the cake, everything to the sound, animation, (okay maybe not the sound)  but the overall narrative and presence of the show reflects towards the fact that this show is not for everyone! Its pandering purely over  the Otaku demographic as the whole thing seemed like an Otaku's fantasy realm and it was there to be a destination when one seeks out the deviating and guilty pleasure piece of fiction. For those who are not too much into anime and would rather hunt down  for plot and characterization then it all boils down into a bad show. Either You call this  \u201cThe best thing next to Shrek\u201d Or \u201cA piece of nude rubbish\u201d\\n\\n\r\nReplicated towards the reflection of the characters, they can become rather likeable at a short  time span because of there silliness despite being archetypes and are not at all deep and four dimensional and are idealized by the Otaku mind thus making them undefeated. They are goofy at almost everything else but when playing a game there on Godmode, they do not develop and change through out the duration while simultaneously staying virgin. Nothing is \u201cEver\u201d  to be taken seriously at any specs of the imagination. In the world of Disboard, everything thrives by Idealism and Imagination, doing the impossible without difficulty and not being able to wash the dishes in our mundane  reality.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nIt's dum entertainment, erotic, overall very idealistic and delusional. Only stated and viewed as \u201cMagical\u201d by again; your local Otaku and intentionally  not targeting the minds of  those who watch too much Disney and Pixar. And I suppose you could like it if your eyes on fan service has reduced into saying that this is the new rule of cool.\\n\\n\r\nCRITICAL SCORE:\\n\r\n6/10 \u2013 Epic-ish story of Otaku fantasy\\n\r\n6/10 \u2013 Archetypes used well to further emphasise the escapism\\n\r\n7.5/10 \u2013 LSD visual animation, further immerses You into another world.\\n\r\n7/10 \u2013 Orchestras FTW.\\n",

            "content": "The most well known tenant of psychology is that human are tremendously social creatures. The most powerful motivation to see an anime is that you're friends and all the people in MaL are seeing it. Consequently, word-of-mouth is the most important marketing tool. There is no question that for this season NGNL was the most talked about anime of 2014 thus far. It was more than a show. It was an event that could not be missed. A second tenant of psychology is that viewers want to relate to the protagonists situation and see him 'suddenly change/succed'. Sora (the protagonist of the show) is depictedas honorable, independent, moral, selfless, sensitive ~ positive traits that appeal to audiences. Also he is uneducated, socially anxious, burdened and a NEET. Wait, what?? Where did this traits come from? I'l tell you. These traits came orientated towards the second tenant I mentioned. From the description of MaL any Grade 6 can articulate the fact that this show transforms a NEET into a hero. It provides an 'escapism' to the users telling them in any hole you are in whether your a NEET, beta or alpha, there will be a place where you can expose your untapped potential (granted this place doesn't exist). \\n\\n\r\nA true \"underdog\" story. \\n\\n\r\nThis review is directed towards anyone who is planning or considering on watching Madhouses' new production 'No Game No Life' AND WHO HAVE READ THE SYNOPSIS. (I capped it because it is crucial for this review) I won't include spoilers or leak plot lines, nor make it my personal mission to convince you to/not to watch this show.This is a completely unbiased neutral review. \\n\\n\r\nTake a second and press Ctrl-T and head over to Google. Press images and type in \"No Game No Life.\" What do you see from those neon over-saturated pictures? You see the hype everyone is talking about. Do you know what I see. Pictures resembling other pictures of anime that are ranked from 1000-5000 on this site. So why is this anime #19? Let me answer this. It certainly isn't the background art that took 30 minutes to make for the first 3 episodes, it isn't the soundtrack that splintercell or Origa isn't making. \\n\\n\r\nIt's what I call U~\u014drusutor\u012bto' [\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8]. When you take an underdog and grant him the ability to to the impossible. No Game No Life works on the two tenants I mentioned with an added element. It surprises the audience by the sheer intelligence/gambling the protagonist makes. NGNL involves a protagonist who bets large objects, and when shit hits the fan and he is about to lose a suddent element is added that makes him win. \\n\\n\\n\r\n//Formula Program for No Game No Life\\n\\n\r\n#include \\n\r\n#include  //deprecated.

This would\u2019ve made for interesting character development except it never has any bearing on the plot. There\u2019s no growth or change from being a NEET or hikikomori. It\u2019s just tacked on as a shallow way to relate to its audience.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also too much fan service. The other characters aren\u2019t much more than wish fulfillment and are there to look good. Except there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with fan service. The issue here is that it\u2019s taking the place of genuinely good story telling and character development. If the characters had more depth I wouldn\u2019t have minded.\\n\\n\r\nLook, I get it. You can make really interesting, unique works, but it\u2019s risky. Or you can make something with proven appeal and pulls in revenue. Anime is already a struggling industry where only the hardcore fans (otaku) command the market with their money. It\u2019s capitalism, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. So I have hard time faulting No Game No Life for pandering. It\u2019s a struggle between letting the work stand on its own and taking into account external factors like the consumer market.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I do have issue with is people overrating it. The fun of the show comes from the main characters solving what seems to be impossible challenges. In their fantasy world, humans are the lowest ranked civilization. This was a good choice, but each episode\u2019s puzzle or conflict isn\u2019t solved in a satisfying way. It only SEEMS clever, and the way it\u2019s solved isn\u2019t natural. It felt like the writer worked backwards instead of building off progressively harder obstacles.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the same issue I had with the TV show House M.D. There\u2019s a medical mystery, the show spends an hour dancing around it, House has an epiphany, and it\u2019s solved. The medical issue is solved when the writers say it\u2019s solved. The show is still fun, though, and House is a great character.\\n\\n\r\nI do love the premise as it invites stories around tactics and strategy instead of who has more chakra or the higher power level. The art is vibrant and colorful. Everything has a dreamy glow to it. Even with all my issues with it, the show was still entertaining, and I don\u2019t regret finishing it.",

            "content": "Welcome to No Game No Life! Where violence is forbidden and you play games with others to decide simple wagers from your pet dog or your crappy bagged lunch to bigger prizes like your life and perhaps the future of humanity! \r\nWith a premise like that, it's no wonder why NGNL attracted so many viewers in the 2014 anime year and it truly does not disappoint. With elements of action, ecchi, superb art, brain power, and amazing amounts of lolis. NGNL is one of the shining points of the 2014 crop and I recommend it to those who enjoy a straightforward story of gamers enteringa world that is not freaking Sword Art Online. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9, An outstanding story line is presented with a strong parallel to Kamiya's  manga adaption. Vivid descriptions of plot and underlying meanings behind all of Sora and Shiro's actions make the series even more enticing. Every character, every motion, every decision has a purpose behind it and a viewer can understand with confidence that an action isn't done just for the screentime but rather for a designated reason. The setting is novel and the premise is simply unlike any other animes which gives the viewer a brand new look and viewpoint.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10, I'm a big fan of art in anime and many of the highly ranked 2014 animes and even modern animes have adapted to stunning visuals and breathtaking imagery. Details of characters, to background scenes, to even the art on some of the mini games that the MC's play is accentuated to a surprisingly minute detail. Unfortunately, sometimes anime producers will slack on the plot and try to make up for it in the artwork category but this is not the case in NGNL. By coupling art along with a strong story, both categories held to point and a great series is made even greater. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8, While interesting in plot and art, sound lacked the extra OOMPH that I would've liked. Sad themes and happier melodies were not brought out in key moments and overall music was stagnant at times. That being said, music was not an overall failure, the OP and ED for NGNL are fantastic and the OP in and of itself is a piano masterpiece that I am still struggling to play today. (seriously though, that piece is hard man ^_^)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8, Character development is hard to do in 12 episodes and it was somewhat evident in NGNL. While most people won't complain about surface characterizations and ulterior motives, it would have been nice to know about Steph's background and the other races rather than dive right into the action immediately with very little prior description. With this in mind, it is not as if characters were simply skimmed over. We are given in depth looks at their relationships and especially the strong bond between Shiro and Sora throughout multiple events that test their connection as a family. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10, hilarious lines like your a \"steph\"(play on steph's stupidity compared to super-geniuses Sora/Shiro) and Sora's fixation to panties of all kinds make this series exciting and lighthearted when it needs to be. Although I find myself a fan of romance genre, I do like to dip my toes into other genres as well to get the full anime experience. NGNL had a lot of fan-service featuring questionably aged characters but nothing much different than some of the other ecchi animes out there. My only regret was that the season was so short and I hope that there is another one coming out this year or next!\\n\\n\r\nThrow a brotha a like! And game on.",

            "content": "What if Outbreak Company and Code Geass had a baby? \r\nThat would actually be quite horrible. \r\nBut No Game No Life (NGNL) presents itself in such a way that it appears to be just that - a combination of the fantasy world that presents a large array of new discoveries in Outbreak Company with the completely spine-shivering tactics and seemingly impossible goals in Code Geass; however, NGNL manages to not only provide an interesting combination, but also add its own flavors to the mix and concoct something truly engaging. \r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story and premise of NGNL is quite the bait in of itself which -much like Sword Art Online - plays a huge role in its explosive success and popularity. The story thrusts the NEET protagonists, Sora and Shiro, into a new world that makes use of their extreme talent in games since quite literally everything is determined by the outcome of a variety of games the world's inhabitants play. This setting is quite refreshing since many anime simply throw NEET protagonists into the video game world (or something of a similar nature) they have been obsessing over, such as Sword Art Online, Log Horizon, Btooom!, and Accel World. NGNL could have easily taken that route, especially with the protagonists' insane MMORPG skills demonstrated at the beginning; yet NGNL decided to make an entire new world that wasn't restricted by MMORPG parameters, but rather by a set of 10 laws that a \"God\" has created. The other races of the world also present an interesting aspect to the show, emphasizing that all other races appear to be superior in their own way with the exception of Imanity (the world's version of humanity) in regards of playing games. Instead of each race presenting similar challenges to the protagonists, the races throw a variety of difficult obstacles at Shiro and Sora since each race will base the game they play on one that is well-suited to their race's unique abilities. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, NGNL was being able to maintain its long, over-arching story of Shiro and Sora trying to beat the God of the world that put them there in the first place, not getting sidetracked with other subplots that would have been far less satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was also done very well considering only 12 episodes were aired - not too much was packed into the plot so that what the audience is left is is a jumbled mess that falls on top of itself, and not too little is shown that the audience is bored out of their skulls. Each episode brought a new surprise and problem that was a great enjoyment to watch. And much to my pleasure, there were many moments that sent shivers of excitement and anticipation whenever Sora or Shiro's plans started to become more and more evident - these feelings were strikingly similar to those I experienced while watching Code Geass whenever Leleouch demonstrated his high intellect. I almost couldn't help but either smirk as if I were Shiro himself watching his opponents gasp in disbelief or have my jaw drop. It was nice to relive such a stimulating experience.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there were some moments in the story that I found to be questionable as the story progressed. The conclusions of many major games were highly enjoyable, but there were some conclusions that I felt were simply far too convenient for it to justify the intense buildup that occurred in previous episodes. Additionally, I felt as though there was a tad bit too much fan service. Now I do realize that fanservice is a big aspect of the anime culture, but with the story as it is and its excellent progress, I actually felt as if the fan service was slightly out of place. Traditionally, while fanservice is specifically designed to please the viewers, I felt like NGNL really could have done without it. If anything, I felt that it detracted from the show. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nNGNL's art is definitely another reason to admire the show. The very fluid and great animation was done by Madhouse, who were also the ones who helped animate Wolf Children. So it didn't come as a great surprise that the art would do the story justice. The art is very bright, vibrant, and displays a huge array of colors. The show did a great job of shifting the very epic, serious scenes with some of the more comedic or explanatory chibi-style scenes without detracting from the plot. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was composed by Shinji Hosoe (who runs Super Sweeo) along with his long time collaborator Ayako Saso and several others. Shinji Hosoe was responsible for composing the soundtrack of 999, (a Nintendo DS visual novel game) a personal favorite of my library. The soundtrack did its part well, providing analytical-esque, techno music during scenes where strategies were discussed and very soft pieces during the more touching moments. But most notably, we can see that Super Sweep emphasized a lot of their music on the driving, epic soundtracks. One of the most memorable songs is probably Coulomb's Force, which is played when the pinnacle of the game is reached and when the protagonists' plans are finally revealed. \\n\\n\r\nThe music by itself was able to send shivers down my spine when I first heard it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe show offers an interesting cast and has very strong lead characters; and surprisingly, despite the short nature of the show, a substantial amount of characters were able to have their backstories revealed on the show. But as the backstories were short themselves, there is still not as much investment and sympathy for the more supporting characters of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs many others have easily pointed out, Sora is reminiscent of Lelouch at many times whenever he plays a game and is orchestrating different tactics to throw off the enemy; however, he also has a very comical and non-serious side that balances out the complete bad-assery he demonstrates throughout the show. His sense of humor is quite unique as it can switch from being snarky and sarcastic to simply self-deprecating and embarrassing. It is far more easier to relate to Sora since he is far more human than many other protagonists - he has flaws. Shiro is a bit less relatable than Sora is, but that doesn't seem to detract too much from her character. Shiro is highly analytical and quiet. And while she may not have a loud voice, her impressive, quick calculations speak far bigger volumes and often become the highlight of many game conclusions. She's very quick to criticize Sora and will not hesitate to force Sora to reflect on his actions whenever he is close to making a mistake. \\n\\n\r\nBut the charm of Sora and Shiro's characters shine their brightest when both come together as a team - \"Blank\". Sora and Shiro's sibling relationship are the highlight of the show. Shiroa and Sora, despite having an age difference, treat each other equally - which really helps add on to the idea that the two of them are two halves of one whole team. Not to mention that Shiro's computative abilities combined with Sora's quick thinking and impressive behavioral reading skills make them seem almost impervious to any game thrown at them, like a God. NGNL does an excellent job of being able to both show off both of the siblings' skills individually and demonstrate the gargantuan power of their unity. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters, such as Steph and Jibril, provide much of the story's fanservice and comic relief; however, they do have major contributions to the plans that Sora and Shiro construct, whether it be in a game or in simple politics, which make them an integral addition to the sibling's journey of defeating the God of their world. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nNo Game No Life is a wonderful addition to the anime library with its simplistic, yet enthralling story that has each episode enthusiastically volunteering itself to become a puzzle piece that continually adds to the full picture. The entire show has felt like a series of chess moves that push towards the long awaited moment where Sora and Shiro finally place the God in check. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I typically find many shows that follow such storytelling to eventually fall on its face and trip into a convoluted mess, I was pleasantly surprised to find that No Game No Life steps up where others have failed.",

            "content": "I just finished watching this at the time of writing this review (literally several minutes), so its pretty fresh in my mind.\r\nThe first thing that you'll notice about this series is the art. It has a strange color scheme, giving it a very fantasy-style vibe, but also gives it the air of a dream sequence. The colours are bright and smooth, and quite unique. You might be put off by this, by I felt that it was a nice attempt at something different.\r\nThe set pieces are quite nice, with huge chess pieces in the background and vast kingdoms and buildings. On a smaller scale, however,the designs for all the characters are quite bland and unoriginal. The art and animation is good quality, but they aren't really special, and Shiro's mouth shape just seems weird to me.\\n\r\nAnother thing is how most of the women happen to have very large breasts (one character's breasts appear to grow after she removes her top). There are plenty of bath-scenes, and although the nudity isn't that graphic, I would not recommend watching this series in front of anybody who respects you.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that the characters were a big pitfall in this series. The two MCs that are introduced at the start come off as arrogant, and unbelievable. They go on about how all games they participate in are 'won before they even begin.' They are then spruced up with Shiro being superhumanly intelligent (being able to perform ridiculous physics calculations in seconds, and learning a new language without instruction through reading a book that she picked up), and even Sora being insanely intelligent.\\n\r\nAt the other end of the scale is Stephanie, another leading character, who seems to be unbelievably stupid. She is stated to be very intelligent, yet she falls for obvious tricks, even after deep analysis.\\n\r\nThroughout the entire series, there was only one character who I did not dislike/hate.\\n\\n\r\nMy one big gripe about the story is how everything has to be so convoluted. Its not very difficult to follow, its just so unnecessarily complex. Imagine Death Note, but without the back-and-forth plays between Light and L, instead just having one side going 'I'm a genius! Check out how I planned everything! I'm better than you!!' That's pretty much what happens in every conflict, with the MCs essentially giving out that speech every time. This problem is only made worse when you (very quickly) realise that all that deep thought and master-planning wasn't actually necessary, and could have been achieved far quicker, or that the losers lost because that were just too stupid to (fairly easily) not fall into the trap, or just too arrogant to win quickly and simply. Not only that, but a lot of the seemingly deep planning is actually really predictable an d obvious. Honestly, the show just tried too hard to seem smart.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, I thought the voice acting was okay, but I'm just not really a fan of that cheery pop-music (which happens to be in most anime). If you like that music, you won't have a problem with this.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, the problems with the characters and the plot, and the resolution of every single conflict made this a drag for me to sit through.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOverall: 5",

            "content": "No Game No Life is another one of those light-novel adaptations about a someone, or in this case two someones, being thrown into a game world. And you know what? It's completely fine, 100%. I'm not going to deduct points because it's wish-fulfillment, fiction is supposed to be escapism. Hell, even though I'm not a fan of fanservice, it doesn't make that anime any worse for simply having it - it depends on how they utilize it. But hey, let me break it down:\r\n~STORY~\r\nNGNL's story is, for lack of a better phrase, a slightly more imaginative take on the now very common story of 'peoplego into a game world'. Rather, instead of being stuck in a game world where you're essentially living in a video game, health bars and skill trees included; NGNL's world is one that is run BY games. Want to do something that would normally be done by violence? Nope, play a game to decide the outcome instead! This difference in plot compared to similar shows of its kind is what gives NGNL more possibilities. Add magic (Since it is a fantasy world) and you can make these games as complicated (or convoluted) as you like. When the brother-sister, NEET, gaming genius pair are brought into the fantasy world they are finally able to shine with their gaming abilities (See where the wish-fulfillment comes from?). The overall story is... pretty simple. \"What\" will be done is predictable, but \"how\" they do it is a completely different, and that's where NGNL's actual GAMES come into play.\\n\r\nThe games that are played in NGNL are... interesting. This is where opinions will vary when discussing NGNL. I personally like Liar Game style games, and NGNL does have that sort of out-think your opponent mindset in most of its games. However, there is a point where cleverness (like the Shiritori game, my favorite) turns into 'Really? I know it's fiction but REALLY??'. Depending on your tolerance levels for that sort of thing, where you've thought 200 steps ahead several days before something even takes place (exaggeration, but not by much), will determine how you enjoy them.\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\r\nYou know what? I really enjoy the art of NGNL. The backgrounds look pretty, the fantasy world looks nice and the effects that they give to the more magical elements is just fine. The character designs are a bit... standard, I guess is the word I'd use. Moe-blob loli's; big-breasted, large-eyed girls; and a male protagonist looks like a cross between Steins;gate and Bakemonogatari's protagonists. But where the art in NGNL really shines, and I mean REALLY is the colouring. Oh man it looks great and shiny and clean and oh I just love it~\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\r\nNo tracks I particularly care about, but it did fit and it worked fine. Nothing outstanding, nothing terrible.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~\\n\r\nLet me set aside the main character and get to the side characters first...\\n\r\nThey're just kind of okay. There. I said it. The princess girl, angel girl, mysterious anti-hero (sorta) girl and elf girl are all just okay. One is bad at games but means well, one pursues knowledge and is a pervert, one seems to be a 'baddie' but is misunderstood and can't trust the protagonist, one is... uhh... almost completely undefined but she knows magic so yay. They'll get stripped and be embarrassed, blush and dress provocatively and whatever. They can be funny, they can be annoying, but what they don't do is be any more than average side characters that will either endear or annoy you based on their quirks.\\n\\n\r\nThe main pair Sora and Shiro, together known as the blank, are a little better. First Shiro, the moe-blob, imouto genius girl; she's cute, she's (unexpectedly) bad-ass, and she was actually pretty fun. Aside from all the genius stuff, I'd say her personality is more like a kitten, all cute and cuddly and cute and cute. Yeah okay, she's cute. She's also 11, so I wish I didn't get so many panty-shots of her. Sora is, however, my favourite character with the widest range of expression. Yeah, he's a straight up NEET and pervert, a strategist that thinks a hundred turns ahead, he'll suddenly get bursts of confidence and he'll have moments where he gives nice little speeches. But above all, he's fun. In lots of shows about playing games, often you see hardly anyone having 'fun', but not NGNL. Sora has fun, so I have fun. The interactions between the two are also very enjoyable, and they nicely highlight each others character differences. The two of them certainly aren't deep, but they're enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nIf it weren't for the two protagonists being a enjoyable, I feel like I would've enjoyed the show a lot less. If it went the Yu-gi-oh! route of game playing where everyone is serious despite playing games all the time, the show would've certainly fell flat. However, NGNL is fun, and it is enjoyable, and it gets it. It understands that, despite often high stakes, they're playing games and they're having fun (well, the main characters anyway). So well done NGNL.\\n\\n\r\n~OVERALL~\\n\r\nI like a well written story and well written characters, and to be honest, this show has neither. But it has a solid core that allows for variety, it has energy, and it has fun. And hey, it tells you that it's going to have fun from the get go, so props to it. So while I can't say it is a \"great\" anime, it is definitely an enjoyable one. I'll be watching for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nToodles~",

            "content": "No Game No Life is about a brother and sister, Sora and Shiro, when put together, are the best gamers in the world. One day, a boy by the name of Tet, who claims he is God, takes the two siblings to another world. In this alternate universe, there are 16 races, including humans. However, the human kind in their world, can be considered the equivalent of ants in our world, because every race except for humans have some sort of special power, whether it might be magic, a sixth sense or extreme strength. In this world, humans are forced to the brink of extinctionand our main characters take the role of not only saving humanity, but to also conquer all the other races that exist.\\n\\n\r\nStory [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t say the story of No Game No Life is very unique, but it is definitely very entertaining to watch and compared to all other similar shows, it would be one of the best. The anime isn\u2019t very deep but does provoke some thought as you will be trying to follow the logic and processing of two geniuses. There aren\u2019t any key themes as the show is quite shallow and entertainment based. Overall, the story of No Game No Life is very enjoyable and will keep you hooked throughout all 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nWhen you think of No Game No Life, you think of its unique art style. The colours used in this anime are vibrant and warm. I really appreciated this as it differed greatly from the average anime art. However, after watching around 5 episodes, I got a slight headache and my eyes became quite sore as the colours are excessively bright.\\n\\n\r\nSound [7/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs of this anime are average, nothing worth mentioning. After finishing the show, I never bothered to search it up again to listen to. Music inside the episodes are fitting but also did not stand out much. The two main voice actors, however, did exceptionally well, especially Shiro\u2019s, who was done by Kayano Ai. The voice was very suitable and a perfect match for her character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nAlthough unrealistic, most of the characters in No Game No Life are easily lovable. As for character development, I wouldn\u2019t say there was too much of this on our two main characters but more on Stephanie Dora, a semi-main character. This being said, we still learn a fair share about Sora and Shiro\u2019s backgrounds but nothing about the rest of their family. The two characters also do not fail to surprise their audience and continue to exceed expectations throughout the entire series. The supporting characters are also very unique as there are 16 races and each and every one of these differentiate greatly. Even within the races, characters seemed to have their own special characteristics and traits.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9/10]\\n\r\nOverall [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nTo be completely honest, I didn\u2019t realise how much I actually enjoyed this anime until a couple weeks after finishing it. At the time, I was pretty distracted from the previous anime that I watched before No Game No Life, but now looking back, I really liked this series and am looking forward to a second season of this awesome show!",

            "content": "No Game No Life is one of the most hyped animes of spring 2014.\r\nSo let's start the review.\r\nStory:\r\nI love NGNL's concept. Siblings transferred to another world where everything was settled with games. But the twist is here is that they don't want to go back.\r\n Blank are considered as a Mary Sue, which means there victory is assured and how they win is the story all about. The good thing here is that how they win is a mystery and that is why many people liked it. Sora pulled a Deus ex Machima in epsiode 4.(i think) The pacing is good. But the story isfull of fanservices in almost every episode which destroys the story itself. The jokes sucks too.\\n\r\nBut I'm gonna give the story 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nMadhouse did a pretty good job. I love the color palette. Every scene was colorful. Animation is good. The colors were vibrant and fits the show. I am gonna give the art a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOP is amazing. It shows what NGNL is. It makes you excited.\\n\r\nThe ED is more of a soft song that gives you feels.\\n\r\nNuff said. 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nBlank:\\n\r\nBlank are absolute Mary Sues. They are one dimensional characters.\\n\r\nSora is just pervert but a genius player. He can be a little silly but when it comes to games he gets serious. Shiro is a smart girl who is basically smarter than Sora but aside from that she is your typical imouto loli.\\n\r\nOther characters are only fanservice fodders. They became like that when they lose to Blank. The characters are mediocre at best. 6\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEven with NGNL's flaws its enjoyment made many people like it. The clever tricks made by Blank was enjoyed by many people. If you are a gamer the more you will enjoy and like this anime. 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt was enjoyable had a amazing story but it was brought down by some unremarkable negative aspects. 7",

            "content": "No Game No Life is visual and suggestive exploitation and exposure of underage females pawned off as entertainment. And people wonder why the anime community receives so much hate and scorn and are labeled as \"pedophiles\" and stereotyped as fetishizing little girls.\r\nThere is nothing clever about this show. It's everything Death Note could have done wrong, done wrong. The main characters are already established as being unable to lose, so why become invested in anything they do? They're just gonna win anyway. It doesn't help that the rules of the game aren't even well explained half the time.\r\nWith 11 episodes, there's no room for anycharacter development (not that they tried) and the characters themselves are barely established as people. They're just 2 no-lives who like gaming an unrealistic amount and are placed in a dream-fulfillment reality where you game to win. The concept is promising I guess, and there a few well-executed mind games, but that's as far as the creativity and entertainment stretches after you realize they actually won't lose, no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really remember anything about the soundtrack (which shows how little impact it had), but I don't claim to be a soundtrack critic. A show should be good without relying on music to boost its score.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is really the only thing the show does right. It was pretty fluid and consistent throughout and the backgrounds were well done. It was too bright and vibrant for my personal taste, but that's all it is, personal taste. It fit well with the fantasy setting, but my eyes didn't care.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show perfectly tailored for people who want to see some indecent exposure and get a few good perverted giggles out of it and then pretend like it's a masterpiece because it's masquerading as a games anime. \"Let's have an episode entirely dedicated to explaining the rules of the world and showing the consequences for losing. Then let's follow that up with a sauna scene where an 8 year old girl is almost naked as her brother gets hard for her and this other chick\" HAHAHA FUCKING GENIUS WRITING!!! SUPER CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10 (For good art/animation and a few decent games)",

            "content": "Once upon a time, there was a boy who watched an anime series and fell in love.\r\nLovestruck, he scrutinized the reactions of other people watching the anime, and the positive reviews and high ratings brought a smile to his face :)\r\nBut alas, just as the anime scrolls had foretold, the smart-alecks eventually started watching the anime.\r\nThey had heard the legends about this anime's greatness, and screamed:\r\n\"No! All anime must have flaws.\r\nIf an anime is a 10, it's against the laws!\r\nI'm a self-absorbed git that needs to get a life!\r\nI must rate this anime as lower than a 5!\r\nPeople call this anime good? That definitely won'tdo.\\n\r\nOh look here! A panty shot! A flash of boobs too!\\n\r\nMy nose-bleed can't handle it! Let's give it a four.\\n\r\nOh wait, no wait! There is even more...\\n\r\nThe story actually involves humans? How unoriginal!\\n\r\nIt's just like that other anime. They practically copied it all!\\n\r\nNow that we have another excuse, let's just give it a three.\\n\r\nI actually secretly enjoyed it, but keep that between you and me.\\n\r\nWe are the \"real\" reviewers. Oh my gawd I'm so smart!\\n\r\nRather than watch anime, you should hear my brain fart!\"\\n\\n\r\nOnce they found the tiny blemishes of the anime called \"originality\" and \"fan-service\".\\n\r\nThey decided that nothing else mattered, and started hating on the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing all this, the poor boy cried out rivers of sorrow.\\n\r\nHe tried desperately to defend his beloved anime, but the haters called him a fan-boy and ignored him.\\n\r\nBut after watching the anime a second time, the boy wiped off his tears.\\n\r\nHe knew the anime was great, and decided to show it in a review.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so it starts...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't caught on by now, this review is for all those haters out there complaining about \"originality\" and \"fan-service\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: (9/10 Great)\\n\\n\r\nNo Game No Life(hereafter referred to as NGNL) is a splendid anime about a pair of brilliant-minded brother and sister, who travel to a parallel universe where gaming is everything.\\n\r\nBeing excellent gamers themselves, they proceed to conquer the world, one step at a time.\\n\\n\r\nNow, some of you may say at this point that the story doesn't seem all that new.\\n\r\nMaybe so, but this hardly matters because of the smart games and plot twists that make the overall story very interesting and unique to behold.\\n\r\nThere are times when everything seems lost, but our two protagonists will demonstrate a brilliant plan and eventually overcome any obstacle they face.\\n\r\nThere will inevitably be someone saying \"But Kaiji...!\". Well, Kaiji is a great anime in its own rights, I'm not denying that.\\n\r\nBut to combine so many different elements, such as ecchi fan-service, fantastical races and magic, as well as comedy into an anime so that they fit and work together so well is not something you see everyday.\\n\r\nFurthermore, the entire story is tied in smoothly to an overall plot of conquering the world. Unlike other animes, such as Kaiji, that has been divided into no-so-smooth arcs.\\n\r\nThe story is well-paced to give a balance of entertainment and progress in plot, and each episode will leave you wondering about what will happen next.\\n\r\nAlso, the fan-service is just enough to keep the ecchi fans interested, and does not get in the way of the plot. (The ecchi is often part of the plot)\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I'd like to argue that anime need not be original in the first place. Unlike college application essays or scientific journals, anime solely exist to entertain people, and NGNL has proven itself to excel here.\\n\r\nSo \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\",\\n\r\nand haters, no more complaining about originality xD\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10 Outstanding):\\n\\n\r\nVibrant, beautiful colors, as well as detailed background and beautiful characters have more than succeeded in seducing my eyes.\\n\r\nWhat more can I say..\\n\r\nJust by typing in NGNL in Google, you should be able to glimpse what I am talking about.\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth, and the action scenes are quite cool.\\n\r\nThe characters are well proportioned, and the girls look very gorgeous (and sometimes boobalicious).\\n\r\nJibril is my personal favorite :D\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10 Good):\\n\\n\r\nNothing too special here, tbh.\\n\r\nThe characters have realistic thoughts and reactions, but there are some stereotypes at work here.\\n\r\nThe two protagonists are as awesome as they should be, and even with their overpoweredness, gets the audience to sympathize with them and root for them throughout the series.\\n\r\nJibril is somewhat weird, what with her majestic looks and ditzy personality. However that makes her quite funny and cute (?), at least for me it does xD\\n\r\nSteph is stupid :P She was, is, and forever will be. Least favorite character, and perhaps she could've been made a little less silly.\\n\r\nOverall though, the characters were quite good (especially the protagonists).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10 Great):\\n\\n\r\nNice OP and ED music, as well as theme music & soundtracks.\\n\r\n\"This Game\" is one of my favorite anime music, but that might just be because I absolutely love piano music.\\n\r\nAll of the music fit in well with the theme of the anime and with the specific scenes they are used in.\\n\r\nThe sound effects are well done, nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10 Outstanding):\\n\\n\r\nLoved it, love it, and I mean every moment of it.\\n\r\nI really haven't enjoyed an anime this much since Code Geass.\\n\r\nI would actually say that I enjoyed NGNL even more than Code Geass because I prefer the more laid-back and fun atmosphere of NGNL.\\n\r\nEnjoyed the fan-service, the comedy, and so many other things (including Jibril).\\n\r\nA definite 10 for me here!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10 Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nThere really is something for most people out there in this anime:\\n\\n\r\nYou like fanservice? NGNL's got it (appropriate amounts of it)\\n\r\nYou like cool or OP MC? NGNL's got it\\n\r\nYou like psychological/strategy stuff? NGNL's got it\\n\r\nYou like colorful art? NGNL's got it\\n\r\nYou like nice music? NGNL's got it\\n\r\nWhisper: *You like lolis?* *NGNL's got it*\\n\\n\r\nIs there really a question? 10/10 for me!\\n\r\nand may I just add that I don't understand the people rating this anime as a \"4\" or lower. According to MAL's grading scale, \"4\" is for \"bad\" anime. But haters gonna hate, too bad they're missing out ;)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading all of this!\\n\\n\r\nSigning out,\\n\r\n\tjizzaloo\\n",

            "content": "\u201cI\u2019m sure you know what this means.\u201d - Jibril, Episode 6.\r\nMe: Actually, I have no idea. \r\nI know that the unimaginable hype surrounding this anime has long since passed its prime, but let's just ignore that.\r\nFrom what I've seen so far, everyone either hates or adores this anime. In fact, so much that it's almost black and white. I found that, as a whole, it is neither as bad. Or as good as most people make it out to be. It had its fair share of flaws, and wasn't something that left me sitting at my computer in amazement, but I will say that itis enjoyable and a decent anime.\\n\r\nThe plot of NGNL is a plot that we've all seen countless times in the past, yet the makers of the anime were still able to squeeze in a touch of originality, such as violence is forbidden (as opposed to being encouraged in similar situations in other anime), and that everything is decided by games. That even, upon further thought, leads me to wonder whether it even is a game world, since no one in there apart from our main protagonists have the slightest clue that our own world exists. Also, the two MCs are glad to be in this world.\\n\r\nApart from this, there was frankly nothing worth mentioning in terms of plot. Sure, now and then there were some plot twists (a partly accurate term) and cliffhangers, but other than that, there was no particularly evident plot line. Most of the aforementioned twists  came seemingly out of nowhere and ended just as suddenly with a sudden burst of epiphany from the part of either Shiro or Sora. Most of them had no further consequences or effects on the story line.\\n\r\nFurthermore, it was another one of those annoying cases that despite being rushed, it was incredibly slow-paced.\\n\r\nMy poor soul also didn\u2019t realise that it was an Ecchi until it was too late. I would expand more on it, but let it suffice to say that it did nothing for the plot line. Coupled with this was a sense of forced and exaggerated comedy element, full of exaggerations (such as characters bashing the walls with their heads), somewhat sexual and shallow jokes. Dialogue goes hand in hand with this - for instance how Sora is constantly obsessed with underwear, or how he promises the soldier chess pieces the right to \u2018bang\u2019 any woman that they want. \\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 6/10, because despite it\u2019s flaws, it\u2019s safe to say that I found it interesting and watched a number of episodes in a row.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is possibly the weirdest that I have seen. Whilst it\u2019s not actually that bad, the colours are way to vivid and weird. \\n\r\nThe main thing I didn\u2019t like about the art was that often, physical traits were much too accentuated, such as Shiro\u2019s numerous huge ahoges as well as cat-shaped mouth and the bags under Sora\u2019s eyes. Also, when it came to other characters, the shape and size of their breasts was often very evident - not to mention that their outfits were often very revealing. \\n\r\nStill, I guess it is commendable that the art style is fresh and new - it\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before. Just saying that perhaps some must have to be careful. 6.5/10. \\n\\n\r\nMusic was possibly one of my favourite aspects of the show. Some of the themes were quite\u2026 epic (in terms of genre, I mean) and totally befitting of the show. Whilst they weren\u2019t my favourites, I really liked the OP and ED of it.\\n\r\nVoice acting is another story. In order to suit the characters perhaps, the voices were not all that pleasant - for instance Shiro\u2019s was almost always monotonous and soft. Sometimes, different character\u2019s voices sounded so similar I questioned whether or not it was the same person voicing them. To summarise, it was as if they were trying to use the voices for the character\u2019s personality to come across better. \\n\r\nI would give it an 8, if not for the voices. As such, it stands at 7.5/10. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, onto the element that I disliked the most of this show\u2026 characters. \\n\r\nThe characters essentially brought down the entire show. They might have been a little interesting if not for the fact that they are entirely unrealistic (in terms of personality) and that I\u2019ve seen them so many times before. We\u2019ve got the usual girl-oriented gamer brother (Sora), along with the genius, not-understanding-human-interactions kuudere little sister (Shiro) - the two of them make up the very stereotypical NEETs who stay at home all day and are scared of the sunlight, outside world and being more than 10 metres apart from each other - the typical idiotic fan service character (Steph) and Jibril. I\u2019m not entirely sure what category she would fall into (perhaps the bookworm), but let me assure you that her character was not fresh. \\n\r\nI will admit that the character\u2019s little quirks did provide for a little entertainment, but they were just much too stale. I give \u2018character\u2019s a 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, this anime was okay. I wouldn\u2019t really watch it again (or recommend it to my friends), some scenes made me feel plain awkward, some of it was ridiculous, some of it was funny and some of it was interesting. In the end, it would be wrong to say that I disliked it. In fact, I liked it more than I thought I would.\\n\r\nI might just add that this is an anime that shows that you must not judge by first episodes. If it had kept up the same standard as the first episode all the way through, it would have been a 4 or a 5. However, it comes to:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.3/10 (rounded to a 6)\\n\\n\r\nSuch a score means that whilst it was a little below average, it was still enjoyable. Just don\u2019t start watching it with huge expectations.\\n\\n\r\nOne more note: This review was really hard to write. I would expect that it would be below the norm of my other ones. Sorry!",

            "content": "Games come in many forms. Some take the shape of a guy in a horned helmet that shouts people off cliffs and talks to knee injured guards. Other types involve moving a bunch of pieces to capture a specific piece called a King. But no matter the kind of game being played, what\u2019s most important, is knowing how to boost that gamerscore. After all, nothing beats having a stupid high number and being called Godlike.\r\nWell, except for becoming an actual God. And as far as No Game No Life\u2019s setting\u2014Disboard\u2014is concerned, a really high number isn\u2019t needed either, because the magic number is 16. Thereare 16 races called the Exceed, but if one race can conquer the rest (whatever that means), the leader of that race will then have the right to challenge, and become, the God of Disboard. Of course, 15 to 1 isn\u2019t good odds, but for gamer siblings Sora and Shiro\u2014also known as \u2018Blank\u2019\u2014the smallest chance for a win is a guarantee for victory.\\n\\n\r\nIronically, I come up with a blank whenever I try to think of any reason to care for Sora and Shiro. Their story is the old tale of a zero in the real world who becomes a hero in another world. They jump at the chance to leave the real world they hate so much, to live in Disboard where gaming skills are what matters. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to care for them when their backstory is so scarce. There are only a few glimpses of their time in the real world, meaning there\u2019s little development of any reason they closed themselves off from others, to foster complete faith in each other.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s unfortunate too, because Sora and Shiro\u2019s trust in each other surfaces several times throughout the story. These moments, from lip-locking to survive their own gambits, to literally putting their existence on the line for each other, aren\u2019t as powerful as they can be. Because outside of those moments, they\u2019re a comedy duo without much transition between their antics and adoration; they swing from humor to drama, to jarring effect. Said another way, Sora and Shiro lack the sincerity and the development needed to make their relationship compelling. To make them worth caring about.\\n\\n\r\nOn the bright side, Sora and Shiro still have some semblance of a story, to cover how simplistically archetypical they are. Sora is sarcastically charismatic, while Shiro is the emotionless little sister. Jibril follows suit on simple archetypes, being the perverted knowledge seeker but with even less story than Sora and Shiro. Then things get really weird with Steph, whose backstory is actually touched upon more than Sora and Shiro\u2019s, at the expense of her having no personality at all. Unless I\u2019m willing to count \u2018being a love slave,\u2019 but that\u2019s not even her own doing. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously. With the characters being as choppily written as they are, I almost forget what it is I like about this show. Well, underneath the slough of barely developed backstories being pushed aside for random antics, is something legitimately good when the show stops messing around. See, No Game No Life can be divided in two parts. One is the mundane, normal parts, and basically centers on the characters doing whatever, from walking around town, to negotiating with another faction, to messing around in the bath (of course\u2026). They\u2019re character centric, but the characters are bland, and these scenes are throwaway.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there are the parts of the show that represent half of No Game No Life\u2019s namesake. Remember, Disboard is a world where your gaming skills are what will carry you. And in order for Sora and Shiro to become the God of Disboard, they must use their gaming skills to conquer the other races. Because in Disboard, all disputes are resolved through games. Said games can be anything from blackjack to virtual reality shooters. There\u2019s often magic involved, and Sora and Shiro usually have to outthink their overpowered opponents.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it. Is. Glorious. Chess pieces will have loyalty, words can create the universe, memories are played piece by piece, and mathematics make for very tricky bullet shots. Indeed, the reason to watch No Game No Life is for its crazy games. Or, more accurately, to see how what crazy plan Sora and Shiro come up with to try and win each game. Much of what they scheme for\u2014like the insane amount of calculations needed to predict where and when someone will show up right when they need it\u2014is both confounding and amazing.\\n\\n\r\nNow, all of these plans seem impossible, but that\u2019s what that stands out about Sora and Shiro the most. Their sheer intellect lets them do the impossible, notice what others cannot (the card is a lie!), and fight the powers that would otherwise overwhelm others. It reflects the (still scarce) story of Steph\u2019s background that partly deals with wisdom VS power, so the ridiculous gambits in these games have mythos behind the madness. A reason in the story to happen. Sure, the characters themselves are still bland, but what they do in the games and the games themselves are something else to see.\\n\\n\r\nThough speaking of things to see, now\u2019s as good a time as any to talk about the aesthetics. But to be honest, I\u2019m not sure whether I love how this show looks because of the amount of pink, or whether I hate how this show looks because of the amount of pink. There\u2019s a pink hue everywhere in the show from the castle town of Elkia to the forest of the Eastern Federation, but at least it makes for something uniquely vibrant and almost neon-like in its colors. It\u2019s almost to the point where \u2018outlines\u2019 on characters or backdrops don\u2019t exist.\\n\\n\r\nBut slight hints of pink aside, the backdrops are varied and play with the fact Disboard is a fantasy world. The 18th century houses, cobblestone streets, and brick castle at the apex give Elkia a distinctly medieval feel, which won\u2019t be mistaken for the classical, oriental design of the Eastern Federation\u2019s buildings. The games themselves also take on a life of their own, sometimes literally through words, other times through virtual simulation. Unfortunately, the character designs leave a lot to be desired. Except for Jibril, whose design fulfills desires I never even knew I had.\\n\\n\r\nAHEM.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, I\u2019d think better of the music if I counted the opening and closing numbers of any show. After all, This Game by Konomi Suzuki is quite energetic while Oracion by Ai Kayano is like a fast paced lullaby. But since I don\u2019t, that leaves only the music within the show. That said, while none of the pieces are distinct, they do what they need to do in setting the mood from the everyday to the faster pace of some games, especially the last one. It also has a surprising amount of quiet grace, where little to no music in some situations\u2014the first major game comes to mind\u2014creates a real feeling of tension.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s just a shame that tension in any of the games isn\u2019t as authentic as it could be. The lack of development, personality, and backstory among the characters\u2014anything I could use to call them compelling\u2014falls short of even being decent. Of course, when a game gets going, the bland cast is overshadowed by the crazy games that are carried well by the aesthetics. And yes, No Game No Life could be worth watching for the crazy games alone. Keyword being \u2018could.\u2019 Just think real carefully about what you\u2019re looking for, or it might be game over before you can say \u2018Aschente!\u2019",

            "content": "Believe it or not, but NGNL is the hip thing of 2014. A lot of people liked it, similarly a lot of people disliked it, but all in all, they were all watching it and talking about it. I've recently been to MAL and learned that even after accountable negative criticism, the rating still stands at 8.76, which can be round-off to 9, which in MAL terms comes under \"Great\". Although this isn't the first case, and pretty likely, not the last, but let's use this as an example and try to think \"How?\" and \"Why?\"\r\nAs we can clearly make it out from the synopsis,it's a series about people playing various games for resolving everyday issues, from trifling matters to the ones concerning national interest. Our two main protagonists gets sucked in to this world after they accept a challenge from an unknown person. Let's just say they are supposed to be the ultimate bad ass when it comes down to games, as a combo [Blank], they have the record and confidence to beat anyone at any game, hence their motto - \"Blank never lose\". Our protagonists have been introduced as NEETs, shut-ins and are suffering from communication disorder. Although I've seen anime based on \"gaming reality\" before - SAO, Accel World, etc., and I agree that parents/guardians in anime world can be a bit extreme (ex - opens door, the girl and boy are in awkward position, says best of luck to them and closes the door), but what kind of parents/guardians let their children remain totally cut-off from the world and be cooped up in their rooms, where they can play games day and night? This, along with other incidents, leads up to the apt image of the show as wish-fulfilling and an escapist's fantasy. It's true that most people turn towards entertainment to escape from daily lives, so watching characters do the same immediately forms a bridge between viewer and those characters. This becomes one of the biggest selling points of such series, which in business sense, is a good thing. But..\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut the characterization is pretty much messed up. It's easy to see that both Sora and Shiro aren't the most sociable people around [Even while you are sociable enough on net, sitting behind a monitor, it's altogether different from when you are sitting face-to-face with someone]. Still, the way Sora communicates and reacts in the other world, quickly makes one question the character description they've been spoon-fed just minutes ago, more so, when that person supposed to have communication disorder. Writer must be smoking joint. Anyway, then you have a loli with striped panties - Shiro, who is insanely intelligent, however in a slightly different way than her aniki. Together they cover for each others weak spots and hence as a combo they are unbeatable. Now what does that tell you? The statement \"Blank never lose\" is pretty much a boner-killer, especially when the stakes are ridiculously high, it not only ensures the victory of our duo even before the actual game even starts, but also take away that \"doki-doki\" factor as in \"how will it turn out? what's going to happen? will they win?\". The tagline itself gives a major setback to the \"gaming\" theme.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell this isn't the only show which is home to many pop-culture tropes such as cat-ears, elfs, etc. So criticizing it just because of that doesn't seem the right thing to do. But what's the deal with these Japanese otaku fetishes? LOL. Since the series is heavily focused on otaku pleasure, setting wise it's only the right thing to do to ensure maximum profit, but what has happened to originality lately? The show is about characters getting sucked in another world, which although being one of the most generic settings, provides a lot of room to explore and experiment, to create some original character and world designs, to explore and push some creative boundaries. Take a look at Monogatari series, which also use many pop-culture tropes and even cliche' events, but still is able to pull off a refresh feel because of rich and uniquely explored characters and it's overall execution, it's impact-full. But NGNL was made to just earn money, we can't blame Madhouse for our disappointment, they are also suffering from declining market for innovative and intellectual stuff. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEven side-characters are not a relief, they are just there to please the audience with fan-service and to help further the esteemed goals of our protagonists. What am I supposed to feel for them, \"Good boobs you got there\" maybe.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show is about games but weighs heavily on random ass pulls to make our protagonists look like the ultimate bad ass winners. Ass pulls leads up to logical fallacies, which ultimately results in plot holes. For ex - \\n\\n\r\nJibril vs Blank game -\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILER]\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nThe rules say - \"if the thing is present there, it'll disappear and if it's not, then it'll appear\". Sora says \"Hydrogen Bomb\", which appears. Okay, now where does it say that it has to be a hydrogen bomb which is about to go off. Last time I checked, Hydrogen Bomb doesn't go off on their own.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n[/SPOILER]\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven the infamous \"last fight\" in which Sora gets praised for his smartness, is nothing but the result of convenience in writing.\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILER]\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nThe level of assumption without actually knowing and analyzing the full extent of your opponent is not just dangerous but can be fatal. Even if Sora had assumed that Izuna has some kind of technique that pushes beyond the normal psychical boundaries, the extent of that can't be known precisely, even after being released, because one can't be sure of the extent up to which it can transcend. But somehow Sora and Shiro had it all figured out from the scribblings that Shiro did on the sand, without any proper explanation given, to the point of saying - \"Oh! I made it in time\". That's not intelligent thinking, that's convenient writing.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n[/SPOILER]\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show also make use of references to a lot of famous anime and gaming titles, as an addition to the comedy aspect. Needless to say this isn't anything original either, series like Gintama are pawning major titles with their sense of humor for a long time now. Even so, I believe the jokes in NGNL are pretty good, if there's anything good in the series, then this is clearly it. I followed this series weekly, so it served as a time-pass and mood changer from the TV series I was into that time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation wise, the show did a fine job. It was colorful and vibrant, pretty good for lightening up the mood after watching something serious/depressing. Music wasn't memorable enough, in fact I can't even recall a single soundtrack. So no points there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sense and meaning of \"entertainment\" can vary from person to person. Some people just look for and enjoy a good time-pass, some have their fetishes to deal with, some look for creativity and originality and some look for a certain smartness. A fair warning though, it can be irritating at times, especially if you are the type that seeks and enjoy a certain intellectual depth in any art or literature form. It is as good as the majority of anime out there. So do I recommend this anime? Personally NO, since I didn't find it good enough for anyone to purposely use their bandwidth and time over it. But, at the same time, if you have read the whole review and are fine with whatever is written, be my guest and watch the show.",

            "content": "(3.0/10)\r\nHow can something so verbose be so air headed? No matter how many explanations of absolutely out-there mind games this show tries to play, no matter how many times it flips a preconceived rule on its head, no matter how many times it dehumanizes a female, it\u2019s still just a hollow, lifeless shell. Or is it? For all the things i'm about to figuratively yell about, there's a creeping sensation that i'm completely wrong. \r\nTo keep my reviews fresh and somewhat engaging I try to structure every review differently. As in, I look at the structure of the show and adapt my review to fillthat structure. For example, in my HunterxHunter review, I split it into 7 parts. Each part represents one of the seven arcs in the show. It\u2019s a little device I use to maybe engage readers a little more, who knows if it works. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so I sit here wondering how the hell am I going to formulate this review for No Game No Life, because this show brings literally nothing to the table. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is so shallow, lifeless, and dull that I can\u2019t actually think of a way to make this review interesting. Under these layers of candy-coated color and over-saturated landscapes and extreme uses of light neon bouncy happy colors, this show does a poor job at hiding the fact that its pretty god damn lifeless. \\n\\n\r\nI know it\u2019s really douchey to attack someone for their likes and dislikes. \u201cYOU like SAO? What a peasant!\u201d \u201cYOU like Naruto!? Ha! What generic taste!\u201d \\n\r\nI get that\\n\\n\r\nSo bear with me as I act like a massive self-righteous douchebag in this review\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAre you kidding me, MAL? Are you kidding me anime fans? An 8.5? This show has an 8.5? THIS show? \\n\\n\r\nWhat the fuck.\\n\\n\r\nI get that \u201cturn your brain off\u201d, self-insert, escapist entertainment is well-liked in this community. I get that. And that\u2019s fine. There\u2019s nothing wrong with escapism. I don\u2019t personally think something should require \u201cturning off your brain\u201d to be enjoyable, but regardless, it\u2019s a common saying so I\u2019ll use it. \\n\\n\r\nBut what in the actual world compels this community to rate this show so highly, though? I get FMA, I may think it\u2019s horrendously overrated like every damn shounen action show I\u2019ve ever seen, but I get it. It does do things differently. \\n\r\n\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWhy this though? Why this? This isn\u2019t even SAO level awful, not even remotely close. But why? Is it because there are giant 2D tits on screen every episode? Is it cause this show uses the guise of self-awareness to pander to its fans? Is it the fucking unbearable trope of trying to make good-for-nothing NEETS seem cool, \u201cCause that\u2019s the demographic?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nI honestly can\u2019t tell. I just don\u2019t know. Why do people eat this shit up? Why is this show scoring better than half the Monogatari series? Or up there with Madoka? \\n\\n\r\nThere has never been a show with a base rating that has infuriated me so much due to that base rating. Saying I shouldn\u2019t care what people think of something is bullshit, too. Of course I care about entertainment. Of course I want the best entertainment possible. Everyone should care about what people think of something, especially when it comes to entertainment because this is our leisure time! We want the best of this! \\n\\n\r\nPeople thinking makes the world go around. I\u2019m also petty and get angry when people like stuff I don\u2019t like. I\u2019m a douche like that. \\n\\n\r\nIf people think this show is great and it becomes popular, then we\u2019ll have hundreds of copy cats the next year copying the shows formula. And that\u2019s this industry. So don\u2019t tell me that I shoudn\u2019t care. I know I\u2019m being a prick but fuck you I want to see something different, not something puts on lens-less glasses and goes \u201choi aren\u2019t I a smart guy! Look at my glasses!\u201d \\n\\n\r\nMan this show is shallow! Every female is fucking useless. Every. Single. One. Even the little sister which is made to seem like she\u2019s on even ground with her brother isn\u2019t really. Even when she needs to \u201csave\u201d him, its revealed that he always knew what he was doing. She\u2019s a device he wants to protect, he\u2019s a protector. And she\u2019s there to appeal to that male demographic instinct of protection, that\u2019s why she\u2019s created with being the cutest possible thing in mind. The show goes so far as to rub that cuteness in your face, yelling \u201cLook how cute she is!\u201d and it falls flat, in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s it, though. The big strong man is smarter and better at everything than these dumb, ditzy, drooling girls. Even the smart eleven year old Loli needs protection and care, cause god forbid someone is on the same level as our protagonist! \\n\r\n\u2026\\n\r\nI know I\u2019m sounding like some ranting feminist. Trust me, I\u2019m not. What gets to me isn\u2019t that a bunch of out-of-touch execs and manga writers think this is what will appeal to a bunch of shut-in virgins. That people are so shallow that when they see some jiggling tits, zany kazoo background music, and an overly convoluted explanation for something retarded that they\u2019ll give it an automatic 10/10. That\u2019s not what\u2019s annoying. \\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s annoying is that apparently it\u2019s true! That is what people want! This is a show that\u2019s almost in the top 100 highest rated anime EVER.\\n\\n\r\nHoly. Fuck. It wasn\u2019t even THAT bad. As I said, SAO was significantly more of a slog to get through and this show actually did get me to chuckle once every three or so episodes, which is more than I can say about most comedy anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s get into the actual show. Much like the show I started this review in a very loud, eccentric way. What I\u2019m saying has literally no substance in the long run and doesn\u2019t reflect what the populace actually thinks of this show. It\u2019s here to reiterate what many people ehav ealready said in the past about similar shows. This is the most generic possible anime that insults intelligence under the guise of something not-generic. It delivers cringe-inducing characterization choices. It\u2019s well animated, although the style itself is fairly ugly, in my dickish purde opinion. There\u2019s a few things we need to talk about. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe designs lack any inspiration at all. A show that can compared to this one is Konosuba. Which is a similar comedy-focused show that, although not lacking in faults, still felt somewhat inspired in various areas. Even the character designs were generally solid. \\n\\n\r\nHere in \u201cNo Game No Life\u201d, we have a generic MC who\u2019s there to be generic. He\u2019s a NEET with, as the show puts it, \u201csocial anxiety issues\u201d. However, he\u2019s one of the most charismatic people in the world who\u2019s perfect at talking and charming the ladies. Much like most NEETS are, right? Oh yeah, don\u2019t let this basement dwelling virgin that cuddles up with his eleven-year-old sister charm the panties off of you! This characterization is lacking in metaphoric chromosomes.\\n\r\n\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWe also have said sister. Who\u2019s eleven. And a imouto deadpan Loli.  That\u2019s it. That\u2019s her character. Everything else she shares with her brother. They\u2019re both inseparable from each other and there\u2019s a hint at incestuous love from her, but not enough for it to become something of substance since that\u2019d be TOO REAL for a show trying so hard to be self-aware of its ridiculousness. \\n\\n\r\nHer character design is similarly uninspired. While her brother is as generic looking as they come. You know, a sexy, fit, charismatic, basement dwelling virgin who stays up for days playing video games\u2026 she\u2019s this wild magical looking Loli. Which looked cartoonishly out of place in the real world. \\n\r\nI know the excuses people will use, too. \u201cWell Artrill, they aren\u2019t supposed to look of this world because they aren\u2019t!\u201d Yeah, I\u2019d believe that if our protagonist wasn\u2019t Gen-Ericson McGeneric. \\n\r\n\u2026\\n\\n\r\nEvery other notable side character is a moron girl that gets outclassed by our genius protagonist. It\u2019s also worth noting that there are two girl designs in this show. Big tittied monstrosity and flat-chested Loli. That\u2019s it. There is no in-between. There is no \u201cregular\u201d looking female character. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s big-boobied redhead punching bag, or \u201cSteph\u201d as they call her. They try and make her \"useful\" but every useful thing she does is because of our amazing main characters knack at manipulating her uselessness. I can\u2019t remember a single piece of dialogue she had past episode three because all her voice lines are just loud yelling and hysteria-driven shrieking. Which is HIIIILARIOUS!!! \\n\\n\r\nHave you ever seen a shounen action anime where every joke in the show is just a character reacting really loudly to something?! Well if the answer is yes then you must have seen every single shounen anime ever! Why the fuck is every single piece of comedy in these shows so in-your-face-forcd-down-your-throat? Where\u2019s the subtlety? Where\u2019s the nuance? Where\u2019s the not gag-inducing dialogue? No. How about we actually get some good gags at all! \\n\\n\r\nWhy does one in every fifty gags in this show feel original? Hell, half the time this show got me to exhale air through my nose (cause that\u2019s laughing) was because it was just copying something from a different show. Whether it\u2019s a Jojo, Evangelion, or Phoenix Wright reference. \\n\\n\r\nReferences aren\u2019t inherently bad either, and many shows piggy back on doing referential humor. A perfect example is Community, which is my all-time favorite comedy. The difference here is that the references in Community get utilized creatively. Entire episodes play homage to certain references. The show creates something new and original with them. \\n\r\n\u2026\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s bird girl. Or Gerbil. Or is it Jibril? I can\u2019t tell because she\u2019s just another big-tittied idiot who bends to our protagonists will after her introduction episode. \\n\\n\r\nExcept this one has wings!\\n\\n\r\nWow! You\u2019re really outdoing yourself with the character designs, show! Where\u2019d you go to design school? \u201cHow to pander to our base demographic\u201d-College? With a major in Fanservice-ollogy and a minor in I-Don\u2019t-care-enough-to-make-a-funny-minor-pun?! \\n\\n\r\nBow down, Monogatari, Cowboy Bebop, HunterxHunter, THIS is how you do character design! Creative, distinctive, well-drawn and personality-infused character designs? Pff! Who needs THAT! \\n\\n\r\nThis show does occasionally get a bit more sobering. And by that I mean the corny generic \u201ccomedy scene\u201d music stops and we get \u201cdrama\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nOr as I like to call it, \u201cRedhead crying hour\u201d, where our favorite busty redhead, Steph, cries for most of the episode. This happens for one or all of these reasons: \\n\\n\r\nA.)\tShe fucked up and is a moron, which leads to tears. \\n\r\nB.)\tShe gets insulted by our protagonist and is a moron, which leads to tears. \\n\r\nC.)\tShe\u2019s a useless moron there to be loud, eccentric, and fan-service bait that drools over our protagonist. She\u2019s sub-human trash I\u2019d treat like an empty bottle of Gatorade and throw in the trash.  She drools over our protagonist, even though he\u2019s \u201cawful\u201d, as she convinces herself in the most boring tsundere way.\\n\\n\r\nBut the show even half-asses that. She\u2019s not actually tsundere and it\u2019s mostly played for laughs. The only issue is it\u2019s not actually funny. I get that in animation you can do all sorts of wacky physical humor due to the lack of physical bounds, but that\u2019s what makes it all the more boring. \\n\r\nThere\u2019s a reason we no longer see the whole \u201crunning off a cliff, looking at the camera and THEN falling\u201d gag in animation. Physical humor in animation isn\u2019t easy to pull off because it\u2019s such a clich\u00e9d field. \u201cOh the character makes a wacky face and yells and jumps around!\u201d Hasn\u2019t been funny in 60 years, show. Stop using it for 6/10ths of your punchlines. \\n\\n\r\n\u2026\\n\\n\r\nRegardless. She cries and cries until our protagonist says some generic recycled shounen drivel about \u201cbelieving in yourself and having hope for humanity\u201d, then she cries some more. \\n\\n\r\nYes. We get it. She\u2019s a weak, dumb character. Hilarious and awesome! \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nRelationship: \\n\\n\r\nThe headline of this show is the relationship between our main character and his sister. I've seen so many people just gushing over how dynamic and interesting this relationship, however, I just didn't see it. As I said above, his sister is quite literally just the same as him except she's a deadpan Loli. \\n\\n\r\nTowards the final arc of the show we finally got some deviation between the two, the sister being more calculating and less emotional. While our protag is less calculating and more emotional. But at that point its been ten episodes and extra characterization feels tacked on, especially since these characters are so constantly NOT evolving. \\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship never goes past \"cute and simple\". So I find it hard to praise a show on that. Especially since it does weave into fanservicey at times, with his sister being exploited similarly to the other girls on the show. While our protagonist isn't so keen on seeing her naked, its still a line this show teasingly tries to cross. \\n\\n\r\nThing is, this fan-service is just not too good... and no, i'm not talking about the actual nakedness of the girls or the camera angles in which they are filmed. That's mostly subjective, if you like 2D eleven year olds then all the power to you. I'm talking about context to fan-service, especially in regards to their relationship. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nIf fanservice, and by fanservice I mean purposefully titillating scenes, are mandatory. Then you might as well try to weave them into the narrative. I want to say that the show does try to do that but it does it in such a corny and half-assed way that I can't help but feel like its patronizing. \\n\\n\r\n\"So these characters have to get to know each other, lets throw them into a bathhouse cause then there'll be funny physical humor where the flat-chested loli is embarrassed that she is flat chested! That's NEVER been done before!\" \\n\\n\r\nNow compare that to something like Monogatari's fanservice and you see the stark and obvious difference between the two. But i'm not trying to constantly compare this to something like Monogatari. I'm trying to point out how fanservice can be a part of the story, or how fanservice can be tacked on because the show needs to market these characters somehow. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nI won't even touch on how sexualizing an eleven year old is weird. This is anime, this happens constantly. I'm not pretending like this is the first show to do this kind of creepy shit. But if you are going for creepy shit, at least put effort into said creepy shit. Make it extra creepy and spicy. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAnimation : \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo lets talk animation. Above I mentioned that it is in fact well-animated. And it is. It honestly has some really solid animation throughout. There is a lot of movement and said movement is pretty fluid and entertaining. I actually was fairly impressed by how well animated the entire show is. \\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is another, wholly subjective field i'll mention. It's not really my thing. The entire show is over-saturated and incredibly colorful. To the point where it's almost blinding. Even during the a certain episode where half of it is in black and white, the show still feels very blinding in its color.\\n\\n\r\nThis is most definitely a stylistic choice. I just don't like that stylistic choice. It makes the show hard to watch for extended periods of time. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nI've spoken enough about how uninspired every character in this show is. Every character is a design I've seen multiple times before. There's literally nothing I can say about the design positively. Its either generic as hell or bad. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nTHE mostly POSITIVES : \\n\\n\r\n         -The Story : \\n\\n\\n\r\nHere's where we get into things that I was decently impressed by. While the story beats are as generic as they come, the games which these characters do play are all pretty well fleshed out and engaging. Engaging in the most basic way, sure, but engaging nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nThe show pretty much takes a popular game, whether its a board game or anything else, and adds its own spin on it. The spin is generally overly complicated and kind of illogical, but regardless... here we are. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason for this illogical and emotional spin on things is to once again service our protagonist and make him out to be the best at everything. Sure his little sister is a logical beast and can calculate just about everything, but it doesn't really matter since EVERY game doesn't service that. And every game doesn't service that not because the world in the show is like that, but because the writers wrote it like that. This makes a lot of the reasoning feel stilted. \\n\\n\r\nSpecifically a twist on the Japanese board-game, Othello, was so contrived, dumb, and unnecessary that it spoiled an otherwise fine episode. So put bluntly, this show feels like its fighting against itself with these games. Sometimes they are creative and visually pleasing, albeit nonsense. Other times they are just nonsense. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nIn the shows finale a whole new world is created, and while the showdown isn't nearly as entertaining as the showdown mid-way through the show, its still decently put together. Here our characters face off against one of the two girl archetypes: \\n\\n\r\n[Big Boobied idiot]\\n\\n\r\n[Flat-chested soft-spoken loli] <--- This one\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I will say that the conclusion overall is fairly well put together. The ending didn't feel sure of whether it'll get a second season or not, which made it seems a bit lame. But the actions before that were serviceable and were most likely some of the strongest moments in the show. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is a bit more political than usual, which adds a certain sense of wonder. I guess. The world being fairly generic doesn't help. There's this sense that this show wants to feel as though its parodying itself, but it really doesn't pull it off. On occasion there are one liners that are fairly like-able and create for more engaging dialogue in-between the action, but for the most part the story is split up between three sections. \\n\\n\r\nThere's exposition, fanservice, and action. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen I was just beginning to become interested in film and the entertainment industry, my father and I would constantly talk with each other about objectivity and subjectivity in film. When I was younger I never really liked or truly understood what he was saying. \\n\\n\r\nHe has years and years in the film industry and obviously knows the way things work. However, i'd always argue with him about story elements. Whether a certain story was good or bad and why. He'd always reply the same way though. \\n\\n\r\n\"Well, how did the film do in the box office?\" This always annoyed me because i'd say, \"It doesn't matter, Dad, we're talking about the story!\" And then he'd respond the same way. \\n\\n\r\nThis is because at the end of the day entertainment is made for the people. Regardless of how much hatred something like the Transformers movies get constantly, they still make billions in the box office. People always go to watch them and they keep going. So clearly the films aren't 'bad\", are they? \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nIf we are talking about objective success, in regards to story, delivery, characters, anything. That objective success lies in what the audience thinks of something. How they respond and how they engage with the material. If that response is plentiful and positive then that piece of entertainment is an objective success.\\n\\n\r\nMy father would tell me that I need to understand this if I ever want to succeed in the industry. Sure there are niche markets. Arthouse films are a perfect example. But the most successful and recognizable arthouse films and shows are the ones that succeeded in becoming popular in that niche market. So at the end of the day every single piece of media that can be seen as objectively good is one that succeeds in its demographic. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nWhat i'm trying to say is at the end of the day i'm wrong about this show. I may not like it because it does everything I hate about anime. And anime does a lot of things I hate. The reason it does all those things I hate is because that's the market. The market its appealing to is my least favorite market in the entertainment business. However, it's doing it well since look how damn popular this show is. Look how good the reviews are!\\n\\n\r\nSo at the end of the day, i'm very wrong. Sure my opinions are backed up by some resemblance of logic, but that doesn't make them accurate in the long term. The best I can do here is understand why this show got so popular. Its the definition of escapist entertainment and that's fine. \\n\\n\r\nI may not like it because it feels shallow and boring. But to others it doesn't. This is what they want. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nSo this show is perfectly just there. I watched it and I'll most likely forget most of the characters and plot. It follows a very obvious archetype and there really is no tension built in this show. Every problem is almost immediately solved. \\n\\n\r\nThis is escapism at its most blatant and that's not a bad thing. \\n",

            "content": "All right, my first review i actually care about and put forth some effort!\r\nNo game no life is in my opinion one of the best and will have you excited from the start to the very end. Unlike most similar anime this one is quick moving and keeps you on your toes and interested.\r\nSTORY: sora and shiro come from a world similar to modern Japanese society to a world that\u2019s a giant game board with 15 other races and a much more interesting god who is not afraid to get involved. Every conflict in this world is determined by games whether it\u2019s who sleeps onthe floor all the way up to who gets be the one true god. Upon arrival the two find that the imanity race (practically the same as the human race) has lost almost all of its land and will most likely die out soon. Upon seeing this sora and shiro decide to do the right thing and help save imanity... NOT! Those two just want to play the games.\\n\r\nIt seems like every episode is better than the last and that\u2019s especially true for the 12th episode. I will admit there were a few dull moments however it turns out those moments where very important. Some things can easily be missed if you don\u2019t know what they are talking about BUT it\u2019s explained a few seconds later. When all is said and done it seems to be unique but it sadly is not. It bears a striking resemblance to \u201cMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nART: the art style is that of something I have never seen or at least rarely. They used bright colors and lighting a lot to ethicize the mood. Of course you should not care much about art unless it\u2019s really bad (it\u2019s not) or you\u2019re an artist (I am not). Backgrounds are well done and I have not seen a flaw like two left hands yet. Animation is clean and smooth as expected.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: OSTs or Original Sound Tracks are an important part of any anime. The fight song must be perfect and match an anime or else the fight is just meh. The timing and music was well done and fits great with the animation and mood of scenes. My biggest hope is that if they dub this series they use good voice actors like they did in the raw/subbed.\\n\r\nThe OP is pretty badass in my opinion; it\u2019s one of my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: sora and shiro sibling NEETs who are the best at gaming. Sora is the half of blank (the group of shiro and sora that is undefeated in all games) that is the best strategist and cold reader. Shiro on the other hand makes up the other half of blank that is the best at puzzles, information and calculations. These characters are not perfect no matter how much people insist they are. For example, what happens when the two are separated. They come close to losing many, many times and that\u2019s just how they like to play. I would say they are well developed for the 12 episodes of time.\\n\r\nStephanie and jibril are the other two characters worth mentioning. These two are decently developed but could use some more development; as for everyone else in the series, well\u2026 almost no real development there or air time. But that\u2019s OK, it\u2019s about sora and shiro and not tet.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: at this time please go to the stats tab and check out currently the chances you will like this anime, Chances are most likely high. There is a reason for that and it\u2019s not because it a comedy or has the ecchi genre. This is a good story and I thoroughly enjoyed it to the point that I was saving it at the same time as watching it every week. There is no doubt in me that a second season is coming and I pray soon because this is too good to become another \u201celfen lied\u201d or other great ones that never got another season.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, I gave it a 10/10 for a reason.\\n",

            "content": "No Game No Life is an interesting anime, making good use of its short, twelve-episode span. The plot is engaging, light-hearted, and most importantly, fun. The two protagonists, Sora and Shiro, are likable and their personalities ground the fantastic elements of the show while propelling the plot forward at a stable and captivating pace. Some scenes are punctuated with awkwardness, normally in reference to the sibling duo, but the show subverts these complaints with its buoyant attitude toward its characters and themes.\r\n\tNo Game No Life is a vibrant anime, and it uses this effect to its own advantage, taking serious and problematic themes from thereal world, and portraying them in and through the effervescent world and personalities that populate the show. Unrecognized potential, social frustrations and anxiety, loneliness, helplessness, and an inability to find one\u2019s place in the real world are all at play in the show, but each dilemma is faced with an air of sincere levity, almost a tongue-in-cheek passivity. The show seems to at once understand these feelings, while also providing the perspective of maturity, acknowledging that sometimes these emotions can only exist in the vacuum that humans create for themselves. \\n\\n\r\nJoining these overarching themes are the institutions of governments, politics, and war; the great powers that be, affecting each individuals\u2019 lives, normally without their consent. The twist of the show is that Sora and Shiro have been transported to a magical world where everything is decided by games, even citizenship and country borders. By relegating these stressful, sometimes morbid, affairs into the modest and innocent format of games, the show is able to handle mature thematic ideas with an innocuous and child-like humor. Political struggles lose their dire edge when they are decided by a game of love tag, and rather than detracting from the experience, the show is able to relay these messages in more simplistic and subtle ways through the unimposing game structure. Simply put, the plot constrains complex ideas within easy-to-digest games, without every being overbearing; these aspects of the show exist, but it is easy enough to miss them amidst the audacious colors and excitable dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters in No Game No Life do a fine job of establishing their pre-defined roles, but Shiro and Sora steal the show, their chemistry and talents imparting a huge part of the entertainment the show provides. Both Shiro and Sora are capable protagonists alone, but together they thrive. Sora is endearingly arrogant and brash, able to back most of his claims and gambles with his well-devised plans and gaming expertise. Shiro is humble and reserved, acting as an immense font of intelligence necessary to brace Sora\u2019s elaborate schemes. Alone, it is obvious that neither of the siblings would be capable of the success that they achieve through their symbiosis, and watching them interact is a pleasant experience. It was a nice change of pace to see the two characters fully comprehend and accept their predicament and place in the new world, instead of trying to return to a reality they clearly had no part in. My only minor gripe is that more time was spent establishing their characters as opposed to developing them, but with only twelve episodes, the show could only do so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is as refreshing as the cheery plot, providing a peaceful and colorful ambience throughout the show. At some points, the artistic direction can be a bit glaring, with it looking like somebody smeared blue and pink cotton candy all over the screen, but the vivid colors were a welcome change of pace from the drab, dreary worlds of other anime, for the most part, at least. The lines were sharp and the character models were both emotive and expressive of each characters\u2019 personality; this is also noticeable in the non-imanity races. Speaking of the non-imanity races, of which there are fifteen, it would have been nice to see more of them, but considering there are more races than episodes, it is a forgivable omission.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was as pleasant as the visual spectacle presented in each episode, matching the color and mood the show presented. The opening song hovered between the light atmosphere and serious subject matter that the show tackled, blending nicely with the artistic and thematic direction.\\n\\n\r\nOf the few complaints I do have, the most notable would be the more ecchi elements at play. I have nothing against ecchi in and of itself, but when a show sports an eleven-year-old girl, I would prefer it if her clothes remained on. It isn\u2019t an issue that is large enough to subtract from the show\u2019s overall appeal and score, but it didn\u2019t leave me with a warm, fuzzy feeling either. Aside from that, the show\u2019s only real downside is its length, as I feel that if it had more time it could have expanded on the characters, games, and lore.\\n\\n\r\nNo Game No Life was a welcome surprise, easily worth watching. When the only major complaint I can level against an anime is that it wasn\u2019t long enough, it becomes easy to recommend. I wouldn\u2019t say that the story or characters are deep, and I didn\u2019t walk away from the show with a new appreciation for anime, but then that was never the goal in the first place. No Game No Life is fun and entertaining. What more does it need to be?",

            "content": "Before destroying that \"not helpful\" button, let me explain myself.\r\nI don't doubt at all that No Game No Life was a good anime, and definitely worth spending time to watch. It is arguably the best anime of 2014, first and second cour combined.\r\nHowever, it is also true that this receives too stellar reviews, and not to mention, too glamorized.\r\nAs always, absolutely no spoilers, but some of the terms used may suggest indirect minor plotlines.\r\nStory: 7\r\nI HAVE A POINT.\r\nIndeed it was a rare-sighted anime with a code geass genre. The setting of both the characters and the actual site are wonderfully done, not to mention theamount of brain works the anime used. It was not the usual \"mc wins because he's the mc\". The characters had to actually work in order to get what they wanted.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, overall, I have 3 scenarios in the anime to which I cut down the points for the story segment.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and the biggest disappoint was the othello game. It indeed had some interesting ideas that got me curious, but the author failed to deliver the feeling that the main characters had to fight to win. He seemed to show the \"main character wins because he/she's awesome shut up\" cliche, which disappointed me enormously since I was enjoying the anime over my head.\\n\\n\r\nSecond disappointment was the ending. It felt rushed, and not too ideally. Since at this point it is almost a certainty that this anime is going to get a sequel it isn't too big a problem that the ending was unsatisfactory, but nonetheless the hook for people to watch the sequel was too rash as it bore more questions than the rest of the anime did. The final episode alone could get several hot anime debates, and compressing all the foreshadowing and resolutiion into just one episode was honestly too much. If I were to clearly say what I'm disappointed in it'd be how the anime producers poorly divided and scheduled the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThird, and really more of a minor discomfort than disappointment was the complexity of the characters' conversations. This also has lot to do with the producers' problems, but some--mostly towards the end--of the explanations are unfriendly to the viewers and too complicated for the short span of time they are presented on.\\n\\n\r\nNormally all these would not make a huge deal as it cut off 3 whole points, but all these were presented towards the end, thereby enlarging the disappointment. If an anime is initially mildly disappointing but godly towards the end like FMA brotherhood, Clannad or Steins;Gate, the excitement and enjoyment doubles, but getting disappointing as the episode progresses leaves a long disappointment and lowers the value of the animation as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, being that the disappointment was not large enough to make me turned off from NGNL as a whole, I gave story 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nNGNL is one of the first anime with its art style. It wasn't \"one\" of Madhouse's tries--it wasn't \"one\" of any anime production company's tries. It was the first anime with this style.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, this turns off some viewers who is more concerned with artstyle than story or any other factors, which, in anime world, is quite a majority. Some people who like kyoani's style of unnecessarily detailed animation watches only those similar to it, such as A-1, Kyoani or J.C.Staff.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, Madhouse has a sort of \"alienated\" animation style, as they are either too beautified to the point that it is hard to recognize the lines and borders of the eyes or eyelashes. While many people don't find this too harsh an issue, some beginning animese would find this a little hard to ignore.\\n\\n\r\nBut this doesn't mean that the amount of graphics and details the production studio put on the anime was superb. The battle scenes were almost unnecessarily detailed, the skies looked almost real and the scenery--the scenery was good enough to bloom the entire animation as a whole. Sometimes I would find myself awing at the beautiful scenery that I miss some conversations between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, if a sequel came out with the same art, I would not hesitate to give a 9, or even a 10, but since this was the first try of the Madhouse, I cut off a huge portion of the art segment.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis. Game. Was. One. Of. The. Best. Openings. OF. ALL. TIME.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my most liked singers so far, Suzuki Konomi, showed what she could do at her best. I couldn't skip through the intro like I usually did with other anime and listened through all of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was spectacle as well. Ai Kayano was and still is hands down one of the best singing voice actors of all time. The song itself was fit for Ai Kayano's style of singing too, which embellished the quality of the voice.\\n\\n\r\nBGM's were naturally pieces of art too. Above all, they did their jobs. They created a sense of danger when they needed to, sense of comedy when they needed to and sense of height when they needed to.\\n\\n\r\nBut above all, the quality of voice actors the anime used!\\n\\n\r\nFirst in the line we have Ai Kayano, one of the best voice actors for silent characters, playing Shiro, a silent little girl. We have Matsuoka playing Sora, who needed to play the idiot's role, straight man role and the devil with human's mask role, and through Sorata from Sakurasou and Kirito from SAO, he has proven his worth in all three roles. Another small girlish boy was done by the well-known Kugimiya Rie, a girl with gap was done by a hysteric expert, Iguchi Yuka and another silent yet somehow fearsome girl was done by Noto Mamiko, expert in silent ghostly characters.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, the people who watched Sakurasou knows that Matsuoka and Ai Kayano played Sorata and Mashiro from Sakurasou, respectively, which is a laugh since in NGNL they played Sora(ta) and (Ma)Shiro.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nFor a short, 12-episode anime, it is best to keep the number of casts to minimum since it gets difficult to follow and develop them if there was a huge number, and NGNL follows this rule perfectly as it only casts 11 characters, side characters included.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I gave only 8 even at that was in the unsatisfactory development of Miko and Kurami.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the othello game, Kurami seems to be given an important role, but her development is replaced with fanservice. This is also a character development in its own way, but even still, she wasn't given as much a development as the story seemed to develop her.\\n\\n\r\nBut this could have been easily ignored.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem was in the unsatisfactory development of Miko.\\n\\n\r\nShe almost seems to be the last boss of the series, but in the end, she gave in too quickly and showed no behind stories, pasts, goals or anything on those lines, and acted in the cliched \"kind ruler who becomes mc's ally\".\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the rest of the characters were developed quite nicely, especially the main characters. The producers and author succeed in telling the viewers that they have more to them than just cliched main characters who won't lose no matter what. Stephanie Dora, another main character, also proved to be more than what she conveys to be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned at the beginning, this is undoubtedly the best anime of 2014 so far. It manages to rouse all the necessary points of a good anime, with a little disappointment that almost can be forgiven at the breathtaking battles of the main characters that involves not a giant sword or an almighty power but brain and strategy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5 to 9\\n\\n\r\nEven if I said all these, there are differences in people's opinions on an anime. While some people enjoy a dark story where it tells the root of humans, some people enjoy an anime where a boy is surrounded by beautiful girls. Some people like anime where main characters are almighty and some people like anime where main characters are weak. A good anime is an anime that makes all these different viewers say in unison that \"it was good\".\\n\\n\r\nNo Game No Life is definitely for a lot of viewers. It has a sense of both the main characters' weaknesses and strengths, sense of ecchiness, sense of moe, and most of all, sense of a strategic fight. I cannot recommend this anime enough.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen this anime yet, go watch it. Don't mind what other people say about the anime and only mind whether you enjoyed it to your heart's content or not.\\n\\n\r\nThen, as always, happy anime-ing.",

            "content": "I'd like to mention that this is my first review, so it will most likely have flaws.\r\nStory - (9/10)\r\nThe story is pretty interesting and unique. It takes place in an alternative world, where everything is decided by games, pretty straightforward. Each episode transitions very well and the pace is spot on, doesn't feel too slow or rushed.\r\nThis show has fan service, but unlike most other ecchi anime, the fan service in this show is not a crucial part of this series. I think people who aren't much of a fan of fan service shouldn't have a problem with this show, as it is only anice addition.\\n\r\nThe ending does not conclude our main characters' adventure. Although it was satisfying, it was also incomplete, there is a lot more to come, which foreshadows potential sequels.\\n\\n\r\nArt - (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis series has an unusual color palette, some may like it and some may hate it. Personally I think it's fantastic, the colors are really vibrant and beautiful. The animation was smooth and remained like that from start to finish. The character designs are not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSound - (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors performed very well. Their voices matched the characters perfectly. The OP which is sung by Konomi Suzuki and the ED which is sung by Ai Kayano, the voice actor of Shiro, are masterpieces. I've actually purchased a digital copy of them. The OSTs were catchy, but not really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately this is a weak part of the show. Although all characters were quite likable, our main characters lack development, we don't know how Sora and Shiro met each other, or anything about their parents, we don't even know their last names, why are they so smart? (you can also call it overpowered). This will most likely be revealed later in a sequel or the light novels (if it hasn't been revealed already). But it was not revealed in this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI liked this anime a lot, the fact that Sora and Shiro always were able to stay calm and deal with every situation without panicking, even when the odds of winning were against them, was quite interesting. The lack of character development could be easily ignored. The art style was beautiful and simply an eye-feast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8.4/10 (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a fun experience with a unique story. Overall this show is simply spectacular. The lack of character development is nothing to take to heart as it barely affects the enjoyment of the series.",

            "content": "Story   -   6\r\nWell this show had a lot of hype, I can say. But I missed out on the hype and watched it after it finished. So this seems pretty old right, getting trapped in a world we've seen it in similar anime like sword art online. But this show has a twist they don't want to go back, and that where it all starts, the world they land in has 16 races and they have 10 rules and everything is decided by games. And what do these NEET's do they try take over the world! The story part of thisanime is pretty alright, but there are a few inconsistencies.\\n\\n\r\nArt  -  10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in this show is perfect for alternate/alien world type of show. The art is colorful with an emphasis on colorful, I don't think Ive seen an anime as colorful as this one. As expected of Madhouse they don't disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nSound  -  8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good, nothing really stands out except the background music, which is pretty catchy. Also the voice actor for Sora is perfect he is perfectly suited for the character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter  -  7\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint with the characters is that they are too OP and they didn't need the ecchi scenes. The characters seem fairly developed but they could've been more developed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  -  10\\n\\n\r\nNGNL was a fun show to watch, it had a few smart strategic games, and a wide variety of colors but they lacked logic and the characters seem too powerful, but even so they had me excited and it was very enjoying for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall  -  8\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is fun and a must watch. I gave it a 8 based on the mean of the scores i gave for the rest of them. As I am Always going to do.\\n",

            "content": "Preface: I'm sorry if I sound angry or mad in this response because I have talked about this show many times, and my hate goes FAR beyond me just thinking this is a bad show lol\r\nFirst, let me start off on why I think it's bad. \r\nStory: 1/10\r\nThe story contains more plot holes than I can count on my fingers and toes (EX. If Sora and Shiro had the previous king basically write them an instruction manual on the shooter game they played against the animal people, why did they freak out when they realized they were in the city? Surely the manual mentioned that.And don't even get me started on the cheating. Cheating is one of the only rules established, and yet everyone does it to the point where it's not even a game of skill or wit, but a competition to see who can cheat better. AND NO ONE EVER GETS CAUGHT) The games themselves are entertaining for the first 5 minutes, until we are bombarded with table turns. One minute, Sora and Shiro have a commanding lead, then the next they are helpless only to repeat this cycle man times throughout the entirety of the games. This wouldn't be as bad, however, if the main protagonists could lose, BUT THEY CAN'T. They literally say countless times throughout the show \"Blank never loses.\" I don't know about you, but I lost all interest after the constant repetition of \"Blank never loses.\" Oh, they're losing this chess game? Good thing \"Blank never loses.\" What's this? The opponent is cheating AGAIN (and surprisingly no one notices) WHAT'S COULD POSSIBLY HAP... Oh wait I almost forgot. \"Blank never loses.\" The games fell flat and became incredibly uninteresting because of this. It's also a fudging ecchi (and ecchi is my least favorite genre.) Need I say more on that? xD Lastly this show ends with a terrible \"read the light novel ending.\" When I got to the last episode, I found myself 100% DISsatisfied, and that in and of itself was enough to make me not like the show from the get-go. (It's my least favorite ending of ALL TIME) I would have loved to have heard or have seen more than 2 races, but I guess I'll have to read the light novel to do so (Spoilers: I'm not going to) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nThe characters are abysmal. Sora and Shiro have one driving factor, and that is to be kings of this world. Anything more? Any backstory? How did they meet? Why are they so good at games? Why doesn't Shiro wear a longer skirt, so there aren't as many pantyshots? (She's 11 btw) The show neglects to tell us all these things (especially the last one,) and the main characters are incredibly empty because of it. What about Jibril? Nothing to say there either. Same with that one elf girl and her former slave who's names escape me FOR SOME REASON (It's because they are irrelevant.) No backstory, no real driving factors, no development. Just plain, 2D cardboard cutouts. Notice I've saved the best for last. Steph. Steph is the worst character I've seen in anime to date. She is nothing but a fanservice device, she is the intermediary character who goes from smart to dumb just for the sake of relaying Sora and Shiro's thought processes to the audience (not like it matters considering Blank never loses) and has no backstory or development to speak of. All the characters are completely worthless to the point of not being able to call them characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nI will give credit where it's due, the art is really good. Great use of red outlines, but just a tad bit too bright for my liking. The game world looked great, and backgrounds were really well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe sound was good, as well with a fantastic opening, and great VA's\\n\\n\r\nSo that's why I think it's a bad show, but why do I hate this show so much?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: .05/10\\n\r\nBet you didn't think it went lower than a 1, did you? Well, I had to make an exception in this case. There is one reason besides everything mentioned above) why I dislike the show so much, and why it's my least favorite show of all time It's the fanbase. The people who have told me this utterly terrible show is good. Now, if you like the show, that's 100% fine. I can't argue with your opinions, and I think NO LESS of anyone who likes this show. But it's the countless arguments I've had with people who try to tell me this show is actually good. As you can see, I can back up my reasoning on why I think this show is bad because I've had to do this exact same thing many, MANY times. I've typed LOTS of paragraphs to people, and sometimes with a negative and condescending intent because I've been told by one of these people AND I QUOTE EXACTLY \"I am not going to lie I won't lie I am going to say this right now you are worthless please kill yourself this anime is in so many ways...\" (keep in mind I said nothing to this person prior to this comment on my review on my Youtube channel)\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to average my scores, it would be a 3.1 but this show doesn't deserve that.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's it. Sorry I ranted, and I mean no ill intent nor do I mean to be condescending to anyone in any way by anything I've said. And let me finish by saying again, I have no problems with anyone liking this show. Your opinion is just that, and I can't (and won't) hate you for thinking the way you do. I'm just plain hate it when people are condescending about me not liking it as much as I do, or try to tell me it's a good show xD",

            "content": "While I do hate to start this review off with a shameless plug, I do stress that my love for this anime can't simply be expressed in words, and if you have already seen No Game No Life, I highly recommend you to check out my reaction series of it on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLudLxRqlTVEjTHp4M96BuoORprQDt_9y5\r\nNow that my shameless plug is out of the way, I must express why I feel this is one of my favorite anime series.\r\nSTORY: 9/10\r\n(Contains spoilers of the first episode)\r\nNo Game No Life is an anime which focuses around two NEET's by the name of Shiro and Sora. These two are siblings andoften are arguably too close. They are infamous throughout the gaming community for being \"Blank\", a mysterious group of players who never lose regardless of any cheats used against them who gained that moniker because they never fill out a name for their characters.  They found life to be a crappy game and sought refuge within the world of games to run away from that cruel existence. Of course, in typical anime style, their entire lives would change.\\n\\n\r\nAfter an anonymous email leads to a hard fought chess game won by Sora and Shiro, the two and sucked into the world of Disboard, a world in which all manner of conflict is determined through games.\\n\\n\r\nWhat would ensue throughout the series is Sora and Shiro's adventures as they try to basically conquer the fantasy world of Disboard. Elves, Warbeasts, Flugel, and many other fantasic creatures will be met along the way, and much fanservice is to be had as well. No Game No Life is quite the journey that few will ever forget.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do find the art to be very beautiful, it isn't anything groundbreaking in anime and as such, I have little to say except it is very nice. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST for No Game No Life is simply epic. The opening theme (This Game by Konomi Suzuki) is one of the best I have ever heard, and the ending theme is very strong as well (Oracion by Ai Kayano). The BGM is very underrated in my personal opinion, with themes  such as \"All of You is All of Me\" and \"Reverse?\" (It's a freaking remix of Cornered 2001 from Gyakuten Saiban AKA Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. How in the world is it not going to be awesome?)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThey are very well portrayed and developed, plain and simple. You would agree if you have seen the show. It does not focus solely on Shiro and Sora either, many other characters get legitimate development, which is somewhat surprising considering this show is twelve episodes long barring a season two at some point down the line.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't enjoy this anime, we probably are nothing alike. This show has clever writing, a simple yet intricate story, wonderfully colorful and well developed characters, a great soundtrack, and even a bunch of fanservice for those who love that side of anime. No Game No Life is an experience I truly believe any anime fan casual or hardcore would enjoy immensely.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL GRADE: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't perfect, but it sure as heck is close.\\n",

            "content": "ATTENTION ALL FORCES!!!\r\nBy my authority as king,\r\nanyone who fights valiantly in this battle...\r\n...WILL EARN THE RIGHT TO BANG ANY GIRL THEY LIKE!\r\n- Sora (Episode 3, 2014)\r\nThis is probably the best anime so far in 2014, not only proven by statistics, but also by how its new style gives off such an refreshing feeling. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nFor starters, most people that get trapped in another world usually freak out and do everything they can to get back to their original world. Sora and Shiro on the other hand, they even point this part out, that they are not like the other people who do their best toreturn to their own world but to thrive in this new one. The story is filled with epic moments and plots twists that would make a person double over in laughter because of how hilarious and unexpected it is. Probably one of the most \"aweseome\" stories I've seen in a while. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nOne of the defining aspects of No Game No Life would definitely be its art. Its unique style emphasises on how important eyes are, and how they can be used to easily deceive people. The colour scheme has also been well done. The backgrounds are done wonderfully, giving a very splashy and exciting feel to the anime, modernizing it. The characters are also drawn out very carefully giving each and everyone of them a defining feature. Including the colours of their hair, eyes, you can easily distinct one character from another which is extremely helpful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nNo Game No Life opening and ending was absolutely amazing. It really gets to you. The electro music in the soundtracks and OST really gives it a futuristic feel. One of the best OSTs in this anime would be the one called \"Now Loading...\" not even kidding, the OST is called \"Now Loading...\". Well that doesn't surprise me since the opening theme song was called \"This Game\". Keep your eyes peeled for these ending and openings because in ONE of the episodes they actually \"alter\" the ending theme to match the story which was extremely thoughtful and well done. People who usually skip the openings and endings miss out on this so please keep this in mind while watching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nLike I have mentioned earlier, each of the characters have a distinct and unique trait which is not only defined by the artwork, but also by their personalities. To start it off, you have Sora, the brilliant virgin that loves his little sister but also wants a girlfriend. Then you have Shiro, the most kawaii 11 year old imouto that I have ever seen. (Kawaii = cute, Imouto = Little sister). The bond between Sora and Shiro is an odd one but odd in a good way. They have complete trust in one another and this anime emphasizes so heavily on how those two work together as one, together they form \"Blank\" (Kuuhaku). When those two are together as one, they are undefeatable.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThere was not a second in this anime where my eyes were not gleaming or filled with tears. Tears of laughter or even tears from something sad. This series was just brilliant. There was not a second that I didn't enjoy myself while watching this show. It was absolutely awesome. Its hard to express my enjoy without going asd;flkasjdf. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis was well done beyond expectations. Its exceeded everything I expected and went beyond that. I recommend this anime to all (except if you dislike ecchi, there might be a couple moments where you would feel uncomfortable.) Hope all of you can have feel the same enjoyment as I have from this series. Can't wait for the 2nd season.",

            "content": "No Game No Life follows brother sister duo Sora and Shiro. These two NEET's ( Not in Education, Employment, or Training.) have dedicated themselves to mastering the world of games. Not just one simple video game but all of them through clever tactics, manipulation and intellect. Together they form the online group named Blank, which received its name because their avatars names would be blank while they planned online. One day these pair receive a email that transports them to another world where everything is decided upon the outcome of the games played. Given a new lease on life Sora and Shiro go forth ona quest to challenge the ruler of the world, the god known as Tet. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the series is very interesting and provides watchers great moments of laughter and chin dropping awe as these two intellectual characters go about achieving victory. The stories depth is compounded by the amazing visuals and sounds that makes up Tet's game world. The story does take its time by adding in great moments of reference to pop culture and comedy which lightens up the mood at appropriate sections during the story which paces the season very well.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Sora and Shiro are only made better with their interactions with all the supporting characters.Their dialogs with Stephanie and Jibril further the story and the attachment watchers will develop to the characters throughout season. All the characters that watchers encounter within this series will leaves a great lasting impression and serve to bring them even further into the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the season has only gotten me (and I'm sure many others) very excited for what's to come for the series. I highly recommend giving this a watch if you enjoy intellectual and comedic anime.",

            "content": "Whenever popular animes like Sword Art Online, Shingeki no Kyojin, etc. have aired, I am always late to the party. I only ever began watching them after they have finished airing, or are almost complete, and after they have become popular.\r\nThis may not seem like that big of a deal, and it really isn't. But it's cool that I was finally able to start a show before it became a hit. I watched episode 1 the day it aired. And I loved this anime all the way through.\r\nStory (9/10): This show has a pretty great story that grabbed my attention from the start. I'm notsure if the idea of conflicts being decided by games has been done before an anime, but even if it has, this show does it so well that it shouldn't matter. Nearly every episode of this anime interested me more than the last, and I think that is one of the things that made it so amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was written very intelligently. I actually had to pause sometimes to try and understand what Sora had actually done to win a game.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9.5/10): The art is excellent in this show. It has a unique animation, but it is still very attractive. Everyone has a unique design and is pleasing to the eyes. I found the coloring to be a bit odd, but this isn't a bad thing. In fact, I actually liked the unique color palette that this show had.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals during the Opening and Ending Theme are also excellent and part of what made me love those themes so much.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): This is one of the strongest points of the anime. Each episode gave me a goddamn eargasm! Not only are the voice acting and sound effects in the show fantastic, but the soundtrack... \\n\\n\r\nThe Opening Theme is sung by my beloved Konomi Suzuki. (who sings the Ending Theme of Sakurasou no Pet na Konojo \"Days of Dash\" along with having vocals in Watamote's OP. Both of which are also heaven for my ears.) I automatically love any song that includes this woman's voice, but her voice isn't the only amazing thing about the Opening. There is also that fantastic piano at the beginning. Listen to the full OP and download it on your iPod/MP3/Phone and you will not regret it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ending Theme I somehow like even more. They managed to make an Ending Theme that I liked more than the Opening Theme. I'm not sure how it was possible, but they did it. It is one of the catchiest songs I have ever heard. Every episode I looked forward to hearing this song at the end. I was kind of sad that they didn't play it at the end of the last episode. I also highly recommend downloading the full version of this.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST itself is also fantastic. It does a great job of not only fitting in with the atmosphere of the show, but making it even more intense during Sora and Shiro's games.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9.5/10): Sora ended up being on of my favorite male protagonists in anime. He is extremely badass, and his strategies are extremely well-thought out. I also am a fan of his pervertedness, as it made him more relatable for me, as well as adding to the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nShiro is a cute loli character, who is also extremely lovable. She is more quiet and speaks in short sentences, and that just adds to her charm. She is my second favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nStephanie is my third favorite character. She seems to be less popular than Jibril, but for some reason she had something very waifu about her that was attractive to me.\\n\\n\r\nJibril is pretty funny, and a nice addition to the cast. But I never got as attached to her as I did the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does not have a big main cast, which I think is actually a good thing. It allowed me to get more attached to the characters that were there, instead of having me struggle to remember everyone's name until I got to episode ten.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): Each episode was very addictive to watch: From the comedic moments, to the intense games, to figuring out what Sora and Shiro did to win a game. This anime was made so fantastically, that I was hooked after episode one. Thankfully, I watched this show as it aired, so I didn't end up watching four episodes a day and finishing it in three days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10): My fifth favorite anime, behind Angel Beats!, Toradora!, Clannad, and Clannad: After Story. I have a feeling this show will cling to that fifth place spot for awhile. I was really surprised by how much I ended up loving this show, and how it was able to surpass FMA: Brotherhood as my fifth favorite. It truly is a wonderful anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo their ends my fanboy-sounding review of No Game No Life. Please do not be turned off by this show just because it is popular. At least give it a try. If you somehow don't like it, I don't know what to say. But hopefully you love it!",

            "content": "If three words can be used to sum up No Game No Life (NGNL) in a nutshell, the three words would be games, strategy and girls. No Game No Life, despite enjoying it highly for its suspenseful ambiance, has its set of flaws like any other existing show. \r\nThis anime fills in the void for those relatable to the main characters, it built an imaginary euphoric world where the audience can enjoy No Game No Life\u2019s high excitement and enjoyment rate. \r\nSet in a fantasy world after having the two main characters Sora and Shiro transported there by a boy god named Tet, the seeminglyvirtual world immediately becomes the apparent reality. Being the hardcore shut-in NEETS they are, they utilise gaming for a sense of escapism where gaming is their reverie and their space of euphoria.\\n\\n\r\nIn this alternate fantasy based world, everything is based and decided by games. A fitting and suiting world for Sora and Shiro who spend most of their time gaming, almost as if the world was made just for them. In a world with sixteen known races and only ten rules to abide to, the siblings eventually play to save their inferior race, the Imanity. Only having one city left, Elkia, they aim to save Imanity and create a better place for Imanity. \\n\\n\r\nKnown as the legendary gamers, \"Blank\", together they are an unbeatable duo. Sora, brother of Shiro, the central protagonist is also a manipulative, scheming, intelligent, strategic and extroverted boy adolescent in the field of games. Despite his status of a shut-in, he speaks better and is more outgoing than the average perceived and archetype NEET. Instead, he is depicted almost as the paradigm of an omniscient and omnipotent commander in games. On the other hand, Shiro the sister of Sora is just as omniscient and omnipotent in the field of games. She is shown as a loli prodigy who also uses fanservice to appeal to the masses. The two cannot live without each other and need to be close to each other, a certain distance, in order to remain sane. Both characters implement a lot of comedy and humour into the show, giving the show a very lively and vivacious atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nAn aspect that makes NGNL so intriguing and distinct from many other stuck-in-the-virtual-gaming-world anime is that instead of attempting to escape back into the real world, Sora and Shiro choose the opposite, to stay in this alternate fantasy world evidently built for the siblings, a world better than the \"crappy game\" reality they live in prior being sent, a world they can truly enjoy as committed hikikomori gamers.\\n\r\nDespite the ecchi tag on NGNL, fanservice is not prime and does not cause much of a bother, instead it appeals to a number of viewers. Be it panty shots or oppai shots, the already-98%-female-composed-cast blend humour and fanservice together to create substance to the show. To any male, especially Sora the openish pervert, this is a paradise. That being said, NGNL\u2019s excitement and enjoyment level isn\u2019t heavily hindered ad obstructed by the implemented fanservice scenes and this is a facet worthy of praise. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is medicine for the human eye. The art utilises bright and vibrant colours to make the fantasy world distinct from the real world, a smart move by Madhouse. Being bright and vibrant as it is, it lights up the mood and portrays how this fantasy world is a much better place for the main characters Sora and Shiro, a surely fitting place where the gamers can enjoy, instead of the dull reality as it is simply a \u201ccrappy game\u201d. A unique extract from the show worthy of mention would be Episode 9 and this episode explores Shiro and how broken her world is without the brother she loves so much. Madhouse utilises black and white visuals for various extracts in the episode to add on to this effect, showing how much her life is composed of Sora, her dear brother.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the show is superb; it is sexual pleasure for the ears. The opening song \u201cThis game\u201d by Konomi Suzuki is a great piece of music that prepares the audience with its fast pacing and high vocals. The fast paced soundtracks pump the audience with adrenaline circulating throughout the body into a powered-up mechanism of charisma, adding on to the excitement and exquisiteness of the show. The ending song is a piece of music I personally have been attracted to since its first use. The song leaves an episode with excitement and prepares the viewers for the next episode of enjoyment with high pitched vocals and catchy tune. The background music in the show was evidently outstanding especially during each game, it pumps up and fires up the audience as well as the characters in the show and creates suspense and tension. Sympathetic and emotional soundtracks were also incorporated into the show during appropriate scenes and helped delivered the necessary emotions the main characters were feeling. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the main issues I have with the show is that it could have been better with more episodes dedicated to show the siblings\u2019 back-story and how they deal with their daily life in the real world so that we as the viewers can understand and sympathise with them as to why they despise reality so much. Moreover, another crucial point to consider as a flaw is the ending. Despite that the ending leaves hope for a season 2, it deters off viewers who do not like unsatisfying or incomplete endings. As the ending leaves off hope for subsequent sequels, it is satisfying to a number of people as being a one cour show definitely meant the story would not be able to end properly without rushing and butchering the source material which I am glad it did not. This allowed the pacing to be done properly and appropriately. As there are other races left to be screened, hoping for sequels is only natural as the show does the source material justice by leaving the ending in a cliffhanger state.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, No Game No Life is a pleasant and enjoying ride, a lovely sight, and a beautiful and thrilling experience. If you want something that will keep you leeched to your chair, this is your meal. No Game No Life is definitely a show that will be remembered, not because of the hype, but because of its intrinsic uniqueness and value. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s begin the game!\u201d- Sora and Shiro~\\n\\n\r\n#gamerlyfe",

            "content": "Welp here's a show thats about two siblings who are godly at video games, they're unbeaten and are known simply as (     ) a.k.a 'blank'. Badass right? Well for a linear story this show is enjoyable AS HELL. It does have a bunch of problems but something about this show is so enjoyable you don't wanna stop watching it. Not an enjoyable type where its a GODLY show. (sorry for using the term godly a bunch it just sounds badass)\r\nStory: \r\nSo the story starts off with Sora and Shiro, two siblings who are so good at games that they are unbeatable.They get challenged by this person really is, at a game of chess, yes chess, not checkers, not WOW, Chess.  And of course they win cause they're hackers I mean so gewd. The other person all of the sudden is actually the god of a new world (who is putting sora and shiro in) and this world is a world were everything is settled by games. I mean anything like e.g. wanna take this guys pantsu pictures? Play a simple game against them.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \\n\r\nThe animation is just.... to sum it up in two words Colorful and BUUUUUUUUUTIFUL! The background is filled with luxious colours and vast enviroments. Its bright and filled with colour. If you're just about to watch this from a show with dark and grey coloured animations this is a fresh breathe of air from that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is very well done and easily fits the tune of the show. Its moving, fast, inspirational and fast! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nYou have 3 main characters in this show, first you have Shiro, a 18 year old and more of the MAIN, Shiro can be a pervert at times but other than that we don't know too much about him, all we really know is that he's a virgin *chuckles* nice one show *high fives creator of show*. Then you have Sora, a 11 year old smartass. Later on we find out she was actually adopted and didn't say her first word till she was adopted by Shiro's parents and by that time, she was still a smartass and she was 5 DAYUM! Also she can be cold at times. The bad thing about Sora is that she isn't respected as much as a main character. And easy evidence of this is the first time we ever see her in the 1st episode we see her pantsu.... did I mention she's 11? And finally we have Stephanie, at first she's seen as this tryhard biatch who's dumb as hell but then we find out she's actually really fricking smart but still does dumb stuff. She's the king's grandaughter of one of the countrys which is the lowest ranks in that world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis show is enjoyable as hell as I said in my introduction. For some reason you actually wanna see the MCs win even though they're unbeatable. A lot of their wins are close calls but seeing them nearly lose breaks your heart a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nNo Game No Life is a good anime thats really enjoyable. If you have time to pass or really bored watch this show! A 2nd season hasn't been announced but we all know its coming because the ending of this show was a cliffhanger. For a show that I've given a 7/10 this would easily go in my Top 10 Anime of 2014. Without the art, sound or humor this show would've have been just OK. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever since Masao Maruyama and some of the other founders left the studio, Studio Madhouse has had an interesting time trying to recuperate. 2014 in particular was a bit of an interesting year for them. The critically acclaimed Hunter x Hunter came to a close, and they decided to adapt two Light Novel series to mixed effect. At this rate, I'm sure that some of you are aware of how much of a dumpster fire Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is, but what about this show? Let's cut straight to the chase: \r\nGames are fun. They are really, really fun, especially video games. Unfortunately, the realworld isn't always that fun, nor is it as vibrant. Isekai Light Novel series seem to be the epitome of dull, but it seems that this series (No Game No Life) wants to give it a gaming edge to make it vibrant and fun, as well as become a contender in the \"stuck in a game world\" anime market. I'm not necessarily familiar with the LN, but Madhouse decided to adapt this into an anime. Back to the series' goal. Did it fulfill? Did it make a vibrant and fun Light Novel adaptation that stood out from the rest? Did it make a good \"stuck in a video game\" anime? Well, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLong ago, 16 races took part in this grand war, until a new god named Tet barged in and made it so that all conflict is decided by games rather than violence. Now, onto the present. Aside from how the process of being transported into this fantasy world (without an official name as far as the anime's concerned) being unexplained and probably akin with the trappings of other anime that try this stunt (without proper logic attached to the actual act of trapping), there isn't a lot horribly wrong here. After Sora lands (with his sister, thanks to their gaming prowess in the real world), he slowly starts his non-violent conquest of the world, from Elkia to the Eastern Federation and hopefully beyond. It doesn't really go that far in 12 episodes, so, with any luck, there might be a continuation to adapt more of the story, especially since the finale so far is rather meh, cool final fight aside. The quality of the events in the 4 major games varies, but is generally a bit rough, but I'll get to that once I talk about the rules of this \"world\".\\n\\n\r\nThe rules of the world are poorly explained, despite how incessantly Sora tries to shove them down our throat, as if we forget after every episode. Later on, it ends up turning into a plot-hole addressed by a companion named Jibril (via the power of semantics), only for it to never be rectified. The way the first big game is won (in episode 4) is a total ass-pull as well, with there being a reference to how tyrannical kings are assassinated, only for the girl playing as king to abruptly lose for the sake of letting that statement be relevant without anything making it happen. Episode 5 is mainly infuriating filler sh*t that's truly meant to drag Stephanie (the very first female companion Sora receives in the new world) into the dirt. With game 2 (episode 6), you can name any word you want, and with that, there are so many possibilities (and both competitors come up with some creative strategies), but with every possible word at their finger-tips, inevitably, so many easy solutions to end the game are unused for the sake of entreatment value. Sure, it would't be fun to end important duels immediately (Right, Mahouka?), but if there are plenty of easy solutions either side can use to win, it makes no sense why Sora needed to come up with this convoluted plan to win, as cool as it is. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7 is some forced drama and development between the bond between Sora+Shiro, and Stephanie, even if the bond is quite a vitriolic one, and episode 8 is set-up for the final 4 episodes of the anime. Game 3 (episode 9) is convoluted as hell in every way imaginable, and it comes across as ridiculous in all the wrong ways, to put it lightly and in a spoiler-free light. The forced backstory for Shiro (Sora's sister and gaming partner) doesn't help matters either. The final game (episodes 11-12), minus a few holes in how Sora's plan is meant to be executed, is actually pretty entertaining and full of twists that lead up to a crazy climax, even with a cheesy as hell moment afterwards and a poor attempt at narrative stakes for the final competitor to hold which pushes her to win. Now, if only the finale after that was as interesting, but when there is  a \"READ THE MANGA\" ending, is it even possible for that type of ending to be satisfying?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSora is quite the bombastic OP gamer with a burning passion for video games, perverted stuff, and weeb sh*t. It's sort of fun seeing what scheme he comes up next, as if he were a lighthearted gamer version of Lelouch from Code Geass...with none of the depth. Still, some occasional and hilarious moments and flaws get shown front and center to make sure that he isn't just some Mary Sue (or Gary Stu in his case). He's easily the best character in this show. His sister, Shiro, is an 11 year old who gets a disturbing and unpleasant amount of panty shots for her age, and is generally more stoic and deadpan. She is equally perverted, but is far inferior to her brother in terms of everything, and the forced backstory doesn't truly boost her character. I do like the quirk abut the two siblings going into withdrawal when separated. Stephanie s a beautiful and studious woman who is cripplingly poor with games. Too bad the anime only really treats her as an idiotic sex-doll meant for ecchi moments, considering her personal baggage with the life she spent with her now deceased grandfather. It's infuriating how horribly Sora and especially Shiro treat her.\\n\\n\r\nJibril initially has this quirk of being turned on every time she gets the chance to seek out new knowledge, but is immediately a total kiss-up to Sora and Shiro following their victory. Still, this beauty has some vanity and funny moments. Zell is a mediocre character that puts up this mysterious aura before being revealed as just an insecure and borderline snobbish character, who only truly gets along with Fil (or FI, as she calls her), who despite seeming and acting like a delicate person (she is to Zell, anyway), she is surprisingly cold and full of grudges against Jibril due to actions in this grand war prior to Tet showing up and making everything solved by games. Speaking of Tet, he's basically an indifferent child who finds Sora's antics fun and wait for Sora to earn the right to challenge him. Everyone else is honestly even more plain than some of the weaker ones here, and with how may there are, there really is no point in mentioning them. Not  bad cast, but there was room for better development over the course of the 12 episode run.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is so much going on in so many of these shots, the art often looks very compact and busy, which is a real feat to pull off. The world is vivid and vibrant as well, with a bright color palette, and lighting that often compliments the shiny colors, even if it can be borderline blinding at times. What makes the lighting work here instead of in Mahouka is that unlike Mahouka (which slaps on bright lighting despite it being ill-fitting), No Game No Life uses it with a sense of style that truly compliments the fantasy video game world, giving it some character, unlike, say, the fantasy world in Re:Zero or Sword Art Online. There are spectacularly beautiful moments here in terms of pretty visuals, and the animators at Studio Madhouse deserve to be commended for it. Sure, it has that bad LN default character design look, and there is one scene with horrendous CGI, and the character models can look off in some moments, but this is overall a commendable work in terms of visuals.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis Game, by Konomi Suzuki, is a pretty engaging OP that truly captures the vibrant and fantasy-like setting the characters are in, and it's a strong OP overall with impeccable visuals to match. The ED, Oracion, by Ai Kayano (voice of Shiro) is honestly a mediocre ED despite the semi-interesting beginning. The actual OST is pretty mediocre as well, with not even one song standing out at all. As for the dub, it's an alright one. Sure, not every voice fits (especially for the lolis), but it's an acceptable dub overall, with Scott Gibbs giving a surprisingly fitting take on Sora. Neither the dub nor the music is impressive though, so that blows.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI can appreciate an anime that is mainly there to entertain, which is a trait not commonly seen in anime nowadays. I especially loved the references, even though I haven't been affiliated with their franchises. There are multiple Jojo references, an Evangelion reference, a Yugioh reference, an Ace Attorney reference, and judging by the way the ships in one moment in episode 11 look like, even a Legend of the Galactic Heroes reference, too. There are even more (including a Skyrim reference), but you get the point.You can legitimately make a game out of this, and I can appreciate an anime for doing this for us. Plus, it makes fun of some of the \"trapped in a video game\" and Isekai tropes. The games were also pretty entertaining and some of the comedy worked pretty damn well too. Unfortunately, nothing truly grabbed me despite this, not even the crazy and imaginative second game. Plus, the treatment of Stephanie ranged from comedic, to, more often, infuriating, and the one touching moment in episode 7 cannot truly make up for that. Still, I cannot deny I had fun with this anime, even if its more aggravating moments bog it down since it never truly captivated me.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10    RAW SCORE: 6.34/10\\n\\n\r\nInevitably, this anime would be compared to a similar series called \"Problem Children are coming from another world, aren't they?\". Honestly, that one was overall, about as entertaining but with none of the aggravating moments or characters. On its own, this anime was a decently fun and visually captivating ride, even if most of the characters weren't so great, and the plot didn't stack up so well. The anime isn't great, as the weak stability of the story has proven. Either way, this anime clearly succeeded at playing up its references and just having fun, and I bet it got a lot of people to check out the original Light Novel. Well, with that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "tl;dr: NGNL's plot starts off really good, but is plagued with filler. The characters are generally developed well and are interesting. The artstyle and animation are generally good but it honestly feels like I'm watching a DICE game made into an anime.\r\nI really liked No Game No Life at the start of the season. The show introduced the characters with solid backgrounds, personalities, and skills that are very consistent throughout the show. No Game No Life's strongest point is easily the characters, how they act, and how they were presented.\r\nWith these strong characters in place, the beginning of the anime also did very a goodjob of balancing character development, advancing the plot, and general humor. I gave this show's story a 3/10, why? Because the idea of, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\", doesn't apply for this show. Without spoiling anything, all I can say is that this show's Plot:Fanservice:Humor:Character Development ratios stayed more or less the same throughout the entire show. Also, a minor gripe I had is that, even though it was very well explained, I feel as if nearly every time they win, they're very close to losing and use some kind of plot magic strategy to explain their win. It was just a minor complaint of mine since halfway through the show, I basically expected them to nearly lose and then have something they mentioned (and foreshadow/emphasize HEAVILY) in the previous episode cause them to win.\\n\\n\r\nFocus on characters and creating a good mood for the viewer while setting up a basic end goal is necessary to keep the viewers attached to the show and gives them a reason to watch more than just the first couple of episodes. However, NGNL kept the exact same pacing for every episode, leading to A LOT of filler. While its true that all of the episodes advanced the plot in some way, I feel like only 5 minutes of each episode were needed to advance the plot, while the other ~15 mins were spent revisiting the already strong characters' attributes or just general nonsense that has no impact on the story at all.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the animation of the show was pretty good, but for some reason, they decided to add, for lack of a better term, bloom to every scene. I dunno, maybe it was some kind of ironic design choice making fun of popular games like Battlefield or Mirror's Edge.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty decent overall and fit the tone of the show, my main problem is they reused the same track over and over again, not a really big problem seeing as how its sort of like a MC victory theme, but for some reason, the repeated track(s) just didn't have as much of an impact as Kill La Kill's  themes did.\\n\\n\r\nSee tl;dr for overall opinion",

            "content": "No Game No Life is probably one of the most discussed Anime of the Season,\r\nso I'll say it clearly: This is my own oppinion, and it might differ from yours.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe Main Idea of living inside a game isn't new by any means.\r\nBut in contrast to most anime Shiro and Sora, our main Heroes have absolutely no interest of returning. I put a Liking to the idea. Its not the most complex story of all times, in fact its linear but nonetheless its a really good one.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nIt takes you exactly 17  seconds to realize that these artworks are awesome.\r\nThe picture of NGNL onMALs site is evidence enough. This style is something new and never seen before, but at the same time it reeks of greatness. Just as a short description of the style - very bright and vibrant colors, almost neon. Action scenes are fluent, character design is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\n'This Game' by Konomi Suzuki, as well as 'Oracion' by Ai Kayano are truly outstanding songs with high recognition value, and fitting perfectly to NGNL. To be honest, I'm hearing 'This Game' on loop almost everyday. I had goosebumps when I first heard it.\\n\r\nBGM wise NGNL is also top notch since every BGM hits the emotions it has to.\\n\r\nI don't need to mention it, but the Voice Actors fit their characters perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nNow starts the hairy part.\\n\r\nI know a lot of people resent the characters of NGNL. Well, I don't.\\n\r\nSora is an absolutely realistic NEET with way to much recognition value. I think thats one of the reasons people hate him. Because he's just like us male Otaku. A bit perverted, but completely confident in his skills.\\n\r\nShiro on the other hand is, as a genious, really hard to identify with. Well, thats kind of planned though. If he wanted to make a more approachable sister, Kamiya Yuu would simply have done that.\\n\r\nAs far as the minor characters go, all of their backgrounds are fleshed out, and there seems to be no reason to rant whatsoever. They have perhaps not that much development, but they certainly fullfill their role and are really likeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nEach and every episode I were on the edge of my seat.\\n\r\nWatching NGNL was the absolute highlight of my week. Full points desu~\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nSure, these aren't the best characters or story of all time, but both are decent.\\n\r\nDecent enough to recommend this anime to a choosen number of people.\\n\\n\r\nI think I need to describe what the 'choosen number of people' is though.\\n\r\nI read a lot of the NGNL reviews and I'm afraid, most of the people dislike how Blank always wins. To put it in the critics terms: 'How they pull victory out of their ass.'\\n\r\nTo be honest, none of Soras or Shiros actions are real surprises. I happen to be quite good with reading people, as well as planning several steps ahead, and, well, I personally understand why they do what they do. It's not a plothole, rather the watcher needs the instinct and skill to follow our main heroes actions.\\n\r\nSo, back to the main topic of 'choosen number of people': If you know a lot about strategy and the likes, for example by reading Sun Tsus 'The Art of War', if you know how to predict people as described in James Clavells 'Shogun' (executed by Yoshi Toranaga, a fictional version of Tokugawa Ieyasu), and if you can pay attention to minimal details, as recommended in detective stories like Detective Conan or Sherlock Holmes, you can understand the story.\\n\r\nIf you also happen to like some fanservice, good as well. Since there are also some humorous parts, you should be able to laugh and not take everything seriously.\\n\r\nIf you happen to have every of the aforementioned traits I seriously recommend you to watch NGNL. For everyone else its on own behalf.",

            "content": "No Game No Life Review:\r\nFirst, I want to get this out of the way. After seeing some mixed reactions to the score I gave Isshuukan Friends I want to address my scoring system quickly. To me, 5 is \u201caverage\u201d or maybe even slightly above. A 6 is good, and a 7 is great. A show in the mid to high 7 range is very often my pick for show of the season and most likely will end up in the top 10 for the year. Usually, there is only one or MAYBE 2 shows that get an 8 per year, and maybe 2 or 3shows will get a 9 or higher per decade. I know a lot of people see 7 as \u201caverage\u201d or \u201cokay\u201d but to allow more flexibility and the ability to distinguish between all the great shows I have seen better, I use my current system so that I don\u2019t just end up giving everything I watch a 9 or 10, unable to distinguish which shows were better.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are already familiar with my review scale, I\u2019m sorry for bringing this up again.\\n\\n\r\nNOW\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nThis show really became the dark horse of the Spring 2014 season. Much like my other favorite show of the season (Isshuukan Friends) I know I personally wasn\u2019t that hyped at all for this show. However after finishing the first season, I must say\u2026. This show is one hell of a good time.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8.0:\\n\r\nIf you have ever heard of Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? (The Problem Children are Coming From Another World Aren\u2019t They?) then the premise of this show will be very familiar. Undefeated NEET Gamer Siblings Sora and Shiro arrive in a world where everything is decided by games. This is a premise almost identical to that of the earlier mentioned show, but done, in my opinion, much better. I have to admit that the score in this department lost some points for lack of originality, but the execution of No Game No Life does a great job none the less. Seeking domination of the new world, and the right to challenge the one true God \u201cTet\u201d, Shiro and Sora encounter a slew of crazy games. These games are without a doubt, what sets this show\u2019s story apart from the aforementioned show. The games are wildly varied, from word games, to chess, to video games, and NEVER are they boring. The way Sora and Shiro just completely outwit and out strategize their opponents is a true treat to watch. Even just the unusual approaches to the games that the writer takes are brilliant. As of now, the biggest negative of the story besides its unoriginality is the fact that we have yet to scratch the surface! As of now, many different species have yet to be revealed and we are nowhere near a conclusion to the show. If a second season comes however (which I\u2019m sure it will), then these will resolved. You may think that this 8 score is low, but just trust me, 8 is pretty damn high. In fact, only 6 shows I have seen have gotten the 9 or higher nod.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8.1:\\n\r\nThe art-style of No Game No Life is really unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen before. The colors are extremely bright and everything just feels like a fantasy setting. It really fits the show perfectly. The character designs have to be noted as well because the designs are not only good, but the sheer variety of characters due to the different species is extremely impressive. Same can be said about the different environments and overall aesthetic of the fantasy world they are in. Not only is the style top notch in this show, but the actual animation and technical side of the show is top notch as well. This can be most clearly seen during games, when things are more hectic. I wouldn\u2019t say that the art is on the level of ufotable or P.A. Works\u2019 more recent stuff, but it is damn impressive for sure. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.7:\\n\r\nThe fantastical world of No Game No Life needs a fantastical soundtrack and over the top voice acting\u2026 Check aaand check. The music in No Game No Life is extremely fitting to the show, although I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be downloading any of the tracks for casual listening. The OP and ED were very catchy however, and I already have both of these on my phone. Voice acting is really where this show elevates itself into the high 7 range. Sora has the perfect bombastic, eccentric voice, and Shiro has one of the best loli voices I\u2019ve heard in a while. Really if you want to see what I mean, just watch the scene in one of the early episodes where Sora and Shiro are separated for a solid 30 seconds and they flip out...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8.0:\\n\r\nOne of the biggest highlights of this show is the duo of Sora and Shiro. Anime has really missed the over the top, tactical genius character with traits similar to Lelouch and Light Yagami, but thanks to Sora, the wait is over. Sora isn\u2019t an antihero like the aforementioned characters, but when he destroys his opponents in an all out game of wits\u2026. the nostalgia creeps in and I remember the excitement I felt watching Lelouch and Light. Shiro is much more quiet and cute, but at the same time\u2026 she is just as cunning. Outside of games, the pair are absolutely hilarious. Between Sora\u2019s over the top pervertedness and Shiro\u2019s full support of it, there is never a dirty joke opportunity missed. The side characters are definitely entertaining as well, although they do lack a bit in uniqueness. The biggest downside to the character department is that there is almost no character development beyond characters going from \u201cI hate/don\u2019t believe in Immanity!\u201d to \u201cI love/believe in Immanity!\u201d However, the sheer awesomeness of the 2 main characters largely overcomes this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7.9:\\n\r\nThis is a show that really just embodies what anime is. The over the top characters, wild action, fanservice, and a fantasy setting. The cherry on top would be if it were set in high school! No Game No Life lacks an emotional punch, but it is 100% fun to watch. The character interactions are downright hilarious. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat. Last but not least the games that are played are just an absolute treat to watch. There aren\u2019t many shows that make me want to beg for a second season, but No Game No Life is one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.94:\\n\r\nNo Game No Life and Isshuukan Friends both flew under the radar for me this season in favor of other big names like Captain Earth, Mahouka, and Black Bullet. However, these two shows easily take the crown for my favorites of the season. They are both vastly different from each other, but both kept me coming back excited for more. No Game No Life is hilarious, intense, exciting, and just flat out fun. If you want an anime that will keep you entertained from episode one until the end, look no further.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nA classic example of why we love anime and an absolute joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Legendary MCs\\n\r\n+ Games are ridiculously entertaining and creative\\n\r\n+ Art style is vibrant and lively\\n\r\n+ Hilarious jokes\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Lacks an emotional punch\\n\r\n- Unoriginal concept\\n\r\n- NEEDS A SEASON 2!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked No Game No Life, watch:\\n\r\nMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\\n\r\nCode Geass\\n\\n\r\n7.94/10 - Great",

            "content": "No Game No Life has gained pretty high popularity in the anime community. It is a psychological thriller much like Death Note or Code Geass except with a much lighter tone to the whole experience. Readers may want to immediately stop reading after that sentence if they have indeed seen any of those shows. What I mean by this is that it is a psychological thriller in the same vein as those shows, in that the thrill comes from the anticipation of what the characters are planning. Not from special attacks or epic battles but from seeing how these geniuses at what they do, utterlydestroy anyone who stands in the way of their goals. But does this show deserve to be compared to such great shows in its genre? Or is it just a failure? Let's find out!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nPOSITIVES\\n\r\nThe way each situation is laid out and plays out gave me feelings similar to the ones i felt while watching Death Note. A show that is widely considered to be among the best. The different races also add to the show with some being better at certain things and having different abilities that affect they way some of the games are played.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nNEGATIVES\\n\r\nThe plot is quite un-inspired. The 2 main characters are dropped into a world where everything is determined by the outcome of games. While on the surface this may seem like a very original idea, it is very similar to a show about a certain \"King of Games\" you may have watched when you were younger. Also the driving force for the plot is not done very well in my opinion with no satisfying conclusion for the actual anime. (Although i bet there is one in the manga)\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nPOSITIVES\\n\r\nThe art is very unique! This anime has a color pallet which even extends to the outlines of the characters. Often being a dark purple instead of just solid black. There is also an excellent use of bloom which isn't present in many other animes.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nNEGATIVES\\n\r\nThis show resorts to loli fanservice in the first few seconds of the first episode. While usually the fanservice in this show isn't too intrusive and most of the time i didn't mind it, this just sets a bad tone as the first time you see Shiro, you see her panties first.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nPOSITIVES\\n\r\nIntense/Cheerful songs mixed with silence for more serious moments works well in this show as the tone of the whole show is rather upbeat. I also quite enjoyed the intro song.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nNEGATIVES\\n\r\nNothing Special.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nPOSITIVES\\n\r\nThe genius duo in this show are quite entertaining to watch. As the show repeatedly says, the duo are one person known as Blank. 2 halves of the same genius. They are so closely tied together in fact, that one cannot function without the other. I found this a very interesting character trait that i rather liked.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nNEGATIVES\\n\r\nAll characters besides Blank are rather bland. Once you get past their interesting appearance, there really isn't much that's memorable about any of them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nPOSITIVES\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the interesting games that were in the show along with how Blank went about winning each one of them. The shows appeal is not in whether or not Blank will win but HOW they will win and how their opponents will TRY to win.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nNEGATIVES\\n\r\nYou are taught very quickly that Blank is not going to lose. This takes away from the enjoyment a little bit. The show also doesn't make you feel very invested in the subplot involving the kingdom. You also don't get a satisfying conclusion to the MAIN plot.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nIf you are interested in a show about psychological warfare similar to Death Note and Code Geass without expecting an incredibly satisfying ending, this is for you. With the exception of the weak story and side characters, This show was a joy to watch!\\n\\n\r\nIf you like this review, check out some of my others! Tell me what you think! ^_^",

            "content": "SHORT REVIEW\r\nStory - 2 gamers are summoned in a world where it is their field of expertise, games. Everything is decided by games so it's only naturally they're boss. \r\nThere are 3 ways to watch this anime : \r\n'An anime where the main characters aren't pussy and actually own ' OR \r\n'A colorful anime with excessive fanservice' (although there isn't much ecchi compared to the modern ecchi anime'  OR \r\n'watch the here and now. See characters climb from the lowest to the top' \r\nThe art stands out so well it is crazy. The insane bright colors may put some people off but it reallygrows on you and it is beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nSound - The OST wasn't particularly perfect but it definitely fit the mood extremely well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - You have a big bro and his cute imouto. They make up 'blank' which is basically their gamer name. After they learn most of the world, it's decided they'd help their race climb to the top. As the story progresses they obtain strong allies and continue to rule.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Now this might be repetitive but there are many epic scenes back-upped with the great OST in which the main characters just dominate. \\n\\n\r\nThings which are bad : \\n\\n\r\nThe anime has not ended. If there was a 2nd season then this would be one of the best anime out there. (Unless it pulls of a Mondaiji-tachi and just stops)\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are also too powerful. It seems as if they never lose and as soon as you think someone has outsmarted them 'poof' nup they countered \\n\\n\r\nThere definitely are ecchi scenes and fan service. Although they don't smudge your face with oppai and panty shots, it can sometimes be a bit much. \\n\\n\r\nStory 7\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\r\nCharacter 8 \\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to watch this anime is just watch naturally and be entertained. \\n\r\nIf you absolutely hate strong main characters, ecchi and vibrant art then i don't recommend it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "No Game No Life (NGNL) is actually a highly intellectual anime at its heart, bringing with it a meaningful and mutlifaceted depiction of life as a conquest of oneself.\r\nThe central conflict concerning individual life and the struggle of civilisation is painted with the question of mankind's true value. Through the usage of 'games', there is created both a triviliaisation of danger and yet at the same time it reflects a cynical and machiavellian worldview of politics, economy, and government; of control, power, and dominance.\r\nIn the reversing and then re-reversing of mankind's supremacy in the animal kingdom we can see the author's potent examination of whatit means to truly be human. Via the precarious situation in which a pre-industrialisation mankind finds itself beset upon by overwhelming forces of strength, intellect, and supernatural, we can see the hypothetical: \"If one loses in physical capability and in raw mental capacity, then in what way can that weaker triumph?\" NGNL answers this pertinent thought with awesome ease.\\n\r\nIn the overlying theme of making the most of the tools at one's disposal, there is a hearty rebellion against the perception of stagnation, helplessness, and the fatalistic perception of the world. NGNL is a rallying cry for the belief in the individual and a reminder of the need to persevere against all odds - to climb ever higher on the way to a brighter future.\\n\r\nHere, is surely a message to take to heart.\\n\\n\r\nUtilising the time-long fantasy of 'another-world', NGNL takes that tradition of adventure and gives us also a pampering filled with emotion, drama, wondrous humour, and an exoticism that is both original, but also an amalgamation of all the 60-long years of anime tradition that has come before it. In that sense, NGNL is the ultimate adventure of easy-viewing and heart-pounding mindgames.\\n\\n\r\nMany will note that NGNL is a love-letter to the escapist, gamer, and manipulator. There is no method greater than the mind, and there is no better weapon than a knowledge of one's opponent and their plans. NGNL depicts the back-and-forth of intertwining stratagems, underhanded tactics, and the inscrutable blending of ceaseless mind (planning) and explosive body (action).\\n\\n\r\nTechnically, the storytelling by Madhouse and Kamiya Yuu is almost flawless. Combining a unique aesthetic centering around simple lines and a rainbow array of technicolour, we can see the optimistim and liveliness of the show bellied by the unrealism of the 'game'.\\n\r\nThrough fast cutting and deformed 'reaction' faces, the director keeps us on our feet while also seamlessly sprinkling perfect refreshments of light comedy.\\n\r\nThe soundwork too,  is perfect, featuring a star-studded cast of voice-actors and an exciting accompanying soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, NGNL is a refreshing, and orgasmic delight of colours, laughter, and heartpounding tension. Yet do not be fooled by the entrancing exterior, this is a series with so very much to say for those who listen carefully. With open eyes, we join our heroes in the conquest of a fantastic world, and yet it is we, the fantasist audience, who is conquered in the end.",

            "content": "No Game No Life is one of the latest in a long, long, looooong line of shows in which a conventional author-insert protagonist who's supposed to be representative of the target audience (even while he's being impossibly badass) is dragged into a fantastical scenario in which he forms a harem of attractive female stock types and spends 12-25 episodes acting like a total boss and getting fawned over by the aforementioned bevy of babes. Chances are, you've seen that before. Sword Art Online. Highschool DxD. Black Bullet. Date A Live. In the same way that Hollywood regularly puts out films designed to pander to theegos of insecure men paranoid that modern society is leaving them emasculated and who demand films that reassure them that, yes, men still rule (here's looking at you Taken), the anime industry's usual output are shows designed to pander to self-proclaimed `social underdogs` (who, industry executives presume either cynically or realistically, represent the bulk of anime viewers) who want to be told that they're still the most awesome people out there. No Game No Life is one of those.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, almost uniquely, it's one of the few series that manages to make that formula kinda enjoyable for audiences who were never really invested in the whole Male Power Fantasy tradition (at least while still managing to be totally unironic about the whole thing).\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, No Game No Life is undeniably really standard stuff, and in lesser hands that might have cost it dearly. In this case, it's actually worth shutting out the subtext because the finished product, issues of representation and originality aside, is still pretty entertaining. Why is that? 'Cos the focus rests very strongly on comedy and action without allowing the show's underlying thematic missteps to take over and demand that we take the whole affair seriously. That's it. It gets away with being dumb because it's also fun, which a depressing amount of shounen anime these days forget to be. Even while the characters adhere to fairly conventional archetypes, they still manage to be endearing and their interactions are incredibly entertaining. The female characters are very overtly moecchi stock, but they still manage to contribute to the narrative through their own actions rather than simply serving as Damsels in Distress, Sexy Lamps or whatever other gendered clich\u00e9s have permeated storytelling since God knows how long ago. The series takes cues from adventure stories that are more about being fun, action-packed romps rather than resonant thematic odysseys, and uses its 2-dimensional but fairly loveable characters to tell a simple and seriously enjoyable little tale.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy's great, but in retrospect what you're really going to remember here is the action, which ends up being what most of the show exists in service of. The far-fetched premise paired with some pretty impressive direction allows for action sequences creative and intense enough to stand at the peak of the anime subgenre. What stands out here is the fact that none of it's dumbed down. The strategies at play are incredibly complex, employing mind-bending misdirection, stunning twists, encyclopaedic knowledge and totally awesome visuals all while maintaining coherence. It's testament to how intelligent ideas can amount to little more than dumb fun, as well as proof that the writer genuinely cared about making the story thrilling as well as entertaining. The tension is undermined somewhat by the fact that the protagonists are gifted with a kind of Narrative Invincibility that stops them from making any mistakes that might prove irreversible. Fortunately, the intricacy and inventiveness of the action, as well as the seamless relationship between the action and the comedy, incites just enough awe that the lack of genuine suspense doesn't feel like an issue.\\n\\n\r\nAs well as the subtextual issues I outlined earlier, No Game No Life does have its problems. The act of reducing PTSD in the two lead characters to a recurring gag with no real emotional weight feels like it could be pushing the boundaries of political correctness a little further than they should really go, and scenes which take advantage that for comedic effect don't have the desired impact. A couple of the early Game scenes aren't particularly good, but that kinda comes down to their small scale and the lack of any real stakes. They serve their purposes as exposition, but manage little else.\\n\\n\r\nWhat ends up being both ones of the show's most striking features and one of its biggest sticking points is the aesthetic. The design elements on display are pretty creative and stunning to look at, character designs are better than average for this kind of thing and it all flows very well with fantastic movements and good editing. The issue rests in the fact that the use of colour can sometimes be a bit too much. That is, sometimes shots are so saturated by the hugely colourful palette and almost omnipresent lens flare that making out detailed movements and silhouettes becomes a chore. A shame, given that every other element of the production is absolutely awesome to behold.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, if you're the kind of guy or girl that genuinely engages with the messages of this variety of trashy shounen light-novel adaptation, give it a miss and go watch something with some actual thematic integrity. I worry that you might watch this and start to think that acting like Sora is genuinely cool. That said, if you are able to just shut off you brain for a bit and enjoy some fun, over-the-top action-comedy, then No Game No Life really does deserve your time. It remembers that this stuff is all about being entertaining and doesn't try to put up the usual fa\u00e7ade of grittiness or empty thematic pretence to disguise its adherence to generic formula and heavily-gendered narrative tradition. In fact, it embraces the silliness of its concept with open arms and manages to be one of the most fun shounen anime of the last few years. Check it out.",

            "content": "After I had seen Clannad, I had become a full on anime fan. I was watching anime after anime searching for one that could simply compare to Clannad. And that is what brought me to keep on watching animes as I had simply enjoyed them sooner or later. However, after a while I had hit a brick wall, everything I watched was simply boring and the only amusement I had gained from watching was to see what would happen next. I was in anime despair, and wished I had found something that had got me on the edge of my seat and aching for more,clicking to the next episode because I had honestly enjoyed it. This anime had fulfilled my every desires, wishes, and more. This anime has been the one that I have aching for every since I had met that plain never ending brick wall. This anime had honestly left me on the edge of my seat, for once i had not kept on clicking the next episode simply to finish the anime, but because I had enjoyed it so much I could not stop. Don't mistake though, there are plenty of good animes where AFTER I had finished it I had thoroughly enjoyed it. However no game no life had had me wanting more, it was simply so good that I could not stop. Every episode was enjoyable, and when I had finally finished it, I was so excited there was this feeling that had been left inside of me. There is simply no anime like it, it had left me not with an aching pain because it had finished with many unanswered questions, but because I had wanted more. I will start off by showing the downside to no game no life; none. However there are complaints about this one, \"flaw,\" so I will explain. There is simply one flaw that can be easily overlooked and that is that each rule is explained very quickly, however this is a very small flaw. For example, if you don't know what shiritori is, you can easily look it up, as what I had done. If you are still left confused you can easily go back and see what the rules are again. Now, to get onto the strong points of no game no life that had made this anime amazing and had me honestly aching for more when I had finished. Many key points to this anime had shown where other animes had lacked, for example, they had a perfect balance of comedy and seriousness. Much so that you can't help but just feel that this is a perfect combination. Mostly, the sound, the art, and even the speeches that are given by Sora are honestly brilliant. You feel the emotion and feeling that had gone through, you feel connected with this anime and the characters involved. I know that sounds rather corny but you will understand once you watch. I had not put 10s for all categories because I am simply being childish and I had just finished the anime (well, maybe a little ;)). But because this anime deserves every point that it has received, the story and how it all links together in the end is simply brilliant, the art is vivid and crisp and clear, you can't help but be attached to the characters and enjoy them like as if they are a part of you. The overall perfect timing of seriousness and comedic timing makes you enjoy it far beyond anything, it had made me laugh more so than anime I have ever seen. The music was vivid as well and clear and matched what was going on near perfectly, and with all that combined. That leaves you with an overall enjoyment of 10, especially if you're a gamer. If you don't watch this anime, gamer or not, then you are simply missing out and that is your loss. Everything was timed perfectly, from the seriousness, to the comedy, to the music. It was all pieced together perfectly that had made this anime honestly the best I have ever seen. Everything is also explained thoroughly to a point where you can understand it and there will be no plot holes or unanswered questions left inside you, but instead because you want more. It is also set clear they will always win, and the new question that is left in your mind is how, and it is not a deus ex machina batman situation that is simply left unexplained. It is reasonable, understandable, and most of all, leaves you extremely impressed. \\n\r\nP.S\\n\r\n(Guys, I have re-read my review and realized this is simply joy from having just finished it, aka childish XD. I have decided to change my ratings for the anime, however I will not change my review, as I am too lazy :P. However I will write some negative points down below now explaining my new reasoning as to why I had in fact decreased the ratings.)\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story, although having to be very interesting can in fact at times seem very, explain oriented. For example how they always explain how they had won can be kind of... too much at times however, still badass though :P\\n\r\nArt: The art had been very very vivid and colorful indeed, however it is to mention that it was very bright even leaving me to turn on the lights and back away. I in fact liked this but there were of course times where my eyes had hurt after a while. This can be a very decreasing factor to its rating as most people can at the least accept \"darker tones\" while others might be simply too bothered to handle it. However, again, I had still enjoyed it very much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Although I had thought the sound and music had gone very well and hit every point, I also had noticed that none of it was simply a masterpiece that I'd listen to again and again as an OST. Don't get me wrong though, I listen to the OP and ED almost everyday ;).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters had been very enjoyable and fun to me, not to mention beyond cute (come on shiro is like a younger mashiro, how do you not love that!? :P). However the characters at most times act really dramatic and over enthusiastic, as this can be entertaining I would enjoy some moments where the characters (such as jibril) would show a thoughtful side showing she has internal problems having to do with her past. This would add a better plot and story, better character development, and characters in general. Also, if there were conflicts within the group that might also add an interesting factor.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I always enjoy everything, its always a 10 out of 10 for me no matter what ;)",

            "content": "12 episodes of praising Instrumental Reason doesn\u2019t make for good fiction, but it makes it clear why the anime blew up so much. Popularity is never a result of quality, but of fitting in with the zeitgeist, the common biases and worldviews of an age. That\u2019s why Game of Thrones is so popular since it shows a masculinity that\u2019s dark, therefore intelligent instead of the happy-go-lucky nonsense of 80\u2019s action films. As for this anime, its popularity comes from how blatant it is in showing Instrumental Reason to be the supreme reason. Imagine those vegans or marijuana advocates who think that their pet issues wouldsolve all the world\u2019s problems.\\n\\n\r\nBefore we discuss why this anime is so bad, let\u2019s clarify what I mean by \u2018Instrumental Reason\u2019. I capitalize it because it\u2019s a useful term. To use Charles Taylor\u2019s definition, it is reason which is about efficiancy and problem-solving. It asks how fast we can solve a problem, what is the best way to solve a problem.\\n\\n\r\nTake the case of a busted wheel. When your wheel\u2019s gone bust, you don\u2019t ask what it means, what ramifications it will have on pop culture or on our perception of gender and reality. All that matters is that we change tires as quickly as possible, and that the tire will be good enough to last as long as possible. While there are theories dissecting the meaning behind games, when we play chess we don\u2019t think what the game means. Rather, we asks how we beat the game.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, there is what I\u2019d call \u2018reason of meaning\u2019. By that, you ask what is the nature of things. We don\u2019t just ask how to end racism and poverty, but what exactly is racism and poverty. We\u2019re interested in understanding these issues, defining them, understanding what is bad. Instrumental Reason leads to a lot of money for hi-tech buffons, but it cannot solve all problems since it doesn\u2019t tell you what the problem, or the meaning of things is.\\n\\n\r\nSora and Shiro are one pair whose world is in Instrumental Reason. While games have meaning, the meaning is related to the mere act of playing. We don\u2019t question whether or not we should win a game and what is the nature of winning chess \u2013 the rules decide that. The world of Disboard is a world where every problem isn\u2019t just solved by games, but by Instrumental Reason.\\n\\n\r\nThat means it\u2019s a world that doesn\u2019t have any meaning at all. The nature of any problem doesn\u2019t matter, since there will be an arbitrary equation that must solved. Once we solve this equation, the problem ends. The anime tells the story of a megalomaniacal brother-and-sister who beat people in games, gain power and minions and occasionally pay lip-service to morality.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if the series was an examination of such Instrumental Reason, it would\u2019ve been fine. If Instrumental Reason was merely a dominant storytelling tool, then it could still have a decent story. By that, I mean that the show works similar to Death Note and Code Geass. The story moves mainly by challenges facing the characters, and the characters need to solve them. The viewer gains pleasure from trying to solve the riddle along with the characters. However, the meaning of these challenges isn\u2019t important.\\n\\n\r\nInstrumental Reason is so dominant in this anime that these challenges don\u2019t even pretend to have meaning. Death Note may have been a series of riddles, but underneath it there was supposed to be a story about the morality of executing criminals. It failed because it didn\u2019t create situations where we examined the issue, but rather only asked \u2018who will win?\u2019. In similar fashion, the only question this anime asks is \u2018how will Sora and Shiro win?\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nAs a storytelling tool, it\u2019s incredibly boring. It\u2019s essentially watching a staged game. The whole thrill of watching sports is that you don\u2019t know who will win and nothing is decided until the last moment. Stories which use Instrumental Reason make you watch a man playing chess against himself, only with more narrative fluff and (in the case of anime) pretty visuals.\\n\\n\r\nSo as a story, this is a complete failure. Really, it\u2019s about nothing. Only near the end it says something about the nature of games, but the whole thing happens in an alternative reality. Once the characters are thrown into it, no mention of the real world. Without admitting there is a real world where not everything is a game, it cannot explore the nature of games. Many throw the word \u2018escapist\u2019 around and it\u2019s always debatable how escapist a show is, but can anyone debate this? The characters literally escape the real world so they could play forever.\\n\\n\r\nIf the story is an absolute failure, at least it could do well in other aspects. Sadly, it\u2019s all bad except for the art. The art is easily some of anime\u2019s best. It\u2019s such a shame that a highlight in anime art is glued to a horrible story. Look at those vibrant colors, how every scene doesn\u2019t have so much a depth of detail but a depth of color. It creates the feeling of a truly fantastical world. It applies to character design, too. While the series is shameless in fanservice, each character gets its unique touch, unique eye shapes and hairstyles. Shiro isn\u2019t the best design, but her design is a good case in point. Her hair isn\u2019t just long but has a distinct flow to it. Jibril is another excellent case. For a character who floats around half-naked, they sure thought about a lot of unique touches \u2013 the asymmetrical gloves, the gardient in the hair.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, this is where the positives end. Some of the characters are good, but they need a different setting and a different storytelling method. Stephanie Dola could\u2019ve been a light in the dark, a contrast to the world. Her emotional reaction actually could\u2019ve added some \u2018reason of meaning\u2019, show us a character who thinks about other things besides winning. Too bad her role is to be slapped around, sexually humiliated and generally used as a tool. If so far you were convinced my rantings about \u2018Instrumental Reason\u2019 was just cranking about, here\u2019s the final nail. The anime takes its one character who has a different view than constantly puts it down.\\n\\n\r\nSora is tied to this problem, and to the misogyny problem. He\u2019s a 20th century masculine stereotype. Writing about transformation of masculinity in fiction is incomplete without him. We see how once the manly hero packed guns, now he\u2019s shagging women and is being a conniving, selfish asshole. What defines Sora isn\u2019t heroism like those in the 80\u2019s movies, but his pure \u2018Instrumental Reason\u2019. All that matters to him is winning, all he can think about is winning.\\n\\n\r\nOccasionally he displays some moral code about being nice to those he lose. We never see the general ethics that guide him, though. Since he\u2019s comfortable using everyone as pieces, he\u2019s more like a Wolf of Wall Street, doing everything to win and using people as means to an end. It fits with the zeitgeist. Go to school, and they will teach you how the only important thing is making loads of money. Whatever technology you invent, whatever content you produce, it doesn\u2019t matter so long as you get money. No surprise our politicians are so corrupt.\\n\\n\r\nUsing people as means, besides pissing off Kant also gives the whole anime a strong misogynistic bent. You don\u2019t just see women in sexy situations, but often humiliating situations. Stephanie gets the most of it. An episode is dedicated to treating her like an animal only to teach her a lesson. He also takes pictures of her nude without consent and there\u2019s the whole \u2018laughing at flat women\u2019 thing. I don\u2019t see anything funny about humiliating a girl, taking nude pictures of her and generally framing her as inferior and dumb. Worst of all, we\u2019re meant to cheer for Sora and the characters eventually come to like him. I don\u2019t see how his rise to power demanded treating Dola so awfully.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to the creator\u2019s idea, I would rather have a beer with Stephanie Dola and not just because she\u2019s a woman. No Game No Life is pure escapist fantasy for the hi-tech age. In an age where we want to just solve problems instead of thinking about their nature, it\u2019s the ideal anime. I\u2019m reminded of a story where some government officials asked how to lower the amount of poor people. Onc offered to change the definition to the American definitions, and then there will be less poor people on the count. Notice how the numbers change but no one asks what exactly poverty is and what\u2019s the actual problem. It\u2019s a comfortable mindset, but we don\u2019t live in Disboard. Our world isn\u2019t clean and ordered where each problems have clear laws. In this world, you have to ask what is the problem, what it means and the whole shebang. Also, you can\u2019t go around treating women like Sora treats Stephanie. Somebody might come and get all 80\u2019s Action Movie on your ass.\\n\\n\r\n1.5 misogynists out of 5",

            "content": "No Game No Life is not your typical \"run of the mill' anime.  Not by any means.  Five years ago I may not even have been drawn to its plotline, but after powering through it in two long sittings, I can assuredly say I'm glad i watched it.  \r\nThe story of NGNL seems pretty straightforward.  Supergaming brother and sister, Sora and Shiro are tired with the world they live in, and as a result are mysteriously drawn into an alternate realm where one must play games to reign supreme.  And of course, they are challenged to a chess game againstthe God of the world to get there.  I've seen a common thread between modern day animes, constantly feeding into the 21st century \"gaming\" genre.  Oh well, at least NGNL put a unique spin on it.  Throughout the 12 episodes, the super competitive duo powers their way to the top of the \"Imanity\" race, in hopes to best the world's other 15 races in a gaming environment, including the God that brought them there.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 10 over-arcing rules that govern this world... and they really help Sora and Shiro throughout their journey.  With these rules, an ordinary person can challenge anyone, anytime to any game, with the highest stakes possible, including their own free will.  The part that rubs me the wrong way is that Sora and Shiro ALWAYS win... and they are so damn cocky about it.  Whether the game is pure chance or not, they always find a way to exactly predict the necessary conditions to win ... and win they do.  It kind of takes the suspense out of it when they're up against the ropes in a tight match of wits, and then you remember \"oh yeah, they don't lose ever\".  Call it opinionated, but even I like to see the good guy get knocked down a peg from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my biggest complaint of the entire series is the artstyle.  i mean, the character designs and environments are decent, but it seems like everything in the show has a pink hazy tint to it.  It becomes cumbersome to look at if you're watching on a television and trying to read subtitles at the same time.  I guess I can see what the artists where trying to go for, creating an alternate universe and all.. but it fill a little short in my opinion.  The music/sound is also a tad lackluster, and sometimes I didn't notice it at all.  However, I did quite enjoy the opening.\\n\\n\r\nWhere this show really shines is in the characters and the writing.  The relationship that Sora and Shiro have for another can seem a little bit strange at first, but as the series continues becomes more understandable.  The ability for them to feed off each other during games and their overall dependency on one another is key to the series, but can seem to cross the line for a normal brother/sister relationship.  Most of the other characters that the duo come across are female, and at times the interactions with them seem super \"fan service\"-y.  The other supporting girl characters (Steph, Jibril etc.) all have bouncing or cute figures, and a strange infatuation for Sora at times.  The oddity of S&S's relationship elaborates when Shiro becomes jealous of the other female's attraction.  It's kinda weird...\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will say about NGNL is that it is quick-witted and just plain smart.  It can be rare to find an anime where I actually have to rewind just to try and catch all the small details.  It was actually pretty cool, to see if I could figure out how S&S were going to win the current game before it was revealed.  I recommend fans of shows like Death Note and Psycho pass to watch NGNL... even though it seems silly and fan service-y on the surface.  \\n\\n\r\nIn summation, NGNL is not necessarily for everyone, but I urge you to take a chance on it.... even if you think it looks \"remotely\" intriguing.  I eagerly await the announcement of its continuation, as there are now a few light novels floating around out there.  Here's to hoping!",

            "content": "When I started watching No Game No Life, I didn't really know what to expect. I didn't ever plan to see it, hell, I didn't even know it existed and was airing (I'm still not used to keeping track of new animes coming out). Thankfully, though, my friends told me about it somewhere around episode 7 and after I got convinced and caught up with the episodes, I had the great pleasure of watching it as it was aired, getting sucked into the story, holding my breath and uttering screams of protest at the cliffhangers with the rest of the Internet community... and basically justhaving tons of fun watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI've been wanting to write a review of NGNL for quite some time now, but I decided that I'll only do so when it finishes. While I am very much part of the hype surrounding NGNL, I wanted to wait and see whether the writers manage to finish as well as they started and keep the anime entertaining and clever till the very end. I can with pleasure say that they indeed did a great job, and while it is definitely not free of faults, I have many good things to see about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nPardon for the incoming wall-of-text. But that's just how I roll.\\n\\n\r\nNote: I didn't read the light novel on which NGNL is based, so I'll just review this anime regardless of the LN.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/fanservice: 9\\n\\n\r\nNormally, this section would be the last in my review, as it should be, but in the case of NGNL, there is something that must be said at the very beginning: NGNL fanservice level is off the charts. Ecchi moments are plentiful, cute animal girls as well in the last few episodes, basically just a dream come true for Sora, the lead male character. However, what is extraordinary, is the way in which the writers make it work. I mean probably not everyone will agree, but for me, personally, fanservice usually serves little purpose, but in NGNL, it was always done in a clever way and it always felt like not one wink from the creators, but two: first one for \"Hey, here's something for ya\" and the second one for \"Yup, we damn well know this is blatant fanservice, but just watch us do it with style\". Especially in the glorious episode 6 you can see how they manage to justify so much with the plot.\\n\r\nAnd of course it's still fanservice, nothing more. But the creators never go too far, one of their favorite things to do is to tease the viewer with something that seems like the oh-so-cliche incest theme, only to turn it into a huge joke a few seconds later. Basically, the writers seem to be having as much fun as the viewer, both pleasing and teasing him. It definitely is one of the main things that makes this anime extremely enjoyable... and I'm seriously not talking about just the jiggly boobs, believe me, as a still single male I tend to stay away from echhi for sanity's sake, but it's just the way in which it's done. So even if ecchi is not your thing, give this anime a chance. If anything, it's just a perfect humorous addition to an anime that is... perhaps surprisingly, so much more.\\n\r\nOf course, since I started with enjoyment, I need to highlight the most prominent aspect of the anime: games. In an anime where everything is about games, the whole idea could've just collapsed if the games were just your run-off-the-mill games, but thankfully the games the main characters' find themselves playing are always original and unique takes on well-known games and are plenty of fun to watch. Especially when the genius-gamer mode gets switched on.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, I haven't seen enough animes to be one to talk about originality and interesting concepts. I'm pretty sure games and gamers are quite a popular motive in the anime/manga industry. Regardless of that, however, I think the story of No Game No Life has a fantastic concept - I mean two siblings who are absolute masters of games but hate real life getting transported by a childlike god of games into a fantastic world where literally everything is a game? How could a perfect setting like that go wrong?\\n\r\nWell naturally, it could have. Quite easily, as many great ideas can get wasted. But thankfully the writers made sure to keep up with the pace they set themselves and not only did they make sure to keep the story interesting until the very end with various twists and turns, they also managed to entertain me heartily with unique games the characters played - and the usually mind-blowing strategies that came with them. I have to admit that the ending of this season was not as spectacular as I had hoped, but it wasn't bad either and it did directly suggest a season 2 coming, so I'm not going to go complaining about it.\\n\r\nOne issue I had with the story is that sometimes the train of thought of Sora or Shiro got hard to follow and I needed to rewatch some moments to fully grasp what's going on in their heads. Also, the further the anime progressed, the more far-fetched the main characters' genius mind abilities became and even for a completely unbelievable setting like this they were a bit TOO unbelievable. But those were rather minor faults.\\n\r\nSome might complain that the pacing was uneven - there is some truth in that. The fast-paced episodes, which were usually about the main pair playing a grand game against an opponent were usually intertwined with slower episodes which set the stage. But personally, while it was noticeable, I don't necessarily think it was a bad thing, especially since the slower episodes gave us interesting backstories, progressed the characters' relations and, like I just mentioned, set the stage for the action-packed games.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nI gotta admit, when I first saw NGNL, I really didn't like the rather clashing color palette used to depict the fantasy game world. It seemed too sweet yet at the same time too aggressive for the eye. But maybe it was just because I simply wasn't used to colors as bold as these in animes (that's saying something, isn't it?) and it was a bit of a shock, because with time not only did I get used to it, I started to grow very fond of it since it proved to be a huge asset of making the game world seem like, well, a game. Also, it went with a quite unique style (I especially enjoyed the different shapes of eye irises according to race) which made all the intense moments even more intense... and the cute things even cuter. So in the end, while it slightly scared me at first, the art became one of my favorite aspects of this anime in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was good. On one hand, I can't remember any memorable themes from this anime, but on the other hand that's not necessarily the point of OSTs. Because what the soundtrack should do (and it did in this anime) is just play in the background, helping build up the atmosphere, quicken up the pace in moments full of action and setting up the right mood when things got serious for a moment. \\n\r\nThe opening was quite decent, but personally I preferws the ending. The ending was quite different from the rest of the anime, I'd even risk saying it was quite touching, but still both the OP and ED fit the anime very well in my opinion.\\n\r\nThe voice acting, while not something absolutely mind-blowing, was also good. I think the voices fit the characters very well and were pleasing to the ear, so the VA will surely not get in the way of you enjoying the anime\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nAs in most animes with 12-13 episodes, there is relatively little time for building relations and character development and such is the case here. We don't see much (if any) character development or relation progressing, but then I wouldn't say it's really something that's missing in this anime. The characters are an entertaining bunch, they interact with each other well, giving us both hilarious and touching moments, keeping the story involving. The supporting characters, while not extremely complex or original, are still given some interesting backstories and traits that make them important parts of the story.\\n\r\nHowever, it's the main protagonist duo that really got me really attached to this anime. While, as I mentioned before, the creators tend to joke around and tease the viewer by adding some brother-sister lovin' jokes here and there, in reality Sora's and Shiro's relationship actually strikes me as very deep and even moving. They are literally everything to each other. They spent their entire childhood together, hiding themselves from society and becoming the legendary unbeatable \"Blank\" gaming team together and it is quite often emphasized how important they are to each other. Not only in comedy, but also in some touching moments. Especially one episode (about which I can't say much for the sake of not spoiling it to anyone) explored their attachment to one another and for me it was one of the best, if not the best, episodes of the anime. Especially since it was paired with a mind blowing solution to a game, naturally.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up, NGNL is quite an unique anime. It has a great setting and an interesting plot, it brings plenty of enjoyment with it's games and hilarious fanservice. It has it's faults as far as the story is concerned and I guess quite a few people will find the cliches and fanservice tiring, but I personally enjoyed it immensely. While I don't think it's current standing on MAL's top anime list is really deserved (but isn't that always the case when hype is up), I definitely think it's something every anime fan should at least check out. And if you don't like it, at least check out episode 6 because that truly is something.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I highly recommend it. Just don't watch it with friends unfamiliar with anime nearby, or if they peek at your screen at the wrong moment you'll have a hard time explaining how this anime is, after all, not about boobs and that it is just \"part of the game they're playing\" ;P\\n\\n\r\nCheers!",

            "content": "No Game No Life is an anime of our age. It has solid animation quality, catchy opening song, and escapism-flavored generic story and characters. Anime has to succeed at least one of four main departments to get viewers' attention: characters, story, animation and escapist fantasies. The last one is the cheapest trick in the book. Therefore the market is inundated with isekai genre, where characters are thrown into a fantasy world to realize their daydreams. \r\nNo Game No Life succeeds in animation and escapism. Additionally, the staggering amount of fan service, references to other successful anime, and overused jokes try to make up for thelack of a good plot. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: they can belong to any other mediocre anime\\n\r\nThe two super smart main characters can defeat everyone with their intelligence. This is probably the most universal escapist daydream. Their super brain power reveals itself in games. Other characters are there to get impressed by our heroes or defeated by them. They are usually girls, and they have over-sexualized bodies or cat ears, or both. What they lack in character depth is compensated by fan service. Nevertheless, the anime fails to conceal the lack of any meaningful character development.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: let me sing you the song of my daydreams\\n\r\nNo Game adds intelligent shut-ins to a completely new world but fails to develop any kind of interesting plot. The idea of traveling to an alternative universe is not new, but not bad either. The problem lies in execution. No Game is about being smart and defeating everyone. It is being awesome for the sake of awesomeness. The viewer is intended to get impressed and identify with our heroes. Their overpowered brains can overcome any obstacle, which means that there is no serious conflict in the story. From the very beginning you know that the main characters have indestructible plot armor.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: take this eye candy and stop asking for good characters and story\\n\r\nI have nothing but praise for the animation and sound. It succeeds at creating its own atmosphere. Music is also good and catchy. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: escapism and fantasies can save the anime industry\\n\r\nNo Game No Life is a great success story of an average anime. Although it uses pretty cheap tricks, it can grab the attention of many anime fans.\\n",

            "content": "2014's best show comes to an exciting climax, not only leaving the viewer breathless, but in deep anticipation for a season two! No Game, No Life is not only great, but a perfect illustration of how each genre of anime it represents should be done. \r\nGenericness is something that has plagued anime in recent years. Those shows that attempt something outside of the generic are the ones that become notable, but those that try to walk along the thin line of being generic, while trying to bring something new usually fall. No Game, No Life is one of those rare few shows that takes everythingthat should be generic - like fanservice, being trapped in a video game, and character archetypes - and completely succeeds in being original and downright awesome!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\\n\r\nBrother and sister, Sora and Shiro, are two brilliant minds obsessed with gaming who are transported to an alternate reality where the entire world revolves around games. Disputes are solved by games, whether it be something like poker, chess, or something more. So now you might be saying, \"That sounds weird and stupid.\" Where No Game, No LIfe succeeds is that it takes its basic foundations and creates something exciting and brilliant out of simplicity. A simple chess game becomes a true battle between armies, putting Wizard's Chess in Harry Potter to utter shame! When this show began airing, people immediately started comparing it to Sword Art Online. However, this isn't fair to the show. They may have the same basic foundation: Gaming, but the similarities end there. In fact, I might even compare this show to Death Note. Now, before you hop on the hate-train, let me explain myself. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is all about the games. Not only that, but the tactics and solutions behind each game. Each game feels like an intense brain game, where you are attempting to work out a way to win. The game concludes with Sora and Shiro explaining exactly how they worked out how the game worked. Example: A game of rock-paper-scissors becomes not about random chance, but instead about getting inside the head of the opponent, working out how they will think, and reacting accordingly. So, when I say I compare this show to Death Note, that is what I mean. No, the tone and everything are completely different. This is a light-hearted, adventure-comedy, where the stakes may be high, but there is never any darkness or overbearing feeling of imminent death. Instead, No Game, No Life is like Death Note because it is all about reading the thoughts of your opponents, working out how the game works at its center, and outsmarting the opponent through sheer brilliance. The way I have to explain this is difficult, because I'm trying to carefully dance around spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying, this show is beautiful. It doesn't do anything special with direction and cinematography like something SHAFT (Monogatari Series, Madoka Magica, Ef: A Tale of Memories) would put out, but it makes full use of its video game-esque backdrop to stay vibrant and beautiful. And that's what this show is: Beautiful. Any object with color seems to have an aura of bright color around it, so everything in the show looks like that thumbnail: Bright, cheerful, beautiful, and colorful. Everything has great detail, animation is smooth, and effects are used with brilliance to fully immerse the viewer in its vibrant, exciting world. \\n\\n\r\nEcchi Corner: Well, it seems like this is a good place to put my review of the ecchi content in this show. My verdict: It's much more like fanservice than ecchi. Seeing that R+ rating made me a little hesitant. I didn't want another Nisemonogatari to happen: A great show, but way too much focus on ecchiness. And that's what that show, Nisemonogatari, became. All the episodes were centered around ecchi situations, which seriously dulled the great story and direction. Not so with No Game, No Life. Pretty much every single episode does have some fanservice, whether it be a brief pantsu shot or sudden oppai, but, though it may be a lot in some episodes (especially when Sora wishes everyone's clothes to disappear), but it rarely feels like the show becomes about fanservice. It's kinda like, \"Here's your dosage of fanservice for the episode, we'll play around with it for awhile, but now we need to let that take a backseat and focus on the story.\" In this way, those who enjoy ecchi/fanservice will be thoroughly pleased with the content of this show, but those who despise fanservice won't be bother too much by it, beyond being slightly annoyed briefly, but quickly looking past it. For me personally, I prefer to keep my shows separate. If I want fanservice, I'll enjoy watching a Haganai or something, but when I want something else, I don't want fanservice popping into the show randomly. This show did well to balance it out, so I never felt annoyed by the ecchi, and, in fact, didn't mind it at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to say here. The soundtrack is good in the moment, but not really memorable or something you will actively listen to outside the show. It's good for what it needs to do, but not much else. \\n\\n\r\nNow that I've said everything I can about the OST (There wasn't much to say), I'll talk about the opening and ending for the show. The opening, OP, is considerably entertaining, and is actually pretty good, but nothing super amazing. It's exactly what you've come to expect from a modern anime opening. But, I never once wanted to skip it. The song that plays is a good song, no doubt about it, but nothing groundbreaking. It was simply a good song that I'll probably look up and listen to, but that won't be remembered in any Top Openings list. What I'm trying to say, is it ain't no Cowboy Bebop, Elfen Lied, or Attack on Titan opening. As for the ending, ED, it's actually really good. Again, nothing groundbreaking, but still rather special. It uses watercolor-esque pictures to frame a dramatic backstory look on Sora and Shiro as children, all set to a beautifully dramatic, melodic song. It isn't mindblowing, but it still manages to capture my attention every time I see it.\\n\\n\r\nPlease note here that my mentioning of voice acting shall be written under their respective person in the next section.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\n\"What!? You gave the characters an 8!? How dare you!\" Before you pick up your torches and pitchforks, allow me to explain. 1. By MyAnimeList standards, an 8 counts as Very Good, and 2. I really enjoyed the characters, but there was nothing I hadn't really seen before. Good characters who either play at their stereotype hilariously, bring something new to the stereotype, or transcend it altogether. Let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nSora: The main character along with his sister, is just, plain awesome. His brilliance cannot be overstated. He is clever and cunning, and let's everyone know it. He combines the brains of L from Death Note with the dramatic flair and awesomeness of Lelouch from Code Geass. He also takes time out of his screen-time to make hilarious quips and jokes. He's so brilliant, he will never make a mistake and he knows it. He also has a strong affinity to, well, let's just say he has ecchi-tendencies and kawaiiness. At one point he commands someone to dress in a kawaii dog outfit for a day. At another point, he fawns over a catgirl. As of season one, he may not be the deepest character, but he sure is one heck of a cool one. His voice actor does a good job of acting with smug seriousness when he needs to and with hilarity when Sora falls victim to moe.\\n\\n\r\nShiro: The other half of this dynamic duo, Shiro is even smarter than Sora. An eleven year old genius who oftentimes saves Sora or, most commonly, works together with Sora as one to defeat an opponent. She's more quiet and cool-headed, and doesn't show much of her personality. She's a fun character to watch, but arguably a bit generic. She does a good job at playing with her genericness, though, oftentimes tricking the audience into thinking she will do one thing based off of her character type, but then doing something different and brilliant instead. Her voice actress does a great job becoming the character she's supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nStephanie: Yes, her character is stereotypical, but she does a great job at simply playing at that stereotype. Knowing exactly what type of character she will be from the beginning allows the audience to immediately accept the humor in the situations surrounding her. And that's what she is: The comic-relief. Well, actually, every character in this show does a good job at being funny at one point or another, but Steph is generally the funniest of all. Most of the humor revolving around her mostly has to do with fanservice and/or light ecchi, but she keeps it hilarious, even if its a bit predictable. Yes, she is that slightly baka character who can't seem to do anything right, but she's just the character she needs to be. Her voice actress does an exceptional job capturing her character and keeping all the moments with her in it funny.\\n\\n\r\nJibril: She shows up later in the show just when it felt like another character was needed. She, again, is nothing you haven't seen many times before, but she keeps the show interesting, adds another layer to the already impressive character list, and even has some hilarious moments of her own. Her voice actress is also good, bringing the character to life.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they generally act like they are going to be generic, but then break out of that and create something interesting. They can generally all be funny, but know when to perfectly act for how the situation calls for. In review, the characters are all interesting and fun, but they are rarely anything absolutely exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nThis show is, if nothing else, super entertaining. It might not be that deep, inspiring, thought-provoking, or emotional, but it is exceptionally enjoyable to watch and oftentimes edge-of-your-seat exciting. I can't think of a single moment in this show that I was bored in. Even if a moment would have normally been dull, this show does a great job of keeping the animation interesting or having something else going on to keep everything moving forward without becoming stale. That's another thing the show succeeds at. It does one thing, and then moves on to something else, so that it never once becomes stale. One game is finished? Alright, we'll begin setting the stage for the next game. As for the games themselves, they are the most entertaining of all. Every single one of them is exciting and fun to not only watch, but try to figure out a way to win. Each game is like a separate awesome experience, and each one just gets better and better. This show is light-hearted and viscerally exciting, making it an absolute joy to watch. Oh, before I forget, there are a ton of video game references scattered throughout. I stood up and cheered at the incredible Phoenix Wright reference. Be on the look out for over 9000 anime and video game references, ranging from Hyouka to Persona to Skyrim! Can I find a negative somewhere? Yes: It's far too short! Twelve episodes is far too short! By the time everything gets started and starts mounting in awesomeness, it's all over. Based on its popularity, it is bound to get a sequel, but, gaah, I just can't wait! The creators of this show are going to have a hard time topping an already amazing first season!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\n\"What!? You say all these amazing things about the show and then only give it a 9?\" As far as ratings go, I rarely give above a 9. [NOTE: The rest of this paragraph is an explanation on how my ratings work. If you don't care about other shows I've given 9s to justify my rating and so on, skip to the next paragraph] A 9 is an exceptional anime that I will not only rewatch at some point, but will definitely recommend to others. A 9 is an incredible show that will be remembered as being awesome! For something to get a 10 from me, it needs to do something absolutely unbelievable, such as CLANNAD or FMA. Just to give you a little perspective, exceptional shows like Code Geass, Darker than Black, Fate/Zero, Toradora, Trigun, and Gurren Lagann were all given 9s by me. I have given 9.5 to shows like Madoka Magica, Cowboy Bebop, and AnoHana. This is just to give you a little perspective on how I rate things.\\n\\n\r\nNo Game, No Life is an unexpectedly exceptional show that has a simple premise that it builds greatly off of, vibrant animation, great sound, and really good characters who, though they may be rather generic, are really fun and interesting to watch. The show is light-hearted as to be an absolute joy to watch and a surplus of exciting moments and surprises!\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+ Constant edge-of-your-seat excitement\\n\r\n+ Perfect vibrant art that adds to the light-hearted tone of the show\\n\r\n+ A great balance between the story and the fanservice\\n\r\n+ Hilarious moments\\n\r\n+ Funny, entertaining characters\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n- The characters may occasionally come across as generic\\n\r\n- It's just too dang short!\\n\\n\r\nAuthor's Note: Feel free to tell me what you liked and didn't like in this review, and I'll try to adapt my future reviews accordingly. This is my first review to publish on MyAnimeList, but I plan to write more soon. Also feel free to send me a friend request if you want!\\n\\n\r\n*Transmission End*",

            "content": "I initially dropped this halfway, but decided to give it another chance since I wanted to discover what made this series so popular, turns out the rest didn\u2019t really improve and while this show has some qualities, the negative aspects really stand out too much for me to make it enjoyable. \r\nStory: I\u2019m not an expert when it comes to the RPG genre, but even though the games are interesting and the moves rather easy to understand everything else just seems like a waste of time. The plot looked very promising at first, the ten pledges and the idea of using games to decide thingswere rather interesting. This, however, was quickly ruined by the amount of fanservice scenes and the failed attemps at being funny.. Although tension is built at times, the filler episodes are extremely boring, and paintful to watch since the character barely have any development. The gaming aspect might be interesting at times, but is kinda ruined by the poorly designed characters and fanservice. Betting everything they got might add tension to the games, but makes the outcome too obvious. The main thing that ruins the plot is the episodes between the important games. Because the characters are little more than clich\u00e9s, these episodes are long and boring, and the humour, which mainly consists of characters overacting, becomes repetitive, predicable and rather annoying. Some important information is being inserted during these episodes, but every time it basically goes like \u2018you will never defeat [nation] because \u2026\u2019 in which Sora and Shiro would reply \u2018blank never loses\u2019, and end with Stephanie panicking. Sora and Shiro\u2019s past was clich\u00e9, and not detailed enough to be able to make the viewers empathize with them. Not only that, but Shiro\u2019s overly moe voice ruins the dramatic effect . \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are little more than stereotypes, the type of characters you see 37632 times, just with different names and designs. While considering the setting it\u2019s logic that the protagonists are overpowered, they turn out to be rather uninteresting since they hardly face any struggles or character development. Sora\u2019s hikkikomori issue is only joked about, and not really addressed until the end of the show. Since he was a hikkikomori before, you\u2019d expect him to have difficulty interacting with others and probably some self esteem issues. But no, his social skills just come out of nowhere, even though he probably hasn\u2019t spoken to anyone other than Shiro for a long time. Another aspect that has always bothered me is how his perversity is regarded as joke rather than a serious issue, especially considering the fact that he even lusts after really young characters even though he\u2019s 18. More to that, the only opposition to his perversity was Stephanie whining, which was ineffective of course. Shiro is the just the typical kuudere character, the only significant personal issues she seems to have faces was during the match with Kurami and after being separated from Shiro, which was expected and barely changed her character. Furthermore, they seem to win while barely trying, they rarely ever struggle, and don\u2019t do their duty as rules or Imanity. Every one of their quotes can be pretty much reduced to \u2018we will never lose\u2019 \u2018checkmate\u2019, or something perverted. The worst is Stephanie Dola; despite always tagging along the main characters, she\u2019s mainly here for the fanservice. She\u2019s unintelligent compared to Sora and Shiro, and can only complain her horrible treatment, which makes her extremely annoying. By saying only some cheesy lines, they manage to have her under their feet.  Often she will just state obvious things, basically everything about her is just a waste of screentime. Although they try to add some character depth with her issue with her grandpa, it just seems really clich\u00e9. If they removed that character, almost nothing would be changed. \\n\\n\r\nSound: While the soundtracks and seiyus\u2019 voices were fitting, nothing really stood out. The voices are very cute, but get annoying after a while since the same tones are overused and even dramatic scenes sound like a joke with the overly cute voices. I guess they spent too much of their budget on the art to make better soundtracks. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Probably the greatest thing about this show. The art is very detailed and colourful, and the backgrounds are very well drawn. However, the characters look like typical moe characters, which is a waste since their outfits are really interesting.  Furthermore, I\u2019m really turned off by the fanservice, I understand that it\u2019s supposed to appeal the male viewers, but the fact that it even sexualizes children is disgusting, and just makes this show seem like little more than bait for old perverts. \\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, so don't expect anything mind-blowing from it. \r\n Story:\r\n 7/10\r\n No Game No Life has an interesting premise. In the first episode, our main characters, Sora and his little sister Shiro, are transported to a world where everything is decided by games (the world itself basically a huge video game, with different races and locations). Yes, it's nothing /too/ ground-breaking (the keyword here is SAO) but it's intriguing nonetheless, and certainly had me interested within the first few episodes. However, I do feel that one of the weaker points of the story is that it could have had alot more development. A lot of episodes are injected with scenes entirely dedicated to fanservice, even up to the very last episode, and I feel that a lot of potential was lost where they could have used that time to, say, add in another game (most of which were captivating to watch) or had more stuff actually... happen. The fanservicy element is also why I found the final (big) battle to be slightly anti-climatic. Then again, I'm not the target audience for this kind of  fanservice (hetero female), so maybe I should just go rewatch Free! or something. Pacing was fine, and not an issue for this anime - the ending also seemed to hope for a second season, so we may hear something on that soon.\\n\\n\r\n Art:\\n\r\n 10/10\\n\r\n I loved the art for this series. It was unique (or at least, in a style I haven't come across before), the colours were vibrant and felt very fantastical - just like a video game. Character design was also a strong point of this anime, I felt, with the god of the game world standing out here - his design was perfect for a character who loved playing around, yet the viewer is still left slightly suspicious of, which creates a great contrast between his design and his personality. The colours of this series were pleasing to the eye, and I enjoyed watching the series a lot partly because of the art.\\n\\n\r\n Sound:\\n\r\n 7/10\\n\r\n Pretty good. I do like the opening theme, though it's not outstanding - I would listen to it now and again if I remembered, but it's not something I'd ever really put on repeat. The ending theme was pleasant too, but quite forgettable. Overall, about a day after finishing the anime, I can't remember any of the OST, except for one particular track I quite liked. The music was decent in general, though not spectacular. Character voices were good and fit them well. I particularly liked Sora's voice as one that stood out (talking sub here, haven't seen the dub, nor am I sure one yet exists, though I find it pretty likely this series will get licensed at some point if it hasn't already).\\n\\n\r\n Character:\\n\r\n 3/10\\n\r\n Probably one of the series' greatest flaws is its characters. None of the characters really get any great amount of development at all. Our main duo have about a two minute flashback or so of the time they first met, but barely anything else. Their personalities are based on gimmicks ( highly intelligent NEETs with a brother-sister relationship) and don't really have any dept to them at all. I would say some of the side characters (Stephanie and Zell for example) get better development than the main pair, yet even they aren't fleshed out that much. The show was only 12 episodes, but I have seen 12 episode anime do character development a lot better than this show. Again, the issue of fanservice versus using episode time for something that enhances the story springs to mind.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment:\\n\r\n 7/10\\n\r\n No Game No Life is fun to watch. It's not one of those anime where I've thought to myself in every episode: \"has it been twenty minutes yet?\". The games, though I feel there could have been more of them, or at least more of the interesting ones, were enjoyable to watch, and although Sora and Shiro's plans were always clever, and it was fun to see how they'd face the problem in front of them, they'd never work in real life. But who cares? Anime doesn't have to make sense. Just the fact that they'd never work makes it that more entertaining. \\n\\n\r\n Summary:\\n\r\n Overall score: 7/10\\n\r\n If this anime hadn't had similar \"this was my plan all along\" tricks to Code Geass, which I absolutely love in an anime, I probably would have given it a lower score than 7. But I really enjoy this kind of thing, and it really does leave a viewer wanting more. If it had used its time more wisely and really taken an effort to flesh out its characters or add a bit more in to the plot (story-plot, not the other kind), I felt like this could have netted a 10/10 from me. As it is, whilst a very enjoyable anime, I feel like there was a lot of missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential, which was really a shame.",

Although occasionally some details from the story are out of touch from LN, they do not break away from the story. \r\n-Sound\r\nDescend to the level of sound reduction effects enough to really giving you feelings at the moment. \r\n-Character\r\nThe characters are all very nicely created. The first story takes youunder the influence instantly. You wonder, now how things come out of this you will constantly waiting for it and eventually at the end through which really is very clever of the plans you see. After applying the fact that you will be jealous and will say yourself \"so what I'd do the exact same thing as they do!\" Need to congratulate the authors on this subject. \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\nIn general, if you look to the end promises you an enjoyable minutes until the end.

            "content": "Just your average-everyday anime-viewer here, with another review!\r\n\"Rule no. 10; Let's all have fun and play together!\"\r\n- The Tenth Pledge\r\nWhen I first ran into this anime and read through the synopsis of the plot, I thought I hit yet another generic plot of which more and more mainstream anime such as SAO or Log Horizon. I had never been so wrong before in my life. This 12-long episode show (with fingers crossing for a sequel) brings forth maybe not the most original plot in anime so far, but a pretty original TWIST to the plot itself.\r\nBefore reading on, this review is spoiler-free, so don't worryshould you want to watch this show after reading the review. I take it that you've read the synopsis yourself and maybe even watched the show. This review also comes with a TL;DR section, right at the bottom before the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story: 9/10\\n\r\nAlready in the first episode and things get really exciting, really fast. And take my word for it, they go fast, but slow and simple enough for us viewers to understand our greeted protagonists before moving along with the main plot. Getting literally thrown into another world maybe after ten minutes into the first episode, and everything you need to know about the world is masterfully explained with the ten pledges that govern and rule the world of Disboard. After the 10,000 meter freefall and every game onwards is a wonderful tale of its own, easy to watch, difficult to master. How they portray and making the games interesting with ever so slightly seen twist and turns to the rules is interesting in its own right. Heck, they even made a game of paper-rock-scissor look interesting as fuck. As we progress further and further into the story, you'll start to curve your view on the games itself in relation to our heroes [BLANK]. This happens subconsciously, with your view changing from IF they will win to HOW they will win. At that point, the lines between interesting and fun not only are edge to edge between each other, they overlap. At the end though, the every piece of the puzzle is shown to us in its own might and all you've seen so far connects masterfully with each other, everything from the games being played to the characters to the pledges themselves. And yeah, the plot-pace is point-perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 10/10\\n\r\nThis seems to be quite a controversial topic when discussing the art of NGNL with people on MAL. Some love it, some hate it. Personally, I think it fits perfectly with the story and the anime itself wouldn't be so good if it wasn't for the almost over-saturated colours and odd mixture of color-palets. This is a testamente to the ever so lasting legacy of which this anime hold near and dear to my heart. The art itself has a great focus on making the anime look like a game and may even be percieved as one, yet it is not. I like how the anime makes itself stand out of the crowd and that's always good (I think...). To go into details about the art itself, the portrayal of each and every character are unique and easy to look at, easier to remember. No character gets mixed up with another, and that's always a relief. The background is beautiful and adds a silver lining to the show but the best part is the games. This is where the art truly shines and it shines bright as hell. The effects and impact of each game are epic not only looking at, but also understanding them as well. All games are rememberable, mostly due to how well they were executed and shown to us. The only downside I had was the more ecchi parts of the show, which personally for me, didn't bother me at all the first run I had with this series. For some, they might dislike it, but not for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: 10/10\\n\r\nI'll start of like they do in anime, with the OP first. NGNL has only one OP, but a rememberable and quite the epic one. Played by Konomi Suzuki, \"This Game\" really leaves a mark in your memory as it was not only upbeat and thrilling, it also brought conventional music-playing to a whole new level. As the animation of the intro play along with the song beautifully, the OP is just a great bonus and another reason for watching the next episode, or even off the screen. The background music is game-themed, meaning little-to-none music played with regular instruments. Again, here, NGNL emphasize the significance of games in the show. If you're a gamer, you can distinguish the music being played depending on what kind of situation is going on the screen. Maybe it's something more faster in pace due to the conclusion of a game, or another tone for a twist that may turn the tide in that very same game. Again, it feels like I'm repeating myself, NGNL could not have gotten so far as a well-beloved show if it wasn't for the unique music as well, along with the great and fairly unique animation. I can't really find anything wrong here. I just loved it!\\n\\n\r\nThe Character(s): 9/10\\n\r\nNo two characters are alike, not even Sora and Shiro. Sure, they may be gaming-prodiges but they are two sides of a coin to each other. And that's what makes these two very interesting. With both of the characters being on each side of the same coin, named [BLANK], they help each other with their own strengths and intelligence in the game. They falter behind, however, outside the game. New elements are shown to us about [BLANK] as the series progress and that's always something fun and interesting to see, knowing that they aren't gods even with their master-minds and great sense for gaming. The flaws is what makes them human, and it is there where the character development is at its strongest between them. Their bond is what makes them great in the game, and their flaws is what makes this series great as well. The other characters in the show has their role to fill and the fill it perfectly. All rememberable and distinguishable from each other, the roles that they all play are significant and play their part in the overall story. For a twelve-episode long series, they managed to cram in a perfect number of side-characters. They don't, however, have an emotional character-development like Sora & Shiro has, but a character-development in their skills instead. But they do have a really heavy episode which focuses on the characters parse and explores their motives extremely well, leaving one of the side-characters especially understood by us viewers. This is interesting, since some may like it, and some don't. You can guess which I stand for.\\n\\n\r\nMy Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nSeeing how they beat a certain game always left me for more, almost to the point of skipping the episodes in-between to just see the games themselves. But, I quickly realized that the games would be half as good if it wasn't for the episodes in-between. There was this hype that needed to be calmed down and I easily watched the entire series through one night (which wasn't very long) and craved for more when I ended the twelveth episode (those who've seen it understand why). This series has not only given me a great time but also given me a new perspective on how games should be viewed, their significance in my daily life and everybody else's.\\n\\n\r\nHow it was Overall: 9.6/10\\n\r\nThis anime is loved by many and many more to come. They have really brought out a new standard when it comes to how games should be percieved as and even stand out within the anime community, for reasons other than infamous ones such as overly sexualized or controversial. I have no doubts that when (not if, hopefully) season two comes out, NGNL will not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n+ Original twist to the story\\n\r\n+ Plot-pace is perfect\\n\r\n+ Plotpoints connect and makes sense\\n\r\n+ New, refreshing and exciting games comes along for us to view\\n\r\n+/- The ending. Most of you know what I mean about here\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n+ Very unique colours used\\n\r\n+ Distinguishable characters, enviroments and games\\n\r\n+ Truly shines at the games being played and portrayed\\n\r\n+ Effects and impacts are meaningful\\n\r\n+/- The ecchi part might make some doubt, others don't\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n+ Game-themed\\n\r\n+ One of the best OPs out there\\n\r\n+ Really emphasizes the situation at hand\\n\r\n+ Great voice acting\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n+ Lovable characters\\n\r\n+ Interesting protagonists\\n\r\n+ Excellent portrayal of the bond between Sora & Shiro\\n\r\n+ Our heroes' flaws are fascinating and adds to character-development\\n\r\n+ Perfect amount of characters in the cast\\n\r\n+/- The side-characters' development is focused on skill, rather than emotion. Except for one part of our 'main' side-character\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n+ Every game is interesting\\n\r\n+ Every twist has impact\\n\r\n+ You wanna know how [BLANK] is gonna win, rather than if\\n\r\n+ Left me wanting more, hopefully giving more in the future\\n\\n\r\nAs of right now, this show is in second place in my favourite-list, only topped by a tie between Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Your Lie in April and stand ahead (on my own personal favourites list) of the mighty Attack on Titan. That's how good and refreshing this anime truly is.\\n\\n\r\nThink games were there to ONLY decide the winner? Think again!\\n\r\nASCHENTE!!!\\n\\n\r\n- Just your average-everyday anime-viewer.\\n\r\n//VoidX",

I have been in love with this series ever since it began airing.\r\nThe main idea of the series isn't really new actually however the way its executed is really amazing if not perfect.\r\nStory: 10\r\nWell, the overall story is about two foster siblings who get transferred to the other world after they defeat a certain person in a chess game. Unlike the other similar story who the main character often seek a way to get back home, the two of them is willingly stayed there and do not search a way to get back home. The world itselfis interesting, which everything in that world is decided using games.This show also smart on its own way, especially the way the siblings use to win the game is really smart and interesting on its own.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nOne word: Unique. It is colorful and beautiful. Detailed. The art will pleased your eyes, I think.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nActually nothing too special.

They delivered it well, the VA, the script too, so that's what matter.\\n\r\nYou also won't hate the characters and actually will be rooted for them as the show go on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nPerfect ten! I really enjoy this show and its never let me down. Funny, Sweet and at the same time tense. Great!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nAs the show comes to the end, I decide to give it a full mark. I think madhouse done a really great job. The show has everything I want from a great story, a interesting character, funny moment, moment of disbelief, surprises, twists, all of that! I hope there will be a second season as they left the series with a cliffhanger ending. But that too a twist. Smart watch, an amazing series from the beginning to the end.",

            "content": "The world of No Game No Life begins as two sibling NEETs are thrown into another world vastly different from our own. Between the two of them, they are the greatest gamers on planet earth, but they inhabit a single avatar known as 'Blank', who has never lost a single game. The world that they are thrown into revolves around conflicts being settled by playing games. The two siblings believe that this world is where they truly belong\r\nStory:\r\nIm gonna be frank here, the story of this anime isn't really all that great, because theres not much of one to being with. The idea of averagepeople being thrown into a new world is not anything new for anime. And although the story does pick up a couple episodes in just kind of unrolls like a carpet. It's not a bad plot by any means just a little lackluster. If you're into the really plot heavy story's, be careful if you check this one out.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis anime has very different art style from other anime. It uses very bold outlines and colors that almost remind of Borderlands. They also throw in references to things like Phoenix Wright and Doremon in the animation. Its very visually appealing and charming.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI always feel like theres not alot to talk about when it comes to sound but here it goes. As almost always I watched this anime dubbed and I was very pleased with the english voice cast. All the characters voices fit their personalities very well. It was even more impressive considering some of the characters had strange ways of speaking. The OST was also very pleasant and it used some goofy yet appropriate sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nNow heres where I thought things really shined. First off the two main characters are fantastic. We already know from the beginning that they have a genius level intellect but some of things they pull of were mind blowing. As the anime progresses their party grows (almost like an RPG) with a vast difference of characters who all manage to bring fun and excitement. There was honestly no one that I would call bad, or even boring. Each of them get several spotlight moments throughout the show so matter who your favorite is you are sure to pleased in that department.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis gets a solid 8/10 for a reason. First off its a very easy show to jump into and get started. The action starts almost immediately as the anime begins and were already given fun characters to cheer on. With the colorful and almost comic book art style, coupled with the great OST and superb voice cast, its both visually and audibly appealing. Most of the episodes end on an epic cliffhanger, which makes you want to start the next one up right away. I feel like the lack of plot and serious scenes knocks a few points off, but either way its still a very fun and enjoyable watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI had a great time watching this anime and I suggest it to those who are looking for fun filled adventure, with a great cast of characters. Again with the enjoyment, I feel the lack of plot and overall goofiness of this anime means I had to chip away from a perfect 10, but an 8 is still a very good score.\\n\\n\r\n*Favorite Character\\n\r\nThis one caught me off guard, because when I usually call someone my favorite character, rarely does it change. But I called it a little too early in this case. When the younger of the siblings named Shiro first opened her mouth, I wanted to put her in a box and take her home with me. She was just so adorable. But when Jbril, a later character joins the party, my mind slowly but surely shifted. Jbril is just so... I dont know how to describe her and thats probably why shes my favorite. You just never know how shes going to do something so she keeps the surprises coming. Also her fascination with the main character is already a trait that she shares with some of my other anime favorites. Jbril and all her oddities will certainly hold a special place amongst my other favorites.\\n",

            "content": "First of all I have to say; thanks to Christina Aguilera! Because of her I got through the entire Anime. (I was listening her music all the time, especially \"Dirrty\"). But I was still able to catch the point of the story.\r\n- Sora and Shiro are hikikomori siblings who don't care for the real world, but dominate any game when they work together as \"Blank.\" -\r\nThis should be enough introduction I suppose. Some may say it's a \"must watch\" for everyone who's fallen in love with all kind of video games. \r\nWell, I myself am a fan of videogame, yet I admire \"real\" games evenmore. Poker or chess for instance.\\n\r\nSo I should like this anime(?); however, I do not at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself would be quite interesting. In fact, after the first reviews I've read, my expectations were on a fair level I think. And even my first impression wasn't so bad.\\n\r\nBut yet, I noticed after the first few minutes how incredibly boring the anime turned out to be. Especially because of the two main protagonists - Sora and Shiro. They are incredibly talented kids - full of skills and their only \"weakness\" is apparently that they have to be together... all the time. Otherwise, they behave ridiculously strange!\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion there's another problem. How they actually win all the games. It is sort of \"Oops, I did it again\" (Thanks Britney for this line - now it makes absolutely sense.)\\n\r\nTherefore, you undoubtedly know the kids will win every single game no matter what! They bet something, literally their lives, and win of course; otherweise, the serie would come to an abrupt ending...\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly believe that the anime is totaly overhyped, in any ways you can even think of. Still, there are a plenty of animes out there which are far worse than NGNL actually is. Yet I must confess the beginning was decently entertaining; nevertheless, I'd rather be watching a show which keeps what it's promised.",

            "content": "No Game No Life, one of the most anticipated anime of this spring 2014 season.  Originally, reading the synopsis, I thought that this show would be quite an interesting watch, as the idea behind it is quite different than practically everything this season, and the initial artwork of it look stunning in this vibrant art style.  Little did I know, that this little hopeful turned out to be a game-based version of Death Note.  \r\nStory (7.96/10):  The story of NGNL as it's better known in an acronym form is about two step siblings named Sora and Shiro.  Better known asBlank in our world, these two NEETs, or intense gamers have been known to absolutely wreck basically any sort of game that exists in the world.  (MOBA's, MMO's, Puzzle, Online chess, etc.)  One day, during their normal gaming sessions, a random online chess match appears, and the duo, locked in heavy combat (through online chess), finally win against the mysterious player, only to find themselves transported through their computer screens, and into the land of Disboard.  (Yes, it is actually called that).  There, they are welcomed by the god of the world, Tet, told the essentials of the new world they are in, (called the 10 pledges), and are sent out on their own to live their lives in this new world.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I find quite interesting about this anime, is the fact that usually, when characters are transported into a strange new world, they usually want to escape it somehow.  (Zero No Tsukaima, SAO, Accel world, Digimon, etc.)  These characters, don't want to.  Like log Horizon, these characters choose not to find a way out of the new place they're in, which I find to be a much more interesting plot line than the generic, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!\\n\\n\r\nWhat I find most troubling about the story in this anime, is the fact of how slow and dragging it takes to really get anywhere.  From the beginning you sort of get a sense of what the main goal of the series for these two characters are, but you never really get to know their true goal till about halfway through the series.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this anime follows a very similar plot line to Death Note, where the characters plan every step of their next move before executing it, which actually was a nice surprise considering the fact that the synopsis doesn't give that impression at all.  Back to my original point, the plot line is similar to Death Note, where the characters for the most part look at all of the possibilities and take every precaution before even moving an inch.  This is all fine and dandy, but it causes the show a bit of downfall, because it was just too slow.  About 2/3 of the actual anime itself is put into this planning phase where the characters research, think, and what have you in order to create their next move.  And while the plan itself was quite stunning and \"well done\" worthy, I felt as though the show itself just had an uneven pacing where they dragged on the planning portion of the show and rushed through the actual game itself.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the pacing of the show was quite uneven in terms of balance, the show did provide nice comedy tidbits in order to keep the show interesting for viewers during its \"planning phase.\"  The majority of the comedy falls on, for the majority of the show, fanservice, and it's funny.  Because our main protagonist is a 18 year old pervert who has had little to no contact with women outside of his little sister, things get, well...interesting.  And also, because of the fact that the two main characters are NEETs, the idea of coming in contact with people comes up as a fear to them, creating some pretty funny moments.  \\n\\n\r\nFor an ending, the show is obviously incomplete.  The entire goal of the two main characters has barely even been achieved by the time the season has ended.  In fact, the series ends in a quite annoying cliffhanger.  If the series does not get a season 2, than this ending is the worst thing that could've happened.  But, if it does get a season 2, than things can be forgiven.  (Only when the next season comes out though.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, NGNL has a pretty damn good story to it.  The pacing issue made it a bit strange due to how uneven it was depending on what part of the show you were watching, but in all fairness, that can for the most part be ignored due to the fact that the comedy of the show, as well as the fact that the plots that the characters make are so good, that you would probably wouldn't care anyway.  (Hope for Season 2!)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Twist on new world idea\\n\r\n+  Death note-like storyline to make a twist\\n\r\n+  Great comedy (although slightly perverted.)\\n\r\n+  Good amount of IRL game references\\n\r\n+/-  Cliffhanger ending.  (Good if there will be a second season.  Bad if there won't be.)\\n\r\n-   Uneven pacing throughout the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.89/10):  What I think NGNL also exceeds in is the fact that it has a great deal of not only great characters, but memorable ones.  \\n\\n\r\nUp first is Sora, the more \"people\" side of the gamer tag \"Blank\" that he and his sister share, where he deals with the reactions of people and the possible movements that people make in order to make his next move.  (like seeing if someone's hand twitches or eye move when playing someone in poker.)  Sora is like an anti-hero character like Light Yagami, except less bloodthirsty on what he wants to achieve, and more perverted than his funny backwards last name counterpart.  Sora is a character that thinks things through, and is always willing to take \"risks\".  I call them \"risks\" in quotes because technically, the things he bets aren't exactly going to escape his grasp regardless of the circumstance.  On a more comical side, this character is a pervert.  Longing for a girlfriend himself, Sora uses some pretty conniving ways get a girl for himself.  (Reference episode 2.)  \\n\\n\r\nOn the opposite side of \"Blank\", is Shiro, the adorable 11 year old girl that no matter what you do, will beat your ass in whatever game you play.  Unlike Sora, Shiro focuses more on the \"intellectual\" side of games, where she is the one playing the moves in the game itself, due to having an intellect far higher than any scientist or genius ever to exist in recorded history.  I find her interesting due to the fact that even though she has this intellect, she only uses it when her brother asks her to, following his plots and plans to the point that it seems like a brother complex...  Well, we don't have to worry about that.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen you put these two together, the two become an inseparable pair.  (I'm not kidding.  If you separate them, they become completely different people.)  The combination of these two characters make quite an interesting group, as essentially, they cannot lose.  They literally, cannot lose.  \\n\\n\r\nApart from the two main characters, we have a whole host of side characters, all of which are practically women, leading me to believe that this is some sort of twisted harem.  Stephanie, who seems the most out of place due to the fact that she is the most sensible character in the entire series.  (We don't need common sense here!) Jibril, who is a flugel that is both a sadist and a masochist it seems.  Kurami, who seems to have a bust complex.  (I don't blame her, have you seen the females in this series?)  And, Izuna-tan!  My favorite out of the entire cast!  (Sorry, fanboyed a little bit there.)  All of these characters are exceedingly well done and very memorable.  All factors that made the show quite well-made and good.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Well detailed and great main characters\\n\r\n+  Excellently made supporting characters\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (9.20/10):  Madhouse, thank you.  Not only for helping create Fire Emblem Awakening, but also for making the artwork for this series, because it...is...amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like a lot about the art in the series, is the fact that it legitimately is a style that is all of its own.  Everything from its characters, its backgrounds, everything, is just so vibrant and bright, to the point that all of it looks like it's in neon.  It is so eyegougingly bright, that it fits so well with what the insanity and inner workings of the madman that is our main protagonist, Sora.  Even when the show decides to go comedic with chibis, the bright style remains, showing that they do retain the color and style regardless.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of art, the show does have an ecchi tag to it.  And, with my previous mention of the females of this show, aha...yeah, there are a good chunk of female characters with rather large chests.  On occasion, the show does do showering scenes, where the girls of the series go an take a bath together.  Usually, something goes wrong, and well, thing turn a bit weird.  There's even a specific episode where the character Jibril just bares it all, sitting there with her chest out for everyone to see like it's no big deal.  Unlike most ecchi shows, the fanservice is not overwhelming.  In fact, it seems to be that breed of ecchi, that is required.  It doesn't take over the show, and it doesn't go too overboard in what it wants and does not want to show.  For me, this was a tolerable amount, since it did not hinder the show in any way.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of sound, well, it's awesome.  Like many other shows this season, NGNL has a great soundtrack, with its opening \"This game\" being its flagship song.  This song is awesome.  It gives a whimsical feel to the magic that is the show, before dropping it into a rock-style sound, giving a tone of ambition akin to Sora, that works very, very well.  This is definitely a song worth listening to over and over again.  On the other hand, we have the ending, a more softer and more musical style of song that retains to Shiro, and her love for her brother.  Personally, I found both of these tracks to be very well executed, and a great listen to whenever I need motivation for something.  (Because the opening is awesome.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Unique and very colorful artstyle\\n\r\n+  Fanservice not too overpowering\\n\r\n+  Very memorable tracks\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9.87/10):  I had high expectations for this show, I really did.  As with hyped shows, if it lives up to the hype, than it is a good show.  This show certainly fulfilled a great deal of that.  While yes, I had a problem with how the story was portrayed, what with it being mostly planning than actually playing any games, I didn't mind it due to the fact that the characters, whom were the stars of the show, made these boring phases seem more vibrant and more enjoyable to watch.  NGNL is a great show in the sense that it fulfills a lot of what people expected it to be, and overall did what it wanted to achieve.  While, I am still quite butthurt on the fact that the show ended on a very, very, very big cliffhanger, if the show continues to a second season, than all will be forgiven.  Until then, I will be anxiously waiting, hoping that the disappointment won't come.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that I would recommend watching.  If you're a fan of Death Note, (as I know a lot of people are), you probably will like this, as it has that sort of same  complicated thinking process that that show had.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (8.99/10)",

It has original plot, great characters, nice art and mostly - great sence of humor (little bit ecchi, immature but always makes you laugh)\r\nThe story is centered about NEET Siblings which are transfered to another world in order to dominate it and in the end challange the God to a game of Chess. Original isnt it? First season is just but a taste of the coplex world and story which will be developed in future runs. But its definitelly worth watching even if its currently incoplete.\r\nHow I said, MAIN reason which will keep you by yourscreen will be the main protgonists. Siblings Sora and Shiro who are always together, even in the bath, are so original, funny, genius and unpredictible that one must love them.\\n\r\nYes this anime has some Ecchi scenes (lots of them) F.E. with their \"Lackey\" Dora or even with Shiro and god killing weapon Jibril but they are always very funny and in the sence of the series its not offensive.\\n\\n\r\nWhat should be also mentioned is that the whole premise of the show is centered about games. Sora and Shiro also known as \"Blank\" never ever lost a single game. They are literally better than God. The anime has some great scenes (very sophisticated) when they play even some minor games like rock paper scissors but the author managed to add the feeling that even this game can affect the entire world. - Really the only other anime which has some similar sence that playing games matters and is well executed is Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion - This anime is MUST WATCH for everyone who loves humor and good original stories. I guarantee that all of you will laugh through almost entire season.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nChars 10/10\\n\r\nHumor 11/10\\n\r\nOverall 10/10",

The story doesn't rip-off any other anime I know of. The characters and the world are very unique. There's a little bit of fan service involved, but I'm sure even the girls can handle it. If you could watch Kill la Kill, this anime has like half of that amount of pandering.\r\nThe anime doesn't have a problem randomly mixing in jokes, which a lot of times just got me off guard and I burst out laughing. Theanime doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good! It also has a lot of easter eggs, although some of them require you to have a considerable amount of knowledge regarding anime or games. Everything related to the story is explained in great detail - to my surprise, I couldn't find any contradictions anywhere. Everything makes sense! It's not about whether the heroes will win (gee, of course they will), it's about how they will win.\\n\\n\r\nSo there's a girl with superb intelligence. She could speak and solve puzzle games when she was 1 year old. Anything that has a system, she can figure it out and use it to her advantage. She can calculate the probability of your possible moves in a game of chess several hundreds of steps ahead.\\n\\n\r\nHer brother might not be that smart, but his specialty is \"reading\" people. He's a manipulative bastard. He knows so well what you are thinking it's actually intimidating. He will tell you what you want to hear ad get you to do what he wants you to.\\n\\n\r\nTogether they create [blank]. The gaming group without a name. No one has ever beaten them, be it videogames, which take skill, or gambling like poker. They are a perfect combination. One day they are reborn in a fantasy world, where everything is decided by games, rather than war and killing.\\n\\n\r\nOne minor complaint might be that sometimes the explanations of their strategies and the rules is sometimes too fast and you can't absorb all of that right away.",

            "content": "Have you ever been completely and utterly bored by something you love doing so much? It is without saying that with too much love, too much fun, too much happiness--everything eventually seems rather dull.\r\nAfter all, when one has been unbeatable for so long, and all opponents seem so easy, why would anyone bother to try? \r\nIn No Game No Life, for the siblings and main characters Shiro and Sora, their case for boredom lies in their only source of entertainment--games. With a fabulous record of zero games lost, their arrogance causes them to fall into a trap world, where the two neets are thrown intoa society where everything is decided by games.\\n\\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - \\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, NGNL by Yuu Kamiya proves an excellent backdrop for entertainment. After all, entertainment is the keyword to the whole anime. Moments of serious discussion and intelligent thought regarding \"silly games\" gives way to a blurt or outburst of perversion on Sora's part. These occasions of comedy that ensue are promising but few in number, while much ranting and explanation of the games are prevalent throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the plot is not completely original, but still refreshing in light of the more narrow-minded survival anime that exists. In a way NGNL has its on take on Survival-anime, and yet, at the same time, does not exactly fall under that category. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is advanced using a series of games that often feel long-winded and may cause some viewers to fall asleep. Regardless, due the pace of the series vs. the actual content in the Light Novels, this anime and its season ending gives a small foreshadow of a second season. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, Sora and Shiro remain mostly static throughout the work. Genius combined with Analytical Intelligence and utter Confidence results in a tag team that need not change. Other characters, such as Steph, I would not believe to be a main character but rather a supporting one in that she does nearly nothing to move the plot forward.\\n\\n\r\nAh, that brings to light the fan service. True, the world that Sora and Shiro is not necessarily an Asian Society, and therefore certain--erogenous zones--are more \"enhanced\" and prevalent. (I'm not saying that big is better, however). Steph is such a case, and judging with all the partial-nudity scenes the animators were trying to make a point with them. Or not, and it could just be to see if viewers get nosebleeds.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, much of the fan service is not as memorable as the plot, which is always a good thing. Except for in episode 6...but that is another story. :>\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special, standard-fare OP and ED; nothing memorable. BGM is where it should be and as such deserves a higher score. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style was excellent. Sometimes it clearly feels like the Animators had fancy art and animation just to buy time by showing all the locations and area in HD. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is no masterpiece. NGNL has its own flaws, and despite them remains overly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nNo Game No Life has earned a place in my heart, and I hope that through my review I might cause you to watch it and have it earn a place in your heart as well :P\\n\\n\r\nFolks, give it up for Kamiya Yuu's No Game No Life, the imperfect but nevertheless beautiful work.\\n\\n\r\n4.5 out of 5 stars for the excellently animated and entertaining No Game No Life! \\n\\n\r\n-Jay\\n\\n",

            "content": "No Game No Life, the controversial anime of Spring 2014. Some call it a masterpiece, and rate it a 10/10. Others rate it 6 and claim that it's overrated. So which really is it? Well, in order to decide that, you'll have to watch the anime yourself, but here's my view on the anime. It's neither a masterpiece, nor bad at all. In fact, it's rather an enjoyable anime that I believe everyone should give a try. I'd rate it around an 8/10, which surprisingly only a few people seem to rate it. \r\nFirst off, the plot was the part that I enjoyed about thisanime. Of course, recently there have been a plethora of anime that's concept is being trapped in a virtual game/world but No Game No Life's was quite different. But a game where, there's no actual fighting and dying, it's just a world where everything is decided upon by... a game. I mean think about it, a world where everything, including nation's territories, the king of a country, all the money, anything at all was decided on by playing one simple game. Whether it's chess, poker, or anything else, the game's stakes are pretty insane. What the main characters do to win each game is something that's interesting to watch out for. Each nation is considered a piece of a chess board (16 pieces total). The nation that unites all the other nations (by defeating them in games) and collects all the chess pieces on the board gets the opportunity to challenge God, Te, who united all the Gods. \\n\\n\r\nOur main characters, the two genius NEET siblings, Sora and Shiro aka \"Blank\" views our real world as just another pathetic game (they have a point). Everyday life for kids just repeats itself, and in society not everybody accepts you for who you are. One day they get invited to a chess match by a stranger (Tet), and after a good amount of time (1 min) they defeat him and are suddenly sent into the world where everything is decided by games. Here, Sora and Shiro play games and try to become the King/Queen of the human race, and end up setting their goal as uniting all the nations/races together and defeating God, and becoming perhaps God theirselves. Sora is such a funny teenager. He seems to be quite the pervert (since he is still a virgin that wants to lose his virginity) and goofer despite him being a genious gamer. That added a less serious, more enjoyable aspect to the anime. Shiro on the other hand kind of annoyed me, because she was a 11 year old girl, whose panties were shown all over the anime; very disturbing. The other characters were interesting, but very confusing and annoying at the same time. I mean Steph is dumb and annoying one episode, then the next episode is smart and kind, but then switches around all the time. PICK ONE PERSONALITY. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending for NGNL are both one of my favorites respectively. Truly amazing music in the anime, I'd definitely tell you to look out for the great soundtrack, and Sora's voice fit him perfectly, as did every single other character. The art was decent. That's all I'll mention about the art.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this anime was just above average I'd say. I had expected a lot more considering it's recent hype, and high ratings, but nonetheless it was an enjoyable experience that I'd recommend to everyone, all ages.",

            "content": "This will be a spoiler free review so no need to worry, this is my first review so please bear with me.\r\nWell to begin starting this like most other people I thought it was going to be a Sword Art Online reboot but to my surprise they don't want to escape the game, they want to stay in this world so it was nice to see a spin on this often played story.\r\nStory (7)- the story is simple enough for anyone to understand but also goes into depth for people who enjoy those types of shows so it pleases both audiences which i think alot of animes can learn from this. But sadly the story and atmosphere of this serious situation is taken as a joke and once the the mood is serious the vibe is always shattered with a lame joke and i feel it's often distracts the story telling. I do enjoy anime that can successfully balance humor and story telling but this is not one of those animes, timing is everything and i feel this is something the anime needed.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9)- The art is very fun and pretty to look at and for sure has a signature look to it which i think anyone who watches a lot of anime can appreciate, nothing more to say than this. I have no complaints about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8)- Nothing notable with the exception of intense situations and having a very intense and fitting song. Other than this I didn't notice any other ost tracks that stuck out to me, just casual background music to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7)- Okay so I probably had the hardest time judging this section because my personal view of the characters vary so so much and given a solid score from certain characters that score as low as a 4 and others who score as high as a 8, it just makes it hard to give an accurate score. Without giving spoilers to future characters of the series I'll just talk about Sora and Shiro. Well firstly Sora is very annoying and very sweet sometimes, I personally never liked the perv character so he was bound for me not to like him but he does have a sweet side and a strong leader trait that makes him a great person to follow as long as he's not being an idiot. Now the genius Shiro is adorable to watch and her emotionless voice to go along with her colorful personality is just so much fun to watch, for sure one of the best characters in the series, only complain would be just less panty shots of her, like seriously, she's 11 years old, how hasn't a law suit been filed against this shit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7)- What a roller coaster this anime was, for me it went from boring to exciting back to boring for an ep or two then exciting then the final game at the start being boring then ending on a high note which was probably the best moment of the show so overall it just left me confused on how to feel about it. This anime has it's moments and when it does it becomes very exciting and if you feel really sucked into the show but when the show becomes boring it's -very- boring and it just feels like I'm watching this just to say i finished it. In short, it has it's moments of both being great and horrible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7)- The strong points of this anime are incredible and the weak points of this anime is just torture to watch. So many mixed feelings of this but overall i don't regret watching this and if there is a season 2 I will most likely watch it.",

            "content": "Recipe for No Game No Life: 1: Start with your typical kingdom plot where the underdog kingdom takes over the entire world. 2: Create a main character who you can wholeheartedly believe would do that. 3: Turn it into a harem anime. 4: Take that harem anime and make the main character into the exact opposite of the stereotypes. 5: Have those characters take part in extremely complex and unfair games like in Gamble Fish or Hunter x Hunter, with literally anything on the line. 6: Have them win those games with insanely complex strategies, a la Death Note or Code Geass (all while grinningand being their usual pervert selves) 7: top it all off with a beautiful art style and flawlessly integrated music, both of which are used and changed intentionally and to great effect. 8: Voila, you have the masterpiece that is NGNL!\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: It tries to do and be a whole bunch of different things, and succeeds phenomenally. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.99\\n\r\nThis is the only spot where NGNL fails to knock my expectations out of the park. Instead, it just scores a regular home run. Each episode is filled with turnarounds, upsets, and twists galore, but the overall plot of the anime still is, \"Let's beat all the other countries.\" The thing that keeps it from being knocked down a point is the fact that I really could see the characters doing that. The main characters really are the types who would conquer the entire world just to prove they can and win. If you enjoy that type of kingdom-based plot, this is a straight 10 for you.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10+\\n\r\nThis is where this anime really shines. Out of the entire cast, there's only one character who acts like anyone I've seen before, the comic relief/fanservice punching bag/unfortunate soul, and even she is superbly executed, with enough plot and conflict to keep her from feeling like a total prop. (Instead, she just feels like a comparatively dim girl.) The rest of the cast seems to be mold-breaker after mold-breaker. Discovering the characters is a big portion of the fun of this anime, so I won't spoil it, since if I give one amusing anecdote I'll have to give them all, and leave you with a summary of the entire series, because I could go to any moment with a character on screen, and they would be in the middle of a funny story.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 10\\n\r\nFirstly, the character designs are beautiful. Second, the settings are stunning. Third, the soundtrack is subtle and perfectly accentuates the tone of the moment. Fourth... Do I really need a fourth? The art knocks just about everything out of the park (Though I admit I like the Korean art style a lot and this reminds me of it), the sound track isn't intrusive or absent, the opening and closing themes are amazing, and when they flash the screen to a different color scheme, it's because the entire world changed, not just because someone noticed something.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe best way to describe what I thought of it overall is to say that I needed to take several breaks because my throat hurt from laughing so much. If you like perverted things mixed in with the regular plot, epic battles of the mind, a lighthearted tone, and characters that feel like they came from Alice in Wonderland, you'll love this show.",

All tension has been thrown out the window. We know the main characters are gonna win, and so do they. What irks me about this is that it's telling the audience that the show is meant to be brainless entertainment, yet it's a story centered around games, wit and intelligence. I am not sure if this is idiotic or secretly genius.\r\nThe onething keeping you watching is the question of HOW they will beat their opponents, and if the show does one thing right it is the bombastic presentation of their victories. The journey there can however be improved significantly.\\n\\n\r\nI do enjoy that our sibling protagonists are pro-active and that they actually enjoy being sucked into another world, setting them apart from the typical heroes that just want to live a normal life. Their comradery is cute and their relationship is thankfully kept platonic. I can't say they ever grow as characters through the story, and I doubt they will in any potential 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a show with plenty of fun but with a shallow core.",

            "content": "I find myself having difficulty organizing my thoughts on NGNL. I wanted to write this review right after I finished the last episode, but then it would only be riding the hype-train and most likely lacking much in perspective. What needs to be said is probably covered in the multitude of other reviews for this anime so what can I write to contribute? \r\nI found myself skeptical at the concept of NGNL. At first glance, I thought it was something akin to Sword Art Online. And while I found SAO to be a decent enough watch, I don't need to see another \"clone\" of it.What finally pushed me over the edge and give it a try was due to people I can trust to give me good anime recommendations. Needless to say at this point expectations were high for NGNL to perform.\\n\\n\r\nAnd did it perform right at the very first episode. If you so much as blink while watching NGNL, you may find yourself missing some philosophical outlooks on life. The juxtaposition between these concepts and the lighthearted presentation is astounding. I'll tackle the one that resonated with me the most.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of \"the proud weak\" struck a cord deep within me. Regardless of how you put it, we are weak and always will be. Our fangs will never be as sharp as those designed by nature itself to be natural-born killers. We will always be prey, yet somehow we find ourselves at the very top of the food chain. How did this come to pass? How did our ancestors overcome this staggering difference in physical specifications? How did the prey become the apex predator while still being weak?\\n\\n\r\nLogically, most, if not all human beings understand how this came to pass. However, we don't really think about it as we believe this is a matter of course. It's natural for humanity to be at the top because that's just the way things are and always will be. There's no point thinking about something that's as natural as the air we breathe.\\n\\n\r\nYet what happens when humanity is no longer at the top? What happens when our predators have taken hold of the one thing that allowed us to lay claim to our position of power? What happens when we're back to our rightful place at the bottom, shivering in fear at the mercy of our superiors?\\n\\n\r\nNGNL tackles that question in a way one least expects. At it's core, NGNL is a narrative of the human spirit and the potential we are all capable of. And that by itself is worth watching. Everything else is just a nice bonus wrapped up in one very well presented package.",

            "content": "Spring 2014 had a lot to overcome and prove. \r\nWhy?\r\nOn March 28, 2014, a little show called Kill la Kill ended its 24 episode run, and the anime community proceeded to jump into a collective orgy of hype, memes, and skimpy cosplay. (Which I certainly did not mind.) The show became the next big thing, (Previously held by Attack on Titan) and we all wondered if any show in spring could attain even a fraction of the popularity. \r\nEnter No Game No Life.\r\nThe show features a plot that might seem like common fare these days: People in video games. Although this is not exactly thecase for NGNL, it shares many themes, such as vibrant worlds and otakuish characters. Our main characters are Sora and Shiro, a brother sister match made in heaven. Sora is the classic Light Yagami/Lelouch super genius, but replace the suaveness of those two with an undying love for a sibling, as well as being an otaku. The sister, Shiro, is quiet, but as smart as Shiro. Together, they form the collective entity of blank, gamers unbeatable in any game. Suddenly, by some twisssssted turns of events, they are summoned into a magical world of- well, you know where it goes from here. (Fight our way to the top! Huzzah!)\\n\\n\r\nOther characters include Stephanie \u201cSteph\u201d Dola, a dim witted character, used mostly for fanservice and other gags by our main heroes, and Jibril, big breasted and ready to serve. As you can tell, the characters are nothing close to revolutionary, but their interactions certainly make the show interesting. Wether it is Sora fawning over his love for Shiro, or Shiro's torture of Steph, NGNL's character interactions make for a fun time. All these characters, by the end of the series, all become lovable by the end- this is GOOD.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one great thing about the characters is that...well, they look damn good. Hell, this entire show looks damn good. One of the best looking shows I've seen in a long time. It uses a technique that has recently gained populatiry- drawing everything in a red outline. In NGNL's world, this works especially well, as the beautifully designed characters, landscapes, and buildings pop out in a fashion that makes you want to fill your room with wallscrolls of the show. (Unfortunately, I don't have one currently.) This art is poppin, yo, its GREAT.\\n\\n\r\nThe fine arts always include two things. Besides visual, music is quite important. Music for this show is done by a collective group of musicians by the name of SuperSweep. (Never heard of them.) It's a romp of exciting tunes, which certainly add to the flair of the series. However, it isn't Kaijura or Kanno level. On the topic of music, the opening song, \u201cThis game,\u201d by Konomi Suzuki, is GREAT. I be singing that all da time yo. GOOD. (sings the part of the op that goes NO GAME NO LIFEE)\\n\\n\r\nOnward to the story that I neglected to elaborate 3 paragraphs ago. Our characters are sent into a world in which everything is decided by games. Yup, no war. (Lennon would be proud?) However, this does not mean that racism and class divisions are not rampant. The world is divided into different races, ranging from monsters to ANIMAL PEOPLE YES. \\n\\n\r\n* ahem *\\n\\n\r\nSora and Shiro find themselves attempting to take over all of these races, and their respective lands, in an Oda Nobunaga style unification. Unlike Nobunaga, however, they must win games agains the best of the best in each country to finally make their way to the ultimate position to challenge GOD HIMSELF. THIS IS HYPE THIS IS NO GAME NO-\\n\\n\r\nAnd the credits roll. End of Review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWait.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWAIT.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're wondering why I prematurely ended the review, its because I wanted to provide some artistic symbolism as to how NGNL ends. Yeah, like that. I mean, one can say it's not their fault. The source material (Light novel, surprise, surprise.) started in 2012, and is ongoing. However...the ending is not acceptable. It makes you think that the next episode would have aired next week, but no...it was OVER.  No excuse for it. There are many ways you can end a show in which the original source material is still going, but this is not one of them. This is my biggest problem with NGNL. Its pretty glaring. BAD.\\n\\n\r\n* takes deep breath *\\n\\n\r\nWell, now that that is over, did NGNL successfully kill Kill la Kill. Noo. But is it damned good? Yeah. Yesyesyes watch it cause its good and steph is so god damn- \\n\\n\r\nVERY GOOD 8/8 MATE (8/10)\\n\\n",

            "content": "First and foremost, many people have decided to either not watch or drop  no Game no Life solely on the fact that it is similar to Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? The similarity is much as SAO is to Log Horizon. And being similar does not necessitate being bad. I personally found NGNL and  Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? to have completely different mood and execution despite the similarities.\r\nSTORY:\r\nI found No Game No Life to be a very interesting story that is both laid back and serious at the same time (in a funny way). As youmay know, the 2 main protagonists,Sora and Shiro, are summoned to to a alternative world, by the God of games(play), Tet. In this world war and fighting is banned and everything is to be resolved by games. I believe this is where the real meat of the show is. The games are exaggerated and blown up to such a level that every minute through  you are mentally saying \"is this actually happening\".  The writing for these games are absolutely genius. While people may complain, as they always do, about how there is flaws in these games, it is precisely these flaws that create the opportunities to make the games so unbelievable (in a good way). Your in a game world, where ally you can do is play games, im sure people can come up with wacky and illogical solutions to a problem, especially Sora ans Shiro who have played games their entire life. Also despite what other people say about the plot, I believe the games itself are a major part of the plot. If you understand what i means you will see the games itself are the story. The only problem I faced with the story is they try to do too much at the same time. playfulness, adventure, humor, fan service etc. I would say stick with one or 2 main categories and develop those.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.37/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nThe art fits the characters and the story perfectly. The bright vivid pinks along with the illogical bright warm colors continuously remind you this is a game world, or this itself is a game if you want to think about it more deeply. Part of the reason why I think the protagonists can do crazy stuff is because this feels like a game, a open free world where you can do almost anything. The art gives you that feeling and atmosphere. I also like how the characters curves, vectors and shading felt more 2D than 3D. I also like how they did not take the characters to super high definition despite the technology. Now imagine of the character quality looked similar to strike the blood or some other high Def anime.  The art style reminded me of log Horizon, which i really, really prefer in this sort of anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.82/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nby far the characters are the weakest. So far the anime has mainly shown static characters. Meaning Characters that do not change. It is still early in the anime so this could change. We were introduced to Shiro and Sora as super good (god-like) at game, with high intelligence and logic deduction capabilities and that has not changed through out the anime.Now static does not necessitate bad. Mikasa from Attack on Titan is a static character yet is a complete badass.  Both of them are also bad with crowds, hence them being NEETS. I dont want to spoil, but there were problems with the core of the characters during the speech and ill leave it at that. One of the characters is truly a dumb dumb and made for fan service. Now this may a be both a good thing and a bad thing. Now Sora and Shiro have taken advantage of this a few times but in the end i feel that character will just get boring after a while (unless he/she changes).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  7.58/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI love it. I find a good show, not when it has a good story or character or music (though those are great to have). A good anime is one that engages me to a point that i start to forget about the negatives. No show will be perfect but great shows hide their imperfection. PS i did not steal this quote, i came up with it on the spot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:   between 9.4 & 9.6 /10  \\n\\n",

            "content": "No Game No Life is a story about Sora, an 18 year old man and he's 11 year old Shiro and together they known as Blank, a undefeated team of gamers. After game there between the two of them, playing as four different characters at the same time and beat over 1000 gamers, they get challenged by someone name Tet to a game of Chess. After being Tet, He offers the two to a world where games replace war, thinking it's a joke they accept and transported to the world of Disboard. Tet reveals that he the god of this world and explains the rulesof his world, the Ten Pledges and tell them to enjoy themselves. I would keep going, but i feel like that enough about the story as i don't want to spoil anything. The story has been well written as i could find anything in show to contradict itself as some time so animes do, so i happy this wasn't the case. The story itself has a lot of think to keep you guessing thats going to happen next and really show you how important the main characters are to each other.\\n\r\nNext the design, No Game No Life seen to follow the art style of other animes like Sword Art Online in turns of color and design. This art style really makes the anime stand out as the details in the characters and the environments are well created and make the show come to life. The sounds are also been well made as all the background sounds and music fit whats happening on screen very good and helps make the anime more alive. Last part of design is the characters, all the characters' design has been well-thought-out as the detail on the characters is some the best i seen in an anime. The voices of every character in the show worked very well as not once i thought that - oh that voice doesn't sound to good or oh i don't think you should of gave them that voice, but thats my opinion so you may think differently.\\n\r\nLastly my thoughts about No Game No Life, I found that i really enjoy this as it has the look of Sword Art Online and the detail of Log Horizon but able to do these better than both. The characters have been so well created that you can really understand and care for them as they don't feel lifeless, and the art and music makes it come to life. The story will make you feel that you want to see the next episode.\\n\r\nSo that in mind i say that No Game No Life is a well created and one of the most interesting anime i ever seen, I recommend it to anime lovers who watch Sword Art Online and Log Horizon and to people new to anime as it one of the best animes out there and to start getting into anime.",

            "content": "No game no life is one of my favorite anime in this season as it have good ideas and many memorable event.\r\nStory- The drifters who drifted into the fantasy world with game as part of the diplomacy, warfare and ideology is fresh. The overall story is plain and don't have many moment to pray protagonist to beat the villain. But details of the game, tricks that have been used make many memorable moments in this anime, good job. 10/10\r\nArt- The world of game is very beautiful as what fantasy world should be. It's also surprising to see towns of individual races. And what I likethe most is the screenplay, it's easily make the bland character's bibliography look interesting. But I feel like some character doesn't look very good eg. Shiro. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- Some characters have very annoying voice. I really annoyed Kurami voice , her high pitched sound really screeching like drawing blackboard with chalks. But thanks to every VA that they had captured every characters personality and what they have to do. This make corny jokes become memorable events. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The character setting possibility play the great role in the story. Unique personality of main characters really got me. However, Sora personality can be annoying as well as memorable, as some of his speech is awful. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- As above said, I'm very enjoy watching this series and I would watch if it have second season. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall- It have many awful and awesome moment in this anime. But the awful one isn't the main part of the story. So I recommend this anime to anyone who get bored with fantasy world with knights, dragons, brave protagonist and  etc. 9/10",

            "content": "This is the anime where everyone reccomends to their friends and call what their friends watch as \"shit\". The anime where the fanbase is more aggressive and nasty than the SAO fanbase. The anime where people lose their friendships more than they did to monopoly. Yes, that is No Game No Life. The anime where Madhouse was in charge of, and of course one of the most overhyped and overrated series that was released in 2014\r\nStory:5\r\nYep, the story is mediocre, there I said it. Come at me butthurt fans. The story is nothing original, the main character gets teleported to another world and has tofight stuff (in this case they had to fight with games), there are a lot of animes where it involves transporting to another world, Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?, Ixion Saga DT, Dog Days, and many more, but why did this get more attention than the other animes that involves transportation to another world? No one really knows, moving along to the synopsis. This anime is about Sora and Shiro, two siblings who have been NEETs, hikikomori, otakus, whatever you prefer, for their entire lives. These two have been known as gaming prodigies who can beat anyone in no time, but one day they suddenly get a Chess challenge from an unknown player and face them. The game went on for hours and hours until Sora and Shiro finally won, but once they won there was an email that suddenly popped up with a bunch of questions that were asking them about their life and suddenly get transported into another realm. As they get transported there they meet a girl named Stephanie Dola, the granddaughter of the Imanity King,(romanized version of her name, since there is no L in the japanese alphabet, so i heard) and help her fix the Imanity kingdom due to her grandfathers mistakes. This is basically a summarization of the first episode and there's more to cover, but I'm pretty sure nobody wants to read so much.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nThe art was to the point where you could ejaculate multiple times just from seeing the opening. The art was just beautiful, you got to see vibrant colors glistening on each character and just everything. The art was on-point well done by Madhouse, they have the best art honestly.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nGreat, great opening This Game by Konomi Suzuki potrayed what the anime was basically going to be about and pumped you up for the series itself. Some sounds throughout the anime felt like it was reused from Mahou Sensou (the piece of trash that tainted Madhouse), but I'm not so sure. I'm not too keen with my ears anymore.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:5\\n\r\nThe characters were honestly not flat, but not dynamic at the same time either. Sora being a badass was great, Shiro being the smart loli that everyone loves, Stephanie being the drama queen that makes the series more \"intense\", and Jibril being the comedy relief yet the fan service provider at the same time. The voice actor for Sora, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, who voiced in Sword Art Online, Aboslute Duo, and many more potrayed Sora very well. I have nothing to say about the rest since I don't know much else about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7\\n\r\nThis was definitely one of those animes that made me pumped throughout each week for every new episode. Though it went downhill as soon as the \"Izuna Arc\" ended, I saw it coming since the series was coming to an end, but still I felt a bit heart broken when the series ended.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the overhyped and overrated series in 2014, ask someone what the best anime they've seen is and I'm 69% sure they'll reply back with \"OF COURSE IT'S NO GAME NO LIFE YOU LIL SHET\" and the fanbase much more aggressive, as I said earlier in the review. The show was good, but definitely not the best. The show is a solid 7/10, but butthurt fans will come out of their caves and start bashing on me.",

            "content": "I liked and recommend this anime\r\nSome might say the big flaw in the anime is that they blatantly say that the [Blank] is unbeatable. Yes that would fizzle the tension of \"who's going to win\" but they put effort into making the actual games interesting. This made me as a viewer to really focus on their journey rather than the outcome with the definite climax at episode 7. I do feel bad though when other characters are made to look so stupid relative to Blank. \r\nThe fanservice was obvious but it was incorporated pretty seamlessly imo with the setting and tone of the show soI had no problem with it. I don't despise fanservice as a whole, just when it seems inappropriate or forced just like any other story device. I was surprised that the animation turned off some viewers because I thought the colorful atmosphere and the environment was fun to look at. Soundtrack was average but the opening was great.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I appreciate that the ending was relatively conclusive imo in that it didn't seem to beg the watchers to go to the manga. Hopefully, there will be a season 2. In conclusion, I have a positive view of this series due to right expectation management. I didn't expect anything compelling but it surprisingly did go the extra mile to really delve into the journey/analysis of the games.",

            "content": "No Game No Life is an anime about a duo, brother and sister, who are NEETs and completely own everything in the game world that they are suddenly tossed into, by this dude called 'Tet'. But the specifics aren't important, let's jump straight into why this anime is downright awesome but makes absolutely no sense at all.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe entire plot is actually not very deep, but to be fair, it only had 13 episodes to it, and I'm expecting a sequel so I can't say much about how complete it is. The originality behind it though, simple genius. The anime at first may not seemto take itself seriously with all the ecchi scenes, which I do find unnecessary, but when it comes to the type of games being played, this script really shines. If you appreciate the science (and art) behind game theory and mechanics, you will absolutely love the story and the type of games going on in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhere it falls short, however, is of course, that the anime doesn't actually seem to be heading in any purposeful direction other than \"I want to beat God\". But I guess, that's fine for me since it's only 13 episodes. I can't say there are any plot twists, because everything is predictable except for exactly how the main characters win. And when you figure out how they win you'll just either be blown away or just dumbfounded (and slightly cheated) by the way Blank wins almost every single game.\\n\\n\r\nI have to minus points for the fact that although the plot was really shining in the first few episodes, when it came to the part about the Reversi game with Kurami, they completely glossed over exactly how Blank managed to beat Kurami in reversi anyway. Suddenly we see Shiro placing 3 pieces in a row (in this game I thought it was turn-based?) and somehow winning the game despite being unable to even see the board.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major draw back was that in the end, the method in which they defeated the \"ultimate game\" was slightly too far off to believe it would actually work. Even if Shiro could calculate, it doesn't mean she had absolute knowledge about the scripts that the game was running on, so that didn't make much sense. And even if that could happen, there was completely no telling that they would arrive at the final destination at the exact timing in which the fox girl powered down.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAmazing. The art is just simple amazing. You can describe it with just one word \"Rainbows.\" Everybody is a rainbow, and the character art, background art is just beautiful. I never knew there were so many colours in the world until I watched this anime. The visuals are simply stunning.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOP anime theme is downright awesome. It's upbeat, exciting, everything you want in it. Background music excels in this anime, gets everything hyped up especially within the games. As for, the ED theme, it was pretty decent as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as enjoyable the Blank combination is as a character, and as awesome as they are, I have to minus points for the fact that every other character is basically being outplayed and outclassed by Blank, leaving little room for growth or depth in character development. Still, it was 13 episodes long, so that's understandable in every way. I absolutely love the main character though, everyone else just seems to get horribly sidelined, and I wish I could have seen more of their impact on the game. Also, Blank is quite imbalanced as a character, and literally can calculate in supercomputer proportions and seemingly impossible theorems.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPacing and everything is just right in the anime. It's exciting, it gets you hooked from the get-go, and the only thing that may turn viewers down is that they explain it a bit too fast, so some viewers may have to end up rewatching or pausing at the explanation several times before they get it, but it was pretty decent for me. Most of the laughs came out of just fanservice though, but I enjoyed the games they were actually playing. (The one they played with Jibril was notably quite hilarious).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, for a 13-episode anime, I cannot give it an overall rating above 8 because it just doesn't bring enough depth to the table. But still, a very impressive anime, and the sequel is a must-watch!",

            "content": "\"Whether were up against elves or god, Blank never loses\" ~ Sora\r\nTruer words have never been spoken.\r\nNo Game No Life(NGNL) is one of the most controversial anime in recent history. It's an anime that people either shun, or they love. And both sides have very legitimate reasons for supporting their beliefs. But is it really that good(or bad)?\r\nStory:- 7/10\r\nI, like many others, LOVE the premise of NGNL. The idea of living in a world where everything is decided by games has brilliant potential to be an amazing anime. But I feel that NGNL misused this potential. The story has two major flaws. The main characters,Sora and Shiro, are AMAZING at games. They have never lost a game in the real world and even in the new game world, they have no intention to lose, and the don't lose. EVER. \\n\\n\r\nThis makes the story extremely predictable and at times, boring. I never found the conclusion of any game to be even remotely surprising. The enjoyment doesn't come from the ending of the game, it comes from the road to reach that conclusion. Although this makes the games enjoyable it doesn't give the element of suspense that \"game\" anime need.\\n\\n\r\nIncluding the misused potential, the story feels a bit rushed. But the biggest flaw of the story is the completely inconclusive ending. It's a completely crap ending that doesn't solve anything or even give a cliffhanger. It just ends abruptly. If a second season is made, then the story probably will rise to an 8 out of a 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story has an immense amount of potential, but it's potential is completely misused due to a predictable plotline and a disgusting ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of NGNL is arguably amazing. But due to the bright nature of the show, that's debatable. The show uses an extremely high amount of pink, and before I sound like a sexist, no, the color itself doesn't bother me. But the excess of any color annoys me and this anime drops like 200 liters of pink on the screen. It caused a small strain to my eyes which did take me out of the anime. But, to be fair, the art style compliments the anime very well. It''s a very unique art style to choose out of the many that they could've.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice is what REALLY bugs me. It's abundance throughout the anime is extremely grating. While I do understand that much of the humor of the show comes from the fanservice, there still was a huge amount of fanservice, and it got in the way of the actual visuals and took my attention away from many main plot points.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of NGNL one of it's high points. The opening of the show is of very good quality and the ending is pretty good. The soundtrack is very good and each track compliments the scene they represent in the anime. The only fault I find with the soundtrack is that none of the tracks are of high quality when listened to without the visuals complimenting it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese dub of the show is, naturally, pretty good. Every voice actor does their respective character's personality justice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:- 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of NGNL is where it lacks the most. None of the characters are developed at all throughout the series. So let's look at the roster and see how bad it really is.\\n\\n\r\nSora: To define Sora, you can call him a comedic version of Light(Death Note) or Lelouch(Code Geass). He's a cocky dick, but he has complete reason to act like one. He also is obsessed with women, and is probably a pervert?\\n\\n\r\nShiro: Shiro, the sister of Sora, is an emotionless version of Sora. She can easily predict what artificial intelligence will do. And like Sora, she also can be classified as a pervert? And she's 11, by the way.\\n\\n\r\nStephanie Dola: Steph is the fanservice pig and the exposition pig of the show. She exists for the sole purpose of explaining the protagonist's plots to the viewer. It is in this way that I feel that her character was completely misused.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are all underdeveloped and bland pieces of garbage. By judging the amount I've written about the characters, you can tell that the character have no depth at all.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, aside from the god Tet, Sora and 2 others, all the other characters in the show are female. Let that sink in.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEven if the story and characters of the show are bad, the show was extremely enjoyable. It got a lot of laughs out of me and it also made me clap for the genius protagonists many times over.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n+Good premise\\n\r\n+Good music\\n\r\n+Likable main characters(Even if they are underdeveloped)\\n\r\n+Good animation\\n\r\n+Very enjoyable\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-Poor execution of the story\\n\r\n-Underdeveloped characters\\n\r\n-Art can cause strain on the eyes\\n\r\n-Horrible ending\\n\r\n-Heavily misused potential\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

I won't go over it because there is a synopsis that tells you all you need to know before watching the anime.\r\nArt\r\nDoesn't fail to impress. I first watched this as it aired, then just now started watching the bluray version. The art is even more impressive this time which also features some scenes being nearly completely redrawn. \r\nSound\r\nOpening track is great, works very well for the anime. Sound effects are noticeable and meaningful as is most of the background music.\r\nCharacter\r\nSora and Shiro areblank characters. They are easy to understand and likely will not change until [something] happens. That being said, apparently Stephanie is a main? it doesn't seem like it. Steph definitely needs a little more development. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nComedy was pretty funny. The art and the story combined can make the show seem breath-taking. There were times that I became enthralled in watching this anime, and every single savory moment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to anyone. It was totally enjoyable and very interesting to watch. Unless you crave for a certain niche, then watch this. On another note, this show doesn't leave much of an aftertaste. Although I would prioritize the second season of this show over most, it just lacks a little bit of impact, but it is still great.",

            "content": "Story: Oh, how I came across this anime was pretty...well, like how I came across any other anime actually. Before my high school career ended, I met a boy who turns out to be my college best friend, Luis, who was watching it and recommended it to me. He said that the anime was about two kids going into a world where it was all about games. Okay, something new, fine. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. The story is very interesting because the main mission is for Sora and Shiro to become the greatest gamers in the gaming world. That'sit. Nothing distracts the purpose in all twelve episodes. Though the gaming setting is not that original, it was the first time since Sword Art Online I've seen something that's not having to beat all of the levels to escape. In fact, Sora and Shiro (brother-sister duo) don't even want to escape. They hate their own world more than anything. However, most of the scenes are fan service for men. Sometimes, the only way to defeat a person in the games has to deal with fan service. Because of what I can explain, I would rate this section a 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Fan service and pedophilia is most I can say about art. My closest friends know that fan service is the one thing that destroys good anime. Most of the scenes in this anime are of Stephanie Dora's chest, almost vagina (Luis told me that the manga was full fledged nudity and to save my sanity by not reading it), and naked little girls. Why I chose to watch it? Well, I wasn't informed it was going to be that bad! Still, I like how some of the characters look with their clothes on, but it didn't strike me to be so impress. I rated this section 5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The theme song to this anime is one of my favorite theme songs of all fucking time. Luis exactly performed the song on guitar for me once, and I was very impressed. Like Ouran's ending theme, this ending song didn't impress me much either. However, I did find the little clips of young Sora and Shiro to be cute. The music for the battle scenes did bring some suspense and excitement to when it was the most important. Because of those reasons, I rated this section 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: If you want me to be honest with you, I didn't find every single character in this anime to be...likable. I mean Shiro's okay because I felt bad for her after watching her backstory. When Sora disappears, I felt even more bad for her because that was when I realized she had more personality than the tired, Wonder Bread one I saw a lot of times before. Stephanie knew what was up some of the time, but she acted like a damsel in distress for the rest of it. I almost hated Sora at first, but I came to realize that he was my favorite character in the whole series. Though he has perverted tendencies, he's really smart and he has a protective personality towards Stephanie and Shiro when they are in danger. The thing that pissed me though that I never got Sora's backstory on why he hates society back in the real world. I see him have panic attacks, but I never got the reasons why for them. I rate this section 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As far as enjoyment goes, I wouldn't get too excited about this show. I guess it's all about preference, but I wouldn't rewatch this if I was forced to. There were some occasions when I just wanted to get rid of this show off of my watching list, but there was something that made me watch all twelve episodes just to see what happened. Would I want a second season of this show since it left on such a cliffhanger? Probably not, but I don't know just yet. I rate this portion a 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Again, it's all about preference. If you guys want to see No Game No Life for yourselves, I won't stop you. After putting numbers together (God, I hate Math.), the overall rating for this show to me is 7 out of 10. I do have to say that if you're really against fan service, especially if it's girls having to show their privates to get viewers, don't watch this. You'll be pissed off all of the time.",

            "content": "No Game No Life was a hell of an adventure. Even with a semi-predictable/generic setting, the execution and phrasing of everything was simply brilliant. Everything seemed to be timed and packed with suspense so that there wasn't even a moment when I thought, \"Man, when will this monologue finish?\"\r\nI would be giving this anime a perfect ten if only the development as a whole was as steady as the phrasing of the plot. What I mean is that it almost seemed inconsistent on the amount of attention every character got. It was very bland in terms of the roles the characters played. Sora and Shirowas the good guys, Kurami was the tsundere, Steph/Jibril were the fanservice etc.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem about the show (at least from my perspective) was the overemphasis of the fanservice. Now I'm not saying fanservice is a bad thing, but is it really appropriate to put so much of it in No Game No Life to the point where it distracts the viewer from the main plot?\\n\\n\r\nMy last problem I had with NGNL was the fact that the show itself treated the viewers like they were stupid. Although I have to admit that I couldn't keep up with everything going on, I at least would feel better if Sora had stopped using monologues/Steph as a 3rd party device for the viewer to understand what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, NGNL gets a solid 9 from me. The major overarching problem is just that it wasn't very sure of it's audience. From my point of view, I can't really tell if NGNL was supposed to be an ecchi fantasy harem or a brilliant show for people who want to put their minds to the test a bit.\\n\\n\r\nWell, thanks for reading! I know my arguments were slightly inconsistent, but  I'm still very happy that you took the time to read my review!\\n\\n",

I did really enjoy this series, but there was some strangeness going on here.\r\nThere are tons of glowing reviews about this thing, which i believe comes down to an eerie similarity to Gurren Lagann's main character and the main character for this anime.  Personally, I didn't like Gurren Lagann at all.   It was too extreme and cheesy for me to handle.  and it leapt through time faster than i could keep up, so it got dropped.\r\nStrike one: using a beloved archetype forMC\\n\\n\r\nAt times i felt the art was way to saturated, making it almost painful to look at.  The colors were way to extreme for me to appreciate.  The art over all wasn't the greatest, but dayum the fluidity was pretty amazing with the animation.  It definitely saved the day imo.\\n\\n\r\nStrike two:  hodor!\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, I picked this show up b/c of the high praise that reached my ears.  I was highly skeptical after reading the premise, but decided there must be something special inside.  And most anime has terrible premises but they never slow a good show down.  And when a show has a great premise (Naruto) well....fillers and poop.  But onward frens to strike 3!!!!\\n\\n\r\nTHIS ANIME IS A CARBON COPY OF Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\\n\r\nmyanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo\\n\\n\r\nSo its basically the same show.  It's not \"like\" Mondaiji, it IS Mondaiji with different characters.  One show got CRAPPED all over for the MC being way to over powered, the other show is being heralded as ANIME OF THE DECADE.  So forgive me for being a little confused, especially as a big fan of Mondaiji ~.  With that said, since i liked Mondaiji alot, and am still very sad there is no sequel, i did very much enjoy No Game No Life.  Its impossible to like one and not the other.  Or is it?  \\n\\n\r\nStrike three:  Plagiarism\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, i'm just surprised by the reception of this anime.  I thought there was some interesting things in it, i liked the pacing alot, i liked the mind games and puzzles, it was just really interesting.  But the one serious critique is that it's a show that you know exactly where its going.  you just don't know how it gets there.  Not my favorite type, but they did a good job for PLAGIARIZING THE SHIT OUT OF MONDAIJI\\n\\n\\n",

No, it's much more than that.\r\nYou follow the story of a brother and sister duo, Sora and Shiro, who are known around the world as the greatest player ever, known as \"_____\" (blank). They receive a message one day from someone unknown, asking if they believe they have been born into the wrong world. Confused, they are then offered to play a game of virtual chess, and while playing, they get sucked into an alternate reality where things are all determined by playing a game.\r\n I love the development of all the characters, andhow everything that they do is explained in the most extravagant way of thinking. The art style will also just keep you hooked, along with the hilarious character interactions. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this show gets a second season, from where it left off, but it is one of my favorites this year. It's not anything like SAO or Log Horizon, but if you like those shows, go for this. Give it a shot, you won't regret it!",

            "content": "[May contain spoilers]\r\n\"If there was world, where simple games decided everything? What would you think about that?\"\r\nI could compare this to 'Sword Art Online' or all the of the other 'game' anime but to be honest this my first 'game' anime. So i'll leave the story for last.\r\nArt ~ would be a '9' for me.\r\nIf I could say one thing about this anime, it has a beautiful art style and a big color palette, kind of like a pastel coloring. I could at the very least say that one of the strong points of the anime is the art direction.\r\nSound ~ is a solid '8'.\r\nIt'snothing special, I didn't really feel the overall sound of the anime affected too much of one scene but it doesn't leave the scene feeling lackluster too. The OP and ED are the ones that stand out, I love the ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~ 's get a '7' for me.\\n\r\nThe characters aren't really on the 'groundbreaking' scale, they're very average and that's how I think they want you to feel. Average people experience extraordinary adventures. Though the 'brother and sister' relationship is pushing their limits, although they mostly do those weird stuff to win theirs games. Although I feel Sora and Shiro can get away with it because I really can feel how close they are to each other. Their names match too, 'White Sky', how lovely.\\n\\n\r\nStory ~ I'm not familiar with this genre of anime but I'll give it a '8'\\n\r\nA story about a game intrigues me as we all enjoy playing a game once in a while. I thought the idea of a world where you end conflicts over games instead of war, death, etc ... was a great idea. That's where the idea of \"Have you ever felt like you we're born on the wrong world?\" we all have felt this once in our lives. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ~ I enjoyed this for my first 'game' anime' so it get's a '8'.\\n\r\nFrom the anime I watch, I enjoy it when they try to challenge your mind. Try to predict might what happen. Though this is shattered by the almighty 'Blank never loses.' It kind of removes the unpredictable outcome but I still have fun on how they achieve their victory.\\n\\n\r\nOverall ~ , it's a '8'.\\n\r\nThe show successfully piques the interest of the concept of a 'game world.' An anime which I enjoyed to the end, made me laugh like a madman in a madhouse. The fights are very creative, games that are original. This anime is bursting with charisma and a pinch of creativity, paired with amazing visuals that could be compared to a framed picture.\\n\\n\r\nI just hope MADHOUSE adapt's a second season, I wanna see them battle their way to the top and beat Tet. I guess the anime achieved what it wanted from me, longing for a conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this I still want more, 12 episodes felt too short for me, I still felt the need for more. I definitely recommend watching this anime if you're interested in a 'game' anime that is captivating and immerse.",

            "content": "No Game No Life is the anime, that can easily become one of the most popular ones out there, if the next seasons deliver. Madhouse always knows what to bring to keep things fresh, don't they?\r\nYou might like this anime if:\r\n-You like anime that focuses on the battle of wits\r\n-You are looking for an original premise\r\n-You are looking for something funny\r\n-You want to watch something in one sitting\r\nYou might dislike this anime if:\r\n-You can't stand unnecessary fanservice\r\n-You didn't watch too many anime\r\n-You can't stand resolutions that seem to come out of nothing\r\n-You'll dislike its humour. It's very specific\r\nStory: 9\r\nYou know that \"inside video game\" trendin anime right? It started after Sword Art Online aired. Why am I bringing that up? Because this is basically a completely new and unique take on that genre. Here, we have a world, that runs on games, not specifically video games, but all types of different ones, like gambling, chess, rock, paper, scissors or even random bets. All of these things can change the world, simply because even a flip of a coin can decide on lives of many or the borders of a country. But what happens when you put the ultimate gamers inside this universe? Well, No Game No Life happens.\\n\r\nThis is one of the most fun settings that has been provided in a long time. It has it's flaws, for example the outcome of each game can be predictable, or some rules and actions seem to come out of nowhere, but other than that, it keeps a steady flow for the entire 12 episodes. It definetely ends on a satisfying note, but nowhere near being complete. There is also a lot of fanservice, but at some points, I almost wanted to clap, because of how neatly it was implemented. The humour is very specific. If it doesn't grab you in the first episode or two, it will most likely not fit yours. There is also a lot of references to other media, video games and anime, so you will enjoy it more if you watched other series. Just a few references are from: Jojo's Bizzare Adventure, Hyouka, Pheonix Wright, Yu-Gi-Oh, Steins;Gate and even Skyrim. Overall, a fantastic setup with a fantastic pace, but some stuff can be obvious or pulled out of thin air.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9\\n\r\nDescribing the art syle of this anime in one word is the easiest thing in the world. Here it goes: Unique. It definetely has one of the most unique colour pallets, everywhere you look it's just dripping from every corner. Throughout the series you can probably spot most of the hues known to men (specifically men, women know way too many colours). At times it felt like too much, but for the most part it was perfectly composed. The animation is also right on par. It can make some really memorable moments shine even brighter, and it only gets better the more you push forward. Overall, this anime is a pleasure to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nHey remember that word that has been around this review a lot? Yeah that one. It fits the soundtrack as well. What was it again? Oh yeah. UNIQUE. Well it's Madhouse so it can't honestly disappoint, but it feels like they took an extra step to make this OST deviate just a bit more. It perfectly fits this fantasy world, with not too many blood pumping themes, but instead more steadily paced ones and ones that almost feel like they have been taken straight from a Bethesda game. Please don't lynch me, but I don't think that the original opening is that great, I only like the covers, thus this is not a ten. But hey, music is subjective after all. Overall, a truly amazing arrangement of perfectly fitting tracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe cast here is pretty great, but I don't feel like any of them really stand out of the crowd of other characters. That is not a bad thing of course, if you can make an already established thing and polish it to perfection, and this anime does that. Mostly. Because you see, there is this one character, that is present mostly to, well, be hot and provide fanservice. I'm looking at you Stephanie Dola. I've seen people defending her, telling people that she means a lot to the MC and so on, but well, that is not my opinion. She does have pretty funny scenes though. But I can't complain about the others, they had their fair share of funny and memorable moments, but that contributes more towards the story aspect. The character development also appears, but not too often. Overall, the cast is great, it's just that other than the scenes they are in, they would more than likely not be too memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nWho cares about anything, this show is so much fun. You can just sit down and marathon it, like I did, or take your time and watch one arc after another. The humour really got to me, the scenes were amazingly directed, even if a bit predictable, and the soundtrack was a pleasure to listen to. This is definetely an anime that touches me in all the right places. It almost feels like a lesser cousin to Code Geass of sorts. Not for even a second was I bored, it kept me entertained the whole way through. This is exactly what I watch anime for: fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis is really one of the most unique anime out there. It may not be right up everyone's alley, but I'm sure that if you will give it a shot, you will not feel betrayed by any means. It is exactly what it seems to be, doesn't deviate too far from it, so if you like what you see, sit down and enjoy the bomb that is No Game No Life. I definetely did.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion and I highly reccomend you to develop your own.",

            "content": "~ Story ~\r\n         No game no life begins with the something that is very common in anime, namely being dissatisfied with this world, and for some sort of reason being transported to another world. You might wonder why I give it a 8 when it already has been done many times before. The reason for this is that the concept is actually quite fun, a brother and a sister NEETs are the best in any games they play and see the normal world as a bad game, then at some point they are magically transported to anotherworld where everything is solved by games. Not very original as I've heard the story somewhere before in an anime which I can't even remember so unimpressive it was (and for some reason people turned into cats when they got hit???). The reason why I like this storyline so much is because of them actually never wanting to go back, this together with the some great storytelling makes it quite entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n~ Art ~\\n\r\n         This anime has a very strong animation, it is very colorfull with a lot of pink or beige colors, maybe sometimes even too much. For some people this might be a pluspunt, for me myself I'd rather see it a bit less colorfull as it kind of distracts me from the main point, but overall the animation of this anime is one of the better points.\\n\\n\r\n~ Sound ~\\n\r\n          I can't remember any songs or sounds from the anime after watching it so naturally it get's a low score in this one. I do have to say that I might be slightly biased in this since I have a very specific taste in music when it comes to songs and all other songs I just totally forget. The songs are very similar to other animes.\\n\\n\r\n~ Character ~\\n\r\n          Even though the characters have an annoying brother sister complex where they can't be apart too far, the characters are still the best part about the anime and I especially like how they take advantage of the rules to the point where they are actually abusing them, and have no ethical uneasy by doing it. They both seem a bit whimsical at times, but their devilish side is what makes them so great.\\n\\n\r\n~ Overall ~\\n\r\n          , I would recommend it for sure. It is ecchi like I said and it is set in a gaming world, but it's different than others I've seen which is refreshing. I loved it. It's smart, action packed, funny and definitely rewatchable.",

            "content": "After watching Death Note and Code Geass, I was sure that I wouldn't find another anime as good as them. (Spoilers)\r\nSo this anime begins pretty normally with a brother sister NEET relationship conquering every game imaginable. The idea that they are geniuses is somewhat hinted in the beginning, but you get to see their true colors as the series goes on. The siblings get recognized for being the best and being called cheaters in an online MMO by a God from another world. This God plays a game of Chess with them and immediately teleports them to another world. This world is governed by gamesand games alone. Everything from increasing your race's territory to owning someone's life involves playing a game. This series goes on to show how the two MC siblings, Sora and Shiro, delve into this new world and strive to conquer it as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is somewhat different, but very appeasing to the eyes. The scenery is outstanding and the characters are designed very well. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime matched the atmosphere of whatever was going on in the show. It added depth and a great sense of emotion into the scenes. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were few, but of great quality. We have the two MC siblings, Sora and Shiro, who are both geniuses at video games. Sora seems confident, outgoing, and sort of goofy while Shiro is somewhat reserved, cute, and collected. We also have Stephanie who is a goofy, clumsy ex-princess of the kingdom that Sora and Shiro try to help. Her character definitely relieves tension in the anime and is always nice to have around. All of the characters have their own colors and contribute something great to the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show was amazing. It's one of those shows where you watch an episode and wish it was longer, but then go ahead to watch the next one and repeat the process until you kill it in one night. It's a great \"smart\" anime (for lack of a better term) that mixes comedy in with very likeable characters.",

A story about Sora and Shiro who never ventured outside and played any kind of games including video, card and board games. From their great talents they were dragged into a world where everything is settle by games. \r\nFirst off, I love this idea because being a heavy gamer of all types myself, chess, checkers, poker of all kinds, two-up, and many video games (as to be expected). The idea that wars and nations could settle such things threw these mediums is entertaining.\r\nSecond section here talks about the animation itself. Very smoothing and rich animationand with the colours using throughout separated from other animations I have seen to date. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice action in the English dub was great and what i expected the characters to sound like in my mind. The sound track for this anime was also great with the opening theme and ending theme being enjoyable to listen to. In fact it is one of the few anime's I would watch all the way through because of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe story line was stated before hand and repeating myself, I liked the idea and the direction it went, too bad it was only one season worth for the moment but i am excited for the next one to be released.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I Really enjoyed this anime and would recommend it to my friends. Loved the animation and the soundtrack. The English dub was great.\\n\\n\r\nRapid Reviews gives a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDatrium Rapid Radium",

            "content": "This is one of those animes that you dont found very often. Even for someone like me who has seen hundreds upon hundres of different anime series, I dont remember the last time I was so excited week after week. It is based on the original light novel series, which are amazing too and very worth reading. I will be rating it part by part below, so you get a better idea.\r\nLets start with the story - 10\r\nThe concept behind the story is simple but at the same time is just plain awesome. For all those who like games (of any kind) and think youare good at them and want to show off your skills, this Disboard is for you. It's a world where everything is decided by games, and you can bet absolutely anything, even world domination. This is where our two main characters come in.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an urban legend about a group players known as \"Blank\" (\"K\u016bhaku\" in japanese) who are known for being unbeatable and have even won battles of 1000 vs 4. In reality they are a pair of hikikomori (shut-in) siblings who control 4 accounts at the same time!! The older brother \"Sora\" and the little sister \"Shiro\". They pass their days playing games in their room and avoiding the exterior as much as possible, but one day for one reason or another they found themselfes in this strange fantasy world where their talent can finally shine at its brightest, and there they decided to use that talent to take over the world and even the one and only God Tet. But that's enough story for now.\\n\\n\r\nNow the art and sound - 10\\n\r\nI cant even start to describe how beautiful this anime is. The art here really brings out the best of the fantasy world with an immense amount of colors and awesome animation. Its the first anime I have ever seen to use a RED outline, instead of the typical black one. The character designs are vivid and memorable, and as for the soundtrack, Im listening at it as Im writing this. Both the opening and ending are incredible in their own way, but my favorite has to be the heartbreaking yet heartwarming ending, literally made me cry. \\n\\n\r\nNext are the characters - 10\\n\\n\r\nThere is not even a single character that I didnt like. Not only their designs are amazing, but their personalities are memorable, likable, and in many cases pretty badass (but that last part is mostly for the main characters).\\n\r\nLets go over some of the most important characters.\\n\\n\r\nSora - An 18 year old brilliant NEET and the older brother of hikikomori siblings, and pretty much the character all the story is explained through. While not as intelligent as his younger sister who can calculate numbers as a super computer, he still shows an incredible IQ in his abiliries of predicting his opponents movements based on their behavior, motivations, background, etc. His ability to read the mind of his opponent and plan ahead of any situation is truly remarkable. He may be a little perverted at times, but he never goes to far, and as much as he wants a girlfriend, his little sister Shiro wont allow it.\\n\\n\r\nShiro - An 11 year old genius girl who loves her older brother Sora more than anything in the world. Both her and her brother have this dependece on each other that makes them inseparable as they cover each others weaknesses, making them truly the perfect team. She is a genius when it comes to logic and mathematical problems, but has a little more difficulty understanding emotions or the behaviourof his opponents, which is where her older brother Sora helps her. As smart as she is, she needs Sora to do pretty much anything (that also goes for Sora), and she becomes pretty jelous when Sora gets the attention of other girls, which just shows how much she loves him and means to her. She is also voiced by Kayano Ai, who also did the voice for another adorable silver-headed girl, Menma from Ano Hana, and also Roman from SKET Dance.\\n\r\n[She was my favorite character by far]\\n\\n\r\nStephanie, Dora / Steph - She is a cute but gullible 18 year old girl who expresses her feelings very clearly most of the time by her expressions, dialog, and actions. She is the character where most of the fanservice is shown through and its mostly a comic relief, but in a way its also the most relatable character in the sense that unlike all the other characters, she in a \"normal\" human/imanity and expresses the surprise and astonishment most people experience while watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nJibril - Jibril is the youngest and strongest of the Fl\u00fcgelrace and has a intense desire for knowledge. That's pretty much all I can say without spoilers, but belive me, she is awesome!\\n\\n\r\nNow lets move to my overall rating - 10\\n\r\nIt is an awesome anime with a simple yet intresting story, likable and memorable characters, astonishing visuals and music, and great animation all around.\\n\\n\r\nIt has all the things I look in an anime:\\n\r\n-An intresting first episode that hooks you\\n\r\n-A good story that keeps you hooked\\n\r\n-A beautiful world that lets your mind wander\\n\r\n-Characters that you just instantly bond with\\n\r\n-Good music and visuals\\n\r\n-And a satisfactory ending for the season\\n\\n\r\nI think this is the kind of anime that anyone who is mature enough to get over the occasional fanservice or any other \"wierd/2Japanese4Me\" factor, but any normal anime lover/otaku would absolutely enjoy this series. So if you can get over this, I defenitly recommend it to you, because it is truly what I consider a Masterpiece.",

In the beginning it seemed like it was going to be something along the lines of .Hack or Sword Art Online, where they like video games and end up being inside whether in a good or bad way. But it took a huge turn, in a sense of making NEETs become heroes in their own environment. \r\nThe story itself is amazing; well plot out and turns where they need to be, leaving you on the edge of anticipation as well as keeping you brain reeling for answers. But there is also aglorious balance of character development that is clean and easy to keep up with as well as a very well planned balance of humor and seriousness that is tasteful. \\n\r\nWhat really kept me in awe was the art; vibrate, colorful ad beautiful. It really gave a taste of the world they had been given. It was also just nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it for all anime lovers as well as just someone looking for a good story. And if you don't leave from it laughing or on the edge of your seat; you're watching it wrong.",

            "content": "Before I start, I have to say that this review may be a bit biased due to my love for \"No Game No Life\"(from here on i'll say NGNL for short).\r\nPeople say that NGNL's story is a copy of \"Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\"(Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They?), but I say if it has been done about 10 times better than the original, it doesn't matter if it has a similar plot line.\r\nTo me, NGNL is a work of genius. The story, yet slightly unoriginal, is amazing. It makes our world and it's laws and wars look utterlyidiotic as the people of NGNL can decide everything with games without pain, suffering, death or destruction. Sounds like fun right? This also means that it is generally the most tactical and knowledgeable people that have the power to obtain what they desire in their life.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in NGNL is amazing. It's flashy and fun and matches the tone of the anime almost perfectly. The landscape is especially nice with it's seemingly random and gravity defying scenery that gives the anime a fun yet alien feel.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, one of the highlights of the anime is it's sound. The soundtrack is bouncy and fun, sounding like it should come from a video game, matching the gaming style of the anime. The best part of the sound is the opening: \"this game\" by Konomi Suzuki. An absolutely beautiful song that I just can't hear enough of.\\n\\n\r\nIm not sure if the characters in NGNL can be considered \"original\" but I don't think that really matters too much. All that matters is how they fit in with the story. You've got Sora, the cocky, perverted mastermind who is never short on cunning schemes and ways to win games and annoy Steph. There's also Shiro, the loli sister of Sora who is stupidly smart and adorable. She can learn languages in hours, calculate trajectories for bullets in milliseconds and can't be out of the line of sight of Sora without both of them having major panic attacks. There's also Stephanie Dola who is the comic relief character in NGNL. She is always the target from one of Sora's pranks and goes through all sorts of trouble from the siblings. Then there's Jibril who is a bloodthirsty, knowledgethirsty and almost psychopathic Flugel which is a made up race from NGNL. They are angel-like beings who can use very powerful magic and adore books.\\n\\n\r\nThis was probably the most enjoyable anime I've ever watched. Its got games, magic, alternate universes, kemonomimis, strategies, witty puns and Sora.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this anime to anyone who loves non generic shounen protagonists with actual brains or anyone who loves anime in general. It is a must watch anime that should be enjoyed by everyone.",

The outcomes were always so unpredictable and even if the 2 siblings kept repeating \"Blank never loses\", there are times where I got nervous for them. I definitely enjoyed the whole serie. The plot idea was new and really entertaining. I liked the humour they threw in as well as all the plot twists and the development of the story. My only regret is that it was too short, so I hope new seasons will follow soon.\r\nThe art is really colorful.It fits well with the theme of games and the drawings were quite nice. Shiro is a cutie pie. All the games they played had some extraordinary features and I liked the effects and animation they used. The game of shiritori is a great example. The way they made things appear of disappear as well as the characters' reaction to each other's answers made that really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is fine. I liked the opening theme. But I have to be honest, as I was watching, I skipped the opening and ending themes most of the time because I just wanted to see what happens next in the story.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the characters. Sora and Shiro were the perfect combination to be the unbeatable gamer unit [Blank]. Their personality complement each other and their sibling relationship and complete trust in each other is admirable and adorable to watch. Steph is seen more as a comic relief most of the time and the other characters each have their own wise tricks and made the games interesting. I could never guess what would happen next and seeing [Blank] battle against other smart opponents made the challenges worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I loved this anime very much. I hope there will be more in the near future. This serie has completely won me over.",

I actively seek these types of anime out; death note, one outs, kaiji, liar game, usogui, even code geass to an extent. No Game No Life is not an intelligence based anime. If you are looking for anything similar to what is listed above then do not watch this anime.\r\nIn fact, if you're not looking for a heavily fan-serviced based, often illogical anime you should not watch this anime.\r\nIf you want to enjoy this anime, you should view the \"intelligence\" of the main characters as a super power. In the same way spidermancan shoot webs, the main characters can perfectly predict every action that every other character in the show makes with little to no knowledge of their personality or general abilities (and no logical thought process). \\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\r\nThe story gets most of its points for an enjoyable premise. The idea of a \"world of games\" is pretty original, or at least hasn't often been portrayed successfully within anime (or literature). The world is generally a pretty well thought out one, and the situations that they are put into are interesting enough.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the things they do/say are pretty dumb. I'm also confused as to why the \"challenged\" team can't just create a game that makes them a 99.99% favourite (stakes are decided beforehand, and they're clearly allowed to make a game that favours them).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\r\nSo.... the main characters are smart? I doubt there was really much more thought put into characters besides that. There was no development in any of the characters, they are all identical to how they are when they're introduced. If they are identical to the start, what was the point of the 12 episodes?\\n\\n\r\nStill the characters have some amusing traits. If you watch the first episode and fine them funny then you'll probably enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nExecution (art,sound,dialog etc.) 7/10\\n\r\nProduction quality/budget is high, so art/sound are generally pretty good. Fan service is drawn well I guess, the incest lolicon fan service is kinda weird. \\n\\n\r\nDialog is okay. Sometimes they say some incredibly cliched or stupid things but in general it's pretty typical dialog you come to expect from anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nI didn't like it much, but it was entertaining enough for me to watch the entire thing. Don't look for anything of substance, it's more of a show you want to watch",

            "content": "With every year comes a new anime that receives ridiculous amounts of hype. 2012 had Sword Art Online, 2013 had Attack on Titan, and now in 2014 we have No Game No Life.\r\nSo what are my thoughts on it? I'll keep it short so that I can go into individual categories: NGNL, in terms of story, is downright AMAZING, but after a little bit of reflection, there are some things it could definitely do better.\r\nStory: The story focuses around Sora and Shiro, a pair of NEET(Not in Employment, Education, or Training), shut-in siblings that are transported to a fantasy world where everything, even who rulesor first love, is decided by games. Over the course of the 12 episodes, Sora and Shiro participate in games in order to save Imanity(the humans of Disboard) from being completely overtaken by the 15 other races.\\n\\n\r\nI am a HUGE fan of anime series that use settings that revolve around games. The entire premise of using games to decide everything is unique and totally original. To put it simply, every game played is an absolute joy to watch, both from intensity and from character reactions.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing that caught me off guard though: there's A LOT of ecchi fan service in here. Just giving a fair warning for those that are bothered by it. Personally, I don't mind it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The fantasy world of Disboard (Disboard...\"this board\"? XD) simply looks amazing and the characters are very unique in design. The Fl\u00fcgel(a god slaying race that has some angel characteristics) were easily my favorite of the few races shown in the 1st Season. Just like most anime series in the past few years, the art is easily one of the strongest parts.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This anime's soundtrack is extremely catchy. Much like Crossing Field and Guren no Yumiya, the opening theme, This Game, will likely remain stuck in your head for the next few weeks...or months.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the soundtrack seems a little limited, as I've heard The King's Plan and a few other tracks used all too often. While the OST is excellent, expect to hear the same tracks often throughout every episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voices, I only have one piece of advice: only watch the English subs!! The dub is quite bad, not only in quality but in voice selection, as some voices sound older than the character in question (like Shiro), or just don't sound like they'd match the design of the character (like Jibril).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(I'm only covering a few to keep it short): I loved the main protagonists: Sora and Shiro. They were charismatic, had fitting personalities, and were hilarious on multiple occasions. However, their backgrounds as NEETs and shut-ins isn't that interesting and I did find their intelligence to be a little too unbelievable. They were borderline omniscient!\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that really bothered me about these characters is that they are prime examples of \"hikikomori otakus\". I know it's harmless(since it's an anime), but the anime made it look like that kind of lifestyle was OK to have. Trust me, it isn't(haven't experienced it, but I have good knowledge from secondary sources).\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters were equally as good. I found Stephanie Dola to be a pretty interesting character with her background as the granddaughter of Imanity's previous king, and Jibril was cute, funny, and eccentric.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was hooked from beginning to end. 'Nuff said.\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nExtra Things:\\n\r\nShiro, the 11-year-old protagonist, has some ecchi fan service, so some people may be bothered by it. I myself found it unnecessary, and I didn't like it as well.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really like that it ended on a cliffhanger...it needs a 2nd Season.\\n\\n\r\nExtra Points:\\n\r\nFor being an ecchi anime that actually has a really good plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters look great. I'd easily consider the Fl\u00fcgel to be the best in design.\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9.40/10. A definite must watch. Incredibly addictive, but needs a 2nd Season for a satisfying finish.",

Upon discovering the protagonists' goals, you are sucked right into the series as the development of the story as well as the characters leave you attached. The dialog in this anime is everything but terrible and the art is fantastic which really gives you something to look forward to even if you still think the synopsis is a bit sketchy (like what i initially thought).\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters. Unlike many anime where the protagonist have some overwhelming edge, NGNL gives you characters that as hard as it is to imagine, are basically just humans. They strive through their trials with the only thing humans have that other animals in real life lacked, higher level cognitive functions. All through the first season, this character restriction that the protagonists have stays consistent from the very first episode, up until the very last and if theres anything that should be appreciated in anime, it has to be consistency.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that when you have positive points of all aspects of an anime, it ends up being astonishing. Well let me say that NGNL is just that, and if there is only one anime you could pick up from spring 2014, I highly recommend NGNL because even having to leave my comfort zone for anime, there was not a single thing I could really criticize about NGNL that would make me drop it.",

BUT, if you enjoy letting his OPness flow through your veins as you watch this fast-paced anime, then you'll enjoy the hell out of No Game No Life.\r\nThe story is one of the strong points of NGNL. If I had to compare it to anything, I'd say NGNL is like the love-child of Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? and Death Note. A weird combo, I know, but I think it playsout beautifully. There's a complex and almost psychological element to each game Sora plays, but everything is watered down and made bright and fun by classic anime cliches and humor. Some may be offended I even dared to compare NGNL to Death Note, but the way in which the MCs execute plans with hidden components and steps thought out so far ahead it makes your head spin are too similar to deny. On the other hand, I'm sure everyone agrees the concept is very to MGIKKSDY... bored OP characters entering a new world, \"dangerous\" anime girls being made fun of, crazy fan-service, it's all the same, except NGNL actually makes you think.\\n\\n\r\nThe art fits great with the plot. Nice and eye-catching. If anything, it's a clear indicator to how the creators intended to sell NGNL: as the crowd pleaser of all crowd pleasers. I honestly didn't pay much attention to the music, but I'm pretty certain it all set up a good ambiance for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with NGNL is with characters. Sora is little more than the crowd pleaser he was made to be. He's stereotypically egotistical, invariably intelligent and yet impossibly immature. The female characters are a joke. It's actually a bit similar to SAO where supposedly serious and hardcore girls turn into puddles at the feet of the great MALE MC, who teases then into useless tsunderes. It's actually kind of sad, but this is more of a criticism of anime as a whole, not of NGNL in particular, which merely capitalizes upon it. After years of watching shit like this, I'm almost immune, but I know it'll bother a lot of people. Just don't expect any character development; most of them exist solely to advance the plot or make cheap jokes.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, I still loved the show. I guess some of the cliches of anime are cliches for a reason; people love them. They didn't take away from the anime anymore than they did for well-loved animes like SAO. I hope this gets more recognition and I would recommend this for newcomers, those who are in anime slumps, and experienced anime watchers trying to pull themselves together after depressing/intense/horrific animes. NGNL is a solid 12 episodes of enjoyment, and has actually made my top 10. (Don't let all the patronizing reviewers riding their high horses prevent you from giving it a try).",

It engaged my attention and drove me to think about what I was watching every episode, and that counts for something.

It doesn't jump between too many different points of views, and keeps a steady exciting pace throughout the series, that keeps you wanting more at the end of each episode. There was never a dull moment for me, and I found my self laughing a lot more than I anticipated. You won't find a dull moment in this anime, even if you try.\r\nThe art is beautiful and I often found myself marveling some of theincredible scenery. The amount of colors used is immaculate, and serves as great eye candy. \\n\\n\r\nThe music played in here is fantastic as well. You know they feeling of excitement you get when you know something awesome is going to happen, and the music kicks in? No game no life does it flawlessly.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is spot on too, although I generally find most japanese dubbed anime to be pretty great vs english dubbed. The opening and ending were also enjoyable, and I often times found myself watching the opening (which I don't do often)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great! Although the character may seem incredibly smart, and invincible, not to mention is genius little sister, he also has weaknesses. Which are exposed throughout.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, well that's an understatement. I have seen plenty of anime in my time, and I can say I haven't had this much fun watching an anime in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime deserves a 10/10 and You will definitely get pulled in from the start. I'll throw in a money back guarantee with that statement.",

            "content": "No Game No Life\r\nWhen I saw the first couple minutes of No Game No Life my first reaction was one of annoyance. Sword Art Online and Log Horizon now this?! I was just kind of tired of this reoccurring video game setting in anime. After viewing the first episode I realized that it wasn\u2019t actually about video games, but in general games. Now as soon as I completed the first episode of this series I told my friend Jordan that the first episode was very entertaining. He acknowledged the series existence and told me he had already seen the first episode, he then proceeded torecommend me to \u201cMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\u201d. Now anyone who claims that this show is better than No Game No Life is in the wrong in my opinion. Not only is the rating difference a huge way to tell the difference between these two shows but this is like preferring Guilty Crown to Code Geass. Now I made a mediocre review of Problem Children so if you want to see my opinions on that series go check it out. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nThe setting of No Game No Life is slightly original; Problem Children did do it first. But series have done this concept before that as well. Also I\u2019m not so sure the Writer of NGNL\u2019s light novel copied the author of Problem Children\u2019s light novel. So two reclusive hikikomori siblings who are extremely intelligent put that intelligence to use in games, which they happen to be very good at. These two siblings are brought to another world where everything is decided by games. You want my money? Well then play me in a game. You want my property? Well then play me in a game. This world they are brought to there are pledges in which the inhabitants of Disboard must follow. The first three pledges are, all murder, war, and robbery is forbidden in this world, all conflict in this world will be resolved through games, and in games each player will bet something that they agree is of equal value (I paraphrased this so there might be some mistakes). This concept alone had me interested, because its world where literally everything is decided by games. The problem with the whole plot is that its highly predictable, the main characters never lose and since they literally never lose some of the games just aren\u2019t so exciting. I\u2019ve come to realize this show isn\u2019t about the main characters winning because we already know they will win, but instead about how are MCS achieve that win, and how they outsmart their opponents.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nI guess Madhouse decided to copy the vibrant color scheme of Shaft because the art feels like a shaft Anime other than the animation itself. I\u2019ve never been a fan of the abstract color scheme style of creating an anime because it usually gives me headaches. The character designs for all characters are ok none of them really stood out for me. I\u2019m not sure whether to put this under Art or Story but this fucking anime has way too much fan service for an intellectual show. If you\u2019re trying to make something with well thought out action sequences like No Game No Life every other scene doesn\u2019t need to be a goddamn panty shot and I don\u2019t need to see the characters bathing. \\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 7\\n\r\nKirito from SAO is the main characters voice actor if you haven\u2019t already noticed. He does well as Shiro from NGNL and none of the characters suffer from a miscast in the voicing department. The OST is really forgettable; I don\u2019t even remember the opening song. The SFX used during action sequences sound cool for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 6\\n\r\nUgh, how the **** is blank so perfect? They are goddamn hikkimori shut-ins but in reality they are extremely charismatic and intellectual individuals rivaling that of Einstein. Sora is Gary Stu and Shiro is a Mary Stu. Also Shiro is completely unlikable as an MC, she has literally no fucking emotions, and she is a robot for fucks sake, she\u2019s a goddamn robot who wins games and screams Oni-chan every five seconds. Stephaine only really serves the point of explaining things they don\u2019t know about the world Disboard, like the history. There aren\u2019t any characters other then the main ones really, and which ever character he beats WHICH ARE ONLY FUCKING GIRLS SO FAR join his harem.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 8\\n\r\nIt\u2019s all about the action scenes with this show, pretty much everything else will bore you. The fan service did annoy me quite a bit so it sapped away my enjoyment from the show, specifically because people were behind me the whole time while I watched this and they were like \u201cAre you watching Hentai?\u201d. I definitely would mind a season two if the show has more well thought out action scenes like the first but if you take that away from the show really nothing is left.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 7\\n\r\nI really can\u2019t give it a rating any higher, it\u2019s good. But worth rank 21 on MAL, definitely not. I feel that the top 100 should be reserved for the best of the best, something which is an utter masterpiece or at least something that people agree is good. This isn\u2019t a masterpiece no matter how you view it, even if your enjoyment level of this series was a 10, you must admit it was lacking in other departments that drag it down.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nI liked this series. Would I give it higher than a 7? No. It\u2019s 12 episodes and not enough really happens to make me absolutely fall in love with this series. If there is a season two will I watch and possibly reconsider? I will not reconsider my rating for the first season, but season two could be a 10. Should you watch this series? Yes, it\u2019s very enjoyable at times. Should you watch this series in a family friendly environment? No it\u2019s super ecchi and shows way too much fan service. What is the best part of this series? The well thought out, and well written action scenes. Why do some people gives this a 3? These people are both ignorant and stubborn, and have probably seen a rather generic boring anime like Problem Children.\\n\\n\r\nSay\u014dnara, my fellow anime viewers. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Story\r\nHonestly, how many times have we seen this before. Shut in characters that are critical of the world and how it works which makes them want to escape it. In the midst of ignoring everything they hate, they are offered some sort of opportunity to do what they want and only what they want, no matter how out of place in society those things are. NGNL\u2019s premise is, admittedly, extremely cliche. However, that doesn\u2019t stop it from bringing new and fresh things to the table. Its plot line is unique in the way that the characters aren\u2019t trying to escape the world that they livein for a while in order to grow, but instead they are ready and willing to completely abandon it, writing it off as just a \u201cpoorly designed game.\u201d NGNL has a 100% focus on that new world making it seem more like fantasy than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many entertaining arcs and the entire anime focuses solely on the main characters\u2019 rise to new found power. NGNL sets the stage for a monumental conquest and takes the phrase \u201cthe world is your oyster\u201d to a whole new level, but at the same time, the anime feels like just that\u2026 just a set up. During the course of NGNL\u2019s 12 episodes, it seems like our heroes are taking many large steps in their journey, but their journey has only just begun by the end of the last episode. Season 1\u2019s bounds and leaps were all amazing but by the end you are reminded that you\u2019ve really seen nothing. As such, it is hard to give NGNL anything higher than an 8 in story as it is simply no where near complete. Know that the elements that are introduced that will eventually lead up to the grand finale in the light novels or the anime if it keeps getting funded, are incredibly spectacular and I can only imagine destined greatness for the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI had incredibly mixed feelings about the characters in NGNL. At times I really loved the way they worked. They are clearly defined and have moments of incomparable badassery. They each work well on their own and have their own sets of motivations and goals, minus of course Sora and Shiro, our brother-sister protags, who cannot be separated.\\n\\n\r\nSora was an amazing lead. He was an extremely tactful, confident, and witty character. His character was quite simply designed to play games of any nature and he exceeds particularly at mind games and the unconventional. Many times I was surprised by just how unexpected and contrived some of his plans would end up. More often than not it was interesting and engaging as he often analyzed the behaviors of the opponents. At the same time there were many moments where I was in major disbelief as to how he could\u2019ve known some of the things he did. Other times I praised him for risky moves that were no more than bluffs based on assumptions.\\n\\n\r\nShiro was the other half of the equation. Sora\u2019s younger sister and partner in crime, Shiro was in charge of the cold hard math. Her calculating nature didn\u2019t allow much for anomalies and she was easily flustered when her calculations were off due to something she didn\u2019t foresee, but after that she would leave the fight up to Sora. Unfortunately, she almost felt like more of a supporting character, continuously tagging along with Sora rather than having them rely completely on each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe praise ends with the protags. The other characters, although they had their motives for winning games, felt mostly like stepping stones to advance the plot. All they were were opponents in the end and even the ones that stick around didn\u2019t get much development. Stephanie Dola who should\u2019ve been a much more serious and important character given her status was the butt of every joke and an oppai fanservice machine. Admittedly I got a few chuckles from the slapstick at times, but man her character could\u2019ve been so much more awesome than just a ditz. Then there\u2019s Jibril who I guess we just didn\u2019t learn much about. She had a more guarded feel to her character. Jibril had at least an extra layer, like she has some sort of hidden agenda as opposed to Steph\u2019s \u201coh i\u2019m just along for the ride\u201d feeling. All in all those characters were underdeveloped and out of focus. Watch NGNL for the plot line if anything.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nNGNL was beautiful at times, but overdone at others. Lighting in general was what either made or broke a scene. The style was done in a high contrast and extremely high bloom. I often felt like a lot of the detail was lost in the way the light would consume parts of the scene. The character designs were appealing to the eye and the world was incredibly unique. My only problem was the lighting for the most part, but it honestly was a big problem.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNGNL had a pretty memorable OST. I was instantly hooked on the OP and the music throughout was very fitting of the scenes, whether it be ridiculous antics or the incredible action sequences. There were also a few interesting sound effects that I now associate the anime with. Ear catches like the acceptance of a battle, and effects such as the guns in the last arc had an amazing impact and were very fresh. NGNL really took sound seriously, I\u2019m sure most would agree.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI don\u2019t usually include comments for my personal enjoyment rating, nor do I ever factor it into my actual average, but I feel like there are things worth mentioning about NGNL, because even though this rating is going to come out fairly low, I had way more fun with this anime than my rating is going to show. The biggest thing worth mentioning is the comedy. NGNL was at it\u2019s core one big game. Nothing was ever taken too seriously and it allowed for tons of jokes and references that many anime fans and gamers would die laughing at due to their unexpected nature and expert delivery. I feel like Sora and Shiro are also relatable character for those who are serious about the culture that this anime embraces. So I would most certainly NOT count this anime out if all you want is a hearty gamer laugh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nYou guys maybe surprised that I\u2019m rounding down, but it honestly has to be done. Objectively, NGNL is good, but quite simply doesn\u2019t work in its current form. I personally enjoyed the ride, but most of the awesome came from my personal tastes which I understand most people wouldn\u2019t share. It\u2019s also hard to over look NGNL\u2019s flaws and its far from finished feeling. I don\u2019t mean for this review to discourage anyone who thinks it seems interesting, but I would mostly recommend this as a \u201cWatch Later\u201d or \u201cWatch, Then Read.\u201d To recommend NGNL as a standalone would be a pretty awful recommendation.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "I typed this whole review on a phone, so here it goes.\r\nEpic, is the first thing of when I finished this anime. Goosebumps, is what I had after each episode and awe, is what I felt the whole time watching this. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story has never been off track the whole time, keeping me on my chair, wanting to watch more of this anime. Certain episodes will mindfuck you, giving this series a 'mysterious' feel. Like other anime, the protagonist (or in this case, protagonists) are the 'chosen one' , but ranging in different personalities. Of course, this series pulled it off successfully, without breakinga sweat. Each episode made me giggle or even laugh because of how comedic it can be, even when the scene is serious. I'm glad I found this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first saw a cover for the anime, I was in a breathtaking state, looking at the art with very vibrant colours. Of course, I wasn't disappointed either when I saw an episode. Very smooth animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP has that feel where it starts at a small scale, maybe at a person or a couple and after maybe a couple of seconds, goes into a big scale, at the size of a planet. I might be delusional, so if that didn't make sense then I'm fine with that. The OP fitted nicely with the theme of the anime, being heroic and all.  The ED has that feel where it's meant to be an ED and not anything else. The soundtracks playing in the background fits the scene, whether it be a comedic or a serious scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEach character did a nice job on its role:\\n\\n\r\nSora, being the genius he is, yet a pervert. I don't like pervert main characters, but he is an exception.\\n\\n\r\nShiyo, a cute 11 year old sister of Sora, who loves him a lot (possibly even in a man-woman relationship) and will do anything to be with him.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of them are what makes up 'Blank'. A duo that will never leave each other and will freak out if they are not in the radius.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyed this anime to the very last, even hoping for a season 2, as it ended in a cliffhanger.\\n\r\nWould I re-watch it in the future? Oh hell yeah.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\r\nI still wouldn't give it a 10 because it ended too soon. If you're looking for a short, one that would make you laugh but yet give you goosebumps, then this anime is for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nfak my wrists hurt from typing on a touchscreen \\n",

            "content": "Being set in an alternate magical world you would expect magic spells and dragons and such, but this show takes on a different path. The plot is quite simple and enjoyable, and the art/color is pretty darn captivating. The dialogue and lines are well thought out and character personalities have a surprising depth to them. The music includes one of the most fun, playful tracks I've seen in a while. If I had to mention something good about this show it would be deep personality reflected in the voice acting, its one thing to have someone have a good tone when talking, but these actorsreally bring the character's personalities to life in an amazing way. If I had to mention something bad about this show it would be that it can feel a bit too childish at times; the seinen tag is pretty strong in this one if that's something you don't like. I'd like to see the story finished to really critique this well. Favorite characters: Shiro/Jibril. I give it a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTLDR Version: Flawless, but lets wait for the ending. Extraordinary in several areas. Childish.",

            "content": "Note: After reading my first review of the series, I decided that my opinion piece was overly antagonistic, and having grown up, it seems that there is far too much hate over trivial things, as well as the presence of politics in the previous review that seemed utterly inappropriate, and that I regret and apologize for.\r\nThat being said, the show is still incredibly dreadful upon my second viewing. \r\nIn terms of the plot, two exceptionally talented siblings who happen to be a loser hikikomori, are pulled into another fantasy world after demonstrating to the God Tet their amazing skills at online chess, withSora proclaiming that he and his little sister Shirou will take over the world to challenge Tet, which amazingly happens to include the only thing we have seen the duo excel at, GAMES, which they all effortlessly beat over the course of 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I feel the term \"wish fulfillment\" and \"pandering\" are used interchangeably, despite most anime usually being a targeted approach to a certain exploitable market of otakus, and thus qualify as \"pandering\", I can honestly say that the elements of wish fulfillment are apparent, and drag the anime down.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the first time most people have seen less than ideal characters as protagonists if but to relate to the audience and to juxtapose their more win-win moments. However, Sora and Shiro, by virtue of being unproductive losers only good at one thing, make it a template with which to base dynamic character growth, but they stay the same throughout the series, with Shiro having little to no character beyond the stoic child trope that has been all the rage (Part of the larger Kuudere character archetype) and Sora is incredibly cocky, but apparently has a heart of gold. \\n\\n\r\nThis is peculiar enough as Sora and Shiro are back on Earth, what I consider losers in every sense of the word. My teacher once said \"Intelligence is as Intelligence does\", meaning that any semblance of thinking is only recognized by its contributions and products, not the mere existence of. That is why many people know who Albert Einstein is, versus that of William Sidis, who was arguably troubled enough to not apply it as Einstein did.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, they are flawed characters who do not grow, but are merely placed in a world that their major flaws simply don't matter. Looking back at my own adolescence, it seems to tie into the mentality many teenagers have of a grander sense of intelligence than which they likely possessed, and the entitlement one demands acknowledging such, and biting the hand of the world that housed you when no one cares enough to pat one on the back. Sora rejects the world that rejects him, but while the world is a cruel and unfair place, this doesn't make him any more logical than the anime portrays him, but far less so. Intelligence isn't a substitute for maturity, and Sora clearly has problems with Earthen society that it would fairly hard to NOT blame it on him in the end. It caters to the angst mentality that one normally associates with the onset of puberty, but instead of making any profound or even sensible insight as to how to cope, this anime only offers succor beyond sympathy and consolation, but by seemingly reaffirming such childish beliefs, which is perhaps the most insidious nature of Stus. It of course, depends on what you define as \"perfection\".\\n\\n\r\nSora and Shiro are the most developed  of the cast, but I don't find them interesting. Shiro is probably the most disconcerting of the cast to me, as her reticent nature makes her more calculator than person, save for one episode where she went solo. I often read that Sora reads the player, and Shiro does the number crunching, and this is true enough. However, I find most people can't do the emotionless archetype right, and due to the compounding factors revolving around a lack of dynamism, Shiro doesn't feel like a character but more of a plot device. Characters change, have a notable personality, a set of beliefs. Being cute and not talkative hardly qualifies, especially when such a character type is popular enough that Final Fantasy's Lightning makes the top waifu list. (Seriously?)\\n\\n\r\nShiro is depicted as being somewhat as intelligent as Shiro, albeit with reading people and such. He comes off as bit of an asshole, some entitlement there, some arrogance there. He almost always has a smug expression on his face, which is to be expected, but after 12 episodes of such, I simply got tired of his never letting lack of self doubt. He isn't as villainous as Tatsuya Shiba, or as much of a jerk as Eren Yeager. I found him boring. Having just one expressions isn't any different than having none.\\n\\n\r\nTo tie this up, the relationship was oddly a great deal less incestuous than it initially appears, but the lack of any sort of family dynamic is the greatest downfall. We see flashes of their past, but they just served to be more cryptic and doesn't quite explain anything about their current relationship, which is more defined as needing to be within eyesight and within close range before they turn into the hikikomori selves. This sounds interesting, but the weakness is not exploited except for comedy.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else is conveniently a female, whether they be opposition or allies, save for a few. To be fair, this is expected, and not a death dirge in itself. However, the cast is barely developed beyond an attempt to selling Dakimakuras. \\n\\n\r\nStephanie \"Stephanie\" Dola is treated like a dog by the duo, and often exists to make the siblings look smart. Problem is, she is of average to decent intelligence. This isn't a problem when you have characters like Watson summarize Sherlock's action in order to help us understand a genius, but Dola's role comes as demeaning to her as it does for the audience. For example, during the alleyway gambit where Dola tried to win one time by predicting the gender of the person passing through on the main road, Dola got everything wrong while Sora and Shiro got everything right, on the assumption that the percentage of the sex ratio learned more towards the men from previous observations, although not too heavily. Honestly? Dola did not seem to be applying a strategy, but rather evidence that uncertainty means that loss is fairly possible while requiring extraordinary amounts of skill. That being said, the fact is that Dola is correct. She should have been right one or two times, especially if Sora and Shiro took the opposite bet.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously? Dola has no other role than to provide fanservice, some exposition, and well....nothing else, really. One could say she contributed to the last arc, and I think that is a pile of honky, considering everything.\\n\\n\r\nJibril is someone I find attractive, and is skilled in games herself.  I don't have much to say about her, and that is perhaps the most damning of all, besides her role essentially being a more informed exposition machine that makes the world building effortless, and barely does anything for her character. Her role being that she read a great deal of books, this is expected I suppose, but I feel disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nTo ramble on about the plot, I feel that some of the criticism of how the games are handled only as a response to the praise of its intelligence, while I took this anime on my second viewing as one treating style over substance.\\n\\n\r\nTo answer the question, no, I do not find anything to be intelligent to how these games are resolved, or even if. The gambles the siblings makes are so over the top that they can't possibly lose. The games are poorly defined in the rules and thus, so are the limits of what can be expected in a normal gameplay. Essentially, the show doesn't define what the game is, and attempts to subvert your expectations by an out of left field win that doesn't \"break\" the rules, but also causes me to be less interested when I know the lack of unspecified or vague limits are what allow this, and only makes it more confusing while watching it, but clear in retrospect. If you don't define the limits, then there is no need to write yourself in a hole. That being said, when you can write just any solution, from the Chess Match to the Game with Jibril, that doesn't require intelligence of either the author or the characters. It is rather dumb if the solution is too out there, or the rules and the gameplay are only revealed at their most important, but I suppose the fun is the aspect that I perceive should be taken from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHow fun is it? Not really. Having seen these tropes a thousand times can do that, and of course, cliches aren't inherently bad. In fact, I am a fan of a few myself. However, with these characters, they run the gamut from irritating comic relief to just boring and underdeveloped. Add on the idea of the extreme wish fulfillment of the show, and the whole work seems annoying.\\n\\n\r\nWe got two characters who don't grow, but who are complete failures in our world for seemingly good reason, binge gaming while subsisting on mysteriously procured ramen, where they are recognized for their intelligence by an otherworldly being, and taken to a world where there flaws don't matter or go away, and earning themselves a kingdom to lord over. They are baffling intelligent that they never lose regardless of the stakes. The solutions are not clever, but are made up on the spot, as the rules that \"allow\" it, sometimes lacking an adequate explanation or not taking advantage of the whole \"cheating\" angle that was presented for 30 seconds.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation Studio Pixar said it best. \"You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.\" Of course, what Sora and Shiro do is beyond most of people's capability, but their effortless winning with a mind and reflexes that cannot be sharpened any further. They are apex in this new society, and don't have to come to terms about why they were not previously successful. This is perhaps the most upsetting part. Intelligence, or being gifted in anyway isn't entitlement to recognition. A king should earn his kingdom, it is not given to him by chance. A man should woo his beloved, not wait for her to fall in his lap. A smart person is recognized for his achievements, not his IQ score.\\n\\n\r\nOne might say that NGNL is instead an extreme meritocracy. I can see and agree with it; it seems far better to have intelligent people in office than rampant nepotism we have now, and there seems to be a great deal of viable people in the various governing powers. However, I look at the premise as \"How convenient\" when Sora and Shiro are whisked to another world that plays to their strengths and nothing against their weaknesses. There is no portal in the real world waiting to teleport one to a fantasy world where they are king and queen, and there is no world where one is completely without weakness. It is a masturbatory practice with faux conflicts and predetermined outcomes that are badly written here, to lessen the burdensome reality of what one may be, essentially using fantastical elements to lessen any conflict one would encounter on Earth. Or rather, regardless of the setting, realistically speaking. That being said, I have to wonder how their flaws don't apply to the world of Disboard in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to like this anime, I would say go ahead. I am not here to categorize the entire fanbase into one tiny box, if my review did seem that way, but the type of viewer the anime wants to attract and how it goes about it.\\n\\n\r\nDisclaimer out of the way, this anime felt superficial, seemingly more of a corporate product made to sell than an artistic piece. It incorporates hackneyed tropes for its characters and attractive designs to distract from the more vacuous than playful nature of the anime most important aspect, the characters and events. The entire structure of cast and story are contrived in order to appeal to a normal but in the long term senseless view based on the myopic experiences of normal teenagers, but instead of sympathy, it is an indirect justification. In that, yes, they deserve recognition and that the world sucks. It is true the world is unfair, or difficult, but the views presented lack adequate insight on the flaws of such a troubled view, and lacks a viable solution as a result. There are no portals, no otherworldly entities wanting to teleport the worthy, and I doubt that life would be all peachy if there were such a thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe opposite of a coming of age story may not be regression, but stagnation. One has to deal with it sooner or later, and given the first episode. Sora and Shiro did not, and did not have to for the remainder of the adpation, which not only made them boring, but also the anime. Style is not viable if the characters are neither charismatic or interesting, and there is nothing of substance about the larger story. \\n\\n\r\nI see nothing, nothing of worth here. It's day in the limelight will be usurped by another of similar quality and similar intentions, and perhaps its forgetful nature speaks volumes about NGNL's transient nature. \\n\\n\\n",

The background may be a little clich\u00e8 but it doesn't matter because its story is one of a kind.

While there are only 10 out of 30 pieces that are worth listening, almost all of then are matching the anime with the story.\\n\r\nThe number of caracters presented is a little low to my knowledge but for a 12 episode season, it should suffice. Sora is one of the best strategist ( Lelouch, behold a worthy opponent) and Shiro is a genious that may outsmart even Light, who knows? \\n\r\nSome of you may say that is childish but for me the hype is real! I'm not very picky with animes and because of this I've seen at least one anime per genre and this one is outstanding. To not be a fanboy, I'm saying that is outstanding but far from the best. Maybe in my top 10 list it would be present but when the second season will appear, it shall be judged in order to earn its place among the best of the best.",

And people who want to reach out to either parties would give it 6-8. \r\nThe biggest complaint of story, as I have seen from other reviews, is that even Fantasy needs to abide by some logic, and NEETS  can't suddenly be all too social in a game, andobviously can't have super-human powers, and that there is no explanation regarding to this. And that the story is simple \"wish-fulfilment\", and it is not worthwhile to watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut in my humble opinion the story actually has depth, something which most people fail to understand. It can be related to real-life situations. In this world at every point of time we are playing a game, and in waging something as a bet. When choosing a new anime to watch you are wagering \"time\" and if you are entertained enough after watching it, you have obviously won the game, and feel satisfied, and if you loose, you are heavily disappointed. It's same even in an mcq test for a college entrance, where your life is decided by just one question. Can't blame if you haven't gone through do-or-die experience but for those who have gone, it is highly relatable, and it would be highly incorrect to say, the story is simple fantasy. The only difference is that on most occasions, the opponent is ourselves. And at some other instances, our opponent can be \"luck ,destiny, or fate\", or whatever it is called. \\n\\n\r\nMoreover, NGNL, is just 12 ep anime, and for obvious reasons, it cannot provide too many things (like cover all the backstories of the characters, or create heavenly mindblowing and overarching  story) in such a small amount of time. If it did, it would be just a plain garbage. \\n\\n\r\nStill, let's get the facts cleared\\n\\n\r\nIs it overhyped and over-rated?\\n\r\n>>Yes\\n\\n\r\nDoes it deserve to remain in good-books?\\n\r\n>>Again, yes.\\n\\n\r\n#Otaku scale=10. \\n\r\nWell, if you are a true otaku, stop reading my review and watch this show right now, because you cannot be disappointed with this show, there is Steph- Miss Fanservice, Jibril- Sexiest angel ever created, Shiro- The queen of all lolis who will eventually rule the whole world with her cuteness, and lastly Sora- The greatest harem king of all times, and needless to say, \"Insert ME in the Character\"-type protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nIf you aren't a true otaku, read further.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in a virtual reality, where the god of the world has invited the duo-Sora and Shiro- collectively known as 'blanks'. The world is ruled by ten pledges, and that games decide everything. The players wager something of equal value, and the winner gets it all.\\n\\n\r\nEverything said the plot is definitely not in the least original. Pulled into the game, ie, Virtual Reality - from an anime that doesn't even needs its name mentioned. Then there is game decides everything, from Mondiachi. Next up, is FMAB's equivalent exchange. Also Sora's character is mainly a rip-off from Lelouch-perverted edition. Not being original is not a crime, but so many references, is definitely not a very good aspect.\\n\\n\r\nPacing is meh! It starts out decently, but at a few points has the tendency of shifting into a typical harem-ecchi kind of thing, but fortunate enough, it comes back to the story not too late. Then again, it could have covered a little more in these 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it has a few worthwhile things to offer too. It doesn't introduce dues-ex-machina and doesn't have simple ass-pulss, and most things are planned, giving it a vibe of an intelligent anime. Some of them are really well thought out, and most often than not, you will be heavily surprised, by the alludes made to action which were previously deemed as insignificant. And then \"dialogues\"-  Most of them spoken by Sora, some of them having real-life implications. It gives a slight philosophical vibe to it. Also expect some- real good gags which excellently mix up with the serious situations, and deliver some real exercise to cheek muscles.\\n\\n\r\nUndebatable the best part has to be the games, which are very intelligently thought out. What elixir is to life, The games of NGNL are to entertainment, and I am not exaggerating in the least. It's hella fun to watch them.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, and the most important part of the story has to be undoubtedly, CUTENESS, after all \"cuteness is justice\". And it is applicable even if you are not an otaku. Shiro is the queen of all lolis, and every time she says \"Nii\" I am pretty sure someone's illness is cured, and that's the level of cuteness I am talking about. Jibril is too hot and sexy and I doubt words can praise her enough.\\n\\n\r\n(Story:8/10; -1 for lack of originality, -1 for some needless fanservice)\\n\\n\r\nAnother good part of the anime is the Main Characters. They are borderline badass, and its more entertaining to see these kinds of protagonists rather than complete badass type (Looking at you Tatsy from Mahouka, and Tokuchi from One Outs) where you are 100% sure, that the protagonist is gonna win, even if the earth were to end, they would get oxygen cylinder and survive. Most often than not, the characters are gonna pushed to their limits, and will have to make their way out, and these instances are heavily enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the supporting cast is not too strong, and are mostly okayish! Some serve for pure moe-service while some others are for mostly comedy parts. Eg. Steph, her grandfather, Jibril etc. There is some slight character development (I don't know if it can be even called that!) in Steph, who is one of the main characters, with her changing perspective of the Shiro-Sora duo. \\n\\n\r\n(Character: 7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation can be best explained as- the place where Disney/Cartoon meets Anime. Seriously, if I were to see Steph on some random poster, my first guess would be that she is a disney character. But all of  this shouldn't really come as a surprise as it is done by Madhouse, which is famous for making over-the-top loli/moe. And Madhouse proves itself once again. Also the colours went well with the light-hearted mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound is excellent and brilliant. The opening and ending songs, undoubtedly explain the blank's relationship in the best manner possible with fitting lyrics. The soundtracks are prolly good, and there doesn't remain much to be criticized either. I would like to applaud the voice actors- especially that of Sora's VA as his transitions from a jolly mood to completely Hikkimori mood who is practically crying is plenty amazing to see. \\n\\n\r\n(Animation and Sound:8/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow, enjoyment is one part where both lovers and haters of this show are gonna agree with me, it is hella enjoyable. Before, this anime, I considered Wednesdays as dull, but this anime single-handedly turned it into the day I looked forward the most. It was able to keep my every second spent on the anime as completely worthwhile, with amazing jokes, plot-twists, and even on instances of fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nIt has some heavily dreadful cliffhanger, and literally anime like Fairy Tail (2014) , Naruto should take this anime as an inspiration for how to create a cliffhanger, even with a preview!\\n\\n\r\nAs I already mentioned, the most enjoyable part has to be the games, and the anime is actually worth watching for that part alone. You may literally hate every other thing this anime has to offer, but I still don't think the games will be able to disappoint anyone.\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment: 10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOkay, finally let's again get the facts clear!\\n\\n\r\nIs it the anime of the season?\\n\r\n>>Can't say, spring season was overloaded with fantastic animes, honorable mentions to Mushishi ZokuSho, and Jojo. But even then NGNL, still remains as a candidate for the anime of the season.\\n\\n\r\nDoes it deserves to be in top #20?\\n\r\n>>Honestly, no. But I can't care too much as most users have their lists subjective (myself included), and the rankings simply measure the amount of fans the anime has able to garness.\\n\\n\r\nDoes it need a second season?\\n\r\n>>Hell yes! If this doesn't get second season, my hope for humanity will be destroyed.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall: 30%-story, 30%-characters, 30%-enjoyment, 10%-sound, animation=8.3~8)\\n\\n\r\n**Civilized criticism is always welcome**\\n\\n",

            "content": "Surprisingly unique anime with quite interesting plot and very exceptional characters. It could've been certainly better from many aspects, but it's real fun to watch.\r\nThe best thing I liked about this series is the unique fantasy world it's set in. As a gamer since childhood, the title itself was enough to capture all my attention to this anime, and watching the first few minutes, I got all worked up about it. A world where even wars are settled with games.! It might not seem that hard of an idea to come up with, but I am pretty sure I've never seen something like it inany actual anime or film before.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strength point is the characters. Imho, most animes tend usually to have quite similar frequent characters, which you could predict all their reactions really easily. I won't say that ALL characters in this series are exceptions, actually, they're mostly not. However, the two protagonists (I suppose we should assume they're always together!), are strong exceptions. More particularly, Sora is one of the rare inspiring anime characters I've seen lately, I'd say he's a lot like Yagami Light from deathnote, and I really love that!\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think the plot could have been much more into game than it's at the moment. I haven't read manga and the series didn't depict much of it yet, but so far, I didn't actually feel it's that much of a game world. Well, other than the fact that it's a world where all conflicts are resolved with games, there's basically no much signs of video games within the series. I mean, I think it would've been way more fun if the general themes were more deeply set into a gaming world. Like; scenarios, animation, and drawing styles could all be possibly altered to reflect a game-based world, and I am sure I was going to enjoy that a lot.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, as much as it's frustrating, the art is actually weak. I like the coloring style, but it sometimes makes it hard to distinguish things clearly. I am pretty sure graphics could have been a lot better. Still, they're fine more or less.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not one of the best anime series ever made, but most definitely, it's unique and so damn fun.",

But then one faithful day (imagine SnK effect here), they are sent to a fantasy world where everything is decided by games. GAME is the law. Don't be fooled, its nothing like SAO.\r\nIf the plot aint enough for you, there is some ecchi elements. But please mind that this anime is all about wit and passion. This anime tells you that wit is everything.\r\nVisuals are stunning, watch it atleast at 720p. Characters are verywell derived and everyone feels alive. All the soundtracks fits perfectly with the anime. Well i was hooked to the anime from Ep 1 itself and probably my all time Fav. Its witty, funny and ecchi at the same time. Even if you don't find my review satisfying or think that the plot suck (Ah must be another SAO), you will regret not watching it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The Video Review is up, Here is my Written Review\r\nHave you ever wondered how your life will be, if everything was solved by playing a game, this anime grasp a rather popular genre with an interesting concept, but it lacks support from the characters and the ending\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nThis is a story about two sibling gamers who are good at every type of game they play, known as \u2018Blank\u2019. They become bored of the world they live in, and one day gets a challenge from an unknown player in chess. They beat this unknown player, however that unknown player was actually a god named Tet,who brings the two siblings into his own world known as Disboard. A world where there is no conflict and everything is sorted by games. Simply put, if you want to rob someone, beat them in a game. Want to become a king, beat them in a game. Want to conquer other territories and factions, beat them in a game. And if you want to be god, earn the right to face him off in a game, meaning, don\u2019t lose on your way there. Sora and Shiro make it their goal to become god of Disboard, and to do that, they must conquer every territory in Disboard, in order to have one final faceoff against Tet, for the position of God.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story is actually rather well done, with some minor distractions here and there. Each game is paced quite well and cleverly done. The games don\u2019t take too long, nor do they finish too quickly, I felt like the games were at just the right pace. However, between games the story gets kind of boring, as in nothing really happens. It feels like those episodes were there to make the other supporting cast interesting, but in actuality, they really didn\u2019t get development. So those stories in between was just used to build the upcoming game, and I don\u2019t think it needed that much to build up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSora and Shiro make up for our main protagonist in No Game No Life. They\u2019re  the inseparable brother and sister combo known as \u2018Blank.\u2019 Because if they were separated apart they panic like crazy. Sora becomes a quivering, spineless coward and Shiro becomes almost catatonic. Sora is probably the absolute main protagonist, as he does most of the talking, and Shiro is kind of just there to be the badass player. However despite these characters being likeable and someone you would cheer for, they are unfortunately not developed. Throughout the whole show, it never really seemed like they change their attitudes towards different games as if they\u2019ve played the game before, and know it already. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main character in the show is Stephanie Dola, the princess of human kingdom. Now her role in the anime is kind of a target to everyone\u2019s pleasing. She is filled with fan service, as we always seem to never see her properly dress. Her role felt like she was to be a useless bystander who\u2019s completely na\u00efve, as she is what usually triggers Sora to explain their gaming strategy to the audience, so in theory, we the audience, are Stephanie Dola, and that\u2019s kind of slap in the face to us. Because at time, she is shown to bet somewhat intelligent, but is clearly outsmarted by our protagonists and she is shown to do dumb things as well.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for the majority of the cast, they never really felt fully developed. They all have unique and interesting backstories, but apart from that, they don\u2019t seem to grow as the show goes on. Sora and Shiro, are always confident in their games, and never seem to think otherwise. Whereas the supporting characters were just there for the sake of fulfilling a certain role in Sora\u2019s harem.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 8/10, 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and colour palette is really refreshing for an anime. The art style uses quite a lot of neon colours, favouring red and blue. The art style is really unique and works well with this anime, as we are in a game world sort of, where everything is sort of peaceful and is handle ideally by playing games. This can be seen as when we were in the human world originally at the start of the anime, Sora and Shiro\u2019s room are completely dark, and the light you can see is there computer monitors. However at times, it can get super bright, because of the art style. Some of the 3D used, is kind of bad, it doesn\u2019t fit well with the style. The game set pieces are quite good though, especially the last one being a very fast pace action sequence. However there is one glaring problem, I find with this anime, and it is its use of fan service. Honestly it felt unneeded, and added nothing towards the anime. It felt completely overused.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite good for my liking. The opening theme is epic, and really catchy, which really gets you pumped up for the show. The ending theme is rather forgettable, despite being sung by Shiro\u2019s voice actor. The soundtrack for the show does a really good job in accompanying the game set pieces in the anime. It really as a good variety of music to suit the different genre of games, and adds some electronica, to what already sounds like an epic JRPG soundtrack, which is a huge plus. The gaming theme techno soundtrack is really enjoyable to listen to, and gets intense. However it only peaks during the games, the soundtrack is rather forgettable when there isn\u2019t a game being played.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing that bothers me about this show. It\u2019s the way our main characters approach every game. Because their philosophy a game is won, before it even starts. They always have some master plan and strategy, that will always get them the win. And so knowing the characters are going to win the whole time, is kind of predictable and boring. However, the show insist that we watch as it cleverly unfolds the strategy behind the characters, and that is what is enjoyable. The journey path to getting the win, is what makes this anime exciting. They also make use of simple games, and turn it into intense games, such as a simple scissors, paper, rock game or even flipping a coin. There is always some sort of calculations for every game, and surprisingly seeing glimpses of that, is kind of enjoyable and rewarding. However when there isn\u2019t a game being played, it is kind of boring and generic. The characters don\u2019t do anything special between games, as they just research all the time. And I enjoy the concept of the anime, but I think the characters weren\u2019t doing much to make the story interesting.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story of I give it a 9, because I love the concept and enjoyed it a lot. I thought each game was paced perfectly. The games were exciting to watch, even though I knew were going to win, but the path to winning is the most exciting thing you\u2019re going to get out of this anime. However without a proper ending, the show feels really incomplete.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound, I give it both and 8. The animation and art style is really unique and well done. The colour palette is refreshing and suits the show. However the 3D is less than desirable, while the fan service is kind of unneeded. The soundtrack is really good, when they\u2019re playing the games, but other than that, it is nothing special. The opening song is epic and amazing, but the ending is forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters get a 6 from me. The main protagonist Sora and Shiro are both character\u2019s you would route for, but the other characters aren\u2019t really that interesting outside their backstory. And all the characters in the show, aren\u2019t really developed at all, they pretty much maintain the same throughout the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nFor my personal enjoyment, I give it an 8, as it was really exciting watching how they come away with a win, even if the whole premise set is up as a win the game before it even started scenario. My biggest problem was getting to know the characters more and the fan service getting in the way.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score of No Game No Life, I give it an 8/10. It has really interesting concept with exciting set pieces, but the characters are lacking and fan service gets really distracting. I recommend this anime to fans of comedy/adventure, gaming genre or even psychological anime fans. Because there are some intense moments in the anime, just be wary of the overuse of fan service, and try to enjoy the journey to the win, rather than expecting the win.",

            "content": "First of, I would like to establish the fact that No Game No Life has been one of the best anime I have been given the privilege to watch. It is impeccable by all means. Furthermore, this cannot be compared to any other 'Virtual Reality' anime, due to the fact that the main characters' motive is to rule the land as opposed to beating it (cough Sword Art Online cough)\r\nLet's begin with the tale. Two NEETS, on an adventure? It's very much the opposite of most anime in this genre; that the protagonists are viewed low by society. \r\nIn comparison for instance, to Kirito whois not disrespected whatsoever. In fact, Kirito is neutral to the community's eyes.\\n\\n\r\nAs opposed to Sora and Shiro? Who are mere NEETS, and only provided respect in the gaming world. They have said it themselves that they are viewed lowly in the community. These characters are intriguing, and whimsical at many instances. Especially Sora, who is the leader of the two; providing commands and leadership. Additionally, Sora makes a lot of jokes, which benefit to character development not only for the individual, but for the other characters such as Stephanie, in which he mocks her grandfather, and well, more for you to explore. The only peeve against characters is that one of them was introduced significantly late; I would've enjoyed if she stayed longer, but anime aren't perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt design is outstanding. A barrage of colours overwhelms 10 minutes into the anime. It's spectacular, and kudos to the art designers. \\n\\n\r\nSound is prolific, with the clashing of swords sounding as realistic as The Sims 4. Atmospheric sounds such as whispers and moans from the environment provide an effect, but sometimes may be generic. Gun sounds are superb in one of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed every single bit of this anime. The various references to anime culture (spot the Ace Attorney!) and ecchi fanservice which fills up to the brink! Hilarity with every episode, despite the themes suggested within each. Gaming culture involved as well, with FPS references, Dating Sim references and varieties more spurting out of this anime!\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime to anyone 13+. The only barrier to me opening it to the public is the occasional swear, and almost hentai graphics. Enjoy!\\n\\n",

Honestly, when I first watched it, I thought it would be something like Sword art online, which I don't really like (sorry for all the fans) but I was wrong. This anime is very different from anything I've seen before. \r\nThe story itself is very unique, the characters are fun. I love every one of them. And then the art. I absolutely love the art. It's so colorful and happy. It will get you cheered up in no-time.\r\nOverall I give thisanime a 8. I really enjoyed it.",

At least, they aren't sucked in a video game which is the heavily-abused plot right now. Well it's about two hiki-NEET siblings, Sora and Shiro which make up the infamous gaming team, \u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f (Blank), who are unstoppable in any game they play, which as I suggested were transported to another world called Disboard, in which the ten oaths of the races forbid violence and decrees that everything can only be settled by games, bythe world's supreme deity, Tet. The series follows their adventures in expanding the territory of Imanity (equivalent of humanity in Disboard) and their quest to conquer or ally with all the Exceeds (races) in Disboard in an attempt to challenge Tet.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt has an \"ethereal\" feel to it because of it's art style which makes everything appear reddish. It still looks HD, nonetheless. It gives me a break from all the normal graphics from the other anime I see.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThey didn't utilize sound that much in emphasizing the atmosphere, etc. They just used it in a casual way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting characters are obviously Sora and Shiro. With their extreme intelligence and scarily-accurate foresight, they aren't called the main characters of the anime for nothing. They're closeness to each other and Shiro's cuteness adds more points but other than them the remaining characters are either for fanservice purposes or comic relief only.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWith a mix of clever game tactics, comedy, fanservice and the quest to challenge God, No Game No Life will be very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, with a mix of comedy, clever tactics and strategies, an easy-to-follow plot, fanservice and otaku culture, it's a highly-recommended anime that you will surely like.",

            "content": "Rule: Respect my opinion and I will respect yours.\r\nNow let's get onto the review that I long hold since 2014. Now it's new year time. \r\nSTORY (6):\r\nThe story follows the 2 dynamic duo siblings by the name of Sora & Shiro. Sora is the brother and Shiro is the sister. They are both NEETs and they are transported into the fantasy world of Disboard, by Tet, the world's last remaining God and also their former opponent. \r\nSo basically Sora & Shiro are going on their adventure into the world of Disboard to redeem human race of Imanity. \r\nAs you know, when I first saw thisanime being overhyped, I was not very excited because as you know I am not interested in anime that has wish-fulfilment characters like for example Tatsuya Shiba from Mahouka. This anime was produced by Madhouse who also produced Mahouka, an anime which I didn't enjoy that much.\\n\\n\r\nART (7):\\n\\n\r\nI will give credit for the animation. The animation made use of sunset colors just like in the Pet Girl from Sakurasou. The animation of characters are designed good.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (5):\\n\\n\r\nOk. The problem with this show is the characters. Jibril was decent. The only characters that carry the show are Sora & Shiro. I do like their comradery. However the problem is they are the only ones that shine while the rest of the characters are left to dust. Every game they participate, they won every time. \\n\\n\r\nIf your character wins every time, your character will lose credibility. A great character is a character that is put through difficult situations yet persist under pressure.\\n\\n\r\nAnd not to mention Stephanie Dola. OMG! She is the worst character I have seen all year. All she does is annoy the living hell out of me. She was plain annoying. Not even fit for comic relief character. Her voice and her personality was super annoying. Every time, I see her on screen, I wanted to strangle her. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (6):\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not as good as the fans praise it to be neither it is as bad as the haters claim it to be. I did enjoy some parts of this anime and especially some characters. However, this doesn't change the fact that this anime is nothing special to me. \\n\\n\r\nI give it a 6/10.",

            "content": "This is an anime about 2 game addicted neets written by people who have never playing a game competitively or talked to anyone who was a neet. If these characters are half as smart as they are said to be, they would easily succeed in the real world. But they choose to become neets. I have no idea why at this point because I dropped this at episode 2. From what it shows of them in the real world, they are just amazing at games. Like they are MLG 420 no scope tier so much so that they can't lose at anything, there might aswell be hit marker in every scene. How they don't just join some pro gaming scene can only be explained by the writers never having heard of professional gaming. The little one is suppose to be able to beat top chess AIs because she is sooooo smart. Maybe if she just demoed that in the real world, they wouldn't have to be neets but alas, no such thing as being a professional chess player exists. \\n\\n\r\nThe big one is suppose to be so smart and strategic and the little one is suppose to be a super intelligent super computer or something (shes a human but so smart that she doesn't have any emotions or anything). These 2 are suppose to make up the main cast but I can't seem to relate to either of them at all. Their arrogance is just so apparent that I'd rather root for anyone but them. Their only humanity seem to be when they are making terrible sexual jokes. Their online name they use is \"\" (blank), because that way, their name is as empty as their soul. I almost cut myself on that edge. They are said to never interact with other players except when beating them so I assume they have no social skills what so ever. \\n\\n\r\nBecause these 2 shitheads can't seem to do anything exept be edgy neet gamers in the real world, they get sent to another world where games rule and everything is govern by games. And so everything changes. Because they changed world, somehow that cures them of their aspergers because suddenly the big one can now read social ques and talk to people. \\n\\n\r\nThis new world doesn't seem different to me from the real world but now there are like 10 rules and they are all poorly defined what happens seems to be everyone just jump through loop holes and cheats to win, just like how laws work in real life for people who abuse them! Except there are no lawyers. So everyone not abusing the rules get screwed even more and not just the ones who can't afford armies of lawyers. \\n\\n\r\nWhich is dumb because if you were to take any challenge in this world, you'd have to be idiot to not draft a binding document with all the terms defined or else you are going to get cheated. They immediately demonstrate the need for lawyers by introducing the third character becoming enslaved because of little technical wording when rules are defined. She to contribute as much to the show as Yoko did in TTGL, which is tits and ass (since in the little one already has the loli fan service covered I guess). Shes just their to be a joke about how dumb she is and how much tits and ass she has. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of how inherently flawed I found the show to be from the start and how I can't relate at all to these edgy non characters. I can't see why this show is so highly rated. I guess this show would have been more interesting if I was younger but all the echi makes me think this isn't aimed at younger kids, I think even as a teenager I would have seen through how dumb everything was. \\n\\n\r\nI can only say this show would have probably been more interesting if the characters were more likable because the actual plot and elements aren't that bad once you look past all the logical bullshit that I was complaining about. I don't really have a problem with most of the story elements being that way but since I couldn't relate to the characters, the show made me focus on them so much more so. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the sound and art is decent I guess but their aren't really interesting in any way, the art is just overly colorful and the sound is what you'd expect from a anime with some budget. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't mind characters that only have sexual jokes and being really smart as their only traits, then this can probably be good. Otherwise I can't recommend.",

            "content": "Imagine yourself sitting in front of a cake, a really really colorful cake. It's a medium sized cake, the size you could eat on your own, but not without hating yourself. You stick a finger into the frosting to get a taste, and oh boy is it sweet. You can't wait, quickly getting utensils and cutting yourself a healthy portion. As you cut the cake open, you notice that it's a single layer, with small clumps of what you assume to be chocolate chips scattered throughout. Mouth watering, you quickly take your first few bites. The cake itself tastes wonderful, and goes well with thesweet frosting. However, the small clumps were not chocolate chips, but sticky, gooey caramel. The caramel doesn't go well with the cake or the frosting, but it's spaced out enough that you decide to suck it up and keep eating. Besides, the cake and frosting on their own are so so good. Before you realize it, you're finishing up the last slice, quickly swallowing the caramel to avoid the taste. \"That's it?\" you mutter to yourself, feeling like a terrible person for eating an entire cake in one sitting. You're left sitting in front of a finished plate, unsatisfied and a little disappointed. I'm Zepphire, and that cake was No Game No Life. \\n\\n\r\n(I rate anime a little differently, and am currently working on a explanation on my page. In short, I consider Plot and Story to be separate entities, and include the op/ed in the rating.)\\n\\n\r\nOP/ED: 7/10 \\n\r\nThe OP is great, amazing music, good animations. I'm a sucker for any instrumental solo, so that small piano part at the beginning  The only issue I have is that it fails to give a heads up of the comedy in the anime. The ED is nothing crazy, and mostly fanservice. The OP is definitely more important than the ED, so I feel like a 7/10 is pretty fair.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nThere isn't really anybody that interesting in the end. While the anime brings up an interesting metaphor about the two main characters, Sora and Shiro, who view reality as an \"unfair game\". But it's never really expanded on. They're shut-ins, that's it. The fan service and out-of-place comedy completely ruined any emotional attachment I had to the any of the characters. Nobody else is worth mentioning other than Stephanie, who's just brain dead. Only thing raising my score above a 2 is the fact that Sora had moments where he was really bad-ass, that's it. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nThis has to be one of the best Isekai setting that I have experienced. The whole premise with the 10 rules is well thought out and quite unique. The games and acts that take place are really well thought out, each with its own ingenious solution that allows the protagonists to defy the odds every time. However, there are a couple things that just seem out of place. Like the many bath scenes (which are clearly just fan service), or Sora thinking with his dick and the events that follow. Most of the fan service scenes just seem unfunny and not necessary.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 5/10\\n\r\nThe story follows a pretty solid plot through it's 12 episodes. It feels like most of the encounters that the characters go through are meaningful towards the plot (except the fanservice moments, which don't advance anything). Most of the people they meet along the way end up being important to the plot in some fashion, even Stephanie. But the end leaves us with literally no closure, it's a cliffhanger that isn't even that good. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nNGNL's art is spot on. The unique color scheme is excellent, and one of its best qualities. The quality of background visuals is quite impressive for a 4 year-old anime. Everything is really well done, not much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics (Voice Acting+Music): 7/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting and music are not bad at all, but they aren't anything incredible. Voice acting remains pretty average throughout, with some pretty good moments here and there. As for music, its not really that noticeable, which is both good and bad. But the sound effects are really well done, and fit the dramatic shifts very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the actual \"game\" parts of this anime. But the fanservice was just disappointing, I can't stress it enough. But everything else was somewhat enjoyable for me.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this cake to somebody else? Well... If you think you will like the fanservice moments, then be my guest. Or if you like getting your mind blown by the crazy solutions or cheats to whatever game they're playing. But if you don't think you'll enjoy the fanservice, I think it's worth to watch the first couple, if you loose interest after then, you're not missing out on much.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I watch NGNL over the course of 5 to 6 days. This is different for me cause i can normally watch a 12 part season in two days. But this was something that i had to force myself to finish.\r\nThe show while not bad. I enjoy the art style and the side characters. The only problem that i had that made this take so long for me to finish is the two MC's \r\nThe two MC's aren't really fun to have on screen. They tend to act so righteous and full of them self. For me it comes across as annoying. They are also theworst part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSorra/Shiro: They are so rude to other people ( One more than the others) They act so high and might and think they're the shit. When i think back at it. If it wasn't for these characters i probably would've had a better time with this. They even go and make fun of how shit Stephanie's grandfather was right in front of her. Sorra at one point when and made Stephanie force her to fall in love with him. He also sexually harasses Stephanie, They also start calling her Steph as an insult such as \" You are such a Steph\" \\n\\n\r\nStephanie : She is the character i feel the worse for. She is the only normal person and actually works hard for her goals. She is constantly humiliated and insulted all through out. I feel that she is the one who should've been the King and not the MC's. Hell, I would like if she was the MC and all the other girls are her companions.\\n\\n\r\nJibril : Is a fun character to have on screen. She is my second favorite character in the show. Not too much to say besides that i think she is just a good character. \\n\\n\r\nChlammy: She is an alright character i guess. She get's very little screen time. So it's hard to tell. But i do like that she isn't a Villain really. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe MC's are just way to powerful in this world and as a result they're just not fun. There isn't any real feel that the MC's might be defeated at all. I know for a fact that they will always win. \\n\\n\r\nAt one point the MC's were fighting Jibril and it seemed like she was close to winning. I would've loved this. She is meant to be a god killer weapon. So when she is beaten by a dumb way it's very annoying. I think if she had beaten them but still decided to help them that this would've been better. Would give some sense that the MC's might lose in the future.\\n\\n\r\nThe world its self is kind of dumb. The rules set in place and the god who placed these rules are also dumb. The entire way this thing is set up doesn't make sense and just had dumb stuff happens. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nice and fast paced. While the sound is also pretty nice except a couple times they use stock sound bites it seems. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i don't get what's up with this praise for this show. Not bad but it's not great. If it wasn't for the side characters i think i would be giving this a 5 or even a 4. Because without them all we has in nice art style, Crappy stories and awful MC's.",

So you can imagine were this is going .. I found super interesting this show. Until now i've never seen such thing, and personally i enjoyeda lot. \\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship is really strong. In spite of they way of living (closed in a house playing all day long) they are really dedicated to each one. And in that world of games, they will learn how to communicate with others. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is unique. The pink tones make it look unreal, and it is unreal so express really well the idea of a fictional world, a world were there are just 10 laws, wich the last one is to having fun while playing the games :D. The art fits with this idea .. the characters are really artistic, each one with their own style totally different from the rest of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u00b4t want to tell you anything else cause i don\u00b4t want to ruin your experience, i just advise you to watch this one. It has a really interesting plot, interesting themes and it is really funny. In some episodes you need a lot of attention (due to the strategy that they apply to win the game) it may even get hard to understand, but once we understand, it gets surprisingly good to know how \"pro\" they are when the subject are games .. i mean that's why they never lost one single game xD not even bets they lost.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that this review will help you decide if you want or not watch this anime and if haven't think about seeing it, that this review changed your idea\\n",

            "content": "To be quite frank, NGNL is nowhere close to being an anime masterpiece. Thinking about it more carefully, nothing about its characters or plot is particularly interesting or original, and certainly nothing worth boasting about - but nonetheless, I was attached to this series like some sort of gross, humanoid leech.  \r\nAdmittedly, I am a slave to psychological games and long, complex strategies that have to be explained in full detail to people like me who suck at planning in detail. You know, when I first discovered Liar Game I thought I'd reached the pinnacle of my entire life - so I guess it'snot too far-fetched to say that watching Sora and Shiro kicking everybody's ass with their superior game knowledge was pretty satisfying. My favourite episode had to be the one where they played Materializaion Shiritori; besides being intense and a cool spin on the game, I could actually follow along with what was happening, whereas chess and card games are completely lost upon me. The plot itself was stagnant and, to put it bluntly, really predictable - rather, it was the actual games that kept me watching. The finale was horribly disappointing and anticlimactic, and I really just have to say the Shrine Priestess is so absolutely extra because randomly making her pop in through the last two episodes really ticked me off...\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were both good. NGNL's pretty eye-catching and flashy. The visual appeal of NGNL is undeniable - everything's bright and colourful and magical, I guess, as befits a fantasy world. I was a little bit disappointed but not unsurprised to see that the Exceed were all your standard fantasy races - I was expecting a little more originality in that department. How come, out of all 16 different races that inhabit the world, we only get to see 4 of the most generic ones? The soundtrack was energetic and upbeat, which I appreciated, and both the opening and ending songs were nice and catchy. I really liked the opening in particular.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Sora and Shiro together - I mean, who doesn't love genius sibling duos? As the main characters, I suppose it makes sense for the two of them to be the most likeable. I thought Sora's protective-older-brother moments with Shiro were pretty cute, to be honest. In comparison, Shiro plays the part of the adorable younger sister. Their abilities and strengths compliment each other and they basically work as a pair to cover all possible weaknesses - together, they form a supposedly unbeatable team called \"Blank\". These two are by far my favourite characters in NGNL. Everybody else lacked depth and were literally walking, talking tv tropes. Steph pissed me off in particular - sure, she's air-headed and cute and all, but her constant indecision and the fact that she changed opinions about Sora every three seconds was extremely annoying. I was curious to learn more about Ino and Izuna (I mean, what does a Warbeast Embassy even do?), but unfortunately not much was explained about their specific backstories so I guess that was a little disappointing too. \\n\\n\r\nI don't regret watching NGNL. I personally think that it's worth mentioning that I really liked watching it even though more than half of its characters pissed me off royally. Leave the personality and plot deconstruction for later. NGNL is, at its simplest, something that is meant to be fun, so before you write it off as a mere compilation of cliches, give yourself a chance to enjoy its comedy, flashiness and blatant fanservice first.",

            "content": "\"They say people can change, but is that really true? If they decide they want to fly, will they grow wings? I don\u2019t think so. You don\u2019t change yourself. You change how you do things. You have to make your own way. You have to create a way to fly, even while you stay the same. \"\r\n\u2015Sora to Shiro\r\nNo Game No Life blew up expectations of many (mine too) and managed to become considered one of the best anime's in 2014. It is an interesting assertion to state and here is my reason of what I think:\r\nStory:- 8 out of 10.\r\nWe're presented with the veryfamiliar 'trapped in a virtual or game world' setting where we follow the NEET (Not in Educatino, Employment, or Training) sibling duo: blank, Sora and Shiro who have conquered every game in 'real life' by their absurdly high intellect, gaming finesse, strategic prowess and unbreakable affinity with each other.\\n\r\nThis new virtual world is by no means your standard generic of games (MMORPG, FPS, RTS and etc), rather it is an open world filled with difference races which must abide by the Law of the Ten Oaths and to resolve everything through 'games'.\\n\\n\r\nThrow those two into this world and you get No Game No Life.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of not being limited to only one archetype of a game genre really contrasts itself from other Virtual/Game World settings. Where you have trivial games like rock paper scissors, and coin tossing that would be an imperative factor for certain situations and even bigger scale games like chess, shooting games and the likes. This broadens the target audience through its variability, and it's likability as a setting.\\n\r\nThe concept of having two NEETs who have conquered the real world and are much superior than 'humans' in that respect, to be thrown into an unknown world filled with laws that defy physics (magic, etc), puts the main characters on equal footing to the opponents which help in keeping the characters to stay relatively not over powered.\\n\r\nThe games are very nicely executed and are pretty standard - only with the twist in this new setting. They're nicely planned out and explained with logical reasoning afterwards which adds a realistic effect albeit inhumane intelligence. Not to mention, there's almost always a game in every episode which keeps the action refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nI think the plot of the story is easy to figure out - conquer the game.\\n\\n\r\nArt:- 8 out of 10.\\n\r\nThis is the definition of different, and refreshing - the style of the art juxtaposes that of the real world's colour palette. Keeping colours sharp and vivid allows the audience to keep in mind the setting is indeed a fantasy setting. The design of the characters and each races are well drawn out and full of moe, remembering it is indeed an ecchi anime. Having appropriate designs for each of the characters, e.g: Sora and Shiro looking rugged as NEET.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is of high standards. Keeping the action scenes fresh and innovative where it needs to follow with the protagonists absurd strategic ways.\\n\\n\r\nSound:- 8 out of 10.\\n\r\nThe OP is composed well in conjunction with the animation. It's not a thoughtless opening, it is full of connotations of the anime by introducing characters, the outstanding scenery and a basic idea of what it would be about; suitable for an opening.\\n\r\nThe OST/BGM is cleverly composed by adding an 'electronic, gaming' feel towards it supporting the structure of the setting, and having serious music fitting for each scene. It sounds great and is very important in delivering certain expressions of emotion; sadness, resolve - all done very well with respected sounds to achieve the feeling.\\n\r\nThe ED is a nice touch showing once again the bond between siblings, sung by Shiro herself which adds a connection and a more personal feel to it. Once again, it's not thoughtless a lot of symbolism about the siblings is integrated into this, and they put an extra touch (you'll see it when you watch it) to it which was very well done - personally one of my favourite parts of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is superb, and each character perfectly fit into each individual role - a lot of well known talented seiyuu's (voice actor/actress). No conflicts here, makes a distinction of each character - voices will be remembered for being distinct.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:- 9 out of 10.\\n\r\nThis is how you design characters, minus the fan service (but of course thats a +1) and you get nicely designed and lovable characters. The fact that the protagonists are human's let us relate to them especially in a gaming environment as the demographic of viewers are usually gamers as well, and not only that, they have similar interests and references of that we can relate to (moe, moe, moe)\\n\\n\r\nSora (\"sky\") - the older brother, half of blank who is more of the strategic, manipulative, out-spoken, intelligent and is very comedic (and sometimes a bit crazy). \\n\r\nShiro (\"white\") - the younger sister, half of blank who is more intelligent, has critical thinking and very fast problem solving. Full of moe.\\n\\n\r\nThe great thing about the protagonists (blank) is one can't do without each other - this creates the idea that each individual is not over powered at all, but can be when together. (episode 8). Being half-half they complete each other and fill each others lacking aspects, they also have an unbreakable bond of trust with each other which plays a very important role. This especially is true when put into this new world where their oponnents are as insanely intimidating with their powers and experiences, where as individuals they would not be able to do anything.\\n\r\nTheir immense teamwork + intelligence play is what makes the series so interesting and fresh (although it does seem very over-powered), they're not powerful through other means of generic power but through what is possible by humans - the greatest weapon: the brain and trust. Certain scenes keep you on the edge of your seats only to be dumbfounded in awe from how it gets resolved, and the best thing? It's logical albeit complex.\\n\\n\r\nStephanie Dola - she isn't very impactful in action scenes but she's important for creating the base foundation for the story. She's well developed but lacks spotlight and any importance other than what was aforementioned. She's fan service.\\n\r\nThe side characters (Jibril, Izuna, etc..) all have likable personalities and serve right as a side-character not having a huge impact but managing to support the plot in their own respected way. Don't forget, fan service.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:- 9 out of 10.\\n\r\nThis was my most anticipated anime every week and for the reason of everything stated above. It is definitely a great series with a strong plot, strong character dynamics and development, interesting premise of plot and very nice supportive sounds and art. Not only that but it had very comedic scenes, a lot of fan service added into all the other aspects which really created a package of awesomeness. Definitely recommended for people who enjoy a bit of everything which has been finely refined and well thought out.\\n\r\nIn summation, No game No Life was one of the best anime's for me in 2014, with its nicely composed plot and cleverly amalgamating character, sound, art to perfectly create this anime which was a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Spelling mistakes, grammatical structure, missed out on points.

I was in euphoria whilst watching this show, and highly recommend others to follow suit. So, without further ado, here is my review. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nAmazing story, to say the least. Especially at the beginning, there is enough mystery to intrigue the watcher but just enough is kept hidden so one never knows for sure what will happen. Spoilers aside, within the minigames, they do a marvelous job of using foreshadowing to hint at abilities that come in handy. The one part I did not likeabout the story was the first three minutes or so, but that is just my opinion and is basically irrelevant. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI think the art is what makes this show stand out. Vivid colors are everywhere, realistic representations of everything going on, and the feel of actually being with Sora and Shiro was enough to keep me going for four and a half hours. If one word could describe the art, it would be \"magnificentandbeautifulandmajesticandeverythingelse\".\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWho doesn't like the opening? The opening song, \"This Game\", is a marvelous way to kick off each episode. Furthermore, the soundtracks just blend in so well with each scene that you hardly notice that it's a soundtrack and not just sound effects. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nPeople may disagree with my choice here, but I feel like there is a little room for improvement here. I personally would have enjoyed a little bit more character development, as it does give a chance for foreshadowing and whatnot. But, that is just my humble opinion. Other than that, the characters are very likable (wink) and they did a great job of developing these interesting personalities. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest here, not all people will enjoy the show. The times where there were suggesting scenes may weird some people off, and the insanely well put together story may overwhelm some people. I think that experience in anime is almost a prerequisite to feel this greatness. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nVery minor flaws in this show. I enjoyed it from 3 minutes in to the very end, as this made me feel things that nothing before it has made me feel ever before. \\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend this to anybody who has watched at least a few shows that have a complex storyline, but otherwise, wait until you have grown. \\n\r\nThank you for reading my humble review. \\n\r\n~DoobDood",

The art adds to the fantasy element of the anime and makes it look brillant and a treat to viewers eyes. The story of this anime is good but not the best. I think the anime ended too fast with leaving us hanging waiting for seasontwo. The story revolves around two main characters who are extremely smart and you get the feeling that they are unbeatable. Eventhough they look unbeatable, us viewer get more and more exited by thinking of what will happen next. This element of the anime keeps the story as well as anime alive by not getting person watching it bored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, no game no life is a must watch anime. It is not the best anime but also not the worse anime. It is somewhere in between but where ever it is, it is great and enjoyable anime.",

            "content": "I like this anime because it was full of mind blowing events.\r\n*Story\r\n\"We(Human) are weak!\" that is one of the thing that i like from this anime. they , sora and shiro, said we , human , are weak. we are weaker than anything except animal. We don't have any powers or magic, We are weak. because we are born with nothing. Half of the story explaining or talking about humanity. \"Why we are weak?\" , \"Why we always lose to the strong?\". They were still believe in the potential of humanity , even thought they hate humanity. \r\nAnd half of it is the story ofSora , Shiro and the disboard world or the game world. The world where everything is decide by a game, and so the god made ten pledges. \\n\\n\r\n1.All murder, war, and robbery is forbidden in this world.\\n\r\n2.All conflict in this world will be resolved through games\\n\r\n3.In games, each player will bet something that they agree is of equal value\\n\r\n4.As long as it doesn't violate pledge three, anything may be bet, and any game may be played.\\n\r\n5.The challenged party has the right to decide the rules of the game.\\n\r\n6.Any bets made in accordance with the pledges must be upheld.\\n\r\n7.Conflicts between groups will be conducted by designated representatives with absolute authority.\\n\r\n8.Being caught cheating during a game is grounds for an instant loss\\n\r\n9.In the name of god, the previous rules may never be changed\\n\r\n10.Let's all have fun and play together!\\n\\n\r\nI really like that one too especially for the pledges 10. no one will suffer and no one will be killed in this world , in the game world. And the last , Sora and shiro teamwork. Blank never lose. i like those two that always find a way to win even it was looked like they will lose in my eyes. That was the meaning of mind blowing event that i said before. They always surprise me of they own way of playing the games. They always find a way inside despair , suffering and darkness. That what i like about them. When it comes to game, they will never lose\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\n*Art\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. \"Colorful but fun\" from every anime that i already watch, most of it, i like the colorful one like hamatora. The design of the character like Jibril and Tet is very good. The Warbeast girls was good too, the ears and the tails. The scenery or the place it good too.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\n*Sound\\n\\n\r\nI really love the Sound , especially the epic soundtrack when sora was speeching and playing a game. The opening and ending is very good to. Perfect fit to the story and character in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\n*Character \\n\r\nThe character was drew good too.\\n\r\n-Sora and shiro , the main character , a brother and sister that always playing a game ,and the bonds between them was very strong too. \\n\r\n-Steph , this character just normal for me, but i still feel bad for her because she is the foollest character ever in the anime.\\n\r\n-Jibril, from the outside look, she look very scary. \"like death itself\". but the truth she was just a funny person. She is the character i like from the anime.\\n\r\n-Tet , the god of play. he was the god of the disboard world. he was the one who make the world into a game world. i really like this character , but it was only happen for 3 episode. i thought he was did that all for the sake of the people , but the truth , he wasn't. he was never on anybody side.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the other , they all just a normal character in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\n\"Do you enjoy wathing this anime?\" Without a second thought i say \"i really enjoy it\".The most thing that i really enjoy in this anime is when sora and shiro playing a game. when they playing a game , it was look like they will gonna lose but the truth they already win. because they always win the game before the game start. that is their policy i guess. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 \\n\\n\r\n*Overall\\n\r\nI still curious about what happen on the last episode at the after credit scene. i just hope there's another season for this anime. \\n\r\nI really enjoy it. I really thankfull for MadHouse for making such an enjoyable show. The art is OK , The sound is Ok and The Character is OK for me. Only the story that i really like. \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nHope this review can be helpfull for you \\n\r\nThanks :D\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I don\u2019t know why I decided to begin No Game No Life, probably because it has a good score, but as usually happens, the score lies. Again and again.\r\nThis review won\u2019t contain spoilers.\r\nNo game No Life talks about two brothers that don\u2019t go to school and don\u2019t have any kind of social life, they simply spend all their time playing computer games. So much that you even ask yourself how they can be still alive. After winning a chess-game against Tet, a God, they are brought in a world where every conflict is decided by playing games. Their aim is to become gods of thisworld by defeating the final boss: Tet himself.\\n\\n\r\nEverything revolves on the sympathy between those two incredibly genious characters and the watcher, that wants to be a super sharp mind like those two unrealistic characters. This is the only reason that I can think about for its success. Wait I forgot breasts, it\u2019s full of stupid scenes where characters just randomly lose pieces of their clothes. And yes, this is a concern even in an ecchi anime, because it only adds stupidity to the whole show. And loli, there is so much loli that I don\u2019t even want to talk about that.\\n\\n\r\nThe fantasy world they are in seems somewhat challenging, full of obstacles and threats. This could have been interesting if the two brothers, Sora and Shiro, didn\u2019t win everything so easily. Since they have to be a \u201cmodel to follow\u201d by the watcher, they seem to be expert in litterally everything, from math to literature, without even going to school. They are so strong that they win every single game; even before a challenge starts, you know that they can\u2019t lose. They can\u2019t lose because everytime they bet everything, even their own life at some points, and the plot couldn\u2019t continue otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that is paricularly annoying is that instead of trying to win the games, everyone tries to find the best cheat to win. Infact the rules of this world say that you can cheat as long as you are not detected. So the characters are all focused on deceiving their opponent and there are really just a few games where they played following the rules.  \\n\\n\r\nBut how do they win? Their intelligence is so high that in ten minutes they could read and understand Einstein\u2019s general relativity paper, during the games they take advantage of things that they couldn\u2019t possibly know if they spend the whole day in front of videogames. The anime tries to put up the logical chain of thoughts that gave to our little Einsteins the victory, but everything seems only based on luck. Let me explain: there are so many things that could go wrong, so many things that they couldn\u2019t have planned in any possible way, that you can only ask yourself \u201cWhy the hell don\u2019t they play in a Casino and win millions to live the rest of their life in a royal palace?\u201d They could litterally conquer the whole Earth without any difficulty. Every little detail, even if they seem in trouble, is revealed to be a part of their plan. Someone trips? It was a part of their plan! Someone sneezes? It was a part of their plan! Someone farts? It was a part of their evil plan! They are too smart.\\n\\n\r\nOutrageous luck like a river in this anime flows. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good, drawings are well made and neon/pink colors, even if many criticize them, are perfect for the anime. Sound is nice too, there are some good OST that match the theme of the anime: videogames. Art is what raised my overall score from 4 to 5, well done Madhouse.\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve already said the two main characters are just unbelievably cunning and smart, but except for that, they are simply flat and without a real purpose in their life except than playing games and prove that Blank, the name that they gave to their team, is better than everyone else and can\u2019t lose. I find this a really weak aim for the life of two teenagers, but ok. They are also completely incosistent and meaningless, for example they spent their whole life in their room and they say that they suffer of agoraphobia, but in two minutes they just change completely, and Sora becomes a formidable orator. This hurts, a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t other interesting characters. Stephanie is here only for the sake of ecchi, she litterally doesn\u2019t do anything to advance the plot and is completely useless and stupid. She seems like a bonus to use when the anime has been serious for too long and the watcher needs some fanservice. Jybril is the same thing, but with a pair of wings.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big question mark is: but Sora and Shiro never asked themself what and where this world is? Why does this world exists? Where are their parents? Why they never talk about them or don\u2019t miss them at least? What the hell is wrong with those guys? No Game No Life doesn\u2019t give you any answer, the watcher just have to accept the fact that they have to become Gods. Ok.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point you are probably wondering why I gave to this anime a 5 instead of something much lower. Well, all in all it\u2019s entertaining, some parts are funny and some games are interesting. Strange that I didn\u2019t choose to drop it, maybe I just wanted to see what the producers were trying to put up next.  But there are way too many plot holes and inexplicable facts, and what I felt while watching No Game No Life was the disperate attempt to create a intelligent and badass character, that should be Sora, and creating an harem around him, because badass guys attract girls... \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it? If you have some free time and you don\u2019t have anything better to do. There are so many good anime around that it\u2019s a pity to waste time on this one, but if you are just searching an anime with a cool main character, then No Game No Life is probably for you.\\n\\n\r\nYou hate me because No Game No Life is the best anime ever? It was all my plan since the beginning!\\n",

I find this anime to be very polarizing, but mostly liked.\r\nThis is one of the only animes that did not give me much of an impression after I left, though. So I am just going to list my opinions of its pros and cons. I will leave out parts that aren't too good nor too bad.\r\nPro:\r\nNon-generic MCs= (genius siblings, one of them being a humansupercomputer and another who can manipulate \\n\r\n                               emotions really well)\\n\r\nArt= Rated 9. One of the best art I've seen. It's really bright, and it stands  \\n\r\n         out. I would have rated it 10/10 if it weren't for Hibike! Euphonium.\\n\r\nStory= It could have been 9/10 (I'll talk about weakness in cons), it's really       \\n\r\n            funny sometimes, filled with great strategic twists and insights about   \\n\r\n            life/human nature\\n\\n\r\nCon:\\n\r\nSteph= I have never been bothered by something in a TV show so much as\\n\r\n             this. The way the 3rd protagonist in the anime (not manga) is \\n\r\n             treated just gets me upset for some reason. Although it is shown\\n\r\n             that she is clearly capable of a lot, she is usually only as fan-service   \\n\r\n             , a test subject, or a servant.\\n\r\nStory= Story was great. The only thing is the ending. I'm not complaining\\n\r\n            that the ending was too open, but that it ended on the wrong note.\\n\r\n            If the producers have removed the scene with the elf and her slave, it    \\n\r\n            would have a much better closure, and focus on the next season.\\n\\n\r\nOther notes:\\n\r\nA ton of ecchi/potential hentai material ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\\n\r\nMusic is by video game music creators\\n\r\nA lot of references to different things e.g. (Laputia:Castle in the Sky)\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Watch it. It's really entertaining, and decently memorable. Characters are all pretty interesting and fun. A ton of awesome fan-service going on (I feel as if I'm he only person who likes fan-service :\\). Overall, I give it an 8.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEdit: I literally just noticed that this is categorized as ecchi. This actually surprised me, since most ecchis don't have much plot going on",

            "content": "What an ending, I'm not sure what happened at the end, that challenge declaration of what was summoned, but I've made it so far, and I finally understood what the whole thing was about, races, each one representing a chess pawn, that's very very clever man, too bad this ended up and the story hasn't advanced further, I wish they could hurry up with another season soon! yes, it's that bad to have to wait for another season of something you just got into, but, should you get into it in the first place? let's find out...\r\n- Story (8.7/10):\r\nTalking about the progression of the storyhere, for the whole time, it just sounded like an empty story, just another adventure of heroes who arrived at some world and want to challenge God, That's some Deja-vu mess, but not until the last few minutes of the final episode we got to understand the reason for this games, the meaning of those multiple races, and the route they have to take in order to complete such a task, and man, if only this season was longer and contained that part of the story the score of this would have been higher. It turned up to be just a huge chess game, but boy has it been worth it, there is a lot of development as the story goes by, and there has been a lot of teasing on past events that really gets you hyped up to know more about this strange world.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (9.5/10):\\n\r\nIs there anything else to say here? Like seriously, the most colorful world I've got to see animated, with the red color dominating, might seem a bad idea, but wait until you see the result, the animation was marvelous, character designs are great!!! But hey, It's Madhouse we're talking about, that's nothing strange.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\\n\r\nYes, you heard me, that was a glorious audacious ride, from amazing sound effects to fascinating tracks, the feels and emotions you get to experience from the songs alone, you don't get to experience such a well-composed track in all anime shows, but this one stands on top of many.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (7/10):\\n\r\nHere where it sucked for me at least, besides Shiro and Sora, other character seemed so 2D for me, outstanding treats or interesting vibes around there, the relationship between our sibling heroes that share the name [Blank] was somehow explicit, the wincest was present on a huge scale, I guess considering the two, there was no remarkable character development, but not the same can be said about Steph, she, for the most part, had some character development although it's nothing too remarkable as well, she stood at as a fanservice doll, for the most part, talking about fanservice, this show was a train wreck for this, how is it rated PG again?\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThis is such a one-seat piece of cake, I, however, divided this into 2 days worth-of-watch, I got to know how much this show will be good from the first episode alone, so I decided not to rush through it, and take my time watching and admiring its aspects. I dove in with 0 expectations, I've heard of this show so much in the past, but the art somehow kept me away from it, now that I've finished it, I have no regret but the ordeal of wait, I need a sequel and fast!!!\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (8.5/10):\\n\r\nI tried to be less biased rating this, I feel bad because this show could have been even more enjoyable if it wasn't for the forced fanservice, would I recommend it? well, it depends, are you the type that enjoys a fleshed out story about games set on a magical world? would you mind some fanservice along the ride? well, this is a good show for you.",

            "content": "No game no life is a fantasy isekai anime that starts with a brother and his sister who are masters of games but find real life the worst one of them all,  would they prefer live in a world where games are everything? \r\nwell for starters, as cool and epic as that sound (Which it is) it all can be ruined with the fan service, the bittersweet fan service.\r\npersonally, i wouldn't have a problem with this, sometimes it can be quite enjoyable, like the beach or hot springs episode almost every anime has,but i still find it entertaining, but no game no life exceededthe amount that one can tolerate, its just to much, you can tell from the first episode within the first few seconds when the 11 year old sister is sexualized when she really shouldn't be, and its really unnecessary to the plot of the show.\\n\\n\r\nthe idea, story and concept of this anime were really interesting and fun, it made want to binge watch the whole thing in one sitting, but the fan service really destroyed that completely, normally you can just avoid it, or just brush it off since its not that much,but this. this goes way over the top\\n\\n\r\nto conclude my review on no game no life, i can say the game scenes and afterwards explaining of how well thought out and op the characters were was pretty interesting,but you must set limits and boundaries to some things. i will finish the anime and not drop out because really like the plot, but in my personal life i wouldn't recommend it at all.\\n\\n\r\n end of discussion",

I especially love the cute little Shiro ^^ Honestly though, I don't thing that it couldn't have been done any better.\r\nI hadn't followed this anime when it first aired, but honestly, I find itbetter. I mean, it was impossible to stop once I've started.\\n\r\nThe only problem now, is that it had raised the bar for my expectations in anime, hehehehe.\\n\r\nI really look forward to a second season (if there'll be any XD)",

This anime is unique in the sense that the thought process of the characters is simply brilliant, the closest similarity being \"God's puzzle\".\r\nThe characters areall very different and don't follow your mediocre anime girl or guy patterns, there is an incredible sense of uniqueness in these characters whilst also keeping the old school large breasted ecchi female characters as well as your lolicon types.\\n\\n\r\nThe art received my lowest mark not because it was bad, it was actually excellent, however it just wasn't as amazing as the other elements of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt is an anime that sent me reeling in my chair and unable to stop with amazing climax episodes (6 and 12) that could potentially cause some to orgasm from excitement.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can bother to watch the first two episodes I can guarantee the beautiful humour and genius \"games\" will make it a non stop marathon ending with you begging for a second season.",

            "content": "Just finished this anime, have to say I enjoyed it thoroughly. Haven't seen such a smart and fun anime like this in a while.\r\nI especially love the musical accompaniment. It is absolutely genius! Like in episode 3 when Sora has to stop a coronation ceremony... and what does he do? He stops it by busting in the throne room and starts a CHALLENGE by playing electronic MORTAL KOMBAT music on his phone. Lol. Appropriateness = Godlike right there, as any gamer will testify.\r\nIts not just comic timing either, the soundtrack is genuinely very good. There's alot of nice funky tunes in there. Its upbeat, modern,and of course sometimes a lil sad or mysterious when the scene warrants it.  Its so good I even want to buy it on a CD and listen to it separately. I also spotted alot of tracks that seems to have influences from old school Final Fantasy background music. A fitting tribute for an anime about games hehe.\\n\\n\r\nLoved all the characters in this anime. There's no crazy evil villains out to commit unspeakable evils here (even bandits in this world are nice since they can't commit violence), just a whole lot of cute girls tryin to beat each other in games. Speaking of girls, this anime has probably the smartest way of handling censorship I've ever seen! I mean they have girls going totally naked, and boobs bouncing up and down.... The whole works! But its ok. Through their cleverness, the producers somehow made everything PG-13 family safe. Chk it out yourself to see how they did it. XD\\n\\n\r\nAlso extra points to protagonist Sora, who doesn't mess around and knows what to do right from the start (not a weak and useless crybaby). He's a manly man who knows how to get things done, with the appropriate appreciation for womenz, and none of that fake shyness or over-humbleness that permeates many-a-Japanese protags. Sora also happens to have a very good relationship with his sister Shiro. Now this is how good siblings should be. They back each other up, respect each other's boundaries, joke and have fun play around, and when the going gets tough, they're willing to put their lives on the line for each other. In animes recently, there seems to be a trend in brother/sister relationships where the sister yells abuse at the brother all the time, calls him a pervert and uses violence to smack him down. (Eg Oreimo). The story always implies this kind of abusive behavior as funny or acceptable. Other times they'll be straight up boning each other (Eg KissxSis), which is not good either to say the least... So major kudos to NGNL for showing a healthy and loving brother-sister relationship where they don't commit incest or encourage domestic violence.  \\n\\n\r\nGood music, smart writing, funny jokes and out of nowhere popular references (ARROW TO THE KNEE!) makes this one of the most entertaining anime I've seen this year. I eagerly await the next installment!\\n",

But if you ask me why , I will tell you why : because it have one Original story which holds you till the end . In the start the art seemed strange for one anime about game but during the story it made sense of colors and shapes are that way because usually gets so used to a standard image (animation) but then becomes really \"good\" . About the sound I like it so much because it fits perfectly each situation since comicsscenes till the action . About the character I looked all character have your personality well-defined and explicit along the story . About the enjoyment I give 10 because even in action scenes you can have a good laugh and the action of some characters come to be unusual  . Finishing i really like this anime and think is a good option who wants some action , funny and some pervert things in one location and well-devolped not allowing some cliches screw up it.",

Some may shy away from this show thinking \"Another show about video games?\" but this show differs in the fact that they aren't inside a game playing the game, they are in an alternate world playing games. What's the difference? They aren't trapped, in fact they quite enjoy the fact that they're stuck there. What I love about this anime the most is its genius strategies, very much akin to Death Note. Never before have I been so caught up in a game of rock paper scissors and I wasn'teven the one playing it (watch and see). The next best thing I love about it is the art. Very colorful and pastel, but what makes this one unique is the red outlines of the character and the light, omnipresent haze. I also love it for its harem quality. Yes, it's another harem and the characters pretty much know it's becoming a harem but it has some semblance of originality when it comes to how he goes about meeting these girls. The characters are all very cute and quite memorable, especially the sister. Another great quality about this anime is that it has a clear goal and that it has its suspenseful, hopeless moments and then it turns around and all I can think is GENIUS! This anime is sure to continue and I certainly look forward to the second season, this show is far from done.",

            "content": "TL;DR- Show is good, look at the ranking/ratings. Lots of blind love and hate for being popular, some hate justified over the excessive Ecchi fanservice involving Loli's, but overall a great show. Read on if you want to know how it stacks up in full.\r\nArt-10:\r\nLet's start with what you'll notice first, this beautiful art. While some might not like it (initially I didn't), I found it grew on me and really highlights the shows fantasy aspect. Character design is quite refreshing to me despite the generic 2 body types (Busty or Loli), I really like the use of vibrant colors with Jibril they do suchan amazing job of the innocent to evil transition that every time it makes me smile. Animation wise this is Madhouse and they don't disappoint, if you hate CG you might find this annoying but they really did such an amazing job particularly with the games. All in all this art ranks up in the best of the best to me.\\n\\n\r\nStory-10:\\n\r\nWhere to start, you should know the basics, two super genius gamers get summoned to another world. I won't spoil the specifics of why (you'll find out quickly), but it really is refreshing compared to the normal reason heroes from another world get summoned. The rules of the world are also of particular note, making all conflicts resolved through games, and forbidding more or less most forms of crime.  With all this setup I really thought NGNL wouldn't be able to keep up with its premise but honestly they do a great job keeping the world developing into this amazing place as we learn more about it. The games are fantastic, and keep trying to 1-up each other to the point where I really feel they'll have to run out of something more amazing to play eventually. All in all the story of NGNL is intriguing, to the point where I went to read all of the LN that has been translated, which gets a 10/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10:\\n\r\nOften overlooked but the sound design of this show is AMAZING! Not joking probably the best in recent memory. They do such a good job of blending the scenes and sound together to make everything more memorable. I haven't yet got the OST to play yet but the music is extremely fitting and all the effects are spot on. I'm not a native speaker so I can't really comment on the VA but they all do a great job for me. The opening and ending songs are both great (though the OP is the standout), but just the song alone wouldn't make the intro so amazing, instead its the visuals and how it fits in when they play it (they have the usual clip before the OP). It always manages to fit in and never feels jarring like hearing Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei's OP start up in a way that just ruins the mood (I like the song don't get me wrong but when it plays it doesn't transition smoothly).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9:\\n\r\nHonestly this is gonna be hit or miss with most. Personally I love them all, I think that they decided to abandon Steph, as they were setting her up to be developed out of a comic relief character but ended up deciding they wanted to keep here there sadly. Jibril is of course my favorite if you couldn't tell, a God-Slaying angelic scholar...seriously how am I to resist. She's also quite the two face being both angelic and demonic in equal measures. The main leads are a mixed bag, while I like Shiro and think she's quite fun, no real development of her other than portraying off her skills has been done. Sora on the other hand has the most amazing moment when he shows his true character late in the season, show just who he really is and managing to prove that genius and insanity run hand in hand for sure. Overall docking this section for the poor use of Steph and Shiro's lack of development or growth but even while I say this they're still top notch character compared to most shows.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10: \\n\r\nI've watched each episode twice, once by myself and once with my wife. I've also read the LN and am going through them a second time as we speak. The world here is vast and intriguing and the plot is equal measures serious and comedy. The only thing that could dampen your enjoyment of this show is a distaste of Ecchi and fanservice (including Lolicons) which this show has in spades (toned down from the LN). The fact that this show is nearly in the top 20 anime of all time while being Ecchi is a massive testament to how enjoyable it is, as ecchi shows have a rough rode since a fair amount are put off by it (particularly the loli girls). This show however unlike the many others does not fall pray to the fanservice first and instead uses it as juxtaposition to snap you from being serious after a game back into the more comedic atmosphere. While I won't deny the show could certainly be argued to stand on its own without the fanservice it would be a massive departure from the LN to remove it completely and I for one enjoyed how they handled it.",

There are 16 races and 10 rules that must be followed, and this story follows these two characters as they try to challenge god in a game.\r\nArt 9/10\r\nWhether you like the art or not depends entirely on you. This isn't just amazing art that's plain to see like Fate Zero or Shingeki no Kyojin. Instead, the art style is very vibrant and has acolorful tone. At first, the strange color palette was weird for me to get adjusted to like it was an oversaturated photoshop project, but it really grew on me and also helps give the vibe that this is another world.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound is pretty solid, voice acting is pretty good and music is fine, but nothing really extraordinary\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very interesting and likable for the most part.

But one shouldn't deny the fact that it is by far one of the most enjoyable anime out there. The story is not meant to create any drama or suspense, but rather let audiences sit back, relax, and watch an anime that doesn't require them to shut their brains off. \r\nThe art is beautiful and fits the atmosphere, the soundtrack is fairly decent, and there is never a dullmoment. \\n\\n\r\nPeople should stop giving low score just because there is too much fan service or a certain aspect of the show doesn't meet their requirement. This show does well what it is made for. 8/10",

            "content": "PHYSICS! \r\nPHYSICS!!\r\nSCIENCE!!! Oh Physics is in that category? Yes!\r\nMATH!\r\nMATH!!\r\nNumbers!\r\nSuper Absurd Intelligence!\r\nSuper Duper Cute Smart LOLI and to metion a NEET!\r\nI apologize for the hate of those exclamation marks ;p\r\nNormally some other people would at least try to avoid those subjects at school. I forgot to mention, some kids who hated numbers would rather go more literary subjects.\r\nNo Game No Life did break that for you. Who would have thought that this show and especially the main characters make this super interesting and exciting in each episode? You will never be disappointed at all and even beg for the next episode to come out alreadyafter the other. Some other game animes totally have surpassed the others, which is this anime of course from my own opinion.\\n\\n\r\nNo Game No Life is one of the best seasons this year and I'm sure of that. If anyone says that this show is not that great, he/she must be missing something awesome once in a while. By the way, this show is beyond awesome or bad@ss! I call this a rare gem in the anime history, you might have a different one, but this is one for me.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNo Game No Life is all about two NEETs and legendary gamers back in their world. In the real world which is around in Tokyo. They are known as Blank or Kohaku for not having defeated by anyone in their record. They are impossible to defeat and some people have even tried to defeat this pair, which they undoubtedly lost in the game. No one knows about their identities in real life. They are actually outcast in the society as they have experienced depressing things in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nSora, he\u2019s an 18 years old guy, the oldest of the two, and Shiro, the 11 years old LOLI who has massive of intelligence, above par than Sora. These two have encountered match between Tet, a God in a parallel world, as soon as they have defeated him. Sora and Shiro are summoned or transported to a world, which is ruled everything by games. No one would have ever thought these total two strangers in that world would be the saviors of Humanity or as they call it Imanity in that world. They are 16 races and Imanity is the lowest races since they are weak to the other races. They are defenseless and vulnerable. Some other races use magical powers, or great intelligence, while the others have strong senses than the others.\\n\\n\r\nThis is similar to the other animes out there like Sword Art Online and BTOOOM. They try to finish the end of the game to escape and go back to their normal lives. No Game No Life is different since the two main characters prefer to live in a world that is totally far from real life. Back in their world they are nobody and they are seen as weird. But the world they are invited in, these two are like celebrities that attempt to get at the top. The truth is, Sora and Shiro go to extremes to enjoy each game. Game is their life. \\n\\n\r\nWhy? The development of each episode is very well thought. The 10 pledges are explained thoroughly that must be followed like the 10 Commandments in the Bible. Each episode also leaves the viewer for wanting more. Every match doesn\u2019t look or seem dull, but exciting and you won\u2019t even believe the gazillion plot twists in every match they are in. I promise, the storyline is really good! Even some principles of Physics are used in this anime. Some funny and good reference is included that I would never think that they will use. What else are you looking for, two total geniuses, LOLI! I\u2019m sorry for loving lolis ==\u2019, a pervert and funny oni-chan that has weakness over animal ear girls, a dim-witted Dola-chan, and a weirdo Flugel and that is Jibril to complete the good recipe of the storyline. The serious amount of time that they have spent and creativity is endless. The pure bad@ss moments and pure awesomeness will amaze you in each episode and even at the end of the anime, leaving you for begging more. Here, hoping for the next season already by next week or even nexth month.\\n\\n\r\nThe very well thought episode will leave the viewers in awe. There are some episode that are less exciting sometimes, but they do not fall from lower than good, it manages to be always far decent for most of the episodes. Now, I demand for the second season ! !\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t just the above anime art you will ever see. This is just totally awesome and I like the radiant colours that they use for this anime. We always see the standard black lines and here we will see the unique red lines. Shaft does this also, but I say MADHOUSE art beats Shafts this time. The vivid colours that are used give the surroundings to look more a fantasy look. Even in the darkest places they\u2019ve showed looks wonderful in the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music in each scene is suitable. I don\u2019t really notice the background music in some scenes or I rather ignore them. Even the Openings and Endings in some other animes sometimes would rather to skip them and jump over to the main part. But the Opening and the Ending of this anime, I never even skip one of them LOL!\\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs that I ignore much, I liked them in this anime, especially when Shiro and Sora revealed why they win that match and explained it to their opponent. I can\u2019t help but smile along their victory xD. The voices are also superb and fit every character in the anime.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fun to watch and hard to decide who you will be bias of. Since each character is lovable and Shiro\u2019s virgin jokes to Sora are just fucking hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nI love the personalities of each character. Sora\u2019s deceitful tactics towards Dola are darn funny. Seeing Sora\u2019s appearance, you wouldn\u2019t think he\u2019s such a badass character at all until you watch the anime. Shiro the moe filled; her personality is rather interesting in my opinion. It\u2019s rare to find an 11 year old girl with a good sense of humour, and is rather mature than her older brother.  \\n\r\nKurami\u2019s tough appearance kinda surprises me that she\u2019s kind of a cry baby. I find Izuna-tan very cute along with Shiro, another moe filled again ;p. And the Shrine Priestess the new character never thought to have a cute character in that holy sexy appearance ! ! I want to see more of her xD. Geez, she appeared in the very last episode fuck that. I feel like I\u2019m Sora at this moment xD. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYes, I\u2019ve enjoyed this anime and I\u2019m not disappointed every week. Every episode is just fucking all worth of waiting. I hate waiting for new episode every week, I tend to wait for months and watch them in one go. But No Game No Life kept me starved for more. The cliffhanger that they posed kind of frustrated me, but the wait was all worth it when the new episode was out. The ideas that they used in this one was really exciting and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall! Briliant! I've never scored an this perfect! Unfortunately, the show just ended and next week wouldn\u2019t be as exciting like before. Anyways, I recommend this anime to be added to your list it\u2019s totally freaking worth it. I\u2019m wishing that the next season will be on its way to be released already T^T.",

            "content": "Please allow me to share my view on No Game No Life (NGNL). Forgive me if there is any grammatical errors or some of the terms wasn't used correctly.\r\nEven though NGNL has a genre of Adventure, Fantasy and Supernatural, we shouldn't watch it in a much serious tone due to the addition of Ecchi and Comedy genre to it. While the story lacks in originality, *coughs* Mondaiji-tachi, Sword Art Online etc, the execution of the story is far superior than most of the anime with similiar storyline and plot. With fan-service throughout NGNL, to me it was a good addition although it may be alittle unnecessary at times. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is definite a + point to NGNL, which is very, very eye-pleasing. The character design is top notch. The bright colours definitely stood out and showed the fantasy settings pretty well. It definitely sucks your eye onto the screen for a whole 23 minutes every episode.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the OP and ED are awesome. I can listen to both of the songs every episode without skipping it, which is very rare to me. What really stood out was the background music used. They were used at the right time and definitely succeeded in creating the atmosphere, especially during the battles.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a downside to NGNL, it would be the characters. Both the protagonists, Sora and Shiro lacked of development and depth. While both of them have different personalities, it wasn't explained much in the series. However, what can you actually expect from a 12 episodes series? Any 12-episode series that tried hard to be perfect in every aspect will just fail miserably. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime series very much. In fact, I stayed up late just to wait for the episodes to be released every week. Personally, I believe that we can enjoy any anime series that is interesting to us. It does not need to be perfect as in *the story must be original, art must be good, character development must be good and the list goes on*. What's the point if there is an anime that is perfect in every aspect but you just can't seem to enjoy it at the end? \\n\\n\r\nNo Game No Life is definitely one of the must watch anime series of 2014. Heck who say's that only serious, dark or tear-shredding anime can be the top anime in MAL. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the scores, I gave,\\n\r\nStory         - 8\\n\r\nArt            - 10\\n\r\nSound       - 9\\n\r\nCharacter  - 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall      - 9 \\n\\n",

            "content": "Games make you stupid they say. Games harm they say. I say that \"they\" would change their mind after watching this anime. An anime that increases your IQ by at least 10%. Today's review, a short and unfinished (waiting for season 2) anime on the title \"No Game No Life\".\r\nPlot and Story Line\r\nFirst thing I want to tell you about NGNL is how I've watched it. I stopped after four episodes because, I don't know, it wasn't that special. Luckily I don't give up that easily and after I started again and finished the fifth episode, well I couldn't stop. Although it was the firstday of school the next day, I had to finish it., and yeah. I went to sleep at about 2:00 AM. But definitely worth it. The story is awesome, catchy and one of the most interesting storylines I've ever seen. \\n\r\nNow, the story is basically about two need siblings, Sora, the older brother and Shiro his little sister. They escape their usual life trough the huge world of Games. They play all kinds of games, card games, board games, video games...And most importantly they always win as the couple known as \"Blank\". One day they get an invitation to a chess game, and as expected they win. Soon after they are transported to another world by Ted, the god of Games. In that new world everything is decided by, guess what, of course, games. Whether it's about a coin or a war between countries, games decide the outcome. Just a right place for the siblings that really aim their goals very high: their final goal, defeat Ted and become the new Gods of Games. But will they succeed or not? We don't know because the first season finished half-way and we are still waiting for season two to air. The makers are sure keeping us on tenterhooks. \\n\r\nFirst thing that has to be mentioned as a part of the whole plot is the sibling relationship. Forget all sibling relationships that you saw before because this one will top them all. It is not a sad story, nor did they have a hard childhood. It's just so funny and cute. I mean they are so used to each other that they can't even be one minute away from each other. Just KAWAII. They would probably be nothing without each other. It's like they fill up the emptiness of the other one. They would be nothing without each other. \\n\r\nBut now the thing that really makes the whole anime so special. The intellect, the strategies, the plans and brilliance are incomparable with any other anime (well maybe code geass). Both of them Shiro and Sora are masterminds in their own class. Working as Blank together they are invincible. Every strategy and plan, and every single move is being explained in details. That's the thing I was talking about in the beginning that increases your IQ.It is sooooo interesting to listen to their explanations and make everytime :\"Ooooh, that's what he did\" in the end. Sooo amusing, I promise you that. \\n\r\nWhen it comes to the storyline it really has no flaws at all. No plot holes, no stupid twists and it keeps your attention till the end. In short, please release the second season! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis dude is so damn funny. Although SORA is a little pervert I liked him. He is a typical NEET yet brilliant when it comes to strategy and plans. He is very communicative and outgoing, and energic. He has that sudden reactions and emotion-breakouts that make him so interesting. Yet, the most important reason I liked Sora is how he takes care for his little sister. Too cute!\\n\\n\r\nThis girl looks like an emotionless doll, or more a very intelligent robot. SHIRO does not show that much feelings but damn she is smart. She is so good at numbers and and logical problems making her solve almost everything. It was so hilarious to see how her brother-complex awakens when Sora talks with other girls. Jealousy was always a funny thing. Kawaii, little genius. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style \\n\r\nNow this is definitely something different. The animation of NGNL fit perfectly with its story. The style, the colors, the brightness...It was just perfect. And the character design, epic. I mean, the characters just look like they should. It's like their personalities were pictured in human form. I hope you get me. :D You probably open some pictures before you go and watch an anime, here is one screen-shot of Disboard  for you...\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nNo Game No Life is not an actual action anime. So if you want a lot of action this is not for you. But I promise you, it's worth every single second because it's so interesting and catchy. I love anime where the main characters are masterminds that entertain you using only their cleverness and wittiness. That's why I love NGNL. It's not one of my favorites but, in my opinion, definitely deserves a rating of, let's say 8,46. \\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

But No Game No Life, to my surprise, was very entertaining and completely exceeded my expectations.\r\nAs a former gamer, it was actually intriguing to find that the main characters were highly skilled sibling gamers classified as being urban legends themselves. Their skills and strategies along with the strong relationship both possess is a strong factor this anime have. Those characteristics plays an interesting role in the parallel world they were transported to. Allconflicts were to be resolved through the rules of games, exactly fitting for the duo gamer. Let's just say that the smart strategies involved in these games were amazingly put together to create tense sessions of game between opposing sides. And who are the ones who faced off against the sibling? I have to say I found the girls to be really fun to watch, even when a couple felt tropey. The backstories was a welcome addition that adds depth, and the intelligence some have made for great matches between them and the sibling gamers. Also, another surprise was that the comedy, fueled by fanservices, wasn't actually as irritating as I thought it would be and instead succeeded at making me laugh. This'll be different for some of us, but I'd say it's due to the excellent nature of the characters that the comedy connected well like a puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nFocusing at an aspect I found to be awesome was the art. I was totally off guarded by it. The parallel world is vibrant, tinted by a lively set of warm colors that suits the fantasy genre. It removed boringness and instead embodied the word 'beautiful'. Entrancing in my eyes is a good way to describe the world. Of course, the animation added the last boost for me to give art a perfect score. The smooth animation gave life to the world and bright energy for the actions. I also have to mention at the solid efforts for the sounds. While the OSTs and SFX was great and all, the voice acting stood out for me as it captures the personality of the characters. I enjoyed the characters even more because of the emotions and expressiveness contained within the voices.\\n\\n\r\nNo Game No Life was an enthralling anime of games. A vivid world where the sibling apply their skills of gaming to win conflicts is a premise I find to be entertaining. Especially with the funny and fascinating side characters, the anime worked greatly as a comedic enjoyment with compelling battles of who can outwit their opponents the best.",

            "content": "This show is wild. It sets up a wonderfully interesting world controlled by a fun mischievous god who wants someone to challenge him in a game of chess. Isekai antics ensue. When telling me to watch no game no life my friend told me that it isnt THAT generic of an isekai and he was both wrong and right. It isnt generic in the sense that the harem isnt in love with him, and he isnt overthrowing some demon lord. The show is fun as well, and you can get some enjoyment out of it. Along with this the show is very good looking andthe OP is a bop and a half. But thats where my praise has to end. \\n\r\nThe plot armor in this show is BEYOND enormous, this combined with the fact that the rules are set up and nothing is done with them (the rule on cheating specifically felt like it was only set up so we could see that our protagonists were edgy kiddos who cheat to win and can get away with it). The flimsy world building is complimented by a healthy amount of waifu eye candy (I like the angel girl best).\\n\r\n My biggest gripe with the show comes down to the last episode. We all know the protagonists are going to win, so the final twist isnt really that much, but they take what could be a wonderful and possible touching moment of character and turn it into another \"Oh hey look at how overpowered our protagonists are they planned SOOOOOO far ahead hahahaha buymymerch\" moment.\\n\r\nOther than this as well as some other moments in the last episode, the series isnt particularly offensive, and im upset that it was cancelled as im sure it could have some potential, the last few moments give us a glimpse of this. But with what we have, this is the score I have to give it.",

            "content": "Another over-thought, attempt at being clever anime that completely misses the mark. \r\n- On our first introduction to the characters; a 15 year old dead-beat and his 11 year old 'genius' sister is ruined by a G*ddamn panty shot. I nearly stopped watching there, but decided it was stupid to judge the anime on one bad choice. \r\n-The duo is known as \"Blank\" in the online world, and after being whisked away to a parallel world, begin the process of overthrowing the government(s) by playing games -> which is the way all issues are settled in this world. \r\nI like the premise of a worldwhere all disputes are resolved by games, it could have been interesting. Instead it falls flat on its brothers c*ck. Oh wait, that was the 11 year old sleeping on her brothers crotch. Nevermind. \\n\\n\r\n-The wholes series tries to shoe-horn in how unbelievably skilled these two are, if it succeeded at anything, it was how unbelievable it actually is. The convoluted methods the characters go through to justify how they win makes me think the writers sat in a room for days planning this out, giggling at how terribly clever they are. No. The more the characters talked about strategy and how they won, the more obvious it became that the writers really weren't clever. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is less about games than it is about a harem though. Of course this loser 15 year old NEET just happens to stumble upon the most gorgeous women in all the land and of course they all love him and want to do him - his sister included. Its tiring and boring. This is probably how \"Nice Guys\" view the world. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fine. Its modern and had a little same-face going on, but the costume designs range from interesting to \"did you even try?\" Bad girls have tits, good girls kinda do. Blah blah blah. Harem anime. I'm too gay to care about this shit. \\n\\n\r\nThe best thing I can say about this anime is that I love the opening. The anime has the substance of deep-space, but at least the opening has a decent beat going on. \\n\\n\r\nPeople I think will like this anime: People who hate themselves, masochists, Nice Guys, Perverts and people who don't know what \"taste\" really is. \\n\\n\r\nPeople who will hate this: People who've seen the best anime has to offer. Spare yourself this BS anime series and go watch FMA:B or a Miyazaki movie. Any of them.",

This is actually a VERY good example of a good and innovative echhi anime. And by innovative I mean that it can actually go 5 minutes without a upskirt or boob flash. Actually now that I think about it it's not character and story driven rather than go to the brim of \"damn near porn\". The characters rebound perfectly from each other and just aren't some stupid floozys or brainless perverts. I think the story is well done and it compliments the art style perfectly.The settings and premise make sense and the characters aren't some carbon copies of someone else and actually have personalities of there own. Nothing feels forced or contrived, and you know what... the only problem I have is what I stated in the beginning, if there was a conclusion to the story I would be happy. Alas it may never be.

            "content": "\"There's no way to know the rules or the goal, yet there are 7 Billion players making whatever moves they want. If you loose too much or win too much, there are penalties. You can't pass your turn, and if you talk to much, you'll be ostracized. There are no parameters and no way to even know the genre. This world... is just a crappy game.\"\r\nOnce again, anime has made me question my existence on this earth... The more anime I've watched and loved, I have found myself asking the same question over and over again, \"Why was I born into the wrong world?\". I'msure there have been quite a few of us that have asked the same question. For the Fairy Tail lovers, you all wish that you could be a Wizard in Fiore. For the Naruto lovers, you wish to be a Ninja and learn all kinds of Jutsu. For the Pokemon lovers, you wish to have the opportunity to catch them all, only in real life and not just in a game. My point that I'm trying to make: this world is boring.\\n\\n\r\nNot only anime does this though. For years, gaming, television, and books have been building up people's expectations for what reality should be like, and when those people realize the horrible truth, we resort to watching/playing/reading more and more about the worlds we wish to live in. It's a saddening truth, but we have to live with it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'd like to welcome you to an anime about 2 people who, like us, feel like they were born into the wrong world, and get their opportunity to escape into a world 1000x better than ours. Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you, my review, on No Game No Life.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSora and Shiro are two siblings living the life of your ordinary NEET. Only, they aren't really average at all. They play games, yes, but they are literally unbeatable. No one knows anything about them and the lives they lead. The only thing everybody knows about them is that they always leave their usernames blank. Despite their skills in any game imaginable, they are bored of the world they live in. That's when they get the opportunity from a so called \"God\" named Tet to be reborn into a world where everything is decided by games. Follow 10 simple rules, and you can prosper. Follow these siblings as they try to reach their goal and beat the God of this new world, but it's gonna take some time, effort, and a whole lot of planning, but I'm sure they can pull it off. After all, they are Blank.\\n\\n\r\nThe story piqued my interest from the very beginning, and with every twist, turn, and the jaw dropping season finale, I really hope to Tet that Madhouse Studios doesn't pass up the opportunity to continue this series.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSpeaking of Madhouse Studios, they've been known for some pretty big work, such as the infamous Death Note, Black Lagoon series, and Chobits. However, it's been a while since I've seen anything they've come up with that deserves a lot of hype. No Game No Life is their golden ticket. Some of the most insane yet beautiful artwork I've seen in a long time. The view of every single part of the world was amazing. It was colorful, beautiful, detailed, just brilliant. And the character designs were all good. Now, let's hear 3 cheers for the return of drawing characters with triangle mouths! \\(o^o)/\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIf they ever come up with an English dub for this anime (I really hope they don't personally), they better get one hell of a cast, because I'm pretty sure that all the Japanese dub actors and actresses made the characters sound as good as they possibly can. They put so much realism into their acting that it was probably one of my favorite casts up to date. And then there's the soundtrack, and holy mother of Tet was it good. The opening is probably my favorite song off of the entire anime soundtrack. I never skip it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSora VS Light Yagami. Sora VS Lelouch. Sora VS Keima Kasuragi. All of these are interesting match-ups, and the thing is, I have no idea who would win in any of those fights. The thing they all have in common? They're all geniuses. Sora is intelligent, funny, highly relateable to when it comes to women... at least in my case. He's one of my favorite MCs in all of anime. Shiro IS my favorite MC. It was a tough fight between her and Kirino... but Shiro has her beat.  Same qualities as Sora, only I'm pretty sure she's less curious about boobs than Sora is. She's also on the quiet side, so that gives her a little bit more of a mystery to her personality. Then we got a bunch of other characters, such as Steph, Jibril, Izuna, etc. They all had their good traits to them. I didn't dislike any of them in particular. There were a few moments where I thought they were jerks, but it all kind of evened out in the end. Good set of characters overall...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed NGNL. I really did. I'm upset that I have to wait for a second season that might not even come. This anime had good humor, great animations, a kickin' soundtrack, fun characters, and a plot that made you think about a whole lot. Oh, and there was the story as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, NGNL is worth the hype it's been getting. A lot of people might not think so, but in my personal opinion, this should be a must-watch for all anime fans.",

            "content": "Hey there! First things first, this is my first review and i\u2019m not a english speaker. This review contains my humble opinion and SPOILERS, hope you like it and if you have different point of view i would like very much to discuss it \r\nThe story\r\nOne day two siblings who happen to be a urban legends in the internet with the name Blank (literally [  ]) are invited to a simple game of chess by a boy, who happen to be a God from a fantasy world. After the game that was simply to acknowledge their capacities they are transferred to his world. Aworld where \"everything is decided by games\", there is no war and no violence only games.\\n\r\nThese two siblings have never had lost a game and do not have that intention as after a little while living in this world they decided to stay and a little forder even help Imanity (humanity) to have the right to challenge the one that put them in this world with their talents. \\n\r\nI remember the first time that i read the title and think this would be another anime that did what it suggests: \u2018\u2019if the characters die in the game they die in real life\u2019\u2019. It wasn\u2019t and i\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t go that way. It still was that game anime type formula where the characters that incredibly good at what they do and have to face a various number of challenges each one more difficult and with more importance than the other that will change something in the future. \\n\r\nSo it\u2019s a simple but interesting plot, but what makes No Game No Life different is that the main characters embrace this new world and even try to rule it and where in others you find difficulties and parts where you doubt the heroes (even though you don\u2019t want to) are going to lose here you just know that Sora and Shiro, the main characters, had already everything and i mean every little thing planned and there is no chance they will lose. And this is what i think it can change your opinion about the whole anime, either you are okay with seeing no problems (at least almost none) and hard time to the siblings and focus your attention to how they do it or either you will probably dislike this entire show. It has to be about you and your taste i guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\\n\r\nSora and Shiro are not surprisingly NEET and hikikomori gamers with poor social social life, until here nothing really new unless the fact that they are siblings. Let\u2019s face it if this two were actually real life people they would be miserable. This thing of romanticized lonely people is not cool. Even though both are known for being both the main characters i got the feeling since the beginning of the show that Sora is the most important character, he gets more screen time, more monologues and play as the voice of both. But he wouldn't go anywhere without his beloved younger stepsister, literally as away from her hebecomer \u2018\u2019 a spineless, cowardly wreck, and only returns to his former self if he is able to see her\u2019\u2019. Sora is extroverted, observer and a bit pervert. Not that unusual. Shiro is quite, cute and more intelligent in logical problems, at first i thought she would be a little annoying but i was wrong and i ended up liking her character very much and i wish she was/will have a little more of devolvement. They both work perfectly and if Shiro wasn\u2019t there it would be a lot more boring. \\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters there is a bit to say, and the first one that comes in my mind is Steph. I really like her role in the story as granddaughter of the latest Imanity\u2019s king. She\u2019s emocional, naive and not as intelligent as Sora and Shiro or any other supporting character to be honest but she is smart. Steph is the dummy character that is needed for the viewers to understand and to catch up with all the games that are played in the show which for me was really useful to be honest. But a problem in her character and in Jibril\u2019s too (all right most of the female characters) is that because of all the fanservice they lose a lot of point and presence. The name of the anime is since it came out knowing by how much fanservice it has is which i think it\u2019s bad \u2018cause starting to watch it only for the fanservice takes a little of integrity of the anime story and anime itself. Don\u2019t take me wrong i really liked to see Steph in glasses, Jibril it\u2019s a powerful angel for god sake and i don\u2019t wanna talk about that fox lady from the last episode but the moment that fanservice start to overcome the character trades like it does in NGNL is a little too much especially if they are this important and powerful. \\n\r\nOther characters that i found interesting but weren\u2019t that developed were Chlammy and Feel. They appeared a good quantity of time and yet it feels like they were just another character for Sora and Shiro sudden benefic. \\n\\n\r\nArt and soundtrack:\\n\r\nI will be 100% honest here the thing that actually put me in watching this anime was the art. I had never watched an anime like this and added with fantasy was an amazing thing. It\u2019s colorful and fun just like a world about game sound be. I mean if it was dark why would you wanted to run it? Look at those the backgrounds, they are all about fantasy and games (exactly what this show it\u2019s supposed to be about).  I will search for the people who made this kind of artwork in the future.\\n\r\nFor sound track i got a positive opinion as well. I don\u2019t think the soundtrack stood out as the art style, i don\u2019t think it has a memorable specific song that you will want to heard on it\u2019s own. Unless we are talking about the opening song that one it\u2019s amazing specially the piano intro, i got this feeling of adventure and excitement just for hearing it. I had to putting on my phone i just really like it a lot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall:\\n\r\nThere are a few reasons i can\u2019t got a higher score (again a huge one is the fanservice) but the main one was that sometimes i simply got bored, the games weren\u2019t challenging and i like to know how they do it but if there is no difficulties there is kind of no point. I don\u2019t understand people who say this anime will change all the game-type animes. It has new things yes but it\u2019s not good enough for that, at least to me it\u2019s a bit far from that. I only started to get a little more attached to the anime maybe in the last 3 episodes. Only after i watch them i change the score. It felt like it dragged a little to make the viewers wait for something really big that didn\u2019t happen. They left the story hanged which it would be good if i knew there was going to be a second season. If there is i\u2019m really hoping it will get better, a lot better. There is so much potential in this show it\u2019s a little disappointing if they just keep it like this. I wouldn't just drop it but i wouldn't be excited to watch it.",

I still watched it to see what was going to happen, but sadly I ended up being confused and saying \"WTH is this bull honky.\" The reason is that the story would get me mixed up, it jumped around so much. Sure I understood the siblings goal (they made that clear from the get-go) and that the developers were trying to explain everything (the races, the world, how everything worked, etc.) to the viewers so they theywould understand this world, but it all happened in a mishmash of episodes. In other words, it was all over the place. I may just have been me, but I had to go back and re-watch so many times to figure out what was going on. Sometimes it wasn't clear what the siblings plan were in an episode and how it made any sense in this game world. Nevertheless, this anime is a good watch and I hope they have a second season so that they can explain what in the heck is going on. Also, they could lay off the red tint or whatever they used because it looks odd. Yeah, it's suppose to look like a video game but it makes everything look weirdly colored. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, weird but good story, beautiful music, oddly colored red tinted art but a pleasant watch.",

Character development is amazing, Art is fantastic, and the plot is one that can keep you hooked until you've finished the anime. Especially when you see the ending to this amazing anime, it'll make you want to see a second season! *Lets hope for a second season*\r\nSTORY 10/10\r\nThe plot is really unique to the anime, since it was unique it pulled the viewer in immediately. The to protagonists Sora, and Shiro are brought into another world; not just any word but a gaming world.The main objective is to vs 'God' which is also a gamer too. How will Sora and Shiro get to vs 'God' then watch the anime. The strategy involved in the anime is outstanding as well, you will sit there astonished at how strategic each game is and what will awh you even more is that someone took the time to think out each strategy and move. Finally, sure there is a little bits of Harem and ecchi here and there but it doesn't effect the overall feel of the anime, if anything it makes it more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nART 10/10\\n\r\nThe Art in the anime is very spot on, it has a lot of bright colors that all mesh together bringing forth a very colorful anime. All the colors, designs, background detail are all amazing and fully represent this anime for what it brings to the table.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 10/10\\n\r\nThe intro to the anime is outstanding! It is very catchy and it would make the viewer want to get the full song because of how good it is. The Outro is like wise. The times as to when they put in the sounds that would fit the scene is spot on. When you expect a sound/soundtrack to be played then and now is there.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 10/10\\n\r\nEach character has their defining moment that makes them who they are. Each character plays a role that made this anime worth wild, each of them were there to help out strategically as well; so none of the characters were pointless they all played the part.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10/10\\n\r\nI found this very enjoyable because I love the strategy in the anime, I love each character for the part they played and I loved how there is an objective they need to achieve to win it all. I Especially like the voice acting they were all spot on to the character for example *Spoiler* Sora is played by Kirito's voice actor. That made it very enjoyable for me to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is deserving of it's spot at Top 50 animes. It is also deserving for a second season! I liked it a lot, and I think you'll like it too.\\n\\n\r\nNGNL MUST WATCH! DO YOU EVEN SECOND SEASON BRO?",

The whole point of this show is that the whole world is a game, nothing just happens, it all is a set of factors that causes something to happen, and with knowledge of these factors, it can be changed.\r\nSo the show is set in a world where everything is decided through games, thosegames apply to strict rules and such, and you can see how smartly the protags use these rules.\\n\r\nAside from that, the show is mildly entertaining, full of dubstep, and is just not in my taste. 2modern4me. Maybe 14 year old club kidz will like it more.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a fun show, if you take it too seriously you will probably hate it, but that's just the way it is, and it's very enjoyable all the way through. Perhaps concluding the story in one season is impossible but still kind of annoying that it ends so abruptly and you don't really feel closure, and i guess it's lacking any kind of depth really, i mean if you'd want to you can shove an uterior 2deep4u meaning in the most animes out there now.",

If you want an anime that is just fun , an anime that will make you laugh with witty unpredictable moments and face palming stupidly( anyone who don\u2019t agree ,what was you reaction when he decided he would fight the war beasts )then this Is a show for you . and if not ,are you're allergic to fun happiness and joy? then go watch helsing ultimate in that case its good show without those . The plot was just something that I just love the idea of. A world ruled by games and has a clear set of rules. It such a good concept . not to mentions humans are the underdogs in this and everyone love the underdog. But the anime would be nothing without the characters. Sora and shiro step brother and sister , they both have social disorders both are geniuses in there own way, sora can read people  so well that he can anticipate their reactions in any situation (essentially he know what your planning before you do ) , shiro can learn vast amount of information and able to decide what is the best course of action (shes a computer) together they are unbeatable . and as such they don\u2019t take any situation seriously. and when they are betting the human race that something that some people might take seriously. but they just don\u2019t care because their so confident their going to win, in any situation even in a game of chance like paper scissor\u2019s rock. how can you be so  confident in a game of chance you might ask,  well that\u2019s easy add a little  PHYSIOLOGICAL WARFARE IN TO THE MIX aka psych them out (I like my words better). They always  find a creative way of wining.  The remaining cast are a female bumbling sidekick a female powerful fugle (race also known as god killers ) who was a bright loving  ex mass murderer back in the days before tet , a female human and elf who are best friends (maybe a little closer I don\u2019t know )who that believe that shiro and sora are going to get humanity killed  . you might have noticed the lack of men then you might notice if you watch the show the increasing number of scenes that take place in the group bath. These characters aren't just their for fan service but , they are interesting and entertaining characters, the fact that they take their clothes off more than a stripper doesn't change that . (not NSFW though) the animation is  bright which fits a world where no violence stealing or murders exist and it sound though nothing stands out in my mind is still as good as most anime .\\n\\n\r\n if your thinking about watching this show i would highly recommend . which i've only said about 4 other anime. trust me on this you wont regret it 9/10",

            "content": "Well this is my first review, so I hope that I won't look stupid writting my thoughts here \r\nI actually don't get people who are saying that this show is s**t. Well first of all I think that watching anime should bring enjoyment to people. This show may be overrated right now, but I don't consider this anime anywhere near bad, I mean it should totally be in a top 50 at least. I may not be an expert on anime like some people are, but when some anime with alternate world comes up, people are immediatly pairing it up with SAO, well maybe SAOwas one of the first series coming with an alternate world, so what? Then why not pair up all romance animes and say that they are the same? \"Main protagonists in SAO and No Game No Life(NGNL) are almost the same\" - well I don't see how people come to that conclusion, the idea of the main hero being an outcast or \"one vs. the world\" is used in a lot of animes, but that doesn't make me dislike them. Besides this show has some huge potential in my eyes and I think if it will turn out good  in plot, then it will shine even brighter than now.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the review\\n\\n\r\nStory - The main plot in NGNL wasn't something brand new, but it was actually a good mixture of genres. It made me laugh, it made me fired up from time to time and for about last 4-5 months it was the only anime that made my hair stand up from excitement. I think this still was a breeze of something new this year, because it was finally a show that lied close to my heart, it was serious, it was funny, it made me sad that I watched it, because even overwatching it won't bring back those same emotions/feelings. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt - To me the art was flawless, it was a bit different from other animes, but it managed to make my eye relax watching it. Don't know if I should mention it but it was all good, no creepy backgrounds like in Pandora Hearts. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound - the sound was also well done, the Opening and Ending themes were enjoyable, but not very memorable and they brought a little more atmosphere to the anime. The voice acting (Japanese) was really good, all the characters had the voices that suited them pretty good in my opinion. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - This is were the show really shined. All the characters were well done, there were no \"filler characters\", because all the characters who were introduced played a role in the main story. The main protagonist wasn't anything special, but in my language there is such a saying \"Everything brilliant is simple\", so I think that he was looking just the way he had to. As for the other characters (Almost all girls) they were all really pretty and had something special to each of them in their looks. They were all kawaiii and had a veriety of race, personality and *cough* breast size :) . And by the way I didn't read the light novel, but what gender is Tet or a God doesn't have a gender? It's bugging me for some reason. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I really enjoyed it to the fullest, everything was to my liking. I don't know what to say more here. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - It was really an awesome time watching this anime, I don't know how some people may put it under 5, but I guess we are all different. I would recommend it to everyone who likes brain games, cute girls and just positive and not dull animes.\\n",
