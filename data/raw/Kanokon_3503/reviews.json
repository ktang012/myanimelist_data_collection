            "content": "If you're not into ecchi shows, steer away. If you like them, maybe you'll enjoy Kanokon. If you like wolf/fox girls as well, Kanokon is a show you probably want to watch.\r\nThe premise is basic, and not really original. The \"hot\" girl (Chizuru), who also happens to be a fox spirit, is totally in love with the most lady-shy boy (Kouta) around. Then another one comes (Nozomu), she is a wolf spirit at that, and guess what? She happens to love him too. They both fight for his attention with a lot of ecchi antics, and the rest I'll leave to your imagination...\r\nThe story itselfis pretty much an episode-by-episode story; there's not a lot of stuff that binds the episodes together. The ecchi-ness isn't lacking; Chizuru and Nozomu's ecchi-filled attempts at winning Kouta's affection comes out of nowhere sometimes, and if you're a fan of it, you'll more than likely enjoy it..\\n\\n\r\nThe animation wasn't all that; everyone looked much younger than they actually are - Kouta looks like he's an elementary school student when he's actually a high school student. That has its impact on the overall feel of the show (ecchi + people who looks like elementary school students = bad combination), but you'll probably get used to it. At least I did. Aside that, the animation quality is fair enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is average, nothing spectacular, but nothing out of place either. The OP and ED themes are fair too, but not something I'd listen to aside when watching the show. Voice acting is okay too, though Kouta sounds like he's an elementary school student too &gt;_&lt;\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nothing really special. No character development, and no original characters can drag down the enjoyment factor if you're picky when it comes to that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a fair show, but nothing exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "Kanokon never gave me a boring moment to think about why I am watching this. First off, this is a \"love it, or hate it\" anime. Those who can withstand the ecchiness will love it, else they'll find it very annoying or to some extend even disgusting (repulsive is the word I am getting at...). It is plainly obvious that the anime is targeting the MALE audience. Yes girls, this anime is NOT FOR YOU! With that in mind, we'll proceed with the review.\r\nThis is perhaps THE closest anime to hentai you can ever find (well, lets just say it is at least on parto the well know fan service friendly Ikkitousen series). The ecchiness of Kanokon is beyond imagination! Though the rating states \"Mild Nudity\", I think it is more appropriate for it to say \"Heavy Nudity\" (especially after watching episode 7).\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nFor a 12 episode long anime, the story is bit on the slow side at the beginning. Though I understand that some episodes were needed for character development.  It is nice on one hand that the producer managed to wrap things up with various couples in the show, but there were still mysteries left unresolved. The most notable one is the mystery behind the young girl with the teddy bear. Perhaps they will cover that in the manga (if it\u2019s not already been covered), or perhaps there\u2019ll be a 2nd season for Kanokon, we\u2019ll wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork:\\n\r\nThe artwork was a bit weird for me at first (mainly the eyes and the cheeks\u2026they look really \u201ccartoon-ish\u201d), but after getting used to it, the animation quality is actually quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nOthers:\\n\r\nNothing particular to comment on regarding the sound (though the opening is quite good for the show). Characters are all very lively (though not always in a believable way). \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is very very enjoyable if you are planning on watching ecchi anime to begin with. But for those who are in fact intending to watch hentai, then you might be disappointed (well perhaps you can try the DVD specials, those are known for intense fan service).\\n\r\nLastly, I would like to praise the director for doing a job well done. He has so cleverly made an anime just bordering the 17+/18+ line. I can\u2019t imagine watching this on prime time anime channels here in my country.",

            "content": "I really feel like I need a shower and a delousing after watching this show.  Kanokon manages to be one of the most perverted and in many ways disturbing things I have ever watched.  It\u2019s fortunate that it was short, because I doubt that I could have finished it had it been any longer.\r\nKanokon basically doesn\u2019t have a story.  A weak an uninteresting boy starts his year at a new high school where he is inexplicably besieged by hot girls.  Standard echii anime fare here.  The problem is nothing interesting ever happens.  Kouta tries to avoid the affections ofall the girls throwing themselves at him and the girls just keep trying, getting more and more outrageous as the series unfolds.  There is some comedy to be found though.  Kanokon does have its moments, if you can suspend your disbelief over Kouta and his lack of manliness.  The interactions between Chizuru and all her rivals for his affections are pretty funny.  Though after a while even this becomes less funny after you see the same joke for the tenth time.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that bothered me the most however was the characters.  Well one in particular.. Kouta.  Why are all these girls throwing themselves at a weak, boring, underdeveloped boy who looks like he should be entering the 3rd grade instead of being in High School.  High School? Really?  Seeing this boy get molested episode after episode made me want to call the police more than it made me laugh.  Chizuru and Nozomu are really the only highlights of the show from a character aspect.  They are the only ones who are genuinely funny or even slightly interesting.  However the fox/wolf spirit aspect of the pair are never properly developed and seem to have been added solely to bridge the time in between Kouta's next molestation.\\n\\n\r\nVisually Kanokon looks great.  Despite Chizuru's gravity defying measurements she is still pretty adorable as are the other girls.  Again Kouta takes points away because of the way he looks.  The voice acting is really good and it does save the series in some respects.  Though not even one of my favorites Mamiko Noto could make me like Kouta.  The music is also very strong.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a diehard harem fan and love fan service, loli's, fox-spirits, hentai, and huge breasts smothering small children this is your show!  Anyone else should preserve the IQ points you will lose watching it.\\n",

            "content": "Holy crap, it's finally over! The anime of my dreadful loathing! This anime was just so bad, I HAD to write a review on it. \r\nKanokon was obviously made with horny sex craving  boys as its audience. You want fanservice? It has fanservice. You want naked chicks? This anime has it. In fact, this anime goes over-the-top borderline with its sexual innuendos, activities and visual eye candy. The main character, Kouta, is stalked by two girls, both being what men usually crave. The ready-and-willing big-breasted pretty girl, and the ready-and-willing breast-less loli character. Both want sex from him, and will do anything to doit. To sum it up, this anime is probably the closest you'll get to a hentai without it actually being a hentai.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story was mediocre, at best. I loved the whole 'demons and spirits mingle with the humans', thing, but that's about where it ended. The arc with the little loli-girl and her Nue partner was the closest this series got to an actual plot, and was probably the  only part of the series I really enjoyed, since it mildly turned away from the ecchi to focus on action and combat. The fact that two girls follow and want to bed one boy who looks like he should be in grade-school was enough to turn me off. I'm a girl, and I love my shota, but this is just unbelievably unrealistic to a very fine degree. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime really shines. The art is undeniably some of the best in the anime released this spring, and I probably won't forget the beauty of Kanokon's style anytime soon. To be honest, it was probably the art that made me stick with and endure the show to the last episode. Even I have to admit that the animation remained smooth throughout the entire series. Maybe when animating the males it fell slightly, but when doesn't that happen when you're watching an ecchi or harem anime? The Art would have gotten a perfect 10 if it wasn't for my lingering thoughts that the animation was made like this solely to tune up the ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nNot really much to say here. The only really great point of the sound is the voice-acting. Of course, to most that's the whole deal right? I don't really remember the music that much, so that goes to show that it wasn't all too good in my opinion. Yeah.... this is all I can really say about the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were decent enough. I didn't really like the fact that poor little Kouta's called 'the ero-king' by all the girls and is put down by that, even though it wasn't his fault. Of course, that seems to be the fate of all boys in harem and ecchi animes. Even if a face-plant into the nearest rack was an accident, it's ALWAYS the boy's fault. Poor, poor boys. There were only three characters that succeeded in putting a smile on my face whenever they were onscreen. And that's Tayura, and the twins Ai and Ren. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIs it over yeeeet?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime had me checking my player's episode length to see how much longer I had to suffer through another episode of boobs, sex and girls that want sex. I was so bored through most of the episodes I would pause about every eight minutes to go see what was happening elsewhere on the net. Yes. It was THAT good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nOverall? Don't watch it unless you're a boy that gets off on this kind of stuff. Or a  girl that can tolerate this anime that greatly degrades women.",

            "content": "First of all, hide this anime from anyone you live with. Unless they like hentai too.\r\nYes indeed, this is THE closest thing to hentai you will probably ever see in an anime. It's nuts. But what's underneath all the fanservice, you ask? Well, a mediocre storyline, I'm sorry to say. This anime focuses all it's energy on the fanserivce (like the manga does, so no surprise there). Let's jump right in.\r\nSTORY: 6/10\r\nIt's really not that inventive; the whole story feels like a setup so that Kouta can get into ecchi situations. Two spirit girls start liking him, a bunch of random crap happens. No realmovement of the story, but what can you expect...\\n\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe whole anime I was extremely annoyed at how young Kouta looks. That's like 10 years old, man! OH well... besides that, the eye styles for the anime were new and kinda cool for a change. The rest was just mediocre\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing special, nothing at all in fact. You never really see what Kouta thinks about anything else, same goes for the other characters. I would've liked to see more of the principal, that guy cracked me up. Besides that, everyones mind is filled with 75% fanserice...\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: ~8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis one really depends on who watches it. If you enjoy fanservice, then 10/10. If you hate it, then realize this anime is fanserice, and walk away now. that would give this a 3/10. This combined with some actually genuinely funny moments are what make up Kanokon. I actually laughed out loud at some parts, but if you're only looking for comedy, you'll have to brave the storm of fanservice or walk away. I would suggest the latter. For me, however, this was an enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI almost always take enjoyment to be the main influence of my overall, because it should be. This anime is not about a good story, or well developed characters. It's essentially about fanservice, and although that was enjoyable at the time, it really wears off, to be honest. I walked away from Kenshin thinking &quot;YES, now THAT was a true anime!&quot; I walked away from Kanokon tihnking &quot;why didnt I spend this time to rewatch the first 12 episodes of Kenshin?&quot; At the time it was enjoyable, though, so give it a try if you like fanservice.",

            "content": "Omg, this has got to be the worst anime I have ever had the misfortune to stubbornly watch all the way through .___.; I finished it when the last episode was subbed, but I've only just thought about writing a review. Also I'm tired today, so please bear with me guys ;3\r\nStory\r\nStory? HAH. There pretty much is no story. Kanokon's story is none existant. It's just about how the overly-horny-for-a-little-shouta-boy Chizuru trys to get Kouta, the boy, to have sex with her.\r\nRight at the beginning there was certain potential involving the fight scenes and the concept of Chizuru being a fox deity, but nothing wasever played out into anything deeper than &quot;oh look, she has a tail every now and then.&quot; Seriously, the writers seemed to completely forget about the supposed main story line and just had fun writing this almost-hentai script. This series is as close to hentai as you'll ever get without watching hentai itself.\\n\r\nIt's aimed for guys who get off on seeing chunky chicks like Chizuru take all her clothes off at any given oppotunity.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nNothing special here. The very few fight scenes that were shown were fairly average, Chizuru looked like she was covered in oil all the time because she was so damn shiny, and the characters' eyes were drawn funny. Not to my taste really, but then again it wasn't dreadful.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe only reason why I gave the series a 2 rather than a 1 overall was because of the music. It was absolutely beautiful, totally what I enjoy and it fitted rather well with the series as both songs were about love and physically wanting someone. Especially the ending song, sung by Sakakibara Yui. It was so upbeat in the chorus and really made me want to dance XD;\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nWhat can I say about them that's positive? Nothing. They were boring, standard, flat, 2D, recycled and had no depth. They were there to show panties and get naked and nothing more. Boring as hell.\\n\r\nNozomu made me laugh at the beginning, but then she got boring. She was only there to make Chizuru want to cling onto Kouta even more. And Kouta himself, he was such a drippy little thing. Even though he obviously didn't want to do those kinds of things with Chizuru he never actually tried to stop her because he was too much of a weakling. Seriously, he really pissed me off.\\n\r\nThe only highlight was the twins, but they were barely shown. If they had been in it more, then my rating would have gone up to around a 4.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this series one bit. I only watched it right the way through to the end because I really wanted to say &quot;hey look, I put up with it&quot; and also because I hate dropping series. And I guess I'm stubborn too ^^; never again will I watch a series as dreadful and brainlessly ecchi as this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nOnly watch it if you want some hardcore ecchi that is on the brink of hentai. Otherwise, miss it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you loved this series then I'm sorry that our views don't mix. But I really truly hated this pile of rubbish. :)\\n\r\nYeah~ hate the review if you want. But deep down, you know I'm only telling the truth ;3",

So when the subs came out, I downloaded them every week, watched them, and this is what I thought about it.\r\nStory: There wasn't really much of a story, as this anime was quite the slice-of-life anime. Every episode was basically Chizuru and Nozomu trying to seduce and get into the pants of the main character, Kouta. There was a fair bit of comedy, but not gut-bustingly funny. Drama around the last few episodes were very meh, itdidn't really have much effect. Every episode, I'll admit, was repetitive, but the action definitely made up for it, as I will explain below.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Oh damn, out of all the ecchi animes I've watch, this one has the best art, especially the characters. Tons and tons of bare skin, to the point where people blogging the show asked if this was a soft-core hentai. The bodies, especially Chizuru, were drawn oh-so-well, really showing her figure well. The other characters were also drawn well, the animation was solid, and it made use of lots of different colours and settings effectively.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Voice acting was good, but I hated Kouta's voice. This boy must have no balls, because he has the highest pitched voice in the anime, and it got DAMN ANNOYING after a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Very cliche. Kouta is the typical useless/ball-less harem lead, and I didn't like him much, due to him always trying and avoid Chizuru's advances. Chizuru was the big breasted, main character loving female character, always trying to seduce him, but I never got the impression that she was slutty much. Maybe determined is a good word.  Nozomu is the silent loli also wanting to get into Kouta's pants, and she was boring to watch. I thought that the side characters were more interesting than the main characters to watch, especially Tayura and Asahina. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is where the anime shines. Hordes and hordes of wonderful, life giving, bloodloss-inducing, bouncy ecchiness. I loved it, this show was intended to be eye candy, and it performed very well. Hell, the ecchiness alone is enough to warrant rewatching the series, and I do plan to do that sometime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was a very fun ride watching Kanokon every week, it was interesting enough to keep you watching it, it had more than enough action to get your blood rushing, and it was generally enjoyable to watch. Definitely one of the better ecchi/harem animes out there, and if you aren't the type to analyse every bit of the plot, characters and logic of animes, you will like this.",

            "content": "Kanokon\r\nSo this anime is one of those that you either love it or hate it, you will like it if you like Ecchi a lot, you will hate it if you don't.\r\nStory\r\nIt's not a complex story, i don't think there's a story but you have a high school group of friends in which most of them are not normal humans but spirits in form of humans. The story revolves around Kouta and Chizuru and later on Nozomu, both of them will tease Kouta with their bodies but this kid is a wuss and does nothing with them, only screams when this happens, tho sometimes hegrows balls to interact with their bodies or just Chizuru's body to be specific, there's interaction with the rest of the group and there's some fighting action, there's romance and a lot of slice of life elements, that simplicity was fine.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\r\nI liked the art and how detailed this was for being from 2008, good art style and of course those boobs physics. The sound was good, the voice acting was good, the background music was good, and i liked a lot the OP but not the ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe character were very good, you will want to see more of them even if you don't know their back story, you will want to see more Nozumu for how funny she was more Chizuru because she is likeable and voluptuos and i wanted to see more of the hungry twins they were funny and had their own personalities and the rest of the group of course are interesting for a strange reason.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really wanted to see more of this supernatural slice of life comedy, because i really fell for the characters and wanted to see more of them and because of the ecchi too and my enjoyment for weird as it sounds was great, maybe because it was one of the anime series that brought me back to watch anime.",

Then after about episode 2 i thought to myself \"why am i watching this instead of porn?\"\r\nI found it incredibly difficult to swallow this anime mainly because i hated the main character, Kouta.  Kouta is the definition of pussy.  Hes some 10 year old super small, shy, gay, pussy assed little kid.  That's all i can say.  I really think that they could have made this show hilarious if they had replaced the main leadwith a more masculine douche bad type of guy.  It may sound bad, but i could see this anime being beyond hilarious if that happened.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  I just couldn't really enjoy this, because im just not into a little 10 year old being raped by a foxy babe. That's dumb. I mean some of the situations are funny, but the wolf is a bitch too.  The only person that i liked was Chizuru, maybe it was the boobs talking but she was the only fairly likable character.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was ok, but if you really want to enjoy this a fraction of a bit more you would need to watch the Japanese version.  The dub was just bad.  You could tell that the people were reading that shit off a piece of paper and theyre reactions sucked.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven though this anime may have its faults (A lot of them) I felt that this anime could have been so much more, WHY?  Its because Kouta the little pussy just ruins it for me.  I have never seen such a little pussy in my life.  It makes me feel like beating him up and banging Chizuru myself and then replacing him with a more masculine guy to at least make the anime 500 times funnier.",

Boobies, melons, bosoms, fun-bags, playthings, tits, breasts. Still not bothered? Well, you have passed the \"Kanokon\" test, my friend. Welcome to a magical anime, filled with boobs, boobs, and, yet, more boobs.\r\nThe way the story begins sets the tone for the rest of the story. Not in the way that they continue to develop it, more like they let you know that it's there, basically causing all the drama in the series, but let \"mini-arcs\", spanning an episode or two, act as the story forthe show.\\n\r\nAs you could imagine - it's predictable. And, oddly enough, it was a nice predictable. I was never, EVER, bored watching \"Kanokon\" and I don't think you should be either. Unless you didn't pass my Kanokon test.\\n\r\nTo me, it's not really a harem as much as it is a borderline hentai/rom/com. There's one other girl, but she seems like a third-wheel. You know from the get-go that she won't win our hero's heart and the other, more \"main\" heroine will likely come out on top. However, each mini-arc is enough to keep me entertained, and the base arc of her being a fox deity keeps up the quickfire pace (as it should be) of this 12-episode-long anime. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, well... it acted like a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you have fabulously drawn characters and their movements are captured flawlessly. On the other hand, you have a hero who acts and looks like he could be a 10-year-old girl. I don't want my hero who's involved in a HAREM to be a 10-year-old girl. Coy and shy is okay to an extent, but when you put his animated character and personality together you really get an immature hero that's hard to root for, hard to identify with, and too childish. 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound is sound. I found this anime's sound to be a nice, refreshing change of pace from the constant yelling in \"Seto no Hayame\". The voice actors are good; that ten-year-old girl lookalike hero just bugged the hell out of me and his voice definitely matched his small presence and stature. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nLike I've stated above, I had a big problem with our hero being the hero. That said, the rest of the cast was good and solid. I wished that I would've seen a little more of the wolf deity woman (the name slips my mind at the moment) and that her involvement with the main character was more substantial. The supporting cast is variously funny and witty dialog is interjected here-and-there by the likes; a solid batch of characters. \\n\\n\r\nYou know, I enjoyed this anime a lot more than I thought I would. Coming into this I knew I was going to be bombarded with hentai-esque images and ecchi moments everywhere, but that really gave the show its own, specific, identity. \"I am 'basically a soft-core porn show and so what?'\" \\n\r\nIf the anime that I watch has comes to terms with what it IS, instead of catering to something that it is NOT, I will enjoy it much more thoroughly than an anime that seems to be \"faking\". (Pun intended.) 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think the 1-10 options and word classifcations pretty much nail this one of the head: \"Good\". Nothing spectacular, nothing revolutionary. Just some good ol' ecchi/harem/rom/com fun that's a fun time to watch and let your mind drift elsewhere - probably under the chair. 7/10.",

            "content": "Between the 10 Freeway, Downtown Los Angeles traffic, and missing the first hour of a cyber security conference, what did I dislike the most of those eventful two days? That would be the anime show I was watching as I sat in the car. It took us roughly two hours to travel between Destination A and Destination B, both ways as the traffic wouldn't let up. Kanokon was the show that I was happening to watch; oddly enough, I was looking for an ecchi show as I waited. Its 12-episode length allowed me to finish the entire show within the span of the trips sinceit was a two-day conference, and it wasn't gridlock or 90-degree heat that made this show a horrible watch. I have determined that the show itself is the reason why this show is not a good show.\\n\\n\r\nKanokon is your typical ecchi, your typical fantasy show, your typical harem-style show, with one minor detail: it's all completely pointless. How pointless? It's a knife that doesn't cut, nor is it meant to spread butter, nor is it heavy enough to act as a paperweight. It's a pencil that doesn't write and the eraser is as rock-solid as a brick. It's a love story that's actually worse than Twilight, as the notorious Internet meme goes. Don't get me wrong. I am attempting to avoid misleading you into thinking that I hate this show out of pure spite, which is why I will try to write what I saw in this show without giving it a personal bias.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I did say that I would try.\\n\\n\r\nStory: What if you were stuck in a world of spirits and \"yokai\" and demons and devils, and there were a couple of things that you've been made aware of? Spirits cannot harm humans and a kiss can transfer powers between two individuals, and a whole mess of demons do not approve of your questionable love affair? I think I described the world of Kanokon in a nutshell, but for those who want to ask \"why does this happen\", or \"what background does it have behind it\" or \"is there anything else?\" Unfortunately, that's all I picked up. There's no history behind the spirits aside from the given that they co-exist with humans and the storyline has no other motive behind it other than allowing fan service to exist. How can I rephrase that? \"It's the plot that works for plot.\"\\n\\n\r\nWell, look at that. A cheesy line to describe a cheesy storyline.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Fan service comes in droves; there's no end to it. The funny thing about it is the way they try to make it look important to the storyline, but when you come right down to it, take out the fan service and it has absolutely nothing to do with the way the story progresses. All they did showcase was  a timid prepubescent boy and a girl with an insatiable sex drive using any excuse they could to take a stab at attempted intercourse.\\n\\n\r\nIt's such a shame as well. To make up for everything else that this show lacks in, fan service HAS to present itself. I'm sure for those who prefer fan service in their shows, Kanokon will be an easy show for them to get along with, but for those who enjoy it in moderation, Kanokon is definitely a show to avoid like the ex-girlfriend that is desperately trying to contact you at 12:00 midnight.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: If the characters rolled out of a factory, which I'm sure was really the case, each one of them has exemplified everything that was wrong with Chevy in the 1980's. There's nothing special about them and most of them seem like they have a screw loose. The protagonist, for example, Minamoto Chizuru, has no reason to love Kouta, the male lead. We're never given a proper reason, yet she does (and it may be safe to say that dropping her on her head was a normal childhood occurrence). It doesn't stop at a simple interest, which is acceptable in this situation; it is a wild addiction that turns her into a first-class whore every time she is in contact with Kouta. Speaking of Kouta, I have never seen a more useless male lead, one that is easily molded by anything that flies in his direction, like grains of sand or the common housefly. He also objects to Chizuru's physical affection, but why is it that at the end of the series, he can finally muster up the courage to say he loves her? I'm pretty sure down the line, he gave up and allowed Chizuru to have her way with him, however the hell that's about to happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe support cast are somehow the most appealing characters in this entire show, with the exception of the antagonists. The antagonists make just as much sense as the main cast, who will set the stage for a fight for a few reasons: to declare love for no good reason, to test someone for no good reason, or to pick a fight for no good reason. One of the antagonists that picks a fight tries to take Chizuru from Kouta, and after he is hit with one energy beam, he packs up and leaves as if nothing happened because he is a cowardly pretty boy who was more worried about the smudge on his leather coat than losing the girl he \"likes\" to a 6th grade kid. Another spirit comes along, begins attacking Chizuru, and after trading one or two blows, she leaves and says, \"oh, I was just testing you.\" What's the point of that? If I wanted to test something, I'd just become a teacher and hand out tests to everyone that walks into the classroom. The last couple just attacks them. Why? Why would you want to attack someone without any reason? \"Oh yes, it would be fun, wouldn't it-\" come off it already. Now you're just confirming your stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I mentioned above that this is a fantasy show. Fantasy shows generally come with action. Kanokon, unfortunately, has fighting sequences. Why is it unfortunate? Because fight sequences stop themselves halfway before finishing. Each of the antagonists flee halfway through the battle, and this paves the stage for multiple anti-climactic sequences, which become quite tedious to watch. Maybe I'm expecting too much from an ecchi show, but what if I compared it to a show like Omamori Himari? That's a harem with ecchi scenes AND action, and they pulled it off correctly. Why couldn't Kanokon do it? Or rather, what blender did you use to screw up this show so badly, and what setting was it on?\\n\\n\r\nAs always, I'm only a fan of ecchi in moderation. Since I'm not the type of guy to enjoy shows filled to the brim with fan service, I'll have to let you decide that for yourself; do you watch for the plot or do you watch for the plot?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Believe it or not, I have a least favorite anime that's not called Kanokon. Despite all that I can say about this show, I would still watch it in front of Air Gear, which would be as rock bottom as rock bottom gets for me, unless another show wants to take its place. Sure, it avoided being one of my most disliked shows, but it's still much closer to the bottom of my list than it is to the top. I do know that shows have potential to reach greater heights if they would just throw out a good number of useless elements, but Kanokon lacks any of that potential. There's no story, the characters are flimsy pushovers, and fan service has always been a useless addition to any show. I know a good number of people out there enjoyed it much more than I did, but Kanokon isn't just a bad show. It's a bad show with a fanbase. \\n\\n\r\nI don't mind if you took my words and said, \"oh, I'm watching this show anyways.\" In fact, I couldn't care less what you did with your time just as long as it doesn't cut into mine. But there are only two paths you can take with this show: love it and dismiss every word of offense towards this show or hate it and end up realizing that you wasted a good chunk of your time watching bad characters look like they're about to do something.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a note to the writers: next time you want to blend something, I recommend that you use my personal choice, the Vita-Mix 5000. It juices everything in the cup fairly well and the end result is a delicious smoothie.",

            "content": "As my first review, I'll try to keep from rambling on, but I'll give an honest opinion. Why not start with one of the most borderline-jumping ecchi/hentai animes I've yet seen?\r\nWhen I first came across this series, I watched the first episode looking for comedy, and a bit of ecchi. Funny, random, so on. I saw the first episode, and I have to say I was struck dumb. I had not yet seen an ecchi that so closely bordered hentai, with all its sexual innuendo, panty shots, and basically only covering the details that would make it hentai. Fanservice here, fanservice there, fanservice everywhere. Puttingthat aside, the anime is pretty funny, and rather spontaneous, so I was not bored at any time.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nNot exactly original, and development of the backstory is completely absent. That being said the story isn't cliche, just not anything new. Having so many random things happen, plus three girls trying to get all over the main protagonist (Kouta), not too original either, but at least it wasn't absolutely junk.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art:\\n\r\nAt the beginning, it's more &quot;cartoonish&quot; approach to traditonal shojo style isn't too bad, but I really could do without the extremely blushed cheeks that make it seem they're always drunk. But everything is drawn with style and a bit of flair, so it doesn't turn me off too much. (No pun intended) Throughout the series, I noticed a lot of dawn/dusk scenes that blew out my screen with so many yellows and oranges that I got quite sick of it. Otherwise, the majority of scenes are well made and smooth.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOP was pretty well put, ED was a bit annoying. The soundtrack throughout the anime was well set, but to me, it only aids in the projection of the anime to the viewer, so I usually only notice it if its a piece I already know, if its terrible, or if it's a freakin' masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters aren't built up past a few flashbacks and some obvious character traits. There isn't much backstory to speak of, and for good reason.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nComedy comes in weird forms, and if insane amounts of sexual innuendo and the like make me laugh, then I enjoyed it. Lots of random and completely unexpected little jokes helped with this score.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nExpect the closest thing to hentai without it being hentai. I'm sure that's a tired thing to say now, but there is no other way to describe the series. However, do expect laughs and a good time if you like a bit of ecchi/harem with comedy. It's remarkably short and a bit of a joke if you're looking for something deeper, so do not expect too much.",

            "content": "Oh god, When I first heard of this show, I thought that it would be different. Why did I even think it was going to be different? The characters are perverted, and act strangely odd.\r\nThe story goes way to fast, bringing up more questions then answers. All the story is becomes a love triangle with a short little kid in the middle of it. This is pretty much Hentai without the sex. It\u2019s messed up and would be much better if they just used the sex in order to have a more interesting story line. AND THERE IS NO ENDING! It gives us a \u2018readthe manga\u2019 ending that always pisses me off. If I wanted to read the manga, I would of done so already or read it instead of watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nChizuru is a really interesting girl who is really hangs onto Kouta all the time. She is extremely pushy and keeps wanting him to go out with her. All this teasing really pushes him from her all the time. It also seems that all the time, she ends up trying to sleep with him. When she shows that she\u2019s a fox, he actually for some reason doesn\u2019t care much. Then we have the problem with him falling in love with her slightly. There is also the fact that he and her end up becoming one whenever they kiss and she wants to be with him. Nozomu doesn\u2019t seem to have much personality in the beginning but and always seems to act like a love rival.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters rarely have any personality out of just a standard archy types with not much of a story behind how they act. The characters are all 2 Dimensional. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the show actually got better as it went on, and around the 4th episode, it actually got a lot better artwork and the voices weren\u2019t as stale. It feels like they got into the show more. Not only that but I believe it was the 5th episode where my favorite character was introduced. To bad he only stayed for one episode though. I really liked Saku Ezomori.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the beginning is pretty standard as well as the animation. It pretty much has a loneliness walking style to it and showing the characters. And then somehow, the main character turning into a \u2018fox boy\u2019 for some strange reason. The animation is really butt ugly in many aspects for the background characters, making them lose much detail. The main characters may be detailed in a sense but the personality is really bland. \\n\\n\r\nThe voices\u2026 dear god the voices\u2026 They messed them all up. Chizuru is really high voiced and can probably hurt my ears. Kouta sounds like a little child, not like he would be in the same grade as all the other characters. The script is a bit choppy and again really doesn\u2019t explain much. Sometimes the script is delivered without much feeling. Also some of the lip sinks are bad, they don\u2019t work right.\\n",

However, I'm rating Kanokon first, so I hope my review doesn't sound too cynical. Here goes.\r\nThere's really -no- story to this anime. The only thing I managed to get out of it was a bit of arousal. But I suppose that's why they call it ecchi. It's borderline hentai, in my opinion. I think I saw up Chizuru's skirt over one hundred times. But seriously. It was really pushed to the limit to the point where it wasn't even entertaining when ithappened. The flashing was just too common. Fanservice is nice, but there's a point where enough is enough. This is definitely NOT a family anime. Hide this. Far away. Out of sight.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Kouta, looks like he's in preschool. Yeah. I said preschool. And his eyes are ridiculously... large... and... and well. Yeah. It's bothersome. He would have looked better with a bag on his head. And then you have Chizuru who, surprise surprise, falls in love with Kouta. But what would any anime be without the rival? As a result, you then have Nozomu, clinging to Kouta nearly just as much as Chizuru. Throughout this whole anime, you're probably asking yourself why you're watching this. I'm surprised I didn't just toss this halfway through. Maybe it's because I'm perverted. Yeah, actually, that's probably it. Oh, did I mention, Chizuru and Nozomu are spirits? Yep. A fox and wolf spirit to be exact. Sounds cool, but it really doesn't affect the anime too much. My favorite character ended up being Tayura, probably because he was one of the more normal characters. But that's enough of that. The characters were mediocre at best, and whenever I watched Nozomu, I swear she reminded me of Yuki Nagato from The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya. XP Probably because she was the silent type. OH WELL.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is one of those things that you'll end up liking, or end up hating. I'll give it an award for maintaining an \"ecchi\" label, even though most of the show, you're listening to perverted comments, and watching Chizuru push Kouta into her breasts so she can, lol, \"spoil him.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for fanservice, this is it. It's just so blatant that it's IMPOSSIBLE to miss. Just don't expect too much out of this one.",

If you like wolf/fox girls as well, Kanokon is a show you probably want to watch.\r\nThe premise is basic, and not really original. The \"hot\" girl (Chizuru), who also happens to be a fox spirit, is totally in love with the most lady-shy boy (Kouta) around. Then another one comes (Nozomu), she is a wolf spirit at that, and guess what? She happens to love him too. They both fight for his attention with a lot of ecchi antics, and the rest I'll leave to your imagination...\r\nThe story itselfis pretty much an episode-by-episode story; there's not a lot of stuff that binds the episodes together. The ecchi-ness isn't lacking; Chizuru and Nozomu's ecchi-filled attempts at winning Kouta's affection comes out of nowhere sometimes, and if you're a fan of it, you'll more than likely enjoy it..\\n\\n\r\nThe animation wasn't all that; everyone looked much younger than they actually are - Kouta looks like he's an elementary school student when he's actually a high school student. That has its impact on the overall feel of the show (ecchi + people who looks like elementary school students = bad combination), but you'll probably get used to it. At least I did. Aside that, the animation quality is fair enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is average, nothing spectacular, but nothing out of place either. The OP and ED themes are fair too, but not something I'd listen to aside when watching the show. Voice acting is okay too, though Kouta sounds like he's an elementary school student too &gt;_&lt;\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nothing really special. No character development, and no original characters can drag down the enjoyment factor if you're picky when it comes to that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a fair show, but nothing exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "Kanokon never gave me a boring moment to think about why I am watching this. First off, this is a \"love it, or hate it\" anime. Those who can withstand the ecchiness will love it, else they'll find it very annoying or to some extend even disgusting (repulsive is the word I am getting at...). It is plainly obvious that the anime is targeting the MALE audience. Yes girls, this anime is NOT FOR YOU! With that in mind, we'll proceed with the review.\r\nThis is perhaps THE closest anime to hentai you can ever find (well, lets just say it is at least on parto the well know fan service friendly Ikkitousen series). The ecchiness of Kanokon is beyond imagination! Though the rating states \"Mild Nudity\", I think it is more appropriate for it to say \"Heavy Nudity\" (especially after watching episode 7).\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nFor a 12 episode long anime, the story is bit on the slow side at the beginning. Though I understand that some episodes were needed for character development.  It is nice on one hand that the producer managed to wrap things up with various couples in the show, but there were still mysteries left unresolved. The most notable one is the mystery behind the young girl with the teddy bear. Perhaps they will cover that in the manga (if it\u2019s not already been covered), or perhaps there\u2019ll be a 2nd season for Kanokon, we\u2019ll wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork:\\n\r\nThe artwork was a bit weird for me at first (mainly the eyes and the cheeks\u2026they look really \u201ccartoon-ish\u201d), but after getting used to it, the animation quality is actually quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nOthers:\\n\r\nNothing particular to comment on regarding the sound (though the opening is quite good for the show). Characters are all very lively (though not always in a believable way). \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is very very enjoyable if you are planning on watching ecchi anime to begin with. But for those who are in fact intending to watch hentai, then you might be disappointed (well perhaps you can try the DVD specials, those are known for intense fan service).\\n\r\nLastly, I would like to praise the director for doing a job well done. He has so cleverly made an anime just bordering the 17+/18+ line. I can\u2019t imagine watching this on prime time anime channels here in my country.",

            "content": "I really feel like I need a shower and a delousing after watching this show.  Kanokon manages to be one of the most perverted and in many ways disturbing things I have ever watched.  It\u2019s fortunate that it was short, because I doubt that I could have finished it had it been any longer.\r\nKanokon basically doesn\u2019t have a story.  A weak an uninteresting boy starts his year at a new high school where he is inexplicably besieged by hot girls.  Standard echii anime fare here.  The problem is nothing interesting ever happens.  Kouta tries to avoid the affections ofall the girls throwing themselves at him and the girls just keep trying, getting more and more outrageous as the series unfolds.  There is some comedy to be found though.  Kanokon does have its moments, if you can suspend your disbelief over Kouta and his lack of manliness.  The interactions between Chizuru and all her rivals for his affections are pretty funny.  Though after a while even this becomes less funny after you see the same joke for the tenth time.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that bothered me the most however was the characters.  Well one in particular.. Kouta.  Why are all these girls throwing themselves at a weak, boring, underdeveloped boy who looks like he should be entering the 3rd grade instead of being in High School.  High School? Really?  Seeing this boy get molested episode after episode made me want to call the police more than it made me laugh.  Chizuru and Nozomu are really the only highlights of the show from a character aspect.  They are the only ones who are genuinely funny or even slightly interesting.  However the fox/wolf spirit aspect of the pair are never properly developed and seem to have been added solely to bridge the time in between Kouta's next molestation.\\n\\n\r\nVisually Kanokon looks great.  Despite Chizuru's gravity defying measurements she is still pretty adorable as are the other girls.  Again Kouta takes points away because of the way he looks.  The voice acting is really good and it does save the series in some respects.  Though not even one of my favorites Mamiko Noto could make me like Kouta.  The music is also very strong.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a diehard harem fan and love fan service, loli's, fox-spirits, hentai, and huge breasts smothering small children this is your show!  Anyone else should preserve the IQ points you will lose watching it.\\n",

            "content": "Holy crap, it's finally over! The anime of my dreadful loathing! This anime was just so bad, I HAD to write a review on it. \r\nKanokon was obviously made with horny sex craving  boys as its audience. You want fanservice? It has fanservice. You want naked chicks? This anime has it. In fact, this anime goes over-the-top borderline with its sexual innuendos, activities and visual eye candy. The main character, Kouta, is stalked by two girls, both being what men usually crave. The ready-and-willing big-breasted pretty girl, and the ready-and-willing breast-less loli character. Both want sex from him, and will do anything to doit. To sum it up, this anime is probably the closest you'll get to a hentai without it actually being a hentai.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story was mediocre, at best. I loved the whole 'demons and spirits mingle with the humans', thing, but that's about where it ended. The arc with the little loli-girl and her Nue partner was the closest this series got to an actual plot, and was probably the  only part of the series I really enjoyed, since it mildly turned away from the ecchi to focus on action and combat. The fact that two girls follow and want to bed one boy who looks like he should be in grade-school was enough to turn me off. I'm a girl, and I love my shota, but this is just unbelievably unrealistic to a very fine degree. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime really shines. The art is undeniably some of the best in the anime released this spring, and I probably won't forget the beauty of Kanokon's style anytime soon. To be honest, it was probably the art that made me stick with and endure the show to the last episode. Even I have to admit that the animation remained smooth throughout the entire series. Maybe when animating the males it fell slightly, but when doesn't that happen when you're watching an ecchi or harem anime? The Art would have gotten a perfect 10 if it wasn't for my lingering thoughts that the animation was made like this solely to tune up the ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nNot really much to say here. The only really great point of the sound is the voice-acting. Of course, to most that's the whole deal right? I don't really remember the music that much, so that goes to show that it wasn't all too good in my opinion. Yeah.... this is all I can really say about the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were decent enough. I didn't really like the fact that poor little Kouta's called 'the ero-king' by all the girls and is put down by that, even though it wasn't his fault. Of course, that seems to be the fate of all boys in harem and ecchi animes. Even if a face-plant into the nearest rack was an accident, it's ALWAYS the boy's fault. Poor, poor boys. There were only three characters that succeeded in putting a smile on my face whenever they were onscreen. And that's Tayura, and the twins Ai and Ren. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIs it over yeeeet?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime had me checking my player's episode length to see how much longer I had to suffer through another episode of boobs, sex and girls that want sex. I was so bored through most of the episodes I would pause about every eight minutes to go see what was happening elsewhere on the net. Yes. It was THAT good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nOverall? Don't watch it unless you're a boy that gets off on this kind of stuff. Or a  girl that can tolerate this anime that greatly degrades women.",

            "content": "First of all, hide this anime from anyone you live with. Unless they like hentai too.\r\nYes indeed, this is THE closest thing to hentai you will probably ever see in an anime. It's nuts. But what's underneath all the fanservice, you ask? Well, a mediocre storyline, I'm sorry to say. This anime focuses all it's energy on the fanserivce (like the manga does, so no surprise there). Let's jump right in.\r\nSTORY: 6/10\r\nIt's really not that inventive; the whole story feels like a setup so that Kouta can get into ecchi situations. Two spirit girls start liking him, a bunch of random crap happens. No realmovement of the story, but what can you expect...\\n\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe whole anime I was extremely annoyed at how young Kouta looks. That's like 10 years old, man! OH well... besides that, the eye styles for the anime were new and kinda cool for a change. The rest was just mediocre\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing special, nothing at all in fact. You never really see what Kouta thinks about anything else, same goes for the other characters. I would've liked to see more of the principal, that guy cracked me up. Besides that, everyones mind is filled with 75% fanserice...\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: ~8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis one really depends on who watches it. If you enjoy fanservice, then 10/10. If you hate it, then realize this anime is fanserice, and walk away now. that would give this a 3/10. This combined with some actually genuinely funny moments are what make up Kanokon. I actually laughed out loud at some parts, but if you're only looking for comedy, you'll have to brave the storm of fanservice or walk away. I would suggest the latter. For me, however, this was an enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI almost always take enjoyment to be the main influence of my overall, because it should be. This anime is not about a good story, or well developed characters. It's essentially about fanservice, and although that was enjoyable at the time, it really wears off, to be honest. I walked away from Kenshin thinking &quot;YES, now THAT was a true anime!&quot; I walked away from Kanokon tihnking &quot;why didnt I spend this time to rewatch the first 12 episodes of Kenshin?&quot; At the time it was enjoyable, though, so give it a try if you like fanservice.",

            "content": "Omg, this has got to be the worst anime I have ever had the misfortune to stubbornly watch all the way through .___.; I finished it when the last episode was subbed, but I've only just thought about writing a review. Also I'm tired today, so please bear with me guys ;3\r\nStory\r\nStory? HAH. There pretty much is no story. Kanokon's story is none existant. It's just about how the overly-horny-for-a-little-shouta-boy Chizuru trys to get Kouta, the boy, to have sex with her.\r\nRight at the beginning there was certain potential involving the fight scenes and the concept of Chizuru being a fox deity, but nothing wasever played out into anything deeper than &quot;oh look, she has a tail every now and then.&quot; Seriously, the writers seemed to completely forget about the supposed main story line and just had fun writing this almost-hentai script. This series is as close to hentai as you'll ever get without watching hentai itself.\\n\r\nIt's aimed for guys who get off on seeing chunky chicks like Chizuru take all her clothes off at any given oppotunity.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nNothing special here. The very few fight scenes that were shown were fairly average, Chizuru looked like she was covered in oil all the time because she was so damn shiny, and the characters' eyes were drawn funny. Not to my taste really, but then again it wasn't dreadful.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe only reason why I gave the series a 2 rather than a 1 overall was because of the music. It was absolutely beautiful, totally what I enjoy and it fitted rather well with the series as both songs were about love and physically wanting someone. Especially the ending song, sung by Sakakibara Yui. It was so upbeat in the chorus and really made me want to dance XD;\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nWhat can I say about them that's positive? Nothing. They were boring, standard, flat, 2D, recycled and had no depth. They were there to show panties and get naked and nothing more. Boring as hell.\\n\r\nNozomu made me laugh at the beginning, but then she got boring. She was only there to make Chizuru want to cling onto Kouta even more. And Kouta himself, he was such a drippy little thing. Even though he obviously didn't want to do those kinds of things with Chizuru he never actually tried to stop her because he was too much of a weakling. Seriously, he really pissed me off.\\n\r\nThe only highlight was the twins, but they were barely shown. If they had been in it more, then my rating would have gone up to around a 4.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this series one bit. I only watched it right the way through to the end because I really wanted to say &quot;hey look, I put up with it&quot; and also because I hate dropping series. And I guess I'm stubborn too ^^; never again will I watch a series as dreadful and brainlessly ecchi as this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nOnly watch it if you want some hardcore ecchi that is on the brink of hentai. Otherwise, miss it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you loved this series then I'm sorry that our views don't mix. But I really truly hated this pile of rubbish. :)\\n\r\nYeah~ hate the review if you want. But deep down, you know I'm only telling the truth ;3",

So when the subs came out, I downloaded them every week, watched them, and this is what I thought about it.\r\nStory: There wasn't really much of a story, as this anime was quite the slice-of-life anime. Every episode was basically Chizuru and Nozomu trying to seduce and get into the pants of the main character, Kouta. There was a fair bit of comedy, but not gut-bustingly funny. Drama around the last few episodes were very meh, itdidn't really have much effect. Every episode, I'll admit, was repetitive, but the action definitely made up for it, as I will explain below.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Oh damn, out of all the ecchi animes I've watch, this one has the best art, especially the characters. Tons and tons of bare skin, to the point where people blogging the show asked if this was a soft-core hentai. The bodies, especially Chizuru, were drawn oh-so-well, really showing her figure well. The other characters were also drawn well, the animation was solid, and it made use of lots of different colours and settings effectively.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Voice acting was good, but I hated Kouta's voice. This boy must have no balls, because he has the highest pitched voice in the anime, and it got DAMN ANNOYING after a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Very cliche. Kouta is the typical useless/ball-less harem lead, and I didn't like him much, due to him always trying and avoid Chizuru's advances. Chizuru was the big breasted, main character loving female character, always trying to seduce him, but I never got the impression that she was slutty much. Maybe determined is a good word.  Nozomu is the silent loli also wanting to get into Kouta's pants, and she was boring to watch. I thought that the side characters were more interesting than the main characters to watch, especially Tayura and Asahina. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is where the anime shines. Hordes and hordes of wonderful, life giving, bloodloss-inducing, bouncy ecchiness. I loved it, this show was intended to be eye candy, and it performed very well. Hell, the ecchiness alone is enough to warrant rewatching the series, and I do plan to do that sometime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was a very fun ride watching Kanokon every week, it was interesting enough to keep you watching it, it had more than enough action to get your blood rushing, and it was generally enjoyable to watch. Definitely one of the better ecchi/harem animes out there, and if you aren't the type to analyse every bit of the plot, characters and logic of animes, you will like this.",

The story revolves around Kouta and Chizuru and later on Nozomu, both of them will tease Kouta with their bodies but this kid is a wuss and does nothing with them, only screams when this happens, tho sometimes hegrows balls to interact with their bodies or just Chizuru's body to be specific, there's interaction with the rest of the group and there's some fighting action, there's romance and a lot of slice of life elements, that simplicity was fine.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\r\nI liked the art and how detailed this was for being from 2008, good art style and of course those boobs physics. The sound was good, the voice acting was good, the background music was good, and i liked a lot the OP but not the ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe character were very good, you will want to see more of them even if you don't know their back story, you will want to see more Nozumu for how funny she was more Chizuru because she is likeable and voluptuos and i wanted to see more of the hungry twins they were funny and had their own personalities and the rest of the group of course are interesting for a strange reason.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really wanted to see more of this supernatural slice of life comedy, because i really fell for the characters and wanted to see more of them and because of the ecchi too and my enjoyment for weird as it sounds was great, maybe because it was one of the anime series that brought me back to watch anime.",

            "content": "I was a bit bored and i heard that kanokon was pretty funny and it included a little bit of ecchiness which I'm OK with.  Then after about episode 2 i thought to myself \"why am i watching this instead of porn?\"\r\nI found it incredibly difficult to swallow this anime mainly because i hated the main character, Kouta.  Kouta is the definition of pussy.  Hes some 10 year old super small, shy, gay, pussy assed little kid.  That's all i can say.  I really think that they could have made this show hilarious if they had replaced the main leadwith a more masculine douche bad type of guy.  It may sound bad, but i could see this anime being beyond hilarious if that happened.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  I just couldn't really enjoy this, because im just not into a little 10 year old being raped by a foxy babe. That's dumb. I mean some of the situations are funny, but the wolf is a bitch too.  The only person that i liked was Chizuru, maybe it was the boobs talking but she was the only fairly likable character.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was ok, but if you really want to enjoy this a fraction of a bit more you would need to watch the Japanese version.  The dub was just bad.  You could tell that the people were reading that shit off a piece of paper and theyre reactions sucked.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven though this anime may have its faults (A lot of them) I felt that this anime could have been so much more, WHY?  Its because Kouta the little pussy just ruins it for me.  I have never seen such a little pussy in my life.  It makes me feel like beating him up and banging Chizuru myself and then replacing him with a more masculine guy to at least make the anime 500 times funnier.",

            "content": "B is for bouncing\r\nO is for \"out there\"\r\nO is for outlandish\r\nB is for bosoms \r\nS is for \"seriously?\"\r\nBoobs. Bothered yet? Boobies, melons, bosoms, fun-bags, playthings, tits, breasts. Still not bothered? Well, you have passed the \"Kanokon\" test, my friend. Welcome to a magical anime, filled with boobs, boobs, and, yet, more boobs.\r\nThe way the story begins sets the tone for the rest of the story. Not in the way that they continue to develop it, more like they let you know that it's there, basically causing all the drama in the series, but let \"mini-arcs\", spanning an episode or two, act as the story forthe show.\\n\r\nAs you could imagine - it's predictable. And, oddly enough, it was a nice predictable. I was never, EVER, bored watching \"Kanokon\" and I don't think you should be either. Unless you didn't pass my Kanokon test.\\n\r\nTo me, it's not really a harem as much as it is a borderline hentai/rom/com. There's one other girl, but she seems like a third-wheel. You know from the get-go that she won't win our hero's heart and the other, more \"main\" heroine will likely come out on top. However, each mini-arc is enough to keep me entertained, and the base arc of her being a fox deity keeps up the quickfire pace (as it should be) of this 12-episode-long anime. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, well... it acted like a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you have fabulously drawn characters and their movements are captured flawlessly. On the other hand, you have a hero who acts and looks like he could be a 10-year-old girl. I don't want my hero who's involved in a HAREM to be a 10-year-old girl. Coy and shy is okay to an extent, but when you put his animated character and personality together you really get an immature hero that's hard to root for, hard to identify with, and too childish. 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound is sound. I found this anime's sound to be a nice, refreshing change of pace from the constant yelling in \"Seto no Hayame\". The voice actors are good; that ten-year-old girl lookalike hero just bugged the hell out of me and his voice definitely matched his small presence and stature. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nLike I've stated above, I had a big problem with our hero being the hero. That said, the rest of the cast was good and solid. I wished that I would've seen a little more of the wolf deity woman (the name slips my mind at the moment) and that her involvement with the main character was more substantial. The supporting cast is variously funny and witty dialog is interjected here-and-there by the likes; a solid batch of characters. \\n\\n\r\nYou know, I enjoyed this anime a lot more than I thought I would. Coming into this I knew I was going to be bombarded with hentai-esque images and ecchi moments everywhere, but that really gave the show its own, specific, identity. \"I am 'basically a soft-core porn show and so what?'\" \\n\r\nIf the anime that I watch has comes to terms with what it IS, instead of catering to something that it is NOT, I will enjoy it much more thoroughly than an anime that seems to be \"faking\". (Pun intended.) 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think the 1-10 options and word classifcations pretty much nail this one of the head: \"Good\". Nothing spectacular, nothing revolutionary. Just some good ol' ecchi/harem/rom/com fun that's a fun time to watch and let your mind drift elsewhere - probably under the chair. 7/10.",

            "content": "Between the 10 Freeway, Downtown Los Angeles traffic, and missing the first hour of a cyber security conference, what did I dislike the most of those eventful two days? That would be the anime show I was watching as I sat in the car. It took us roughly two hours to travel between Destination A and Destination B, both ways as the traffic wouldn't let up. Kanokon was the show that I was happening to watch; oddly enough, I was looking for an ecchi show as I waited. Its 12-episode length allowed me to finish the entire show within the span of the trips sinceit was a two-day conference, and it wasn't gridlock or 90-degree heat that made this show a horrible watch. I have determined that the show itself is the reason why this show is not a good show.\\n\\n\r\nKanokon is your typical ecchi, your typical fantasy show, your typical harem-style show, with one minor detail: it's all completely pointless. How pointless? It's a knife that doesn't cut, nor is it meant to spread butter, nor is it heavy enough to act as a paperweight. It's a pencil that doesn't write and the eraser is as rock-solid as a brick. It's a love story that's actually worse than Twilight, as the notorious Internet meme goes. Don't get me wrong. I am attempting to avoid misleading you into thinking that I hate this show out of pure spite, which is why I will try to write what I saw in this show without giving it a personal bias.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I did say that I would try.\\n\\n\r\nStory: What if you were stuck in a world of spirits and \"yokai\" and demons and devils, and there were a couple of things that you've been made aware of? Spirits cannot harm humans and a kiss can transfer powers between two individuals, and a whole mess of demons do not approve of your questionable love affair? I think I described the world of Kanokon in a nutshell, but for those who want to ask \"why does this happen\", or \"what background does it have behind it\" or \"is there anything else?\" Unfortunately, that's all I picked up. There's no history behind the spirits aside from the given that they co-exist with humans and the storyline has no other motive behind it other than allowing fan service to exist. How can I rephrase that? \"It's the plot that works for plot.\"\\n\\n\r\nWell, look at that. A cheesy line to describe a cheesy storyline.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Fan service comes in droves; there's no end to it. The funny thing about it is the way they try to make it look important to the storyline, but when you come right down to it, take out the fan service and it has absolutely nothing to do with the way the story progresses. All they did showcase was  a timid prepubescent boy and a girl with an insatiable sex drive using any excuse they could to take a stab at attempted intercourse.\\n\\n\r\nIt's such a shame as well. To make up for everything else that this show lacks in, fan service HAS to present itself. I'm sure for those who prefer fan service in their shows, Kanokon will be an easy show for them to get along with, but for those who enjoy it in moderation, Kanokon is definitely a show to avoid like the ex-girlfriend that is desperately trying to contact you at 12:00 midnight.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: If the characters rolled out of a factory, which I'm sure was really the case, each one of them has exemplified everything that was wrong with Chevy in the 1980's. There's nothing special about them and most of them seem like they have a screw loose. The protagonist, for example, Minamoto Chizuru, has no reason to love Kouta, the male lead. We're never given a proper reason, yet she does (and it may be safe to say that dropping her on her head was a normal childhood occurrence). It doesn't stop at a simple interest, which is acceptable in this situation; it is a wild addiction that turns her into a first-class whore every time she is in contact with Kouta. Speaking of Kouta, I have never seen a more useless male lead, one that is easily molded by anything that flies in his direction, like grains of sand or the common housefly. He also objects to Chizuru's physical affection, but why is it that at the end of the series, he can finally muster up the courage to say he loves her? I'm pretty sure down the line, he gave up and allowed Chizuru to have her way with him, however the hell that's about to happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe support cast are somehow the most appealing characters in this entire show, with the exception of the antagonists. The antagonists make just as much sense as the main cast, who will set the stage for a fight for a few reasons: to declare love for no good reason, to test someone for no good reason, or to pick a fight for no good reason. One of the antagonists that picks a fight tries to take Chizuru from Kouta, and after he is hit with one energy beam, he packs up and leaves as if nothing happened because he is a cowardly pretty boy who was more worried about the smudge on his leather coat than losing the girl he \"likes\" to a 6th grade kid. Another spirit comes along, begins attacking Chizuru, and after trading one or two blows, she leaves and says, \"oh, I was just testing you.\" What's the point of that? If I wanted to test something, I'd just become a teacher and hand out tests to everyone that walks into the classroom. The last couple just attacks them. Why? Why would you want to attack someone without any reason? \"Oh yes, it would be fun, wouldn't it-\" come off it already. Now you're just confirming your stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I mentioned above that this is a fantasy show. Fantasy shows generally come with action. Kanokon, unfortunately, has fighting sequences. Why is it unfortunate? Because fight sequences stop themselves halfway before finishing. Each of the antagonists flee halfway through the battle, and this paves the stage for multiple anti-climactic sequences, which become quite tedious to watch. Maybe I'm expecting too much from an ecchi show, but what if I compared it to a show like Omamori Himari? That's a harem with ecchi scenes AND action, and they pulled it off correctly. Why couldn't Kanokon do it? Or rather, what blender did you use to screw up this show so badly, and what setting was it on?\\n\\n\r\nAs always, I'm only a fan of ecchi in moderation. Since I'm not the type of guy to enjoy shows filled to the brim with fan service, I'll have to let you decide that for yourself; do you watch for the plot or do you watch for the plot?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Believe it or not, I have a least favorite anime that's not called Kanokon. Despite all that I can say about this show, I would still watch it in front of Air Gear, which would be as rock bottom as rock bottom gets for me, unless another show wants to take its place. Sure, it avoided being one of my most disliked shows, but it's still much closer to the bottom of my list than it is to the top. I do know that shows have potential to reach greater heights if they would just throw out a good number of useless elements, but Kanokon lacks any of that potential. There's no story, the characters are flimsy pushovers, and fan service has always been a useless addition to any show. I know a good number of people out there enjoyed it much more than I did, but Kanokon isn't just a bad show. It's a bad show with a fanbase. \\n\\n\r\nI don't mind if you took my words and said, \"oh, I'm watching this show anyways.\" In fact, I couldn't care less what you did with your time just as long as it doesn't cut into mine. But there are only two paths you can take with this show: love it and dismiss every word of offense towards this show or hate it and end up realizing that you wasted a good chunk of your time watching bad characters look like they're about to do something.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a note to the writers: next time you want to blend something, I recommend that you use my personal choice, the Vita-Mix 5000. It juices everything in the cup fairly well and the end result is a delicious smoothie.",

            "content": "As my first review, I'll try to keep from rambling on, but I'll give an honest opinion. Why not start with one of the most borderline-jumping ecchi/hentai animes I've yet seen?\r\nWhen I first came across this series, I watched the first episode looking for comedy, and a bit of ecchi. Funny, random, so on. I saw the first episode, and I have to say I was struck dumb. I had not yet seen an ecchi that so closely bordered hentai, with all its sexual innuendo, panty shots, and basically only covering the details that would make it hentai. Fanservice here, fanservice there, fanservice everywhere. Puttingthat aside, the anime is pretty funny, and rather spontaneous, so I was not bored at any time.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nNot exactly original, and development of the backstory is completely absent. That being said the story isn't cliche, just not anything new. Having so many random things happen, plus three girls trying to get all over the main protagonist (Kouta), not too original either, but at least it wasn't absolutely junk.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art:\\n\r\nAt the beginning, it's more &quot;cartoonish&quot; approach to traditonal shojo style isn't too bad, but I really could do without the extremely blushed cheeks that make it seem they're always drunk. But everything is drawn with style and a bit of flair, so it doesn't turn me off too much. (No pun intended) Throughout the series, I noticed a lot of dawn/dusk scenes that blew out my screen with so many yellows and oranges that I got quite sick of it. Otherwise, the majority of scenes are well made and smooth.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOP was pretty well put, ED was a bit annoying. The soundtrack throughout the anime was well set, but to me, it only aids in the projection of the anime to the viewer, so I usually only notice it if its a piece I already know, if its terrible, or if it's a freakin' masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters aren't built up past a few flashbacks and some obvious character traits. There isn't much backstory to speak of, and for good reason.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nComedy comes in weird forms, and if insane amounts of sexual innuendo and the like make me laugh, then I enjoyed it. Lots of random and completely unexpected little jokes helped with this score.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nExpect the closest thing to hentai without it being hentai. I'm sure that's a tired thing to say now, but there is no other way to describe the series. However, do expect laughs and a good time if you like a bit of ecchi/harem with comedy. It's remarkably short and a bit of a joke if you're looking for something deeper, so do not expect too much.",

            "content": "Oh god, When I first heard of this show, I thought that it would be different. Why did I even think it was going to be different? The characters are perverted, and act strangely odd.\r\nThe story goes way to fast, bringing up more questions then answers. All the story is becomes a love triangle with a short little kid in the middle of it. This is pretty much Hentai without the sex. It\u2019s messed up and would be much better if they just used the sex in order to have a more interesting story line. AND THERE IS NO ENDING! It gives us a \u2018readthe manga\u2019 ending that always pisses me off. If I wanted to read the manga, I would of done so already or read it instead of watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nChizuru is a really interesting girl who is really hangs onto Kouta all the time. She is extremely pushy and keeps wanting him to go out with her. All this teasing really pushes him from her all the time. It also seems that all the time, she ends up trying to sleep with him. When she shows that she\u2019s a fox, he actually for some reason doesn\u2019t care much. Then we have the problem with him falling in love with her slightly. There is also the fact that he and her end up becoming one whenever they kiss and she wants to be with him. Nozomu doesn\u2019t seem to have much personality in the beginning but and always seems to act like a love rival.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters rarely have any personality out of just a standard archy types with not much of a story behind how they act. The characters are all 2 Dimensional. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the show actually got better as it went on, and around the 4th episode, it actually got a lot better artwork and the voices weren\u2019t as stale. It feels like they got into the show more. Not only that but I believe it was the 5th episode where my favorite character was introduced. To bad he only stayed for one episode though. I really liked Saku Ezomori.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the beginning is pretty standard as well as the animation. It pretty much has a loneliness walking style to it and showing the characters. And then somehow, the main character turning into a \u2018fox boy\u2019 for some strange reason. The animation is really butt ugly in many aspects for the background characters, making them lose much detail. The main characters may be detailed in a sense but the personality is really bland. \\n\\n\r\nThe voices\u2026 dear god the voices\u2026 They messed them all up. Chizuru is really high voiced and can probably hurt my ears. Kouta sounds like a little child, not like he would be in the same grade as all the other characters. The script is a bit choppy and again really doesn\u2019t explain much. Sometimes the script is delivered without much feeling. Also some of the lip sinks are bad, they don\u2019t work right.\\n",

However, I'm rating Kanokon first, so I hope my review doesn't sound too cynical. Here goes.\r\nThere's really -no- story to this anime. The only thing I managed to get out of it was a bit of arousal. But I suppose that's why they call it ecchi. It's borderline hentai, in my opinion. I think I saw up Chizuru's skirt over one hundred times. But seriously. It was really pushed to the limit to the point where it wasn't even entertaining when ithappened. The flashing was just too common. Fanservice is nice, but there's a point where enough is enough. This is definitely NOT a family anime. Hide this. Far away. Out of sight.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Kouta, looks like he's in preschool. Yeah. I said preschool. And his eyes are ridiculously... large... and... and well. Yeah. It's bothersome. He would have looked better with a bag on his head. And then you have Chizuru who, surprise surprise, falls in love with Kouta. But what would any anime be without the rival? As a result, you then have Nozomu, clinging to Kouta nearly just as much as Chizuru. Throughout this whole anime, you're probably asking yourself why you're watching this. I'm surprised I didn't just toss this halfway through. Maybe it's because I'm perverted. Yeah, actually, that's probably it. Oh, did I mention, Chizuru and Nozomu are spirits? Yep. A fox and wolf spirit to be exact. Sounds cool, but it really doesn't affect the anime too much. My favorite character ended up being Tayura, probably because he was one of the more normal characters. But that's enough of that. The characters were mediocre at best, and whenever I watched Nozomu, I swear she reminded me of Yuki Nagato from The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya. XP Probably because she was the silent type. OH WELL.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is one of those things that you'll end up liking, or end up hating. I'll give it an award for maintaining an \"ecchi\" label, even though most of the show, you're listening to perverted comments, and watching Chizuru push Kouta into her breasts so she can, lol, \"spoil him.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for fanservice, this is it. It's just so blatant that it's IMPOSSIBLE to miss. Just don't expect too much out of this one.",

            "content": "My first review heads up.\r\nStory: 3\r\nWhile lacking any real meta story (other than maybe the last two episodes), the story of each episode is what's important. However no real character development happen during these episodes and nothing really affects the overall series. If you like a series with story Kanokon is not for you.\r\nArt:6\r\nThere isn't much to say about the art. The character designs are pretty generic, even the \"spirit form\" of the main character. However it is fairly fluid and there aren't any major animation kerfuffles.\r\nSound: 5\r\nAgain not really a lot to say. The OP and ED are pretty unmemorable. I tended to skippast them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nThis is where the series really takes a nosedive. The rule of \"status quo is god\" seems to be in effect here. The events of one episode tend not to affect the characters in a later episode. With this there is little-to-no character development. The characters seem to be exactly the same, and be acting the exact same way in the first episode as the last episode. I found the supporting characters to be egregious and more than anything annoying, with one exception (the twins). The main characters themselves are extremely annoying. Kouta, the male lead, has very little personality other than the fact that he looks like an elementary student and is extremely passive to the sexual abuse he endures throughout the series. Chizuru is the aggressive and horny 400 year old fox spirit, she spends most of her time obsessing over Kouta, to the point where when she thought she couldn't be with him sexually she was willing to die. Nozomu is the more passive, and less sexual but still aggressive foil to Chizuru. She spends most of the series playing \"raised by wolves\" antics, interrupting Chizuru's \"naughty\" plans for Kouta at the worst time, and trying to match (and failing) Chizuru's sexual abuse of Kouta.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nThis is where people may differ. If you enjoy ecchi anime then there is the possibility you'll enjoy Kanokon. However if you're looking for a series with more than just fanservice then this is likely to disappoint you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nWhile I didn't particularly enjoy this. Others may find this less than not enjoyable. I don't recommend this for anyone looking for a \"good\" show to watch. However if you're a fan of ecchi and fanservice this is just the show for you, and that's okay.",

Personally...I don't mind episode-by-episode Anime (if you can call this that, it's borderline) so long as it's obvious..which it is. I'm easily entertained to say the least.\r\nArt: 3\r\nI'm not particularly a fan of not matching the setting. They are High School students. Kouta and Nozomu look like they're 5. Chizuru is the one that fits the model in my opinion, problem is, it makes her appear as a total pedophile given the art style. 17 year old looking girl trying to have aggressive sexual relations with whatlooks like a 5 year old child.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nLackluster to say the least...that's about all my input on that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nHOLY CRAP...after the first episode all I wanted to do is slug the stupid out of this Kouta guy, hate him. They draw him like a 5 year old, he sounds like a 5 year old, and he seems to be absolutely terrified of anything that a kid in the 6th grade would go nuts over. He reacts to this horny big titted, good looking girl that wants every bit of him, as if she were some horrid disease. The absolute most hopeless of men would be all over that. If they at least DREW him a little bit different and gave him an older voice, I wouldn't be as upset...but would still be pissed at his total phobic aversion to the opposite sex.\\n\\n\r\nChizuru is probably the only likable character given obvious reasons. Good looking, obviously looking for some, and sweet. Did I mention her assets? The only issue is, is that they portray her as a pedophile in my eyes given the fact that Kouta looks like a 5 year old. Any other guy she did this to and it would have been fine. A good example would be how Kurumu and Tsukune from R+V interacted with each other.....that's what would be acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nNozomu is just as bad as Kouta in a similar but different way. She looks and sounds like a little kid as well...while she's not supposed to be. Making characters look and sound that damned young while they're supposed to be in High School is just, grossly miss-portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nAkane is just terribly annoying...all I want to do is tell her to piss the hell off. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nThis is probably the first time I've gotten angry at an Anime. The main character is an absolute panzy. I despise looking at him and hearing his voice when he's matched up with Chizuru. The ecchi can't even be funny based on the way he reacts.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nI'm not really going to repeat what was said to wrap this up. It had potential to be better with a few artwork and character adjustments, it wouldn't help by much, but it's just really, really, bad as it stands.",

            "content": "Before I begin, I'd like to say something for the record. I have no idea what you want from me when you ask me to rank a show's \"sound\". If I can hear it, that's fine by me, and a show's audio would have to be truely horrid for me to say anything against it. Now, on to Kanokon.\r\nFirst off, the sound is utterly fantastic ; P\r\nSeriously though, apart from having a nice rhythmic title, there's little to say for this show other than the obvious. The character designs are attractive (aesthetically as well as... well, you know), and it's just as well that theoverall animation is shiny and crisp. The animators do love them some still shots, though, as the viewer takes a trip down memory lain to the sights of immobile children, forever on their way to school. And if you think the male protagonist's eyes are unsettlingly large, then join the club.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the show is every bit as contrived as it has a rite to be... arguably more so. It's your standard &quot;fling with otherworldly beings&quot; excuse for some good oldfashioned fanservice, with some particularly stunning kiss scenes, courtesy of the aformentioned animation. The show suffers from the same affliction as all those that came before it: all the relaxed campiness is eventually bogged down by pointless drama. Not to give anything away, but there's pretty much nobody in this show who wants the two main characters to get together, or at least is willing to let them do so without a fight. I understand that true love must overcome obstacles, but this is a show about fox spirits hitting on prepubescent high schoolers; the realism ship has already sailed, you can stop swimming after it.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the episodes where the focus is on silly romps and startling degrees of fanservice tease (seriously, not an episode goes by where you &quot;think&quot; you saw something) are the best, because they most successfully attain a certain aspect that Kanokon is striving for. The drama bits are bearable at best (if only because they lead back around to said silly romps and fanservice) and frustrating at worst (more so than said false starts in gratuity). It's not bad by any means, but don't expect any sort of satisfying narrative out of this show (it's only 12 episodes long, for pete's sake! Minami-ke managed 13 easy, and it had less plot than a shoe). Kanokon is the chocolate Easter bunny of anime: sweet and cute on the outside but inevitably hollow (and there's more where that came from as I'm sure you already know).\\n\\n\r\nAlso, having just read back over this, I'd like to apologize for my rampant use of parenthesis. I promise I'll work on that.",

            "content": "Once, my friend came over and brought the first disc of this anime in a bag he always had with him. The cover entailed two topless women with tails sexually attacking what you could assume was the main character. The cover art was screaming \"don't watch me.\" Regardless, I was curious, so I began watching it anyway just to see what it was about, why the cover was so risque, and to see exactly how terrible it was. This is probably the third worst anime I've ever seen, the second being the Chrono Trigger OVA and the first being Mars of Destruction. Anybody who givesthis a higher score than a seven has serious mental issues. My friend gave it an eight. I'm going to start with the most painful aspect of this trash: The storyline.\\n\\n\r\nStory:4\\n\\n\r\nI don't even think they were trying. They probably assumed it was enough to simply, yet forcefully, create another \"sexy\" anime, walk away, and never speak of it again. \\n\\n\r\nA storyline is pretty much the most important thing in an anime,  or any other form of entertainment media with special exceptions given to music and videogames. Most of this piece of crap just shows Chizuru's unwanted sexual advances toward Kouta.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning is especially horrible. Kouta's walking on some bridge and glances toward Chizuru. Then the theme song plays. After you watch that, Chizuru is hopelessly in love with Kouta. No explanation at all. The entire first episode is a pretty awkward introduction besides.\\n\\n\r\nLater, you're introduced to something similar to an antagonist. They exist for what, two episodes? After they get in and cause some mischief, they mysteriously leave right after Kouta rips off Rosario and Vampire.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Nozomu's very existence is pointless. She's supposed to be a rival to Chizuru, but she... well, she doesn't do much. Her affection towards Kouta doesn't really affect the plot. They could pretty much have made this entire anime without her aside from the moments introducing her and one episode later in the series having to do with a love potion.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending isn't especially horrible, but it isn't great either.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the story is just about Chiziru and some trivial problems she has in winning Kouta's love. That's about it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nAnimation doesn't really matter to me. If it moves, I can accept it. That said, Kanokon's animation is pretty impressive, with lots of movement and few, if any, screw ups. Art's nice, too. All I could say about that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nNothing good, nothing bad, and I sort of slightly like the theme song. I've entirely forgotten the ending theme. Gets a six.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nFor me, this is a pretty controversial element. While some characters are terrible, others are enigmatic and interesting. The best character by far is Tayura, who I found so enjoyable that I actually added him to my \"Favorite Characters\" list. Tayura has a slightly stronger role in the story than other support characters, which is fortunate. The other support characters are also pretty nice, even if they're only archtypes. As I said before, Nozomu, a rip-off of Nagato and Rei, has no real reason to be in this series. And if you watched Evangelion and hated Shinji (I believe Shinji is actually fantastic) you will hate Kouta, who whines ten times as much. Or maybe it just seems that way because his voice is so high. He isn't a character in truth, but a plot device. He has no redeeming qualities, which will either make you think \"Ha! if this guy can have a personal harem, then I can at least get laid!\" or \"God, even that guy can get a girlfriend and I can't? Why am I so hopeless?\" In other words, it will either give you confidence or depress you terribly. I am a part of the latter group who wants Kouta to get eaten by a bear. He's the worst character I have ever seen. Chizuru is okay, too, but she's also just an archtype.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nHow could such a terrible anime have an enjoyment level of seven? Because it is, in fact, pretty fun to watch. Only a few of the jokes are particularly funny and I'm going to skip over the excessive fanservice entirely. However, the ways the characters react to situation after situation is undeniably enjoyable. Although the characters aren't good in the truest sense (except for Tayura, who always manages to be awesome in some way or other) each of them is used effectively and the entire series does have a distinctive charm. I think I would actually recommend Kanokon to somebody if I was a lesser man. The writers, admittedly, have created a pretty entertaining, if not truly funny, script.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't an anime you should scour the internet for. In fact, it'd probably be better for you short term, and the anime industry long term, if you just walked away. I'd compare this anime to drugs, I suppose, and that's neither a compliment nor insult, but a fact. If you watch it, you might like it, even though I'm warning you that it really is pretty bad. If this is your thing, though, go ahead.\\n\\n\r\nRezindez,\\n\r\n         The Immortal Crow",

Meek little men that look like they'd lose in an armwrestle with a hamster would be getting all the attention from strong overconfident women. I shit you not, the \"male lead\" here squeals like a weasel and apologises to his deceased grandfather every time girls try to initiate sexual contact with him. I've never been so fucking rustled in my entire life. \r\nThe plot... there isn't any. Just one weak boy that was probably manufactured with a flaccid dick and a horde of one dimensional nymphos. They force themselves on him,he starts looking like a rotten tomato and runs away screaming some shit about his grandfather and how immoral sexual activities are. Rinse and repeat - whole 12 episodes. I had to light up a joint and pretend he's just playing hard to get to avoid slamming my monitor against the wall every time he went full retard. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was decent however and I imagine this would be the only reason why anyone in their right mind would ever want to watch this perversion of natural selection - ecchi fanservice. There are nicely animated tits and asses in every episode for your viewing pleasure but if that's all you're looking for... just look up hentai. Saves you the headache of wading through this apocalyptic disaster of a \"plot\". \\n\\n\r\nThe sound & OST were horrid at best. The male lead sounds like a castrated chipmunk with guilt issues and the females squirt over his skinny pale ass like he's mandingo. The music will make your ears bleed and the OP & ED themes like the ones here have been confirmed to be the cause of erectile dysfunction in young men across the world. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - there is none. This shit will infuriate any man or woman. It doesn't matter what you believe or where you hail from - this anime is a rape of the natural balance of nature we observe everyday. \\n\\n\r\nWasted best bud to try to get through this. I'm being extremely lenient when I give this steaming turd 2 points only on the merit of good art.",

            "content": "Oh boy Ero King Kouta is one lucky dude, nothing like getting down with the furries or monster girls whichever, but you got to envy this guy a bit I mean how many small loli-type boys you see with bodacious or in this case boobdacious extremelly horny girl fox, yokai erm thing whatever.. This is the epotome of ecchiness! Maybe its not High School DxD ecchiness, but it is up there, and sometimes wonder why in the heck there isn't a h-scene I mean they've gotten pretty close to it multiple time (I'm only speaking about the anime of course, not including the manga justincase someone says \"but there is sort of one\"). Anyways going back let me get this review started!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 \\n\r\nThe story of a young country boy named Kouta who attends a city high school for the first time, who ends up meeting a lovely, curvacious girl named Chizuru. Of course she has a secret and shares to Kouta instantaniously. She is no other than a Yellow, White tail Yokai Fox, who just happens to be over 400 years old but only looks like a 16 year old girl of course. However the story basically goes of as a somewhat forbidden-fruitful love that begins unrequited and blossoms to both party feeling mutual, of course cause love between a Human and a Yokai its deemed unworthy and an abomination in the Yokai world, groups of yokai try to test their fate, and see if their love is truly a pure and blissful love.. As they fight side by side together or in this case inside of each other, they prove countless times that their love is strong and can overcome any obstacle! Pretty clich\u00e9 if you ask me.. Why not call it Romeo & Juliet with monsters and no suicide.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nArt style wasn't really eye catching, it could've been better but then again being a product from xebec you expect no less, it's still watchable and for it to be released in 2008 of course the animation well be a different taste compared to the anime of today of course, so in this case its falls to the fact that improvement in animation throughout the years makes this into something not really appealing, but if you watched it when it first released 6 years then, then the art would've been refreshing, however compare to other anime release that same year by other companies, that ended up looking better you might not feel the same way in this one. So in the end it just falls under preference.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nOk this category is going to be attacked a bit, but then again maybe I got to take under consiteration that I watched this on English dubbed and not in Japanese. So I'm going to let that slide out of unfairness, however the sound affects will not be given that sort of treatment. Honestly it felt like the recording was made on a motorola razor from 2005, it sounded so bland, and cheezy, even in the fights where you espected to be epic it just lets you down, and the background music (ost) didn't really match up right nor fits this anime.. The opening and ending is another preference, it can be considered catchy then again to some it may not, but how this anime is the opening was nicely upbeat and in touch to how the series goes so it was a good choice of theme, however the ending was a bit unmatched, especially the musician rapid singing towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters were well rounded, enjoyable they each had those little nicks and crooks that made it entertaining to watch, and seeing the difference between Kouta and Chizuru was refreshing. Of course Kouta still falls under that accidental pervet who gets flusttered easily harem type king, so he is no exception, but the difference is he isn't totally useless. One thing is being there to being the keystone of another person power, and another is that the other person and you have to merge together to unleash true power, while its still perform as a kiss most male characters sit on the sideline and watch on, but in this case not Kouta he's on the front line and that was takes him apart from the typical harem king. As for Chizuru her character is the same as most in-loved female character who have an obsession to their love interest and does whatever to please him (where in the hell are these girls in real life???). All jokes aside the characters are lovable besides Asahina she's a prude!!(fyi that's just my opinion haha).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 6\\n\r\nIt gave me an awkward.... Whoa there buddy lets not, well it made me red, with embarrassement with such bold acts so it was a bit awkward only cause I kept forgetting Kouta was alot older than I thought. But yes seriously this was enjoyable because of the humor, why isn't it a 10 then? Cause the action scenes kind of killed it and the obvious scenes of course even though there weren't many but like I said it has your typical anime moments this anime is no exception.. However Nozomu killed me with the \"hey look its cake\" ah Nozomu even though you're a dandere girl, you really were hilarious in the moments you were focused on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nAll you ecchi, monster girl lover if you haven't watched this or planning on to, and you're only interested in the \"plot\" then by all mean go right ahead and watch it. For those who are into soft touched humor will a little of the perversion then give it a go, and for those into forbidden love that is tested and then conquered the once again give it a go.. If you're not into any of these things I mentioned then understand that your enjoyement of this anime will differ greatly and will probably cause you to hate yourself.. Not really but you won't find it that enjoyable but before knocking it down give it the 3 episode go if after 3 episode you don't see yourself watching it till the end then drop it, like I said overall this anime is rated average so don't expect to much out of it, beside petty enjoyement.\\n\\n\r\n*Readers note\\n\r\n1.My experience of this does not reflect the rating so for me this was a bit boring and slow but for the review sake I but my personal opinion aside.\\n\\n\r\n2. Fanservice is not and I repeat is not only when boobs and h-scene are showned that is a miscompception.. Fanservice is when the author of the series, or the producer of the anime incorporates the fan's opinion into the show.. Do not confuse ecchiness with fanservice as they are 2 different things, sometimes it can be mixed when fans demand more ecchiness in the anime/manga and the producer takes that into account. So once again quit mixing the 2 up.",

            "content": "I won't lie to you, I watched this primarily for the ecchi scenes and fanservice. So, did I get what I wanted?\r\nI read some people's comments and reviews about Kanokon being borderline hentai, with lots of nudity, so I was intrigued. Well... can't say I was satisfied.\r\nFirst, expect most of the ecchi harem stereotypes here. We have a main character who's pretty bland, and has two hot chicks throwing themselves at his feet. Does he react? No, of course not. He's constantly embarrassed by them shoving their boobs in his face. Additionally, the two chicks are yokais - one has fox powers, and the otherone has wolf powers.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also a few side characters, but most of them were forgettable. The only side characters I liked were the redhead twins. Some of the scenes with them reminded me of classic Looney Tunes cartoons. There were also some one-time characters (mostly villains), and they were above average.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay but nothing special. Same goes for the sound.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what I wanted to see most here were ecchi scenes and nudity. Okay, to be fair, there were many ecchi scenes, boob grabbing and playing, panty shots etc. But the actual nudity was, in my opinion, scarce.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the ending was bland and anti-climactic, too.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this anime is really nothing special. Watch it if you like ecchi, teasing, boob play, and other standard ecchi stuff. But if you're looking for a deeper story, character development and something more than just two yokai chicks obsessing over a clueless main characters, avoid Kanokon.",

            "content": "Frankly I'm not sure what possessed me to even start this series. I was first exposed to this style of anime right after I graduated high school with Love Hina. I'll admit, a little guiltily I might add, that I found it rather fun and entertaining. However it started to wear out rather fast and it didn't take long before I was avoiding anything remotely similar. Don't get me wrong, there isn't anything necessarily wrong with wanting to watch perverted harem anime... it's just not for me.\r\n\tAnd in comes Kanokon. I thought, \" Hey, it's been a few years, let's give it another try andsee what happens\". Oh boy.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe plot revolves around Kouta Oyamada, a new first-year high school student not quite used to the 'big city'. He quickly meets Chizuru, a second-year student who falls in love at first sight with Kouta on the first day of school. And here is the kicker... she is a fox spirit. In fact there are a lot of spirits masquerading as humans and for some unknown reason going to high school. Go figure. Chizuru is what any protagonists love interest should be in a harem ecchi anime; that is a big-chested horny no personality woman who is older than the main, but only just barely so. There are other people as well, including a horny wolf spirit and a slew of easily forgettable characters whom you will have no real connection with... unless you believe your animal spirit is in heat. Seek immediate medical attention if that is the case.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere wasn't even time to prepare for this disaster as it jumps right in without even really trying to setup any kind of back story. Now I can adapt to different styles of storytelling just fine without pause but it just left me feeling like they just wanted to get to the TnA as soon as possible. It's the bread and butter of shows like this and I can understand that the segment of anime viewers they are shooting for want that, but wow is it just blatant. And the main character looks like a child, which in itself is disturbing. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe quality of the animation was average, which isn't saying much. It doesn't pop out at you, and tends to use the same clich\u00e9 faces and actions. Nothing really surprising as again the demographic this is keyed for isn't necessarily as concerned about the quality as the quantity, *cough*ofbreasts*cough*. \\n\\n\r\n\tI know this is a rather negative review for a score of 5; that it should have probably been a lower score. I Can't fault anyone on thinking that. However once everything is put together, in concert with one another, it's more than the sum of its parts. Not much more. Let's not get carried away now. If you like ecchi harem anime add +2 to the score. Otherwise, go watch something else. \\n",

Hurr.\r\nMarks for going farther in terms of (lewd) action than any other fanservice (or even some hentai) anime though.\r\nART\r\nYou have to give credit to Kanokon - the animation and production is great. Every curve is well-proportioned, every line is drawn nicely, every oily glean off the skin polished to perfection. Adds to the realism of the fanservice, which is always welcome to, ahem, fans of this genre.\r\nSOUND\r\nWell, the girls make great sounds.\r\nTo be honest thoughthe VAs aren't that committed, and it shows, if subtly. I wouldn't blame them.\\n\r\nBGM doesn't stand out at all. Neither do the songs.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nShota. Bigboob foxgirl. DFC wolfgirl. Wincest. Etc.\\n\r\nWell there's some half-decent character development at least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'd have to mark it down in this area more than I thought I'd have to. It turns out there can be too much fanservice for its own good, even if it's made for it. The absolutely delightful (some would prefer obscene) limits the fanservice pushes leave little to no imagination, which could turn off people from looking for doujins, while ensuring blue balls at the same time. Blue balls and no desire for doujins. Not a good combination.\\n\r\nStill it's great fun watching and wondering how far the producers would go. And learning wonderful news, like this anime being the favourite among Japan's elementary school kids. Who'd have thought.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nSometimes a whackball just comes along and hits you in the face (or balls for some). Turns out this season's came from the fanservice field.\\n\r\nWell hey it's fun watching the moral crusaders among us wiggle uncomfortably, while we f*p and laugh to the fanservice. For that I'd give it an extra point, and make it a 6, for making it the standout rose among the defloweries of its genre.",

So if you are the first time to watch Echi shows, better not watch this one first...\r\nAbout the story: Mythically... yet horrifically funny.  Imagine Naruto 9 tail fox in sexy jutsu...  That's where you get the female character.  But this is just sexy all the way.  The thing I'mnot particularly like is the transformation.  It is not Sailor moon-ish, but it is rather like wierd...\\n\\n\r\nHowever, you gotta love the characters: It is like a preschoolers about to have sex with a high school student...  Even if that preschooler is actually a HIGH SCHOOL student!!!  That is the funniest part.  \\n\\n\r\nDrawing I would say pretty typical...  But if you are a perverted type of guy with nonsense mind...  You would love it.  Just don't go nosebleed everytime you watch the show...",

This anime is one that gave me the motivation to start my adventure in search to watch all romance animes. Okay lets start. Kouta a little country boy who lived with his grandfather but comes to the city. Right of the bat we get Chizuru the youkai fox who falls in love with him. I really liked this anime because it does the opposite of what most anime do today, which leads people to say things like\"I'm tired of waiting the whole season just for the main characters to say \"I like you\" which is usually at the end of every anime and we never get to see what happens after that. Kanokon gets straight to the point and let her know she loves him. There is fan service but what anime does not have fan service. The only bad thing I shall say was wrong is that the main protag was being gay and not wanting to get with Chizuru. However, all anime are like that.",

            "content": "Originally, I had never heard of Kanokon and would never have touched it, if not for the MAL recommendation system.  Being in the mood for another slice of life romantic comedy, I quickly acquired the series for viewing.  It's a nice short adaptation of the Light Novels of the same name.\r\nDespite the fanservice, Kanokon has some semblance of a plot.  Here, we follow the [mis]adventures of little Kouta as he faces perils of many kinds.  Now at first it seems quite episodic, something with meat in the episodes themselves with a little continuity from one to the next.  Unfortunately, ittrips up in the later episodes with the school siege which at that point seemed like the great place to end the anime ona good note, we get a few more episodes.  Now the actual ending of the anime maintains the status quo and wraps up nicely, it competes with the earlier action packed battle at school and leaves me with a bad impression.  The writers really should have known better, especially this being an adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the art goes, it does a great job at remaining inconsistent.  The animations shift from mediocre to surprisingly good at key moments and usually during actions scenes as well.  That's not to say the Kanokon is mediocre in its art.  In fact, it does a fine job of nailing down the setting and characters (and the Gainaxing).  It's just the way the animation shifts from time to time ticks me off.  I really wished they could have kept up the standard throughout the series but I would understand if the producers could not due to various reasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special though.  Most scenes are given adequate accompaniments.  I emphasise on most scenes since I feel some scenes would be better off with another type of song in the background, particularly the penultimate fight at school.  However, as far as sound effects go, they do go out of their way to emphasise whatever is happening on screen, so props to them.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, for our [arguably] beloved cast of characters, it seems only the Kouta and Chizuru seem to possess an adequate measure of development.  A pity, since the supposed rival, Nozomu, seems akin to an accessory by comparison.  It doesn't help that she's also an emotionless girl that is eerily resemblant of another quite famous quiet type I know just without the same level of depth.  Of our supporting cast, we have some small going ons here and there, but some of them are quite random, revealed, resolved and/or unexplained until the very end or near it.  That's passable because the focus seems to be on the main couple that is Kouta and Chizuru.  Kouta has his moments, readily manning up to make it through the crises.  Chizuru on the other hand, is just quite stubborn and as a sibling puts it, simple-minded.  Though that doesn't stop her from her wholehearted devotion and leading poor little Kouta on.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, the silliness of it all gives way to some measure of enjoyment.  It could be the first time that Kouta and Chizuru show off some power, or it could the various fight scenes, or the Fanservice (with a capital F).  Quite an enjoyable show, if you're looking for something nice and light without too much depth to it.  However, if you have a tendency to nosebleed from anything risqu\u00e9, or if you just don't need/like fanservice, or you're not in to little boys, you might want to sign this one off.",

            "content": "This is my first review for my anime list\r\nIf this is part of your review I apologize there really is not much else I can say that people already said about this anime. This was one of the worst anime I have ever seen in my life, I can't believe I sat through this piece of crap twice; I wasted so much of my life watching this. Ok fan service is one thing but this anime is closer to hentai so it is a completely different thing.\r\nHow to start this off\r\nStory: Since ecchis usually do not have a plot, I was not expecting much. Nevertheless,the plot of this anime was bad even for ecchis standards. If you want something better watch Omamori Himari, it is an ecchi also but is better overall in all categories. I will also go on record as saying that this anime did have some decent potential where they could probably use the fusion between Kohta and Chizuru to a much favorable thing where they fight villains. But no they had to muck it up by drowning the anime completely with useless, annoying, and indecent fan service. Seriously, I would rather watch Dragon Ball Evolution. It was a crappy movie, but at least it had a point and premise. This \"anime\" is as close to hentai as humanly possible. \\n\r\nSound: The OP is a pretty good song, I like Phosphor. I can't really pick on the sound much; I did not find any real problems. \\n\\n\r\nArt: There is only one thing I hate about the art; they made Kohta look like a 10 year old boy. I like the eyes, also the anime is very colorful, and it does not look depressing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh am I going to have fun with this. I am just focusing on the main characters, because too many of the supporting characters stink.\\n\\n\r\nChizuru Minamoto: This character is a slut, she is so desperate to be screwed, and it is not even funny. According to the Wikipedia page it says that she like to dress erotically for Kohta, when they are alone. Not much I can say.  She does have a personality which is more than I can say about other characters in this piece of crap series. I do have a feeling that she is a pedophile because of how she is with Kohta. The only cool thing that Chizuru does is merging with Kohta, because I do like the way he looks.\\n\\n\r\nNozomu Ezomori: This character has no emotions or personality to think of. Like Chizuru, she is a very slutty character. She tries to find every opportunity to be with Kohta. For me she stoops to a new low by having \\n\r\nKohta drink the nine tail drink, an energy drink for yokai, where the side effect is the people drinking it fall in love with the other person, which makes Kohta fall in love with Nozomu. She is one of the many characters in the show who has no personality to their name.\\n\\n\r\nKohta Oyamada: Oh, am I going to go to town with this one. First of all, I am going to go on record and say he is the worst protagonist I have ever seen in my life. I would not have had much of a problem with him if they would have drawn him out to be older. This child should grow some balls, and grow up. Also he should go down the halls of any middle school nowadays and see what the couples are doing. His grandpa is not with him so he should shut up about it and stop lingering on his past, it is so annoying. This guy (using that term loosely) is too childish to have these girls chasing him around.",

            "content": "Kanokon's story revolves around Kouta Okayama, a young first-year high school student who moves from the country to the city and thus transfers to Kunpo High School. On his first day at his new school, a beautiful second-year female student named Chizuru Minamoto asks him to meet her alone in the music room. When he arrives, she reveals that she is in fact a fox deity and from that day on the two hang out together. Nozomu is a first year female student at Kouta's school, she is in fact a wolf deity and in love with Kouta, and a rival of Chizuru for Kouta'saffections. (Taken from ANN)\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to say this now, Kanokon is a super ecchi/fan service anime but, for those two reasons, this show was pretty damn funny. I haven't laughed this hard in a pretty long time. I should also mention this show is NOT for kids what so ever. You see breasts, panties, and other stuff through out the entire show that are not intended for kids.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main characters, Chizuru, is in love with Kouta. During the course of the show Chizuru does many perverted things to him. While he likes it, he always resists it because he thinks it's wrong. While Chizuru starts doing these things to Kouta, the other students at their school give Kouta the nickname \"The Great Erotic King\". That's just one of the many goofy/erotic things during the show. Another great thing that adds to the comedy was the writing. I thought the writing was very funny and entertaining. I laughed through out the show. Every single episode made me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all, the show was very enjoyable. While it's super ecchi and fan service, I just thought it was very funny. The comedy of the show is what drew me in (and maybe the ecchi stuff :P). If you love ecchi/fan service stuff, you will probably love this series. And yes, this is better than 'To Love-RU' series.....Waiting for haters....",

This is an ecchi which provides that classic out-of-this-world nudity which occurs under the stupidest reasons, but if you're watching as an ecchi lover, this is the Picasso of ecchi.\r\nBUT, like I have said for so many other ecchi, remember that the somewhat favorable plot will disappear slowly, and only rear it's head every so often to introduce new characters. As for the ending...well...um...er..let's just say if you've seen an ecchi anime before, you probably know what kind of ending your in for.\r\nIgive this an 8/10 because it was an ecchi that remained ecchiful and didn't strangle itself to death with a crappy plot.",

            "content": "Kanokon's story revolves around Kouta Okayama, a young first-year high school student who moves from the country to the city and thus transfers to Kunpo High School. On his first day at his new school, a beautiful second-year female student named Chizuru Minamoto asks him to meet her alone in the music room. When he arrives, she reveals that she is in fact a fox deity and from that day on the two hang out together. Nozomu is a first year female student at Kouta's school, she is in fact a wolf deity and in love with Kouta, and a rival of Chizuru for Kouta'saffections. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to say this now, Kanokon is a super ecchi/fan service anime but, for those two reasons, this show was pretty damn funny. I haven't laughed this hard in a pretty long time. I should also mention this show is NOT for kids what so ever. You see breasts, panties, and other stuff through out the entire show that are not intended for kids.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main characters, Chizuru, is in love with Kouta. During the course of the show Chizuru does many perverted things to him. While he likes it, he always resists it because he thinks it's wrong. While Chizuru starts doing these things to Kouta, the other students at their school give Kouta the nickname \"The Great Erotic King\". That's just one of the many goofy/erotic things during the show. h.\\n\\n\r\n. While it's super ecchi and fan service, I just thought it was very funny. The comedy of the show is what drew me in (and maybe the ecchi stuff :P). If you love ecchi/fan service stuff, you will probably love this series. While a short ride (12 episodes), it was very enjoyable. I think they may be making another season but, I'm not sure. I know there are 2 OVAs out now but, I don't think any of them are subbed yet.",

I mean why does the boy is shorter than the girl, it would look as if a 16yr old girl would be a couple with a 12yr old boy.\r\nFirst part for me is good, very funny. Middle part would get boring. Last part would get good again.\r\nFinal conclusion: ecchi it is great and many scenes of itis funny. But other than that, nothing is great about it anymore.",

If you like animes with a plot your barking up the wrong tree. It seems to me the producers tried to pick up the pace with the story towards the endbut it was all for naught as it didn't make a positive difference in my opinion. thats all I have to say about the story. \\n\r\n   The art i gave a 7 as most of the time they managed to keep the art together without completely going overbord and the way they depicted most of the scenes i found it quite amuseing. There wasn't much else to say about the art but it was all in all not the worst i've seen.\\n\r\n    For the sound i gave it a 6 i watched the english dub and the characters voices sounded ok but for the japanese i just didn't find Chizuru's voice right. Enough said.\\n\r\n    When it came to charater design and devolopement i gave it a 7 as the character designs looked fairly original to me although in character devolpoement it was just as i had suspected non existant in some cases while for others it was just to shallow and also as i said before this was more somebody way of putting their harem into a cartoon that actually putting a plot to some animations. \\n\r\n    For enjoyment an 8 because the jokes although not original fit into place when they were used. Also they manged to still make me laugh at watching it the second time through (which is rare) so it was given points for that i beleive many people will find that if your are perverted enough to get the umor you will enjoy the anime alot more.\\n\r\n    The overall raiting i gave kanokon was more like an average because all in all i think it was about a 7 not that bad not great but enjoyoble to watch. If you don't really like echi animes you probably shouldn't watch this as it is just that (a perverted anime) of course you probaly wouldn't still be reading this if you didn't like it.",

Hold on while I wipe away my tears from listening back on the ending theme song that reminds me of the heart clenching, warming ending this anime has... All right, I'm good now. I cannot stress how much of a memory this show is for me.\r\nIf you're looking for a wonderful little anime to watch in your free time, pick up Kanokon if you're into harem and ecchi. It will not disappoint.\r\nEver thought back on the days when you were innocent and still learning about the world around you? Well, that's something you'll find yourself falling into; nostalgia andmemories, along with the incredible choice of songs and the sound track this anime had for the time it was released. Even now, it's still above standard.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are.. As you could imagine, perverted or have the tendency of getting into a deprived situation, which is ecchi for you, but this anime stands out among similar titles today, with it's wonderfully crafted combination of FEELS. The personalities of the characters mix well together throughout the show and I suggest picking up where the anime leaves off with the manga series, since the anime doesn't entirely cover the story, but a good portion.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the characters are great. The people behind the animation of the manga did a good job at reflecting the personalities from the manga adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nAs I've praised the music choices, the sound quality is perfect. The art of the show isn't the best, but for it's time, it was definitely near a 10. Story might not be for everyone, even those who enjoy these types of shows, however, based on my own enjoyment, even when I first watched it when I was younger, it deserves a 10/10 - it's stuck with me to this day, for many years. My opinion may be different to a lot, though. However, I am not the only person who holds Kanokon close to their heart, many do that have watched this show when they were younger, anime veterans still remember this title and if you bring it up to one, chances are they'll have only good words for it.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to Kanokon.",

She also gives herself away to Kouta all the time almost like a harlot. Oh yeah, her name is Chizuru. The other girl is named Nozomu and she's much nicer and laid back. She's a glutton when it comes to meat because, she's a wolf-spirit. She too wants Kouta to be with her but, Chizuru alwaysthinks of Kouta as her property and abuses him while in the fierce \"battles\" between Chizuru and Nozomu. This anime is a definite YES to people who love ecchi and supernatural schoolgirls and if they can handle Chizuru's Meanness. Step away if you don't like any of these. Hope this helped.",

            "content": "*This is my first review so please bear with me\r\nLet me highlight the 5 main things I should be judging this based on.\r\nStory - This anime has no stable storyline and is only about a short (lolita-like) boy who has a harem. An older girl, Chizuru, (obviously hot) has an obsession with him and does perverted things around him. She wants him to beg for her most precious part of her body (the one she flaunts around, but say Kouta is only allowed to fondle them and stare at them. Another girl, Nozomu, wants to claim him as her own. She is much smaller andflat-chested. The only thing keeping this story slightly alive is the commentary by Kiriko and Yuki\\n\\n\r\nArt - I thought the art was fine. It wasn't one of which the art looked like it came out of a 90's or early 2000's anime. It didn't have dull color and it did have some parts that wouldn't be considered hentai, but do keep it under the close eye of ecchi. \\n\\n\r\nSound - The voice actors did not do a bad job. Kouta's did sound a bit airy but I did like how innocent he sounded. I realize Nozomu's voice was meant to be a bit robotic (being she's a spirit and reminded me of another anime character), but I did not quite like it how stale it sounded.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The character's all had their unique personality traits...\\n\r\n- Kouta was an embarrassed, and innocent short boy who didn't want to give in to his overall feelings for Chizuru. \\n\r\n- Chizuru, who claimed she only felt for Kouta, would walk around the school feelin only the slight embarrassment in a scandalous outfit. She was very flirtatious.\\n\r\nNozomu - Was a very unknowing girl who acted like Julie Sigtuna from Absolute Duo. She did not know much of what the human race considered something and she seemed overall like that character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I did enjoy this anime. It was happy at the end with Tayura and Akane, Kouta admitting his feelings, and it just felt refreshing after yelling at Kouta through the screen to just choose. I honestly did ship him with Chizuru, although at moments I shipped Chizuru and Nozomu...\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: The thing that kept me going was how hot Saku was... That episode I missed him... He left and I was wondering if we would ever see him again. He was my favorite... I liked this anime... If you were wondering, but maybe it should choose a plot line and give them more character... Not just a flat character. \\n\\n\r\n~ SweetMoko",

            "content": "Ecchi anime isn't known for its strong plots or deep characters, but this one doesn't even try.  The storyline is sub-par, and the writing is awful.  Despite that, it's worth a few laughs, and the occasional \"They can't be going there!\" moments (one word: cake).  Despite the amateur quality of its visuals, sounds, and plot, it still ends up being a fairly enjoyable ecchi anime if you don't mind feeling yourself getting stupider as you watch it.\r\nStory: 3\r\nChizuru the fox-girl tries to get into the hero's pants.  Nozomu the wolf-girl tries to steal him away from her.  Repeat for twelveepisodes.  Throw in the occasional magical battle and obligatory beach and hot springs episodes, and that's the whole plot of the anime.  Yes, it's that dumb.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of parts that make you wonder if you missed something earlier.  For instance, why is Chizuru so infatuated with Kouta in the first place?  And what's with that loli villainess that shows up for a few episodes?  It never fully explains some things that seem like they should be important.\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, Kouta should just be a man and take Chizuru up on her offer.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\\n\r\nThe whole show has a slightly amateur feel to it.  The artwork is sub-par, but not so bad you really notice it.  For some reason, the hero looks like he should still be in elementary school, not high school.  I guess Chizuru and Nozomu have a thing for younger boys.  That's right, the fox and the wolf are cougars!\\n\\n\r\nNotes on fanservice: Some episodes employ strategic censoring, some show everything.  And some show heart-shaped nipples.  (WTF!)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nI like the opening theme.  It's nothing special at first, but after hearing it several times, it kind of grows on you.  Then there's the tango that starts up whenever sexy stuff happens.  For some reason, it makes me laugh every time.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the English dub is pretty lame.  Chizuru has an annoyingly breathy Marilyn Monroe voice, and most of the other characters aren't much better.  There is one exception, however.  I actually like Nozomu's monotone.  I know the emotionless girl is fairly typical for ecchi animes, but somehow hearing it in English makes it hilarious, especially when she calls Chizuru names in that matter-of-fact tone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the characters are pretty dumb.  Chizuru is an oversexed magical fox-girl who is constantly trying to seduce the hero, and that pretty much sums up her personality for the entire show.  There's really nothing more to her.  Nozomu the wolf-girl also has a thing for the hero, though it never explains why except that he tried to do something nice for her when they first met.  And she likes his smell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nBased upon my review above you might think I hate this show, but I actually like it quite a lot.  Kanokon does everything wrong, but somehow still ends up being a lot of fun.  I think part of its charm is that it's not one you get emotionally involved with; you can just kick back and watch an episode or two without any expectations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nIt has a lot of weaknesses, but its sheer entertainment value makes up for them.  Worth watching for the perverted humor, but if you skip this anime, you're not missing much.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*Probably some spoilers in this review\r\nKanokon is the story of a 400 year old fox girl who really badly wants to have sex with a thirteen year old boy. This leads to all sorts of shenanigans as Kouta and Chizuru try to make there forbidden human/fox spirit love a reality.\r\nSome of the deep plots which explore what it really means to be human are as follows; Kouta gets a bracelet stuck on his arm which makes it so he can't get horny anymore, Chizuru's \"sister\" (The snow person) threatens to kills hundreds of high school students in order to test Kouta and Chizuru's love, andChizuru's boobs disappear. All these arcs really make you think and take a good look in the mirror at your life. Even after completed this series I found myself thinking what did it really represent when Chizuru's lost her boobs to a magic potion, and what would I do if I was in the same position as Kouta (With women throwing themselves all over me for no particular reason). \\n\\n\r\nNot only did this series have an interesting narrative, the character development was superb as well. Kouta, for example, goes through some very interesting changes as he begins to learn and grow. At the beginning of the series he is dead against having Chizuru shove her tits in his face 24/7. He sees it as an everyday annoyance that he just has to deal with, but as the series progresses he comes to the realization that perhaps he doesn't mind all that much if he has breasts in his face. We can see this when he asks Chizuru to do it to him. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the character Kouta's arc would usually be enough to warrant a 7 or 8 out of 10 for the series the creators of this anime didn't stop there. Here are some of the other characters whose arcs really touched me on an emotional level:\\n\r\n Nozomu starts out as an emotionless girl who feels as though she doesn't need help from anybody but herself. After meeting Kouta, however, she turns into an emotionless girl who really wants to have sex with Kouta.\\n\r\nChizuru also has some interesting development in this anime. In the beginning she believes that Kouta was hers and hers alone but later on realizes that maybe a threesome with Nozomu wouldn't be that bad after all.\\n\r\nThe last, and my personal favorite, character arc belongs to Nozomu's older brother, Saku. When he first reunites with Chizuru he feels that he must have her. In order to accomplish he tries to put a stake in between the relationship of Kouta and Chizuru. This only changes after Kouta and Chizuru join together and beat him up. Only at that point does Saku begin to realize how wrong he was and how true the love between these two actually is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series really made me think about my life and if I'm actually following the right path. Even writing this review stirs up many emotions that were brought on by this series. I give this series without a doubt 10/10.",

At first I thought Chizuru Minamoto's actions were unwanted by Kouta Oyamada.

Kudos to the producers or who ever chose that... what i mean is when you break the song down at least for me it provides a female dominance tone filled with love, which of course works well with the show.\r\nSomething i can not seem toput to words made me dislike the characters drawn. maybe it was the pointed chin feature.... not sure but i think there was more to it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a show that both genders may like this is worth giving a go.\\n\\n\r\nP.s.

            "content": "For some reason, any time I decide to read a manga, I always for some reason go to the anime adaptation while reading it.  Don't ask, I seriously have no clue why.  Kanokon is one of those things that I have done this strange phenomenon on.\r\nStory (2.99/10):  Kouta, our main protagonist has been thrown into this world of Youkai, where a girl by the name of Chizuru has confessed to him saying that she loves him, while at the same time, revealing that she is a fox youkai.  After some damage to the school, he is thrown into a new lifewhere he must now deal with the threat of Youkai, and the girl that is now at his side.  \\n\\n\r\nFor starters, that synopsis is pretty accurate to both the light novels and manga, but not the anime.  For this anime adaptation, the story is absolute shite.  Not only does this anime not follow the story, it diverts into a different path completely.  What the anime focuses on for basically the entire show, are side stories.  Practically every episode is a different story altogether, leading up to a quite unsatisfying ending that felt very cliched.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat is also a major problem of this anime, is the fact that little to no things are explained.  Unless you have read a good chunk of the manga or light novel, you probably will not understand what exactly is going on in the series, or even who the characters are.  The anime does such a terrible job explaining who side characters in the story are, that it is very likely to forget what their names are.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a cohesive story, this anime is a complete and utter mess.  Almost every episode is a completely different thing, and most of the actual anime is focused on ecchi material rather than an actual story.  However, as an episodic anime, well, it's still not very good even if thought of that way, but it makes it sound a bit better.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n-  Unexplained plot\\n\r\n-  Terrible story cohesion\\n\r\n-  Mostly side stories rather than actual plot\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (4.10/10):  While the story was bad, the characters aren't much better in comparison.  But they have something going for them, I suppose...\\n\\n\r\nKouta Oyamada is our main protagonist in the series.  looking like a grade schooler, this guy gets pretty much no character beyond what you are given in the first episode.  Watch him cringe, watch him run away, watch him struggle to breathe under Chizuru's gigantic DD mounds!  (That happens in every episode BTW.)  I guess what he has really going for him in terms of character development is getting a bit more perverted...but regardless, he's not really that good of a character.\\n\\n\r\nChizuru Minamoto is the main female protagonist in the series.  To put it short, she basically spends the entirety of the series trying to get Kouta's D inside of her.  In every episode, she shows everyone that she has no shame in her body, by shoving Kouta's face into her breasts, and getting pissed whenever nothing happens the way she wants to.  (I.E. everyone cockblocking her)  Apart from that, she rarely shows her youkai self in the anime, to the point that the anime didn't really feel like a show about animal spirits and demons.  But rather, a generic, poorly written slice of life.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, Nozomu Ezomori.  One word, cockblocker.  Without a doubt, this wolf girl's only purpose in this anime is to get in between the non-existent romance that tries to exist.  While emotionless and basically eating as much meat as she can fit in her mouth.  (Dear lord, I disappoint myself.)  There's not really much to her, at all.  \\n\\n\r\nFor side characters, we have a bunch.  Every character from Chizuru's brother Tayura, the class rep Asahina, and the various \"antagonists\" (I use that word lightly) that show up and disappear from existence, are all not very detailed and are more or less single trait garbage.  Many characters in this show have little explanation for their existence in the show, and overall, feel quite pointless to begin with.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  Interesting main characters....\\n\r\n-  Characters that felt randomly put in\\n\r\n-  One note characters\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (6.51/10 and 5.21/10):  While the story and characters aren't incredibly well done, the art is actual somewhat decent.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art, while mostly moe style, actually looks rather nice from its 2008 time period.  The characters look rather well drawn, nothing looked very jarring in terms of animation, and the overall style of it looked rather pleasing.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of art, we have to talk about the fanservice as well.  For a good large chunk of the series, you will see Chizuru topless, to say the least.  The fanservice takes a good large chunk of every episode and depending on what your view of fanservice is, you may or may not want to even begin the show.  Everything from panty shots, seemingly impossible breast physics, to bathing and just baring it all, this series goes above and beyond with its fanservice. (They do show nipple, and very openly at that, so be wary of that.)\\n\\n\r\nFor music, well, it's not terrible.  To explain it a bit more, the anime has some songs that sound good.  The music isn't terrible, but it's not one of those good stuck in your head songs.  Personally, I never bothered to listen to the tracks after the first episode of knowing what they sound like.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  Moe style artwork.  (This of course depends on your view of moe.)\\n\r\n+/-  Quite heavy amounts of fanservice.  (This as well, depends on your view of fanservice.)\\n\r\n+/-  Decent sounding music.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5.96/10): I am personally a fan of mythology based shows.  Particularly, ones about fox spirits or, the ever so well-known nine-tailed fox.  (Naruto doesn't count.)  For Kanokon, well, I have mixed feelings about it.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it?  \\n\r\nWell, yes, to a certain extent.  I've gotten used to fanservice, so the idea of seeing breasts shoved into one guy's face was nothing new to me.  I also love the idea of fox animal girls, so that sort of made me continue watching it.\\n\\n\r\nWas it a good show?  \\n\r\nWell, no.  It was terrible.  The plot and the characters were terribly executed and did not make itself into a good show.  Many plot holes existed in the show, as it focused way too much of fanservice rather than any actual proper plot.\\n\\n\r\nWas it unwatchable?  \\n\r\nWell, not necessarily.  If you're a fan, or don't mind bad plot or fanservice, than this show is fine to watch.  Personally, I wasn't turned away by it, so I was able to watch it the full way through.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend you to watch it?\\n\r\nWell, that depends.  If you don't mind fanservice, go ahead.  But, if you do mind, than I would suggest you look elsewhere.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (5.22/10)",

            "content": "For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.\r\n1.Art - There is not much to say about the art for this series other than it being the definition of average.  It was that classic kawaii style that has become all to popular.  Even though this is true, I still think the character models are supper cute and what's not to love about that.  The art was more or less average; I have no complaints about it.  Art is a 5.\r\n2.Sound- Literally every part of the soundtrack for this show made me want to smash my face in a meat grinder.  IT WAS GOD AWFUL.  Every part of the soundtrack made me feel awful except for one part, the love theme.  The theme that included the piano was beautiful and surprisingly it conveyed emotions to me.  I'm giving the sound a 3.  Honestly I should give it a 2 but that piano love theme was just awesome.\\n\\n\r\n3.Character - Any character development that should have been in this show was replaced with boobs.  I mean that quite literally.  The only thing the characters had going for them was their cuteness and their boob sizes.  But there ain't nothin' wrong with that.  A 5 for boob sizes and kawaii.  Oh yeah and there was also some romance but, whatever.\\n\\n\r\n4.Story - The story of this show is put together pretty poorly.  The main characters are thrown random obstacles to overcome and it made for a wishy-washy story.  I must say though, the romance did make more ground than the actual \"enemy struggle\" that was faced.  The romance at first was just boobs being thrust into the main characters face but by the end of the anime I felt  a little bit of a relationship forming.  The actual struggle against the show's enemies was not good but for a romance it was not that bad, so on that basis I'll give a 6 for the story. \\n\\n\r\n5.Enjoyment - If anyone watches this show and expects a mature story they must be a complete dumb ass.  That being said, I enjoy kicking back and watching a less-serious anime once in a while, and I actually enjoyed how \"less-serious\" this anime was.  If you just wanna chill and not get involved with a super heavy story this show is perfect for you.  I don't think that shows like this should be taken very seriously and I believe if you approach shows like this in a different way you will end up enjoying it.  I enjoyed this show for what it was and for that I give it a 7 in enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is an overall 6.\\n\\n\r\n*I will also recommend that this anime is only watched by a matured audience.\\n\\n\r\nCaution:\\n\r\n!Keep in mind this anime has nudity.",

            "content": "This anime was a starter anime, and to be frank, I was a horny little bastard when I was younger, but now I have learned to control my urges. This anime is perverted and fits well with the Ecchi genres it securely fits itself in. I remember watching this when I was about 13 to 14 years old, locking the door, with my earbuds in so no-one would hear the dialogue of the anime. I decided to re-watch it to find out how well it stands out, and then I realized, it sort of does.\r\nStory: 5\r\nOf course this isn't what stands out, its an Ecchi.The only plot I was able to find basically can be summarized in one sentence. \"The seduction of a young boy by a fox demon and the obstacles they must face to preserve their relationship\". Any other plot came in too late, what with a little demon child showing up and making the Main heroine's large boobs disappear through a unknown solution of which supposedly she could preserve her \"Oni-chan\", or the Main character to be precise from the heroine temptations and seal her powers for easy termination.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nEcchis are basically all art to put it simply, and this is no exception. Everything is drawn beautifully or sensually, with many mixtures of light and dark colors to match the mood of the current feelings or status of characters. Every character could have appeared very sexy, beautiful, handsome, cute, or any of the above\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nAlso where most Ecchis succeed in my opinion. The intro is decent, but I prefer the outro to be honest. Also the characters voices match quite well, with the exception of the English dub, of which blows ass and keeps this category from being a 10. Just stick to subs or plain Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nSurprisingly, there's actually is some pretty decent characters within the show. For example, Kouta is a wimpy, shy, but warm-hearted, smart, and a downright good person who can take responsibility whenever Chizuru doesn't instantly molest him. Another is Chizuru's brother, Tayura, who must tolerate all of his sister's pettiness and constant bickering, just so he can live a happy life in hopes of gaining the confidence to confess to his high school crush, Akane, who has a no nonsense view of things and constantly gives him a hard time. I often found myself rooting for the side characters more than Chizuru herself, since sometimes she acts like a brat that doesn't get her way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nBesides the constant attempted rapes and molestations by Chizuru to Kouta, I found myself chuckling quite often in the simple absurdity most of our characters must deal with on a daily basis. The beginning is no better than the rest of the anime (of which isn't bad) but leaves a lot to be desired by the end due to a new character being introduced formally near the end.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of a few Ecchi animes I will recommend since it isn't terrible or boring and does try to keep the watchers attention (in a good way)",

But that's all i'm gonna say, don't think my comment was that helpful but I felt I had to put in a comment after what I read.\r\nAnyway if you can't handle a touch or a splash into the ecchi genrethat you should not watch this.",

I watched the first episode of it (I do have a problem with watching a show with one set of a voices then having to switch overcause it messes with me but this was not the case) and I must say the voice actors are extremely bad... I merely watched the first episode of it so I didn't hear EVERYONE'S voice but Kouta sounded way too girly (Yea he's supposed to be some weak kid but that doesn't mean he's gotta sound like this), Chizuru was WAYYY too soft (From my understanding Chizuru does anything she could to be with Kouta and had no problems being intimate with him, why does she sound like she's a defenseless character...), I think the only one who sounded decent for their character was Tayura.",

I am guessing it will never be extended to a second season, but it was a fun ride to the end. I most enjoyed seeing the character development of our heroine Chizuru as we findout about her crazy family, and as she beats back various magical relative's interests in her boyfriend. Our other Heroine Nozomu had the best dry understated deadpan humor lines I've seen in an anime so far. A super enjoyable series. Highly recommend.",

Most of the characters except the main female characters were annoying, and the ending was so predictable I thought I was psychic. The only reason I gave it a 7 was because the ecchi elements of theseries (which are quite more ecchi than even your average legitimate manga) amused me.
