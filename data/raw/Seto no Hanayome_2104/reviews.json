            "content": "Seto no Hanayome is one of the rarest types of anime you can find - a parody rom-com that is actually extremely funny!\r\nThis is without doubt one of the funniest animes released in the past few years, and I have never seen parody done so well since the original Jungle wa itsumo hale nochi guu (especially Michishio Nagasumi's pardoy of Ken from Fist of the North Star, and Runa's father as the the terminator).\r\nThe art style in this anime, like most parodies, can take a little getting used to, but it doen't really cause headaches. The characters have all have their own quirks and foibles(San-chan's sakura petals appearing out of nowhere for instance, and Nagasumi's first kiss - I laughed so hard I got cramps), but these traits enhance the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest plus points for this anime is the ending. All too often in anime we see a great series end with a whimper. Not here. The ending was brilliant in both it's seriousness and it's humour - in other words it's seriously funny. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this series to anyone who likes jaw dropping, side splitting, mind boggling humour. I have laughed as much since I first watched Inukami - now there's ashow that's SO wrong :D",

            "content": "First off, I would like to get this straight. I am not a huge fan of romance anime's, throw in a harem in the way, then just forget about it . Now, dont get me wrong. I am not saying this anime breaks away from the tired formula of harems, in fact it has the word cliche written all over it. But what separates this anime from the rest, is  how it uses those cliche to its advantage.\r\nRead the synopsis, an average student gets forcibly married to the girl. We all know how those goes, right? Yes, the plot has been done a hundredtimes before and its teeming with stereotypical characters. Even each individual episode is predictable, as the anime goes through any harem anime would. Throughout the anime more girls come to like the protagonist, more fan service. its all textbook execution.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake here. Yes, the episode start out predictable at first, but you have no idea what Seto is capable of. It will go from cliche and then takes a huge step forward and jump to embellished. It has a fast paced and frankly, I liked it.\\n\r\nIts a nice change of pace. You get to laugh non-stop in a whole episode.\\n\\n\r\nI have no qualms for the sound and animation, as it does not pursue to be anything different. The animation is what you expect it to be in an anime(gravity defying hairs, radiant character designs) and the sound does nothing to stand out for me to mention anything. But from the start of the OP, it tells you that the anime will make you laugh.\\n\\n\r\nBut one of the key factors of why Seto No Hanayome is so downright hilarious is its brilliant application of the K.I.S.S theory. Seto No Hanayome is by no means a laid-back anime, but at the same time, there is no dull moment here as every moment is hectic enough for you to go &quot;lmfao!&quot;. It tries to be what it can and should be, simple and funny. Because of this, the formula works.The anime is all about comedy, nothing else. It wont throw you any cheap drama just for the hell of having it. Although because its lackluster for romance, it becomes a turn off people who hunger for something amatory. But that doesnt mean the relationship between Nagasumi and San doesnt develop, its just a little late thanks to the rest of the female cast that constantly grasps Nagasumi's attention.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong points of Seto is its parodies. Its derision ranges from Japanese Culture to American, heck, it even makes fun of itself. Who wouldve thought that they actually include a Hokuto No Ken parody here? Not to mention Terminator. Every episode will have you tapping the floor at least once because of its unrelenting low-brow humor. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters also gives way for comedy, as each of one of them is provides comic antics albeit that all of it are horrifically trite. Whether its the over-protective father, the yandere, or the timid class president, they will all crack you up. Plus, the influence and interaction on each other have has a significance.And to my surprise, there is even character development. The typical lame protagonist not only goes through a transition, but something you can never imagine. He is able to mature, and he erase whatever bad impression you have for harem male leads.\\n\\n\r\nSeto No Hanayome adds nothing new to the genre. It is another recycling of harem anime's. But its sheer presence of comedy is outstanding that you'll pay no attention to its unoriginal qualities. For the first time in a long time, a harem is done right.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Seto No Hanayome is the romantic comedy that you have been looking for. Its rollicking, its over-the top and its just plain straightforward. To say its funny, would be an understatement. This is cliche at its best.",

            "content": "Seto no Hanayome is a Romantic, Comedy about a young boy who was saved from drowning by a beautiful mermaid and according to mermaid law, he/she must die. However to escape their wrath, he decides to marry her but this will eventually cause more problems. The premise of the show may be that of an average Romantic Comedy but it is so enjoyably fun to watch that it doesn&rsquo;t matter.\r\nThat is basically how the story begins and from that point on there really isn&rsquo;t any storyline that moves the series along, but just a bunch of random cliched settings that every anime fan is familiarwith. That&rsquo;s not all, as this anime happens to move so fast that you can easily forget what joke was made a couple minutes ago but that is the style that works well with the show. Even though this is a romantic comedy, it is the comedy that is prominent throughout and it is the various parodies, which allows this unlikely show to rival the more popular series such as: Excel Saga and Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in this anime are great in their own individual way however out of all of them it is the male protagonist that truly stands out. Not only that he brings out the comedy from the characters around him but he also manages to act in a believable manner and he always ends up saying what we might be thinking, at the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is really hard to describe, where at times it can look piss poor there are also times it looks great, but this is really just to suit the whacky nature of the show. The action parody moments are the times when the animation truly shines and it's those moments which are to look forward to. On the other hand the music is decent, nothing amazing or special about it but good enough to gain merit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Seto no Hanayome is one of those anime series, appearing every now and again, that may seem average but manages to surpass your expectations. This proved to be one of the most enjoyable comedy anime series of the year 2007, with plenty of laughs to be had. Yet it was lacking in the story department, to allow it to reach the same level of other popular Parody Rom/Coms (Fumoffu?). Nonetheless, as a comedy, this is one you must see.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "DO NOT watch this anime in public (especially when you are surrounded by people, ie. library @ school, internet cafe, or wherever) unless you want to embarrass yourself due to uncontrollable laughing-out-loud (a real LOL). Consider yourself warned!\r\nTo start it off, I consider Seto no Hanayome a masterpiece of its genre(s). It is unfortunate that Seto no Hanayome was aired at the same time as Lucky Star, as some of its glory was \"drowned\" by it.\r\nStory:\r\nThere isn't much of a storyline to really talk about for Seto no Hanayome except for how everything got started (which you can read from the synopsis above). After that,each episode basically consists of random events follow by some more ridiculously stupid events and help bring us to the end. However, these little the bits and pieces of randomness does build up quite well overtime and give us a broad picture of not only the main casts, but the general surrounding environment as well. However, each mini story are all very well thought out and made my guts cry in pain (due to uncontrollable laughter).\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt is quite obvious that the animation crew have put in a lot of effort to make the viewers enjoy the show in different perspectives. They are very clever in the sense that know WHEN to over-emphasize on character expressions to make the show hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is pretty catchy, but overall there isn't anything that I can recall to be particularly outstanding. Although the occasional theme music matches very well with whatever that is going on in that episode. I also love the music that accompanies  San's chivalrous moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAll characters (the main and supporting casts) are all unique in their own way and they all help contribute to the parody of the show. Due to the lack of story, Seto no Hanayome actually end up with plenty of room for character developments and they did a very good job at that. One can feel the \"liveliness\" of each character as they mature throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Overall:\\n\r\nCome to think of it, I have never rated an anime (especially one with virtually NO main story plot) a 9/10 overall. I am still pretty surprised at myself, but as I compare Seto no Hanayome to previous anime of the same genre that I have watched, it is hard to put them on the same level. Definitely a must watch for everyone who wants a laugh of their lifetime.",

            "content": "I can summarize this entire anime in one short phrase: AHHHHHHH! \r\nI kid you not, the show cannot go hardly a minute without an interjection or over-the-top exclamation. I seriously had a hard time getting into this mainly for that reason. Even though it was a rom/com/harem anime, a genre which I generally enjoy, this, however, I really had to fight to stay interested. \r\nThe overall story's main arc is developed by our hero meeting a mermaid during his summer vacation. Well, as you could expect, things don't work out too peacefully, and the story takes it from there - death, or marrying a (rathercute/nicely drawn) mermaid (the one that saved him). The story is summarized nicely in its panel here and any guesses you might have about how the story ends up will probably be correct, as this anime is, for lack of a better term, \"predictable\". \\n\r\nIt's pretty original; and probably the most redeeming part of this anime. I mean, what would you do if you were to be married-off at 14-15? \\n\r\nYou'll encounter other \"sub-arcs\" throughout the entire series, mostly encompassing two-to-three episodes, but overall, the main focus here is on the relationship between our hero and San (can't remember the boy's name at the moment); as these sub-arcs serve to only further advance the progress of the main arc. This is what really saves this anime from being a shouting train wreck. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the art a lot. Some of the funniest moments were when San or Luna were staring blankly at a situation or an event in front of them and they had their entire eyes glaze over and liken to the shade of their hair. There are really a lot of different art styles at play here and most are basically eye-candy. The characters movements aren't robotic and rusty, but are drawn rather eloquently. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound also added a comedic mixture to the characters. It's hard to describe exactly what I'm referring to, but you'll have to watch the series to find out. \\n\r\nBut, like I stated previously, the sound (a.k.a. \"the screaming\")was also a huge gripe. It singlehandedly ruined the enjoyment of this anime for me, probably because I found my ears bleeding halfway in to each episode. Turn down your speakers, volume, what have you, just turn it down, please. 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, the characters weren't all that great because they relied too much on the comedy that each of their personalities brought to the table. Which, at first was fresh and funny, and you thought to yourself, \"This is a good start, can't wait to see what new things they can come up with in the next episode for 'x' character.\" Problem is: they don't. Each character's comedy is like washing multiple loads of laundry: wash, rinse, and repeat. \\n\r\nThe only characters I found tolerable were, thankfully, San (because she has a lot of screen time) and Luna's father. \\n\r\nSan's comedy, unlike the rest was just oozing ignorance and awkwardness that you just couldn't not like it! Her character is somebody you root for because this is a harem; there is some competition for our hero. \\n\r\nLuna's father was just as funny because of the obvious reference to him as Arnold Schwarzenegger in the \"Terminator\" trilogy. It was hilarious to hear him say his lines and his actions towards the other characters were definitely Arnold-esque, and, I thought, very funny. I would easily vote him as the best character in the series. \\n\r\nOthers aren't so fortunate. Maki just ends up being extremely annoying and one-dimensional, which really is a shame because she had an opportunity to be a really intriguing character; Gozoburo (San's father) just screams all of his lines nonstop, and I can clearly picture the voice actor saying those lines surrounded by hundreds of bottles of water in the recording studio just gasping for breath and scratching his throat. Luna, ended up being just an odd character, the way that they drew her as \"crazy Luna\" was too much for me to be funny and it had the lasting effect of being generally creepy. PLUS SOME MORE SUB-PAR CHARACTERS! 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment was not a satisfactory one. If you take a look at how many episodes I watched, you'll see that I didn't watch all 26. The three that I didn't watch were episodes I turned off because I was just so fed-up with the so called \"humor\" that was recycled so many times it resembled garbage, the ridiculous amount of screaming, or just me thinking, \"Why was this even an episode? They could have used the money spent on this towards feeding the homeless.\"\\n\r\nThere were seldom, and very few bright spots, throughout the series. The love story was cute, but not as engaging as other animes out there, the comedy was VERY hit-and-miss, the story was okay, and most of the characters just wanted to make me pull my hair out. 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted so badly to get into this anime. After reading some reviews, I was so psyched to watch it! Well, either my expectations were too high or something else happened, because I could just not get into it. The potential was there, which makes it so frustrating: a fairly original story, a harem that's actually above average, a love story that's engrossing and cute, but all for not. \\n\r\nOverall, this anime tries too hard to be funny by forcing it down, into your ears with all the screaming dialog, the love story is under-represented, the vast majority of the characters are annoying, and nothing really happens, other than a few characters get introduced throughout the length of the series. But, you know when an anime's a definite miss when a reviewer thinks you could end it at episode 14 and not waste making 12 more episodes. 5/10.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes it is just nice to have a ordinary love story. A young man and a mermaid find one another and get engaged under pain of death. The father in-law sics a shark on the young man and calls him up in the middle of the night and whispers in a deep voice \u201cI am going to rip your frickin balls off\u201d. You know the usual father in-law type of things. O and I forgot the father in-law is part of the underwater Yakuza. Yea just another ordinary love story. \r\nThe show opens with a mermaid saving a young boys' life. The boys name isNagasumi and the mermaids name is San. Apparently there is a rule that if a human sees the true form of a mermaid that mermaid must die. Sans father isn't exactly crazy about that idea, so he comes up with a plan. He is going to kill Nagasumi. San and her mother are not in love with that plan so they come up with a new one. If Nagasumi marries San he will be part of the mermaid clan and the problem will be solved. Sans father doesn't want to loose his precious little girl to marriage so he comes up with a plan. He is going to kill Nagasumi. No one ever blames Sans father for being overly creative. From here the craziness ensues, plus you know all the attempted killings.\\n\\n\r\nMore than anything \u201cSeto no Hanayome\u201d is about nonstop comedy. I did find a lot of the show funny but the show is really NONSTOP comedy. The show just never lets up. Plenty of genuine moments of romance or storytelling are ruined by the shows need to tell a joke every second and a half. This is also the main reason why so many jokes are just pounded into the ground. The first time Nagasumi is almost killed, funny; 5 billionth time, not so much. The show does get better at knowing when to let up as time goes on but even at the end it is pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a shame that the show is so crazy most of the time because underneath all of it is actually a good romance. Most of the usual high school romance plot devices are used. Several girls have crushes on Nagasumi, love triangles, etc. The thing is these things are all down played so much it is almost as through they aren't there. Example, Kai is introduced a few episodes into the show. He has had a crush on San sense he was young and vows to steal San away from Nagasumi. He makes a big attempt on the first episode he is introduced but that is about it. He is still there for the rest of the show and he continues to hate Nagasumi but he really doesn't do anything to try to steal San away. I think he makes one attempt right before the end of the show but that is all. There are obvious complains to be made for introducing plot elements and then never really doing anything with them, but I really enjoy this approach. None of the clutter that usually comes with a romances are here. There isn't a group of girls pushing themselves on one guy episode after episode, you don't have two people who obviously like one another but take 15 episodes for one of them to say something, and even though they are both very dedicated to carrying out the promise of marriage neither are under some dilution of love at first site. So at the end of the day what you have is just a guy and a girl getting to know one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is, if nothing else, interesting. Everyone is pretty much insane in their own fashion. Nagasumi and San are easily the two most normal, but considering their competition that isn't necessarily saying a whole lot. San seems normal enough most of the time but other times she seems oblivious to situations including Nagasumis near death experiences. Nagasumi is freaking out for half of every episode, admittedly he is trying to be assassinated a lot of the time so it is somewhat justified. Individually these two are OK but together as a couple they really seem to shine. The rest of the cast plays their comical rolls. This isn't to say I didn't enjoy them or that they don't have personalities, because they definitely all have their own personalities. It is just that they don't really get any development and the part they play in the story is to setup jokes. The characters do go along with the none stop comical style of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe main fault of this show is that it tries too hard. Which is too bad because I did enjoy a lot of the comedy and there is a nice romance hidden in here. With the show just not knowing when to let up the comedy gets tiresome after a little while and too many moments that didn't need comedy are ruined. If you are someone who doesn't mind comedy that never lets up even in scenes were it probably should than I highly recommend it. You will have the comedy you love plus a decent romance. For anyone else my guess is you will start getting a little frustrated with the show before you get to the halfway point.",

I'm not a fan of the harem anime's from the start, and I didn't originally think this would be like that. \r\nHonestly it's best redeeming quality is the opening theme...\r\nIt's supposed to be funny, but I find it hard to watch due to the fact that basically every episode consists of yelling and screaming. And really, the whole trying-to-kill-Nagasumi thing gets old REALLY fast. A lot of things happen, but I haven't laughed at all, because it's more annoying than funny. \r\nThe story is hidden in the background ofthe attempted humour, and isn't all that great, either. \\n\r\nThe character are alright, but none of them stand out as unique. Nagasumi is no different from guys in other harem animes, and none of the characters are fresh. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound of the anime are the only things I enjoyed. I really wanted to get into it, but EVERY episode is the same. I'm not even finished the series yet, but I'm not sure I'll even be able to. \\n\r\nThey could have made this story really funny, and there is potential for it, but they fail.",

            "content": "My Bride is a Mermaid, wow, just wow.\r\nIn my life, I've only experienced exuberant mirth once.\r\nI found myself fallen from my chair, gripping the underside of my couch, asphyxiating from laughter, tears streaming down my cheeks as my sides burned in protest. I can truly, without a doubt, say that this show is a one of a kind comedic experience, and was it ever fun. \r\nSavvy, that's what My Bride is a Mermaid is.\r\nArtwork and Animation: 10\r\nMy Bride is a Mermaid covers an immense amount of animation styles. Given that it's part parody, many of these styles are directly inspired by other popular and wellknown series. There are several Jojo inspired bits, Fist of the North Star, Death Note, Naruto, the list goes on and on and on. Pop culture makes an enormous splash here too, with things like the Terminator. \\n\r\nOn top of all this, Mermaid manages to have its own style as well, which is rather cutesy and exaggerated, but lends itself well to the comedy. It's very fluid, very fast moving, with lots of GIANT EXPLODING BOLD TEXT, and small details that are easy to overlook that all add up into one massive reference filled laugh fest. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the definitive English dub experience, truly. An ensemble cast of industry veterans and new voices alike, Mermaid is absolutely riotous with these zany, extremely energetic performances. Todd Haberkorn (FMAB), Alexis Tipton, and Cherami Leigh head up a star studded cast of voice talent, and to great effect. The ubiquitous Monica Rial stands out as Maki, the pint sized, voracious mob assassin; Christopher Sabat as Masa, the smooth talking ladykiller right hand man; and finally John Swasey as Gozaburo Seto: constantly livid, definition-of-rage mob man to name a few other standouts. The voices are incredibly dynamic, engaging, and utterly hilarious, all the time. Never a dull moment with this group.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are great tunes, the ska-surf feel of the intro fits in perfectly with the ocean/sea theme, and the endings are cute. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nNagasumi Michishio is the quintessential \"short-legged, good for nothing, unimpressive\" middle school loser. He's got nothing going for him- he's a total klutz, goofy as they come, and has a penchant for getting himself into dangerous situations, which play off more and more hilariously as the series progresses. What he does have going for him, though, is heart. After he's saved from drowning by Sun Seto, his life takes a turn for the crazy, and all manner of undersea mishaps, misunderstandings, and sheer ludicrousity ensue. \\n\\n\r\nSun is a young mermaid, daughter of super dangerous mob boss Gozaburo Seto. Well meaning, but air-headed, Sun often generates as much trouble for Nagasumi as he does for himself, but she stays true, and is a very heartfelt character. She is often used as a foil for Nagasumi, Lunar, or Gozaburo, but she has plenty of moments to shine on her own, too.\\n\\n\r\nLunar: diva, pop star, and ferociously possessive to a violent level. She is the definition of cute psycho. One second she's an axe murdering bitch, the next she's an adorably narcissistic moe character. As Japan's biggest pop singer, another lover of Nagasumi's, and new student at school, Lunar adds yet another dimension of insanity to his previously mundane life. \\n\\n\r\nAbout half the supporting cast get nearly as much screen time as the main trio, but this section would be as long as the entire review if I went through all of them individually. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe basis for My Bride is a Mermaid is a subversion of the Shotgun Wedding. One misunderstanding piled on top of another typically form the crux of the conflict in this show, and while many RomComs follow an episodic style, Mermaid went with a full 26 episode story arc. While it goes off on some tangents, it's never unpleasant, because it's just so dang funny. \\n\r\nOne thing leads to another, and after Nagasumi is rescued by Sun, he's presented with an ultimatum: die, or... die. Under mermaid law, if any human sees them in their fish form, they're to be killed. Either that, or the mermaid who allowed their-self to be seen must be put to death... but when your dad is the most feared mob boss under the seas, that's not likely. There is a third option, however. The third option is that they get married. \\n\r\nSoon, Nagasumi's previously boring middle school existence is uprooted when his life is invaded by an entire mob family from under the sea, to uproarious results. They take over his school, his house, all aspects of his life- trying desperately (but failing) to kill him before this wedding happens. Thankfully for Nagasumi, the one thing he's good at is miraculously being able to avoid being eaten, chopped up, blown up, shot, stabbed, or otherwise destroyed. Let the games begin. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm no stranger to comedies, holding Seinfeld in the highest regard, but I have never seen a show before that has so consistently made me laugh so hard that I cried. There was not one episode that I didn't at least chuckle at. Full blown side clutching, tears streaming down were a common occurrence. I can't award enough points in enjoyment. The humor really clicked with me, and I've seen just enough film and anime to get a majority of the parodical elements, which really made the experience that much richer. \\n\\n\r\nThe Branchial Respiration Brothers Jojo remix.\\n\r\nLunar's Papa, The Terminator.\\n\r\nThe pop culture parody and clever satire, nobody is safe!\\n\r\nThe PUNS.\\n\\n\r\nMy Bride is a Mermaid has everything comedy. Despite being in a genre known only for its schlock, Mermaid breaks free of the Rom-Com mold by being FUNNY! A breath of fresh air from the other so called comedies, this one knows when to play it straight, when to lay everything out on the table, when to jump Shark Fujishiro, and how to take the laughter to stratospheric levels. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs an homage to the 80s Yakuza film craze, Mermaid starts out with a lot of comedic value. Taken further by the undersea theme- there's a TON of fodder with all the sea creature jokes and funnies. Mafias made up entirely of mermaids and fish? It's wacky, it's crazy, and it's SO much fun. Every moment is a favorite, it's endlessly quotable, and there's something that everyone will recognize and laugh at here. \\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely. As far as animated comedies go, this is my #1, forever. Overall, this one might beat out Seinfeld on a good day. It's really that funny.",

            "content": "I haven't done a review in a while, but every now and then a show pops up that just asks for it. Seto no Hanayome is one of those shows.\r\nSo you are looking for a show that can make you laugh? Look no further. Seto no Hanayome is just the thing for you! In all 26 episodes there hasn't been a single moment that made me consider putting it down. Its just too dang hilarious! No matter what situations the main characters end up in. One thing is guaranteed. And that is a good laugh. \r\nBut SnH manages to go beyond being a funny show.The story isn't really anything special. Its just your average sudden bride thing. But its the way they handle it. The easy way out would be putting the 2 in some awkward positions, drop in a rival or 2, and fill the rest up with fan service. And to be honest. to a point SnH does just that. But there is more to it. The main cast is just very lovable. Whether its the cute but naive San, The cute but deep down scary Luna, or the poor but lovable Nagasumi. You can't help but like them. But the side cast has its unique appeal as well. My personal favorites being Mawari and Shark, Fujishiro. The characters are used to their full potential, and its just hard to hate any one of them. And I almost forgot to mention the excellent voice acting! The story isn't that impressive, but it carries the show well, and the climax of the series is actually pretty dang impressive. For once we have a romantic comedy that actually gives you a feeling of closure. Even though there is still loads of potential for a second season *crosses fingers*\\n\\n\r\nAnother fun factor comes from the many references to other shows. Not just anime either. From Hokuto no Ken and JoJo's Bizarre adventure to the Terminator. Its hilarious to spot these references and certainly gives you a reason to watch the show more then once.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI could ramble on about it, but i suggest just checking it out. Its funny, its cute, and manly at the same time. Just give it a go, you'll thank me later.",

            "content": "I myself am not the biggest fan of the comedy genre, most of the comedy entries these days are bland and generic with no substance that will only get a slight giggle at best. But, Seto no Hanayome is different, it's a unique entry that actually made me laugh out loud on every single episode, which is amazing considering I don't like comedy.\r\n(There will be a tl;dr summary at the bottom for those who don't like to read)\r\n[LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD]\r\nThe story starts out with our protagonist Michishio Nagasumi, regarded by most as a useless person that shines in the most useless of ways in uselesssituations. He is on vacation on Seto island visiting his grandmother's. One day while he was at the beach, he went too far out and almost drowned, almost. He sees the image of what looks like a mermaid come to his aid, this mermaid was Seto Sun, the daughter of the Seto mermaid yakuza leader. Since Nagasumi saw Sun in her mermaid form, Sun has two options, she kills him and anyone else who saw her, or she marries him. \\n\\n\r\nThis sets up the series with a premise that allows for a lot of comedy to ensue, \"But wait\" you might ask, \"Hasn't this premise been done before in things like To Love Ru?\" You would be correct, but what separates Seto no Hanayome from the rest is the way that it executes its jokes.\\n\\n\r\nMost of them fall under the \"Ironic Comedy\" category, basically setting up a situation where you think you know what's going to happen next, like a girl trying to confess her feelings to a guy, then throwing a wrench in the works and giving you something completely different then what you expected. Another plot device that produces massive amounts of comedy is the fact that if any mermaid gets water on their legs, their legs turn back into mermaid form\\n\\n\r\nAlso, since this is a parody anime, there are many references and jokes correlating to their respective franchises, such as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Naruto, Dragonball Z, and even Evangelion and Sgt Frog.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the subject of comedy is completely subjective and what people find funny varies from person to person, it's hard to watch this show and not get a hard laugh out of it.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I had a gripe with at first was the art style, I could forgive the animation seeing as it was made 7 years ago, but the art style didn't click with me at first, especially the design of the main heroine, Sun. She has these bang-things that are on the top of her head that go all the way down to her chin, I'm not sure if this is how she was meant to be or if it's just making fun of similar hairstyles in other anime, because it does resemble a lot of hairstyles from Naruto. Another major gripe I had in general, which were the eyes of the characters, the eyes in particular don't sit well with me, they look like someone glued legos to their eyes. But I completely understand why they are the way they are, it's a parody anime, and the art styles of which tend to be on the goofy side of the spectrum, who knows, it might be a light jab at other parody anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that makes this series great is its cast of characters, as generic as they may be. I'll start with Seto Sun, the main heroine of the series and love interest of Nagasumi, she comes off as somewhat of an airhead at times but shows a strong passion towards Nagasumi, with the sword skills of a master and a code of honor comparable to that of a medieval knight. Yes, as much as this show likes to flaunt it's comedy around, it really does have solid characters and character development. \\n\\n\r\nI might sound like a broken record at this point, but there's another pro of this anime, that being its soundtrack. It has many tracks that are only played on only one or two episodes, which gives the soundtrack lots of variety, one of my personal favorites being \u7028\u6236\u4e4b\u82b1\u5ac1-Your Gravitation, which is the song that Seto Sun sings at about the halfway point of the series. It has these tracks that really do enhance the comedy as well as make the scenes of romance that more impactful. Hell, even some of the tracks are a parody, the track Hageshii Uta has a striking resemblance to Through the Fire and Flames by Dragonforce oddly enough.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr: Seto no Hanayome is a unique entry in the rom-com genre that really hits home with the execution of its comedy and overall enjoyment with great music and lots of rewatch potential.",

            "content": "Let me go out on a limb here and say this. This anime is with no contest the funniest anime I have ever seen. I'm not really a \"lol\" person but this anime genuinely made me laugh..... a lot.\r\nUnfortunately, the story itself is a little cliched. Man forced into marriage due to punishment of death and in laws don't like it blah blah blah irrelevant. Seto is different due to the fact that it doesn't need an engaging story to be an engaging anime. The rest of it's features more than make up for the story and therefore make it irrelevant.\r\nThere was something that mademe fall in love with the art style. At times, it seemed normal, then it became ridiculous and over the top (especially when the main character Nagasumi is being viciously attacked, which happens all the time). The fact that in the funnier scenes, the characters looked ridiculous added to the stupid humour of the whole scene. An amplification, if you will. \\n\\n\r\nSound does it's job, with a catchy musical score. I like the background Western style music that's played when something \"manly\" happens and the harmonica thing that plays with something more depressing or the appearance of one of my favourite characters, Masa-san. Voice acting is amazing, with many characters (especially Lunar and Maki, changing their voices, from something normal, to something strange, which is funny)\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters are what really shine. You have the main guy Nagasumi, who I really feel sorry for. Damn near every main girl character in the cast is in love with him, which makes for some great scenarios, which don't exactly end well for Nagasumi, especially when he is suspected of cheating (then again, I would love to be in his position!). Then you have San, who is a girl who is quite dense but with a chivalrous spirit which really shines. Her love for Nagasumi is very admirable and I'm glad the two of them are the main pairing. Then we have Lunar, who is an interesting character, as her personality completely changes depending on the situation to suit her. She is an idol with a tough life, being beaten by San in every way, including Nagasumi, who she loves, but doesn't show it.\\n\r\nSan's family is great, most of them hate Nagasumi (apart from two I believe) which makes for some great moments when Nagasumi is nearly killed or ordered to be killed. San's mother stands out as the protector/mentor for Nagasumi, it's especially satisfying to see her effortlessly stop her husband's murderous efforts. I love the character of Masa, who makes Nagasumi's face change to one of total love due to an unfortunate incident with CPR (Nagasumi's first kiss), which is an awesome running gag.\\n\r\nThe classroom characters are also good and well fleshed out. You have Mawari, who is a little unbelievable in how righteous she is, but can be funny, she treats any boy's advances as being perverted, even accidental ones. Then you have Kai and Saru, who go well together, in a sort of master servant bro-mance way (Saru's perverted nature makes for great laughs). You have the Class President, a hidden gem as she goes unnoticed the majority of the time, but then turns out to be great looking without the thick glasses. Her lonely nature and her bad luck make her one of my favourite characters. Overall, I love all the characters as they add to the hilarious experience.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment was fantastic with every episode having many reasons to watch it again. My favourite episode was 21, and without revealing much, it involves love letters, magic potion, extreme love, extreme hate, and some bad luck. WATCH THAT EPISODE IF NO OTHER!\\n\\n\r\nI love this anime, I hope for more, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves romance, and laughs.\\n\\n",

Plus he is whining in EVERY episode.\r\nThat is not very masculine...however he gets all the nice girls (Harem).\r\nI won't talk about the others, becauseI wouldn't write a good word.\\n\\n\r\nIf your older than 12 yr you shouldn't waste your time.\\n\r\nThere are plenty of good animes (except this one of course).\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS ANIME IS AMAZING!!!!!!!\r\nSeriously I just finished watching it for the 3rd time and I've come to the conclusion that this anime is perhaps the most underrated anime of all time. Not only does the current 7.88 score on mal confuse the heck out of me, it also makes me disappointed that some people may see that score and be turned away by it, although it's not \"low\", it doesn't do this anime justice. This anime is among the best, among the big boys and definitely a classic that has stood the test of time, I watched this is 2018, it came out in 2007,and I somehow felt like I'm seeing something new and refreshing, absolute fantastic masterpiece that would guarantee you a great time, I'll tell you why.\\n\\n\r\nIt proves that you really can't judge a book by its cover, or review on MAL.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple and easy to comprehend, although pretty crazy, I won't explain the whole thing but you should go into this anime with no expectations and no pre-thought about it. The story build up is amazing as well, for such a weird plot, it's surprisingly comprehensible and intriguing as anime takes its time to set up the story and characters so you care and actually like them.\\n\\n\r\nThe humour in this series is absolutely amazing, every episode is funny asf and jokes never get old. This anime also has some of the funniest and wackiest expressions you'll ever see, which is definitely a bonus. Especially once shit really goes down around episode 5-20\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is there I guess but that's not the full point of this anime, some people consider this a \"harem\" but it's not like that yuck shit at all. It's a full on comedy series that could use a little romance here and there but the romance is just a key factor towards the comedy as well. Don't be expecting some squeaky harem shit, these are all respectable characters that have their dignities straight .\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are so lovable and there's not one that lacks behind another, they're all intricately designed and crafted so that they differentiate between each other and have their own charms and wacky senses, fucking amazing. P.s characters in this are not all introduced straight away \\n\\n\r\n*The animation in this series, although nothing special at first, immediately starts to hit you, it's absolutely masterful, each frame is crafted to perfection and the directing is amazing as well, with camera angles being spot on and clear to the scene.\\n\r\n*The art style is also so unbelievably great as well, everytime when the basic animation and set design is about to get old they throw some good shit at you, like a jojo parody or even a comic book style car chase, it's really rare to see an anime this creative and smart these days, which is a shame as this shit is reeaaaally fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe best I can compare this to is buellers day off, where it's a crazy comedy with crazy shit happening, but it's not TOO stupid and outrageous that people could think its for kids. This is for a mature audience that knows how to laugh and have a good time \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, perhaps the funniest and most entertaining rom com anime you'll ever watch, don't let the strange introduction throw you off. You know that feeling when you first start a new fresh anime series and you like all pumped up and shit? yeah this anime is like that for every episode you watch throughout the 26 episodes as well as a few ovas. Every episode is expertly crafted and made to maximize your entertainment. Go have a watch right now, trust me you will not regret it.",

            "content": "I'm bad with reviews, and the top reviews are most likely what people will only see, but I'll still write one.  Seto No Hanayome is hands down, the best romcom that I have seen, that uses the usual cliche comedy mechanics, and uses them in a way that is enjoyable AND funny, without being dry or dull.  The story never had a dull moment and had a lot of humorous moments.  There were even references to real-life movies which were fun to figure out and were funny if you understood what they meant or at least, what they were attempting to replicate.\r\nThedescription of Seto No Hanayome is perfect in describing this show, Ill just leave it at that.   The story, was easy to follow.  Its pretty straight forward and only has a few flashback moments.   The art was a bit old, but I enjoy that style.   They had various forms of it as well, so they can be super detailed and serious, or it could be like how Lucky Star is and thus be not so super detailed.   The sounds, were perfect!   They used the best choice of sound effects and music clips, for the various situations which made the scenes so much funnier.  Characters were all loveable and unique enough to differentiate.   Enjoyment, 10/10   \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime a lot and am extremely grateful to have watched it.   However, I'm only giving it a 10.    The sad part, is that MAL, does not let us give ratings above 10, so I'm forced to give it a 10.  Oh well.",

            "content": "So I was on funimation viewing comedy anime's and I found this. I wanted to watch this because I was confused cause I did not think mermaids existed in Japan but I guess they do. To be honest I did not find the mermaids \"hot\". Maybe this is because they were in like middle school with pissed me off. Look that was everything I thought in beginning but until I got passed episode 1 It was actually lit. The abusive dad to Nagasami is hella gold and I did not think to show would get better than that. Until they went to school like Idid not even know mermaids went to school. I was #lmao the whole time. It must suk tho to have your parents work at your school like I know she a girl but that hella lame I would not hit that tbh. Id rather tap that ah, on Lunar. You see even though during this series their was a bloods and crip war type like between Lunar and Sun even the Lunar was on the crips side her as a person is better. Being a crip slayer I have to say Lunar is not in charge of this war and she is only the idol. Her personality is actually lit shes hella abusive and like this is the first bih Id like to get beat up by. Since shes famous to and im a clout chaser and whatever. The story was fair because I really did  not care about the story and I dont think their even was one besides the ending. I was hella depressed the episode before the ending but that comeback on the final episode got me fired up. It was the last episode though which sucks and I wish I could of watched more. Besides the last two episodes the anime story was 6 a fair.\\n\\n\r\nYo the art for this is actually really good. It was only 2007 but it seems like I was watching something in 2018. It was a ToraDora type animation and TBH this is better than toradora in my opinion. The girl from ToraDora is to much like a wild animal you feel but this main girl in this anime is an actual wild animal. Well it a mermaid which is like beastiality or something. Id rate this art a 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was 8 to the intro was really catchy and I miss it alot but tbh I wouldnt watch it again or something id listen to but it held its ground very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are lit. Nagasami was kind of dense but Kai on the other hand was my favorite character. I love how he flexed his tanks and subarines and all his cash and he had so many girls. It was like ricegum was in this. The astronaut helmet and costume was lit to and was a good creative idea cause like that never happens before. That cop girl who kept snitching on them all though I disliked but I would ship that cop girl with Kai because they are like opposites and the cop girl is like not a gold digger like everyone else. Like the third to last episode with Kai was lit cause everyone bowed down to him as king and everyone on TV was like his fans. He just keeps flexing and it is legit the most lit thing ever. That was only Kai and I think Chimp is Equally as good. So I liked chimp cause he was figuratively a monkey. He legit is like pervy but wise at the same time. I love how he always switch sides between Suns and Lunars side. This dood legit is a servant to Kai because he gets cash from him. Another character is ms. Irrelevant I aint say her name cause I do not lik her. The girl with green hair not the class rep but the one with the swrod. She hella disrespectfal and is like the ops. It finna insane. So I was confused how this was TV-Ma and it was a middle school comedy???? Anyway the adults were helle funny to. Masa was cool because he is like hella smooth and hot. This was enjoying so I give the character and enjoyment a 10 and the overalll a 8. This is because of the story but overal id watch again. Thx for watching my reviews and make sure to check out my MAL profile and add me thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The protagonist ends up being badass, the girl is lovely and the harem hijinks are funny to see. Main girl's dad is pretty brutal but in a funny way. He's the parody of Yakuza thugs. I especially like the Shark guy wanting to eat everything. As I said before in the final arc the MC goes badass to save the girl he cares about and that's amazing.\r\nSound is pretty good while average, art is also average but by Gonzo standards it's excellent.It's funny how the artstyle become Hokuto no Ken like during some phases. Overall an AMAZING comedy filled woth heartwarming and badass moments. A must watch.",

At first, when Nagasumi was drowning in the ocean and the mermaid comes to the rescue, I was really corny and It didn't really hit me as anything spectacular. However, halfway through the first episode i was already hooked. And I mean to say, HOOKED!\r\nSome people may not understand the type of humor they use and I'm sorry for you. This is a spectacular anime. Now I guess i'll chip it up into different sections and judge it from there.\r\nStory: The story was and is very good. I love every part of it; thelove triangles, the sudden plot twists, and the suspense. (Yes, there is a little bit of suspense in the series. Even though it's a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is astonishing. At first glance at the show my reaction was, &quot;wow, i could take a screenshot and print a poster for myself.&quot; The background is drawn very well, details included, and the characters are beautiful. Even Saru.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I love the soundtrack. It really helps build the tone and atmosphere are the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters are great, great, absolutely great. In the whole show there is not a character that i hate. I loved every single character. Each character has their own charm and different attitudes. (Obviously) But i want to point out that the characters aren't static. In fact theye are quite dynamic and go through metamorphosis. Nagasume becomes a man; The class president goes through an emotional change; and even Gozaburo, San's father, changes a bit towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a must watch if you want hours or stomach-clutching humor.",

            "content": "Anime: My Bride is a Mermaid\r\nGenre: Harem, Romantic Comedy\r\nAge Rating: Good for all.\r\nStudio: Gonzo, AIC\r\nMusic: Yasuharu Takanashi\r\nAuthor: Tahiko Kimura\r\nDub/Sub: Dub\r\nEcchi Level: Otaku (A few characters like to show plenty of cleavage)\r\nOoOoO\r\nFound this on someone's favorite anime list, and I'm a sucker for mermaids in mythology so I had to check it out. And so I did. And here I am, reviewing it for you.\r\nSo now we have a comedy about a young man, engaged to the daughter of a mermaid mob boss. A boss who wants nothing more than the death of Nagasumi himself for taking away his daughter. And the comedy in this seriesis fantastic. It's been a long time since I laughed as hard as I did during this anime. The ceaseless struggle for Nagasumi to try and spend time with his wife, while fighting off her father and his henchmen was almost a perfect balance.\\n\\n\r\nThrow into the mix a the head of the junior high discipline squad, a pop idol, a chimp boy, a submarine millionaire, and a literal terminator, and the result left my jaw aching. The characters each felt unique and the voice actors all played their parts amazingly well. Aside from the fact that the show basically proves that Chris Sabat is in every goddamn anime ever, it also sees actors that I personally haven't heard from as much, such as Alexis Tipton (Sekirei's Musube) and John Swasey (Who did a bunch of voices in the original Dirty Pair).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was incredible as well, and switched styles almost on the spot to comedic effect. Each style it changed to fit the comedic moment perfectly, whether it was Nagasumi running for dear life from his future father-in-law, or a dramatic moment between characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, I would like to say that the villain at the end is almost...too cliche. Not saying I didn't enjoy the final few episodes, but to try and push this narrative they made Nagasumi act entirely out of character, which was a bit weird. So yeah, if I had any complaints, then there they are. In order for the final episode to take place, the protagonist had to act sorely out of character, and the villain is a decades old anime trope to be sure.\\n\\n\r\nBut with those out of the way, I can't really say I disliked anything about the show. I do wish they had gone a bit more in depth with the relationships between the other girls, but it wasn't necessary for me to be satisfied by this mermaid funfest. I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys comedic anime.\\n\\n\r\nOoOoO\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: This anime is funny, and you should watch it. If you like romance (or what manga artists believe romance is anyway...) and comedy, then this is a top marks recommendation from me. The story is simple and not too overly intense, so you can just sit back and enjoy the comedy. I'd compare it to something like FLCL, but with less...random stuff out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nOoOoO\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER TALK:\\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Iina Chiyo. Otherwise known as Class Rep. Yes, I know your name, and you never got your chance to shine. T-T The few episodes where she was prominent were pretty good, and her amazon personality when her glasses come off is also hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, I was slightly disappointed at the fact that none of the other parts of this so-called harem were really explored. Class Rep got a single day to spend with him, Lunar got nearly no time at all after the fiasco mid-season, and Mawari got fuck all. They just all the sudden accepted that they weren't going to win against Sun. Which hey, awesome on the more level-headed characters. But missing out on more character's gooey feelingness kinda sucks. But, the ending was amazing at least. Gotta say, I did not see that coming at all, and it was totally the right path to take. Go Nagasumi.",

The characters have all have their own quirks and foibles(San-chan's sakura petals appearing out of nowhere for instance, and Nagasumi's first kiss - I laughed so hard I got cramps), but these traits enhance the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest plus points for this anime is the ending. All too often in anime we see a great series end with a whimper. Not here. The ending was brilliant in both it's seriousness and it's humour - in other words it's seriously funny. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this series to anyone who likes jaw dropping, side splitting, mind boggling humour. I have laughed as much since I first watched Inukami - now there's ashow that's SO wrong :D",

            "content": "First off, I would like to get this straight. I am not a huge fan of romance anime's, throw in a harem in the way, then just forget about it . Now, dont get me wrong. I am not saying this anime breaks away from the tired formula of harems, in fact it has the word cliche written all over it. But what separates this anime from the rest, is  how it uses those cliche to its advantage.\r\nRead the synopsis, an average student gets forcibly married to the girl. We all know how those goes, right? Yes, the plot has been done a hundredtimes before and its teeming with stereotypical characters. Even each individual episode is predictable, as the anime goes through any harem anime would. Throughout the anime more girls come to like the protagonist, more fan service. its all textbook execution.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake here. Yes, the episode start out predictable at first, but you have no idea what Seto is capable of. It will go from cliche and then takes a huge step forward and jump to embellished. It has a fast paced and frankly, I liked it.\\n\r\nIts a nice change of pace. You get to laugh non-stop in a whole episode.\\n\\n\r\nI have no qualms for the sound and animation, as it does not pursue to be anything different. The animation is what you expect it to be in an anime(gravity defying hairs, radiant character designs) and the sound does nothing to stand out for me to mention anything. But from the start of the OP, it tells you that the anime will make you laugh.\\n\\n\r\nBut one of the key factors of why Seto No Hanayome is so downright hilarious is its brilliant application of the K.I.S.S theory. Seto No Hanayome is by no means a laid-back anime, but at the same time, there is no dull moment here as every moment is hectic enough for you to go &quot;lmfao!&quot;. It tries to be what it can and should be, simple and funny. Because of this, the formula works.The anime is all about comedy, nothing else. It wont throw you any cheap drama just for the hell of having it. Although because its lackluster for romance, it becomes a turn off people who hunger for something amatory. But that doesnt mean the relationship between Nagasumi and San doesnt develop, its just a little late thanks to the rest of the female cast that constantly grasps Nagasumi's attention.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong points of Seto is its parodies. Its derision ranges from Japanese Culture to American, heck, it even makes fun of itself. Who wouldve thought that they actually include a Hokuto No Ken parody here? Not to mention Terminator. Every episode will have you tapping the floor at least once because of its unrelenting low-brow humor. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters also gives way for comedy, as each of one of them is provides comic antics albeit that all of it are horrifically trite. Whether its the over-protective father, the yandere, or the timid class president, they will all crack you up. Plus, the influence and interaction on each other have has a significance.And to my surprise, there is even character development. The typical lame protagonist not only goes through a transition, but something you can never imagine. He is able to mature, and he erase whatever bad impression you have for harem male leads.\\n\\n\r\nSeto No Hanayome adds nothing new to the genre. It is another recycling of harem anime's. But its sheer presence of comedy is outstanding that you'll pay no attention to its unoriginal qualities. For the first time in a long time, a harem is done right.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Seto No Hanayome is the romantic comedy that you have been looking for. Its rollicking, its over-the top and its just plain straightforward. To say its funny, would be an understatement. This is cliche at its best.",

            "content": "Seto no Hanayome is a Romantic, Comedy about a young boy who was saved from drowning by a beautiful mermaid and according to mermaid law, he/she must die. However to escape their wrath, he decides to marry her but this will eventually cause more problems. The premise of the show may be that of an average Romantic Comedy but it is so enjoyably fun to watch that it doesn&rsquo;t matter.\r\nThat is basically how the story begins and from that point on there really isn&rsquo;t any storyline that moves the series along, but just a bunch of random cliched settings that every anime fan is familiarwith. That&rsquo;s not all, as this anime happens to move so fast that you can easily forget what joke was made a couple minutes ago but that is the style that works well with the show. Even though this is a romantic comedy, it is the comedy that is prominent throughout and it is the various parodies, which allows this unlikely show to rival the more popular series such as: Excel Saga and Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in this anime are great in their own individual way however out of all of them it is the male protagonist that truly stands out. Not only that he brings out the comedy from the characters around him but he also manages to act in a believable manner and he always ends up saying what we might be thinking, at the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is really hard to describe, where at times it can look piss poor there are also times it looks great, but this is really just to suit the whacky nature of the show. The action parody moments are the times when the animation truly shines and it's those moments which are to look forward to. On the other hand the music is decent, nothing amazing or special about it but good enough to gain merit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Seto no Hanayome is one of those anime series, appearing every now and again, that may seem average but manages to surpass your expectations. This proved to be one of the most enjoyable comedy anime series of the year 2007, with plenty of laughs to be had. Yet it was lacking in the story department, to allow it to reach the same level of other popular Parody Rom/Coms (Fumoffu?). Nonetheless, as a comedy, this is one you must see.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "DO NOT watch this anime in public (especially when you are surrounded by people, ie. library @ school, internet cafe, or wherever) unless you want to embarrass yourself due to uncontrollable laughing-out-loud (a real LOL). Consider yourself warned!\r\nTo start it off, I consider Seto no Hanayome a masterpiece of its genre(s). It is unfortunate that Seto no Hanayome was aired at the same time as Lucky Star, as some of its glory was \"drowned\" by it.\r\nStory:\r\nThere isn't much of a storyline to really talk about for Seto no Hanayome except for how everything got started (which you can read from the synopsis above). After that,each episode basically consists of random events follow by some more ridiculously stupid events and help bring us to the end. However, these little the bits and pieces of randomness does build up quite well overtime and give us a broad picture of not only the main casts, but the general surrounding environment as well. However, each mini story are all very well thought out and made my guts cry in pain (due to uncontrollable laughter).\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt is quite obvious that the animation crew have put in a lot of effort to make the viewers enjoy the show in different perspectives. They are very clever in the sense that know WHEN to over-emphasize on character expressions to make the show hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is pretty catchy, but overall there isn't anything that I can recall to be particularly outstanding. Although the occasional theme music matches very well with whatever that is going on in that episode. I also love the music that accompanies  San's chivalrous moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAll characters (the main and supporting casts) are all unique in their own way and they all help contribute to the parody of the show. Due to the lack of story, Seto no Hanayome actually end up with plenty of room for character developments and they did a very good job at that. One can feel the \"liveliness\" of each character as they mature throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Overall:\\n\r\nCome to think of it, I have never rated an anime (especially one with virtually NO main story plot) a 9/10 overall. I am still pretty surprised at myself, but as I compare Seto no Hanayome to previous anime of the same genre that I have watched, it is hard to put them on the same level. Definitely a must watch for everyone who wants a laugh of their lifetime.",

            "content": "I can summarize this entire anime in one short phrase: AHHHHHHH! \r\nI kid you not, the show cannot go hardly a minute without an interjection or over-the-top exclamation. I seriously had a hard time getting into this mainly for that reason. Even though it was a rom/com/harem anime, a genre which I generally enjoy, this, however, I really had to fight to stay interested. \r\nThe overall story's main arc is developed by our hero meeting a mermaid during his summer vacation. Well, as you could expect, things don't work out too peacefully, and the story takes it from there - death, or marrying a (rathercute/nicely drawn) mermaid (the one that saved him). The story is summarized nicely in its panel here and any guesses you might have about how the story ends up will probably be correct, as this anime is, for lack of a better term, \"predictable\". \\n\r\nIt's pretty original; and probably the most redeeming part of this anime. I mean, what would you do if you were to be married-off at 14-15? \\n\r\nYou'll encounter other \"sub-arcs\" throughout the entire series, mostly encompassing two-to-three episodes, but overall, the main focus here is on the relationship between our hero and San (can't remember the boy's name at the moment); as these sub-arcs serve to only further advance the progress of the main arc. This is what really saves this anime from being a shouting train wreck. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the art a lot. Some of the funniest moments were when San or Luna were staring blankly at a situation or an event in front of them and they had their entire eyes glaze over and liken to the shade of their hair. There are really a lot of different art styles at play here and most are basically eye-candy. The characters movements aren't robotic and rusty, but are drawn rather eloquently. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound also added a comedic mixture to the characters. It's hard to describe exactly what I'm referring to, but you'll have to watch the series to find out. \\n\r\nBut, like I stated previously, the sound (a.k.a. \"the screaming\")was also a huge gripe. It singlehandedly ruined the enjoyment of this anime for me, probably because I found my ears bleeding halfway in to each episode. Turn down your speakers, volume, what have you, just turn it down, please. 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, the characters weren't all that great because they relied too much on the comedy that each of their personalities brought to the table. Which, at first was fresh and funny, and you thought to yourself, \"This is a good start, can't wait to see what new things they can come up with in the next episode for 'x' character.\" Problem is: they don't. Each character's comedy is like washing multiple loads of laundry: wash, rinse, and repeat. \\n\r\nThe only characters I found tolerable were, thankfully, San (because she has a lot of screen time) and Luna's father. \\n\r\nSan's comedy, unlike the rest was just oozing ignorance and awkwardness that you just couldn't not like it! Her character is somebody you root for because this is a harem; there is some competition for our hero. \\n\r\nLuna's father was just as funny because of the obvious reference to him as Arnold Schwarzenegger in the \"Terminator\" trilogy. It was hilarious to hear him say his lines and his actions towards the other characters were definitely Arnold-esque, and, I thought, very funny. I would easily vote him as the best character in the series. \\n\r\nOthers aren't so fortunate. Maki just ends up being extremely annoying and one-dimensional, which really is a shame because she had an opportunity to be a really intriguing character; Gozoburo (San's father) just screams all of his lines nonstop, and I can clearly picture the voice actor saying those lines surrounded by hundreds of bottles of water in the recording studio just gasping for breath and scratching his throat. Luna, ended up being just an odd character, the way that they drew her as \"crazy Luna\" was too much for me to be funny and it had the lasting effect of being generally creepy. PLUS SOME MORE SUB-PAR CHARACTERS! 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment was not a satisfactory one. If you take a look at how many episodes I watched, you'll see that I didn't watch all 26. The three that I didn't watch were episodes I turned off because I was just so fed-up with the so called \"humor\" that was recycled so many times it resembled garbage, the ridiculous amount of screaming, or just me thinking, \"Why was this even an episode? They could have used the money spent on this towards feeding the homeless.\"\\n\r\nThere were seldom, and very few bright spots, throughout the series. The love story was cute, but not as engaging as other animes out there, the comedy was VERY hit-and-miss, the story was okay, and most of the characters just wanted to make me pull my hair out. 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted so badly to get into this anime. After reading some reviews, I was so psyched to watch it! Well, either my expectations were too high or something else happened, because I could just not get into it. The potential was there, which makes it so frustrating: a fairly original story, a harem that's actually above average, a love story that's engrossing and cute, but all for not. \\n\r\nOverall, this anime tries too hard to be funny by forcing it down, into your ears with all the screaming dialog, the love story is under-represented, the vast majority of the characters are annoying, and nothing really happens, other than a few characters get introduced throughout the length of the series. But, you know when an anime's a definite miss when a reviewer thinks you could end it at episode 14 and not waste making 12 more episodes. 5/10.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes it is just nice to have a ordinary love story. A young man and a mermaid find one another and get engaged under pain of death. The father in-law sics a shark on the young man and calls him up in the middle of the night and whispers in a deep voice \u201cI am going to rip your frickin balls off\u201d. You know the usual father in-law type of things. O and I forgot the father in-law is part of the underwater Yakuza. Yea just another ordinary love story. \r\nThe show opens with a mermaid saving a young boys' life. The boys name isNagasumi and the mermaids name is San. Apparently there is a rule that if a human sees the true form of a mermaid that mermaid must die. Sans father isn't exactly crazy about that idea, so he comes up with a plan. He is going to kill Nagasumi. San and her mother are not in love with that plan so they come up with a new one. If Nagasumi marries San he will be part of the mermaid clan and the problem will be solved. Sans father doesn't want to loose his precious little girl to marriage so he comes up with a plan. He is going to kill Nagasumi. No one ever blames Sans father for being overly creative. From here the craziness ensues, plus you know all the attempted killings.\\n\\n\r\nMore than anything \u201cSeto no Hanayome\u201d is about nonstop comedy. I did find a lot of the show funny but the show is really NONSTOP comedy. The show just never lets up. Plenty of genuine moments of romance or storytelling are ruined by the shows need to tell a joke every second and a half. This is also the main reason why so many jokes are just pounded into the ground. The first time Nagasumi is almost killed, funny; 5 billionth time, not so much. The show does get better at knowing when to let up as time goes on but even at the end it is pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a shame that the show is so crazy most of the time because underneath all of it is actually a good romance. Most of the usual high school romance plot devices are used. Several girls have crushes on Nagasumi, love triangles, etc. The thing is these things are all down played so much it is almost as through they aren't there. Example, Kai is introduced a few episodes into the show. He has had a crush on San sense he was young and vows to steal San away from Nagasumi. He makes a big attempt on the first episode he is introduced but that is about it. He is still there for the rest of the show and he continues to hate Nagasumi but he really doesn't do anything to try to steal San away. I think he makes one attempt right before the end of the show but that is all. There are obvious complains to be made for introducing plot elements and then never really doing anything with them, but I really enjoy this approach. None of the clutter that usually comes with a romances are here. There isn't a group of girls pushing themselves on one guy episode after episode, you don't have two people who obviously like one another but take 15 episodes for one of them to say something, and even though they are both very dedicated to carrying out the promise of marriage neither are under some dilution of love at first site. So at the end of the day what you have is just a guy and a girl getting to know one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is, if nothing else, interesting. Everyone is pretty much insane in their own fashion. Nagasumi and San are easily the two most normal, but considering their competition that isn't necessarily saying a whole lot. San seems normal enough most of the time but other times she seems oblivious to situations including Nagasumis near death experiences. Nagasumi is freaking out for half of every episode, admittedly he is trying to be assassinated a lot of the time so it is somewhat justified. Individually these two are OK but together as a couple they really seem to shine. The rest of the cast plays their comical rolls. This isn't to say I didn't enjoy them or that they don't have personalities, because they definitely all have their own personalities. It is just that they don't really get any development and the part they play in the story is to setup jokes. The characters do go along with the none stop comical style of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe main fault of this show is that it tries too hard. Which is too bad because I did enjoy a lot of the comedy and there is a nice romance hidden in here. With the show just not knowing when to let up the comedy gets tiresome after a little while and too many moments that didn't need comedy are ruined. If you are someone who doesn't mind comedy that never lets up even in scenes were it probably should than I highly recommend it. You will have the comedy you love plus a decent romance. For anyone else my guess is you will start getting a little frustrated with the show before you get to the halfway point.",

I'm not a fan of the harem anime's from the start, and I didn't originally think this would be like that. \r\nHonestly it's best redeeming quality is the opening theme...\r\nIt's supposed to be funny, but I find it hard to watch due to the fact that basically every episode consists of yelling and screaming. And really, the whole trying-to-kill-Nagasumi thing gets old REALLY fast. A lot of things happen, but I haven't laughed at all, because it's more annoying than funny. \r\nThe story is hidden in the background ofthe attempted humour, and isn't all that great, either. \\n\r\nThe character are alright, but none of them stand out as unique. Nagasumi is no different from guys in other harem animes, and none of the characters are fresh. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound of the anime are the only things I enjoyed. I really wanted to get into it, but EVERY episode is the same. I'm not even finished the series yet, but I'm not sure I'll even be able to. \\n\r\nThey could have made this story really funny, and there is potential for it, but they fail.",

            "content": "My Bride is a Mermaid, wow, just wow.\r\nIn my life, I've only experienced exuberant mirth once.\r\nI found myself fallen from my chair, gripping the underside of my couch, asphyxiating from laughter, tears streaming down my cheeks as my sides burned in protest. I can truly, without a doubt, say that this show is a one of a kind comedic experience, and was it ever fun. \r\nSavvy, that's what My Bride is a Mermaid is.\r\nArtwork and Animation: 10\r\nMy Bride is a Mermaid covers an immense amount of animation styles. Given that it's part parody, many of these styles are directly inspired by other popular and wellknown series. There are several Jojo inspired bits, Fist of the North Star, Death Note, Naruto, the list goes on and on and on. Pop culture makes an enormous splash here too, with things like the Terminator. \\n\r\nOn top of all this, Mermaid manages to have its own style as well, which is rather cutesy and exaggerated, but lends itself well to the comedy. It's very fluid, very fast moving, with lots of GIANT EXPLODING BOLD TEXT, and small details that are easy to overlook that all add up into one massive reference filled laugh fest. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the definitive English dub experience, truly. An ensemble cast of industry veterans and new voices alike, Mermaid is absolutely riotous with these zany, extremely energetic performances. Todd Haberkorn (FMAB), Alexis Tipton, and Cherami Leigh head up a star studded cast of voice talent, and to great effect. The ubiquitous Monica Rial stands out as Maki, the pint sized, voracious mob assassin; Christopher Sabat as Masa, the smooth talking ladykiller right hand man; and finally John Swasey as Gozaburo Seto: constantly livid, definition-of-rage mob man to name a few other standouts. The voices are incredibly dynamic, engaging, and utterly hilarious, all the time. Never a dull moment with this group.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are great tunes, the ska-surf feel of the intro fits in perfectly with the ocean/sea theme, and the endings are cute. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nNagasumi Michishio is the quintessential \"short-legged, good for nothing, unimpressive\" middle school loser. He's got nothing going for him- he's a total klutz, goofy as they come, and has a penchant for getting himself into dangerous situations, which play off more and more hilariously as the series progresses. What he does have going for him, though, is heart. After he's saved from drowning by Sun Seto, his life takes a turn for the crazy, and all manner of undersea mishaps, misunderstandings, and sheer ludicrousity ensue. \\n\\n\r\nSun is a young mermaid, daughter of super dangerous mob boss Gozaburo Seto. Well meaning, but air-headed, Sun often generates as much trouble for Nagasumi as he does for himself, but she stays true, and is a very heartfelt character. She is often used as a foil for Nagasumi, Lunar, or Gozaburo, but she has plenty of moments to shine on her own, too.\\n\\n\r\nLunar: diva, pop star, and ferociously possessive to a violent level. She is the definition of cute psycho. One second she's an axe murdering bitch, the next she's an adorably narcissistic moe character. As Japan's biggest pop singer, another lover of Nagasumi's, and new student at school, Lunar adds yet another dimension of insanity to his previously mundane life. \\n\\n\r\nAbout half the supporting cast get nearly as much screen time as the main trio, but this section would be as long as the entire review if I went through all of them individually. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe basis for My Bride is a Mermaid is a subversion of the Shotgun Wedding. One misunderstanding piled on top of another typically form the crux of the conflict in this show, and while many RomComs follow an episodic style, Mermaid went with a full 26 episode story arc. While it goes off on some tangents, it's never unpleasant, because it's just so dang funny. \\n\r\nOne thing leads to another, and after Nagasumi is rescued by Sun, he's presented with an ultimatum: die, or... die. Under mermaid law, if any human sees them in their fish form, they're to be killed. Either that, or the mermaid who allowed their-self to be seen must be put to death... but when your dad is the most feared mob boss under the seas, that's not likely. There is a third option, however. The third option is that they get married. \\n\r\nSoon, Nagasumi's previously boring middle school existence is uprooted when his life is invaded by an entire mob family from under the sea, to uproarious results. They take over his school, his house, all aspects of his life- trying desperately (but failing) to kill him before this wedding happens. Thankfully for Nagasumi, the one thing he's good at is miraculously being able to avoid being eaten, chopped up, blown up, shot, stabbed, or otherwise destroyed. Let the games begin. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm no stranger to comedies, holding Seinfeld in the highest regard, but I have never seen a show before that has so consistently made me laugh so hard that I cried. There was not one episode that I didn't at least chuckle at. Full blown side clutching, tears streaming down were a common occurrence. I can't award enough points in enjoyment. The humor really clicked with me, and I've seen just enough film and anime to get a majority of the parodical elements, which really made the experience that much richer. \\n\\n\r\nThe Branchial Respiration Brothers Jojo remix.\\n\r\nLunar's Papa, The Terminator.\\n\r\nThe pop culture parody and clever satire, nobody is safe!\\n\r\nThe PUNS.\\n\\n\r\nMy Bride is a Mermaid has everything comedy. Despite being in a genre known only for its schlock, Mermaid breaks free of the Rom-Com mold by being FUNNY! A breath of fresh air from the other so called comedies, this one knows when to play it straight, when to lay everything out on the table, when to jump Shark Fujishiro, and how to take the laughter to stratospheric levels. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs an homage to the 80s Yakuza film craze, Mermaid starts out with a lot of comedic value. Taken further by the undersea theme- there's a TON of fodder with all the sea creature jokes and funnies. Mafias made up entirely of mermaids and fish? It's wacky, it's crazy, and it's SO much fun. Every moment is a favorite, it's endlessly quotable, and there's something that everyone will recognize and laugh at here. \\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely. As far as animated comedies go, this is my #1, forever. Overall, this one might beat out Seinfeld on a good day. It's really that funny.",

            "content": "I haven't done a review in a while, but every now and then a show pops up that just asks for it. Seto no Hanayome is one of those shows.\r\nSo you are looking for a show that can make you laugh? Look no further. Seto no Hanayome is just the thing for you! In all 26 episodes there hasn't been a single moment that made me consider putting it down. Its just too dang hilarious! No matter what situations the main characters end up in. One thing is guaranteed. And that is a good laugh. \r\nBut SnH manages to go beyond being a funny show.The story isn't really anything special. Its just your average sudden bride thing. But its the way they handle it. The easy way out would be putting the 2 in some awkward positions, drop in a rival or 2, and fill the rest up with fan service. And to be honest. to a point SnH does just that. But there is more to it. The main cast is just very lovable. Whether its the cute but naive San, The cute but deep down scary Luna, or the poor but lovable Nagasumi. You can't help but like them. But the side cast has its unique appeal as well. My personal favorites being Mawari and Shark, Fujishiro. The characters are used to their full potential, and its just hard to hate any one of them. And I almost forgot to mention the excellent voice acting! The story isn't that impressive, but it carries the show well, and the climax of the series is actually pretty dang impressive. For once we have a romantic comedy that actually gives you a feeling of closure. Even though there is still loads of potential for a second season *crosses fingers*\\n\\n\r\nAnother fun factor comes from the many references to other shows. Not just anime either. From Hokuto no Ken and JoJo's Bizarre adventure to the Terminator. Its hilarious to spot these references and certainly gives you a reason to watch the show more then once.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI could ramble on about it, but i suggest just checking it out. Its funny, its cute, and manly at the same time. Just give it a go, you'll thank me later.",

            "content": "I myself am not the biggest fan of the comedy genre, most of the comedy entries these days are bland and generic with no substance that will only get a slight giggle at best. But, Seto no Hanayome is different, it's a unique entry that actually made me laugh out loud on every single episode, which is amazing considering I don't like comedy.\r\n(There will be a tl;dr summary at the bottom for those who don't like to read)\r\n[LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD]\r\nThe story starts out with our protagonist Michishio Nagasumi, regarded by most as a useless person that shines in the most useless of ways in uselesssituations. He is on vacation on Seto island visiting his grandmother's. One day while he was at the beach, he went too far out and almost drowned, almost. He sees the image of what looks like a mermaid come to his aid, this mermaid was Seto Sun, the daughter of the Seto mermaid yakuza leader. Since Nagasumi saw Sun in her mermaid form, Sun has two options, she kills him and anyone else who saw her, or she marries him. \\n\\n\r\nThis sets up the series with a premise that allows for a lot of comedy to ensue, \"But wait\" you might ask, \"Hasn't this premise been done before in things like To Love Ru?\" You would be correct, but what separates Seto no Hanayome from the rest is the way that it executes its jokes.\\n\\n\r\nMost of them fall under the \"Ironic Comedy\" category, basically setting up a situation where you think you know what's going to happen next, like a girl trying to confess her feelings to a guy, then throwing a wrench in the works and giving you something completely different then what you expected. Another plot device that produces massive amounts of comedy is the fact that if any mermaid gets water on their legs, their legs turn back into mermaid form\\n\\n\r\nAlso, since this is a parody anime, there are many references and jokes correlating to their respective franchises, such as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Naruto, Dragonball Z, and even Evangelion and Sgt Frog.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the subject of comedy is completely subjective and what people find funny varies from person to person, it's hard to watch this show and not get a hard laugh out of it.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I had a gripe with at first was the art style, I could forgive the animation seeing as it was made 7 years ago, but the art style didn't click with me at first, especially the design of the main heroine, Sun. She has these bang-things that are on the top of her head that go all the way down to her chin, I'm not sure if this is how she was meant to be or if it's just making fun of similar hairstyles in other anime, because it does resemble a lot of hairstyles from Naruto. Another major gripe I had in general, which were the eyes of the characters, the eyes in particular don't sit well with me, they look like someone glued legos to their eyes. But I completely understand why they are the way they are, it's a parody anime, and the art styles of which tend to be on the goofy side of the spectrum, who knows, it might be a light jab at other parody anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that makes this series great is its cast of characters, as generic as they may be. I'll start with Seto Sun, the main heroine of the series and love interest of Nagasumi, she comes off as somewhat of an airhead at times but shows a strong passion towards Nagasumi, with the sword skills of a master and a code of honor comparable to that of a medieval knight. Yes, as much as this show likes to flaunt it's comedy around, it really does have solid characters and character development. \\n\\n\r\nI might sound like a broken record at this point, but there's another pro of this anime, that being its soundtrack. It has many tracks that are only played on only one or two episodes, which gives the soundtrack lots of variety, one of my personal favorites being \u7028\u6236\u4e4b\u82b1\u5ac1-Your Gravitation, which is the song that Seto Sun sings at about the halfway point of the series. It has these tracks that really do enhance the comedy as well as make the scenes of romance that more impactful. Hell, even some of the tracks are a parody, the track Hageshii Uta has a striking resemblance to Through the Fire and Flames by Dragonforce oddly enough.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr: Seto no Hanayome is a unique entry in the rom-com genre that really hits home with the execution of its comedy and overall enjoyment with great music and lots of rewatch potential.",

            "content": "Let me go out on a limb here and say this. This anime is with no contest the funniest anime I have ever seen. I'm not really a \"lol\" person but this anime genuinely made me laugh..... a lot.\r\nUnfortunately, the story itself is a little cliched. Man forced into marriage due to punishment of death and in laws don't like it blah blah blah irrelevant. Seto is different due to the fact that it doesn't need an engaging story to be an engaging anime. The rest of it's features more than make up for the story and therefore make it irrelevant.\r\nThere was something that mademe fall in love with the art style. At times, it seemed normal, then it became ridiculous and over the top (especially when the main character Nagasumi is being viciously attacked, which happens all the time). The fact that in the funnier scenes, the characters looked ridiculous added to the stupid humour of the whole scene. An amplification, if you will. \\n\\n\r\nSound does it's job, with a catchy musical score. I like the background Western style music that's played when something \"manly\" happens and the harmonica thing that plays with something more depressing or the appearance of one of my favourite characters, Masa-san. Voice acting is amazing, with many characters (especially Lunar and Maki, changing their voices, from something normal, to something strange, which is funny)\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters are what really shine. You have the main guy Nagasumi, who I really feel sorry for. Damn near every main girl character in the cast is in love with him, which makes for some great scenarios, which don't exactly end well for Nagasumi, especially when he is suspected of cheating (then again, I would love to be in his position!). Then you have San, who is a girl who is quite dense but with a chivalrous spirit which really shines. Her love for Nagasumi is very admirable and I'm glad the two of them are the main pairing. Then we have Lunar, who is an interesting character, as her personality completely changes depending on the situation to suit her. She is an idol with a tough life, being beaten by San in every way, including Nagasumi, who she loves, but doesn't show it.\\n\r\nSan's family is great, most of them hate Nagasumi (apart from two I believe) which makes for some great moments when Nagasumi is nearly killed or ordered to be killed. San's mother stands out as the protector/mentor for Nagasumi, it's especially satisfying to see her effortlessly stop her husband's murderous efforts. I love the character of Masa, who makes Nagasumi's face change to one of total love due to an unfortunate incident with CPR (Nagasumi's first kiss), which is an awesome running gag.\\n\r\nThe classroom characters are also good and well fleshed out. You have Mawari, who is a little unbelievable in how righteous she is, but can be funny, she treats any boy's advances as being perverted, even accidental ones. Then you have Kai and Saru, who go well together, in a sort of master servant bro-mance way (Saru's perverted nature makes for great laughs). You have the Class President, a hidden gem as she goes unnoticed the majority of the time, but then turns out to be great looking without the thick glasses. Her lonely nature and her bad luck make her one of my favourite characters. Overall, I love all the characters as they add to the hilarious experience.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment was fantastic with every episode having many reasons to watch it again. My favourite episode was 21, and without revealing much, it involves love letters, magic potion, extreme love, extreme hate, and some bad luck. WATCH THAT EPISODE IF NO OTHER!\\n\\n\r\nI love this anime, I hope for more, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves romance, and laughs.\\n\\n",

No cahracter development, no story. They could have shortened the plot to 3 episodes, the rest are filler episodes.\r\nStory: I missed the complexity. The characters are stupid, childish and stereotype.\r\nThere is a wimpy main character who takes all the blame , even if hes not a fault, having no spine till the last episode. Plus he is whining in EVERY episode.\r\nThat is not very masculine...however he gets all the nice girls (Harem).\r\nI won't talk about the others, becauseI wouldn't write a good word.\\n\\n\r\nIf your older than 12 yr you shouldn't waste your time.\\n\r\nThere are plenty of good animes (except this one of course).\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS ANIME IS AMAZING!!!!!!!\r\nSeriously I just finished watching it for the 3rd time and I've come to the conclusion that this anime is perhaps the most underrated anime of all time. Not only does the current 7.88 score on mal confuse the heck out of me, it also makes me disappointed that some people may see that score and be turned away by it, although it's not \"low\", it doesn't do this anime justice. This anime is among the best, among the big boys and definitely a classic that has stood the test of time, I watched this is 2018, it came out in 2007,and I somehow felt like I'm seeing something new and refreshing, absolute fantastic masterpiece that would guarantee you a great time, I'll tell you why.\\n\\n\r\nIt proves that you really can't judge a book by its cover, or review on MAL.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple and easy to comprehend, although pretty crazy, I won't explain the whole thing but you should go into this anime with no expectations and no pre-thought about it. The story build up is amazing as well, for such a weird plot, it's surprisingly comprehensible and intriguing as anime takes its time to set up the story and characters so you care and actually like them.\\n\\n\r\nThe humour in this series is absolutely amazing, every episode is funny asf and jokes never get old. This anime also has some of the funniest and wackiest expressions you'll ever see, which is definitely a bonus. Especially once shit really goes down around episode 5-20\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is there I guess but that's not the full point of this anime, some people consider this a \"harem\" but it's not like that yuck shit at all. It's a full on comedy series that could use a little romance here and there but the romance is just a key factor towards the comedy as well. Don't be expecting some squeaky harem shit, these are all respectable characters that have their dignities straight .\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are so lovable and there's not one that lacks behind another, they're all intricately designed and crafted so that they differentiate between each other and have their own charms and wacky senses, fucking amazing. P.s characters in this are not all introduced straight away \\n\\n\r\n*The animation in this series, although nothing special at first, immediately starts to hit you, it's absolutely masterful, each frame is crafted to perfection and the directing is amazing as well, with camera angles being spot on and clear to the scene.\\n\r\n*The art style is also so unbelievably great as well, everytime when the basic animation and set design is about to get old they throw some good shit at you, like a jojo parody or even a comic book style car chase, it's really rare to see an anime this creative and smart these days, which is a shame as this shit is reeaaaally fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe best I can compare this to is buellers day off, where it's a crazy comedy with crazy shit happening, but it's not TOO stupid and outrageous that people could think its for kids. This is for a mature audience that knows how to laugh and have a good time \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, perhaps the funniest and most entertaining rom com anime you'll ever watch, don't let the strange introduction throw you off. You know that feeling when you first start a new fresh anime series and you like all pumped up and shit? yeah this anime is like that for every episode you watch throughout the 26 episodes as well as a few ovas. Every episode is expertly crafted and made to maximize your entertainment. Go have a watch right now, trust me you will not regret it.",

            "content": "I'm bad with reviews, and the top reviews are most likely what people will only see, but I'll still write one.  Seto No Hanayome is hands down, the best romcom that I have seen, that uses the usual cliche comedy mechanics, and uses them in a way that is enjoyable AND funny, without being dry or dull.  The story never had a dull moment and had a lot of humorous moments.  There were even references to real-life movies which were fun to figure out and were funny if you understood what they meant or at least, what they were attempting to replicate.\r\nThedescription of Seto No Hanayome is perfect in describing this show, Ill just leave it at that.   The story, was easy to follow.  Its pretty straight forward and only has a few flashback moments.   The art was a bit old, but I enjoy that style.   They had various forms of it as well, so they can be super detailed and serious, or it could be like how Lucky Star is and thus be not so super detailed.   The sounds, were perfect!   They used the best choice of sound effects and music clips, for the various situations which made the scenes so much funnier.  Characters were all loveable and unique enough to differentiate.   Enjoyment, 10/10   \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime a lot and am extremely grateful to have watched it.   However, I'm only giving it a 10.    The sad part, is that MAL, does not let us give ratings above 10, so I'm forced to give it a 10.  Oh well.",

            "content": "So I was on funimation viewing comedy anime's and I found this. I wanted to watch this because I was confused cause I did not think mermaids existed in Japan but I guess they do. To be honest I did not find the mermaids \"hot\". Maybe this is because they were in like middle school with pissed me off. Look that was everything I thought in beginning but until I got passed episode 1 It was actually lit. The abusive dad to Nagasami is hella gold and I did not think to show would get better than that. Until they went to school like Idid not even know mermaids went to school. I was #lmao the whole time. It must suk tho to have your parents work at your school like I know she a girl but that hella lame I would not hit that tbh. Id rather tap that ah, on Lunar. You see even though during this series their was a bloods and crip war type like between Lunar and Sun even the Lunar was on the crips side her as a person is better. Being a crip slayer I have to say Lunar is not in charge of this war and she is only the idol. Her personality is actually lit shes hella abusive and like this is the first bih Id like to get beat up by. Since shes famous to and im a clout chaser and whatever. The story was fair because I really did  not care about the story and I dont think their even was one besides the ending. I was hella depressed the episode before the ending but that comeback on the final episode got me fired up. It was the last episode though which sucks and I wish I could of watched more. Besides the last two episodes the anime story was 6 a fair.\\n\\n\r\nYo the art for this is actually really good. It was only 2007 but it seems like I was watching something in 2018. It was a ToraDora type animation and TBH this is better than toradora in my opinion. The girl from ToraDora is to much like a wild animal you feel but this main girl in this anime is an actual wild animal. Well it a mermaid which is like beastiality or something. Id rate this art a 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was 8 to the intro was really catchy and I miss it alot but tbh I wouldnt watch it again or something id listen to but it held its ground very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are lit. Nagasami was kind of dense but Kai on the other hand was my favorite character. I love how he flexed his tanks and subarines and all his cash and he had so many girls. It was like ricegum was in this. The astronaut helmet and costume was lit to and was a good creative idea cause like that never happens before. That cop girl who kept snitching on them all though I disliked but I would ship that cop girl with Kai because they are like opposites and the cop girl is like not a gold digger like everyone else. Like the third to last episode with Kai was lit cause everyone bowed down to him as king and everyone on TV was like his fans. He just keeps flexing and it is legit the most lit thing ever. That was only Kai and I think Chimp is Equally as good. So I liked chimp cause he was figuratively a monkey. He legit is like pervy but wise at the same time. I love how he always switch sides between Suns and Lunars side. This dood legit is a servant to Kai because he gets cash from him. Another character is ms. Irrelevant I aint say her name cause I do not lik her. The girl with green hair not the class rep but the one with the swrod. She hella disrespectfal and is like the ops. It finna insane. So I was confused how this was TV-Ma and it was a middle school comedy???? Anyway the adults were helle funny to. Masa was cool because he is like hella smooth and hot. This was enjoying so I give the character and enjoyment a 10 and the overalll a 8. This is because of the story but overal id watch again. Thx for watching my reviews and make sure to check out my MAL profile and add me thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The protagonist ends up being badass, the girl is lovely and the harem hijinks are funny to see. Main girl's dad is pretty brutal but in a funny way. He's the parody of Yakuza thugs. I especially like the Shark guy wanting to eat everything. As I said before in the final arc the MC goes badass to save the girl he cares about and that's amazing.\r\nSound is pretty good while average, art is also average but by Gonzo standards it's excellent.It's funny how the artstyle become Hokuto no Ken like during some phases. Overall an AMAZING comedy filled woth heartwarming and badass moments. A must watch.",

At first, when Nagasumi was drowning in the ocean and the mermaid comes to the rescue, I was really corny and It didn't really hit me as anything spectacular. However, halfway through the first episode i was already hooked. And I mean to say, HOOKED!\r\nSome people may not understand the type of humor they use and I'm sorry for you. This is a spectacular anime. Now I guess i'll chip it up into different sections and judge it from there.\r\nStory: The story was and is very good. I love every part of it; thelove triangles, the sudden plot twists, and the suspense. (Yes, there is a little bit of suspense in the series. Even though it's a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is astonishing. At first glance at the show my reaction was, &quot;wow, i could take a screenshot and print a poster for myself.&quot; The background is drawn very well, details included, and the characters are beautiful. Even Saru.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I love the soundtrack. It really helps build the tone and atmosphere are the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters are great, great, absolutely great. In the whole show there is not a character that i hate. I loved every single character. Each character has their own charm and different attitudes. (Obviously) But i want to point out that the characters aren't static. In fact theye are quite dynamic and go through metamorphosis. Nagasume becomes a man; The class president goes through an emotional change; and even Gozaburo, San's father, changes a bit towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a must watch if you want hours or stomach-clutching humor.",

            "content": "Anime: My Bride is a Mermaid\r\nGenre: Harem, Romantic Comedy\r\nAge Rating: Good for all.\r\nStudio: Gonzo, AIC\r\nMusic: Yasuharu Takanashi\r\nAuthor: Tahiko Kimura\r\nDub/Sub: Dub\r\nEcchi Level: Otaku (A few characters like to show plenty of cleavage)\r\nOoOoO\r\nFound this on someone's favorite anime list, and I'm a sucker for mermaids in mythology so I had to check it out. And so I did. And here I am, reviewing it for you.\r\nSo now we have a comedy about a young man, engaged to the daughter of a mermaid mob boss. A boss who wants nothing more than the death of Nagasumi himself for taking away his daughter. And the comedy in this seriesis fantastic. It's been a long time since I laughed as hard as I did during this anime. The ceaseless struggle for Nagasumi to try and spend time with his wife, while fighting off her father and his henchmen was almost a perfect balance.\\n\\n\r\nThrow into the mix a the head of the junior high discipline squad, a pop idol, a chimp boy, a submarine millionaire, and a literal terminator, and the result left my jaw aching. The characters each felt unique and the voice actors all played their parts amazingly well. Aside from the fact that the show basically proves that Chris Sabat is in every goddamn anime ever, it also sees actors that I personally haven't heard from as much, such as Alexis Tipton (Sekirei's Musube) and John Swasey (Who did a bunch of voices in the original Dirty Pair).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was incredible as well, and switched styles almost on the spot to comedic effect. Each style it changed to fit the comedic moment perfectly, whether it was Nagasumi running for dear life from his future father-in-law, or a dramatic moment between characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, I would like to say that the villain at the end is almost...too cliche. Not saying I didn't enjoy the final few episodes, but to try and push this narrative they made Nagasumi act entirely out of character, which was a bit weird. So yeah, if I had any complaints, then there they are. In order for the final episode to take place, the protagonist had to act sorely out of character, and the villain is a decades old anime trope to be sure.\\n\\n\r\nBut with those out of the way, I can't really say I disliked anything about the show. I do wish they had gone a bit more in depth with the relationships between the other girls, but it wasn't necessary for me to be satisfied by this mermaid funfest. I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys comedic anime.\\n\\n\r\nOoOoO\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: This anime is funny, and you should watch it. If you like romance (or what manga artists believe romance is anyway...) and comedy, then this is a top marks recommendation from me. The story is simple and not too overly intense, so you can just sit back and enjoy the comedy. I'd compare it to something like FLCL, but with less...random stuff out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nOoOoO\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER TALK:\\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Iina Chiyo. Otherwise known as Class Rep. Yes, I know your name, and you never got your chance to shine. T-T The few episodes where she was prominent were pretty good, and her amazon personality when her glasses come off is also hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, I was slightly disappointed at the fact that none of the other parts of this so-called harem were really explored. Class Rep got a single day to spend with him, Lunar got nearly no time at all after the fiasco mid-season, and Mawari got fuck all. They just all the sudden accepted that they weren't going to win against Sun. Which hey, awesome on the more level-headed characters. But missing out on more character's gooey feelingness kinda sucks. But, the ending was amazing at least. Gotta say, I did not see that coming at all, and it was totally the right path to take. Go Nagasumi.",

            "content": "Very rarely does an Anime come along and make me laugh this much. Seto no Hanayome does a great job at it and I'm sure I'm not the only one.\r\nStory: It sounds cliche the whole \"guy forced into marriage\" thing. Normally this would bother me because I get sick of these types of premises but the show makes up for it with great jokes and fun characters. The episodes themselves follow the day-by-day plot. Where each episode either introduces a new character or they just deal with stuff. No real plot here. Unfortunately, the end was a bit rushed and disappointing. There was no buildupto it and it was mainly one of those \"We need to end the series on a serious note\" kind of things. It didn't work for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I think the earlier episodes looked pretty bad. One side of a character's face would not be proportional to the other side but when a joke happens, the animation's great. The chibis are fine. The animators definitely put some effort on the scenes that needed funny visually though. A lot of the repeat visual jokes work because of how these scenes look. Unfortunately, the overall animation quality isn't very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The background tracks were pretty good. I wish there was an ost. The opening and endings are great songs as well as the insert songs. As for the voice acting, the cast did a spectacular job. Momoi Haruko who does Sun has so many voice shifts (regular, chibi, tough guy, singing, etc.), so it was interesting to listen to and see the talent. The other characters are voiced well too. A lot of the cast are voices you'd recognize and they do a great job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: A few of them annoyed me but overall the characters are fun and enjoyable to watch. Due to the plotless-ness of most of these episodes, the character interactions make the show a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Some episodes weren't so great but the series was a good watch. I laughed so hard. I even re-watch certain scenes to brighten my day.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This series is gold. I would recommend this to any fan of comedy. Although I suppose most Anime fans would enjoy it. There are two Ovas in addition to this series which were also pretty fun to watch. I'm hoping for a second season since this definitely deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review. Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Hope this helped.",

            "content": "Seto no Hanayome is fast-paced, random and hilarious anime at its finest.  It is one of the funniest animes I have personally seen and I've had to pause multiple times while watching due to uncontrollable laughter.  \r\nThe story is about a young man named Nagasumi who's saved by a mermaid named Seto San and due to various circumstances related to her being a mermaid (and also sort of belonging to a triad family), he is forced into marriage with her.  Throughout the anime you will meet absolutely hilarious characters including an overly protective father in law (think crazy triad leader obsessed withhis daughter) and a cute little fairy type creature (looks can be deceiving!).  \\n\\n\r\nBasically it is a romantic comedy, with more comedy than romance, and the storyline suffers a bit from side tracking to different plots surrounding the different characters you meet along the way.  There wasn't really a main plot in this anime, more like a collection of stories about Nagasumi and San's romantic adventures. However, this was absolutely a great thing because all the characters you meet are really funny and interact with each other quite well and in hilarious ways.  Another thing I really appreciated about this anime was the fact that it did not have an overbearingly dramatic romantic plot line near the end like alot of romantic comedies you find nowadays (I find alot of these animes tend to be less funny near the ending due to this).  Instead, the laughter wont stop until you finish the last episode with Seto no Hanayome.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a comedy with heavy amounts of romance in it, Seto no Hanayome is probably not for you, but if you are looking for a comedy along the lines of Azumanga Daioh, this is one you should strongly consider watching.",

            "content": "It's a romantic comedy particularly light on the romance. I had the odd chuckle here or there, but overall the comedy was just passable.\r\nStory: \r\nThe premise is that a yakuza mermaid is forced into a marriage with the boy she saved or else either one of them is forced to die. There's honestly no real story because there's no real looming threat or end in sight. Anything that happens in the show is just a means to add in more comedic situations. The show's main source of comedy is misunderstandings and overreactions that lead into lots of yelling and beatings at the expense of themain character. They add variety by adding in a new character every few episodes which leads to more conflict, more yelling, and ultimately little development. The romance doesn't evolve past a few group dates and hand holding because there's always a side character cock blocking them and the couple really don't try particularly hard to get close to one another anyways. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe male protagonist is your typical kid that stumbles into a harem full of mermaids and nutjobs. He's actually noted in-story to be fairly average looking and a little short with nothing particularly special about him other than the occasional kind gesture. The main female lead is supposed to be very chivalrous and a bit of an airhead, but perfect overall. The male lead thinks about becoming someone truly worth marrying her, but sort of brushes it off until the last two episodes. The whole cast in general is shallow and one dimensional. They each have their own quirks which are at least entertaining enough to watch though a couple may just come off as nothing more than annoying obstacles for the main protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nProduction:\\n\r\nThere's nothing special to speak of. The character designs are passable and the animation gets the job done. They do lampshade their lack of animation budget a bit when they completely censor huge fight scenes or when they literally substitute in stick figures.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt was alright. Nothing particularly special, but nothing really jarring either. I tried to be objective as possible, but at the end of the day this show boils down to a simple comedy which is extremely subjective. Watch a few episodes and decide for yourself because it doesn't change much from there.",

            "content": "With all the hype around most popular animes these days, and mainstream entertainment in general, I thought that this anime was going to be medicore at best. I couldn't have been more wrong. No matter how many animes you've watched, what your age is or how experienced and knowledgeable you are when it comes to anime, this series will utterly and completely suprise you. By the time the last episode finishes you will be crying and laughing at the same time because this truly is a dramatic-romantic-comedy. \r\nThe plot may seem all too familiar, a nice girl from a powerful and wealthy familly is forcedto marry a nobody through a chain of weird events and now everyone's out to get him. What makes it work in this anime is the dazzling originality. The \"tie your son-in-law to a rock and throw him into the sea\" kind of originality or my favourite \"Hey look! There's a submarine surfacing in the middle of a city commanded by a teenage admiral! Let's all just pretend it's a normal every day occurrence!\". This anime had me laughing all the time and I had to limit the amount of episodes I was watching every day, because of severe stomach ache. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are hilarious to say the least. First, the male protagonist - Nagasumi. On the surface, he appears to be a spineless indecisive layman prone to getting himself into all sorts of trouble. And while most of that is actually true he has his moments of glory when he decides to man up and face his problems  in a grown-up way. This is especially true later on in the series, where we can see his transition from a boy to a real man. Still, he's spineless most of the time... and indecisive. \\n\\n\r\nSan is a clumsy airhead who charges into problems head-on. As you've probably read in the synopsis she's the one who saves Nagasumi and chooses to marry him, so that his life is spared from a certain execution. She provides a good chunk of the comedy in here and gets nagasumi into a lot of trouble, especially with her father.\\n\\n\r\nSan's familly is bizarre. Her father's always there to rage about pretty much everything but his sole purpose in this anime is to shadow nagasumi's every step and make sure he's not mistreating his daughter. In most cases though he'll make up fake stories just to have a reason to rip nagasumi to shreds with his bare hands. San's mother is the opposite and is the only thing that shield's nagasumi from certain death. We also have a few serfs, giant octopuses, hungry sharks and so on but they're only there to provide more comedy. Plot-wise, they're insignificant. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then of course we have various rivals & supporting characters. The charming teenage commander of a submarine (I know wtf?) - Mikawa Kai. We have a guy named Sarutobi, who in most cases will make NO sense whatsoever and will always attempt to look epic. The unnoticed class president who yearns for attention. We have Mawari, daughter of the chief of police and the keeper of peace and order but she unintentionally causes most of the chaos in Nagasumi's school. And we have Akeno Shiranui, an uptight and hostile knight-in-training who does everything by the book. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the fact that this series is focused mostly on comedy the plot will progress and the character development is strong. Both main characters, Nagasumi and San, will go through plenty of situations that will test their love for each other.What also suprised me was the mixing of seriousness, drama and comedy. A single double entedre scene might cause a full scale conflict between the characters which will be presented in a serious but hilarious way. And that might further escalate into something even more hilarious and completely off topic to what originally happened until you're not sure what kind of anime you're watching anymore. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are fantastic. The opening was already funny in its own way and the ironic thing about it is that it is a nutshell description of the events that will eventually unfold throughout the series. Wackiness and romance packed up together to produce something so random that even I couldn't keep up. As for the art, well, it just has to be seen. The style itself literally changes in every scene. Depending on whether it's a serious, funny or dramatic one. Random stuff will pop up at the most unexpected moments. The apperances of characters will suddenly change like Nagasumi becoming muscular and massive out of the blue, a bit like Goku from DBZ or Sarutobi changing into either a monkey or an old man with a beard. It's just wtf moments all the time and that's what this series aims for. It parodies not only other animes/movies but also itself. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is the strongest part of this anime because you will laugh yourself to death. Inappropriate, crazy... unpredictable. That's what 'Seto no Hanayome' is. It simply has to be seen. A review, any single review, will not truly describe this anime.   \\n\\n\r\nA phenomenal series and it will be going into my favourites.\\n\\n",

It's listed as a romantic comedy but there is absolutely nothing for romance fans here, so if that's what you are looking for, you will be disappointed. However, on the same note, I have to say that this is one of the funniest series you will find out there.\r\nOff the wall antics and great voice acting lead to 26 episodes filled with laughs, including one particular episode about a boil on the ass that will have you in stitches. Also, on a side note, the opening theme is extremely catchy.I still have the tune stuck in my head, even though I know very little Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nThe story can get a little tedious at times and a few of the characters can get tedious and annoying. However, I think I got annoyed with them because when I first started the series, I thought it was a romantic comedy and a few of the characters were always getting in the way of the two main characters getting lovey-dovey in any way. When I realized the makers of the anime never actually intended for romance to come into the picture, those annoyances went away and I was able to enjoy the show more.\\n\\n\r\nSeto no Hanayome is definitely a first-rate anime, enjoyable from start to finish and as long as the perceived notion that this is a romance is not relevent, anyone can enjoy this.",

            "content": "This anime will have you laughing hysterically. Seto no Hanayome is so far the funniest anime I have ever seen.\r\nThe story of Seto no Hanayome begins with Nagasumi going on a trip to his grandmothers house. While there he drowns and is saved by a mermaid. The mermaid later appears on land and asks him to marry her. Later it turns out that the girls family is part of the Yakuza and by mermaid law if a mermaid saves a human that said mermaid has to die. However, there is a loophole that if Nagasumi marries Sun then she would not have to die becauseNagasumi is technically part of her family. So he proposes to Sun and the rest of the anime is just a series of running gags that will always make you laugh.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is great. Todd Haberkorn and Alexis Tipton are hilarious together in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I like most about this show is its use of running gags like for example Shark Fujishiro always attempt to eat Nagasumi and Lunar's weird laugh that makes her eyes go in the opposite direction.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character in this entire show is Sun's father he is just frickin' funny the way he acts all tough, but when it comes to Sun he acts all cute and lovable towards his daughter.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character's Nagasumi and Sun Seto have a great relationship and they are a great couple. There's also Lunar Edomae who is Sun's childhood friend who has this friendly rivalry that gets way out of control in this anime. Then there are the other characters that deserve mentioning like Chimp, Masa, Maki, Ren, Gozaburo, and Akeno.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime is its comedy and running gags. Oh, and I forgot to mention Lunar's father who is basically a terminator rip-off and has some of the funniest scenes in this show. Overall Seto no Hanayome is a show that will have you laughing over and over again in every episode and is definitely worth watching.",

I can't tell you how many times i laughed out loud while watching this...\r\nThe focus of this anime is to make you laugh... it takes a leap into the fantasy elements, and because of this, its somewhat unrealistic, but insanely funny. The character's are unique, and consistent. It is defiantly a romantic comedy... with very much focus on the comedy.\r\nI can't rate this anime according to Story, Art, etc...the entire focus was on the humor... the art, music, humor,sound effects etc.\r\nThey were all build around making people laugh. I could say the story had a 9... or the art wasa little funky at times, but it wouldn't matter...\\n\r\nThe humor gets a 10... thus it accomplished its goal of being funny... and things like art, and character development become less of an issue.\\n\\n\r\nI give it one score:\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10\\n\\n\r\nIt was a great and funny fantasy.Well worth the time to watch.",

One day during his summer vacation, Nagasumi was saved from drowning by a mermaid, San Setouichi, in the Seto Inland Sea. However, under mermaid law, if a mermaid's identity as a mermaid has been revealed, both the mermaid who was involved and the human who saw the mermaid are to be executed. In an attempt to save both Nagasumi and San's lives, San's family, which is apparently the head of its own mob, reluctantly decides that the two are to bemarried.\\n\r\nG&amp;#333;zabur&amp;#333;, San's father, however, is enraged about his daughter running off and getting married, especially to a human whom he deems inferior. Between G&amp;#333;zabur&amp;#333;'s attempts on his life and the madcap antics of a whole slew of antagonists &mdash; including the daughter of a rival mobster and a rich male transfer student with an attraction for San &mdash; Nagasumi is not enjoying a very smooth transition into his new lifestyle.\\n\r\n(From Wikipedia)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Opinion\\n\r\nOkay so I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out... I mean it's an anime about mermaids.  Well, it ended up being one of the funniest shows that i've seen thus far.\\n\r\nSo.... what was unique about Seto? Well, for one... it had yakuza mermaids... therby shattering any previous notions that all mermaids are angelic. The next thing is the characters. If Gozaburo failed to get laughs, there were always his faithful flunkeys. And if that wasn't enough... ep 11 introduces us to a new character who is a direct parody of the Terminator.\\n\r\nThe biggest plus is the animation style and the voice actors.  A few things that will guarantee to get laughs every time... whenever san looks dumbfounded and speaks... San's mermaid song of sleep... Runa's mermaid song of battle... and whenever Kai is exposed to sunlight.\\n\r\nIn truth... it's very childish humor intended for older kids.\\n\r\nA really good series through and through...\\n\r\nI demand a second season.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to...\\n\r\n- Hayate no Gotoku\\n\r\nSimilar parody style humour... except Seto actually has a plot.\\n\\n\r\n- Zero no Tsukaima\\n\r\nHuman being dragged into an outside world of differing laws.

            "content": "Are you tired of watching those \"epic\" and long animes? Tired of big and detailed stories? Believe me, everyone gets tired of it once in a while.\r\nIf you are, watch this. It's not possible that you won't laugh at all.\r\n> STORY:\r\nEven if not an important part of the anime, it's pretty interesting (but it's a very common theme among this kind of anime). \r\nIt starts as Nagasumi Michishio is on vacation at his granny's beach house with his parents. He is swimming when a BIG wave throws him to the seafloor and (just like any other mermaid animes), he is rescued by a mermaid calledSeto San. The problem is, San's family follows the mermaid rule of having to kill any human that sees them, plus her father is a kick-ass chef of a mermaid mafia (awesome). In order not to kill Nagasumi, San decides to marry him, and they do so. After some time on the beach house (5 or 6 episodes), they go the the city as school is about to restart. The rest of the anime presents many new characters slowly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't the main thing, but it is always happening, and you can fell it even when surrounded by nonsense jokes, and it IS a romantic anime, but not a deep one. Unfortunately, as the anime goes on, jokes go over the top and make your head go fuzzy about the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n> ART:\\n\r\nSquared eyes and colourful hairstyles make the characters rather unique and fun, being extremely fitting for the so-happy anime, plus there are very detailed backgrounds at all times, and combined, they make this anime's visuals work just right. Something fancy and noticable at any episode is someone showing a scary (but funny as hell) angry face, normally San's father, and as a reaction, a scary (and one of a kind) perplexed face from Nagasumi. I just can't keep a straight face at those.\\n\r\nIt's nothing amazingly beautiful, though.\\n\\n\\n\r\n> SOUND:\\n\r\nNice soundtrack and perfect voice acting. The voice actors were made for the characters, and make you laught even more when changing their original voices to something absolutely unexpected (for example, when San sings the la-le-loo song).\\n\\n\\n\r\n> CHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThey are ALL hilarious, with no exceptions.\\n\r\nTheir personalities lack a bit, but man, with the jokes I just can't rate this badly. Actually, the jokes make up for every fail aspect of this anime, and that's why it gets a 10 from me.\\n\\n\\n\r\n> ENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nNo anime can make me laugh as hard as I have while watching Seto no Hanayome, and I believe you will fell the same. It's just too funny.\\n\r\nThe story is also fancy.\\n\\n\\n\r\n> OVERALL:\\n\r\nFUNNY AS HELL.\\n\r\nIf you get tired of watching, stop and continue the other day, since the story is taken by jokes in the second half of the anime, but don't stop, you WON'T find anything like this. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoy it, and make sure you don't pee on you pants! ^^",

Although this anime classic, I will not judge this anime. Precisely, this anime is very good to watch the view of the genre is already interesting that is Rom-Com or called Romantic Comedy.\r\n\u201cMy Bride is a Mermaid,\u201d tell about a boy named Michisio Nagasumi (Takahiro Mizushima) who was visiting his grandmother who lived in Seto\u2019s hinterland with her family. One afternoon when Nagasumi swam in the sea, he suddenly fell asleep because hewas too frightened. At the same time, suddenly he is helped by a very beautiful mermaid named Seto Sun (Haruko Momoi) or commonly called San. In the afternoon, San visits Nagasumi\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house and says that Nagasumi should be responsible for the incident this afternoon.\\n\\n\r\nNagasumi and his parents were invited to the Seto Clan\u2019s residence at the bottom of Seto Bay. Nagasumi is informed that in the mermaid rule, every mermaid whose identity has been exposed by humans must both be executed. San\u2019s father (Kenta Miyake) who is a leader of the Seto Clan did not want it to happen to his beloved son. He originally wanted to kill nagasumi but was blocked by his mother. His mother is Seto Ren (Makiko Nabei) who suggested a solution to the problem that is married. Nagasumi initially refused because he was the feeling people should not be forced especially if not yet know each other. But after seeing the spirit of San, he also received an offer from her mother.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMy Bride is a Mermaid\u201d is an anime you should watch because every episode will make you laugh like anime Nichijou, Baka & Test, or The Devil is a Part-Time!. This anime will make you laugh out loud. The art problem does not have to be asked because maybe some of you will think the picture is bad, ugly, and make sore eyes. In my opinion, the picture is very good considering this anime is a classic anime of 2007. Like any other school genre anime, this anime is a daily life Nagasumi and his friends and San.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, from the beginning I can already guess the ending. But, I will never underestimate what happened to him because of Epic Fight. Gonzo is the studio that works on this anime besides Welcome to the NHK, Rosario + Vampire, Hellsing, and others.",

            "content": "Seto no Hanayome can be described as a random slapstick comedy. At points none of it make any sense at all. If you are looking for comedy with a plot this is NOT your cup of tea. But if you just want mindless laughs this one can be pretty fun.\r\nFirst to the bad points:\r\nThere is no plot...none. They make up a setting for Nagasumi to meet and engage San. Nagasumi, to save the woman who had just saved his live, accepts to marry her....that's all the plot you are going to get. After that is just one crazy situation after the other just to testtheir resolve to stay together. 99% of those situations make no sense at all.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple of annoying characters that I could go without. The (little) assassin Maki is the most annoying character on the anime. It's just the same jokes over and over, the same reactions. Always trying to break the couple apart. (Honestly why the hell San-chan is even friends with someone who tries to kill her fianc\u00e9 every freaking episode, WTF???). At least they toned her down a bit on the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs a lot of slapstick comedies do, they resort to introducing new characters everytime they fill the same jokes are getting old. I find this a fault and it shows a lack of creativity. They could just create new situations, make the character evolve...but why bother? Just throw in some weird looking new guy or a new hot Tsundere and that's that...(I think this is just lazy comedy).\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing, I know is something pointless to wish for in this sort of anime, but I really would like to watch their relationship really grow, they becoming more like of a real couple...even if it was just a kiss.\\n\\n\r\n The good points:\\n\\n\r\nThe lead man, Nagasumi-kun, is subject to a lot of pain and misunderstandings while trying to win the heart of his lady. However, to be fair, if any character had a personality growth in this anime it was Nagasumi. He starts as the guy that gets punched, shoot at, slaped, etc., etc. (as always on this kind of comedy). But throughout the anime he goes from the butt of almost every single joke to a guy that really charm his way into the girls hearts. He says that he wants to be someone who San-chan can love, and you actually see him, little by little, becoming more self assured and confident (Although remember this is a comedy so he still is the butt of a lot of jokes).\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the female lead goes San is a more interesting leading female than a lot of other on this type of anime. She actually shows her feelings for her guy, she fights for him, all of these made her earn a LOT of points with me. Overall she is a strong female, who DOES show her love. Plus, at points she was really funny, which is refreshing since most of anime girls just blush and behave like 5 year olds.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Mikawa Kai and Saru, two of the supporting characters, are freaking hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was fine, It guaranteed some really good laughs. If you are bored and just want to laugh, give it a try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Seto no Hanayome is a story about Nagasumi who was forced to marry Seto San after discovering that she was a mermaid. According to the mermaid law, if any human saw a mermaid in their 'mermaid form',  the mermaid has to be killed or they have to get married. even by reading you know that it's comedy, it's hardcore comedy to the core ==. \r\nStory:8/10\r\n                 For its genre, i'd say Seto no hanayomeis one of the best. The story isn't complex and most of the episodes are just for comedic purpose so few were involved in the actual plot. all this doesn't matter because the comedy will leave you laughing and wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\n                 even though it's hardcore comedy, we still get to see the growth of the relationships between the characters. Most of the female characters shows interest in Nagasumi but not to the extent where i would call this a romance anime. The only real romance only goes around between San and Nagasumi. \\n\\n\r\n                  I liked how in Seto no Hanayome how episode 12/13 is a major part of the story. It makes you feel like this anime is seperated to two parts because after this they introduce a new character(Shiranui) plays an important role towards the story and ending.\\n\\n\r\n                    episode 12/13 will end with San saving Nagasumi and in the end(episode 25/26), Nagasumi returns the favour by saving San from a perverted fish. these parts of the anime is just awesome, especially the ending. When you read the manga, you'll see that the anime ending doesn't really happen but the ending really feels like a movie, awesome music + action and there's still comedy even  in the serious moments of battle.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\n                    The art is very sharp and cute, gives you the impression of a comedy anime\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\n                     the op was funny to begin with. Jokes were made funnier with the sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n                      Nagasumi isn't that special. He's the type of protagonist is forced to accept everything and life. Nagasumi doesn't make most of the comedy, he's more of a medium to channel the comedy. however, you'll get to see him rock in the end.\\n\\n\r\n                      San's the cute heroine of the story, from appearance to her voice, everything about San is perfect.She resembles the type of good wife any guy would want.     \\n\\n\r\n                        most of the supporting characters are just damn funny specifically - Edomae, Hideyoshi and the fish trio. you have to watch for yourselves to experience the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10.\\n\r\n                       Being a purely comedy anime, I think Seto no Hanayome is the best from all the animes i have watched. every episode was funny and the ending was satisfying. I just can't ask for more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnime Vs. manga:\\n\r\n                       The disappointing part is the manga. When I found out Seto no hanayome's manga is still ongoing, I almost jumped in excitement. First page, and I already lost interest, the art is just too simple. that's not the only bad part, all the new characters in the manga which are not shown in the anime are female and........ lesbians. They seem to show interest only towards San and will do anything to get close to her like a yandere character would. Because of all this, i stick with the anime and stopped reading the manga.\\n\r\nHave fun watching! :)\\n",

Here is why you should watch this anime:\r\n1. The English voice actors are simply brilliant, especially the main character Nagasumi's. It's the same guy who voices Watanuki in xxxHOLIC and I love his voice. (I love Watanuki, too.)\r\n2. The characters are full of energy until the end, so it's never boring. Especially Nagasumi - something always happens to him. There is good character development at least for the two main characters. Others just hangaround.\\n\\n\r\n3. The dialog was good, new, and fresh. Not your everyday dirty words (but you can learn all the new ones).\\n\\n\r\n4. The story was great, the start of the story is different and fresh makes you curious to watch more (just like Ouran Host Club).\\n\\n\r\n5. The situation - the problems the characters face are very unique to the story so it's not all BLA BLA BLA like in other romantic comedies. The plot is actually interesting to watch (thank God). I enjoyed it a 100%, it became one of the best comedies ever in my list (along with Ouran).",

            "content": "Thanks to a recommendation from my friend, I marathoned what I believe to be the funniest comedy-anime I've seen! \r\nFor fans of Funimation or simply those looking for a good laugh, I would highly recommend this anime. 26 episodes, and I am already hoping for a second season! The summary says it all: Teen boy gets unexpectedly engaged to a cute mermaid and it's all humor and hijinks from there!\r\nWhere do I begin? For the most part, I can only say that you have to see the anime for yourself to sort of see why it's so hilarious, because if I tried to explain allthese scenarios and misconceptions and misunderstandings and awkward encounters...well, you get the idea. As for everything else, I became really attached to these characters and the way the story flowed. (Almost with scenarios like that of which you'd see on a sitcom) One of my favorite things about this anime is the two main characters, the main relationship: Nagasumi and Sun. I almost feel so sorry for Nagasumi, this character never catches a break. Every episode, it's either someone's pointing a weapon at him, or he's become the center of a huge misunderstanding or he has a near-death experience, and it's really all for nothing, because this character is not bad in any way, he has no evil or dark intentions, he's really just trying to make his future wife feel at home and happy on land, and no one really sees that. And Sun, she's a fun character to see in action, she has a really deep-spirited attitude towards her home of the seas, but on land, she's kind of an airhead, considering the ways of the humans that she's not entirely used too. By the end of the show, it's quite surprising how much development these two go through for just a comedy! The supporting characters for the most part, are a ton of fun, these are really likable characters, especially in the school setting that appears in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick a leading factor in this anime's humor, it's the animation. To be more specific, the faces. Any time something goes wrong, or there's a huge misunderstanding right down to a sex-innuendo, the faces and reactions of these characters are downright hysterically laugh-till-you-can't-breathe-FUNNY! And since it's an anime, it pays off even more! It might be just that I have that wacky sense of humor, but from most of the reviews I've read, people share the same thoughts as I do with this show's humor and I don't blame them. Like everyone else, I strongly feel there's much more this anime can explore and show, and while it is very unlikely, I would love to see a second season, but to be honest, I'm perfectly fine too with the way this anime ended at episode 26. It leaves you with a couple questions but also lets you fill the voids for yourself. Overall, I really enjoyed this anime, defiantly recommend it to people into the humor-genre of anime. \\n",

I didn't like all characters as much but most of them are a great addition to the cast.\r\nThe animation is good as well, switching style and background at just the right moment. One minor remark is the blood which is strangely rainbow colored. It makes it more noticeable but I hadto think twice before I realized it was blood.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to watch this for a while now but I decided to watch it with a friend and it was worth sharing the experience.

Coupled with numerous surprise jokes, an interesting plot, hilarious running gags, and an interesting cast of characters, this show has potential to win almost any comedy show viewer. \r\nTo top it off, unlike other 12 to 26 episode animes with blandfinales (or lack of finales altogether), this anime has an amazing finale that truly tied the show together for a more-than-satisfying finale (especially for a show of this genre). In my humble opinion, the finale took an already 9/10 show and turned it into a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review on this site, but in order to give you a little background info about me: I've seen quite a few comedy-oriented anime on top of all the other animes that are generally seen. I've been watching anime since I was 4 or 5, so I can safely say I've seen A LOT. \\n\\n\r\nKeeping that in mind, there's no doubt in my mind that My Bride is a Mermaid was one of the greatest, most funniest anime I have ever seen. I found it to be really similar to my other all time favorite comedy anime Baka and Test. So if you loved shows like Baka and Test, Ouran High School Host Club, Angel Beats, World God Only Knows, The Devil is a Part-Timer, etc then you'll definitely love My Bride is a Mermaid.\\n\\n\r\nHappy viewing! ^_^",

Those anime make up a large portion of the comedy anime that are available out in the world, which leaves only a small percentage that is consider real comedy. Seto no Hanayome is one of those anime, part of the 1% population, that will make you laugh and continue to laugh for quite a few more minutes. \r\nThe plot is simple, straight-forward thus itis easy to understand, but do not let that fool you. The plot may be simple, but is decorated with many comical moments that pose more benefits than harm. In a sense, the comedy is truly something to laugh about because the jokes and references are meaningful thus there is always something that back up the joke. I might not be an expert when it comes to making joke, but if you make a joke out of the blue and it has no connection to the context whatsoever then it might not turn out to be a joke the audience would laugh at. Seto no Hanayome  does that in a way that it is hilarious and flows with the story which as I mentioned earlier is straight-forward thus giving the anime an edge. The simple plot makes it easy to insert comical scenes here and there, so the plot works with the anime rather than against it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art I must add, is not the best nor is it the worst I have seen. It is average in terms of graphic; the fight scenes are decent. The looks of the characters overall are not that bad, but it is definitely an improvement from the art in the manga. On the other hand, when it comes to OP and ED the anime have captivating and heart warming songs which match the anime comical atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe entertainment of the anime is amazing that someone should \"raise the roof\" literally.The simple story-line combined with many good comedy the anime will keep you on the edge of your edge and there won't be one second for you not to laugh. There no cliffhangers, no suspense, no captivating things that will make you come back for more, but what the anime does have is comedy. The comedy make us want more because, who doesn't want to laugh? The anime takes something as simple as comedy and make it larger thus taking full advantage of it which is fairly noticeable in other anime.\\n\\n\r\n It is splendid anime and is geared toward anime fan who enjoy comedy, plain and simple.",

            "content": "Seto no Hanayome is by far one of the best rom-coms I have ever seen. Although my horizons in the rom-com genre are quite narrow, the previous statement is still saying alot. As a person who loves to laugh but rarely does due to lack of comedic material, I found SnH quite amusing. This is an anime that took the harem and rom-com genre and made It into something original and genuinely funny. \r\nPlot\r\nUnfortunately, the plot was the one aspect of this series that was generic. It was a forced marriage conflict and how the people react and develop from it. Every episode, save thelast one, had little to no drama or impact but they were amusing nonetheless. This series lacks a deep plot, but I never expected one anyway. However, I was quite satisfied with the ending. The ending wrapped up everything into a neat package, which most harem/rom-com animes do not. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters were by far the most enjoyable part of the series. There were some character archtypes such as the tsundere, but most of the cast was very well-developed and  unique. The two main characters, San and Nagasumi, had some very interesting chemistry. Their relationship was very predictable at first, but it turned into something that I could appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI have to mention that this series uses ALOT of exaggerated expressions and random \"chivalry\" scenes. You'll know what I mean by the first episode. Art-wise, this series delivers relatively well. The drawings were very clean and detailed and the animation had no flaws as far as I could see.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack\\n\r\nThe opening was catchy and pleasant at first, but then it got irritating after the 10th playthrough. Same with the ending theme. The BGM was rather nice, but then I realized they only used like 8 songs throughout the whole series. It got a bit redundant but the hilarious scenes deviated my attention slightly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Who Should Watch it\\n\r\nSnH is a true gem in the rom-com genre. It actually makes you laugh while retaining a good romantic plot and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, it's not groundbreaking nor is it a comedic masterpiece, but it was damn funny at the least. Anyone with a decent sense of humor can appreciate this show. Go check it out for a couple dozen laughs.",

            "content": "Seto no Hanayome- This review came kinda late, but I'm writing this for one of my most favorite anime of all time. At first I wasn't a big fan of romance/comedy type anime, but after watching this, It made me into one. This is possibly the best romance/comedy anime I ever watched.\r\nSeto no Hanayome seems like your normal romance/comedy anime, but this anime was very hilarious. Yup, Hilarious to the EXTREME. Now moving on to my review.......\r\nStory- Story is about a boy named Michishio Nagasumi who is saved by a mermaid(whoa! Pretty Rare), who was actually drowning in the middle of the sea...How did heeven get there? Even I don't know. Well~ I will just explain until there..You can get more info in this website anyways. Now, the story is great at start but when it progresses, it starts going nowhere. Many episodes were pretty random but very hilarious. The ending? It was awesome. Story sometimes a bit dull but you'll pretty soon ignore the story once you like the hilariousness. Story= 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Animation was great BUT didn't always stay that way. There were few \"graphical anomalies\". Sometimes, characters look different than usual. They sometimes look kind of funny and weird. That's a flaw which I find, quite annoying. But graphics still are mostly great. Art= 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Sound? OP and ED are both very awesome. I loved both of OP and ED and its extremely catchy. Especially, the 2nd ED, which is VERY cute. Voice-acting was absolutely great. No, I'm not being sarcastic. Its true. Sound= 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Many characters have very wacky attitudes and always acted so strangely which makes it extremely hilarious. Character designs are great~ . Character= 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- All the enjoyment comes from the wackiness and how hilarious this anime is. This anime is probably the most funniest anime I ever watched, and personally, even funnier than School Rumble. Hilariousness remains over-the-top in each single episode and maybe each single minute. Many episodes were pretty pointless which is why the anime doesn't focus on its story much. The anime isn't even serious most of the time. But still its very funny. The jokes doesn't get old too. Is is re watchable? Yes and  Very high indeed. Enjoyment= 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Seto no hanayome is recommended for everyone to watch. Whether you hate romance type anime, this anime could make you into a fan of romance! \\n\r\nBut if you want more serious romance, go watch any of the EF series. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go watch Seto no Hanayome again...for the 22nd time.\\n\r\nOVERALL= 10 out of 10...actually it should be a 1000 out of 10.",

At moments it is really funny but the array of annoying characters (San's Dad,Little Assasin Girl, Luna) it feels like the whole time its just shouting and that is really annoying me why dont they just talk??? especially the first 2 episodes :(, myears felt numb after the amount of shouting San's Dad did it just to annoying at the moment to be good the expression i can deal with (Thanks to Lovely Complex), but to me they need to stop the shouting and stuff then it will be good, at the moment i would say its quite enjoyable only due to the few funny moments. \\n\r\nAt the moment its just giving me a headache lol and with the stupid plots like epsode 9 about the guy on a submarine it's just bit Fan Service, dont get me wrong i love the relationship betwen the 2 main characters and story and stuff but they need to carm down and speak normally otherwise its hard to concentrate on the anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory- Unique (Mermaids) with the good mix with Yazuka but its a little too random and a bit jumpy\\n\\n\r\nArt- one of the worst ive seen too many expressions and changes the charatcer looks into blobs of white etc.. is quite poor\\n\\n\r\nSound- not too many song i can think of but they have been ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The main ones are cool especially San Chan but i hate how annoying atleast 3 of them are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- its quite funny and thats only why i gave it a 8 but i would hope for the shouting all the time to stop so it will be barable to watch",

            "content": "Never have I laughed so hard at such simple jokes and parodies! They execute these in such a manner that it feels almost natural! Even the individual characters themselves are commonplace in most animes, but in my opinion, they are used well and properly! Their not just random characters slapped into the story for one episode, almost every character you see you will see at least three more times! The OVA's ,however, introduce a new character, but with lack of support of who she is, which leaves a opening for this character to show up in the nonexistent next season.\r\nThe anime begins with a unluckyguy named Nagasumi Michishio, who one day while at the beach, he is drowning for some apparent reason (there is no explanation to why he got into that situation) and is saved by a mermaid. Later, after waking up on the beach, he goes back to his grandma's house and tells his parents, who in return think he was seeing things, but later that night, a group of Yakuza looking men show up with the mermaid girl between them. He is shocked when they take him, his mother, and father to the sea, thinking they will dump them in the sea, but instead they jump with them, and bring them to an underwater dojo of some sort. He finds out that the name of the mermaid girl that saved him is Sun Seto, who is the daughter of the mermaid Seto Yakuza Family. Under mermaid law the person who saw, or the mermaid who revealed themselves, must be executed, but instead they are to be married. The father however, dislikes this whole plan, and continuing through the series, he attempts to  assassinate, eliminate, kill, terminate, murder, or mutilate Nagsumi in anyway possible\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses he gains abilities such as the ability to avoid anything thrown at him, and with the help of Sun, take down crazy fanboys,  henchmen, and other people who disturb his not so normal lifestyle. Another character comes to rival Sun, the daughter of their rival family, Lunar Edomae, who is a pop idol in Japan, she joins the series somewhere between the 6 or 7, 7 being a war over most popular girl in the school Sun Vs. Lunar!\\n\\n\r\nMy final comment on this anime is that the story is set, the art is awesome, the sound is always good, the characters are likable or dis-likable in a good way. My overall rating would be a 9.5/10",

I kept thinking, but I just kept scrolling and found other animes that interested me. So I had kind of forgot about ever thinking about watching this anime. Then, one day, as I'm watching an episode of an anime under the \"Recommended for You\" was \"My Bride is a Mermaid.\"  Well now that I couldn't get this thing out of my head, I just decided to give it a try. And Iam so glad I did give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nMy Bride is a Mermaid is one of the funniest and most original animes I've ever watched and I couldn't stop watching it! Since the first episode I had been hooked on it. It sounds like a simple romance anime about a boy who meets a girl and his world is changed forever, but it is nothing like that. One day, Nagasumi Michishio is out in the middle of the ocean, drowning, and no one can hear him...except the Seto meramid Sun Seto who saves Nagasumi from drowning.  \\n\\n\r\nI could give a summary all about this anime but you guys should just watch it and see how awesome and wonderfully funny this anime really is. The artwork style is adorable, and the theme song ties the whole anime together. It's really worth watching :D",

Sometimes they can affect my grade if they're extraordinary but most of the time I give a grade based on my enjoyment through characters, development and story as it happened for this show.\r\nParody is not a genre I like very much and watch often that's why the somehat low grade. In all fairness it is one of the better parody anime I've ever watched so you should give it atry if you like this genre and most probably you wouldn't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a kid who had to marry a mermaid from a mafia clan. Mermaid comes to his home and lives with him and goes to the same school. Since they can't tell anyone that they are supposed to be married and because it is a harem anime, girls in the show one by one falls in love with him as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before I don't like parody genre and there were couple of times when I almost dropped this anime however due to its good rating I tried to finish it and I'm glad that I did because I don't know if I get used to the comedy of the show or if it was the plot but after 20th episode it really picked up. Especially 20th episode is one of the funniest anime episodes I've ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nThere is almost no character development but it is a comedy show and all of the characters' roles are pretty set at the start and it works. One thing I don't like is how they got to the ending. It feels really rushed. At the last 2 episodes all of a sudden lead character changes and that change start the ending story.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing. I'm gonna try to be as vague as I can be to not give away spoilers but if you like to know how they conclude the harem aspect of an anime, like me, then this might interest you. When this show is finished nothing had set in stone but I think it is one of better one on that aspect.",

Although most of the parodying goes straight over my head it still manages to make me laugh.\r\nThe story is basically about a middle high school boy called Nagasumi on holiday with his parents in Seto Island gets into trouble while swimming in the sea and begins to drown. However, he issaved my a mermaid called Seto san. Normally this would be a good thing but Seto San is the daughter of the head of Seto Island Yakuza and now he knows that mermaids exist he a) must be killed b) Seto San must be killed or c) Seto San and Nagasumi must marry. Obviously he chooses option c).\\n\\n\r\nNegasumi assumes this is a marriage of convenience but Seto San takes it very seriously and moves in and goes to school with Nagasumi on the condition that the fact she is a mermaid is kept a secret. Unfortunately for Nagasumi this is when his problems begin.\\n\\n\r\nNow this where you would expect Seto no Hanayome to go down the usual romantic comedy route where Seto San is constantly splashed by water and Nagasumi desperately tries to cover it up with hilarious results. Which it does and then some.\\n\\n\r\nSeto San's father becomes their homeroom teacher and wants to beat Nagasumi to a pulp, Seto San's mum is the school nurse and Seto San is joined by Maki a shellfish assassin whose goal it is to kill Nagasumi while looking innocent in front of Seto San.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets worse for Nagasumi. His favourite pop idol moves in his house where it turns out she is the daughter of the head of the rival yakuza clan to the Seto clan, her cute public personality masks an evil side and treats Nagasumi as a servent, a member of the Seto Clan is really a shark who wants to eat him and the rich son of another yakuza clan is a love rival and arrives in the most bizarre places in a submarine.\\n\\n\r\nTo say Nagasumi's life becomes complicated is an understatement.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty average but the story, characters and sound more than make up for it.\\n\\n\r\nDon't worry in trying to understand what is going on 100% of the time just sit back and enjoy the ride.",

            "content": "This review is for the original Japanese version of \"Seto no Hanayome\", not the english dubbed version by Funimation:\r\n\"Seto no Hanayome\" is a Romantic Comedy anime that doesn't so much focus on the romance aspect to get you through the story as much as it's comedy. The anime starts you off with a rom/com feel, but it quickly digresses into comedy that overwhelms the romance aspect. There are still your typical romantic moments here and there between Nagasumi and Sun, as well as Lunar and co. I would've wished to see more romance in the series but the humor in the show was funny enoughso that I didn't mind. A good portion of the humor in this anime was parody based. For example, Lunar's father is parodied after \"the Terminator\" which leads to utter hilarity in the moments when he is present. One thing I loved about this anime was its Music. Most of (if not all) the vocal music in this anime is done by the seiyuus of Sun and Lunar. The songs range from funny, to catchy, to awesome in this series. My personal favorite in the series is the opening \"Romantic Summer\" by both Sun & Lunar. All in all, a really funny anime with some nice romantic moments in between all the chaos. Highly recommended!",

I am very glad i didn't cause this has turned into one of the funniest anime iv'e seen.\r\nIt is hard to even be able to make a guess as to what the next episode will entail. This is one of the best parts it can either involve sending a Titan obsessed with his porn to the moon or it can involve ass acne. There are some jokes that get old after the first 15 times. But they do start to get better onhow to pace the jokes later on.\\n\\n\r\nFor me after i got past the first couple episodes this was an amazing show. The first few episodes are filled with as mentioned above use of the same joke ( Facial animation, Being attracted to a black dude with an afro) and also annoying characters. One of witch is actually a good character after a certain point in the show. But you do have to deal with the MC's parents who are awful ( Mostly the Mother) \\n\\n\r\nThe main female star ( Seto ) Is in all honestly the best part for me. She makes jokes at the right time and she is also adorable all through out the season.\\n\\n\r\nWould suggest to watch this if it sounds like your cup of tea.",

Until the part where the protagonist was save from drowning. From that onwards. It really absorbed me into the protagonist's situations throughout the anime. Imagine what will you do if some girl asked to be your wife out of the blue when you are on a school vacation with your parents around? Too good to be true huh? \r\nBut this does bother me though. Having a mermaid as a wife. Duh what am i saying!\r\nAlright. The story is somehow overallreasonabily entertaining and amusing. But I don't really find the ending of this anime satisfying, since it ends too brief and sudden. \\n\\n\r\nThis story deals more to a relationship between husband and wife. Showing how important trust is between one another. Love is all about trust. And it applies to everything else everytime, everywhere. \\n\r\nBesides have you ever come across something you did wrong and would want to aplogize to someone you've crossed and the word wouldnt come out of your mouth? This happens all the time but all you have to do is to just apologize! \\n\\n\r\nNow the art wrok is just nice. Opening theme is no doubt one of my favourite. The background music is great. However! The ending really pisses me off. They should at least extend the ending and make it more like a happily ever after ending rather than this! (whatever..) Too bad for me i really like happy endings(though its a happy one, i am somehow still unstatisfied).\\n\\n\r\nNow finally, would you consider yourself lucky if you were caught in an odd situation like this and getting married to a mermaid yourself?",

            "content": "This is one of my favourite animes of all time. Now, I'm not naive. This isn't a must watch show like Bebop or GitS and I know romantic comedies/harem shows aren't for everyone. But if you give it a chance you'll be more than pleasantly surprised.\r\nThe story begins with Nagasumi, a seemingly average Japanese high schooler, drowning in the ocean. He's saved by a mermaid, Sun, but unfortunately for both of them the merfolk have very strong laws against being seen by humans. Complicating the matter is that Sun is the only daughter of the leader of a Yakuza group, meaning these laws can't justbe overlooked. And what is the punishment for breaking these laws? Death, for either the human or the mermaid. Luckily there's a 3rd option that you can guess from the anime's title; marriage. If Sun and Nagasumi are married, they'll be family and the laws won't apply. And so begins their bumpy road to a relationship, as Sun's overprotective father and his Yakuza attempt at every turn to kill Nagasumi, Sun moves in with him, they struggle to adjust to both of their respective worlds and Nagasumi desperately tries to keep Sun's secret a secret from others like his odd \"friend\" Chimp or his police officer aspiring childhood friend Mawari.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a unique set up for a rather typical romcom storyline. Mermaids don't get much exposure in any kind of media these days so it feels fresh despite using a creature we're all familiar with at this point and they've got some interesting takes on mermaid culture in modern society.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately however it's never the setting that makes a romcom, it's the characters. And this show does a great job with them. Nagasumi is a fairly typical lead, a decent guy that you occasionally feel sorry for considering the stress he has to go through because of his new situation. But he's not perfect; there are times when he's a dick, or lazy, or inconsiderate. Basically he's human and, sadly, that's a breath of fresh air for this genre. If you're tired of seeing the typical white knight that stumbles into \"perverted\" scenarios every episode, then you'll enjoy Nagasumi.\\n\\n\r\nSun, as his opposite, is the true star. As I said above, she's a ditz, maybe even stupid at times, but she's got a heart of gold and legitimately cares about Nagasumi. It's tough not to like her. And...that's really all I need to say about her. She was my favourite character and considering she's a lead, that's great.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a handful of other characters, all fleshed out and feeling like actual people even if some are a little...eccentric. Sun's dad is a bonafide psychopath, but at his heart he just loves his only daughter. Chimp is, well, Chimp and Lunar, despite seeming to be mentally unstable, really just wants to be loved. There's more, but I'll leave it here since most of the fun is in discovering and experiencing these characters for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nIt's at this point too that I want to say I feel this is a harem anime done right. That might be an odd thing to say, since all a harem would need to be \"right\" is a guy and a bunch of girls obsessed with him, but its always too unrealistic for me to suspend my disbelief. The girls are shells, filling one trope or another and existing purely to populate the harem. This isn't the case in My Bride Is A Mermaid. All of the girls, despite having and/or developing feelings for Nagasumi, are characters in their own right. They're not defined by their feelings for Nagasumi and it's an important distinction. You can imagine them existing without him, which isn't the case in other harems like, say, Rosario to Vampire. I hate to keep using this term but it's just a breath of fresh air.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good, if nothing special. It's typical of what you expect of a modern anime without standing out. The music fits, keeping the tone upbeat and generally working to keep in line with the light hearted comedic half of the show. The VAs are at the top of their game as well, with Lunar's VA sounding like she had a bunch of fun with the role.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a must see for romcom fans and I feel you should give it a try even if you're not into the genre. There's few, if any, better examples that you could find.",

I will be making this as if I don't know anything about Japanese ethics, culture, reasoning, and etc. Also I will take facts and information solely gathered from the anime itself. With that in mind, lets get on with the review.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThis anime has a pretty good story that has a an interesting beginning. Our story begins with out main character, Nagasumi Michishio, drowning due to some particular reason not given within the anime. From what I gathered from the anime, a mermaid by the name of Sun Seto rescueshim. After a lot of scenes,the main character is forced to either marry Sun or die due to mermaid law. Of course the anime would be about the marriage route, since it has 24 episodes. As the story progresses, Nagasumi slowly gains new abilities and meets new people, such as his supposed \"rival in love\",Kai Mikawa, and Sun's rival, Lunar Edomae .Many of the episodes contain his misadventures that relate to the mermaid realm of mob and ethics or how they are affecting his life. A common trait constantly pushed through the anime is Chivalry, mostly by Sun herself.The rest is for your pleasure to watch and LOLIHO! LOLIHO! LOLI LOLI LOLIHO!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is from  the early 2000's and is quite good for its time, but there is some haziness or static during some parts of the anime that bothered my eyes, but altogether was pleasant to look at, with bright colors that were light on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nMight as well have been perfect since voicing is spot on, the intro is actually worth a watch, and many of the songs within the anime are quite entertaining\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nBear in mind, many of the characters are not original, but are portrayed so well,  it is forgiven, from tough guys to sissies, this anime has it covered in every way, shape or form. For example, Sun's father, Gozaburo hates Nagasumi, because he does not wish to give away his daughter to anybody (not incestual) and is willing to get rid of Nagasumi through any means necessary. Nagasumi, however does not often return the sentiment and merely tries to avoid his wrath, due to his levelheaded nature and pacifistic tendencies, he often is running from whatever it is that is trying to kill him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThere's not one point in this anime that I didn't find myself laughing at or face palming (in a good way) and I constantly cracked more smiles in a day then I will for the rest of my life\\n\\n\r\nThis anime truly is worth every minute spent, but I will warn you, don't drink or eat during the majority of this anime or you will be choking on it or having it come out your nose!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Out of all the animes I have ever seen, only 2 would receive a perfect score... Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and SETO NO HANAYOME. Both are animes about manliness and both are one of a kind animes that will most likely never be satisfactorily duplicated. I remember laughing so hard tears were coming out of the corner of my eyes during Seto no hanayome.\r\nStory - Great story. It does not follow the story arc format like naruto or full metal alchemist. Instead every episode or every few episodes present their own conflicts. But this is what makes the show so FUNNY. One thing to bewary of is that the humor is extremely fast paced, so if you are not a speed reading champion, you will probably find yourself pausing the anime a few times so you can finish reading the subtitles. But at the same time their rapid talking speed is so hilarious you can't help but laugh.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The animation is extremely high quality. You can see the glare from the sun reflect off their hair. It is very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The music is great! I found myself downloading all of the intro, ending, and character songs once I had completed the anime. The music does an excellent job creating tension and excitement during all the proper moments especially during the finale.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Oh my God! I loved all the characters. None were annoying and they were all different. Nagasumi (the main character) is the funniest anime character you will ever encounter in your life. His variety of facial expressions can only be rivaled by Great Teacher Onizuka.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, let me clarify how amazing this anime is. If God said he would either wipe this anime from existence or kill me, I would choose the latter.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, all of the user recommendations for animes that you might like if you liked Seto no Hanayome are all lies. The top three recomendations, Nagasarete Airantou, To Love-ru, and Hayate the Combat Butler, were three animes that I tried and dropped. I found them to either be monotonous or have an annoying type of ecchi humor.",

Also, it's nice to see something other than high school students; not only that but they keep it believable (girls have their immature and unrealistic ideas about boys and the boys don't know how to correctly express their emotions. You could tell the writers  had fun with the adults and their yakuza characteristics (there's one character thatalways speaks in question mark, they all have accents, the threats really let your imagination go wild, the assassin is perfectly two-faced, not to mention, the \"Daddy's-Little-Girl complexes are to DIE FOR).

Too many people it will be obvious that the show copies a lot of tropes from Urusei Yatsura: forced to marry a girl from a different race, rich rival with a sword, family friends that do not like the protagonist and many others. Trouble is the main character Nagasumi is an embarrassment for a man or a boy.He is the subservient man to women around him and also the show repeats the gag with him being attracted by Masa because Masa did CPR on him a bit too much.These gay vibes from him are annoying and I doubt a woman would be attracted by a man that is so subservient and so effeminate as him. Unlike Ataru who was fun, chased skirts and fought to survive those that try to kill him Nagasumi just acts like a scaredy cat. Also the whole thing with Nagasumi mother almost cucking his father is a bit too much and I find it in poor taste. While Ataru's mother constantly shames him she is not actively trying to cuck him. Shows promoting being effeminate and a cuck are disturbing to say the least.",

That was my favorite part of the show and if you watch it, you'll understand too. this show had me laughing my ass off, and that is something that very few shows can say. Yeah they might make me laugh, but not on such a regular basis such as this.\r\nStory: boy meets girl as boy is drowning to death, girl is a mermaid(surprise) and saves his life, girls dad has his gang kidnap boy and his family because anyone who has seen a mermaid needs to die or that mermaid him/herself, boy and girl decide to get married because somehow thatarrangement prevents their untimely demise.\\n\\n\r\nArt/sound: Art was great. the sound? its sound, its there, that's all it needs to do, end of story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: none of the characters are really all that deep, but since this is comedy we should already know or have guessed that by now. The characters all have their single-minded desires and its just funny because of the complete obviousness of what they are trying to do. In fact, I credit a lot of the humor to this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I spent half of my time doubled-over laughing, of course I enjoyed it, what else am I going to say at this point?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Its one of the better animes that I have seen and I cant believe that I had never heard of this until I randomly stumbled across it like I did. To anyone who's reading this that wants to know whether you should watch it: JUST WATCH IT!",

This is my favourite anime of all time so it will be hard to judge this legitimately. I have also watched twice and i am rewatching it for the third time now.\r\nStory 10: My favourite story ever, the idea of marrying a mermaid is fantastic, not to mention the heaps of benefits that come with it. However there are also some hidrances such as school warfare and many other halarious things.\r\nArt 8: Not the best art, but it was intsantly acceptable. Also it wasn'tforgettable either, it kinda sticks with you. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10: Also had my favourite opening and endings of all time, the backgrounds sounds were also great. None of it is forgettable unlike some other anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10: Great character developement, I enjoyed seeing San and Nagasumi's relationship grow, the other characters side stories were encorperated into the main storyline very well too, none of those random changes and shit. Japanese voice actors were great, english dub wasn't terrible, but i hate dubs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10: I laughed my ass off every episode, from lewd humor to just plain crazy shit, Seto No Hanayome delivers, again and again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10: My Favourite anime, along with Angel Beats and Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou. Make sure you watch in a good quality and be ready for laughs, tears, and your previous favourite to be knocked down.",

            "content": "Seto no Hanayome is a romantic comedy anime that made me smile from start to finish. Each episode utilizes the elements of its mermaid plot and use of the characters personality to execute funny moments. This show focuses more on comedy for like 90% of the time all throughout the series and only 10% on the romantic side.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThere\u2019s a plot yes, but the comedy is what made Seto no Hanayome entertaining. This show tried to develop the story by introducing and involving characters between the main protagonist and the main heroine but no interesting turn to advance the story ever happened. The mini arcfor most of the characters has good pacing and have nice outcomes, but there are noticeable plot holes that will leave you scratch your head if you pay attention. Story is pretty much the achilles heel for this show; the good thing is it is overshadowed by the comedy it gives to the audience. \\n\\n\r\nArt:  7/10\\n\r\nNo character looks the same as the other. The animation is fun to watch as scenery doesn't just stand still. The characters also express silly facial expressions that can make you will burst out laughing. Though I can\u2019t say the animators did an excellent job. The animation is consistent but just as good as any standard quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: 8/10\\n\r\nMusic is the spice for the comedy of this anime. The music director did a good job selecting music for each moment as you can feel the emotion of the characters when they feel sad, rage, hyperactive and when getting serious. No memorable soundtrack but the opening theme is, as I write this review I can still hear the opening song inside my head.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe cast are enjoyable to watch. Each has an interesting personality that contributes for the entertainment of the show. Introduction for some supporting cast will annoy you as they display their role to fullest but they will tone down as episodes gone by. Character development is unnoticeable but it did manage to use the cast well enough to catch your attention. It has a plain protagonist but not dense, airhead heroine but has a humorous personality and supporting cast that tends to be annoying from time to time but still manage to be likable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime started out promising as a romcom anime. I am a bit disappointed by the fact that this show focuses more on comedy than romance. It does manage to have consistent humor because like I said it made me smile from start to finish, even at my least favorite moment. I enjoyed the misunderstanding moments and the characters interactions with one another from complements to insults.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Seto no Hanayome is a fun to watch anime series. It will disappoint you if you are hoping to watch some good romance but it will satisfy you if you are hoping to watch a show that will make you laugh. Story is not a factor, but fun characters and hilarious moments will make up for it.\\n",

            "content": "Overall: mediocre school rom-com whose decent cast and occasional bursts of comedy/parody don't save it from overall drudgery.\r\n_Seto no Hanayome_ stars the generic harem comedy male lead whose main characteristics are mysteriously attracting female attention, remarkable physical endurance, and the devil's own luck. This scenario features him being saved by a mermaid who then has to marry him to prevent him from being executed for knowing about mermaids; subsequently, he 'enjoys' the attention of her unhappy relatives & yakuza loyalists, admirers, and rivals, who all accurately enough observe that she's too good for him, but of course it turns out to be true love anyway.(A time-honored formula going back at least to _Urusei Yatsura_.)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is heavy on cliche. Each character has their shtick and boy do they ever stick to it (don't expect characters like Gozaburo Seto to change through the many episodes; Shark-san will continue to try to eat the lead, the mother will swoon over Masa, etc etc).\\n\\n\r\nWhat rescues SnH from the delete-immediately category is its willingness to take the 'secret mermaid society' conceit and run with it (the mermaids' inborn fear of cats; San's fear of her policewoman classmate Mawari; the Seto Special Squad brothers; the Seto TV shopping channel with tail-enhancing prosthetics; Nakajima constantly being an octopus without it being remarked, and octopus kebabs showing up suspiciously often), and to engage in over the top parodies (the two-episode war between San & Luna loyalists, chockful of _Fist of the North Star_ references & shonen parody; the similar OVA 1; episode 24 where Kai is dying; the Masa mini-episodes slyly mimicking the 'bar scenes' in yakuza/crime dramas, where the game is to guess which character he's talking to before the punchline; Lunar's Papa's _Terminator_ episode and then later allusions; Saru's ero-hermit; episode 19's jidaigeki setting & equation of man-mermaid pairings as a threat to the existing order akin to pro-Imperial revolutionaries in Tokugawa Japan; ep22's depiction of San's ideal delinquent boyfriend). The more 'serious' romantic arc like ep02 and ep25-26 are also good enough to not leave a bad taste.\\n\\n\r\nWhat stops SnH from being better than the watch category is its many wasted opportunities.\\n\r\nFor example, the tail-changing-in-water mechanic might be considered to be the prelude to constant hijinks; as we saw with _Ranma 1/2_, a water-change mechanism can be exploited in countless ways. SnH uses it a few times and forgets it. Or, the first time San does her 'chivalry is spelled the same way as mermaid' shtick, you might infer that this will be ripe for comedy as irrelevant coincidences of kanji lead a headstrong San into considerable silliness. Nope. The yakuza/Mawari angle is weirdly downplayed.\\n\r\nAnd SnH has entire misfiring episodes: episodes 12 & 13 would've been better combined; episode 14 seems a bit thin as a standalone episode (an entire episode on mermaid fear of cats?) and like it would have worked much better as a subplot in another episode; episode 15 is a complete waste, as is episode 21 (both focused on the president character, who should've been mercilessly cut); episode 20 is just uncomfortable and not nearly as funny as the creators apparently think; episode 23 tries to resolve the Masa character but just leaves him in a weird limbo state vis-a-vis his sister which makes one wonder why ep23 even existed when Masa was fine on his own as a 'cool gangster'/mentor character. 26 episodes is a lot of time to work with, but if you want a good comedy, you can't leave so much slack & worthless material. (A similar problem sabotaged _Nichijou_: too much space to fill, not enough top material.)\\n\\n\r\nSo you couldn't really compare it to better comedies like _FMP: Fumoffu_ or _Azumanga Daioh_ or better dramas like _Toradora_.",

It's really funny and i enjoyed watching it a lot but the best word that comes to mind is inconclusive. It doesn't have an ending...\r\nI'm not saying the anime is bad, in fact it's a real funny one but it just ends there, the final episode happens and everything is the same as it was when it started, nothing major happens.

            "content": "If you fancy a Romantic Comedy, chuck full of slap stick and \"chibi\" humor, this is a good anime for you. \r\nStory - The story line was good, not great but good. This is not the first time we have seen a plot of this nature of course, two youngins forced to marry each other due to unforeseen circumstances, however Seto no Hanayome takes a nice approach giving the story line a certain freshness. I did find the storyline to be a bit erratic at some points, but it always seems to come back around to a central point.\r\nArt - I thoroughly enjoyed the artin this anime. It bounces around quite frequently between a standard cartoon anime style, chibi, and even some dashes of a more realistic style without losing the viewers focus. Scenery is basic, but the artist's achieve some pretty good stills throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound - All i can really say is perfectly suited for this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - A constant barrage of new characters continuously throughout the anime leaves you feeling a bit detached from many of the characters, however there is enough focus and development of the main two characters, Seto San and Nagasumi, to give you a main focal point to ground yourself on throughout the series. There isn't really a point in the show where i didn't have a vested interest in what was going to happen to the characters in the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - While at the beginning i almost felt like the slap stick nature of the anime was being quite overtly shoved down my throat, after the series progressed passed the first few episodes i found myself being unable to tear myself away from watching. It is heart felt, the emotions are believable, and i definitely found myself laughing quite vocally often throughout the series. Overall this anime deserves a soft 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n-Shameless",

Not that I didn't enjoy Love Hina, but it's just bad in comparison. \r\nStory: 8\r\nWell I won't take long here, the story is simple and effective, and it has in my opinion one of the best endings ever made, it just fits perfectly with a balance of romace and comedy in a way that just blows my head off.\r\nArt: 9\r\nSimply Awesome, Ijust ROFL'd all over the place with the Chibi's and the faces the characters make. Although the art is kinda cutish I would call it loli, so basically I think it serves both loli and non-loli fans.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOnce again absolutely astonishing. I don't actually like much japanese songs and even so Seto No Hanayome OST as some of my all time favorite.

            "content": "When it comes to comedy there are always many ways you can aproach it, ranging from an spectrum between Really Smart and Downright Stupid, but whatever aproach you may take, if the writing and direction isn't smart and funny then it's all for naught, even if you go with something so insanelly idiotic like a mashup of the Little Mermaid, The Godfather and parodies of beloved action classics.\r\nThankfully Seto no Hanayome is smart in his implementation and you're left with a series that may drop your IQ to negative levels but pays off with excelent humour that may cheer up even the gloomiest of persons.\r\nOkayI went to far there but I don't lie when I say that Seto no Hanayome is smart about its implementation, it understands well that you cannot go with any level of seriousness when you're telling a story about a boy that ends up engaged with the beloved dauther of a mermaid Yakuza family in the shores of Japan, the same way you cannot hope to sit well in a hallowen costume party wearing a slick suit (unless you're playing G-Man).\\n\\n\r\nWhat works so well in the series in the main character Nagatsumi, who gets dropped in all kinds of ridiculous situations and his reaction to everything is always spot on, he rejoices at the good times like having a beautifull fiancee, panickes at life threatening situation but becomes so used to them that they become mundane to him, he's an easy to relate character because even though he's a boy living in a ridiculous fantasy word, he's very realisticly written. it also helps that the rest of the cast works very well, they aren't by any means deep compelling characters but they bring a lot of creativity and help up spice up the humour a lot, I don't want to give too much about them because it simply wear of their charm.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other aspects of the animation, I have to say they work well but they aren't exactly \"A\" Material, the characters look nice although it's all a bit too much \"Moe\" there are some silly traits to the animation like having rectangular irises and bleeding some sort of rainbow liquid it also doesn't help the fact that they some times go a bit overkill with their expressions and movement, sometimes less is more and you may want to slow down a little otherwise all that movement becomes too much for the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is quite good, The opening really stuck out to my head and I can even remember the lyrics even after not having watched this anime in a long time, the rest of the soundtrack fit very well with the situations and you can expect a wide variety of compossitions that fit very well with the wide array of crazy situations it throws at you, but besides of the opening (and that Enka song it plays when Sakura petals fall down, although for different reasons) the soundtrack isn't very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclussion, what I believe it's the biggest streght of this anime is that it's genuinely funny, it isn't something that's very though provoking, it's as stupid as it gets like laughing at lolcats, but sometimes all stupid entertainment is what we need just to have a very good laugh, and sometimes that's all you need.\\n\\n\r\nSeto no Hanayome really delivers in side spliting humour and you wouldn't, or better yet, couldn't have it any other way\\n\\n",

            "content": "Some people might think that being bad at swimming is normal and not much of a problem. Some people might also think that mermaids are cute lovable creatures, and in some cases they are right. But in poor Nagasumi's case his normal life is twisted as all his believes are turned against him as he is forced to \u201csleep with the fishes\u201d. Every episode includes a threat to his life and his struggles to keep his engagement a secret from normal people.\r\nThis anime has a one of a kind story line that works very well with the romantic comedy theme. I've seen many romantic comediesbut this one is a lot different from all others. The fact that they brought mythical creatures and modern reality together isn't new but is still entertaining and it works.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own weird perks and personalities who provide the funny yet life threatening situations which result in comedy gold.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is one of my favourites and I recommend every one and any one whether you're into comedy, romance or both to watch it at least once.\\n\\n\r\nPS: first review \uf04a\\n",

            "content": "In Seto no Hanyome, the story must be explained beforehand or else you will not be able to piece the story together. Anyways, lets start the review (you can read the synopsis for yourself), besides the already humorous plot idea of a human marrying a mermaid in a yakuza family, there are also two other mermaids with some delightful backgrounds: Luna, whose family is rich out of their mind and she is a sadistic and egocentric media idol, whose persona is way different from what she seems. And then there is Kai, who is an agoraphobic (fear of wide open spaces) rich boy who enjoystaking long walks on the beach with San in an astronaut suit or in a submarine. XD.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can already tell, this story has a lot to offer in the humor department and never fails to deliver that one joke you love to repeat to your friends. The action in here is as well amazing with that funny little comedic twist. Then for the actual characters, each individuals distinct habits create a chaotic comedy, the likes of one that has never been seen before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10, really this is something that should be watched and enjoyed thoroughly! And a hint of advice, don't watch this on veoh or megavideo (the resolution on the videos suck), I suggest going to animefreak.tv They have the best quality.",

This is my first time at writing a review of something so i'll do my best.\r\nSeto no Hanayime(My bride is a mermaid)\r\nI have watched/am watching a lot of rom-com series at the moment and harem, because lets face some of they are hilarious. Also they sometime have meaningfully full lesson throughout the series. (Sometimes!)\r\nWhen I was searching for series to watch, i saw this title and thought 'Well this is probably not going to be good and wont compared to the other' However i was dead wrong. The series is by far one of the funniest ihave watched so far, with the exception of a few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who loves their Rom-com/comdey or just any similar genres, i highly recommend giving this a go. It was defiantly worth watching and was a really good show.\\n\\n\r\nSo that conclude my review, Once again this was my first time writing one so go easy one me. Thanks for reading though.(With time I'm sure I'll get better) :)",
