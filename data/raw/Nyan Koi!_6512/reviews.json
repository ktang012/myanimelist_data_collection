            "content": "One of the problems with harem rom-coms these days is the tendency to try and be creative in unusual ways. The problem, specifically, is that the writers and mangaka assume that by simply including something like aliens, youkai, body switching, etc, etc, then the story automatically becomes new and innovative. \r\nFujiwara Sato, the creator of the manga upon which this anime is based, decided to adds cats. No, not catgirls, just cats (although girls are present in the story as well).\r\nNyan Koi follows the life of one Kousaka Junpei, a high schooler who lives with his mother, sister, and pet cat, but who suffers froma severe allergy to all things feline. One day he accidentally knocks the head off a statue belonging to the local cat deity, and from then on he can understand everything every cat is saying. His pet Nyamsus tells him that he has been cursed by the cat god, and that unless he helps 100 cats he will be turned into a cat himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem though, is that his allergy will kill him at that point.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I will admit to a certain bias here. This past year I have been following two particular manga dealing with cats and humans - Nyan Koi and Koi Neko, and of the two, Koi Neko has the better story. That's not to say that Nyan Koi is bad in terms of it's plot, but it does suffer from a certain genericism brought on by the fact that it's a harem story. That said, the anime adaptation follows the manga pretty well up to the last couple of episodes, at which point it goes off at a tangent. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not a bad thing mind, but in the case of Nyan Koi it feels more like an attempt to entice the viewer into watching the second series, especially as, aside from one or two hints, the events in the show don't really support most of the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the plot does have some redeeming qualities in that the humour from the manga has maintained, especially where the cats are concerned. The scripting is also well handled for the most part, barring a few odd inconsistencies come the last few episodes, however this should be no surprise given that much of the show is the anime form of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe bright and cheery colour scheme reflects the fact that this is a fairly simple harem comedy. The animation is well handled and choregraphed, and the show makes good use of different animation techniques to emphasise the humour. That said, Nyan Koi does suffer from a degree of genericism when it comes to presentation. Certain scenes are reminiscent of many other harem anime, and the characters themselves are formulaic in their designs, and this includes the cats. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound the series is well served with it's cast of voice actors, all of whom are very talented in their own right (for example, Tanaka Atsuko, who plays the role of Nyamsus, is also the actress behind Kusanagi Mokoto of GitS: SAC, 2nd Gig, 2.0 and Innocence). The one problem though, is that their talents are underused, however this is purely an outgrowth of the fact that this is a comedy show rather than a serious tale. That said, they do portray their respective characters well, especially in the more humourous moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a simple J-Pop ditty sung by Sakakibara Yui called \"Nyanderful\" that, while being upbeat, is nothing particularly special. Likewise the ED, \"Strawberry ~Amaku Setsunai Namida~\" (sung by Imai Asami), while being a more melodic than the OP, is again, nothing to write home about. \\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty the music, although being reasonably well composed, is fairly generic throughout the series, and while the choreography is fairly well handled, there is a certain lack in terms of impact because of this.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters go, they're all pretty much what one would expect from a harem comedy. That's not to say that they're bad though, as they're nicely presented for the most part. It simply means that they're formulaic and, because of this limitation, they are only allowed to develop in certain ways. However, given the mass of harem comedies appearing over the last few years it has to be said that while Nyan Koi does have generic characters, they're nowhere near as bad as some I could mention. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will point out though, is that the addition of cats, and their effect on Junpei, is actually beneficial for the series as a whole. While the overall effect isn't really telling to the viewer, the relationship between Junpei and the various felines he helps allows the viewer to relegate the harem aspect of the series, and this allows the humour to come to the fore.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will admit that I did find myself chuckling to this show, as many cat owners might find themselves doing in certain scenes. While I'm not a big fan of harem anime in general, the cats allow one to appreciate the humour in amore defined manner, and the show has less of a need to place the lead male in various ecchi sitautions in an attempt to get some laughs - something which is a big plus in my book. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the series isn't a complete transposition of the manga, it does have the benefit of allowing the viewer to appreciate the visual humour in a way that the manga just couldn't convey. That said, the last few episodes, being anime originals, do suffer because the writing in them just isn't as good as it is in the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nFans of harem comedies may be of two minds about the show to be honest. There's a number of good points to the series, however there has been no real attempt to step away from the generic nature of the typical harem anime, and this places limitations on what can and can't be done. This is actually one of the reasons why I prefer Koi Neko over Nyan Koi as, while both include cats talking to humans, Koi Neko takes a completely different approach. \\n\\n\r\nNyan Koi is enjoyable though, and it's the humour that most will appreciate come the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just a shame that the lesson of Ai Yori Aoshi (i.e. the lead male doesn't have to be generic, mediocre, or a loser), still hasn't been learned.",

            "content": "\u201cYo Kou-baka, I heard you\u2019re cursed. Wahahahaha!\u201d\r\nIf you were like me, not sure whether to try watching a show about talking cats, then rest assure because Nyan Koi is more than your average pet-talking anime! Produced by AIC, it should come as no surprise if Nyan Koi manage to remind viewers of another \u201csemi\u201d AIC production known as Seto no Hanayome. Both are considered rom-com harem and they share many common traits in my humble opinion. Thus it is very tempting to make comparisons between them, but I will restrain myself to the best of my ability to not do so too often in thereview.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the talking cats may not be the most adorable pets you have ever seen, but they are significant to the anime as they are used to push forward story events and in some cases, help develop character relations. While cats obviously do not talk like human do, but due to a curse on our protagonist Junpei, he gained the ability to communicate with them (hence the talking cat you have heard about). The story follows Junpei with his daily struggle with school, friends, love, and helping cats in need. While the plot may sound a bit generic, but what makes the show entertaining is the interaction among the characters.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMisfortune-moe\u201d is a silly term used to describe the character behavior of one of the twins in the story. As one can probably imagine, those who finds misfortunate (or sheer bad luck) to be something liked about is pretty sick and cruel as far as their character is concerned. But viewers will often find themselves helplessly laughing at the cruelty of the \u201cmisfortune-moe\u201d twin. Nyan Koi is the type of show that can bring out the funniness in even the weirdest of situations. Another entertaining character, who sadly did not have as much impact to the story as I would have liked, goes by the name of Nagi Ichinose. Here is the one flag that should make all Seto no Hanayome viewers go \u201cah, that looks (and the background music sounds) familiar \u2026 now where have I watched a similar show like that before?\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, characters in Nyan Koi all contributed in their own unique way. However one thing that seems lacking is the character growth for the \u201cslightly less important\u201d characters. We certainly witnessed development to Junpei as a character, but other equally important characters like Kanako could have had more screen time for development. Anyhow, I understand that it can be very difficult for a short 12 episodes series to have much development for its second class heroes, but it has been done before in many shows. Thus in that regard, Nyan Koi may be a bit unsatisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style is mostly refreshing and unique, but once a while there will be scenes that look rather similar to Seto no Hanayome (not the art, but the technique used to create certain atmosphere). Although not a masterpiece level in terms of animation, there isn\u2019t much that one can truly complain about. Smooth scene transition? Check. Non-repetitive scene usage? Check. Consistent animation quality? Check. Well drawn, well animated characters and pets? Check. The animation certainly is one of the stronger points of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED both are pleasant to hear; just don\u2019t expect anything catchy that could stay in your mind for more than an hour. The music department deserves some credit for matching hilarious scenes with funny BGM and so on, but they pale in comparison to the hard work of the voice acting screw, the seiyu. With great talented seiyu like Yuu Kobayashi, Ryoko Shiraishi, and most of all Jun Fukuyama, there are enough big names in the anime to attract a large number of fans (yes, in Japan seiyu are practically celebrities and have their own fan clubs etc). These skillful voice actors/actresses give life to the characters and made them much more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNyan Koi certainly brought a great deal of joy and entertainment to the viewers. The one thing AIC could work on to improve the anime is the somewhat simple, linear plot. Otherwise, the animation and characters, combined with skillful seiyu, makes this show a worthy candidate to spend your time.\\n",

            "content": "Mmmm, I see quite a few of Nyan Koi! reviews being presented at this present moment, and to be fair, if you want to read a well written review; read Archaeon's review. My review will not be as fluffy, nor as well written.\r\nNow let's start with Nyan Koi!'s biggest problem; it's a harem. Apart from harem fanboys, are there actually people that watch anime fairly objectively who enjoy harem anime? No, probably not. You know there's this thing about harem, mmm,..... what's it called? Generic? Ah yes, generic. This anime is no exception, it's generic, has a weak storyboard and try to save this alreadysinking ship (and I mean this ship, which is an analogy for the anime of course, was sinking as soon as it embarked and tried getting out of the port it was docked to) by quirking it up with cats. (The paragraphs that follow mays contain minor spolers, nothing big though.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat's worse is that it's not a consistent plot carrying feature in the anime apart from the initial introduction of this feature which causes it to become a gimmick, a side thing that takes up too much space since it's not actually important to the plot. They just sort of dropped it on the way out of convenience. Why? Because of harem, because the male main protagonist has to be loved by a horde of all the stereotypical female harem characters that the producers could find. We have the sweet girl next door, the tomboy x 2, one being a hybrid between a tomboy, tsundere/yandere and childhood friend, the other one being a sempai (in one grade higher at high school, oh!, oh! and guess what she's actually a daughter of the yakuza!)  then we have the twins, one completely open with the undying love she feels for the guy, being a bit on the freaky side with some emo stuff going on then we have the tsundere/yandere that absolutely hates him, but she it's so cute when she gets those red cheeks as she blushes when she's fighting her inner self, because she just knows she really likes him.\\n\\n\r\nI probably forgot someone, but that's the thing, the characters are so forgettable they lose all importance and since the characters lose all importance so does the anime itself. Now please, let's not fool ourselves fanboys and others, there existed no plot to speak of in this anime, if you thought there was a plot or story to talk about in this anime, you either generally have really bad perception abilities, you're a complete fanboy of harem and/or cat shows or you've simply not watched many good anime series, which is unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nThe general concencus seems to be that this anime is worthy of a rating of 8 here on mal. I mean I know the toplist here on mal is pretty biased what with the making of multiple accounts and whatnot for the purpose of messing with the toplists, but 8? I gave GTO an 8. G. T. O..... (I chose GTO arbitrarily, could have been any other of my 8's, but I think GTO speaks even more for itself than perhaps many others.)\\n\\n\r\nYes, I did watch this mainly to have something to bash on when it had finished airing, but I watch all shows objectively, I welcome all genres to try and surprise me, but Nyan Koi! did not surprise me, it is not the worst harem I've seen, but it certainly is not something I'd want to hang up my christmas tree.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading, I doubt you read all of it though, if you did I am sorry for any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes, it's just that I never recheck these reviews of crap anime I write because I simply don't care. Please do not share with me your opinion if you disagree with me because if you do you are not on the correct side of this battle we fight.",

            "content": "Nyan Koi! is a harem anime which tries its best to do something new, but unfortunately, it turns into just yet another bland series with the usual touch of supernatural in it.\r\nThe plot revolves around the male lead, Junpei, and his quest to help a hundred cats to avoid turning into a cat himself - due to a curse brought about by his own clumsiness. So every episode or so we get to see a new cat with some trouble, and our allergic hero trying his best to help the poor cat. \r\nNow unfortunately it isn't as promising as this might've sound. Nyan Koi! isa harem anime, and you'll find that it does a lot of harem-esque episodes and setting, among others the school excursion, swimming pool trip and naturally a swing to the amusement park. Most of the settings have been done before in more than one anime, and it's just being re-lived here, no genre-shaking events, no brilliance to set it out from the crowd.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show starts out the focus is much more on the cats, perhaps the reason being that all the characters aren't fully introduced yet, but it gradually turns more and more into a cheesy harem comedy, winding up as a lot more generic harem with every implication this brings forth. Dull and bland, with little to savor from it. Admittedly, it does present a few laughable moments throughout its whole, but aside that the entertainment value is very low, and unless someone is a big fan of harem series with little flair to them, it isn't worth the time it takes to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, there's nothing to write home about. Every character fills their standard harem role to an extent. The wimpy main. The wimpy main's out-of-this-world-cute love interest. The wimpy main's tombyish childhood friend. The crazy cross-dresser. Even a pair of twins; the yandere and the tsundere girls. And a crazy older girl. The others aren't much to talk about either; from the typical mom-and-sister pair to the crazed old man, and of course one or two filler guy friends of the male lead.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much that's it. They're set in stone as charcaters and have limited potential. But Nyan Koi! at least tries to use that potential, salvaging what it could from the characters to make them better than bad, if not necessarily good.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is not particularly outstanding either. The color palette is bright and rich, filled with clear and hapyp colors. The character designs aren't particularly outstanding, and rather flat. The detail put into the characters' various attires is a redeeming factor though. Overall the depth of the animation isn't very present, much due to the rather simple effort put into shadowing and light effects in general. Most of the scapes and interiors are made a tad too background-y, and as such the characters and other nonstatic objects feel slightly awkward in comparison. What it does well, however, is the visual humor. From their expressions to effects and the like, it does help in provoking a good laugh when due.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is just like the rest of the serious, rather average and nothing to really look forward to. The background music contains all the standard themes for the various harem anime situations and moods, and fits right in with said moods, but I found myself thinking how the music should've been better, which kind of deterred the mood. The opening theme is a rather typical upbeat J-pop song, with a bright, cheerful vocal line and likewise string parts. The ending theme is a tad richer in its build and thus more listen-able, but still has an air of ending theme written all over it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Nyan Koi! ends up nothing more than an average harem series with nothing in particular to add to the genre, and save for a few laughs here and there is not something worth the time it takes to watch it.",

            "content": "I must say that after the first 3 or 4 episodes I was really going for an 8 (Very Good) , but slowly I dropped at 4-5.This \"romance/comedy\" anime was one of those dissapointing shows where the producers failed miserably to develop new and unique ideas that could attract watchers.\r\nStory: 3 - Poor\r\nYes it's the same old storyline with a boy , that is surrounded by girls and has an unexpected experience that changes the way he interacts with others.Nyan Koi has by far 1 or 2 romantic moments and the \"comedy\" moments can only make you laugh about how bad these scenes were made.\r\nTherelations between the characters is simple , as Junpei doesn't get to approach them very much (few exceptions).And when you think finally something interesting happens the moment gets ruined by another character (including the cats).In some cases this could be considered funny (depending on what's happening) but after countless times it gets boring and it's not even \"funny\" , so we can't even think about enjoying this.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 - Fair\\n\r\nWhen I watch an anime I don't really care about art but indeed there are a few points that need some attention.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the characters were pretty easy to remark since they where indeed made to look different from each other , but nothing that can catch your eye was in. The design of the cats was better (um..yes better) then the characters' one: a twist of colours for each cat making it easy to remark even in a croud of cats and again, everything was defined in a boring way that doesn't attracts your eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3 - Poor\\n\r\nThe opening/ending songs are pretty lame and practically sends to the watcher \"waves\" of confusion (I mainly talk about the lyrics of the opening song) since it's not even a true love triangle (if you watched animes where there is a good accent on love triangle you know what I mean) and the curse is not an opportunity or even help to Junpei for almost all episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5 - Mediocre\\n\r\nThe characters of this series are totally predictable after watching them in action for like 5 minutes.Junpei is your nice doggy when he's around Kaede that is happy but still doesn't know how to express this (well he's a human in this anime so being incapable to discuss with the person you like it's not comic or romantic).\\n\r\nKaede is your innocent anime girl, with a childish look that could make almost all boys fall for her (in the anime of course).Of course , this innocence is taken to an extreme in situations like: talking about love, discussing with the boy she likes, understanding the meaning of things related to love, etc.She's the type of girl that would say in the middle of a Nyan Koi episode:\"Junpei, will you let me wait for you in season 2 , too?\".\\n\r\n\"Kana-chan\" is the final person completing the so-called love triangle that realize that she loves Junpei , can't confess , but she manifests in different ways.I would say that she is the most normal person from the love triangle when taking things serious and her \"cons\" are excessivly \"attacking\" Junpei and of course incapacity to make him understand what she feels. (but I guess that goes for this kind of anime , excepting one thing: see Nyan Koi , genres, ROMANCE).\\n\r\nIn this case, Junpei it's the brainless one too because he tries figuring out something at some point ..but of course fails.\\n\r\nKotone and Akari are just 2 more characters added to fill the story and make it more boring.Of course they chain some events to them so we can't say they can miss from the anime.\\n\r\nAfter watching the whole anime I really think the best character was Nyamsus (seriously).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3 - Poor\\n\r\nI can't say I enjoyed this anime.For normal people that aren't addicted to this genre and just look an anime I frankly tell you to search another one because this isn't worth wasting your time.For people addicted to comedy/rom/harem I tell you the same thing a bit more detailed.This isn't your com/rom/har anime , it's just a pathetic fail that tries to impress the watchers with lame and hilarious\\n\r\nscenes.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I truly regret watching this and I don't recommand it to you! \\n",

            "content": "And thus ends of the best and most underrated comedies of 2009.  Nyan Koi is a complete work of art.\r\n==[Pros]==\r\n- Humor.  This comedy doesn't fail to deliver on its most important aspect.  Whether it's the sudden change from Mizuno's dramatic yakuza ringtone to a completely serene scene or a shot of Junpei and the twins licking popsicles, Nyan Koi never disappoints.  The humor in this show is both crude and refined, direct and indirect.  Nyan Koi is funny, and isn't afraid to show it.\r\n- Junpei.  He is a great male lead - one of the greatest I've ever seen.At first glance, he looks average... almost... too average.  But he is the ultimate in tsukkomi, a straight man rivaling Kyon of Haruhi and Shinpachi of Gintama.  His well timed expressions can often make the worst humor (worst of the best, that is.) seem unbearably funny.\\n\\n\r\n- Humor.  Just let me say some more about this.  Basically, Nyan Koi slams you with so much unexplainable and original material that you can't predict what's going to come next.  Just when I thought the show couldn't get any more ridiculous, it did.  And it worked.  Nyan Koi is one of the few shows that can make me laugh or say \"wtf?\" at almost any given screenshot.  There's just that much humor and randomness packed into each and every episode.\\n\\n\r\n- Episodic + Continuous plot.  It's always tough for an episodic series (one that has a separate story for every episode/every few episodes) to tie the entire show together.  Often times, series fail and end up confusing their viewers and/or displaying a shabby overall plot.  Nyan Koi is the rare show that can weave together both episodic aspects and continuous aspects into the same plot with ease.  With the cat/curse objective as the episodic side and the romantic comedy as the continuous side, this show manages to present a complete picture, yet still allowing for entertaining small arcs at the same time.\\n\\n\r\n- Other characters.  All of the characters in this show are great.  Some are shallow, some have enormous depth, but all of them make me laugh.  From Kaede's almost-too-cliched airheadedness to the twins' tsundere and masochistic personalities to Junpei's gossiping mother and sister and nonexistent father, there wasn't one point in the show that I didn't like a character.  Sure, Kana looked disturbing at first, but her roles as master and childhood friend gave me so many laughs that it didn't matter after a few minutes.\\n\\n\\n\r\n==[Cons]==\\n\\n\r\n- Nekomimi.  There are none.  What the hell.\\n\\n\r\n- Misleading premise.  There are no catgirls.\\n\\n\r\n- The ending.  It was too abrupt.  Though I generally don't like deus ex machina/\"miraculous\" endings anyway, so this might just be a result of my bias.\\n\\n\\n\r\n==[Conclusion]==\\n\r\nI can't say it enough - this show was fantastic.  I didn't receive the stereotypical ecchi romantic comedy with catgirls that I thought I'd get, and instead stumbled upon a true diamond in the rough, a show so ridiculously funny that I was left stunned after every episode.  In a year filled with so many sequels and remakes, this is one new face that truly deserves another season.",

            "content": "Every season has it's own corresponding harem and ecchi anime. This was 2009 fall season's harem, and definitely an improvement to the usual. Nyan Koi! it's not an upgrade to the harem formula and doesn't add anything new to the lot but, at the end, managed to deliver lots of fun and, as a result of that, quality.\r\nAlmost everything in this show it's a bit chich\u00e9, take for example the fascination that japanese people have for animals like foxes or dogs. Now it's the cats turn; meet Kousaka Junpei, a typical 2nd year high school student alergic to cats that has been cursed. In orderto prevent his body from becoming cat-like he has to make 100 wishes come true, wishes that come from cats. Aside from being slowly transformed into a cat, the curse brings other consecuences to Jumpei: he can understand and comunicate with cats. This makes the show entertaining to a certain point. The overall plot develops based on this wishes that Jumpei grants, accompanied with lots of comedy and incredible situations along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation it's decent. It doesn't stand out a lot and it doesn't look bad either. It's just right. It haves  minor ecchi elements that go on par with the harem theme and some models, like the cats, are very funny to look at due to their diversity.\\n\\n\r\nThe music it's matched perfectly to the ambience in the anime. Nyanderful! has the perfect title and rhythm to make out an impression about the whole show at once. The BGMs are pretty lively as well and nice timed. Other than that the seiyus do a great job reflecting each of the characters personality. One of the biggest achivements this anime has acomplished; the sound and music are above average to what mostly one listens to.\\n\\n\r\nTypical coming from a harem anime we've got the classic steoreotypical characters that usually are created for this genre: the tsundere girl, the clueless girl, the yakuza-manly girl, the stalker girl and the real loved girl. The characters are funny and you get to see enough content of each one, so no specific character is missed. Added to that the cats have their own personality and problems as well, this makes the show feel somehow refreshing and unique.\\n\\n\r\nNyan Koi! it's a blast to watch, you can laugh a lot or just check it out for the harem-partly ecchi experience. This anime can be extremely entertaining if the viewer can stand the clich\u00e9s that surround it.\\n\\n\r\nSo the typical harem formula is applied: the same use of characters, situations (somebody said a pool episode?) and somehow linear chain of events. Besides that some of this events are really funny and some of the characters stand out. Lastly the voice acting is awesome and the music is applied nicely. After combining all this characteristics the final product comes out as a 'very good' one.",

            "content": "My first impression of Nyan Koi! seemed to be a lighter franchise filled with.. well.. cats.  Please read the synopsis before reading this review to familiarize yourself with the story.\r\nThis anime (short-lived only 12 eps long) is just average for an anime series.  First off, a show entirely about cats is bland.  There are all sorts of information pamphlets and such about cats, how they behave, and there are even ways to communicate with them.  For the over-the-top cat lover you might find some interest in this story.  Furthermore, this show is heavily accented with fan service (in the openingtheme of the show, each female character is given a chest/buttocks shot for reasons unfathomable).  If you want to drown yourself in the protagonist's plight to end his problems (including his romantic ones), see lots of annoying cats, and see what I originally thought was a BOY, then this show is the perfect fit.\\n\\n\r\nBut, BUT, BUTTTT... Being a cat lover myself I did have a reasonable level of enjoyment with this show as I never thought they'd throw in a love triangle with the main character and two of his classmates at school.  Character development is fair/bland at best as the trials/calamities seem very very TRIVIAL (having a crush on one another, trying so hard just to squeeze in a date or kiss).  If they had accelerated the slow pace of the storyline I could imagine more people showing interest in this series.  As stated, if you ARE a cat lover then I would recommend this show as a light escape from the more serious shows that have intrigued you for a while.",

The lyrics i mean.\\n\\n\r\n- As for BGM, i think its just so so. there is nothing special on it. \\n\\n\r\n- The OP and ED is surely attractive, but for myself, but it doesnt so catchy. so dont expect too high on this OP or ED.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 8/10\\n\r\n- In this anime, we have a tsundere girl, a twin, a machosist, and a cute girl. What else? its just full of unique girls. Well, Typical of harem anime.\\n\\n\r\n- The development between the character is maybe the biggest problem in this anime since it just got 12 episodes, but it doesnt really matter, since once again, the attractive of how Nyan Koi presents of the character is surely interesting in so many ways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\n- If you really like with harem anime, this will be worth to try. since, it was interesting for me if i should say, i've never enjoyed harem anime this much.\\n\\n\r\n- one more thing, You better put this anime into your PTW. lol.\\n",

            "content": "Nyan Koi had me hook, line and sinker at the part about cats.  In fact, that was the sole reason I picked this up, blinded by my usual bias towards these kinds of things.  Which is why I had no idea what I was getting in to.  Arguably, it was probably for the best, since I wouldn't be expecting too much out of it.\r\nDespite the fact that most of the story was episodic at best, there was some semblance of a plot.  Given the premise of our fearless protagonist trying to remove a curse from himself all the while trying tomaintain the masquerade in front of anyone else out of the loop and chasing after his clueless crush, the set up was thrown aside pretty quickly in favour of the standard romantic comedy episodes; which are not bad by themselves but it is kind of a shame.  I thought it was going to evenly split the attention between the the cats and the girls but in the end the plot ended up putting emphasis on only half of the premise.  The better half of man that is.  During my time following the show, there seemed to be only two choices of which are, introduce new character, or silly harem-induced hijinks.  That is, until the last two episodes.  I bet the writers (since the anime differs from the manga plotwise, mostly) suddenly remembered that our dear protagonist was cursed.  In the supposed finale, I was waiting for them to milk the drama for all its worth, but, apparently it isn't worth a lot given the amount of time it took to resolve the mess and it let me down.  Any consolation for the poor overall plot is in the form of a sequel hook.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a different story.  Its colourful, solid and bold.  In fact, a lot of our protagonist's feline friends are even well drawn and animated like the cutesy critters that cats are. It is hard to find fault in the art for Nyan Koi even as it shifts style for various effects.\\n\\n\r\nSound is also an artful triumph.  Though I don't follow Voice Actors, I have to give mad props to Yuu Kobayashi, Nagi's VA, who does stellar job of conveying the two extremes of character.  As for the normal background sound, we get various subtle but catchy and instantly recognisable tunes.  They'll burrow in to your ear and enhance the action on screen like any good soundtrack does.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, its unsound; the majority of characters are not given much in this department.  If there were any development it seemed I missed it.  In fact, a main offender of a rather typical archetype is Mizuno, the ditzy little lady that our protagonist has crushed on since they entered high school together.  To some, its always nice to see a cutesy character who seems to be perpetually locked out of a loop, to others, its \"been there, done that.\"  As it all centres around our male protagonist the developments the harem has towards him is almost boringly predictable.  The near uni-dimensional nature of the characters extends to our supporting cast as well, but that's to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nFlaws aside, it is supposed to elicit a chuckle and be enjoyed moment by moment.  And chuckle I did.  In fact, the nature in which I enjoyed it reminded me of another anime with humour in the same vein (which I also greatly enjoyed).  Since its a quickie, it works well for me.  Also, I love cats, so if all else fails, the cats will at the very least distract me, in a good way, with their presence.  If you are not looking for some nice and quick laughs, you might want to pass.  Best summed up as came for the cats, and stayed for the silly antics, and cats.  Oh before I forget, did I mention I love cats?",

Perhaps it just a form of Stockholm syndrome that some people can't objectively rate something when they've invested so much time to watching it. Or maybe I'm just a jerk who rates things lower than most people. \r\nAnyway... \r\nStory wise there really isn't much. A harem anime with cats as the gimmick(Somewhere along the line they add demon fighting for an episode.).  The show claims to be a romantic comedy but it isn't really romantic or funny. The climaxisn't very interesting and the ending leaves little accomplished in terms of Kousaka's relationships with the girls, and the actual plot of being cursed. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound didn't stand out to me as being either good or bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were bland and I really couldn't have cared less about any of them. Worse they never develop at all throughout the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's not the worse show out there, but I definitely would advise against putting it on your plan-to-watch list unless you really have nothing better to do.",

(I like to finish what I start, okay?)\r\nOther than talking cats, there's really nothing new here. It's just a generic anime about a guy who for some ungodly reason has a plethora of cute girls are who are into him. Like a lot of harem anime, there are moments of big-breasted-ness, panty shots, accidental groping and purposeful groping (girls groping girls) but most of the comedy in this series is supposed to be fromthe interference of Junpei's life from the cats, which he is severely allergic too. A lot of the anime is focused on Junpei juggling his need to lift his curse by helping cats and doing everyday things while the girls (Mostly Sumiyoshi and Nagi-sempai) make his life even more difficult. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters... ugh. Sumiyoshi and Mizuno were both unbearable to watch. And they were the two main love interests. Sumiyoshi is the tsundere childhood friend and Mizuno is well... the girl that's good at everything, exceptionally beautiful, feminine and loved by all... blech. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending... what ending? This series just should have ended but they left it open with no confessions of love from any character so they can have a second season. This show doesn't need a second season. Everything that's been done in it has been done before, I doubt a second season would make this any fresher than talking cats.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: this review is intended to be read after you finished the show, so you can see some idiot who dropped the show after 7 episodes ramble about the tropes he does not like.\r\nI feel as if these types of romantic comedies are exactly the same. We've seen all the same tropes countless times. I usually enjoy these tropes, but in this show, they're completely boring, and almost painful to watch. Please excuse me I am not a native English speaker.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is rather average, a lot of things are very predictable. I laugh at the show occasionally, it is funny but like I saidit's nothing we haven't seen before. I think the tasks that Junpei has to do for the cats are fairly funny, and creative, but his relationship with Kaede is what really put me off about the show. Personally I am not a fan of the ' Happy Girl', I find them to be too common in these shows, and I don't find them funny at all. They are boring. But in this show Junpei and Kaede are too similar to be in a relationship, they're more like brother and sister and it is boring beyond belief and that really put me off. The only reason I continued watching is because of Kanako. I find her relationship with Junpei to be fun and unpredictable at times, but I don't feel as if she got enough screen time. I got bored of seeing too much of Kaede, so I don't know much about the second half of the show. To summarise, the story is fairly funny, but the relationship with Junpei and Kaede is boring, and painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art was good. I think that the art style is a bit outdated, but that isn't the reason I dropped the show. I liked the colour choices they used, it's very bright and vibrant, not to mention I highly approve of those curves. (\u261d\ufe0e \u055e\u0a0a \u055e)\u261d\ufe0e . It isn't as viabrant as many other series, but it's a good 8/10. The CG sections were.... present, but I like the use of blue and yellow, and I love the designs of the cats. That is why the art is an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI don't pay attention to the sound, but seeing that I did find the music quit relaxing, I give it a 7/10. Again I don't pay attention to sound so this review will be short. Sub>Dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nPoo. I already mentioned that I don't like Kaede, the boring rom-com trope that I hope will die, but now I'll talk about Junpei. I find him to be selfish, and a small, skinny, tic-tac dick. He only cares about his relationship with whats-her-name Kate or whatever. He doesn't care about anyone else as far as I'm concerned, and he gets onto these  awkward situations without him knowing. It makes me cringe. His allergy to cats does make for some funny moments, but it only takes up about 20% of what I have watched. He's one of them male MC cliches that I like until it gets serious. Did I mention I don't like Kaede? At least she's not as bad as Asahina from Suzumiya. The only character I liked was Kanako. I find those characters fairly funny and more interesting than the boring girl that the male MC always likes. I don't like anyone except for Kanako and maybe some of the supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI find the show quite enjoyable, but when I finished an episode, my first instinct was not to watch the next episode. I never cared what happened, I just wanted to see the relationship between Junpei and Kanako grow, and the relationship between Junpei and Kaesong shatter into a million pieces, get flushed down the toilet, and go into the state drink supply, only to be urinated out, and be drunk again, until it evaporates into the sky, and fall out into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. But the cats where very funny, and provided a great alternative to the relationship between Junpei and his second sister Kaedick. They only enjoyable parts where Kanako, Ichinose, and the cats. Everything else was fairly boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe show was alright. I dropped after seeing too much of the unbearably boring 'Happy girl' but that's not what I came to see. I came to see his relationship with Kanako, and maybe the cats, but instead I got another These-Characters-Are-Too-Similar-It's-Unsettling relationships. I think there is potential for humour in these relationships, but it depends on the male MC, and whether he likes the cliche boring girl or not. I guess I didn't like the show because the show was bad, I didn't like it because I cannot stand the male MC always liking the boring girl. At least in other series it seems like by the end the MC leans towards the other, more interesting girl, but from what I've seen in this series, he ends up with ms Annoyingtrope. Then again, I couldn't finish the show because I can't stand these relationships. So mock me if you will. This concludes my review of Nyan Koi by Fujiwara Sato.",

            "content": "It is a story about a man, his cats, a harem of typical anime girls and a curse. Okay, I will try a little harder. The story is revolves around Junpei Kousaka, an average highschooler living with his mother, sister and a pet cat (we learn his father is away working but little else is said). On the walk home from school one day he accidently knocks the head of a statue of a cat deity and is cursed to turn into a cat unless he fulfils the wishes of 100 cats. \r\nThe story order and events are pretty standard. However, not everything about thiswas as typical as you would usually expect from a harem anime. For example, some the character development was actually the best parts of this anime, such as that of Junpei and Kanako (an old childhood friend of his) which develops for a minor relationship to a fully fledge relationship that really create some of the best scenes in the anime. It was also comical to a point it actually had me laughing out loud unlike most 'comedy' anime which can stifle a smile or a giggle at the best of times. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime obviously doesn't possess the gripping serious scenes which you would expect from Evangelion or the cripplingly sad scenes of an anime like Angel beat but what this anime does brilliantly is enjoyment. It is a fun anime to watch when you just want to settle and be calm after a long day and is not meant to be taken too seriously.\\n\\n\r\n However, I must say the anime on a whole strays of the main storyline of the curse and him completing it and goes into full harem/romance/comedy genre at points and that sometimes it really just become a bit too generic to a point it cannot be ignored but these are really the only major criticisms I have for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub for this anime saw some experienced voice actors comes in such as Yukari Fukui from animes such as Kill la Kill and Highschool of the Dead and Y\u016b Kobayashi from Attack on Titan and Buso Renkin but from a listening point of view nothing much more than the ordinary which goes for the dub, however I must say the role of Nagi Ichinose played by Kara Greenberg was brilliantly done and added to the comical sense of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion if you are looking for a fun and comical anime that you can just lose yourself in and don\u2019t have to take too seriosuly, then look no further than Nyan Koi!\\n",

            "content": "Too much and not enough are equally big problems when trying to create something amazing - or in other words know when to say when. In the case of Nyan Koi! someone should have stopped the onslaught of nonsensical girls sooner and not stopped the plot as soon as they did. \r\nI know what you're thinking, \"but it's a harem show - there's supposed to be tons of girls.\" BUT Nyan Koi sacrificed being a good romantic comedy or a good small harem (does 2-3 count as a harem?) for being a sloppy very mediocre harem rom-com of which there are all ready many outthere. Half way through they just threw away the decent plot and the few good characters they had, and said \"screw it, this is hard just draw more girls\". If you still feel their choice was justified you must be a 15 year old boy because plot does matter even in harems.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first couple of episodes I rated this show as 7/8 by the end it was 4/5 so I went with a 6 for overall for the following reasons:\\n\\n\r\nSo about the story...as you may have already gathered Junpei is a young man who has always been terribly allergic to cats. One day he accidentally destroys a cat statue in a local shrine and is then cursed by the cat god. As penance to have the curse lifted and thus avoid being turned into a cat, which would certainly be fatal for him, he must help 100 cats with their problems. This is a pretty unique and good story line that has lots of potential for comedic moments. The funniest parts of the show are Junpie is trying to fulfill cats' requests, and it would have been so great if they had stuck with the story past episode 7 or 8 because it was genuinely entertaining. By the end it seems like the writers forgot that was a major part of the story because it is barely included anymore, although in episode 12 they seem to recover from their amnesia in time for a hurried conclusion. The first love triangle is pretty good - there's a girl Jupei likes who secretly likes him back and his childhood friend who he has grown apart from but still has a crush on him - it's pretty believable, cute and ripe for awkward moments and confusion. The rest is downhill from there as several random girls fall for him with barely even weak attempts at explanations on the writers' part.\\n\\n\r\nJunpei is an unusually good lead male. He's helpless enough that it's cute, but not so helpless you want to punch him. Unlike many other harem guys, I do see why the girls like him (the first couple anyway) - he's cute and a little awkward but sweet. The first 2 girls are pretty good as well - a shy cute and awkward girl with a heart of gold and the rough and tumble but good natured tomboy. The rest of the girls might work as side characters in a different show because they have interesting and funny personalities, but in the context of just trying to get with Jupei they end up seeming utterly silly and ridculous. The best characters are the cast of cats who Junpei needs to help - each one is unique and all of them are hysterical. I wish we had seen more of them becuase they were so much better than most of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe art while not spectacular, was pretty good. I liked the use of color, andoverall  it seemed to be executed with reasonable skill. The character design seemed fitting, and the girls were cute (with big boobs) without being stupid or offensive looking.\\n\\n\r\nIt might be worth watching the first 6-7 episodes of this show then just skipping to the last one - you won't miss much.",

            "content": "One of the problems with harem rom-coms these days is the tendency to try and be creative in unusual ways. The problem, specifically, is that the writers and mangaka assume that by simply including something like aliens, youkai, body switching, etc, etc, then the story automatically becomes new and innovative. \r\nFujiwara Sato, the creator of the manga upon which this anime is based, decided to adds cats. No, not catgirls, just cats (although girls are present in the story as well).\r\nNyan Koi follows the life of one Kousaka Junpei, a high schooler who lives with his mother, sister, and pet cat, but who suffers froma severe allergy to all things feline. One day he accidentally knocks the head off a statue belonging to the local cat deity, and from then on he can understand everything every cat is saying. His pet Nyamsus tells him that he has been cursed by the cat god, and that unless he helps 100 cats he will be turned into a cat himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem though, is that his allergy will kill him at that point.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I will admit to a certain bias here. This past year I have been following two particular manga dealing with cats and humans - Nyan Koi and Koi Neko, and of the two, Koi Neko has the better story. That's not to say that Nyan Koi is bad in terms of it's plot, but it does suffer from a certain genericism brought on by the fact that it's a harem story. That said, the anime adaptation follows the manga pretty well up to the last couple of episodes, at which point it goes off at a tangent. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not a bad thing mind, but in the case of Nyan Koi it feels more like an attempt to entice the viewer into watching the second series, especially as, aside from one or two hints, the events in the show don't really support most of the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the plot does have some redeeming qualities in that the humour from the manga has maintained, especially where the cats are concerned. The scripting is also well handled for the most part, barring a few odd inconsistencies come the last few episodes, however this should be no surprise given that much of the show is the anime form of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe bright and cheery colour scheme reflects the fact that this is a fairly simple harem comedy. The animation is well handled and choregraphed, and the show makes good use of different animation techniques to emphasise the humour. That said, Nyan Koi does suffer from a degree of genericism when it comes to presentation. Certain scenes are reminiscent of many other harem anime, and the characters themselves are formulaic in their designs, and this includes the cats. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound the series is well served with it's cast of voice actors, all of whom are very talented in their own right (for example, Tanaka Atsuko, who plays the role of Nyamsus, is also the actress behind Kusanagi Mokoto of GitS: SAC, 2nd Gig, 2.0 and Innocence). The one problem though, is that their talents are underused, however this is purely an outgrowth of the fact that this is a comedy show rather than a serious tale. That said, they do portray their respective characters well, especially in the more humourous moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a simple J-Pop ditty sung by Sakakibara Yui called \"Nyanderful\" that, while being upbeat, is nothing particularly special. Likewise the ED, \"Strawberry ~Amaku Setsunai Namida~\" (sung by Imai Asami), while being a more melodic than the OP, is again, nothing to write home about. \\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty the music, although being reasonably well composed, is fairly generic throughout the series, and while the choreography is fairly well handled, there is a certain lack in terms of impact because of this.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters go, they're all pretty much what one would expect from a harem comedy. That's not to say that they're bad though, as they're nicely presented for the most part. It simply means that they're formulaic and, because of this limitation, they are only allowed to develop in certain ways. However, given the mass of harem comedies appearing over the last few years it has to be said that while Nyan Koi does have generic characters, they're nowhere near as bad as some I could mention. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will point out though, is that the addition of cats, and their effect on Junpei, is actually beneficial for the series as a whole. While the overall effect isn't really telling to the viewer, the relationship between Junpei and the various felines he helps allows the viewer to relegate the harem aspect of the series, and this allows the humour to come to the fore.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will admit that I did find myself chuckling to this show, as many cat owners might find themselves doing in certain scenes. While I'm not a big fan of harem anime in general, the cats allow one to appreciate the humour in amore defined manner, and the show has less of a need to place the lead male in various ecchi sitautions in an attempt to get some laughs - something which is a big plus in my book. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the series isn't a complete transposition of the manga, it does have the benefit of allowing the viewer to appreciate the visual humour in a way that the manga just couldn't convey. That said, the last few episodes, being anime originals, do suffer because the writing in them just isn't as good as it is in the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nFans of harem comedies may be of two minds about the show to be honest. There's a number of good points to the series, however there has been no real attempt to step away from the generic nature of the typical harem anime, and this places limitations on what can and can't be done. This is actually one of the reasons why I prefer Koi Neko over Nyan Koi as, while both include cats talking to humans, Koi Neko takes a completely different approach. \\n\\n\r\nNyan Koi is enjoyable though, and it's the humour that most will appreciate come the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just a shame that the lesson of Ai Yori Aoshi (i.e. the lead male doesn't have to be generic, mediocre, or a loser), still hasn't been learned.",

            "content": "\u201cYo Kou-baka, I heard you\u2019re cursed. Wahahahaha!\u201d\r\nIf you were like me, not sure whether to try watching a show about talking cats, then rest assure because Nyan Koi is more than your average pet-talking anime! Produced by AIC, it should come as no surprise if Nyan Koi manage to remind viewers of another \u201csemi\u201d AIC production known as Seto no Hanayome. Both are considered rom-com harem and they share many common traits in my humble opinion. Thus it is very tempting to make comparisons between them, but I will restrain myself to the best of my ability to not do so too often in thereview.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the talking cats may not be the most adorable pets you have ever seen, but they are significant to the anime as they are used to push forward story events and in some cases, help develop character relations. While cats obviously do not talk like human do, but due to a curse on our protagonist Junpei, he gained the ability to communicate with them (hence the talking cat you have heard about). The story follows Junpei with his daily struggle with school, friends, love, and helping cats in need. While the plot may sound a bit generic, but what makes the show entertaining is the interaction among the characters.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMisfortune-moe\u201d is a silly term used to describe the character behavior of one of the twins in the story. As one can probably imagine, those who finds misfortunate (or sheer bad luck) to be something liked about is pretty sick and cruel as far as their character is concerned. But viewers will often find themselves helplessly laughing at the cruelty of the \u201cmisfortune-moe\u201d twin. Nyan Koi is the type of show that can bring out the funniness in even the weirdest of situations. Another entertaining character, who sadly did not have as much impact to the story as I would have liked, goes by the name of Nagi Ichinose. Here is the one flag that should make all Seto no Hanayome viewers go \u201cah, that looks (and the background music sounds) familiar \u2026 now where have I watched a similar show like that before?\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, characters in Nyan Koi all contributed in their own unique way. However one thing that seems lacking is the character growth for the \u201cslightly less important\u201d characters. We certainly witnessed development to Junpei as a character, but other equally important characters like Kanako could have had more screen time for development. Anyhow, I understand that it can be very difficult for a short 12 episodes series to have much development for its second class heroes, but it has been done before in many shows. Thus in that regard, Nyan Koi may be a bit unsatisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style is mostly refreshing and unique, but once a while there will be scenes that look rather similar to Seto no Hanayome (not the art, but the technique used to create certain atmosphere). Although not a masterpiece level in terms of animation, there isn\u2019t much that one can truly complain about. Smooth scene transition? Check. Non-repetitive scene usage? Check. Consistent animation quality? Check. Well drawn, well animated characters and pets? Check. The animation certainly is one of the stronger points of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED both are pleasant to hear; just don\u2019t expect anything catchy that could stay in your mind for more than an hour. The music department deserves some credit for matching hilarious scenes with funny BGM and so on, but they pale in comparison to the hard work of the voice acting screw, the seiyu. With great talented seiyu like Yuu Kobayashi, Ryoko Shiraishi, and most of all Jun Fukuyama, there are enough big names in the anime to attract a large number of fans (yes, in Japan seiyu are practically celebrities and have their own fan clubs etc). These skillful voice actors/actresses give life to the characters and made them much more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNyan Koi certainly brought a great deal of joy and entertainment to the viewers. The one thing AIC could work on to improve the anime is the somewhat simple, linear plot. Otherwise, the animation and characters, combined with skillful seiyu, makes this show a worthy candidate to spend your time.\\n",

            "content": "Mmmm, I see quite a few of Nyan Koi! reviews being presented at this present moment, and to be fair, if you want to read a well written review; read Archaeon's review. My review will not be as fluffy, nor as well written.\r\nNow let's start with Nyan Koi!'s biggest problem; it's a harem. Apart from harem fanboys, are there actually people that watch anime fairly objectively who enjoy harem anime? No, probably not. You know there's this thing about harem, mmm,..... what's it called? Generic? Ah yes, generic. This anime is no exception, it's generic, has a weak storyboard and try to save this alreadysinking ship (and I mean this ship, which is an analogy for the anime of course, was sinking as soon as it embarked and tried getting out of the port it was docked to) by quirking it up with cats. (The paragraphs that follow mays contain minor spolers, nothing big though.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat's worse is that it's not a consistent plot carrying feature in the anime apart from the initial introduction of this feature which causes it to become a gimmick, a side thing that takes up too much space since it's not actually important to the plot. They just sort of dropped it on the way out of convenience. Why? Because of harem, because the male main protagonist has to be loved by a horde of all the stereotypical female harem characters that the producers could find. We have the sweet girl next door, the tomboy x 2, one being a hybrid between a tomboy, tsundere/yandere and childhood friend, the other one being a sempai (in one grade higher at high school, oh!, oh! and guess what she's actually a daughter of the yakuza!)  then we have the twins, one completely open with the undying love she feels for the guy, being a bit on the freaky side with some emo stuff going on then we have the tsundere/yandere that absolutely hates him, but she it's so cute when she gets those red cheeks as she blushes when she's fighting her inner self, because she just knows she really likes him.\\n\\n\r\nI probably forgot someone, but that's the thing, the characters are so forgettable they lose all importance and since the characters lose all importance so does the anime itself. Now please, let's not fool ourselves fanboys and others, there existed no plot to speak of in this anime, if you thought there was a plot or story to talk about in this anime, you either generally have really bad perception abilities, you're a complete fanboy of harem and/or cat shows or you've simply not watched many good anime series, which is unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nThe general concencus seems to be that this anime is worthy of a rating of 8 here on mal. I mean I know the toplist here on mal is pretty biased what with the making of multiple accounts and whatnot for the purpose of messing with the toplists, but 8? I gave GTO an 8. G. T. O..... (I chose GTO arbitrarily, could have been any other of my 8's, but I think GTO speaks even more for itself than perhaps many others.)\\n\\n\r\nYes, I did watch this mainly to have something to bash on when it had finished airing, but I watch all shows objectively, I welcome all genres to try and surprise me, but Nyan Koi! did not surprise me, it is not the worst harem I've seen, but it certainly is not something I'd want to hang up my christmas tree.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading, I doubt you read all of it though, if you did I am sorry for any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes, it's just that I never recheck these reviews of crap anime I write because I simply don't care. Please do not share with me your opinion if you disagree with me because if you do you are not on the correct side of this battle we fight.",

            "content": "Nyan Koi! is a harem anime which tries its best to do something new, but unfortunately, it turns into just yet another bland series with the usual touch of supernatural in it.\r\nThe plot revolves around the male lead, Junpei, and his quest to help a hundred cats to avoid turning into a cat himself - due to a curse brought about by his own clumsiness. So every episode or so we get to see a new cat with some trouble, and our allergic hero trying his best to help the poor cat. \r\nNow unfortunately it isn't as promising as this might've sound. Nyan Koi! isa harem anime, and you'll find that it does a lot of harem-esque episodes and setting, among others the school excursion, swimming pool trip and naturally a swing to the amusement park. Most of the settings have been done before in more than one anime, and it's just being re-lived here, no genre-shaking events, no brilliance to set it out from the crowd.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show starts out the focus is much more on the cats, perhaps the reason being that all the characters aren't fully introduced yet, but it gradually turns more and more into a cheesy harem comedy, winding up as a lot more generic harem with every implication this brings forth. Dull and bland, with little to savor from it. Admittedly, it does present a few laughable moments throughout its whole, but aside that the entertainment value is very low, and unless someone is a big fan of harem series with little flair to them, it isn't worth the time it takes to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, there's nothing to write home about. Every character fills their standard harem role to an extent. The wimpy main. The wimpy main's out-of-this-world-cute love interest. The wimpy main's tombyish childhood friend. The crazy cross-dresser. Even a pair of twins; the yandere and the tsundere girls. And a crazy older girl. The others aren't much to talk about either; from the typical mom-and-sister pair to the crazed old man, and of course one or two filler guy friends of the male lead.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much that's it. They're set in stone as charcaters and have limited potential. But Nyan Koi! at least tries to use that potential, salvaging what it could from the characters to make them better than bad, if not necessarily good.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is not particularly outstanding either. The color palette is bright and rich, filled with clear and hapyp colors. The character designs aren't particularly outstanding, and rather flat. The detail put into the characters' various attires is a redeeming factor though. Overall the depth of the animation isn't very present, much due to the rather simple effort put into shadowing and light effects in general. Most of the scapes and interiors are made a tad too background-y, and as such the characters and other nonstatic objects feel slightly awkward in comparison. What it does well, however, is the visual humor. From their expressions to effects and the like, it does help in provoking a good laugh when due.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is just like the rest of the serious, rather average and nothing to really look forward to. The background music contains all the standard themes for the various harem anime situations and moods, and fits right in with said moods, but I found myself thinking how the music should've been better, which kind of deterred the mood. The opening theme is a rather typical upbeat J-pop song, with a bright, cheerful vocal line and likewise string parts. The ending theme is a tad richer in its build and thus more listen-able, but still has an air of ending theme written all over it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Nyan Koi! ends up nothing more than an average harem series with nothing in particular to add to the genre, and save for a few laughs here and there is not something worth the time it takes to watch it.",

            "content": "I must say that after the first 3 or 4 episodes I was really going for an 8 (Very Good) , but slowly I dropped at 4-5.This \"romance/comedy\" anime was one of those dissapointing shows where the producers failed miserably to develop new and unique ideas that could attract watchers.\r\nStory: 3 - Poor\r\nYes it's the same old storyline with a boy , that is surrounded by girls and has an unexpected experience that changes the way he interacts with others.Nyan Koi has by far 1 or 2 romantic moments and the \"comedy\" moments can only make you laugh about how bad these scenes were made.\r\nTherelations between the characters is simple , as Junpei doesn't get to approach them very much (few exceptions).And when you think finally something interesting happens the moment gets ruined by another character (including the cats).In some cases this could be considered funny (depending on what's happening) but after countless times it gets boring and it's not even \"funny\" , so we can't even think about enjoying this.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 - Fair\\n\r\nWhen I watch an anime I don't really care about art but indeed there are a few points that need some attention.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the characters were pretty easy to remark since they where indeed made to look different from each other , but nothing that can catch your eye was in. The design of the cats was better (um..yes better) then the characters' one: a twist of colours for each cat making it easy to remark even in a croud of cats and again, everything was defined in a boring way that doesn't attracts your eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3 - Poor\\n\r\nThe opening/ending songs are pretty lame and practically sends to the watcher \"waves\" of confusion (I mainly talk about the lyrics of the opening song) since it's not even a true love triangle (if you watched animes where there is a good accent on love triangle you know what I mean) and the curse is not an opportunity or even help to Junpei for almost all episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5 - Mediocre\\n\r\nThe characters of this series are totally predictable after watching them in action for like 5 minutes.Junpei is your nice doggy when he's around Kaede that is happy but still doesn't know how to express this (well he's a human in this anime so being incapable to discuss with the person you like it's not comic or romantic).\\n\r\nKaede is your innocent anime girl, with a childish look that could make almost all boys fall for her (in the anime of course).Of course , this innocence is taken to an extreme in situations like: talking about love, discussing with the boy she likes, understanding the meaning of things related to love, etc.She's the type of girl that would say in the middle of a Nyan Koi episode:\"Junpei, will you let me wait for you in season 2 , too?\".\\n\r\n\"Kana-chan\" is the final person completing the so-called love triangle that realize that she loves Junpei , can't confess , but she manifests in different ways.I would say that she is the most normal person from the love triangle when taking things serious and her \"cons\" are excessivly \"attacking\" Junpei and of course incapacity to make him understand what she feels. (but I guess that goes for this kind of anime , excepting one thing: see Nyan Koi , genres, ROMANCE).\\n\r\nIn this case, Junpei it's the brainless one too because he tries figuring out something at some point ..but of course fails.\\n\r\nKotone and Akari are just 2 more characters added to fill the story and make it more boring.Of course they chain some events to them so we can't say they can miss from the anime.\\n\r\nAfter watching the whole anime I really think the best character was Nyamsus (seriously).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3 - Poor\\n\r\nI can't say I enjoyed this anime.For normal people that aren't addicted to this genre and just look an anime I frankly tell you to search another one because this isn't worth wasting your time.For people addicted to comedy/rom/harem I tell you the same thing a bit more detailed.This isn't your com/rom/har anime , it's just a pathetic fail that tries to impress the watchers with lame and hilarious\\n\r\nscenes.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I truly regret watching this and I don't recommand it to you! \\n",

            "content": "And thus ends of the best and most underrated comedies of 2009.  Nyan Koi is a complete work of art.\r\n==[Pros]==\r\n- Humor.  This comedy doesn't fail to deliver on its most important aspect.  Whether it's the sudden change from Mizuno's dramatic yakuza ringtone to a completely serene scene or a shot of Junpei and the twins licking popsicles, Nyan Koi never disappoints.  The humor in this show is both crude and refined, direct and indirect.  Nyan Koi is funny, and isn't afraid to show it.\r\n- Junpei.  He is a great male lead - one of the greatest I've ever seen.At first glance, he looks average... almost... too average.  But he is the ultimate in tsukkomi, a straight man rivaling Kyon of Haruhi and Shinpachi of Gintama.  His well timed expressions can often make the worst humor (worst of the best, that is.) seem unbearably funny.\\n\\n\r\n- Humor.  Just let me say some more about this.  Basically, Nyan Koi slams you with so much unexplainable and original material that you can't predict what's going to come next.  Just when I thought the show couldn't get any more ridiculous, it did.  And it worked.  Nyan Koi is one of the few shows that can make me laugh or say \"wtf?\" at almost any given screenshot.  There's just that much humor and randomness packed into each and every episode.\\n\\n\r\n- Episodic + Continuous plot.  It's always tough for an episodic series (one that has a separate story for every episode/every few episodes) to tie the entire show together.  Often times, series fail and end up confusing their viewers and/or displaying a shabby overall plot.  Nyan Koi is the rare show that can weave together both episodic aspects and continuous aspects into the same plot with ease.  With the cat/curse objective as the episodic side and the romantic comedy as the continuous side, this show manages to present a complete picture, yet still allowing for entertaining small arcs at the same time.\\n\\n\r\n- Other characters.  All of the characters in this show are great.  Some are shallow, some have enormous depth, but all of them make me laugh.  From Kaede's almost-too-cliched airheadedness to the twins' tsundere and masochistic personalities to Junpei's gossiping mother and sister and nonexistent father, there wasn't one point in the show that I didn't like a character.  Sure, Kana looked disturbing at first, but her roles as master and childhood friend gave me so many laughs that it didn't matter after a few minutes.\\n\\n\\n\r\n==[Cons]==\\n\\n\r\n- Nekomimi.  There are none.  What the hell.\\n\\n\r\n- Misleading premise.  There are no catgirls.\\n\\n\r\n- The ending.  It was too abrupt.  Though I generally don't like deus ex machina/\"miraculous\" endings anyway, so this might just be a result of my bias.\\n\\n\\n\r\n==[Conclusion]==\\n\r\nI can't say it enough - this show was fantastic.  I didn't receive the stereotypical ecchi romantic comedy with catgirls that I thought I'd get, and instead stumbled upon a true diamond in the rough, a show so ridiculously funny that I was left stunned after every episode.  In a year filled with so many sequels and remakes, this is one new face that truly deserves another season.",

            "content": "Every season has it's own corresponding harem and ecchi anime. This was 2009 fall season's harem, and definitely an improvement to the usual. Nyan Koi! it's not an upgrade to the harem formula and doesn't add anything new to the lot but, at the end, managed to deliver lots of fun and, as a result of that, quality.\r\nAlmost everything in this show it's a bit chich\u00e9, take for example the fascination that japanese people have for animals like foxes or dogs. Now it's the cats turn; meet Kousaka Junpei, a typical 2nd year high school student alergic to cats that has been cursed. In orderto prevent his body from becoming cat-like he has to make 100 wishes come true, wishes that come from cats. Aside from being slowly transformed into a cat, the curse brings other consecuences to Jumpei: he can understand and comunicate with cats. This makes the show entertaining to a certain point. The overall plot develops based on this wishes that Jumpei grants, accompanied with lots of comedy and incredible situations along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation it's decent. It doesn't stand out a lot and it doesn't look bad either. It's just right. It haves  minor ecchi elements that go on par with the harem theme and some models, like the cats, are very funny to look at due to their diversity.\\n\\n\r\nThe music it's matched perfectly to the ambience in the anime. Nyanderful! has the perfect title and rhythm to make out an impression about the whole show at once. The BGMs are pretty lively as well and nice timed. Other than that the seiyus do a great job reflecting each of the characters personality. One of the biggest achivements this anime has acomplished; the sound and music are above average to what mostly one listens to.\\n\\n\r\nTypical coming from a harem anime we've got the classic steoreotypical characters that usually are created for this genre: the tsundere girl, the clueless girl, the yakuza-manly girl, the stalker girl and the real loved girl. The characters are funny and you get to see enough content of each one, so no specific character is missed. Added to that the cats have their own personality and problems as well, this makes the show feel somehow refreshing and unique.\\n\\n\r\nNyan Koi! it's a blast to watch, you can laugh a lot or just check it out for the harem-partly ecchi experience. This anime can be extremely entertaining if the viewer can stand the clich\u00e9s that surround it.\\n\\n\r\nSo the typical harem formula is applied: the same use of characters, situations (somebody said a pool episode?) and somehow linear chain of events. Besides that some of this events are really funny and some of the characters stand out. Lastly the voice acting is awesome and the music is applied nicely. After combining all this characteristics the final product comes out as a 'very good' one.",

            "content": "My first impression of Nyan Koi! seemed to be a lighter franchise filled with.. well.. cats.  Please read the synopsis before reading this review to familiarize yourself with the story.\r\nThis anime (short-lived only 12 eps long) is just average for an anime series.  First off, a show entirely about cats is bland.  There are all sorts of information pamphlets and such about cats, how they behave, and there are even ways to communicate with them.  For the over-the-top cat lover you might find some interest in this story.  Furthermore, this show is heavily accented with fan service (in the openingtheme of the show, each female character is given a chest/buttocks shot for reasons unfathomable).  If you want to drown yourself in the protagonist's plight to end his problems (including his romantic ones), see lots of annoying cats, and see what I originally thought was a BOY, then this show is the perfect fit.\\n\\n\r\nBut, BUT, BUTTTT... Being a cat lover myself I did have a reasonable level of enjoyment with this show as I never thought they'd throw in a love triangle with the main character and two of his classmates at school.  Character development is fair/bland at best as the trials/calamities seem very very TRIVIAL (having a crush on one another, trying so hard just to squeeze in a date or kiss).  If they had accelerated the slow pace of the storyline I could imagine more people showing interest in this series.  As stated, if you ARE a cat lover then I would recommend this show as a light escape from the more serious shows that have intrigued you for a while.",

The lyrics i mean.\\n\\n\r\n- As for BGM, i think its just so so. there is nothing special on it. \\n\\n\r\n- The OP and ED is surely attractive, but for myself, but it doesnt so catchy. so dont expect too high on this OP or ED.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 8/10\\n\r\n- In this anime, we have a tsundere girl, a twin, a machosist, and a cute girl. What else? its just full of unique girls. Well, Typical of harem anime.\\n\\n\r\n- The development between the character is maybe the biggest problem in this anime since it just got 12 episodes, but it doesnt really matter, since once again, the attractive of how Nyan Koi presents of the character is surely interesting in so many ways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\n- If you really like with harem anime, this will be worth to try. since, it was interesting for me if i should say, i've never enjoyed harem anime this much.\\n\\n\r\n- one more thing, You better put this anime into your PTW. lol.\\n",

            "content": "Nyan Koi had me hook, line and sinker at the part about cats.  In fact, that was the sole reason I picked this up, blinded by my usual bias towards these kinds of things.  Which is why I had no idea what I was getting in to.  Arguably, it was probably for the best, since I wouldn't be expecting too much out of it.\r\nDespite the fact that most of the story was episodic at best, there was some semblance of a plot.  Given the premise of our fearless protagonist trying to remove a curse from himself all the while trying tomaintain the masquerade in front of anyone else out of the loop and chasing after his clueless crush, the set up was thrown aside pretty quickly in favour of the standard romantic comedy episodes; which are not bad by themselves but it is kind of a shame.  I thought it was going to evenly split the attention between the the cats and the girls but in the end the plot ended up putting emphasis on only half of the premise.  The better half of man that is.  During my time following the show, there seemed to be only two choices of which are, introduce new character, or silly harem-induced hijinks.  That is, until the last two episodes.  I bet the writers (since the anime differs from the manga plotwise, mostly) suddenly remembered that our dear protagonist was cursed.  In the supposed finale, I was waiting for them to milk the drama for all its worth, but, apparently it isn't worth a lot given the amount of time it took to resolve the mess and it let me down.  Any consolation for the poor overall plot is in the form of a sequel hook.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a different story.  Its colourful, solid and bold.  In fact, a lot of our protagonist's feline friends are even well drawn and animated like the cutesy critters that cats are. It is hard to find fault in the art for Nyan Koi even as it shifts style for various effects.\\n\\n\r\nSound is also an artful triumph.  Though I don't follow Voice Actors, I have to give mad props to Yuu Kobayashi, Nagi's VA, who does stellar job of conveying the two extremes of character.  As for the normal background sound, we get various subtle but catchy and instantly recognisable tunes.  They'll burrow in to your ear and enhance the action on screen like any good soundtrack does.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, its unsound; the majority of characters are not given much in this department.  If there were any development it seemed I missed it.  In fact, a main offender of a rather typical archetype is Mizuno, the ditzy little lady that our protagonist has crushed on since they entered high school together.  To some, its always nice to see a cutesy character who seems to be perpetually locked out of a loop, to others, its \"been there, done that.\"  As it all centres around our male protagonist the developments the harem has towards him is almost boringly predictable.  The near uni-dimensional nature of the characters extends to our supporting cast as well, but that's to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nFlaws aside, it is supposed to elicit a chuckle and be enjoyed moment by moment.  And chuckle I did.  In fact, the nature in which I enjoyed it reminded me of another anime with humour in the same vein (which I also greatly enjoyed).  Since its a quickie, it works well for me.  Also, I love cats, so if all else fails, the cats will at the very least distract me, in a good way, with their presence.  If you are not looking for some nice and quick laughs, you might want to pass.  Best summed up as came for the cats, and stayed for the silly antics, and cats.  Oh before I forget, did I mention I love cats?",

Perhaps it just a form of Stockholm syndrome that some people can't objectively rate something when they've invested so much time to watching it. Or maybe I'm just a jerk who rates things lower than most people. \r\nAnyway... \r\nStory wise there really isn't much. A harem anime with cats as the gimmick(Somewhere along the line they add demon fighting for an episode.).  The show claims to be a romantic comedy but it isn't really romantic or funny. The climaxisn't very interesting and the ending leaves little accomplished in terms of Kousaka's relationships with the girls, and the actual plot of being cursed. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound didn't stand out to me as being either good or bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were bland and I really couldn't have cared less about any of them. Worse they never develop at all throughout the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's not the worse show out there, but I definitely would advise against putting it on your plan-to-watch list unless you really have nothing better to do.",

(I like to finish what I start, okay?)\r\nOther than talking cats, there's really nothing new here. It's just a generic anime about a guy who for some ungodly reason has a plethora of cute girls are who are into him. Like a lot of harem anime, there are moments of big-breasted-ness, panty shots, accidental groping and purposeful groping (girls groping girls) but most of the comedy in this series is supposed to be fromthe interference of Junpei's life from the cats, which he is severely allergic too. A lot of the anime is focused on Junpei juggling his need to lift his curse by helping cats and doing everyday things while the girls (Mostly Sumiyoshi and Nagi-sempai) make his life even more difficult. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters... ugh. Sumiyoshi and Mizuno were both unbearable to watch. And they were the two main love interests. Sumiyoshi is the tsundere childhood friend and Mizuno is well... the girl that's good at everything, exceptionally beautiful, feminine and loved by all... blech. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending... what ending? This series just should have ended but they left it open with no confessions of love from any character so they can have a second season. This show doesn't need a second season. Everything that's been done in it has been done before, I doubt a second season would make this any fresher than talking cats.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: this review is intended to be read after you finished the show, so you can see some idiot who dropped the show after 7 episodes ramble about the tropes he does not like.\r\nI feel as if these types of romantic comedies are exactly the same. We've seen all the same tropes countless times. I usually enjoy these tropes, but in this show, they're completely boring, and almost painful to watch. Please excuse me I am not a native English speaker.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is rather average, a lot of things are very predictable. I laugh at the show occasionally, it is funny but like I saidit's nothing we haven't seen before. I think the tasks that Junpei has to do for the cats are fairly funny, and creative, but his relationship with Kaede is what really put me off about the show. Personally I am not a fan of the ' Happy Girl', I find them to be too common in these shows, and I don't find them funny at all. They are boring. But in this show Junpei and Kaede are too similar to be in a relationship, they're more like brother and sister and it is boring beyond belief and that really put me off. The only reason I continued watching is because of Kanako. I find her relationship with Junpei to be fun and unpredictable at times, but I don't feel as if she got enough screen time. I got bored of seeing too much of Kaede, so I don't know much about the second half of the show. To summarise, the story is fairly funny, but the relationship with Junpei and Kaede is boring, and painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art was good. I think that the art style is a bit outdated, but that isn't the reason I dropped the show. I liked the colour choices they used, it's very bright and vibrant, not to mention I highly approve of those curves. (\u261d\ufe0e \u055e\u0a0a \u055e)\u261d\ufe0e . It isn't as viabrant as many other series, but it's a good 8/10. The CG sections were.... present, but I like the use of blue and yellow, and I love the designs of the cats. That is why the art is an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI don't pay attention to the sound, but seeing that I did find the music quit relaxing, I give it a 7/10. Again I don't pay attention to sound so this review will be short. Sub>Dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nPoo. I already mentioned that I don't like Kaede, the boring rom-com trope that I hope will die, but now I'll talk about Junpei. I find him to be selfish, and a small, skinny, tic-tac dick. He only cares about his relationship with whats-her-name Kate or whatever. He doesn't care about anyone else as far as I'm concerned, and he gets onto these  awkward situations without him knowing. It makes me cringe. His allergy to cats does make for some funny moments, but it only takes up about 20% of what I have watched. He's one of them male MC cliches that I like until it gets serious. Did I mention I don't like Kaede? At least she's not as bad as Asahina from Suzumiya. The only character I liked was Kanako. I find those characters fairly funny and more interesting than the boring girl that the male MC always likes. I don't like anyone except for Kanako and maybe some of the supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI find the show quite enjoyable, but when I finished an episode, my first instinct was not to watch the next episode. I never cared what happened, I just wanted to see the relationship between Junpei and Kanako grow, and the relationship between Junpei and Kaesong shatter into a million pieces, get flushed down the toilet, and go into the state drink supply, only to be urinated out, and be drunk again, until it evaporates into the sky, and fall out into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. But the cats where very funny, and provided a great alternative to the relationship between Junpei and his second sister Kaedick. They only enjoyable parts where Kanako, Ichinose, and the cats. Everything else was fairly boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe show was alright. I dropped after seeing too much of the unbearably boring 'Happy girl' but that's not what I came to see. I came to see his relationship with Kanako, and maybe the cats, but instead I got another These-Characters-Are-Too-Similar-It's-Unsettling relationships. I think there is potential for humour in these relationships, but it depends on the male MC, and whether he likes the cliche boring girl or not. I guess I didn't like the show because the show was bad, I didn't like it because I cannot stand the male MC always liking the boring girl. At least in other series it seems like by the end the MC leans towards the other, more interesting girl, but from what I've seen in this series, he ends up with ms Annoyingtrope. Then again, I couldn't finish the show because I can't stand these relationships. So mock me if you will. This concludes my review of Nyan Koi by Fujiwara Sato.",

            "content": "It is a story about a man, his cats, a harem of typical anime girls and a curse. Okay, I will try a little harder. The story is revolves around Junpei Kousaka, an average highschooler living with his mother, sister and a pet cat (we learn his father is away working but little else is said). On the walk home from school one day he accidently knocks the head of a statue of a cat deity and is cursed to turn into a cat unless he fulfils the wishes of 100 cats. \r\nThe story order and events are pretty standard. However, not everything about thiswas as typical as you would usually expect from a harem anime. For example, some the character development was actually the best parts of this anime, such as that of Junpei and Kanako (an old childhood friend of his) which develops for a minor relationship to a fully fledge relationship that really create some of the best scenes in the anime. It was also comical to a point it actually had me laughing out loud unlike most 'comedy' anime which can stifle a smile or a giggle at the best of times. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime obviously doesn't possess the gripping serious scenes which you would expect from Evangelion or the cripplingly sad scenes of an anime like Angel beat but what this anime does brilliantly is enjoyment. It is a fun anime to watch when you just want to settle and be calm after a long day and is not meant to be taken too seriously.\\n\\n\r\n However, I must say the anime on a whole strays of the main storyline of the curse and him completing it and goes into full harem/romance/comedy genre at points and that sometimes it really just become a bit too generic to a point it cannot be ignored but these are really the only major criticisms I have for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub for this anime saw some experienced voice actors comes in such as Yukari Fukui from animes such as Kill la Kill and Highschool of the Dead and Y\u016b Kobayashi from Attack on Titan and Buso Renkin but from a listening point of view nothing much more than the ordinary which goes for the dub, however I must say the role of Nagi Ichinose played by Kara Greenberg was brilliantly done and added to the comical sense of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion if you are looking for a fun and comical anime that you can just lose yourself in and don\u2019t have to take too seriosuly, then look no further than Nyan Koi!\\n",

            "content": "Too much and not enough are equally big problems when trying to create something amazing - or in other words know when to say when. In the case of Nyan Koi! someone should have stopped the onslaught of nonsensical girls sooner and not stopped the plot as soon as they did. \r\nI know what you're thinking, \"but it's a harem show - there's supposed to be tons of girls.\" BUT Nyan Koi sacrificed being a good romantic comedy or a good small harem (does 2-3 count as a harem?) for being a sloppy very mediocre harem rom-com of which there are all ready many outthere. Half way through they just threw away the decent plot and the few good characters they had, and said \"screw it, this is hard just draw more girls\". If you still feel their choice was justified you must be a 15 year old boy because plot does matter even in harems.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first couple of episodes I rated this show as 7/8 by the end it was 4/5 so I went with a 6 for overall for the following reasons:\\n\\n\r\nSo about the story...as you may have already gathered Junpei is a young man who has always been terribly allergic to cats. One day he accidentally destroys a cat statue in a local shrine and is then cursed by the cat god. As penance to have the curse lifted and thus avoid being turned into a cat, which would certainly be fatal for him, he must help 100 cats with their problems. This is a pretty unique and good story line that has lots of potential for comedic moments. The funniest parts of the show are Junpie is trying to fulfill cats' requests, and it would have been so great if they had stuck with the story past episode 7 or 8 because it was genuinely entertaining. By the end it seems like the writers forgot that was a major part of the story because it is barely included anymore, although in episode 12 they seem to recover from their amnesia in time for a hurried conclusion. The first love triangle is pretty good - there's a girl Jupei likes who secretly likes him back and his childhood friend who he has grown apart from but still has a crush on him - it's pretty believable, cute and ripe for awkward moments and confusion. The rest is downhill from there as several random girls fall for him with barely even weak attempts at explanations on the writers' part.\\n\\n\r\nJunpei is an unusually good lead male. He's helpless enough that it's cute, but not so helpless you want to punch him. Unlike many other harem guys, I do see why the girls like him (the first couple anyway) - he's cute and a little awkward but sweet. The first 2 girls are pretty good as well - a shy cute and awkward girl with a heart of gold and the rough and tumble but good natured tomboy. The rest of the girls might work as side characters in a different show because they have interesting and funny personalities, but in the context of just trying to get with Jupei they end up seeming utterly silly and ridculous. The best characters are the cast of cats who Junpei needs to help - each one is unique and all of them are hysterical. I wish we had seen more of them becuase they were so much better than most of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe art while not spectacular, was pretty good. I liked the use of color, andoverall  it seemed to be executed with reasonable skill. The character design seemed fitting, and the girls were cute (with big boobs) without being stupid or offensive looking.\\n\\n\r\nIt might be worth watching the first 6-7 episodes of this show then just skipping to the last one - you won't miss much.",

(I'm canadian so it is \"OU\" >.> ) This anime revolves mainly around cats & comedy :D \r\nIt's suppose to have romance, and it does but it doesn't overpower the anime with JUST ROMANCE so don't get confused and be like \"ughh another anime with a random guy and all the girls want him\" because IT IS and it turned out pretty cool! Asides from other animes (shounen or harem whatever) this one comes up with reasons .___. notjust randomly falling in love cus he's hot! T-T\\n\\n\r\nIt has a solid story, I liked that it was different or idk haven't watched all animes but for me, it was original. The art is pretty neat too. \\n\\n\r\nI'm giving it a 10/10 because it is AWESOME. I might be an amateur in anime (only been watching for around 3 years) but it is worth watching. All characters have a develop and overcome situations. There's no such thing as an original personality so I won't be saying that. All the personalities are nowadays the same...\\n\\n\r\nGive it a try, it's only 12 episodes long T__T c'mon you can watch that in a day.",

            "content": "So have you ever wondered what would happen if you pissed off a animal\u2019s shrine? They are just like human shrines and would curse you of course. That\u2019s pretty much how this story starts. A guy breaks a shrine for a cat and so is cursed by being able to talk to cats. Wouldn\u2019t be so bad if he wasn\u2019t allergic. Add this to a slice of life school life anime like this and well\u2026. you have Nyan Koi. \r\nWhat kind of family would keep a cat when their son is allergic to them? At least get him some meds or something for it becauseit\u2019s really taking over his life. They are jerks in that aspect. Almost all the people around him are jerks to a pretty big extent. Take for example Kanako who is a perfect example of a Tsundere character. She always fights with him, even when she finds out what she hated him for was her own misunderstanding. All the characters are pretty much normal characters you would expect from a school life anime. The dunce love interest, the Tsundere and childhood friend, the crazy butch girl, the stacker, and the almost nonexistent male friends for the main character\u2026 It\u2019s a basic romance. And then there is the random mail carrier who always gets lost. She has pretty much no reason to even be part of the show, just for comedic affect I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty ok, looking very similar to that of newer shows but you can tell that something isn\u2019t exactly right. I\u2019m not really sure what it is but as I sit and watch the show, it leaves a strange feeling when looking at the art style. Its that little bit of something off that makes this show hard to watch, not just because of the voices that I will get to in a bit. Weather it\u2019s the faces looking a bit too pointy, Junpei\u2019s eye balls looking really small, or even the background\u2026 I just can\u2019t get into how the designs are for this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe English voices are very close to ear shattering with how that script was made. Sometimes I want to bang my head against the desk with out annoying many of the characters sound including the main character. They all just sound stupid and the only thing that seems to save it (And that is very rare) is when Nyamsus talks about some things even though she has the voice of a smoker. Marcy Bannor who dubs her sounds like a raspy old timer. I guess that\u2019s what she needed to be but it\u2019s hard to listen to against all the other voices. Junpei sounds like a typical guy and yet seems to be too loud no matter what he is doing. Even when he\u2019s trying to be quiet, he has a forceful tone that is way to loud for it like he has one volume. Kaede sounds like a dunce, especially when talking to Junpei. In fact, I think she is the only one out of the whole world who does not get that Junpei has a crush on her. That is exactly how she sounds too. You might say that\u2019s good script writing or dubbing but it\u2019s hard to listen to the whole time. That and Kanako screaming and fighting all the time and you make one show that is very hard on the ears.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a ok show but I couldn\u2019t marathon it. Between the animation and the voice acting, it just seemed to whittle me down. And like most shows that are based on the manga, they didn\u2019t even give it a second season to have a decent ending.\\n",

            "content": "Brief Summary: Rating: 7 (Good)\r\nA consistent Rom/Com harem with a solid love triangle, fueled by a quirky premise.\r\nLong Summary:\r\nNyan Koi! is about a boy, Kousaka Junpei, that becomes cursed and can now talk to cats, and has to grant the requests of a hundred cats or else he'll turn into a cat himself. Naturally, he's allergic to cats, and even more naturally, he can't tell anyone about the curse or else it'll make the curse even worse. This hinders his plans at pursuing the girl of his dreams, and causes other girls to enter his life. \r\nThis may sound like a typical Rom/Com harem, wherea nondescript high school boy gains a power/gets put in a weird situation and suddenly girls start randomly falling in love with him. While Nyan Koi! doesn't do anything particularly significant in straying from this formula, the character relationships and comedy do make Nyan Koi! a lot more enjoyable than many of its mediocre peers.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nThe story is a mixture of romantic and comedic moments, as Junpei struggles to rid himself of the cat curse by interacting with cats as he deals with all the girls around him. The anime doesn't waste much time in setting up the cat curse, and does a good job of never straying from the curse as the central concept. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy and romance are both presented at a good pace, despite its short 12 episode length, and the story makes sure to give time to all major supporting characters as well. A couple things come out of the blue (such as the real professions of the twins), but in general the story stays consistent to its themes and isn't overbearing on either the comedy nor the romance aspects.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nThe art in Nyan Koi! is appropriate for an anime airing in Fall 2009, with clear, distinctive character designs and detailed backgrounds. In particular, the cat designs were good, because it was not difficult to see a cat once and be able to identify that same cat later on in the series, which really helped make the cats become good supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs matched the lighthearted feel of the anime,  and the soundtrack as a whole, while nothing special, fit appropriately. The VAs were all solid as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\nI felt the characters in Nyan Koi! are what makes the series better than many other Rom/Com harems, because in general the more important characters have good, sensible core inspirations and motivations (core being a key word) that don't solely stem from the cat curse. However, the characters manage to avoid being predictable by being willing to alter their perspectives in situations that warrant it, instead of being totally clueless or stubborn in their beliefs. \\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters are unbearably offensive or annoying, but still manage to have interesting enough traits to create a lot of funny moments. The members of the love triangle still suffer from some level of denseness, as usual, but it's a tolerable level.\\n\\n\r\nMore importantly, Junpei, while relatively nondescript like most male leads, manages to avoid being unusually clumsy, stupid, dense, perverted, heroic, etc. Furthermore, most of the situations he gets into are because of his unluckiness, rather than numbskullness or pervsion on his part (exceptions do apply). This allowed me to enjoy the anime more, since I didn't have to constantly question the intelligence/motivations of the main character.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Rating: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nNyan Koi! isn't a must watch, but if you're a fan of the genre, it's worth checking out. It's lighthearted and amusing, and while you won't be struck by a feeling of awe after watching, you likely won't be disappointed either.",

Forgive me.\r\n Why did I chose to watch this anime?\r\n- harem\r\n- take a break from some serious-plotted anime\r\n- got tired of 'watching only 7.5+ scores anime' \r\n- stress relieve due to my upcoming finals\r\nStory:\r\n(insert synopsis here). Pretty good idea for a story line. Comedy is fine. I think the execution could be better since I was expecting much more focus on the main character's everyday 'cat request' curse thingy. \r\nFor the harem and romance part, well, pretty generic but not the worst. Same old cool lines and stuff. Mochizuki lacks of screen time BTW. Come on, no love forsenpais? \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nGreat art, animation and drawings. Beautiful characters designs too. The 2009 art style really brings me back to the past though. Nothing to complain much here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is the one which made my reminiscing more stronger. I literally can't get the tune out from my head while trying to fall asleep LOL. But anyways, love the OP.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects, music theme, all fits pretty nicely to the setting/scene/mood. But the cat's voice though, for some reason it felt pretty weird at first but you'll probably get used to it after a while.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nLovely characters and I like the main character's personality. Not much drama and pretty straight to the point. Like I said previously, Mochizuki needs more screen time though. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI even managed to finish this series more faster than the others. I like it. Wish it there's more 'cat request' though. That's all. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI've actually learned something valuable from judging an anime between its score and actual enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nFor this anime, if you need to take a break from heavy-plot anime, I can recommend this one. Pretty cute, relaxing and heart-warming. No deep ass drama or tension. Just watch with an open mind.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was taking a break from anime for a long while, and I figured I would try to get back into it with Nyan Koi! serving as a gateway. I admit, the first few episodes were much better than I expected, and I was excited to watch more. I was actually having fun, most of the time I just force myself to laugh at comedy anime like this, but this one had me genuinely smiling and laughing.\r\nHowever, as I continued with the rest of the series, I was pretty disappointed. The main appeal to me, was the humor, and that's how it should be, NyanKoi! being a harem and comedy after all, but I couldn't help but feel like the comedy portion of the anime was dragged out and eventually got repetitive. The gags and jokes in the beginning, that initially made me laugh, were used over and over, lessening the effect of the humor. I mean, I still kind of laughed a good few times, but not as much as before. Maybe, it was because I was having high hopes after a marvelous first, second, third, fourth episode, that the rest seemed bad in comparison. But, despite that, the episodes in its entirety were fairly good enough to keep me invested.\\n\\n\r\nThere are flaws, as goes with every anime, and a good portion of them were the generic character designs, lack of a unique lead, and generic characters themselves (there's also the dragged out jokes and gags I already talked about). So, Nyan Koi! is the textbook definition of generic, with the only distinguishing aspect being it involves dealing with cat problems. Yes, but for a generic anime, Nyan Koi! was one of the underrated and better ones. I actually really liked the male lead. He's pretty dense, not Itsuka level dense, however, he's one of the most entertaining characters that I've seen, in terms of how the usual harem lead goes. In addition to the likable harem lead, there's also other equally likable characters, not just the ones in the main man's harem circle, but the supporting characters were also pretty entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOne issue that I couldn't let go, though, was the kind of rushed ending. As the anime was coming to a close, it seemed to not have enough time for a great conclusion. The ending looked a bit rushed, and it doesn't help that they give hints to a second season, which I later found out isn't likely to happen (considering the anime is 8 years old now, by the time of this review).\\n\\n\r\nI guess, overall, if you want to have a decent cast of characters, a likable male lead, and an overall fun time, then this is most likely what you're looking for. I didn't enjoy it as much as I would've liked, moreso because of my own expectations, but for you, you may have a better experience, and a whole much more better time.",

            "content": "Ah, Nyan Koi. One of my first and favorite anime that I had ever watched as a kid when I was being introduced into anime. This will be a long one, so bear with me folks!\r\nStory: (6/10)\r\nA BRIEF SUMMARY: (You don't have to read this you know. Just read the synopsis!) One day, the main character Kousaka, Junpei, a high school student, walks home after from school. On the way home, he sees an empty can on the road 'waiting' to be recycled. Instead of picking it up like 'any' bystander would do, he decides to kick it instead into the trash can. Unfortunately, thecan whirls out the trash can, and breaks off the head of the cat statue that happened to be there. On the next day, he is cursed as he knowingly can hear and talk to cats. To lift this curse off of him, a cat Tama tells him that he must be willing to fulfill 100 requests from the cats with all his sincerity and to not to tell anyone about the curse or else he will turn into a cat. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fairly decent. Not the best, but it was indeed fun to look at! Especially when it came to the OP and ED art designs. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is extremely catchy, as it matched the tone coming into the anime which was one of it's a strong point in this anime. That can also be applied to the ED as well. The OSTs however were limited and overused in some moments of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s):\\n\\n\r\nSince I've watched many kinds of anime, I know what cliches and stereotypes about a high-school, romantic-comedy, ecchi, harem might have.  (That's a lot of genre tags there.) Especially when it comes down to this anime. You got the 'dull MC', the 'moe', the 'childhood friend', the 'twin-tailed tsundere', the college student who like to drink a lot, and etc. But, when it comes to the characters however, expect each and every one of them with interesting personalities. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this anime was decent as I fairly enjoyed the anime throughout! \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nAs a kid, this anime was one of childhood favorites. Now, that I've come back to re-watch it again, it's just your typical high-school, romance, comedy, harem, ecchi anime. (That's a lot of genre tags there.) But, overall what makes it worth your time though is how the romance (even though it was a 'bit' forced) and comedy (even though it was a 'bit' exaggerated), is what made this anime fun to watch! \\n\\n\r\n(SPOILER) \\n\\n\r\nWhat's disappointing however is that this anime doesn't end with the MC ending up with someone. Leaving (you) viewers wanting to know 'who' and 'who' ends up together. Unfortunately, the story is left without another season and without a conclusive ending. The reason behind all this, is because the manga is left unfinished, for quite some time now, as the manga also leaves to an inconclusive ending as well. The manga has been on haitus since then, and there are no news about it continuing disappointingly. As of right now, we won't know for sure if there will ever be a concluded story of Nyan Koi in the near future. Just read a fan-fiction who ends up with who, that would be my advice!\\n\\n\r\nTo paraphrase it, don't watch it if you don't like inconclusive endings! Well, that's my review folks! Sorry for the long review!",

When it comes to Romance/Harem animes I tend to look at the artwork + the babes. If it looks nice and the babes look like they could fool with the protagonists heart a bit I'm all for it.\r\nLuckily I gave Nyan Koi! I shot since I fairly enjoyed it. I am almost finished with it andit has had it's fair share of hilarity. At the beginning it's a little bit slow but once all the characters are introduced then I had a good share of laughs. \\n\\n\r\nI think you should give it a shot if you're interested and see how you like it.",

            "content": "\"My days of misfortune have only just begun!\"\r\n- Junpei Kousaka\r\nStory:  7/10\r\nThe story is pretty good, well-paced, and well thought out. The only fault I found with the story is that it just ends. Very little is resolved, and the creators pretty much say \u201cRead the manga to find out more.\u201d And to that I say, \u201cOh, I will.\u201d As of the time of me writing this review, the manga is still ongoing.   \r\nCharacters:  8/10\r\nThe characters are varied and have their own reasons for being here. Keep in mind this is a harem-themed series, so they all share a mutual love interest.But they all like Junpei for different reasons. Whether it is due to him helping out, being childhood friends, comforting another due to fears,  or one of them just having a misfortune fetish, they all like him for different reasons and that is what makes them strong characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:  7/10\\n\r\nAnimation is decent if somewhat childish. But that childish style is the animations\u2019 strong point. This is an extravagant rom-com (romantic-comedy) and the style really suits it. It displays the annoyance of Junpei and the shy, awkward moments really well; all while still maintaining a decent style, overall. They spared little to no detail at all, and one character was never animated better than another, with the exception of Junpei in certain circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:  5/10\\n\r\nAside from the opening and ending, there were not any really worthwhile soundtracks that were present until the last episode. Or at least that is when I really noticed it. There were inserts of comical sounds here and there, but they were often repeated and rather short.  \\n\\n\r\n-Genre-Based-\\n\\n\r\nComedy:  10/10\\n\r\nBeing a rom-com, comedy had better been up there, and Nyan-Koi! delivers. There was not a single episode that I did not laugh. Sure I did not cry from laughing, but I don\u2019t need to in order to give a perfect score for comedy.  \\n\\n\r\nDrama:  5/10\\n\r\nBeing a harem-theme series and all the girls sharing one mutual love interest, there is bound to be drama. This anime did not have much, though I suspect the manga to have more. What little this anime did have, however, is worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nRomance:  6/10\\n\r\nBeing a rom-com I was expecting more romance, this anime did not deliver on that aspect. If you are looking for a romance where the main character gets with the lead role or in this case anyone, then look elsewhere. This genre falls because the story failed to come to a close. I suspect that the manga will have a more fulfilling romantic plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:   7/10\\n\r\nA worthwhile watch and I would recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a rom-com that has a unique plot device to it. \\n\\n",

Unrequited love scenes are quite common, and concept of moe is strong (look at OP).\r\nStory:8\r\nOriginal story about someone who is cursed, but is weak against the attributes of the curse and even have to repenting thru doing things weak to the guy. However, note: Allergies, curse, fear of cats are inconsistent throughout the series, they come and go.\r\nStoryline was pretty original for the episodes introducing the characters, and hadkept the main focus on track throughout the series. However, after introduction of the characters, there was a lot of harem and fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of content other than the main plot was added, thus the main plot was not fully developed, and only in the last few episodes were there complications regarding the pliot and finally a climax. Halfway felt like Hiyoko Brand anime, kinda mono. Romance was scarace since the harem seemed mostly stagnant.\\n\\n\r\nEnding was kinda rushed and unsatisfactory. Cliffhangers remain, especially with the harem. \\n\\n\r\nOne bonus to this anime is that the atmosphere/mood stayed relatively constant throughout the series compared to Princess Diaries, and it is overall quite a relaxing series.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nArt was good especially with some special effects, like the magical shoujo episode and the climatic scene in the last episode. The rest were good, though nothing spectecular.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nKudos to the OP and ED. The lyrics of OP was especially well written and the ED was extremely fitting with the series, and there were tons of characters and cats in the story, which the voices brought out the personalities well with.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there were a lot of parts where some bgm could have made the mood better instead of mere narration.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\r\nWay too many characters, too little development, even on some of the main ones. Character distribution throughout the series was rather random, some disappear for a few episodes before being involved again, while Junpei's father just come and go. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters' personalities were rather stable throughout the series, although lack of development made the whole series a little over on-the-surface.\\n\\n\r\nThe main male character had a cat allergy, yet he seemed unaffected for most of the times he makes contact with cats. Plus the curse didn't seem to deteriorate until the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on a last note, there were a lot of personalities presented, making the harem interesting yet complex: tsundere, airhead, sadist, etc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7\\n\r\nWell, I enjoyed OP and ED and Mewview very much as they tell you 1 fun fact about cats every week. The relaxed mood of the series was good too, not much serious harem vying or so on. But, the lack of romance movement spoils the mood, with some of the main characters not confessing and not responding even when they knew their feelings for each other.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, halfway through the series, I realised that there was only one main plot moving: helping 100 cats so that the curse can be broken (well this is in the 1st episode so I dun think this is a spoiler, plus later on they dun even care about the number anymore).\\n\\n\r\nAnd eh... there were some conditions attached to it, but only in the last few episodes do you see the conditions being activated. And even in the last few episodes you still can see fan service. All in all, the plot is disappointing and this hurts the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you like cats you should like this series much more than me :D .\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nActually is 6-8. I gave this series a 8 cos it was presented well, although there were some flaws with the content. Cats were heavily featured in this series, although some scenes with the cats seem strange.\\n\\n\r\nEnding was pretty strange (given how the curse was broken), along with cliffhangers in relationships and poor ending of the romance between the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nPlus: At the 11 min of the last episode of Nyan Koi, \"Um, there's no season 2\" was said by Minoru in one commercial scene. Then come the last few mins of the episode, and there was some hints of a second season. This is confusing, isn't it?",

After knocking the head off a neko-statue, he is cursed by a deity and told he must both worship cats and also appease 100 kitties or he will be turned into a feline himself! This plot line takes a backseat to the developing harem Junpei finds forming around himself, even though he is only interested in the coy Kaede. Addressing all aspects of male fantasies, the barrage of moe, tsundere, kindergarten friend and twins that the unappreciative male finds flocking to him somehow seems more believable than many othersimilar ecchi titles.\\n\\n\r\nAs the episodes tumble aside effortlessly, the writer's come up with new and creative ways of torturing the poor protagonist; from an aggressive challenge from tomboy Nagi - who suddenly takes a liking to the curvaceous Kanako\u2019s sweater-puppies, to the mysterious twins with contrasting personalities who both love and hate the brow-beaten schoolboy, Junpei's misery is what makes the show so humorous. Although Nyan Koi\u2019s strange pretence eventually transforms into a typical harem, its friendships and group dynamics are what keep the show a step ahead of the competition.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there is a sense of \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d with certain romantic aspects of the show, an abundance of bizarre genres save Nyan Koi from becoming a bland snooze-fest. The typical swimsuit and hot spring features are redeemed with magical girl transformations and moments of outright ecchi. It is often the small things that stand out, and usually the perverted ones at that, but a series that makes you laugh out loud is definitely not one to be ignored.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: \r\nThe story of Nyan Koi! was decent. It is basically a love story with comedy incorporated into it.The protagonist Junpei K\u014dsaka has a crush on a girl who loves cats yet he's allergic to them. From reading this one line summary you can probably identify the irony from the plot. As mentioned above, the story was decent, but for me the funny comments here and there are what made the show interesting. It follows the archetype of one guy having a crush on a single girl and then having numerous girls falling for him. Just to make it interesting, his crush is on anairhead blonde who isn't aware of his feelings and eventually as the plot progresses she  begins to develop feelings for Junpei. After watching a variety of shows you can probably predict a vague version of the story. There aren't really any interesting twists in the plot, however it is enjoyable to sit through and passes by relatively fast.\\n\\n\r\nComedy:\\n\r\nI had to make a different section for this because this either makes or breaks the show. I enjoyed the comedy. It made me laugh every here and there. The jokes are somewhat dirty. I liked them being a teenager with the references to puberty. The protagonists interest in girls tends to be good fillers along the way, however do not take this the wrong way. This is not a comedy. In my opinions it is more of a traditional love story with an odd event (cursed cat statue) tied in to make it seem unique.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was great. I was stunned when I began watching (I watched HD videos if it makes a difference). The art was easy on the eyes and didn't take any adjusting like katanagatari.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nFair. No real songs just filler music along the way chosen to try and change the mood. Nothing really called out to me music wise. The voices were great! Each person matched the character and everything seemed to be in well order. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nJunpei was a well developed character. Truly, the characers I really liked were the mail carrier woman (for comedy), Junpei's mother and sister (for comedy), and the twins (for comedy). You can probably see what I'm talking about here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEasy watch goes by fast. The short series actually serves to benefit this series. Doesn't feel dragged on. BEWARE, to me, this series didn't give me a nostalgic feeling probably because there aren't enough episodes for character development. You don't really form a bond with the characters throughout the series.",

An 8 would mean very good, which it wasnot. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music. Even less remarkable. I found myself skipping the OP and ending after the 2nd episode. SFX and soundtrack were... again, normal.\\n\\n\r\nWhat characters can you expect from an average harem anime? You might experience feelings of nostalgia from watching the show. Why? Because you've SEEN THEM ALL BEFORE. The cats were cute, that's it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a cookie-cutter harem, I did laugh at some bits. I guess there is some merit at following time and tested formulas then.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think you still want to watch this, I suggest you just read the manga.
