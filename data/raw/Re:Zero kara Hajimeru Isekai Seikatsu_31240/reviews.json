            "content": "Re:Zero truly wanted to be something. It shoots for the stars, it tries new things and throws the characters through so much torture and misery that the fantasy-world they are living in resembles more a hell. They boil in this hell, fuming with anger and regret, any shred of happiness they find fading almost immediately to nothing. \r\nBut Re:Zero isn't something. It reaches for its dear, dear life, but remains in the end wholly unremarkable shounen fare interested more in shocking the viewer with gore and theatrics than in telling a genuinely meaningful story. Re:Zero may not be terrible and irredeemable, but it certainly strugglesthroughout most of its twenty-five episodes to demonstrate that there is more to it than this. What is there in Subaru's tragic story that the audience can take with them at the end? What does it want to say? Not a whole lot, to be sure. Re:Zero is ambitious in mediocrity, notable only for its perverted sense of drama. \\n\\n\r\n(Minor spoilers will follow from here, as it is near-impossible to discuss an anime like this without revealing anything.)\\n\\n\r\nI have seen many people compare Re:Zero to Steins;Gate in the months since its airing. This is a great disservice to Steins;Gate. Where Steins;Gate spent nearly half its runtime developing the setting and its characters before asking the audience to empathise with and feel for them, Re:Zero does so immediately and does not ever ask for consent. It never develops its setting in any meaningful way-- about all you know for the duration of the story is that it is generic fantasy-land where people hate witches and bad things happen all the time-- and it throws death and gore at the viewer from the very first episode, when nobody even knows or cares about who Subaru is. It is shocking to see major characters die within the first episode, to be fair, but it no longer feels shocking the second, third or eleventh time. \\n\\n\r\nIf there was any consequence to these events, it is immediately brought to nothing by the show's contrived gimmick of rebirth and time-travel. It doesn't really matter if someone does die, as time will conveniently bend backwards for Subaru's sake-- never to the beginning, and always to the last major event in the story. There is no cost and no meaning to anything that happens. Subaru's mistakes are immediately erased upon rebirth, and he can go on about his day with nothing but his own guilt holding him back. He is the God of his story and the world is his playground. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Re:Zero does to compensate for this is killing its characters off in increasingly brutal ways. They will lose their limbs, be hacked to death by chains or tortured to the point where they no longer resemble a human being. It is violence without meaning, as artificial as can be, extreme and over-the-top to the point that it can almost at times resemble satire. Everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong for Subaru and friends, long before you are given any reason to care about their fates\u3000in the first place. The fifteenth episode is easily the biggest offender in this regard as it is nothing more than one massive slaughterfest, intent on making you feel bad for Subaru and his many waifus, him screaming in rage and gurgling on blood like it is some sort of torture porn. It is entirely possible for fiction to contain elements of death and gore without it negatively affecting the story, and in some cases it is even necessary, as it is for stories focused on issues such as war. Death is an entirely natural phenomenon, and humans are evidently not above committing acts such as murder. The issue with Re:Zero is that its death and gore exists for itself. It exists to shock and enrage the viewer, rather than serving as a product of the setting or as a vehicle for more substantial themes. For some people, this works, and throwing a character through a hurricane of awfulness is enough to instil sympathy. That's great, and I don't hold any ill will against these people. If anything, I am envious of how easily they can feel emotion. What actually bothers me is how effortless this method of storytelling truly is, and the audacity Re:Zero has to pretend it is something profound and on-par with film, as it did in the credits of the fifteenth episode. Re:Zero is visceral and sensually striking, and yet ever so empty. \\n\\n\r\n\"Empty\" can easily be used to describe the characters as well. Emilia, for example, exists as little more than a personification of the average anime fan's ideal woman, similar in many ways to Asuna from Sword Art Online, and lacking in any meaningful characterisation besides her occasionally getting upset at Subaru. It's even more baffling that Subaru chooses her in the world of romance when she has done very little to win over his affection or  help him, aside from giving him a place to stay for a couple days. She may as well not even exist-- the only reason she even does is to create more senseless tragedy for Subaru. \\n\\n\r\nRem and Ram are much better characters, as they actually have legitimate characterisation, backstory and development over the course of the story. The issue with them, particularly Rem, is that this development occurs so suddenly that it feels more like a complete change in character than an extension of who they really are. Rem  goes from hating Subaru's guts to being so completely in-love with him that she is willing to follow him to the ends of the Earth and sacrifice anything for his sake. To be fair, there is reason for this abrupt change in personality: Subaru is one of the only people who has ever shown her kindness, and he did so selflessly, on several occasions, without regard for his own safety. He does a great deal to win over her trust and respect. But the extent to which she loves him, especially when she was still cursing his name just a couple short episodes before, is so extreme that it feels less like a natural progression of her feelings and more a way to instil feelings of love in the viewer, to make her palatable to otaku, an ideal girlfriend of sorts, a \"waifu\" much as Emilia is. It is very hard to convince me that her feelings are anything more than a fleeting puppy-love when merely showing her a bit of kindness is enough to immediately turn Subaru from her most-hated person in the world to her most-cherished one. It feels fake-- it feels like a lie, as many things in Re:Zero are revealed to be.\\n\\n\r\nBetelguese, as creepy a bastard as he is, is by far one of the most obnoxious presences in the entire show. He is there, presumably, to create a sense of horror, as he will bend his body in unnatural ways, chew off his fingers in anger and bleed from his creepy little eyeballs, among other things. In reality, he is so loony and ridiculous that anything he says or does feels immediately silly, destroying any of the supposed horror he was supposed to generate. See, the thing most anime get wrong with horror (and indeed even most fiction in general) is that a truly terrifying character is not a raging lunatic, but rather someone totally ordinary and conscious of their actions. Hannibal Lecter is scary. Betelguese is anything but. If you want me to feel scared, do so in a way that resembles a reality humans can actually relate to, rather than a fantasy made of the likes of ghosts and goblins and bowl-cutted priests who eat their fingers for no reason. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the side characters are weak and one-dimensional as well, as they either serve as more empty harem material (with flat-out catgirls and lolis), are defined by a single-trait or  catchphrase (as Beatrice and Roswaal are), or are there as a weak attempt to instil more horror, like the stupid kid on the carriage (whose name I forget because I was too busy being angry at his annoying voice and how dumb the scene was) who completely breaks character and turns into a raging lunatic in another shallow attempt to push the story in a dark direction. The one main exception is Wilhelm, whose backstory and motivations truly do feel meaningful and justified. It is just a shame that he is immediately thrown to the benches again once this backstory reaches its quick end, serving afterwards as little more than some old dude who is skilled with the sword. \\n\\n\r\nThis leaves our buddy Subaru. I think, without exception, he is the factor that determines one's enjoyment of Re:Zero. If you can put up with his utter stupidity, you will find it possible to empathise with the trauma he goes through and his mental breakdowns that follow. If you are annoyed and disgusted with his presence (as I regularly was), it will be virtually impossible to care about most of what occurs. Subaru is the difference between being a fan of Re:Zero and being someone who actively dislikes it.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, he resembles a typical shounen hero. He is hot-headed, makes frequent out-of-place jokes (which I never once found funny, by the way), and refuses to ever think things through in a logical process, preferring instead to jump into battles he cannot win or to lash out at innocent people merely because his pride and fragile ego are called into question by his own mistakes. He thinks he is the coolest dude in the world, that he can save everyone through his own power, and the mere presence of someone with more skill than him offends him right to the very core. He yells and cries on a regular basis and seems incapable of having a normal conversation with anyone. Subaru is a child, and without any doubt one of the more infuriating characters I have witnessed in perhaps ever. There were points in the story where his characterisation legitimately made me angry and made me want to stop watching the show. Some moments were honestly baffling, too, such as how he switches from being completely mind-broken during the events of the fifteenth episode to being totally normal (albeit with a desire for revenge) in the next. \\n\\n\r\nI say all this, but the eighteenth episode is actually one of the best episodes of anime I have seen in quite some time. \\n\\n\r\nLet me explain. \\n\\n\r\nWhere the first two thirds of the anime spent its time showcasing unnecessary gore, Subaru's stupidity and empty characters who exist for little more than space on hug pillows and other creepy merchandise, the eighteenth episode redeems the anime and gives meaning to all that has happened, even if it doesn't erase its mistakes. It is an episode dedicated entirely to characterisation. It is a single conversation where Subaru shows remorse for his actions, recognising all the mistakes he has made and why he kept making them. He understands that he is a deeply flawed, broken person incapable of saving anyone or indeed even himself. It is at this moment that Subaru becomes aware of who he is. And you know what? I stopped hating him as a result, even if I still fundamentally disagreed with his actions and his character. He showed himself to be a human being for the first time in the entire story.\\n\\n\r\nI have great respect for scenes such as these. It's not often we get entire episodes dedicated to something as ordinary as a conversation. Re:Zero didn't need to use gore and death to identify its characters or make us care - it did so merely by giving Subaru a stage to speak. This leaves just one question: why didn't Re:Zero do this from the very beginning? \\n\\n\r\nIt's a bummer, as there was actually potential for a great anime. The pieces were there, and the writer and the staff behind the anime demonstrated that they had the talent to execute things in an effective and honest way. The music is excellent, complimenting Subaru's struggles without ever going overboard in sappy piano pieces and cacophonous orchestral pieces as many shows of its type tend to. Its visuals look totally fine, maintaining a consistent quality despite the longer-than-average episode count and abundant battle scenes, while the facial expressions, if occasionally a bit excessive, are undeniably effective at demonstrating the characters' pain and anguish. Re:Zero is very much a well-produced anime; you can tell that the people at White Fox truly wanted to create something special. \\n\\n\r\nI think this is why, even if I was bothered by most of the things I witnessed during my viewing of Re:Zero, I don't think it is a truly awful anime. It may not be a good one, not by any means-- its mistakes cannot be so easily erased-- but I do think its consistent effort and its eighteenth episode do at least redeem it to the extent of being a passable anime. It's why you see me giving Re:Zero a mediocre rating in my review rather than a poor one. I dislike much about Re:Zero, but for that one episode, I was a fan. \\n\\n\r\nI have a feeling I am in the minority here, as opinions on Re:Zero almost seem to be split into a dichotomy.  It is the best anime ever made for some, a life-changing adventure packed with emotion, and for the rest, it is a pile of irredeemable refuse aimed at the lowest-common denominator. To be perfectly fair, I am far more critical of Re:Zero than I am supportive of it. Its issues are certainly more numerous than its good points, and having one great episode can only take things so far when the other twenty-four vary from terrible to merely OK. But I'll be damned if I said it wasn't worth putting up with all the nonsense to get to that one point in the story. I just don't know if others are nearly as patient as I am, and I do have my doubts that future material will ever come close to that level of quality again.\\n\\n\r\nChances are, you'll have a better time with Re:Zero than I did. Many anime fans aren't looking for anything especially profound or complex in their entertainment, and I do not say that to be arrogant or dismissive. It is perfectly valid to watch anime for its entertainment value-- I do it as well, and so does just about anyone who is honest with themselves. \\n\\n\r\nBut this is a review and not a fan-piece. I am here to share my opinions and to judge the anime with a critical, yet fair eye. Re:Zero has a great deal of issues when viewed under these lenses, and none of them are insignificant. No matter how emotional its copious amounts of death and suffering made you, it would be quite hard to argue there is much more value to Re:Zero than its spectacle. It is a master at manipulating the audience's feelings, and while it succeeds at entertainment and has one special little moment, Re:Zero fails at making the case that it is anything more than lavishly produced, yet cheap theatre.\\n\\n\r\nThe question is, is that enough for you?\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't enough for me.",

            "content": "*This review contains light spoilers*\r\nFrom my perspective, we are living in a time where well crafted anime with a myriad of originality and detail are unfortunately being released at a frequently declining rate. Because of this, many in the anime community are constantly on the lookout for something new and creative. So naturally, when an anime like Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu airs, a show that boasts morbidly unique twists on the popular but overused fantasy/game world genre, it gains a lot of popularity and is generally well received in the anime community. However just because something is innovative doesn't mean that it is agood show overall. No, there are other characteristics, such as a detailed plot and a well developed cast, that can elevate a show from being simply different to something great. So is Re:Zero a great anime? I honestly believe that it is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd not just because there's a totally badass adorable maid in it who fulfills the desires of every man's heart (besides the romantically challenged main character who blatantly rejects her feelings for him. What a heartless monster).\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI never thought that any anime would be able to effectively combine dark psychological elements with an upbeat fantasy setting. However the genius behind Re:Zero, Tappei Nagatsuki, was able to expertly mix the two seemingly incompatible genres together, and the results are quite impressive. The show begins with our protagonist Natsuki Subaru getting suddenly transported to a fantasy world after leaving a convenience store. Being an otaku who has probably dreamed about something like this happening to him for years, Subaru is naturally excited to be in this new world. However, to his dismay, Subaru quickly learns that he doesn't have any special abilities or powers. Or so he thinks...anyway, he encounters the beautiful half elf Emilia when she saves him from a group of thugs. Thus the two of them start their adventure. This beginning seems quite clich\u00e9d, however everything changes dramatically when Subaru soon finds himself dead.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that was unexpected. The protagonist dies before the first episode even ends? Really? Well we soon learn that Subaru actually does possess a magical ability, called return from death. However this power only works when Subaru dies. When this skill activates, Subaru essentially travels back in time to a certain checkpoint to relive that part of his life in order to change it to a future in which he successfully completes a certain objective and lives. Being a fan of shows involving time traveling, I was excited to see where Nagatsuki was going with this, and I wasn't disappointed with the result.\\n\\n\r\nI was initially worried that Re:Zero would end up getting boring with the protagonist constantly failing and traveling back in time to relive the exact same scenarios over and over again. However with each new life, the progression of the story alters, sometimes dramatically, and many new elements are revealed to Subaru which were previously unknown that help him to solve the problems he faces and move on. This kept the anime fresh and exciting since something different happened with each life. Also, with every passing arc, Subaru's situation seemed to become substantially more dire, which lead to an increased intensity in the anime that kept me constantly entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOne negative aspect of the show that I've noticed is that Re:Zero seems to rely and focus on Subaru's ability a bit too heavily. This consistent emphasis on return from death takes away from other things, such as the detail revolving around the royal selection. This is seemingly an important plot point, but it is significantly overshadowed by the constant focus on Subaru and his continuous retakes at life. The anime spends an episode or two describing the royal selection and emphasizing its importance in relation to the characters only to practically drop it and hardly mention anything about it throughout the rest of the anime. There are some other similar occurrences present in Re:Zero as well. This resulted in the loss of plot points that could have made the anime more well rounded.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are very lovely. They are usually rather detailed, especially their facial expressions and features during moments when their faces are zoomed in on. Vibrant colors also help to bring the characters and scenery to life. Unfortunately, like many other shows in the industry, the animation dipped in quality as the anime progressed. The most notable example would be the fight scenes. Those showcased in the anime's initial episodes were highly detailed and well executed. However some of the later battles seemed more sloppy and not as well animated. Also, the CGI used on some background characters was utterly appalling. Luckily the use of CGI is very limited in this show. But hey, at least the female characters still maintained their lovely features throughout the entirety of the anime, and that's what really counts, right?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI was excited when I learned that Konomi Suzuki and Myth&Roid would be performing the theme songs for this anime since I enjoy music produced by both of them. Overall, I think that the theme songs are rather good, with my personal favorite being the first ending, Styx Helix, by Myth&Roid. The soundtrack was successful; it played upbeat and relaxing songs during lighthearted scenes and transitioned to dark and distorted themes during psychological moments. Subaru's seiyuu, Kobayashi Yuusuke, does an excellent job at vocally expressing the character's utter pain and misery through his voice acting talents.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, many of the characters in Re:Zero appear to fall into generic character categories. However as the anime progresses, the cast seems to evolve from their seemingly average state into much more dynamic, unique, and sometimes even lovable characters. \\n\\n\r\nSubaru surprisingly isn't some overpowered MC who can unexplainably beat every other character at practically everything. In fact, his only ability worth noting is return from death, which, while being extremely useful since it gives Subaru multiple chances at life, is the main source of his psychological trauma. Although he initially acts positive, Subaru slowly cracks and falls further into despair and insanity as the anime progresses. He is one of the few characters I've seen that, for the most part, actually acts like a real life human would in the dark situations that he finds himself in. Of course, this may mean that you'll want to punch him in the face sometimes when he acts all cowardly, stupid, and obnoxious, but you have to understand what the poor guy is going through. Plus he redeems himself in the later portion of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEmilia is a beautiful, kind, and lovable girl; in other words, the type that many view as great waifu material. However the thing that I like most about her is the fact that she, unlike so many other female characters like her, can actually live WITHOUT the male lead. During one point she actually decides that it's best for her and Subaru to go there separate ways. I find this to be rather admirable, since it shows that Emilia can be an independent person who doesn't need to rely on others. There's not much else to say about her since she hardly gets any screen time in the second half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nRem surprised me the most out of all of the characters. In fact, I believe that she's much more developed than the \"main girl,\" Emilia, and is simply a superior character. The first few times that we see Rem, she humorously makes fun of Subaru with the assistance of her sister Ram. However as the story progresses, we get to learn so much more about Rem. I don't want to spoil any particular moments, but I will say that she has a badass yandere mode where she slaughters practically everything with her spiked mace in an epic fashion. Rem also develops feelings for Subaru, who she becomes admirably loyal to and saves numerous times, that lead to some really adorable moments between the two. Rem is also super cute and she just looks stunning, especially when she smiles. The sexy maid outfit is also a plus. Re:Zero really showcases a rare gem in Rem, who is the best anime character that I've seen in awhile.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero also boasts a strong supporting cast. This group of characters includes the cute and sarcastic maid Ram, the adorable and magical loli Beatrice, and the utterly insane and slothful antagonist Petelgeuse. While obviously not as much as the lead cast, many of these characters receive adequate development and possess unique personality traits that make them more likable and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show combines the best aspects of different genres to create something that is very entertaining to watch. It has fun characters and settings that kept me entertained. I was constantly on the edge of my seat in excitement hoping for Subaru to succeed and tensely waiting to see the repercussions of his failures. Cliffhangers were effectively used at the end of multiple episodes that left me craving more, though they were a bit excessive. While some episodes focused on dialogue and lacked any \"excitement,\" I still enjoyed watching them because they helped to flesh out the characters and gave me valuable insight on the characters' emotions, thoughts, etcetera. My main issue is that I feel like the anime peeked at around episode 15, and while the latter half of Re:Zero remained pretty good, it didn't quite reach the level of greatness that the mid episodes had. Nonetheless, this was definitely an entertaining anime from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6/10\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero impressed me. This anime wasn't afraid to take an overused idea and combine it with a myriad of originality that resulted in a very well produced show. While there are some minor errors (then again, what show doesn't have any flaws?), Re:zero managed to succeed at being both an unique and a well executed anime. This is a show that I would most certainly recommend watching.",

            "content": "\"The only thing worse than dying once is having to die again.\"\r\nThat was the title of a wonderful email from Crunchyroll I received about a month and a half ago to advertise \"Re: Zero - Starting Life in another World -\". I ignored it at first, and simply carried on with my two shows of the season, Jojo Part 4 and Mob Psycho 100 (both of which I heartily recommend you watch). However, after a little while of my friends pestering me to watch this series, I sat down and put the first half of the first episode onto my TV.\r\nRe: Zero starts off somewhatstereotypically. A somewhat clueless teenager is mysteriously dragged into a parallel world through means unexplained whilst browsing a convenience store. My initial thoughts were similar to that of Sword Art Online, which made me immediately assume that this series may go in the same direction, with pointless character arcs and questionable writing.\\n\\n\r\nOh my was I completely wrong.\\n\\n\r\nOur main lead is the endearing Natsuki Subaru, a teenage shut-in with initially very little character. Upon arriving in this new world, he comes to meet the silver-haired girl \"Satella\", who claims she is looking for something she recently had stolen from her. After Subaru agrees to help her, they wind up at the city slums... Where they are both brutally murdered.\\n\\n\r\nIt is at this point, Subaru returns back where he started. Initially believing he dreamt up the scenario, he runs back towards the slums to meet with Satella, where after certain events... He is murdered again.\\n\\n\r\nHere is where Re: Zero starts to really shine. Subaru has the power to, as he names it, \"Return by Death\", where upon dying he returns back to a previous point in his time where he is safe to try things over again. Everyone he met during his last \"life\" forgets him, and only what he has achieved before he \"resets\" remains. However, Subaru remembers. He remembers all the times he's been killed, everything he may have experienced and everything that everyone he's met has no memory of.\\n\\n\r\nRe: Zero looks in-depth at the effect this has on his mental state, which can lead it into the realms of being a psychological thriller. And it achieves representing Subaru's mind absolutely perfectly, in such a way that it's hard to sum up in words. The viewer feels everything Subaru feels, his shock and awe, his confusion, his sudden realisations, as well as his happiness when eventually, everything turns out just OK.\\n\\n\r\nThe show presents Subaru as more than anything else, being very human. He reacts to situations in a way you'd expect, and to some viewers, in that way that they would. That's not to say Subaru is the only character that gets developed. Other characters that are met later in the story have their own short arcs that link in with their backstory, even if it's one moreso than any of the others.\\n\\n\r\nRe: Zero absolutely nails it's presentation of each episode. Each episode flows naturally, sometimes not including the show's OP and ED for extra effect (which on a side note helps to make the show very nice to marathon). Each episode ends with a \"title screen\" as such, of the episode's title, and why this may not seem like a big deal, it's small things like this that help to keep the show's atmosphere working, whether it's a happy sigh of relief, or a grim potential future rearing its head.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has two Openings and two Endings, all of which work well with the arc they air in. The first OP \"Redo\" by Konomi Suzuki is a visual spectacle, with flashy effects and hidden meanings that become more obvious as the show continues, all while giving a good grasp on what exactly Re: Zero may contain for people going in with no prior knowledge of the show's events. The second OP, \"Paradisus - Paradoxum\" by MYTH&ROID, while not as visually stunning as the first OP, has a chaotic nature to it that perfectly captures the feel of the arc it airs in. The first ED, \"STYX HELIX\", also by MYTH&ROID works well when played during an ending scene, however has little effect for the viewer when played by itself (though it's still a great song). The final ED, \"Stay Alive\" is performed by Rei Takahashi, the VA for \"Satella\", and like the ED before it, works far better when played during an ending scene. The show's two insert songs, \"STRAIGHT BET\" and \"theater D\" (both my MYTH&ROID) both work FABULOUSLY with the scenes they play in for bonus points.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is anywhere to fault the show, it is on it's character development \"priorities\" so to speak. A few of the side characters introduced appear to be getting developed at some stages, however never seem to get the equal treatment that some of the other side characters do. Aside from this, at times the character animation can seem somewhat sloppy, however thankfully this is very rare and never during prominent moments.\\n\\n\r\nTo end things off, Re: Zero - Starting Life in another World - is very much a spectacle - one that will keep you on your toes, make you smile, make you cry in despair and most certainly, one not to miss. Special mention for the show's main villain, who while being animated perfectly for his kind of character, also has an undoubtedly wonderful VA (that being the wonderful voice of Yoshitsugu Matsoka) who really nails the \"insane\" feel around the character.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.4/10\\n\r\nArt: 8.4/10\\n\r\nSound: 9.8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Re: Zero a rating of 9.8 out of 10, with my own guideline of to watch it immediately if you haven't already. The series is available for legal streaming on Crunchyroll.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a series that likes to play with your heart and mind like a fiddle, this may be the perfect series for you. Enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWOAH, EDIT TIME!\\n\r\nHey, this review's kinda on the old side now, and while I don't think R:Z is a perfect 10/10 show now, it's still a very solid watch for those that love Isekai or anime with darker themes.",

            "content": "Hi all, this is my first review on MAL. Please bare with me, but I feel like I should share my opinion on this and why I gave it the score I did. I wouldn't say I'm the most hardcore anime fan, but I have definitely seen my fair share of shows and am pretty much a typical anime viewer. I review anime in my mind pretty differently than others. Note, there may be a lot of extra information that is unneeded for this review, but I really want to put my perspective on this as much as possible. If you don't care, just scrolldown to the three hyphens.\\n\\n\r\nJust to get things out of the way: this score deserves a 10 not necessarily for its metrics per se, but for the fact that for people who like anime in general it is a show that needs to be seen.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm sick and tired of lately, which will probably never be stopped, is reviewers or fans comparing shows to other shows. It's a huge anime circlejerk that people are really adamant about. Honestly, it could be said about a lot of things. Video games are a very good example, but that's for another time.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start off with my initial reaction. I usually pick a few shows to watch each season and continue from there. When I watched the trailer, I was immediately reminded of KonoSuba. It wasn't off putting, but I was just surprised to see an almost identical setting so soon. Of course, people are using 'isekai' as a description, but I never really heard of that until recently. Where a character gets transported into a world, etc...\\n\\n\r\nI ended up only watching the first half of the hour long opening due to time constraints and it was kind of a \"whatever\" show to me. Big mistake. I took this for granted and ended up with friends on social media blabbering about the show weeks later. Around episode 14 or so.\\n\\n\r\nI asked one of my good friends, who I'd actually say is pretty hardcore into anime (he's been using MAL for years and has a very strict rating guideline and watches almost every show that releases), what the concept of the show was. Remember, I didn't bother to look into this show at all. He basically just told me what happened at the end of the second half of the season premiere and I totally regretted my decision that night. I'm a sucker for that device- being able to start again or go into the past. I may have a bias on that genre (please don't look at my favorite shows... :) ), but this show executes it very well. I ended up binge watching until 15 and it was totally worth it. Since then, I've been trying to make the first thing I do every Sunday morning is watch Re:Zero.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBeginning with the story; it is wide and vast, but at its core a very deep, and emotional heart string puller. I'll say it here: I read a bit of the web novel a few weeks ago because my mind could not wait. I do like to spoil myself sometimes, but that's exactly what this show made me do. I did the same with Erased, and Shingeki no Kyojin. Why? Because there was so much information I wanted to know that I feel like the show could not explain with a few episodes left. And albeit it is disheartening that they exclude some crucial information regarding characters or story, it does not take it away from the show at all. That's why I said it is wide and vast.\\n\\n\r\nAt initial glance, it seems as a very typical \"otaku/neet character gets transported into a different world...\" (as mentioned earlier), but it gives it a twist with strong character development along the way, which I will explain later. Being able to \"start again from zero\" is a common trend recently, but I honestly will never get tired of it. We all wish to be able to time travel or start things over, and it fills my need by watching these shows. This executes the concept incredibly well. It's hard to talk about the story without the characters, because they really are the backbone than the story rather than the lore of the world. \\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist is Natsuki Subaru, and it's very much his story. I hate him. I hate him a lot. Many people actually do, but it's not a bad thing. Why do we hate him? Because he makes horrible decisions and does things we do not want, at all. He is...very real. Many viewers and other anime fans like characters who have crazy magic powers, look super cool, wields some badass sort, or something along those lines.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing special about Subaru. He's definitely no Sora from No Game No Life. He also didn't have the luxury Kazuma Satou (KonoSuba) had being able take Aqua with him and join a guild/get a job.\\n\\n\r\nWe hate this guy. He's a crybaby and practically useless. However, that is what drives this show. We get to see him evolve into a better person. He treats his adventure like a game, and gets punished for it. We realize the struggle he goes through, and that is what we would go through if we were transported into a world like that. We play it off like a game that we see or know, but it's not a game, it's very real.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru doesn't start off as some overpowered character that can trump the bad guys or continuously one-up them. He literally dies- over and over again. And he still doesn't learn his lesson until he deals with love. The love for Emilia. When it gets that deep, we're already attached. He'll do anything for her, and makes us feel the same way. Also, he doesn't automatically attract this \"harem\" that people seem to think he has. He earns it. He gave up blood and sanity to learn these people and they became a part of his life in this world.\\n\\n\r\nFor 25 episodes, we don't see the finish line straight ahead, but we wish we could see the course from above. Obstacles have been overcome, but there are a more to come, and some block in the roads as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are many characters to love in this show, hell, Rem is already tons of people's waifu. What makes her that though? Her personality and determination is what all of us want, but not Subaru. She is everything to him, yet he stays faithful to Emilia. A lot of fans also have this as a reason to hate him; rejecting the perfect girl for someone who doesn't even feel the same way for him.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the fun if everything went the way you wanted? Of course- that's what we want in our heads, but not doing what we want creates tension, which is completely fine for this kind of genre. The last thing you want to think about is that it is a silly harem/comedy. It really isn't. It has twists, turns, loops, you shouldn't be wanting something, you should be wanting to know what direction is coming ahead.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the cast in general. It's great, just like I rated it. It's hard to find a perfect set, but they're close to being one. Everyone that gets air time, for the most part, has a developed background and importance in the show. They all mesh well together and have some sort of connection to Subaru. Characters that simply might be thought of \"side characters\", may have more than a meaning than you think. The feeling this show makes when Subaru gets so close to someone and have them dying off, and seeing them in a different timeline alive again is eerie as hell. You feel the realization that they were just dead- you became really close to them, and now you are back at the point where you just met them. There are some characters who get a decent amount, but are still unexplained in the show, but will be eventually...hopefully.\\n\\n\r\nYou want to look through the eyes of Subaru when looking at the cast, since this is his story. There are people you are going to hate and it's perfectly acceptable, because Subaru hates them as well. The same goes for being attached. That's why this is such a great cast. And People hating Subaru? That is fine too, because he shows that he truly hates himself throughout the entirety of the show. He wants to do better and you want him to do better, but keeps doing worse, and worse. He then realizes his faults, and so do we. When he develops, we develop.\\n\\n\r\nPeople would say, why wouldn't he just do or say this? We need to realize that he portrays a neet or otaku and thinks it's a game. He thinks he can get away with what he knows about that culture, but is completely wrong. His method and thinking is not the same as ours watching. Being there is entirely different and that's the way he went through with it. He thinks he's Kirito, but obviously he's just a random neet stuck in a fantasy world. He doesn't have good social skills. He's awkward and cringey.\\n\\n\r\nBut his willingness to learn and his determination he promised since episode 1 is what makes him strong. He does get it over his head, way over his head, but he learns and realizes his mistakes, which makes him an amazing character. Not many characters these days accept their faults and mistakes. They're just already the best person in the universe and can overcome anything. We see why Subaru is able to do that in the end.\\n\\n\r\nI can go over the other main characters or lead support characters just as much as Subaru, but I'm just going to shorten it here and say that Emilia is the X-Factor of the show. She pretty much preemptively decided Subaru's fate. I mean, she IS the main female protagonist. Rem and Ram help build his character, and I say this in the least descriptive way possible to keep this review shorter so I don't bore you with reading. They are the main support characters. And to make it generic, they support him pretty damn well.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, they beat him up (both mentally and physically), but he learns and builds from it. Every character he has a moment with is important to him. He learns to use his past knowledge about people to help him get through the world. They're not just people to him. As mentioned, at first, he completely naive, and we hate it, but we should stay in our seat and watch as his flaws become traits.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNo need to get into too much detail about this. The design and visuals great, but the random CG background characters really take it away from me to be honest. Like especially when there are drawn background characters mixed in with CG background characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs aren't anything to be in awe about. I mean, Subaru is in a track suit for Christ's sake. Emilia's outfit is cute, Rem and Ram are just in kind of skimpy maid outfits. I do like the outfits the knights have.\\n\\n\r\nThe settings and locations are incredible though, like the city, mansion, forest, and open fields. Great variety colors. I'm not too keen on art, but in the end, it's all great except the super obvious CG.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe background, fighting, and setting music aren't really memorable to me, but they're not bad whatsoever. There wasn't a time where I felt as if the music was off or anything, so it was just fitting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the openings and endings I really enjoyed. At first I thought the second opening song was a little odd, but it really grew on me and I actually ended up wanting to watch the opening every time it came on, so that's good new. Myth & Roid is cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ending is fantastic. Like, when the episode would end and that song would play without the actual ending being played. It's kind of a slow and sad sounding song, so during intense moments it really brought out my emotions even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, oh let me get started on the voice acting. So there's this bad guy named Petelgeuse/Betelgeuse. Just look up some clip and try to guess who the voice actor without looking him up.\\n\\n\r\n-Yeah, it's Matsuoka. The guy who voices Sora, Soma, and Kirito. He does an AMAZING job differentiating his normal tone and voice. Even Subaru's voice actor does a breathtaking job. You can feel the anger, angst, and struggle with his voice. He's portraying an insane villain and has some crazy lines and phrases that are unforgettable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nUh, maybe by this review and its score you can tell if I enjoyed it or not. :) I binged this show like 15 episodes straight and was wanting more every week. I could probably say I enjoyed it, a little. It's a ride that I want to keep staying on. Ups, downs, loops, turns, jumps, you name it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWith the individual scores, it comes to about a 95%, which I rounded up to a 10/10. So in actuality, this show is a 9.5. Absolutely nothing wrong with that.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the only thing I would have to say is that I'd only recommend this show for people who have already watched a few shows already. I wouldn't say it's a good first show to watch if you're just new into anime, as good as it is. You kind of need to have background knowledge of other shows. Even though I say not to compare, but to just be aware and see the difference it really has to other shows, or that it takes in different aspects and genres to create this wonderful show.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys.",

            "content": "Ahh, the reviewer. The first line of defense to quell the flames of irrational thought and often the bearer of bad news for those of the general public. They're the Buzz Killingtons that take it upon themselves to blow the \"no fun\" whistle and send the partygoers back on the hype-train that they rode in on. It's a thankless job, one that doesn't reward anyone besides the smug satisfaction of the man with the whistle, tipping his top hat and waving \"adieu\" at the fanbase, outraged that someone had the audacity to bring an analytical lens to the \"totally bitchin party, bruh!\"\r\nAnd as the seasonallineup ends and the hype-train chugs on to the next destination to start the cycle all over again, the reviewer, Mr. Buzz Killington, slaps his final verdict in the form of a nasty wall of diatribes, as he carries on his endless crusade to educate would-be viewers, one party foul at a time. \\n\\n\r\nNow, before I go any further, I'd like to put all my chips on the table. I don't plan to campaign for Re:Zero's public standing, nor will I bastardize its name for the sake of winning the appeal of dissenters. What will be written from here on out is simply one man stating his viewpoint. If that means dispensing the full-range of my vocabulary like a snobby know-it-all, then so be it. As long as my assessment is clearly understood, whether you choose to sling mud at my remarks or practice diplomacy is of no concern to me. \\n\\n\r\nAnd without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, weeaboos and pseudo-elites, I, ZephSilver, will serve as your Buzz Killington for the evening, as we take a tour through anime's latest mistake, Re:Zero, or as I like to call it, Re:packaged goods. \\n\\n\r\nWrithing in pain it doesn't understand, with paint-by-number personalities that desperately try to express it, Re:Zero is a gaudy, yet entertaining, blowhard that stumbles upon an ingenious formula for mainstream success. In a cynically calculated ruse, Re:Zero combines snippets of set-pieces from other works to create a Frankenstein that's built to be a surefire hit, regardless of how much manipulation is required to keep the circus act up. By capitalizing on the ever-increasing demand for MMORPG inspired settings, time-travel narratives and well... a gratuitous amount of shock value, it captures the general populace's attention with ease. And really, who could fault it? The anime industry has within its grasp a foolproof method to gain the public's ear. A method that's figured out, down to a science, thanks to countless trial and error. It just so happens that this 'foolproof' method is predicated on sales and popularity, whether it receives critical acclaim or not is secondary. Dangling its bait right after the success of works with similar setups, it was inevitable that many would bite. Re:Zero offered many fan-favorite arrangements all in a convenient, one-stop package: a smorgasbord of goodies to satisfy a wide range of palates. And if that wasn't enough to seal the deal, it marketed a premise that potentially subverted the MMORPG formula into something dark and decrepit, capturing any stragglers that might have avoided the bait in disinterest with the promise of something \"re:freshing.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe rest was simply a matter of word of mouth. The match was lit, and all that was left was to sit back and watch the wildfire burn. With viewers exalting Re:Zero as \"smart,\" \"bold,\" and \"enthralling,\" ignoring this show's existence became nigh impossible. An anime that was built to be popular. An anime that was predestined to become the centerpiece discussion of every anime-related thread during its run. A wonderful monstrosity concocted in a lab by a board of executives, perfecting their latest endeavor to siphon money out of people's pockets, without so much as making the intent noticeable. I know we all want to hold an optimistic view on this situation but I advise that we take a step back before purchasing the snake oil. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is to White Fox what Kabaneri was to Wit studio: a proven investment, disingenuous or not. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, think about it for a moment. What were White Fox's most successful outings so far? Akame Ga Kill, a show about gruesome deaths in a medieval fantasy world, riddled with the underpinnings of political intrigue, a setup that deviated from typical shounen fodder, and a broad range of colorful personalities that inhabited its universe. And Steins;Gate, a show about time-travel being used to save your loved ones after a conspiracy was discovered, forcing the protagonist to revisit key events to find the best path to save everyone. Putting aside how you may feel about those shows individually, the fact remains that Re:Zero meshes these two appeals in a fashion that seems far too perfect to be simply a case of coincidence.\\n\r\nWhen you look back at the shows that garnered the most attention in the last handful of years, how could you not feel that Re:Zero is a product of the machine? There's being at the right place at the right time, and then there's simply casting your fishing line after analytical charts and focus groups indicate that the waters are ripe with hungry prey.\\n\\n\r\nSo after stating all this, it may surprise you to know that I fully recommend this show to anyone that confronts me about it. Why may you ask? Well, to be honest, it's pretty entertaining. Whatever my stance may be regarding the title, it cannot be denied that the show is easily digestible. With plot twists at every turn, bloody fatalities being dished out at a moments notice, and cliffhangers guaranteeing your return for more, Re:Zero is a binge-worthy viewing experience. However, my reasons for full-heartedly endorsing the show are probably not the reasons that the creators would probably like. For now, just hold on to that thought, we'll discuss why later.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that long-winded preface out of the way, it's time to continue our tour. \\n\\n\r\nStepping out of a convenience store in modern day Japan and being transported to a medieval fantasy world for no more reason than the writers saying, \"We need to start the story somehow,\" our main protagonist, Suburu, enters Capital City; the epicenter of commerce for this foreign land of Lugunica and the place that would mark his burial ground on several occasions to come. After he comes in contact with a mysterious silver-haired girl named Emilia, he finds himself caught up in a web of deceit, hidden mysteries behind every corner and a bad case of groundhogs day that's marked with the end of his life. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so goes the rest of his journey, constantly being respawned at key locations similar to game save checkpoints until he conquers a life-threatening obstacle. Death, birth, repeat. A rat churning cream to avoid drowning and hoping its efforts would create butter, allowing for solid ground to escape its entrapment. Some might refer to this as \"torture porn\" or a snuff film in animated form. And while I might find these sentiments to be a bit overstated, I still can't help but feel like there's an underlying truth to that way of thinking. \\n\r\nThere's always a feeling that gnaws away at your subconscious when you watch the show. Something that many viewers may not be able to pinpoint but that they know is there, like the nuisance of a small object stuck in the sole of your shoe or a lingering thought that's just out of reach. I believe this feeling derives from the way the show presents its ideas. Themes that are supposed to be profound but end up taking on a whole new meaning when highlighted in neon lights and announced over a loudspeaker. \\n\\n\r\nSuburu doesn't just die; he's butchered in the most gratuitous way imaginable. A newly gained tactical advantage isn't just implemented; instead, it's buffered through excessive expository dialogue. Character arcs don't just happen naturally; they're highlighted with drastic presentation changes and streams of confetti. In the words of Urban Dictionary, Re:Zero has no chill. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero falls victim to sensationalizing things that it thinks would be considered poignant, as is the case with most shows that are said to 'subvert' the formula they're a part of. And by doing so, it indirectly counteracts that notion. A narcissistic protagonist being humbled by the realization that life doesn't revolve around him isn't a great revelation if the show goes out of its way to constantly point it out. Being mentally exhausted from the toll of dying constantly isn't eye-opening if the show literally has to tell you it is. Subtext ceases to hold meaning if the creators have a habit of making its intent obvious. This is the problem that many high-strung shows have, where they don't trust the viewer to pick up on the clues themselves. 2001: A Space Odyssey wouldn't be praised as a sci-fi classic if it had its ideas being pointed out with Blue's Clues paw prints. Se7en wouldn't be a great mystery/thriller had Dora the Explorer show up as a movie guide. Point being, good subtextual content is only good if the creators don't over-extend their control over how easy it's discovered. \\n\\n\r\nLike Erased from winter 2016, Re:Zero's attempts at something far beyond it only backfires when this issue plagues every facet of its existence. It's trying to be symbolic; it's trying to interweave motifs; it's trying to create intrigue; it's trying to tinker with psychology... but, it's doing so in the most ham-fisted way possible. It fully rejects the idea of subtlety in every aspect imaginable, instead choosing to holler everything in an ostentatious display that's borderline masturbatory. A premature celebration of its accomplishments that's mired in the stench of hubris. \\n\\n\r\nSetting tone and forcing tone aren't the same things. You can't give birth to natural reactions by simply pumping your content full of steroids to make it blossom faster. Anything worth having should come to fruition on its own merits through the course of the narrative. Re:Zero is simply too impatient for proper grooming, and as a result, we get villains that are essentially godforsaken hybrids of the Joker, Batman V Superman's Lex Luther, and the wacky waving inflatable tube men located outside of used car dealerships, snacking on their fingers like crispy chicken tenders. We get characters that deviate from common anime tropes to simply fall victim to yet another trope instead. Re:Zero's biggest enemy is itself, a show that can't be subdued even if it comes at the cost of its own integrity. \\n\r\nBut what about the people that don't see these issues? What about those who are genuinely enthralled by Re:Zero's efforts? Those who, despite the obvious blare of \u2018trying-too-hard\u2019 fireworks, don't pick up on the show's underlying meaning until further inspection? What about the people who push the agenda of the show being \"smart,\" \"bold,\" and \"enthralling?\" The foot soldiers that perpetuate the show's self-worth, finding depth where others see beyond it? Surely they're not mistaken. What do they see that others don't? As it turns out, the real question isn't what they see, but what they choose to give the show credit for. \\n\\n\r\nIt's the interesting themes that Re:Zero flirts with throughout its narrative. The outer shell that masquerades as in-depth concepts. If there's no prior contact with the ideas that Re:Zero presents, this kind of perception is easy to understand. First exposure to something that insinuates a deeper layer could cause any viewer to wax philosophical. And there lies the difference: those that have seen the laminated copy, as well as the genuine article. When the same concepts are seen done right, suddenly that laminated copy starts to become all the more noticeable. And so is the case with Suburu's supposedly \"broken psyche.\"\\n\\n\r\nLike the case for Gakkougurashi of summer 2015, another show proclaimed as a 'deconstruction' of its genre, Re:Zero also takes pleasure in tinkering with delirium, but refuses to dive truly into it. It glorifies the main character's mental breakdown, turning it on and off at the whims of the scriptwriters. With something as easy as a pep talk and hug from LoveInterest#2 being all that's needed to make things better, it's really hard to justify the \"psychology\" that Re:Zero boasts about.\\n\\n\r\nWant to truly show a mentally broken state? Then have the line between past existence and current life be obscured with each reincarnation, and don't fix it. Just imagine how amazing it would be if the memories of all respawned events were compressed upon each rebirth, to the point where Suburu is no longer aware of the difference between them. It would truly demonstrate the anguish that Suburu suffers through by making the consequence something that's not only visual for the viewer but also something that implies that deeper layer that the show so desperately seeks to obtain. Instead of simply being the laminated copy, it could have been like other animated works that truly dive deep into this concept, such as Satoshi Kon's Millennium Actress and Perfect Blue. Both featured films containing women who slowly lose their minds and grips on reality as they descend further into a fever dream of delirium and jumbled memory. It didn't just carry around psychology like some fashion accessory, but it made it a very real thing for the viewers looking on and the characters that took the plunge into the never-ending spiral of irrational flatlining. \\n\r\nSee that the protagonist suffers a loss that he can't simply fix with a jump off a cliff. Have stakes. If respawning to checkpoints is the only way to advance the narrative, the very least the creators could do would be to place Suburu at the crossroad of a decision that would allow advancement only if someone else were to perish. Let there be permanent blood on his hands, not just a never-ending clean slate. Don't resolve psychological trauma like it's just some phase people get over after a few days. Don't just wave around psychology like it's a toy. People don't simply undo damage because the plot demands a rational mind in a given scenario. This shouldn't change even for Suburu. Embrace it fully. Let go of safety nets if you truly want something that's \"deep\" and not just another copy of something other creators (Satoshi Kon) have proven is possible to achieve. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really, this is just covering one aspect the show chooses to claim as its own. The same level of commitment is expected for every aspect of Re:Zero, not just some half-assed effort. With these nebulous concepts about redefining a protagonist's importance and exposing inner truths that felt entirely too heady for something as simple-minded as Re:Zero to muster up in any meaningful way, the only chance that the other half that doesn't see the show as \"smart,\" \"bold,\" and \"enthralling\" could buy into it, is if the show stops trying to find compromise that's easy to live with. It may seem \"smart,\" but it does so with an air of smarminess while also over-pronouncing its efforts. It may seem \"bold,\" but it never takes any risks that could be seen as irreversible. It may seem \"enthralling\" for advocates, but for everyone else on the other side of the aisle, it's just dumb schlock-entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if there was anything that made this half-ass commitment more apparent, it would have to be the presentation that it was given. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is that kid that just learned a new 3-syllable word and just spews it out at every opportune moment in a sad attempt to appear intellectual. There're some elements here that demonstrate some semblance of writing chops, I would give the show that, but the way the writers flaunt their ability to come up with said ideas comes off as conceited, especially when these moments wallow in content that's tantamount to idiotic orchestral displays. It's a proud peacock, flaunting its ideas, while strutting around with toilet paper stuck to its ass. As it navel-gazes, everyone else looks on in amusement. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I said it points things out with neon lights, this is what I mean. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cHey, the camera is shaking excessively. Hey, we're giving Suburu a manic expression, one step away from having him foaming at the mouth. Hey, we literally added a 10% darkness opacity filter to Suburu's color scheme. Hey, all of these scene compositions literally bathe Suburu in a constant shadow. Hey, his eyes are big and bulgy. HEY, HEY, HEY!! Do you get it yet!? Hey, are our actions to paint him in an obscure light after a big altercation with Emilia not made clear yet? Please reward us. Please tell us we're smart. I learned a 3-syllable word today! Please applaud my efforts!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nEvil can't be expressed without outlandishly warped expressions. Happiness can't be felt without copious amounts of animated tears, a gust of wind, and painted on blushes. Insanity can't be expressed without darkened eye bags, manic expressions, and rape faces. Everything is calculated. A stage play executed with no blemishes. A play that remains a play. Art that imitates the art of others. Re:Zero wants to be a real boy, but its growing wooden nose tells the truth it doesn't want to admit to itself. If the warped face of anger looks forced, then guess what: it's forced. If the happy moments felt a bit too inflated with random rose peddles flying around and kawaii-level faces, then guess what: it's inflated. If sadness felt unauthentic with instantaneous waterworks and elastic expressions at the drop of a hat, then guess what: it's unauthentic. You're not interpreting it wrong. That pang in the back of your head that tells you this is kinda overkill isn't \"just you.\" Deep down you know what you're seeing is over exaggerated, and after time has settled and you reminisce about key events, that would become clearer than ever. Re:Zero is a novelty act that blinds you with flurries of action and plot twists, but the moments the spectacle is over, what would remain is the realization that what you held dear was nothing more than snake oil sold by a quick-witted businessman. \\n\\n\r\nEven things like auditory cues can't help but feel like the show signaling excessively to get your attention, an example being a high pitched hum, like angelic beings from a choir taking a laxative-laced shit. It could be seen as \"chilling\" to some, or you could be like me and think it's the angels of heaven passing a kidney stone in orchestic unison. Point being it's played only to signal a disturbance. And seeing that the show is all about disturbances, it just ends up exacerbating a problem that didn't need any more highlighting than it was already getting. \\n\\n\r\nWhat needed more attention, however, were the characters and environment that the story took place in. For a show that's supposed to be genre defining, it does very little to prove it. \\n\\n\r\nWe get characters whose defining personality trait is being a loli with a speaking habit, I suppose. Beatrice and the rest of the loli cast could fuck off, I suppose. But I suppose since half of Re:Zero's main cast is lolis, getting rid of them would leave very little, I suppose. Stereotypical roles don't suddenly become better by simply switching them to another stereotypical role. A visual novel maid character doesn't gain depth by making her \u201cwaifu-bait\u201d contestants. And this extends to every other character Suburu comes across on his journey. They're all just there to fill in expected roles, like a bunch of NPCs that are brought to life.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no sense of culture. No ethos to pull from. Nothing that defines the world that Suburu is tossed into. Just snippets of ideas cobbled together to serve as yet another medieval fantasy world that draws from the same well as any other. Were Re:Zero the only anime to tackle high fantasy, this wouldn't be a problem, but sadly for it, Escaflowne exists. Rage of the Bahamut exists. Berserk(1997) exists. Moribito exists. There's nothing here that defines Re:Zero. Even trainwrecks like Akame Ga Kill had a better-thought-out universe. And for whatever it does try to establish, it's either extremely overbearing or missing things that could be attributed to half-assed resolve. To go into specific cases would require spoiling some events, so join me in the spoiler section to go over them if you've already seen the show. As for everyone else, skip past for final thoughts. \\n\\n\r\n**** brief spoilers****\\n\r\n(scroll down to avoid)\\n\\n\r\nNaita Aka Oni (The Red Ogre who Cried), is a popular Japanese children tale that teaches kids the cost of assimilation and what it means for loved ones left behind to gain it. This is shown with a red and a blue ogre. Re:Zero attempted to use this story to insinuate the relationship shared between Ram and Rem. But like everything else that the show highlights unnecessarily, this parallel drawn was also made blatantly obvious, with Ram and Rem's hair color being pink and blue, which obviously alluded to the red and blue ogres, respectively. This wouldn't have been a big deal had they kept it at just that, but like I've already stated, the show doesn't trust its audience to pick up on the subtext implied. Instead, we get the arc with the inclusion of both sisters being superimposed with a symmetrical balance of pink and blue at every turn. It beats you over the head with the symbolism it's trying to present. This also included Suburu stating to the sisters that they're \u201cfanatical like demons\u201d with their reactions indicative to their origin as literal demons. It's this kind of obviousness that shows like Erased demonstrate when they highlighted everything in red to insinuate danger. Attempts at cleverness that's just painfully juvenile. And now this same kind of forcefulness is being carried over to Re:Zero. \\n\\n\r\nAnd 17-minutes into episode 11, Suburu states, \"You know, Rem, you keep putting Ram on a pedestal and undermining yourself\u2014,\" while the camera unapologetically focuses on blue and pink flowers, both literally sitting in a vase (pedestal) of equal height. These are the kinds of things that Re:Zero does repeatedly that demonstrate its lack of restraint. Constantly drawing attention to your symbolism only defeats the purpose of it, to begin with. Symbolism and motifs alike are supposed to be discovered, not spoon-fed. And this is the problem with this show: it can't simply let things be without intervening with forceful resolve. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then you have ideas that are used only to add detail to the universe or serve as a new plot reveal to keep the story exciting, but that are never properly thought out. \\n\\n\r\nLike the battle against Moby Dick, a beast with the ability to erase the memory of people's existence consumed by its fog. We get an example of this when Rem sacrifices herself to save Suburu and is immediately forgotten by everyone who knows her. But yet, when this incident occurs again during the heat of battle against a battalion in episode 20, the powers don't work the same way. Where in the case of Rem her very presence and existence was erased, in this battle, soldiers only forgot the names of the soldiers lost in the mist but are still aware of the fact that people are missing. So how do people remember a whole platoon going missing during battle when they're consumed when prior cases of the whale's mist made it clear that you wouldn't even be aware of the lack of anything missing? This is just one of many small plotting issues littered across the show, and the only conclusion is that the creator needed another plot twist to hook viewers in, but fell victim to a plot hole later on when it no longer served a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nSuburu is said to smell like the witch to a few people, yet, from all accounts, no one has ever encountered the witch face to face, so how do they know this assessment to be accurate? So the statement:\\n\r\n\"Do I smell like the witch?\"\\n\r\nis no better than saying:\\n\r\n\"Do I smell like the thing you've never seen or come in contact with in your life?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe entire show is just built on one unanswered question after another. How did he arrive in this world? How does his respawning ability work like a save point? In episode 24, he was shown to restart after getting past the whale and into the mansion, but then he could conveniently go back to the point where he defeated the whale as a save point after he dies at the village? It's obvious that this was done only to bypass having to reset the progression he made with Rem in episode 18. A moment where the show bends its own rules by going beyond simple retconning, instead, rewriting the very nature in which the resets work. \\n\\n\r\nHow could he speak their language and be understood but not write their assigned text? It's minor things like this that demonstrated that they wanted to appear insightful, but in actuality had only half-baked ideas\u2026 half-baked ideas that gave way to a show riddled with plot inconsistencies. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there're just scenes that are supposed to be tragic but just come across as ludicrous. Episode 15 contains the biggest culprit that comes to mind. This is where we met joker-inflatable-tube-man, who proceeded to break Rem's neck and limbs, and yet, somehow, she crawls over to Suburu and uses magic to free him\u2026 and this is supposed to be tragic? Nothing about this moment makes any sense whatsoever. And to top it off, it also demonstrates a moment where the writers switch Suburu's mental breakdown on and off whenever it suits the story. This isn't some \"deep\" moment; it's bullshit. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero doesn't know the difference between mental anguish and parading characters around for personal amusement, nor does it understand that tossing ideas and lifting entire passages from other folktales don't mean it would work as a cohesive piece. There's a reason there's no cohesiveness between arcs; all it does is pattern storylines from works that proceeded it. A fairy tale whose identity can't exist without leaching off of others, and whose attempts at something different result in the aforementioned problems. \\n\\n\\n\r\n*******end of spoilers*******\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen Hayao Miyazaki said that people \"don't spend time watching real people\" with industry, in-house anime creators being \"humans who can't stand looking at other humans,\u201d this is what he's referring to: shows that can't find inspiration outside of their own anime tropes because the people working on them don't see anything beyond anime. Re:Zero is a self-indulging anime with no worldly influence to speak of. Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, Satoshi Kon, Mamoru Oshii, Yoko Kanno. What made these industry giants well-known was their ability to draw inspiration from influences outside of anime. They brought something new to the table, a claim that shows like Re:Zero can't prove. It's a product of its environment. Anime feeding into anime. It's Ouroboros incarnate. \\n\\n\r\nRemember that thought I told you to hold on to, as to why I still suggest this show, regardless of how I feel about it? Well, this is the reason why. This is what it all boils down to. Re:Zero is an embarrassingly pompous try-hard that's fun to gawk at. It's a show that has proven to be a source of entertainment for those unconcerned with the finer details and who simply want to be amused for 20-minute intervals, as well as a comical mess for those who do see beyond the smoke and mirrors and enjoy dissecting silly shows for purposes of discussion. It's a show that takes itself dead serious while being oblivious to the fact that it's anything but. It's the Elfen Lied, the Mirai Nikki, the Akame Ga Kill, the [insert your own example here] of 2016. A show that could appeal to everyone, regardless of how they view their entertainment or how much thought they place into the pixelated images flooding their peripheral. It's the \"M. Night Shyamalan\" of animated works, a name big enough to fill in seats on opening night, but consistently funny enough for critical thinkers to jump in knowing they'll experience something amusing, even if unintentional.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone wins. The studio heads make their profit; the majority get to be entertained, and the critics get a new punching bag for their inner circles. The world needs titles like Re:Zero. Titles that everyone will see. Cynical cash grabs will always come and go, but if I'm given a choice in the matter, I at least want my price of admission to be a show that's still entertaining. And with Re:Zero, that's what I got, a good ole dumb time. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is a great show if you don't care for subtlety, think 2-D waifus are laifu and are impressed by characters emoting in boisterous ways. But in terms of actual quality, this is an anime that puffs its chest out, holding its breath for as long as it can, with the slightest release exposing it for what it truly is: hot air. \\n\\n\r\nI could count on one hand the number of shows I've ever used the forbidden \"pretentious\" word on without so much as second guessing my stance and I would unequivocally state here and now that Re:Zero became one of them. A show that strong-armed me into using a buzzword that I promised myself I would use only as a final ultimatum. And in a way, I guess that could be seen as an achievement. So congratulations Re:Zero, a show where only the cheapest blow every self-respecting critic dare not to resort to, could be the only appropriate response left available. But in this case, it's worth it. No other shows I've seen in recent years deserve the rare honor more than this. Take the mantle Re:Zero. You\u2019ve officially become the most conceited MMORPG-inspired anime to date.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is spray-on tan psychology with peel-off sticker-tattoo themes. It's the kid on internet forums who are constantly saying \"90's Baby,\" with a 1999 birth certificate. Its out-of-touch executives googling anime-related search results in an attempt to assure their product is \"totally dope.\u201d It's an anime that's rallied in on a stage sponsored by corporate suits, with \"best waifu\" pillows and other merchandise already pre-made upon launch date. Re:Zero is shallow, plain and simple. A skim off the surface of whatever topical events stick their noses out far enough to be noticed by those too busy counting the zeros in their bank account to dig any deeper. \\n\\n\r\nBut you know what? That's fine. I watched it, laughed and had a good time. And if people could cherish the laminated copy with the same vigor that others do the genuine article, who am I to stop them? Shows like Re:Zero will always come and go; you could either fight it or say \"fuck it\" and simply kick back and enjoy the nonsense on screen. \\n",

            "content": "Imagine a show that repackages some of the most recurring themes in anime today and make it into a fantasy thriller. That\u2019s what Re:Zero essentially is. Adapted from the novels of the same name, the show is more of a darker fantasy story than most people may be familiar with. It\u2019s not exactly like a show where a character is stuck in a world and they try to find a way out. Or is it making a parody of the show itself. Rather, Re:Zero (Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu) is a fantasy thriller that has some delirious complexity.\r\nEarly impressions of Re:Zero may trigger viewers\u2019 comparisonto series such Steins;Gate, Erased, or even the live-action movie, Edge of Tomorrow. What do all these have in similarity? It\u2019s the idea of time travel. The ability to loop back from the present to the past is a fictional theme we\u2019ve all heard of before. It\u2019s nothing new and Re:Zero essentially portrays that with Subaru, the main male protagonist and his reset ability. The ability \u201cReturns by Death\u201d allows return to a \u201csave point\u201d after death with all memories intact of the original user. Basically, Subaru gets a chance to fix mistakes so that consequences can be avoided. The key word here is \u2018chance\u2019 as it\u2019s not always guaranteed that Subaru can change the future. By adapting this idea, Re:Zero\u2019s early plot developments shows how Subaru uses his ability to make a difference while trying to live his new life in this unfamiliar world.\\n\\n\r\nFrom that world, we meet a variety of characters. One of the most recognizable character in the show is Emilia, a half-elf who has a mysterious origin. Her identity is similar to another infamous character in the series so others sometimes mistaken her for that. In the meantime, Emilia is a friendly girl although can be commanding and sometimes childish. The relationship between her and Subaru is important as they grow to understand more of each other. One of the important dynamics about their relationship is that Subaru acknowledges her as a good person. This feeling coupled with Emilia\u2019s growing trust of Subaru establishes a bond between the two. Two other characters in the series (Rem and Ram) are also introduced whom Subaru gets acquainted with. In the later stages of the series, Rem shows obvious feelings towards Subaru that grows into love. Similar to Emilia, Subaru acknowledges Rem despite her shady past. And because of that, Rem grows to care Subaru as one of her closest friends.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to really ignore the relationship principles of the show. Subaru forges many important relationships including a contractor, a female knight, and even a guy that once humiliated him in front of everyone. From the get-go, Subaru really isn\u2019t a guy that is afraid to take risks. This sometimes leads to irrational decisions with disastrous consequences but he is also able to learn from his mistakes. In addition, Subaru is an idealist and firmly loyal to those he cares about. He is also clever and uses trickery (possibly from his real life skills) to get what he wants. On paper, Subaru is generally portrayed as a kind man but not afraid to show his tough side either. In essence, Subaru is the most \u201chuman\u201d character in the show. He makes mistakes like humans do and tries to correct them. What I do find irritating about Subaru though is what motivates him for his decisions. This can also lead to other fans of certain characters they\u2019ve grown attached to. Because let\u2019s face it, Subaru has flaws and the writing of the series shows those flaws.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Emilia is a character that I find less appealing. Quite frankly, we just don\u2019t know her enough and it\u2019s hard to understand her in general. Her relationship with Puck and the other characters aren\u2019t fully explored. Furthermore, her personality is hard to get attached to even as they are shown from pieces to pieces. To be honest, the female character that stands out the most in the show would be Rem. She has a background story that is explored including with her twin sister, Ram. The relationship development between her and Subaru is quite memorable as they risk their lives for each other. And furthermore, Rem has her own reasons to help others (in particular Subaru) that viewers will easily understand. Anyway, I think the point I\u2019m trying to make is that between some characters, some just stand out than others. For instance, a breakout character in the show would be Wilheim as we learn in depth of his motivations to fight a giant whale. On the other hand, there are other characters that is just plain replusive such as Petelgeuse from the Witch\u2019s Cult. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the dark fantasy style of Re:Zero, the show still remains lighthearted on many occasions. As a light novel adaptation, you\u2019ll probably find many standard tropes ranging from the generic jealousy of certain girls to childish antics of Beatrice. Subaru also tends to make himself look like a fool in front of others which can be irritating to watch. Still, the comedy of the show on most occasions is properly timed to balance out the darker themes. The fan service comes mostly from violence rather than the skin. In retrospect, Re:Zero deconstructs its fantasy themes and twist them into a darker direction. From an adaptation perspective, the show is faithful to adapt some of the most important elements. However, the series is considered incomplete as there are certain plot elements that are unresolved. The way the director adapted the series seems to focus as much as content from the source as possible while keeping the story credible and on point. \\n\\n\r\nWhite Fox adapts the animation style and Re:Zero is mostly well crafted. The character designs gives the feel like they are from a fantasy world. Characters such as Emilia, Beatrice, the twin sisters, Felt, etc has their own unique presence. The monsters in the series such as the White Whale and Mabeasts also look intimidating. In fact, the Re:Zero world is something you\u2019ll find in any fantasy tale with the lustrous landscapes, dense forests, or medieval-like castles. As you probably know by now, the series has a lot of violence so expect characters such as Petelgeuse and Elsa to showcase that. Most of is censored as White Fox goes out in attempt to make it credible. However, it\u2019s still perfect although I heard the BD/DVD releases will feature more violence.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s also something else that deserves recognition, it would be the soundtrack. The thrilling OST portrays well for a show that has such an eerie feel. The heroic moments and climatic segments are also made memorable with the show\u2019s instrumental choreography. OP and ED theme songs are well crafted with the talent of the singers and producers. In the meantime, I think character voice mannerism also deserves some praise especially for characters like Rem (who can express human emotions quite) and Puck. And while Petelgeuse is quite an unlikeable character, one has to admit that his voice stands out as a villain.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time you\u2019ve finished watching Re:Zero, you\u2019re probably asking yourself if the journey is worth it. The deconstruction of a typical fantasy show is evident as each episode progresses. We get quite an adequate amount of characterization on the main cast. And many times, I think it\u2019s easy to find yourself anticipating what may happen next with the numerous cliffhangers the show offers. Indeed, Re:Zero is less of a \u2018trapped in game\u2019 style story but more of a fantasy thriller. Every episode offers something the fans will hunger for. And if that\u2019s not enough, then you\u2019re watching it wrong.\\n",

            "content": "A final review of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu \r\n(Re-updated; it may contain some spoilers, so be aware of it):\r\n================================\r\n\"If you are suddenly summoned to another fantasy world without any kind of preparation, what will you do?\" \r\nSome of the reactions of other people is that some of them would really panic and do not know what to do... but on Subaru's case (the main character of the story), he is 'trying' to rationalize his situation even though he experienced different kinds of despair and other negative emotions about his current situation and trying to adapt to his new environment. At first, he is tryingto stabilize his mental state and too desperate about what will happened on his situation. After that, he gradually gained some information about his current situation. On the later scenes, he met this beautiful elf girl named Emilia who saved him on a unexpected pinch situation; more like a boy-meets-girl situation, and then... the wicked-like fantasy adventure of Subaru begins and how the lives of other important people who he met throughout the story that could affect his decision-making on his unfortunate situation. How can he survive?\\n\\n\r\nThis show, Re:Zero is one of the great anime shows premiered on Spring 2016 that exemplifies the life of a certain boy named Subaru in a fantasy world and how he could adapt to his new environment. It would surely enjoy most of the viewers who like fantasy-themed or 'isekai-themed' anime shows to watch this kind of show because it seems 'not usual' to other similar-themed anime shows; it is filled with action, comedy, drama, and some thrilling and unexpected time-traveling and dark-themed scenarios... Wait... Time-traveling? Dark-themed?! How is it possible? Well, he noticed that he can not use any kind of magical powers but later on, he realized that he gained an ability called 'returns by death' when he was on a pinch situation. As the skill name itself, he can go back to a certain time and place where he could start again his adventure. Later on, he discovered that he has this kind of 'shadow(?)' magical attribute. Those mysterious ability and magical attribute are really helpful in his situation but also somewhat makes his situation more complicated or pain-in-the-ass because of its 'unknown(?)' origin. At first, the story-line seems confusing, depending on the viewer's perspective but it really gives dark/mysterious-vibe and cliffhanger scenes which surely gives us viewers more hype and thrills in this show! Generally-speaking, this anime is not the best but it is definitely one of the best anime shows of Spring 2016!\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the multimedia and other aspects of this anime show are very good, specially the character designs that really emphasized the unique traits of each characters in the story. If you know about the animation studio called White Fox (the animation studio of this anime show), it would really show that it has similarities on their animation style and forte on making their own style. If you know those similar anime shows they created, it would really increase the impact towards the entertainment of the show. In my opinion, there are some quality flaws in other animation stuffs like CGI and other designs on some episodes that are not really well-fitted or blended to the show. Nevertheless, those are not really a big negative factor to the show and does not really affect the quality and the development of the story-line. On the positive-side, I really like the animation stuffs like the point-of-view angles they emphasized on some scenarios on some episodes and it really follows the concept of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening & ending songs are so great and also fitted to the theme of the show (e.g. the lyrics and the style of the songs), which I also like in this anime show. I did not expect that pop punk-ish(?) OP theme song was performed by Konomi Suzuki, and I do not know what would be my reaction towards that since her usual J-pop anime song styles are really not like that. In my opinion, the new anisong artist MYTH & ROID's mysterious-and-futuristic-style J-pop theme songs of this anime is better in this anime show compared to Konomi Suzuki's opening song. In addition, there are no really obvious and noticeable errors on the multimedia aspects of the show like audio timing etc. The voice actors and actresses are also very talented that they really portray to their specific character roles. Some of them are newly popular with the anime fans like the CV of Emilia (Rie Takahashi) and the CV of Rem (Inori Minase), which can contribute more to the audience impact of the show. In addition to that, they also performed some of the OSTs, therefore it really shows their professionalism towards the show. The BGMs are really great and it and fitted to the action and other scenes of this show, which also mainly contribute to the impact of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline of this anime show is one of the greatest factor that mostly contributes to the impact of the show, including those amazing plot twists in every episode. Even though the story was rushed, I really like how this anime show would try to show some important plot contents from Re:Zero's light novel, which the animators/creator(s) of this anime really want us to fully enjoy the every 20-min episodes. The characters are also great because they provided great character designs that could somehow adds to the entertainment value of the show. Personally-speaking, the light novel is a 'must-read' to those fans who want to fully understand what Re:Zero's plot is all about.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the character traits, it was somewhat positively contributed to the audience impact on the show that later on, it creates that 'waifu' war between cute and loyal demon/maid girl named Rem the beautiful elf girl named Emilia or called EMT by Subaru and the fans. Furthermore, most of those characters have their unique lifestyles like the like Subaru who has really unique traits and 'realistic-like' personality compared to the other main characters out there; he is more vulnerable and has this kind of 'irrationalism' that makes him more 'human' compared to other common and overpowered main characters with god-like powers that were mostly existed on other popular anime shows, therefore it creates a different kind of twist to the story. The supporting characters like Rem & Ram, Puck, Beatrice, and other villain characters are also very important to the development of the story; they have their own character developments and big involvement throughout the story, therefore they are also somewhat popular to the audience. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the show's entertainment value, some people would not really enjoy/appreciate the concept of 'moe' characters, un-emphasized development of other important characters because of limited time, some clich\u00e9 elements like the concept of 'isekai' or other world with fantasy setting, and the unusual main character's behavior that were integrated in Re:Zero's story. It is because it ruins the seriousness of the story or it somehow deviates the norms and concepts of an usual fantasy or other related genre to the theme of Re:Zero. Despite of that, it is still interesting because of its uniqueness and somehow entertaining to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nWith all those double-eged critics/controversies/rumors we've heard, I can assure you that this show's is very interesting and breath-taking in each episodes, which is a big proof that this anime show is one-of-the-best anime of Spring 2016. Well, you can see it for yourself to confirm that and I really hope that this review would encourage someone who does not any or little idea about this show to watch this! Also, for those who knows this show, encourage them to watch this show.\\n\\n\r\n(P.S.: If you have really no idea about this anime, there are Part A and B in Episode 1, so do not forget to watch those to fully understand the story's synopsis!)\\n\\n\r\n================================\\n\\n\r\nTechnical Score: 8.25\\n\r\nBias/Personal Score: 9\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8.63 \u2248 9\\n\\n\r\n================================",

            "content": "No spoilers.\r\nThere are two types of haters of this show. One group is made up of elitists who overanalyze the show, and the other group consists of people who can't even understand the show and call it edgy. What both groups do not understand is the purpose of the anime.\r\nThe anime is about the development of Subaru's character, and it is executed brilliantly.\r\nWhat makes a show good? A good show should be easy to follow while still challenging the audience to think. It should appeal to the audience's emotions, and most importantly, it should be entertaining. Re:Zero does all of these things excellently. \r\nSome criticsargue that there are several plot holes in the story, but it really depends on their definition of plot holes. There are only a few trivial attributes of the world that are left unexplained as the excess of worldbuilding would detract from the flow of the show. Re:Zero builds suspense not only with every failure of Subaru's but also with every success of his. It is an emotional roller coaster from start to end, be it frustration with or sympathy and empathy for the main character.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThe story is brilliantly written. Yes, symbolism and references are shoved blatantly in front of the audience. Why? Because normal people do not watch a TV show and thoroughly analyze it. One example of the brilliant writing in the anime is the allusion to a Japanese folktale. It is used to foreshadow or subtly hint at the backstory of a character. How often does something like this happen in other TV shows and movies? The show forces the audience to think, but it doesn't confuse the audience with obscure and unexplained references.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nSome argue that too many of the characters are flat and generic. However, the show also dives into the minds of other characters, Rem and Emilia. Although most of the minor characters are one-dimensional, it makes sense that these two are developed as they are also main characters of the show. The addition of development on minor characters would simply blur the show's focus and turn it into a mess.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of Subaru's character is logical. It may be too realistic for some, but watching his human nature is enthralling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWhite Fox used the facial expressions and movements of the characters to capture their emotions, which was extremely captivating. The art is beautiful, but some CG was also used. The fight scenes are average.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nEverything sounds great from the OST to the openings, endings, and insert songs. Insert songs throughout the anime are especially powerful, expressing the mood of each episode at the perfect time.\\n\\n\r\nIt is interesting to see that so many elitists hate the show. After all, the show is a deconstruction of the generic overpowered main character, similar to Evangelion. Perhaps elitists simply hate new, popular anime.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, elitists do not represent the majority of anime watchers. Everyone should still watch this show and decide for themselves whether it is good or bad.",

            "content": "Before I start my review, let me just say one thing - FUCKING WATCH THIS SHIT! You will never expect what's coming if you just base your opinion on its premise or art style.\r\nMoving on, if there is just one thing that I had to choose to say why Re:Zero stands among the best of the best, it is the realistic take on a fantasy world MC (Subaru)... and the character growth (read suffering) that he goes through. Some arcs were just plain depressing and disgusting to watch. How pathetic can the main character get? Well, that's where this anime outshines most others. This makesthe final redemption arc all the more satisfying to watch. And it's not just Subaru, there's Rem! Right from her initial reaction to Subaru to the culmination of everything beautiful in episode 18, it was perfect. Same goes for Emilia. From the kinda uptight girl that saves Subaru in EP1 to the conclusive finale where she goes through an emotional release (in a good way), her character, while it didn't develop much, grew to be more open. I can keep on talking about the other characters, but I think Tappei (the author) did a wonderful job here. So characters? 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 9/10\\n\r\nKudos to White Fox for doing such an amazing job. Lots of wallpaper worthy shots.\\n\\n\r\nOST - 9/10\\n\r\nAgain, White Fox did an amazing job here plugging in the songs at very appropriate times. Not a big fan of any of the OPs. But the endings, goddamn. Episode 18 stands out as one of the best use of a song ever ~ (Wishing by Rem). And that title drop gave me goosebumps.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\r\nEver watched an anime that just the perfect mix of action, adventure, comedy, romance, mystery, drama, tragedy, etc? You haven't yet, if you have not watched Re:Zero. Right from the delightfully comedic interactions between Rem/Ram and Subaru at the start to Subaru's distressing and pitiful redemption arc, it was just so wholesome and complete. However, the story was not perfect. Some decisions the MC makes, make no sense whatsoever. But they can be overlooked when you think how good it integrates the different genres.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, I'm going to add one more category for the rating - Community. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nWatching an anime episode after episode on the day it airs might be frustrating sometimes. But in the case of Re:Zero it just made the anime all the more enjoyable. Thanks mostly in part to r/anime, r/Re_Zero, twitter, MAL and also /a/. Having a community to share the meltdowns and good moments with, is something that cannot be put in words.\\n\\n\r\nSo, just go ahead and marvel in the glorious suffering anime that is Re:Zero, while I sit here wishing I can start this anime, again, from Zero.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2, WHEN?\\n",

I thought this up until the last scene were the main character is murdered. Soon afterward he \"respawns\" at a fruit stand in the market, this is what hooked me. I realized that this anime is doing something no anime has done before. It made me care about the characters, and even become sad when they died even though I knew it would just be reset when Subaru dies.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe story wasn't just a lovestory, it was a journey of drama, loss, friendship, and enemies.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful. I wasn't dissapointed with it at any point. It gave a great atmosphere for each situation and made sure you could take in each detail that was presented. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe openings and endings both fit the anime very well.

They all had some amount of importance and are built up so you care about them a certain amount. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\r\nI was kept in the edge of my seat throughout the whole anime. There were times of calm between \"respawns\" that were used to build the characters, but that didn't take anything away from my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime wasn't prefect, no anime is.

            "content": "Note: This review was written a while ago when the show was over. Thus, it does not necessarily represent my current opinions, writing, scores or anything really. Still, I somewhat stand with the core ideas of the review.\r\nWill this review ever get noticeable enough to be featured in the top of all the other reviews? No. I like expressing my opinions on all of the shit I watch. Sometimes there are times where an anime comes by and I need to make a full review instead of adding my opinions on the \"tags\" section. This review is directed for those who found my profile andare interested on reading my full opinions on this series. Minor spoilers ahead. I hope anyone who reads this enjoys my rambling review of the hottest show of Spring and Summer seasons, Re:Zero.\\n\\n\r\nWHAT'S UP WITH ALL THE HYPE?:\\n\r\nI'm confident when I say Re:Zero was the surprise of Spring 2016. When Winter was ending and we got a look of all the shows that were debuting, no one was talking about this. Everyone was too caught up with Boku no Hero Academia, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Kiznaiver, Bungou Stray Dogs and Joker Game. As soon as the first hour-long episode aired, the community was divided on those who thought it had the strongest start of the season, and those who thought it was another \"stuck in another world\" show trying to be edgy and having cute girls falling for the main guy. I didn't get into the hype train until approximately Episode 6 or so and damn, this was an incredible experience. I've always hated Sundays because I knew I had to study study study, and the thought of having to go to school/get shit done was a pain. After I found Re:Zero, Sundays became my favorite day of the week.\\n\\n\r\nA thing that bothers me is that many people tend to hate on really popular shows BECAUSE they are popular. I know there are some who have a valid reason for not liking a show like this, but it pisses me off when people hate on a show because it's becoming mainstream. A trend I started noticing is that people flew to compare it to a certain show that is is known for dividing the community between those who think it's \"THE BEST ANIMU EVA\" and those who think it's the lowest piece of trash ever, Sword Art Online. At first glance you could probably say their are some similarities. A guy gets transported to another world, meets a bunch of new people and ultimately meets a girl that changes his life. However, go deeper into the story and you'll soon realize it is nothing like SAO. From the \"time travel\" elements, to the complex rules regarding the world and far more interesting characters, Re:Zero far exceeds SAO as far as I'm concerned. Not really worth mentioning because it's very obvious if you actually watch the thing, but this comparison of these two completely different shows with a completely different set of ideas bothered me to death.\\n\\n\r\nSCATTERED REVIEW: \\n\r\nMan this show is painful to watch, in the best possible way. Since I started paying attention to seasonal anime, I have never seen an anime that moved me as much as Re:Zero has. It is the first show (including TV series) that had me on the edge of my seat, desperately waiting for the next epsiode to come out. Instead of \"Re:Zero\", a more appropriate title for this show would be \"Re:Cliffhanger\". I have to admit that at one point I thought that this show was over-reliant on cliffhangers. It uses cliffhangers on situations where it's not necessary, raising your expectations to later find out that it wasn't anything all that special. It may sound like a bad thing, but this method is extremely effective at making the viewer watch \"one more episode to find out what this cliffhanger was about\", later to realize it's already midnight and you just binge watched the whole thing in one sitting.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals on this are pretty solid. Does it have 10/10 animation? Not really. It has its down times (especially during fight scenes), but other times it has really amazing visuals. What I can say is that it has good enough animation to make it work. Where I think shines the brightest is the sound. All the openings and ending songs are catchy as hell and the show knows when to use what track to peek the drama. The best word I would use to describe the soundtrack is memorable. When I listen to certain songs, it takes me back to an important scene and that is the best part about it.\\n\\n\r\nA complaint I heard is people complaining that the MC is abnoxious making the show unwatchable, but doesn't some of the most highly acclaimed shows have annoying characters that make stupid decisions? Look at Neon Genesis Evangelion as an example. I personally haven't seen it as of the creation of this review, but I've heard Shinji is a huge pain in the ass. People need to have in mind that these characters are created this way for a reason, either to progress the plot or make things a bit more interesting. I'm not saying you need to like Subaru as a person, but keep in mind that he is supposed to be an unlikable character at times. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I wanted to talk about is that people were calling this a \"harem\". From what I understand, a show is considered a \"harem\" when 3 or more girls are romantically interested in the main guy. During the whole season, only two characters are shown being romantically involved with Subaru: Rem (best girl) and Emilia (she's alright). It doesn't bother me personally, but I found it funny how people quickly threw the \"it's a harem\" card before most of the characters and character dynamics were even introduced. Is it because it has a bunch of cute girls, or is it because people want to call it a harem as an insult? The reasons are beyond me, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is the type of anime where your judgment will solely be based on enjoyment factor. This is not a series where you can point out how \"objectively good\" it is (which is a term I don't agree with).  If you take a step back and critique Re:Zero without bias, you will find that it lacks originality at times, and \"techincally\" doesn't have a proper plot or main goal. This will be major turn off to some since the anime never tells us why or how he gets transported to the parallel world, what's his purpose or what he needs to do in this world. The \"story\" of Re:Zero is basically this: the main protagonist is presented with various problems and he needs to find a way around them, whether it is survival or saving someone. In every arc, a new problem is presented and Subaru needs to find a way, using the knowledge he gains throughout his various lives with the help of his \"Return by Death\" ability, to solve it. I would say Re:Zero is more about the journey rather than solving or accomplishing something. This is taken as a fact considering that not even the source material has answered many of these questions. For the time being, light novel readers and anime watchers will have to wait until all our questions are answered.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero also suffers with contradictions, like how one episode Subaru is super idiotic and can't figure out what's going on (even if it's super obvious what's going on), and then later in other episodes comes up with smart and complex plans to save the day, making you wonder if he's supposed to be smart or dumb. An example where the opposite happens (an anime where people judge it not by how much entertainment they got from it, but by how well directed or how great is the story) is Legend of the Galactic Heroes. There's plenty of scenes that I would say are really good directed, but Re:Zero will have a greater impact if you care for the world and characters like I cared for them. If you don't care for the characters or for what's going on, you will not like Re:Zero (especially when the dramatic moments come).\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be very subjective in this statement, but Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World- is the complete package in terms of what I'm looking for in an anime. It has the mystery of \"what will happen next\", the characters are interesting and you care about them and want them to succeed, the world Tappei Nagatsuki (original creator) created is so massive and so open to possibilities that you can't help but make your own theories and wonder what new concept will be introduced next. It has the drama, the romance, the action, the comedy, just everything I'm looking.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\\n\r\nFrom what I'm seeing in the upcoming season, it is safe to say Re:Zero will be the most talked about show of the year (tied with probably Erased). I found this series one day when I was bored scrolling through my Crunchyroll. I watched the first hour-long episode and thought it was pretty good, but never I imagined it would be probably my favorite series ever. A few weeks in and I was completely obssessed with this show. It quickly earned a spot on my favorites list, even before it was finished. It never bothered me that the ending could turn out to be shit, because what it did during my whole viewing experience was enough. Nowhere I had seen a series where an entire episode (Ep. 18) could literally be two characters talking and be my favorite out of 25 episodes to choose from. I may sound like a 13-year-old fanboying for his favorite show, but I just wanted to make this rambling review to get my thoughts out there so I can go to bed at peace. \\n\\n\r\nAs expected from such a popular series, people from both sides of the coin (those who love it and those who hate it) have rushed to give their opinions now that the show is over. Re:Zero is truly the perfect example of an anime you will either love or hate. I can't tell you if Re:Zero is great, it all depends on you. Trust me, my lack of experience with other anime compared to other people and my bias makes me far from the guy to make a truly objective review. All I can do is tell you what it did to me. Reading all the reviews destroying the show and truly analyzing all its flaws with facts is a bit heartbreaking to read and made me see Re:Zero for what it is, but I can't deny the fact that I cried, I laughed, I rolled my eyes from how cringy the situation was, I got excited for the big reveals, I got chills when the drama peeked, and this \"piece of trash\" had me thinking more than any other anime I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 8.5\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this isn't for everyone. This review is very subjective and you have the right to disagree. What you can't disagree on is this: with all the hype behind this show, you can love Re:Zero, you can hate Re:Zero, but you can't ignore Re:Zero.",

            "content": "Re: Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu. \r\nContain so many similar elements from several anime, adapted, and executed perfectly. Even with so many similar elements from different anime mixed there, Re: Zero is still very original series in a sense of taste.\r\nThere's been some kind of weird mocking to some of the heroine in this anime in several forums, and that's been driving people straight to disinterest with the series. I hope there's nothing like that happening again in the future. Re:Zero is a great series, and people shouldn't be so disinterested with it because of cancerous community.\r\nThere's some aspects that I love about this anime:\r\n1)Main Protagonist's change of character.\\n\r\nPeople tend to hate a character with unsightly attitude in some event in anime or manga. But for me, it's something beautiful to see. It's stronger than seeing character that found new power. Some good character attitude development is really hard to pull since writer have to know, feel, or even experience some event that can trigger ones character. In this series, Subaru is one that have solid characteristic development in attitude.\\n\\n\r\n2) Literally got one set of attractive Heroines.\\n\r\nI can't deny that I'm really attracted to Rem after watched Episode 18. Emotions flows like roller coaster from hate to love. I really like the strong toddler magician that stays in her mansion to keep it safe. There's less of Ram involvement in that series so I can't make out any good impression of her so far. And of course, Emilia is one charming main heroine, but I hope there's more of her if there's ever a 2nd season, cuz I still enchanted to Rem more than Emilia.\\n\\n\r\n3) Interesting Story (of course it is but I just have to point it out)\\n\r\nThere's been some anime that has same kind of setting where the main protagonist trapped or goes to another world or dimension, the main protagonist can go back in time to change things better, set in kind of a medieval time. But Re:Zero really meshed all of that into one beautiful romantic fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nI really recommend this anime to you who loves series like Stein's Gate, Guilty Crown or GATE.",

            "content": "This is quite though anime to give insights on. There are a lot of part from this anime that I really like, as much as parts that I didn't really like. But I did enjoy this anime a lot and it is worth for overall 9.\r\nWhat I dislike:\r\n- Story coming in and out without proper prologue and ending. Why Subaru got suddenly sent to the fantasy world, what is his relation with the Witch, and so on. It will be exciting turnouts if audience got explained those things. I am truly expecting a longer series instead of 25 episodes. Something like HxH where in theend (perhaps) Emilia became the Queen and Subaru getting strong and defeat the Witch which is in the he became the King. Nice End.\\n\\n\r\n- Second! This is the one of the worst part is Subaru. Yes, for me his one of the worst main hero, he acting over-stupid & childish almost the entire series, not to mention he is weak af. He stayed too many episodes with that kinds of character and it really frustrating and exhausting to watch him doing stupid thing, acting irresponsibility, and helpless all the time. Seriously...when I start watching this anime I was REALLY expecting he is somehow awaken a specialised strong skill (other than keep on dying and repeat) but as the episodes gone one by one, he is truly not moving up in terms of strength (only got that stupid shumac). Although he did getting strong mentally, for Godsake...that was after die at least 3 times for the same events. I have seen a long anime series like HunterXHunter which is the character developed very well the entire series. They have up and down, but they are progressing in all kinds of way which Subaru doesn't have.\\n\\n\r\n- Betelgeuse Romanee Conti. Really the most annoying antagonis in anime. He just simply a psychotic and to make it worst, he out-powered the main character (Subaru) by far. Seriously, why it so hard just to give him death. I prefer character like him die once and then Subaru met the witch. Conti really psychotic and an antagonis without charisma.\\n\\n\r\n- Last! The series is again...TOO SHORT. I am really expecting for second season with a proper finishing episodes. Not hanging like this. When the story start we have TONS of characters introduced on each arch. Not to mention Felt! She is suddenly brought up from slump to the kingdom but then that's it. She doesn't make any difference in the story at all in the end. It will be nice also that each candidate have their own arch story (just like Wilhem got for himself, his romance story when he was young, a background story to be precise) \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like:\\n\r\n- Rem. Yes Rem. And maybe most of other audience does. Rem is one of those character that progressing REALLY WELL in the story. You can see how she change throughout the episodes. how and why her relationship and feelings for Subaru growing strong. She is strong and yet you can find a soft spot in her character.\\n\\n\r\n- The romance conflict. I might say the romance conflict is really nice. Emilia is loveable, Rem also loveable, Subaru have a strong will and he is really expressive (too much most of the time) and all the romance conflict is relevant to each individual background (Emilia being a half elf silver haired witch, Rem being a half devil, Subaru being stupid and helpless but strong will) Not to mention that Subaru forbidden to mention his Reset ability which is make the case even harder. But what I think audience need to get is that love romance doesn't developing faster than the series and ended up hanging (as I said before it need a longer series to make it a complete story and finish)\\n\\n\r\n- Wilhelm arc story. It is beautiful imo and it gives a different wind to the story. I was hoping if there will be the next season for Re Zero, they will come up with more background story (just like Wilhelm story) like the story of each kingdom ruler candidate history and side story. (We don't even know Emilia and Subaru background story for Godsake! We don't know who they are, why Puck tagging along with Emilia and kept on saying Emilia as her daughter etc, where they come from, how do they got into their current character they are) I am seriously have no idea why the author doesn't make it an agenda to make proper introduction on each character. Which is will help to make a greater emotional connection for the audience with each character.\\n\\n\r\n- Emotional connection. I got pretty nice emotional connection with Rem since she got introduced quite a lot to the audience. But somehow I despise Subaru and technically don't care with him, which is actually bad thing since he is the main character. I just hope he doesn't hurt Emilia and Rem more than he does.\\n\\n\r\nArts:\\n\r\nThe art is cool. I love the coloring, the face construction. Art always been kinda priority for me before continuing the series and Re Zero doing great. Emilia is so loveable, Rem, and most any girl in the series. The man varies from bishounen to shounen. The environment really rich in colour and details. But I have seen better in Kabaneri, Inari konkon, bakemonogatari series, so I will settle with Score 9 here in arts.\\n\\n\r\nSound;\\n\r\nI love the ending and opening which I find it suited with the anime theme and all. I just hope they make instrumental soundtrack during the scenes instead of the full voice music. Styx Helix really bring a strong atmosphere of romance and battle, Paradisus Paradoxium also. Myth & Roid really fit into the anime so well, and the way the music mixed really match with the weird theme of Subaru got summoned to another world with reset ability (or curse). 'Stay Alive' in contrast is a soft spot in the series that really fit all Emilia x Subaru x Rem in term of romance. But for 'Redo' I don't particularly find it fit with the anime but still I like this anyway (don't know if it because I love the anime that I then love the theme song or vice versa)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAs I said in the start, I have like and dislike but in the end I enjoy the anime a lot. I enjoy and quite hopeful with the next episodes since the first episode. But then they leave me hanging with that episode no.25. \\n\\n\r\nI DEMAND 2ND SEASON! I DEMAND EXPLANATION & I DEMAND A PROPER ENDING!",

            "content": "This review of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu is solely based on my personal views and overall enjoyment watching the show.\r\nStory: With the influx of all these anime shows about a protagonist being transported into a fantasy world/game, this specific show, Re:Zero, certainly doesn\u2019t sound like anything special. In fact, when I first heard about the anime announcement for this show, I was pleasantly surprised but not at all hoping for anything that would blow me away. To me, I was hovering around the idea that if anything, I would enjoy watching the show because \u2013 while not original \u2013 it might end up beingsomething fun. This is coming from someone who only briefly skimmed through the manga and had no true prior experience with this series from the light novel or web novel before watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing this show, I really had a hard time figuring out how I wanted to say what I wanted to say about all the things that happened, all the things that I felt while watching Re:Zero. One thing was sure, Re:Zero\u2019s story was anything but special. But I feel like the point was, that while it was only average in terms of bare story, how the author developed the story \u2013 and characters (which I\u2019ll get to later on) truly made Re:Zero something special to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Where do I even begin? This show has some better character development I\u2019ve seen in a long time. I\u2019m sure a lot of people will disagree with me, but that\u2019s just how I felt. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m right, but I\u2019ll go into a little detail as to why I think so. One particular character that receives a lot of hate for what he does and how he acts is Subaru, the protagonist of Re:Zero. I can understand how people feel, but the self-reflection and growth that Subaru had by the end of this series was truly something unique. \\n\\n\r\nI know, I know - this is a fantasy setting, but how realistically portrayed the feelings of each of the characters is depicted really sold it for me. Obviously not every character had the same \u201cgod-tier\u201d character development as, let\u2019s say Subaru or Rem (I won\u2019t go into them anymore than I already have, I don\u2019t want major spoilers), but something that I found myself doing was actually caring about characters - characters that weren\u2019t necessarily the main focus. I actually was interested in characters like Wilhelm and his quest, and cared about him enough to hope he was successful. From the friendship of Subaru and Julius, to how Felis felt doing something he didn\u2019t want to do, I actually cared about the characters and how they felt. All these moments were what made this show much more than I could have ever asked for.\\n\\n\r\nArt: There really isn\u2019t much for me to say about the art. It fit the show. There were certainly moments that I thought the CG looked off, but for the most part, they did a good job with consistency. And I have to give them props for not using CG for some major scenes with big creatures flying around in the sky. (I\u2019m sure you guys know/will know what I\u2019m talking about after watching the show). \\n\\n\r\nSound: Oh man, this category. What can I say? White Fox did an outstanding job setting a mood with the right music. I felt so many emotions that I probably wouldn\u2019t have felt if they hadn\u2019t went the extra mile with the right background music, or the right ringtone in a scene. The amount of effort that White Fox put into each and every detail in the sound department was award winning in my honest opinion. They made the scenes that were already great, exponentially better because of how they used the score/OST. Also, props to the voice actors/actresses. Some of the VAs must have worked their asses off to pull off the voices we heard in the show. I honestly have nothing but praise for the VAs and sound department working on this show. They did one hell of a job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Obviously, as enjoyment is subjective from person to person, I won\u2019t expect you all to agree with me on liking this show. Some people are more critical. Some people want to hate because they didn\u2019t like how the show\u2019s direction went. It could be because two characters didn\u2019t end up together that you really \u201cshipped\u201d together. Or it could be because you didn\u2019t like the main character and how they acted. But in the end, my personal enjoyment is pretty important as to how I rate a show. And while there were moments I didn\u2019t like as much as others, it wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t like the show. Those moments, where I didn\u2019t like a character, or direction, honestly was just a byproduct of how invested I was in Re:Zero and its characters. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is a deconstruction of your every-day, generic transported-to-a-fantasy-world-esque show, and I certainly think the show does a pretty solid job at what it set out to do. It defied my expectations and went the extra mile in so many categories - especially the sound department (which I can't stop emphasizing). It made me feel connected to not just the main characters, but to many of the side characters, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt this invested in a show and its characters for a long time. Now, after reading this far I'm sure you know where I stand at least in terms of recommendation. Would I recommend Re:Zero? Yes. I really would. Do I expect everyone to like it as much as I did? No. Definitely not - after all, this show wasn't perfect - it's far from it. But I personally feel like it\u2019s worth giving a watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\n/============== Scores ==============/\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8.2\\n\\n\r\n/=================================/",

            "content": "Ahh Re:Zero, the anime that is in my opinion looking to be the best show this year (beating erased). The anime that actually inspired me to write my first anime review, despite me being a lazy fk. \r\nApart from having excellent art, soundtrack, story, voice acting (especially voice acting) and direction (pacing) there are several underlying themes and messages (sometimes subliminal/hidden ones like in its OP). This is a show that will go against all of your preconceptions, judgements and/or expectations of a trapped-in-an-another-world type anime and will present to you something that feels entirely original somehow. It's one of those don't-judge-a-book-by-its-cover type shows. \r\nThereare many things I could talk about this show that would take too long to express, so I'm just gonna stick with presenting some plus and negative points.\\n\\n\r\n+ Interesting story about a shut-in neet suddenly appearing in fantasy world and has a strange respawn ability 'return by death'. With no purpose/reason for his summoning he has to cling to those around him and deal with things that will challenge his very sense of self. My synopsis might seem cliche and uninteresting but since I'm lazy I cbf going too much in-depth (I'll probably spoil it anyway). The story however is surprisingly the strong point because I consider the world-building in this show to be top-notch. Even though it has a time-travel attribute, it is not similar to Steins;Gate (which casts a shadow of expectation over it). It is a fantasy story first and foremost, and a very well made one at that (not the harem/romance type or Lord of the Rings type fantasy, it's more like a 'follow the journey of the MC through the world' type fantasy). It certainly isn't predictable, cliche or boring to watch (except the first few episodes). \\n\\n\r\n+ Soundtrack is very good. It doesn't simply have catchy OP's and ED's but impressive orchestral music and also utilises the sounds of objects, breathing, movements to really set the tone of the scene and your expectations of what is about to happen. Episode 15 is a good example of this.\\n\\n\r\n+ Right off from episode 1 we see very good art/animation (but not so good during some slice of life scenes). It manages to be fairly consistent throughout each episode and does give off the feeling of watching a well-made show. Character designs are also top-notch, with characters that actually add to the story being drawn well enough to be memorable; almost all characters/creatures were unique looking as well. I don't think there's a single character that looked boring, plain or weird. \\n\\n\r\n+ The biggest selling point of this show is its constant sense of mystery, foreshadowing and the whats-gonna-happen next factor. Unless you've read the light novels for this show there is no way you can predict what happens next, even on a minute-to-minute basis. It was almost a 'one cliffhanger per episode' situation going on. Although this is fairly what you'd expect from time-travel like plot, the plot twists and cliffhangers don't feel off-putting, outlandish or just plain weird (think Mirai Nikki's weird ending). Instead they actually do what they are supposed to do - shock and hook you, get you hyped and make it hard for you to stop binge-watching. The best comparison to this feeling is watching Game of Thrones. \\n\\n\r\n+ Main plus point for me was the fact that RZ took an overused genre, flipped it on its head and excluded nearly every character and plot trope that makes the genre so hated. Although its not blatantly presented to the audience, there were several central themes that were strongly developed that were in my opinion quite meaningful. Primarily, the deconstruction of what a true hero/protagonist should be was a key reason why I rated the show even higher than I might normally do. \\n\r\nAlthough it happens a lot in anime, the dialogue, execution and specific way the show demonstrated this theme, was quite unique (chiefly that its 'unlike' most shows) and outstanding. For the sake of brevity, I'd suggest watching the show to judge it for yourself but I think one would at least somewhat agree with me on this. \\n\\n\r\nDespite having many other +'s I could talk about I'm just gonna skip to the negatives cos this is getting TL;DR.\\n\\n\r\n+/- Main character Natsuki Subaru does not follow that standard behaviours you'd expect from a protagonist. Although he isn't made into a sort of anti-hero or villain like Light Yagami (death note) he certainly isn't a great person. This show is really self-aware of the kind of things a protagonist should do but it instead illustrates a MC that doesn't necessarily always do it. In short, the MC isn't made to be appeal to the audience's expectations (he, like the other characters in the show, feel poly-dimensional), so often there are cringy scenes/dialogue/inner thoughts around Subaru that can really make you dislike him at some points, but you can be rest assured that he does end up redeeming himself. He becomes the protagonist we all want in the end - starting from zero hehe. Essentially his character could decide whether its a plus or minus point for you. If you don't take the time to understand his character, and pay close attention to the show, it's likely you'll think he's dumb, over-dramatic or whatever (which is what most critics try to argue); which is a shame because he is actually very well-written. \\n\\n\r\n- This does not affect me personally but there are some hard-to-watch scenes, blood and gore so it might not appeal to everyone. I certainly don't think its done to the point where you'd just want to drop the show but I can say that it doesn't hold back at trampling over your heart lol. In other words, there is plenty of shock value but there is always a 'weight' to the gore, unlike Tokyo Ghoul where there is literally blood/gore everywhere all the time and you don't feel anything, its more like that feeling when you first watched Attack on Titan and you're just there like 'WHY? OH WHY?'\\n\\n\r\nOverall it doesn't matter if you think its good or bad at first, I would recommend just diving into it because regardless of its plot, it is definitely one of the best shows this year. Most of the hate the show receives is pretty much coming from people who want to de-rate it because they weren't that impressed, or they completely missed the meaningful points the show presents etc., and they end up using nit-pickery arguments or misrepresent/misunderstand/over-exaggerate some of its negatives. Trust me, it's not nearly as bad as any negative reviewer would make you believe. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is a fun show to get hooked on. It doesn't primarily concern itself with being philosophical, something really deep or trying to be a masterpiece - although episode 18 and some other episodes show potent and interesting digressions of human nature. Its not the best thing ever, but it definitely is above average. \\n\\n\r\nYou can really see how it is a passion project and that White Fox has put it in a lot of effort into it. It's definitely a must-watch show. Although it does have some flaws (mainly near the ending of the show), the cumulation of so many amazing moments and the dramatic, fun and interesting ride that I went on while watching this convinced me to award it a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nP.S If I had to rate it as objectively as possible I'd still give it as least an 8/10 but it just doesn't feel right. It simply excels in every department I can think about (or care about anyway), exceeded my expectations and was just too enjoyable a show to give it an 8.",

            "content": "I'm pretty sure some of you are thinking that Re: Zero is another overhyped anime that isn't nowhere near the hype it deserves. Well, let me just say it now: Re: zero deserves all of that hype and score, or at least most of it. It is an exceptional anime, composed of many different kinds of elements that elevates the anime even further. The entertainment (and despair) it manages to give every single episode is astounding, and paired with great characters and great animation and music, makes this anime truly a must watch for any anime fan.\r\nYou probably have already seen this kind of apremise before. The main character living in a normal world, suddenly gets dragged into a completely different world. And also time travel. It is not the most unique premise by any means, but time travelling as a genre has been one of the more difficult ones to work with. In anime, time travel might not make sense, create gigantic plot holes, and can potentially halt any kind of character development. Unfortunately, Re:Zero does have some small plot holes regarding time traveling, but that's to be expected since the story is not yet completed. However, Re:Zero still brilliantly manages to weave in the time travelling aspect of it so that it still manages to be entertaining and bring a good development.\\n\r\nI also feel like that this anime is a great example of how to make every single episodes. It doesn't drag, nor feel boring. Each and every episode is just so fun and makes you want to watch more and more of it. Another awesome thing to point out is that, Re:zero sometimes likes to omit openings and endings in some episodes, giving it even more minutes to work with, which was awesome to see, as one thing I feel like most anime need more of is time. (This is not saying the openings and endings are bad in any way.).\\n\r\nOne unfortunate thing about this anime however, is the fact that the adaptation isn't close to finishing yet, so we are left with a lot of unanswered questions. Lot of things like the essence of how Subaru is able to go back to a certain checkpoint or the fate of the bowel hunter is still unclear. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also fantastic. It doesn't have clunky movements nor uncomfortable lighting. The fight scenes are great to watch, but the best parts for me were those lighting touches in the background which contrasted well with whatever the scene given. Sometimes light, sometimes dark, it just affects the mood of the scene so well. Some episodes, the animation is done so brilliantly that some scenes almost feels like a movie.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound section is great as well.. The soundtracks are really nice to listen to, the standouts being the ones with choir,  and they accompany the scenes really well, especially in episode 15. It isn't a standout of the anime, but it is definitely worth noting, as it manages to stay consistent throughout the episodes. The voice acting in Re:Zero is amazing. The seiyuus, especially Kobayashi Yuusuke (Subaru), bring out some amazing emotions from the characters, which obviously is a must have in a despair-inducing anime like Re:Zero. Also, who can forget Yoshitsugu Matsuoga's unbelivable performance on Beteleguese? The voices aren't annoying, the soundtracks are great, and the OP/ED are one of the best of the season. It is just a really solid aspect in the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow the most important part in any anime: the characters. First thing is, I see a LOT of hate for Subaru. Granted he isn't strong and is sometimes frustrating to watch, but I personally don't think he's that bad of a character. We see him struggle, fight against the seemingly impossible, and eventually develop as the series goes on. He might not be the most pleasing MC to watch at first, but I feel like this is what Re:Zero is all about: Natsuki Subaru's development. You first see a guy, cocky and arrogant, who runs into hopeless despair, so useless, yet trying to do everything by himself, transform into a guy who willingly seeks help from others to save Emilia and many others from the horrible fate awaiting them. \\n\r\nThere are also a lot of other diverse characters in the show. Rem, for example, is easily the most likable character in the show. Her strong willed determination and great fighting prowess is a shining light to Subaru in many ways. We also have Emilia, Suabru's love interest and a half elf trying to ascend the throne although being discriminated by others for being too similar to a witch. The relationship between her and Subaru, although at times cliche, develops throughout the series, along with Subaru's personality.\\n\r\nOne thing I like about Re:Zero is that it literally has everything in terms of characters: Struggling MC, powerful woman beside the MC, maids, lolis, traps, knights, psychos... everything.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, Re:Zero is definitely a must watch show from the year of 2016. Its intensity, suspense, plot twists, and development makes the hype completely justifiable imo. The awesome fights and dramatic cliffhangers all add to the anime. Though the story itself is might not yet completed, the questions might still remiain, these unanswered questions only further serve as a good reason to watch the next season of this great anime. \\n",

            "content": "Re:Zero is the story about Natsuki Subaru who is summoned to another world, a magical world. He befriends or more like falls in love with a half elf girl who saves his life from hoodlums so in return Subaru wants to help her finding her lost insignia. He and the girl are killed by another person while looking for the insignia. Just then Subaru finds himself alive back to the moment when he came in this new world with the memories of his death and everything that happened. And so starts the great journey of Subaru.\r\nNow Speaking of Subaru he surely was a good maincharacter, well he was cringy sometimes but dude was a gentleman and likeable unlike other trap in another world anime MC *cough Kirito-sama cough*. Characters overall were mostly good Our main heroine(don\u2019t know if telling her name will be a spoiler) is really kind, beautiful and strong lady and no tsundere characteristics thats a win right?. She doesn\u2019t get much time in second half but the person who gets that time is REM!!!!! Yes the best girl, The Ultimate waifu material!. OK that is not really how I think about her but she gets a lot of development than any other female character and she is quite lovable. Other characters don\u2019t really get much time but its ok at least they\u2019re likeable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I liked about Re:zero other than the characters was the amount of substance. There were so many events and it felt that the show is progressing at a fine pace. OH and the animation was great as well same goes for sound. Voice acting was really good especially the voice acting of the villain Petelgeuse. \\n\\n\r\nThere were so many cute moments and then there were insanely brutal and heart-wrenching scenes. I felt bad for the Subaru when he was in pain, I smiled when rem did, it was just so nice.I cared for the characters and that\u2019s another win\\n\\n\r\nAND OH MY KAMI-SAMA EP 15!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Re:zero was an amazing experience for me. I enjoyed the hell out of it without turning my brain off. Great characters, great animation and sound and heart wrenching moments, Its just great and I don\u2019t think there is any need to find anything bad in it of course there might be some but I really recommend you to watch it. 8.75 out of 10\\n\\n\r\n+great animation and sound\\n\r\n+loveable characters especially Rem\\n\r\n+A progressing story\\n\r\n-A slow start(truly slothful)\\n\r\n-still there is need for season 2. Can\u2019t wait for it my head trembles!!\\n",

            "content": "This was hands down one of the best anime I have ever seen, The story, art and soundtracks fit together like pieces of the same puzzle giving off - Depending on situation - A feeling of happiness or despair. It will keep you at the edge of your seat craving for more, and that's exactly why I waited for it to finish airing in order to start watching.\r\nFor the first time I've sort of connected with the main character, and lived through the ups and downs of the story, felt happy at the heart-warming moments, and cried at the desperate ones.\r\nThis anime proves to usthat an MC doesn't always have to be Overpowered in order to look cool or be a true hero! Unlike your typical \"Transported to another world\" series, this one was truly a masterpiece unlike others, and didn't succumb to the stereotypical \"POWER LEVEL... OVER 9000!!\" idea that most Main characters transported to another world have.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't get me wrong, one doesn't have to be special, have unparalleled mana or Saitama-leveled physical power at all! This series shows us that willpower is enough in order to turn the tables, and to the point where even a weak human can become a hero.\\n\\n\r\nIf you put aside the fact that it's a fantasy anime, it won't get any more realistic than that! In my opinion the producers tried to make us understand something: You might go through lots of desperate moments, might lose people dear to you, make the wrong choices and despair, but that's exactly what it means to be human, we all make mistakes, a lot of them, but we all have the ability to fix them, and that is exactly what you'll witness in this series. And as I always say: \"If you try to move forward while looking back, you will -Without a doubt- trip and get hurt.\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of long reviews so I'll end it here, even if you know that it'll get a happy ending, YOU WILL GET HIT BY THE FEEL TRAIN! And dozens of times at that, but it'll be one hell of a ride and an amazing experience! It might sound weird saying this but even if it's an anime, you'll definitely get something out of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least, the one thing we shouldn't forget: #RemBestGirl2016!!",

            "content": "Hey there, do you enjoy watching a decent romance+drama+action anime with realistic characterisation that attempts and mostly succeeds in depicting the effects of a teenage boy seeing and even experiencing death over and over again? Well look no further, because if so, you have an interest in observing a mental breakdown and the subsequent road to redemption. Re: Zero depicts this fairly well.\r\nTo put it simply, Re: Zero has a distinct personality that is accused of being generic and edgy. Nothing quite screams generic as a character that makes mistakes and learns from them. It's almost as if he is human. If you never makemistakes or have an aversion to making mistakes and improving yourself, please avoid this show. \\n\\n\r\nA maturing male protagonist? Check. A mysterious female protagonist that raises more questions than answers? Check. Girls with washboard racks because such people actually exist, and where one of them may have feelings for the male protagonist because what is love? Double check. You have your average level of diversity of characters which allows a show to appeal to a wider demographic. Such characters include, the temperamentally affectionate one, the little people and the odd \"weird\" ones which definitely are indicative of a bland cast. Who wrote this?\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a melting pot of genres such as drama, romance, mystery, action and more which is a treat to watch in measured doses. Of course, i could compare it to another deconstruction such as madoka and point fingers all day accusing it of being a failed transplanted clone. I won't though. Who would do that? \\n\\n\r\nWith elements of mortality (or lack thereof) as well as violence and time travel, your expectations are sure to be sated unless you have an aversion to life itself which has its share of serious and light hearted moments. If you have an aversion to anime which depict both the ups and downs of existence, please avoid this show.\\n\\n\r\nI respect the characterisation of the male protagonist because he evolves from being a wide-eyed wannabe hero to twisted selfish person to knight in shining armour (minus the armour).\\n\r\nHe is a boy of many identities; Selfishbaru, Sadbaru, Madbaru, Badbaru, and Whippedbaru.\\n\\n\r\nArt was a little iffy for my taste but sound was satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nOverall - 8.6\\n\\n\r\nAm I 12?

            "content": "Well I\u00b4ve started watching Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu  not knowing what to expect.\r\nI\u00b4ve heard a lot of people comparing to other series such as KonoSuba or Gate, except a bit darker. During the first episode it seemed pretty casual, nothing really innovative, but at the end of the first arc I really wanted more. So, here goes my review for Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu. IT CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM THE FIRST 2 EPISODES.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story of Re:Zero is at times complicated, at times predictable. It is that contrast that makes it enjoyable. Of course, there are a lot of series with much morecomplicated plots, but they tend to be hard to watch. Re:Zero took a pretty simple story of a teenager somehow finding himself in this medieval fantasy word. Nothing new, right. Well, that is until the MC somehow goes back in time, after being murdered. That is one of the most important part of the story, as well the part which makes it less predictable. Some things will be going alright and then the MC just dies, and must do things all again. While I loved most of the story, there were a few episodes in the middle which felt a little bit too cringy and dragged out. Also, since it probably will have a 2nd season, the story left quite a few unanswered mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nYou can probably find quite a few shows with a fantasy colorful setting ( KonoSuba, as mentioned earlier), so what makes Re:Zero different. Well, this shows art and animation are fantastic in my opinion. The character have somewhat original faces, the background are usually filled with details, making the world seem more alive. The animation is nice and smooth, and they even managed to make big battles smooth through good 3D animations. Although some of the non-humans look too similar. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty good. The ambient makes it a much more enjoyable show, even through the more story-driven parts of the series. The battle music gets you hyped up. The intro was good\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a few very interesting characters, with good backstories. Our MC Subaru Natsuki is sometimes one of them. I don\u00b4t what to spoil much, but if you watch the show you\u00b4ll see what I mean. He sometimes acts very cool, other times he can be boring or even cringy. There are a few characters that will make you feel sad, some will make you hate them. MY main complain would be the sometimes appalling acting of the MC, and some other characters that were just dropped after a couple episodes without mentioning them anymore.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA cleverly written story, with a few twists, interesting characters, a lively world, a good soundtrack. It really feels like a compelling story, it can even make you interested in the history and lore of the world that it is set in ( Which is pretty good for a 25 episode long show). But I can\u00b4t give it a higher rating then 8, because a few episodes in the middle were kind of hard to watch in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said already, it really a great show. A strong contender for best summer 2016 anime. If you like fantasy anime, i recommend it to you. If you like some soft-core horror anime I would recommend this to you. If you like romance anime, yeah I guess it passes. Maybe there is an anime that gives you all this and even more, and it really loves you and respects you, but I love Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu.",

            "content": "Re:Zero truly wanted to be something. It shoots for the stars, it tries new things and throws the characters through so much torture and misery that the fantasy-world they are living in resembles more a hell. They boil in this hell, fuming with anger and regret, any shred of happiness they find fading almost immediately to nothing. \r\nBut Re:Zero isn't something. It reaches for its dear, dear life, but remains in the end wholly unremarkable shounen fare interested more in shocking the viewer with gore and theatrics than in telling a genuinely meaningful story. Re:Zero may not be terrible and irredeemable, but it certainly strugglesthroughout most of its twenty-five episodes to demonstrate that there is more to it than this. What is there in Subaru's tragic story that the audience can take with them at the end? What does it want to say? Not a whole lot, to be sure. Re:Zero is ambitious in mediocrity, notable only for its perverted sense of drama. \\n\\n\r\n(Minor spoilers will follow from here, as it is near-impossible to discuss an anime like this without revealing anything.)\\n\\n\r\nI have seen many people compare Re:Zero to Steins;Gate in the months since its airing. This is a great disservice to Steins;Gate. Where Steins;Gate spent nearly half its runtime developing the setting and its characters before asking the audience to empathise with and feel for them, Re:Zero does so immediately and does not ever ask for consent. It never develops its setting in any meaningful way-- about all you know for the duration of the story is that it is generic fantasy-land where people hate witches and bad things happen all the time-- and it throws death and gore at the viewer from the very first episode, when nobody even knows or cares about who Subaru is. It is shocking to see major characters die within the first episode, to be fair, but it no longer feels shocking the second, third or eleventh time. \\n\\n\r\nIf there was any consequence to these events, it is immediately brought to nothing by the show's contrived gimmick of rebirth and time-travel. It doesn't really matter if someone does die, as time will conveniently bend backwards for Subaru's sake-- never to the beginning, and always to the last major event in the story. There is no cost and no meaning to anything that happens. Subaru's mistakes are immediately erased upon rebirth, and he can go on about his day with nothing but his own guilt holding him back. He is the God of his story and the world is his playground. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Re:Zero does to compensate for this is killing its characters off in increasingly brutal ways. They will lose their limbs, be hacked to death by chains or tortured to the point where they no longer resemble a human being. It is violence without meaning, as artificial as can be, extreme and over-the-top to the point that it can almost at times resemble satire. Everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong for Subaru and friends, long before you are given any reason to care about their fates\u3000in the first place. The fifteenth episode is easily the biggest offender in this regard as it is nothing more than one massive slaughterfest, intent on making you feel bad for Subaru and his many waifus, him screaming in rage and gurgling on blood like it is some sort of torture porn. It is entirely possible for fiction to contain elements of death and gore without it negatively affecting the story, and in some cases it is even necessary, as it is for stories focused on issues such as war. Death is an entirely natural phenomenon, and humans are evidently not above committing acts such as murder. The issue with Re:Zero is that its death and gore exists for itself. It exists to shock and enrage the viewer, rather than serving as a product of the setting or as a vehicle for more substantial themes. For some people, this works, and throwing a character through a hurricane of awfulness is enough to instil sympathy. That's great, and I don't hold any ill will against these people. If anything, I am envious of how easily they can feel emotion. What actually bothers me is how effortless this method of storytelling truly is, and the audacity Re:Zero has to pretend it is something profound and on-par with film, as it did in the credits of the fifteenth episode. Re:Zero is visceral and sensually striking, and yet ever so empty. \\n\\n\r\n\"Empty\" can easily be used to describe the characters as well. Emilia, for example, exists as little more than a personification of the average anime fan's ideal woman, similar in many ways to Asuna from Sword Art Online, and lacking in any meaningful characterisation besides her occasionally getting upset at Subaru. It's even more baffling that Subaru chooses her in the world of romance when she has done very little to win over his affection or  help him, aside from giving him a place to stay for a couple days. She may as well not even exist-- the only reason she even does is to create more senseless tragedy for Subaru. \\n\\n\r\nRem and Ram are much better characters, as they actually have legitimate characterisation, backstory and development over the course of the story. The issue with them, particularly Rem, is that this development occurs so suddenly that it feels more like a complete change in character than an extension of who they really are. Rem  goes from hating Subaru's guts to being so completely in-love with him that she is willing to follow him to the ends of the Earth and sacrifice anything for his sake. To be fair, there is reason for this abrupt change in personality: Subaru is one of the only people who has ever shown her kindness, and he did so selflessly, on several occasions, without regard for his own safety. He does a great deal to win over her trust and respect. But the extent to which she loves him, especially when she was still cursing his name just a couple short episodes before, is so extreme that it feels less like a natural progression of her feelings and more a way to instil feelings of love in the viewer, to make her palatable to otaku, an ideal girlfriend of sorts, a \"waifu\" much as Emilia is. It is very hard to convince me that her feelings are anything more than a fleeting puppy-love when merely showing her a bit of kindness is enough to immediately turn Subaru from her most-hated person in the world to her most-cherished one. It feels fake-- it feels like a lie, as many things in Re:Zero are revealed to be.\\n\\n\r\nBetelguese, as creepy a bastard as he is, is by far one of the most obnoxious presences in the entire show. He is there, presumably, to create a sense of horror, as he will bend his body in unnatural ways, chew off his fingers in anger and bleed from his creepy little eyeballs, among other things. In reality, he is so loony and ridiculous that anything he says or does feels immediately silly, destroying any of the supposed horror he was supposed to generate. See, the thing most anime get wrong with horror (and indeed even most fiction in general) is that a truly terrifying character is not a raging lunatic, but rather someone totally ordinary and conscious of their actions. Hannibal Lecter is scary. Betelguese is anything but. If you want me to feel scared, do so in a way that resembles a reality humans can actually relate to, rather than a fantasy made of the likes of ghosts and goblins and bowl-cutted priests who eat their fingers for no reason. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the side characters are weak and one-dimensional as well, as they either serve as more empty harem material (with flat-out catgirls and lolis), are defined by a single-trait or  catchphrase (as Beatrice and Roswaal are), or are there as a weak attempt to instil more horror, like the stupid kid on the carriage (whose name I forget because I was too busy being angry at his annoying voice and how dumb the scene was) who completely breaks character and turns into a raging lunatic in another shallow attempt to push the story in a dark direction. The one main exception is Wilhelm, whose backstory and motivations truly do feel meaningful and justified. It is just a shame that he is immediately thrown to the benches again once this backstory reaches its quick end, serving afterwards as little more than some old dude who is skilled with the sword. \\n\\n\r\nThis leaves our buddy Subaru. I think, without exception, he is the factor that determines one's enjoyment of Re:Zero. If you can put up with his utter stupidity, you will find it possible to empathise with the trauma he goes through and his mental breakdowns that follow. If you are annoyed and disgusted with his presence (as I regularly was), it will be virtually impossible to care about most of what occurs. Subaru is the difference between being a fan of Re:Zero and being someone who actively dislikes it.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, he resembles a typical shounen hero. He is hot-headed, makes frequent out-of-place jokes (which I never once found funny, by the way), and refuses to ever think things through in a logical process, preferring instead to jump into battles he cannot win or to lash out at innocent people merely because his pride and fragile ego are called into question by his own mistakes. He thinks he is the coolest dude in the world, that he can save everyone through his own power, and the mere presence of someone with more skill than him offends him right to the very core. He yells and cries on a regular basis and seems incapable of having a normal conversation with anyone. Subaru is a child, and without any doubt one of the more infuriating characters I have witnessed in perhaps ever. There were points in the story where his characterisation legitimately made me angry and made me want to stop watching the show. Some moments were honestly baffling, too, such as how he switches from being completely mind-broken during the events of the fifteenth episode to being totally normal (albeit with a desire for revenge) in the next. \\n\\n\r\nI say all this, but the eighteenth episode is actually one of the best episodes of anime I have seen in quite some time. \\n\\n\r\nLet me explain. \\n\\n\r\nWhere the first two thirds of the anime spent its time showcasing unnecessary gore, Subaru's stupidity and empty characters who exist for little more than space on hug pillows and other creepy merchandise, the eighteenth episode redeems the anime and gives meaning to all that has happened, even if it doesn't erase its mistakes. It is an episode dedicated entirely to characterisation. It is a single conversation where Subaru shows remorse for his actions, recognising all the mistakes he has made and why he kept making them. He understands that he is a deeply flawed, broken person incapable of saving anyone or indeed even himself. It is at this moment that Subaru becomes aware of who he is. And you know what? I stopped hating him as a result, even if I still fundamentally disagreed with his actions and his character. He showed himself to be a human being for the first time in the entire story.\\n\\n\r\nI have great respect for scenes such as these. It's not often we get entire episodes dedicated to something as ordinary as a conversation. Re:Zero didn't need to use gore and death to identify its characters or make us care - it did so merely by giving Subaru a stage to speak. This leaves just one question: why didn't Re:Zero do this from the very beginning? \\n\\n\r\nIt's a bummer, as there was actually potential for a great anime. The pieces were there, and the writer and the staff behind the anime demonstrated that they had the talent to execute things in an effective and honest way. The music is excellent, complimenting Subaru's struggles without ever going overboard in sappy piano pieces and cacophonous orchestral pieces as many shows of its type tend to. Its visuals look totally fine, maintaining a consistent quality despite the longer-than-average episode count and abundant battle scenes, while the facial expressions, if occasionally a bit excessive, are undeniably effective at demonstrating the characters' pain and anguish. Re:Zero is very much a well-produced anime; you can tell that the people at White Fox truly wanted to create something special. \\n\\n\r\nI think this is why, even if I was bothered by most of the things I witnessed during my viewing of Re:Zero, I don't think it is a truly awful anime. It may not be a good one, not by any means-- its mistakes cannot be so easily erased-- but I do think its consistent effort and its eighteenth episode do at least redeem it to the extent of being a passable anime. It's why you see me giving Re:Zero a mediocre rating in my review rather than a poor one. I dislike much about Re:Zero, but for that one episode, I was a fan. \\n\\n\r\nI have a feeling I am in the minority here, as opinions on Re:Zero almost seem to be split into a dichotomy.  It is the best anime ever made for some, a life-changing adventure packed with emotion, and for the rest, it is a pile of irredeemable refuse aimed at the lowest-common denominator. To be perfectly fair, I am far more critical of Re:Zero than I am supportive of it. Its issues are certainly more numerous than its good points, and having one great episode can only take things so far when the other twenty-four vary from terrible to merely OK. But I'll be damned if I said it wasn't worth putting up with all the nonsense to get to that one point in the story. I just don't know if others are nearly as patient as I am, and I do have my doubts that future material will ever come close to that level of quality again.\\n\\n\r\nChances are, you'll have a better time with Re:Zero than I did. Many anime fans aren't looking for anything especially profound or complex in their entertainment, and I do not say that to be arrogant or dismissive. It is perfectly valid to watch anime for its entertainment value-- I do it as well, and so does just about anyone who is honest with themselves. \\n\\n\r\nBut this is a review and not a fan-piece. I am here to share my opinions and to judge the anime with a critical, yet fair eye. Re:Zero has a great deal of issues when viewed under these lenses, and none of them are insignificant. No matter how emotional its copious amounts of death and suffering made you, it would be quite hard to argue there is much more value to Re:Zero than its spectacle. It is a master at manipulating the audience's feelings, and while it succeeds at entertainment and has one special little moment, Re:Zero fails at making the case that it is anything more than lavishly produced, yet cheap theatre.\\n\\n\r\nThe question is, is that enough for you?\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't enough for me.",

            "content": "*This review contains light spoilers*\r\nFrom my perspective, we are living in a time where well crafted anime with a myriad of originality and detail are unfortunately being released at a frequently declining rate. Because of this, many in the anime community are constantly on the lookout for something new and creative. So naturally, when an anime like Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu airs, a show that boasts morbidly unique twists on the popular but overused fantasy/game world genre, it gains a lot of popularity and is generally well received in the anime community. However just because something is innovative doesn't mean that it is agood show overall. No, there are other characteristics, such as a detailed plot and a well developed cast, that can elevate a show from being simply different to something great. So is Re:Zero a great anime? I honestly believe that it is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd not just because there's a totally badass adorable maid in it who fulfills the desires of every man's heart (besides the romantically challenged main character who blatantly rejects her feelings for him. What a heartless monster).\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI never thought that any anime would be able to effectively combine dark psychological elements with an upbeat fantasy setting. However the genius behind Re:Zero, Tappei Nagatsuki, was able to expertly mix the two seemingly incompatible genres together, and the results are quite impressive. The show begins with our protagonist Natsuki Subaru getting suddenly transported to a fantasy world after leaving a convenience store. Being an otaku who has probably dreamed about something like this happening to him for years, Subaru is naturally excited to be in this new world. However, to his dismay, Subaru quickly learns that he doesn't have any special abilities or powers. Or so he thinks...anyway, he encounters the beautiful half elf Emilia when she saves him from a group of thugs. Thus the two of them start their adventure. This beginning seems quite clich\u00e9d, however everything changes dramatically when Subaru soon finds himself dead.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that was unexpected. The protagonist dies before the first episode even ends? Really? Well we soon learn that Subaru actually does possess a magical ability, called return from death. However this power only works when Subaru dies. When this skill activates, Subaru essentially travels back in time to a certain checkpoint to relive that part of his life in order to change it to a future in which he successfully completes a certain objective and lives. Being a fan of shows involving time traveling, I was excited to see where Nagatsuki was going with this, and I wasn't disappointed with the result.\\n\\n\r\nI was initially worried that Re:Zero would end up getting boring with the protagonist constantly failing and traveling back in time to relive the exact same scenarios over and over again. However with each new life, the progression of the story alters, sometimes dramatically, and many new elements are revealed to Subaru which were previously unknown that help him to solve the problems he faces and move on. This kept the anime fresh and exciting since something different happened with each life. Also, with every passing arc, Subaru's situation seemed to become substantially more dire, which lead to an increased intensity in the anime that kept me constantly entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOne negative aspect of the show that I've noticed is that Re:Zero seems to rely and focus on Subaru's ability a bit too heavily. This consistent emphasis on return from death takes away from other things, such as the detail revolving around the royal selection. This is seemingly an important plot point, but it is significantly overshadowed by the constant focus on Subaru and his continuous retakes at life. The anime spends an episode or two describing the royal selection and emphasizing its importance in relation to the characters only to practically drop it and hardly mention anything about it throughout the rest of the anime. There are some other similar occurrences present in Re:Zero as well. This resulted in the loss of plot points that could have made the anime more well rounded.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are very lovely. They are usually rather detailed, especially their facial expressions and features during moments when their faces are zoomed in on. Vibrant colors also help to bring the characters and scenery to life. Unfortunately, like many other shows in the industry, the animation dipped in quality as the anime progressed. The most notable example would be the fight scenes. Those showcased in the anime's initial episodes were highly detailed and well executed. However some of the later battles seemed more sloppy and not as well animated. Also, the CGI used on some background characters was utterly appalling. Luckily the use of CGI is very limited in this show. But hey, at least the female characters still maintained their lovely features throughout the entirety of the anime, and that's what really counts, right?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI was excited when I learned that Konomi Suzuki and Myth&Roid would be performing the theme songs for this anime since I enjoy music produced by both of them. Overall, I think that the theme songs are rather good, with my personal favorite being the first ending, Styx Helix, by Myth&Roid. The soundtrack was successful; it played upbeat and relaxing songs during lighthearted scenes and transitioned to dark and distorted themes during psychological moments. Subaru's seiyuu, Kobayashi Yuusuke, does an excellent job at vocally expressing the character's utter pain and misery through his voice acting talents.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, many of the characters in Re:Zero appear to fall into generic character categories. However as the anime progresses, the cast seems to evolve from their seemingly average state into much more dynamic, unique, and sometimes even lovable characters. \\n\\n\r\nSubaru surprisingly isn't some overpowered MC who can unexplainably beat every other character at practically everything. In fact, his only ability worth noting is return from death, which, while being extremely useful since it gives Subaru multiple chances at life, is the main source of his psychological trauma. Although he initially acts positive, Subaru slowly cracks and falls further into despair and insanity as the anime progresses. He is one of the few characters I've seen that, for the most part, actually acts like a real life human would in the dark situations that he finds himself in. Of course, this may mean that you'll want to punch him in the face sometimes when he acts all cowardly, stupid, and obnoxious, but you have to understand what the poor guy is going through. Plus he redeems himself in the later portion of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEmilia is a beautiful, kind, and lovable girl; in other words, the type that many view as great waifu material. However the thing that I like most about her is the fact that she, unlike so many other female characters like her, can actually live WITHOUT the male lead. During one point she actually decides that it's best for her and Subaru to go there separate ways. I find this to be rather admirable, since it shows that Emilia can be an independent person who doesn't need to rely on others. There's not much else to say about her since she hardly gets any screen time in the second half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nRem surprised me the most out of all of the characters. In fact, I believe that she's much more developed than the \"main girl,\" Emilia, and is simply a superior character. The first few times that we see Rem, she humorously makes fun of Subaru with the assistance of her sister Ram. However as the story progresses, we get to learn so much more about Rem. I don't want to spoil any particular moments, but I will say that she has a badass yandere mode where she slaughters practically everything with her spiked mace in an epic fashion. Rem also develops feelings for Subaru, who she becomes admirably loyal to and saves numerous times, that lead to some really adorable moments between the two. Rem is also super cute and she just looks stunning, especially when she smiles. The sexy maid outfit is also a plus. Re:Zero really showcases a rare gem in Rem, who is the best anime character that I've seen in awhile.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero also boasts a strong supporting cast. This group of characters includes the cute and sarcastic maid Ram, the adorable and magical loli Beatrice, and the utterly insane and slothful antagonist Petelgeuse. While obviously not as much as the lead cast, many of these characters receive adequate development and possess unique personality traits that make them more likable and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show combines the best aspects of different genres to create something that is very entertaining to watch. It has fun characters and settings that kept me entertained. I was constantly on the edge of my seat in excitement hoping for Subaru to succeed and tensely waiting to see the repercussions of his failures. Cliffhangers were effectively used at the end of multiple episodes that left me craving more, though they were a bit excessive. While some episodes focused on dialogue and lacked any \"excitement,\" I still enjoyed watching them because they helped to flesh out the characters and gave me valuable insight on the characters' emotions, thoughts, etcetera. My main issue is that I feel like the anime peeked at around episode 15, and while the latter half of Re:Zero remained pretty good, it didn't quite reach the level of greatness that the mid episodes had. Nonetheless, this was definitely an entertaining anime from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6/10\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero impressed me. This anime wasn't afraid to take an overused idea and combine it with a myriad of originality that resulted in a very well produced show. While there are some minor errors (then again, what show doesn't have any flaws?), Re:zero managed to succeed at being both an unique and a well executed anime. This is a show that I would most certainly recommend watching.",

            "content": "\"The only thing worse than dying once is having to die again.\"\r\nThat was the title of a wonderful email from Crunchyroll I received about a month and a half ago to advertise \"Re: Zero - Starting Life in another World -\". I ignored it at first, and simply carried on with my two shows of the season, Jojo Part 4 and Mob Psycho 100 (both of which I heartily recommend you watch). However, after a little while of my friends pestering me to watch this series, I sat down and put the first half of the first episode onto my TV.\r\nRe: Zero starts off somewhatstereotypically. A somewhat clueless teenager is mysteriously dragged into a parallel world through means unexplained whilst browsing a convenience store. My initial thoughts were similar to that of Sword Art Online, which made me immediately assume that this series may go in the same direction, with pointless character arcs and questionable writing.\\n\\n\r\nOh my was I completely wrong.\\n\\n\r\nOur main lead is the endearing Natsuki Subaru, a teenage shut-in with initially very little character. Upon arriving in this new world, he comes to meet the silver-haired girl \"Satella\", who claims she is looking for something she recently had stolen from her. After Subaru agrees to help her, they wind up at the city slums... Where they are both brutally murdered.\\n\\n\r\nIt is at this point, Subaru returns back where he started. Initially believing he dreamt up the scenario, he runs back towards the slums to meet with Satella, where after certain events... He is murdered again.\\n\\n\r\nHere is where Re: Zero starts to really shine. Subaru has the power to, as he names it, \"Return by Death\", where upon dying he returns back to a previous point in his time where he is safe to try things over again. Everyone he met during his last \"life\" forgets him, and only what he has achieved before he \"resets\" remains. However, Subaru remembers. He remembers all the times he's been killed, everything he may have experienced and everything that everyone he's met has no memory of.\\n\\n\r\nRe: Zero looks in-depth at the effect this has on his mental state, which can lead it into the realms of being a psychological thriller. And it achieves representing Subaru's mind absolutely perfectly, in such a way that it's hard to sum up in words. The viewer feels everything Subaru feels, his shock and awe, his confusion, his sudden realisations, as well as his happiness when eventually, everything turns out just OK.\\n\\n\r\nThe show presents Subaru as more than anything else, being very human. He reacts to situations in a way you'd expect, and to some viewers, in that way that they would. That's not to say Subaru is the only character that gets developed. Other characters that are met later in the story have their own short arcs that link in with their backstory, even if it's one moreso than any of the others.\\n\\n\r\nRe: Zero absolutely nails it's presentation of each episode. Each episode flows naturally, sometimes not including the show's OP and ED for extra effect (which on a side note helps to make the show very nice to marathon). Each episode ends with a \"title screen\" as such, of the episode's title, and why this may not seem like a big deal, it's small things like this that help to keep the show's atmosphere working, whether it's a happy sigh of relief, or a grim potential future rearing its head.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has two Openings and two Endings, all of which work well with the arc they air in. The first OP \"Redo\" by Konomi Suzuki is a visual spectacle, with flashy effects and hidden meanings that become more obvious as the show continues, all while giving a good grasp on what exactly Re: Zero may contain for people going in with no prior knowledge of the show's events. The second OP, \"Paradisus - Paradoxum\" by MYTH&ROID, while not as visually stunning as the first OP, has a chaotic nature to it that perfectly captures the feel of the arc it airs in. The first ED, \"STYX HELIX\", also by MYTH&ROID works well when played during an ending scene, however has little effect for the viewer when played by itself (though it's still a great song). The final ED, \"Stay Alive\" is performed by Rei Takahashi, the VA for \"Satella\", and like the ED before it, works far better when played during an ending scene. The show's two insert songs, \"STRAIGHT BET\" and \"theater D\" (both my MYTH&ROID) both work FABULOUSLY with the scenes they play in for bonus points.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is anywhere to fault the show, it is on it's character development \"priorities\" so to speak. A few of the side characters introduced appear to be getting developed at some stages, however never seem to get the equal treatment that some of the other side characters do. Aside from this, at times the character animation can seem somewhat sloppy, however thankfully this is very rare and never during prominent moments.\\n\\n\r\nTo end things off, Re: Zero - Starting Life in another World - is very much a spectacle - one that will keep you on your toes, make you smile, make you cry in despair and most certainly, one not to miss. Special mention for the show's main villain, who while being animated perfectly for his kind of character, also has an undoubtedly wonderful VA (that being the wonderful voice of Yoshitsugu Matsoka) who really nails the \"insane\" feel around the character.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.4/10\\n\r\nArt: 8.4/10\\n\r\nSound: 9.8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Re: Zero a rating of 9.8 out of 10, with my own guideline of to watch it immediately if you haven't already. The series is available for legal streaming on Crunchyroll.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a series that likes to play with your heart and mind like a fiddle, this may be the perfect series for you. Enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWOAH, EDIT TIME!\\n\r\nHey, this review's kinda on the old side now, and while I don't think R:Z is a perfect 10/10 show now, it's still a very solid watch for those that love Isekai or anime with darker themes.",

            "content": "Hi all, this is my first review on MAL. Please bare with me, but I feel like I should share my opinion on this and why I gave it the score I did. I wouldn't say I'm the most hardcore anime fan, but I have definitely seen my fair share of shows and am pretty much a typical anime viewer. I review anime in my mind pretty differently than others. Note, there may be a lot of extra information that is unneeded for this review, but I really want to put my perspective on this as much as possible. If you don't care, just scrolldown to the three hyphens.\\n\\n\r\nJust to get things out of the way: this score deserves a 10 not necessarily for its metrics per se, but for the fact that for people who like anime in general it is a show that needs to be seen.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm sick and tired of lately, which will probably never be stopped, is reviewers or fans comparing shows to other shows. It's a huge anime circlejerk that people are really adamant about. Honestly, it could be said about a lot of things. Video games are a very good example, but that's for another time.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start off with my initial reaction. I usually pick a few shows to watch each season and continue from there. When I watched the trailer, I was immediately reminded of KonoSuba. It wasn't off putting, but I was just surprised to see an almost identical setting so soon. Of course, people are using 'isekai' as a description, but I never really heard of that until recently. Where a character gets transported into a world, etc...\\n\\n\r\nI ended up only watching the first half of the hour long opening due to time constraints and it was kind of a \"whatever\" show to me. Big mistake. I took this for granted and ended up with friends on social media blabbering about the show weeks later. Around episode 14 or so.\\n\\n\r\nI asked one of my good friends, who I'd actually say is pretty hardcore into anime (he's been using MAL for years and has a very strict rating guideline and watches almost every show that releases), what the concept of the show was. Remember, I didn't bother to look into this show at all. He basically just told me what happened at the end of the second half of the season premiere and I totally regretted my decision that night. I'm a sucker for that device- being able to start again or go into the past. I may have a bias on that genre (please don't look at my favorite shows... :) ), but this show executes it very well. I ended up binge watching until 15 and it was totally worth it. Since then, I've been trying to make the first thing I do every Sunday morning is watch Re:Zero.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBeginning with the story; it is wide and vast, but at its core a very deep, and emotional heart string puller. I'll say it here: I read a bit of the web novel a few weeks ago because my mind could not wait. I do like to spoil myself sometimes, but that's exactly what this show made me do. I did the same with Erased, and Shingeki no Kyojin. Why? Because there was so much information I wanted to know that I feel like the show could not explain with a few episodes left. And albeit it is disheartening that they exclude some crucial information regarding characters or story, it does not take it away from the show at all. That's why I said it is wide and vast.\\n\\n\r\nAt initial glance, it seems as a very typical \"otaku/neet character gets transported into a different world...\" (as mentioned earlier), but it gives it a twist with strong character development along the way, which I will explain later. Being able to \"start again from zero\" is a common trend recently, but I honestly will never get tired of it. We all wish to be able to time travel or start things over, and it fills my need by watching these shows. This executes the concept incredibly well. It's hard to talk about the story without the characters, because they really are the backbone than the story rather than the lore of the world. \\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist is Natsuki Subaru, and it's very much his story. I hate him. I hate him a lot. Many people actually do, but it's not a bad thing. Why do we hate him? Because he makes horrible decisions and does things we do not want, at all. He is...very real. Many viewers and other anime fans like characters who have crazy magic powers, look super cool, wields some badass sort, or something along those lines.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing special about Subaru. He's definitely no Sora from No Game No Life. He also didn't have the luxury Kazuma Satou (KonoSuba) had being able take Aqua with him and join a guild/get a job.\\n\\n\r\nWe hate this guy. He's a crybaby and practically useless. However, that is what drives this show. We get to see him evolve into a better person. He treats his adventure like a game, and gets punished for it. We realize the struggle he goes through, and that is what we would go through if we were transported into a world like that. We play it off like a game that we see or know, but it's not a game, it's very real.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru doesn't start off as some overpowered character that can trump the bad guys or continuously one-up them. He literally dies- over and over again. And he still doesn't learn his lesson until he deals with love. The love for Emilia. When it gets that deep, we're already attached. He'll do anything for her, and makes us feel the same way. Also, he doesn't automatically attract this \"harem\" that people seem to think he has. He earns it. He gave up blood and sanity to learn these people and they became a part of his life in this world.\\n\\n\r\nFor 25 episodes, we don't see the finish line straight ahead, but we wish we could see the course from above. Obstacles have been overcome, but there are a more to come, and some block in the roads as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are many characters to love in this show, hell, Rem is already tons of people's waifu. What makes her that though? Her personality and determination is what all of us want, but not Subaru. She is everything to him, yet he stays faithful to Emilia. A lot of fans also have this as a reason to hate him; rejecting the perfect girl for someone who doesn't even feel the same way for him.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the fun if everything went the way you wanted? Of course- that's what we want in our heads, but not doing what we want creates tension, which is completely fine for this kind of genre. The last thing you want to think about is that it is a silly harem/comedy. It really isn't. It has twists, turns, loops, you shouldn't be wanting something, you should be wanting to know what direction is coming ahead.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the cast in general. It's great, just like I rated it. It's hard to find a perfect set, but they're close to being one. Everyone that gets air time, for the most part, has a developed background and importance in the show. They all mesh well together and have some sort of connection to Subaru. Characters that simply might be thought of \"side characters\", may have more than a meaning than you think. The feeling this show makes when Subaru gets so close to someone and have them dying off, and seeing them in a different timeline alive again is eerie as hell. You feel the realization that they were just dead- you became really close to them, and now you are back at the point where you just met them. There are some characters who get a decent amount, but are still unexplained in the show, but will be eventually...hopefully.\\n\\n\r\nYou want to look through the eyes of Subaru when looking at the cast, since this is his story. There are people you are going to hate and it's perfectly acceptable, because Subaru hates them as well. The same goes for being attached. That's why this is such a great cast. And People hating Subaru? That is fine too, because he shows that he truly hates himself throughout the entirety of the show. He wants to do better and you want him to do better, but keeps doing worse, and worse. He then realizes his faults, and so do we. When he develops, we develop.\\n\\n\r\nPeople would say, why wouldn't he just do or say this? We need to realize that he portrays a neet or otaku and thinks it's a game. He thinks he can get away with what he knows about that culture, but is completely wrong. His method and thinking is not the same as ours watching. Being there is entirely different and that's the way he went through with it. He thinks he's Kirito, but obviously he's just a random neet stuck in a fantasy world. He doesn't have good social skills. He's awkward and cringey.\\n\\n\r\nBut his willingness to learn and his determination he promised since episode 1 is what makes him strong. He does get it over his head, way over his head, but he learns and realizes his mistakes, which makes him an amazing character. Not many characters these days accept their faults and mistakes. They're just already the best person in the universe and can overcome anything. We see why Subaru is able to do that in the end.\\n\\n\r\nI can go over the other main characters or lead support characters just as much as Subaru, but I'm just going to shorten it here and say that Emilia is the X-Factor of the show. She pretty much preemptively decided Subaru's fate. I mean, she IS the main female protagonist. Rem and Ram help build his character, and I say this in the least descriptive way possible to keep this review shorter so I don't bore you with reading. They are the main support characters. And to make it generic, they support him pretty damn well.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, they beat him up (both mentally and physically), but he learns and builds from it. Every character he has a moment with is important to him. He learns to use his past knowledge about people to help him get through the world. They're not just people to him. As mentioned, at first, he completely naive, and we hate it, but we should stay in our seat and watch as his flaws become traits.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNo need to get into too much detail about this. The design and visuals great, but the random CG background characters really take it away from me to be honest. Like especially when there are drawn background characters mixed in with CG background characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs aren't anything to be in awe about. I mean, Subaru is in a track suit for Christ's sake. Emilia's outfit is cute, Rem and Ram are just in kind of skimpy maid outfits. I do like the outfits the knights have.\\n\\n\r\nThe settings and locations are incredible though, like the city, mansion, forest, and open fields. Great variety colors. I'm not too keen on art, but in the end, it's all great except the super obvious CG.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe background, fighting, and setting music aren't really memorable to me, but they're not bad whatsoever. There wasn't a time where I felt as if the music was off or anything, so it was just fitting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the openings and endings I really enjoyed. At first I thought the second opening song was a little odd, but it really grew on me and I actually ended up wanting to watch the opening every time it came on, so that's good new. Myth & Roid is cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ending is fantastic. Like, when the episode would end and that song would play without the actual ending being played. It's kind of a slow and sad sounding song, so during intense moments it really brought out my emotions even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, oh let me get started on the voice acting. So there's this bad guy named Petelgeuse/Betelgeuse. Just look up some clip and try to guess who the voice actor without looking him up.\\n\\n\r\n-Yeah, it's Matsuoka. The guy who voices Sora, Soma, and Kirito. He does an AMAZING job differentiating his normal tone and voice. Even Subaru's voice actor does a breathtaking job. You can feel the anger, angst, and struggle with his voice. He's portraying an insane villain and has some crazy lines and phrases that are unforgettable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nUh, maybe by this review and its score you can tell if I enjoyed it or not. :) I binged this show like 15 episodes straight and was wanting more every week. I could probably say I enjoyed it, a little. It's a ride that I want to keep staying on. Ups, downs, loops, turns, jumps, you name it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWith the individual scores, it comes to about a 95%, which I rounded up to a 10/10. So in actuality, this show is a 9.5. Absolutely nothing wrong with that.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the only thing I would have to say is that I'd only recommend this show for people who have already watched a few shows already. I wouldn't say it's a good first show to watch if you're just new into anime, as good as it is. You kind of need to have background knowledge of other shows. Even though I say not to compare, but to just be aware and see the difference it really has to other shows, or that it takes in different aspects and genres to create this wonderful show.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys.",

            "content": "Ahh, the reviewer. The first line of defense to quell the flames of irrational thought and often the bearer of bad news for those of the general public. They're the Buzz Killingtons that take it upon themselves to blow the \"no fun\" whistle and send the partygoers back on the hype-train that they rode in on. It's a thankless job, one that doesn't reward anyone besides the smug satisfaction of the man with the whistle, tipping his top hat and waving \"adieu\" at the fanbase, outraged that someone had the audacity to bring an analytical lens to the \"totally bitchin party, bruh!\"\r\nAnd as the seasonallineup ends and the hype-train chugs on to the next destination to start the cycle all over again, the reviewer, Mr. Buzz Killington, slaps his final verdict in the form of a nasty wall of diatribes, as he carries on his endless crusade to educate would-be viewers, one party foul at a time. \\n\\n\r\nNow, before I go any further, I'd like to put all my chips on the table. I don't plan to campaign for Re:Zero's public standing, nor will I bastardize its name for the sake of winning the appeal of dissenters. What will be written from here on out is simply one man stating his viewpoint. If that means dispensing the full-range of my vocabulary like a snobby know-it-all, then so be it. As long as my assessment is clearly understood, whether you choose to sling mud at my remarks or practice diplomacy is of no concern to me. \\n\\n\r\nAnd without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, weeaboos and pseudo-elites, I, ZephSilver, will serve as your Buzz Killington for the evening, as we take a tour through anime's latest mistake, Re:Zero, or as I like to call it, Re:packaged goods. \\n\\n\r\nWrithing in pain it doesn't understand, with paint-by-number personalities that desperately try to express it, Re:Zero is a gaudy, yet entertaining, blowhard that stumbles upon an ingenious formula for mainstream success. In a cynically calculated ruse, Re:Zero combines snippets of set-pieces from other works to create a Frankenstein that's built to be a surefire hit, regardless of how much manipulation is required to keep the circus act up. By capitalizing on the ever-increasing demand for MMORPG inspired settings, time-travel narratives and well... a gratuitous amount of shock value, it captures the general populace's attention with ease. And really, who could fault it? The anime industry has within its grasp a foolproof method to gain the public's ear. A method that's figured out, down to a science, thanks to countless trial and error. It just so happens that this 'foolproof' method is predicated on sales and popularity, whether it receives critical acclaim or not is secondary. Dangling its bait right after the success of works with similar setups, it was inevitable that many would bite. Re:Zero offered many fan-favorite arrangements all in a convenient, one-stop package: a smorgasbord of goodies to satisfy a wide range of palates. And if that wasn't enough to seal the deal, it marketed a premise that potentially subverted the MMORPG formula into something dark and decrepit, capturing any stragglers that might have avoided the bait in disinterest with the promise of something \"re:freshing.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe rest was simply a matter of word of mouth. The match was lit, and all that was left was to sit back and watch the wildfire burn. With viewers exalting Re:Zero as \"smart,\" \"bold,\" and \"enthralling,\" ignoring this show's existence became nigh impossible. An anime that was built to be popular. An anime that was predestined to become the centerpiece discussion of every anime-related thread during its run. A wonderful monstrosity concocted in a lab by a board of executives, perfecting their latest endeavor to siphon money out of people's pockets, without so much as making the intent noticeable. I know we all want to hold an optimistic view on this situation but I advise that we take a step back before purchasing the snake oil. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is to White Fox what Kabaneri was to Wit studio: a proven investment, disingenuous or not. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, think about it for a moment. What were White Fox's most successful outings so far? Akame Ga Kill, a show about gruesome deaths in a medieval fantasy world, riddled with the underpinnings of political intrigue, a setup that deviated from typical shounen fodder, and a broad range of colorful personalities that inhabited its universe. And Steins;Gate, a show about time-travel being used to save your loved ones after a conspiracy was discovered, forcing the protagonist to revisit key events to find the best path to save everyone. Putting aside how you may feel about those shows individually, the fact remains that Re:Zero meshes these two appeals in a fashion that seems far too perfect to be simply a case of coincidence.\\n\r\nWhen you look back at the shows that garnered the most attention in the last handful of years, how could you not feel that Re:Zero is a product of the machine? There's being at the right place at the right time, and then there's simply casting your fishing line after analytical charts and focus groups indicate that the waters are ripe with hungry prey.\\n\\n\r\nSo after stating all this, it may surprise you to know that I fully recommend this show to anyone that confronts me about it. Why may you ask? Well, to be honest, it's pretty entertaining. Whatever my stance may be regarding the title, it cannot be denied that the show is easily digestible. With plot twists at every turn, bloody fatalities being dished out at a moments notice, and cliffhangers guaranteeing your return for more, Re:Zero is a binge-worthy viewing experience. However, my reasons for full-heartedly endorsing the show are probably not the reasons that the creators would probably like. For now, just hold on to that thought, we'll discuss why later.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that long-winded preface out of the way, it's time to continue our tour. \\n\\n\r\nStepping out of a convenience store in modern day Japan and being transported to a medieval fantasy world for no more reason than the writers saying, \"We need to start the story somehow,\" our main protagonist, Suburu, enters Capital City; the epicenter of commerce for this foreign land of Lugunica and the place that would mark his burial ground on several occasions to come. After he comes in contact with a mysterious silver-haired girl named Emilia, he finds himself caught up in a web of deceit, hidden mysteries behind every corner and a bad case of groundhogs day that's marked with the end of his life. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so goes the rest of his journey, constantly being respawned at key locations similar to game save checkpoints until he conquers a life-threatening obstacle. Death, birth, repeat. A rat churning cream to avoid drowning and hoping its efforts would create butter, allowing for solid ground to escape its entrapment. Some might refer to this as \"torture porn\" or a snuff film in animated form. And while I might find these sentiments to be a bit overstated, I still can't help but feel like there's an underlying truth to that way of thinking. \\n\r\nThere's always a feeling that gnaws away at your subconscious when you watch the show. Something that many viewers may not be able to pinpoint but that they know is there, like the nuisance of a small object stuck in the sole of your shoe or a lingering thought that's just out of reach. I believe this feeling derives from the way the show presents its ideas. Themes that are supposed to be profound but end up taking on a whole new meaning when highlighted in neon lights and announced over a loudspeaker. \\n\\n\r\nSuburu doesn't just die; he's butchered in the most gratuitous way imaginable. A newly gained tactical advantage isn't just implemented; instead, it's buffered through excessive expository dialogue. Character arcs don't just happen naturally; they're highlighted with drastic presentation changes and streams of confetti. In the words of Urban Dictionary, Re:Zero has no chill. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero falls victim to sensationalizing things that it thinks would be considered poignant, as is the case with most shows that are said to 'subvert' the formula they're a part of. And by doing so, it indirectly counteracts that notion. A narcissistic protagonist being humbled by the realization that life doesn't revolve around him isn't a great revelation if the show goes out of its way to constantly point it out. Being mentally exhausted from the toll of dying constantly isn't eye-opening if the show literally has to tell you it is. Subtext ceases to hold meaning if the creators have a habit of making its intent obvious. This is the problem that many high-strung shows have, where they don't trust the viewer to pick up on the clues themselves. 2001: A Space Odyssey wouldn't be praised as a sci-fi classic if it had its ideas being pointed out with Blue's Clues paw prints. Se7en wouldn't be a great mystery/thriller had Dora the Explorer show up as a movie guide. Point being, good subtextual content is only good if the creators don't over-extend their control over how easy it's discovered. \\n\\n\r\nLike Erased from winter 2016, Re:Zero's attempts at something far beyond it only backfires when this issue plagues every facet of its existence. It's trying to be symbolic; it's trying to interweave motifs; it's trying to create intrigue; it's trying to tinker with psychology... but, it's doing so in the most ham-fisted way possible. It fully rejects the idea of subtlety in every aspect imaginable, instead choosing to holler everything in an ostentatious display that's borderline masturbatory. A premature celebration of its accomplishments that's mired in the stench of hubris. \\n\\n\r\nSetting tone and forcing tone aren't the same things. You can't give birth to natural reactions by simply pumping your content full of steroids to make it blossom faster. Anything worth having should come to fruition on its own merits through the course of the narrative. Re:Zero is simply too impatient for proper grooming, and as a result, we get villains that are essentially godforsaken hybrids of the Joker, Batman V Superman's Lex Luther, and the wacky waving inflatable tube men located outside of used car dealerships, snacking on their fingers like crispy chicken tenders. We get characters that deviate from common anime tropes to simply fall victim to yet another trope instead. Re:Zero's biggest enemy is itself, a show that can't be subdued even if it comes at the cost of its own integrity. \\n\r\nBut what about the people that don't see these issues? What about those who are genuinely enthralled by Re:Zero's efforts? Those who, despite the obvious blare of \u2018trying-too-hard\u2019 fireworks, don't pick up on the show's underlying meaning until further inspection? What about the people who push the agenda of the show being \"smart,\" \"bold,\" and \"enthralling?\" The foot soldiers that perpetuate the show's self-worth, finding depth where others see beyond it? Surely they're not mistaken. What do they see that others don't? As it turns out, the real question isn't what they see, but what they choose to give the show credit for. \\n\\n\r\nIt's the interesting themes that Re:Zero flirts with throughout its narrative. The outer shell that masquerades as in-depth concepts. If there's no prior contact with the ideas that Re:Zero presents, this kind of perception is easy to understand. First exposure to something that insinuates a deeper layer could cause any viewer to wax philosophical. And there lies the difference: those that have seen the laminated copy, as well as the genuine article. When the same concepts are seen done right, suddenly that laminated copy starts to become all the more noticeable. And so is the case with Suburu's supposedly \"broken psyche.\"\\n\\n\r\nLike the case for Gakkougurashi of summer 2015, another show proclaimed as a 'deconstruction' of its genre, Re:Zero also takes pleasure in tinkering with delirium, but refuses to dive truly into it. It glorifies the main character's mental breakdown, turning it on and off at the whims of the scriptwriters. With something as easy as a pep talk and hug from LoveInterest#2 being all that's needed to make things better, it's really hard to justify the \"psychology\" that Re:Zero boasts about.\\n\\n\r\nWant to truly show a mentally broken state? Then have the line between past existence and current life be obscured with each reincarnation, and don't fix it. Just imagine how amazing it would be if the memories of all respawned events were compressed upon each rebirth, to the point where Suburu is no longer aware of the difference between them. It would truly demonstrate the anguish that Suburu suffers through by making the consequence something that's not only visual for the viewer but also something that implies that deeper layer that the show so desperately seeks to obtain. Instead of simply being the laminated copy, it could have been like other animated works that truly dive deep into this concept, such as Satoshi Kon's Millennium Actress and Perfect Blue. Both featured films containing women who slowly lose their minds and grips on reality as they descend further into a fever dream of delirium and jumbled memory. It didn't just carry around psychology like some fashion accessory, but it made it a very real thing for the viewers looking on and the characters that took the plunge into the never-ending spiral of irrational flatlining. \\n\r\nSee that the protagonist suffers a loss that he can't simply fix with a jump off a cliff. Have stakes. If respawning to checkpoints is the only way to advance the narrative, the very least the creators could do would be to place Suburu at the crossroad of a decision that would allow advancement only if someone else were to perish. Let there be permanent blood on his hands, not just a never-ending clean slate. Don't resolve psychological trauma like it's just some phase people get over after a few days. Don't just wave around psychology like it's a toy. People don't simply undo damage because the plot demands a rational mind in a given scenario. This shouldn't change even for Suburu. Embrace it fully. Let go of safety nets if you truly want something that's \"deep\" and not just another copy of something other creators (Satoshi Kon) have proven is possible to achieve. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really, this is just covering one aspect the show chooses to claim as its own. The same level of commitment is expected for every aspect of Re:Zero, not just some half-assed effort. With these nebulous concepts about redefining a protagonist's importance and exposing inner truths that felt entirely too heady for something as simple-minded as Re:Zero to muster up in any meaningful way, the only chance that the other half that doesn't see the show as \"smart,\" \"bold,\" and \"enthralling\" could buy into it, is if the show stops trying to find compromise that's easy to live with. It may seem \"smart,\" but it does so with an air of smarminess while also over-pronouncing its efforts. It may seem \"bold,\" but it never takes any risks that could be seen as irreversible. It may seem \"enthralling\" for advocates, but for everyone else on the other side of the aisle, it's just dumb schlock-entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if there was anything that made this half-ass commitment more apparent, it would have to be the presentation that it was given. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is that kid that just learned a new 3-syllable word and just spews it out at every opportune moment in a sad attempt to appear intellectual. There're some elements here that demonstrate some semblance of writing chops, I would give the show that, but the way the writers flaunt their ability to come up with said ideas comes off as conceited, especially when these moments wallow in content that's tantamount to idiotic orchestral displays. It's a proud peacock, flaunting its ideas, while strutting around with toilet paper stuck to its ass. As it navel-gazes, everyone else looks on in amusement. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I said it points things out with neon lights, this is what I mean. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cHey, the camera is shaking excessively. Hey, we're giving Suburu a manic expression, one step away from having him foaming at the mouth. Hey, we literally added a 10% darkness opacity filter to Suburu's color scheme. Hey, all of these scene compositions literally bathe Suburu in a constant shadow. Hey, his eyes are big and bulgy. HEY, HEY, HEY!! Do you get it yet!? Hey, are our actions to paint him in an obscure light after a big altercation with Emilia not made clear yet? Please reward us. Please tell us we're smart. I learned a 3-syllable word today! Please applaud my efforts!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nEvil can't be expressed without outlandishly warped expressions. Happiness can't be felt without copious amounts of animated tears, a gust of wind, and painted on blushes. Insanity can't be expressed without darkened eye bags, manic expressions, and rape faces. Everything is calculated. A stage play executed with no blemishes. A play that remains a play. Art that imitates the art of others. Re:Zero wants to be a real boy, but its growing wooden nose tells the truth it doesn't want to admit to itself. If the warped face of anger looks forced, then guess what: it's forced. If the happy moments felt a bit too inflated with random rose peddles flying around and kawaii-level faces, then guess what: it's inflated. If sadness felt unauthentic with instantaneous waterworks and elastic expressions at the drop of a hat, then guess what: it's unauthentic. You're not interpreting it wrong. That pang in the back of your head that tells you this is kinda overkill isn't \"just you.\" Deep down you know what you're seeing is over exaggerated, and after time has settled and you reminisce about key events, that would become clearer than ever. Re:Zero is a novelty act that blinds you with flurries of action and plot twists, but the moments the spectacle is over, what would remain is the realization that what you held dear was nothing more than snake oil sold by a quick-witted businessman. \\n\\n\r\nEven things like auditory cues can't help but feel like the show signaling excessively to get your attention, an example being a high pitched hum, like angelic beings from a choir taking a laxative-laced shit. It could be seen as \"chilling\" to some, or you could be like me and think it's the angels of heaven passing a kidney stone in orchestic unison. Point being it's played only to signal a disturbance. And seeing that the show is all about disturbances, it just ends up exacerbating a problem that didn't need any more highlighting than it was already getting. \\n\\n\r\nWhat needed more attention, however, were the characters and environment that the story took place in. For a show that's supposed to be genre defining, it does very little to prove it. \\n\\n\r\nWe get characters whose defining personality trait is being a loli with a speaking habit, I suppose. Beatrice and the rest of the loli cast could fuck off, I suppose. But I suppose since half of Re:Zero's main cast is lolis, getting rid of them would leave very little, I suppose. Stereotypical roles don't suddenly become better by simply switching them to another stereotypical role. A visual novel maid character doesn't gain depth by making her \u201cwaifu-bait\u201d contestants. And this extends to every other character Suburu comes across on his journey. They're all just there to fill in expected roles, like a bunch of NPCs that are brought to life.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no sense of culture. No ethos to pull from. Nothing that defines the world that Suburu is tossed into. Just snippets of ideas cobbled together to serve as yet another medieval fantasy world that draws from the same well as any other. Were Re:Zero the only anime to tackle high fantasy, this wouldn't be a problem, but sadly for it, Escaflowne exists. Rage of the Bahamut exists. Berserk(1997) exists. Moribito exists. There's nothing here that defines Re:Zero. Even trainwrecks like Akame Ga Kill had a better-thought-out universe. And for whatever it does try to establish, it's either extremely overbearing or missing things that could be attributed to half-assed resolve. To go into specific cases would require spoiling some events, so join me in the spoiler section to go over them if you've already seen the show. As for everyone else, skip past for final thoughts. \\n\\n\r\n**** brief spoilers****\\n\r\n(scroll down to avoid)\\n\\n\r\nNaita Aka Oni (The Red Ogre who Cried), is a popular Japanese children tale that teaches kids the cost of assimilation and what it means for loved ones left behind to gain it. This is shown with a red and a blue ogre. Re:Zero attempted to use this story to insinuate the relationship shared between Ram and Rem. But like everything else that the show highlights unnecessarily, this parallel drawn was also made blatantly obvious, with Ram and Rem's hair color being pink and blue, which obviously alluded to the red and blue ogres, respectively. This wouldn't have been a big deal had they kept it at just that, but like I've already stated, the show doesn't trust its audience to pick up on the subtext implied. Instead, we get the arc with the inclusion of both sisters being superimposed with a symmetrical balance of pink and blue at every turn. It beats you over the head with the symbolism it's trying to present. This also included Suburu stating to the sisters that they're \u201cfanatical like demons\u201d with their reactions indicative to their origin as literal demons. It's this kind of obviousness that shows like Erased demonstrate when they highlighted everything in red to insinuate danger. Attempts at cleverness that's just painfully juvenile. And now this same kind of forcefulness is being carried over to Re:Zero. \\n\\n\r\nAnd 17-minutes into episode 11, Suburu states, \"You know, Rem, you keep putting Ram on a pedestal and undermining yourself\u2014,\" while the camera unapologetically focuses on blue and pink flowers, both literally sitting in a vase (pedestal) of equal height. These are the kinds of things that Re:Zero does repeatedly that demonstrate its lack of restraint. Constantly drawing attention to your symbolism only defeats the purpose of it, to begin with. Symbolism and motifs alike are supposed to be discovered, not spoon-fed. And this is the problem with this show: it can't simply let things be without intervening with forceful resolve. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then you have ideas that are used only to add detail to the universe or serve as a new plot reveal to keep the story exciting, but that are never properly thought out. \\n\\n\r\nLike the battle against Moby Dick, a beast with the ability to erase the memory of people's existence consumed by its fog. We get an example of this when Rem sacrifices herself to save Suburu and is immediately forgotten by everyone who knows her. But yet, when this incident occurs again during the heat of battle against a battalion in episode 20, the powers don't work the same way. Where in the case of Rem her very presence and existence was erased, in this battle, soldiers only forgot the names of the soldiers lost in the mist but are still aware of the fact that people are missing. So how do people remember a whole platoon going missing during battle when they're consumed when prior cases of the whale's mist made it clear that you wouldn't even be aware of the lack of anything missing? This is just one of many small plotting issues littered across the show, and the only conclusion is that the creator needed another plot twist to hook viewers in, but fell victim to a plot hole later on when it no longer served a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nSuburu is said to smell like the witch to a few people, yet, from all accounts, no one has ever encountered the witch face to face, so how do they know this assessment to be accurate? So the statement:\\n\r\n\"Do I smell like the witch?\"\\n\r\nis no better than saying:\\n\r\n\"Do I smell like the thing you've never seen or come in contact with in your life?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe entire show is just built on one unanswered question after another. How did he arrive in this world? How does his respawning ability work like a save point? In episode 24, he was shown to restart after getting past the whale and into the mansion, but then he could conveniently go back to the point where he defeated the whale as a save point after he dies at the village? It's obvious that this was done only to bypass having to reset the progression he made with Rem in episode 18. A moment where the show bends its own rules by going beyond simple retconning, instead, rewriting the very nature in which the resets work. \\n\\n\r\nHow could he speak their language and be understood but not write their assigned text? It's minor things like this that demonstrated that they wanted to appear insightful, but in actuality had only half-baked ideas\u2026 half-baked ideas that gave way to a show riddled with plot inconsistencies. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there're just scenes that are supposed to be tragic but just come across as ludicrous. Episode 15 contains the biggest culprit that comes to mind. This is where we met joker-inflatable-tube-man, who proceeded to break Rem's neck and limbs, and yet, somehow, she crawls over to Suburu and uses magic to free him\u2026 and this is supposed to be tragic? Nothing about this moment makes any sense whatsoever. And to top it off, it also demonstrates a moment where the writers switch Suburu's mental breakdown on and off whenever it suits the story. This isn't some \"deep\" moment; it's bullshit. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero doesn't know the difference between mental anguish and parading characters around for personal amusement, nor does it understand that tossing ideas and lifting entire passages from other folktales don't mean it would work as a cohesive piece. There's a reason there's no cohesiveness between arcs; all it does is pattern storylines from works that proceeded it. A fairy tale whose identity can't exist without leaching off of others, and whose attempts at something different result in the aforementioned problems. \\n\\n\\n\r\n*******end of spoilers*******\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen Hayao Miyazaki said that people \"don't spend time watching real people\" with industry, in-house anime creators being \"humans who can't stand looking at other humans,\u201d this is what he's referring to: shows that can't find inspiration outside of their own anime tropes because the people working on them don't see anything beyond anime. Re:Zero is a self-indulging anime with no worldly influence to speak of. Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, Satoshi Kon, Mamoru Oshii, Yoko Kanno. What made these industry giants well-known was their ability to draw inspiration from influences outside of anime. They brought something new to the table, a claim that shows like Re:Zero can't prove. It's a product of its environment. Anime feeding into anime. It's Ouroboros incarnate. \\n\\n\r\nRemember that thought I told you to hold on to, as to why I still suggest this show, regardless of how I feel about it? Well, this is the reason why. This is what it all boils down to. Re:Zero is an embarrassingly pompous try-hard that's fun to gawk at. It's a show that has proven to be a source of entertainment for those unconcerned with the finer details and who simply want to be amused for 20-minute intervals, as well as a comical mess for those who do see beyond the smoke and mirrors and enjoy dissecting silly shows for purposes of discussion. It's a show that takes itself dead serious while being oblivious to the fact that it's anything but. It's the Elfen Lied, the Mirai Nikki, the Akame Ga Kill, the [insert your own example here] of 2016. A show that could appeal to everyone, regardless of how they view their entertainment or how much thought they place into the pixelated images flooding their peripheral. It's the \"M. Night Shyamalan\" of animated works, a name big enough to fill in seats on opening night, but consistently funny enough for critical thinkers to jump in knowing they'll experience something amusing, even if unintentional.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone wins. The studio heads make their profit; the majority get to be entertained, and the critics get a new punching bag for their inner circles. The world needs titles like Re:Zero. Titles that everyone will see. Cynical cash grabs will always come and go, but if I'm given a choice in the matter, I at least want my price of admission to be a show that's still entertaining. And with Re:Zero, that's what I got, a good ole dumb time. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is a great show if you don't care for subtlety, think 2-D waifus are laifu and are impressed by characters emoting in boisterous ways. But in terms of actual quality, this is an anime that puffs its chest out, holding its breath for as long as it can, with the slightest release exposing it for what it truly is: hot air. \\n\\n\r\nI could count on one hand the number of shows I've ever used the forbidden \"pretentious\" word on without so much as second guessing my stance and I would unequivocally state here and now that Re:Zero became one of them. A show that strong-armed me into using a buzzword that I promised myself I would use only as a final ultimatum. And in a way, I guess that could be seen as an achievement. So congratulations Re:Zero, a show where only the cheapest blow every self-respecting critic dare not to resort to, could be the only appropriate response left available. But in this case, it's worth it. No other shows I've seen in recent years deserve the rare honor more than this. Take the mantle Re:Zero. You\u2019ve officially become the most conceited MMORPG-inspired anime to date.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is spray-on tan psychology with peel-off sticker-tattoo themes. It's the kid on internet forums who are constantly saying \"90's Baby,\" with a 1999 birth certificate. Its out-of-touch executives googling anime-related search results in an attempt to assure their product is \"totally dope.\u201d It's an anime that's rallied in on a stage sponsored by corporate suits, with \"best waifu\" pillows and other merchandise already pre-made upon launch date. Re:Zero is shallow, plain and simple. A skim off the surface of whatever topical events stick their noses out far enough to be noticed by those too busy counting the zeros in their bank account to dig any deeper. \\n\\n\r\nBut you know what? That's fine. I watched it, laughed and had a good time. And if people could cherish the laminated copy with the same vigor that others do the genuine article, who am I to stop them? Shows like Re:Zero will always come and go; you could either fight it or say \"fuck it\" and simply kick back and enjoy the nonsense on screen. \\n",

            "content": "Imagine a show that repackages some of the most recurring themes in anime today and make it into a fantasy thriller. That\u2019s what Re:Zero essentially is. Adapted from the novels of the same name, the show is more of a darker fantasy story than most people may be familiar with. It\u2019s not exactly like a show where a character is stuck in a world and they try to find a way out. Or is it making a parody of the show itself. Rather, Re:Zero (Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu) is a fantasy thriller that has some delirious complexity.\r\nEarly impressions of Re:Zero may trigger viewers\u2019 comparisonto series such Steins;Gate, Erased, or even the live-action movie, Edge of Tomorrow. What do all these have in similarity? It\u2019s the idea of time travel. The ability to loop back from the present to the past is a fictional theme we\u2019ve all heard of before. It\u2019s nothing new and Re:Zero essentially portrays that with Subaru, the main male protagonist and his reset ability. The ability \u201cReturns by Death\u201d allows return to a \u201csave point\u201d after death with all memories intact of the original user. Basically, Subaru gets a chance to fix mistakes so that consequences can be avoided. The key word here is \u2018chance\u2019 as it\u2019s not always guaranteed that Subaru can change the future. By adapting this idea, Re:Zero\u2019s early plot developments shows how Subaru uses his ability to make a difference while trying to live his new life in this unfamiliar world.\\n\\n\r\nFrom that world, we meet a variety of characters. One of the most recognizable character in the show is Emilia, a half-elf who has a mysterious origin. Her identity is similar to another infamous character in the series so others sometimes mistaken her for that. In the meantime, Emilia is a friendly girl although can be commanding and sometimes childish. The relationship between her and Subaru is important as they grow to understand more of each other. One of the important dynamics about their relationship is that Subaru acknowledges her as a good person. This feeling coupled with Emilia\u2019s growing trust of Subaru establishes a bond between the two. Two other characters in the series (Rem and Ram) are also introduced whom Subaru gets acquainted with. In the later stages of the series, Rem shows obvious feelings towards Subaru that grows into love. Similar to Emilia, Subaru acknowledges Rem despite her shady past. And because of that, Rem grows to care Subaru as one of her closest friends.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to really ignore the relationship principles of the show. Subaru forges many important relationships including a contractor, a female knight, and even a guy that once humiliated him in front of everyone. From the get-go, Subaru really isn\u2019t a guy that is afraid to take risks. This sometimes leads to irrational decisions with disastrous consequences but he is also able to learn from his mistakes. In addition, Subaru is an idealist and firmly loyal to those he cares about. He is also clever and uses trickery (possibly from his real life skills) to get what he wants. On paper, Subaru is generally portrayed as a kind man but not afraid to show his tough side either. In essence, Subaru is the most \u201chuman\u201d character in the show. He makes mistakes like humans do and tries to correct them. What I do find irritating about Subaru though is what motivates him for his decisions. This can also lead to other fans of certain characters they\u2019ve grown attached to. Because let\u2019s face it, Subaru has flaws and the writing of the series shows those flaws.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Emilia is a character that I find less appealing. Quite frankly, we just don\u2019t know her enough and it\u2019s hard to understand her in general. Her relationship with Puck and the other characters aren\u2019t fully explored. Furthermore, her personality is hard to get attached to even as they are shown from pieces to pieces. To be honest, the female character that stands out the most in the show would be Rem. She has a background story that is explored including with her twin sister, Ram. The relationship development between her and Subaru is quite memorable as they risk their lives for each other. And furthermore, Rem has her own reasons to help others (in particular Subaru) that viewers will easily understand. Anyway, I think the point I\u2019m trying to make is that between some characters, some just stand out than others. For instance, a breakout character in the show would be Wilheim as we learn in depth of his motivations to fight a giant whale. On the other hand, there are other characters that is just plain replusive such as Petelgeuse from the Witch\u2019s Cult. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the dark fantasy style of Re:Zero, the show still remains lighthearted on many occasions. As a light novel adaptation, you\u2019ll probably find many standard tropes ranging from the generic jealousy of certain girls to childish antics of Beatrice. Subaru also tends to make himself look like a fool in front of others which can be irritating to watch. Still, the comedy of the show on most occasions is properly timed to balance out the darker themes. The fan service comes mostly from violence rather than the skin. In retrospect, Re:Zero deconstructs its fantasy themes and twist them into a darker direction. From an adaptation perspective, the show is faithful to adapt some of the most important elements. However, the series is considered incomplete as there are certain plot elements that are unresolved. The way the director adapted the series seems to focus as much as content from the source as possible while keeping the story credible and on point. \\n\\n\r\nWhite Fox adapts the animation style and Re:Zero is mostly well crafted. The character designs gives the feel like they are from a fantasy world. Characters such as Emilia, Beatrice, the twin sisters, Felt, etc has their own unique presence. The monsters in the series such as the White Whale and Mabeasts also look intimidating. In fact, the Re:Zero world is something you\u2019ll find in any fantasy tale with the lustrous landscapes, dense forests, or medieval-like castles. As you probably know by now, the series has a lot of violence so expect characters such as Petelgeuse and Elsa to showcase that. Most of is censored as White Fox goes out in attempt to make it credible. However, it\u2019s still perfect although I heard the BD/DVD releases will feature more violence.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s also something else that deserves recognition, it would be the soundtrack. The thrilling OST portrays well for a show that has such an eerie feel. The heroic moments and climatic segments are also made memorable with the show\u2019s instrumental choreography. OP and ED theme songs are well crafted with the talent of the singers and producers. In the meantime, I think character voice mannerism also deserves some praise especially for characters like Rem (who can express human emotions quite) and Puck. And while Petelgeuse is quite an unlikeable character, one has to admit that his voice stands out as a villain.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time you\u2019ve finished watching Re:Zero, you\u2019re probably asking yourself if the journey is worth it. The deconstruction of a typical fantasy show is evident as each episode progresses. We get quite an adequate amount of characterization on the main cast. And many times, I think it\u2019s easy to find yourself anticipating what may happen next with the numerous cliffhangers the show offers. Indeed, Re:Zero is less of a \u2018trapped in game\u2019 style story but more of a fantasy thriller. Every episode offers something the fans will hunger for. And if that\u2019s not enough, then you\u2019re watching it wrong.\\n",

            "content": "A final review of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu \r\n(Re-updated; it may contain some spoilers, so be aware of it):\r\n================================\r\n\"If you are suddenly summoned to another fantasy world without any kind of preparation, what will you do?\" \r\nSome of the reactions of other people is that some of them would really panic and do not know what to do... but on Subaru's case (the main character of the story), he is 'trying' to rationalize his situation even though he experienced different kinds of despair and other negative emotions about his current situation and trying to adapt to his new environment. At first, he is tryingto stabilize his mental state and too desperate about what will happened on his situation. After that, he gradually gained some information about his current situation. On the later scenes, he met this beautiful elf girl named Emilia who saved him on a unexpected pinch situation; more like a boy-meets-girl situation, and then... the wicked-like fantasy adventure of Subaru begins and how the lives of other important people who he met throughout the story that could affect his decision-making on his unfortunate situation. How can he survive?\\n\\n\r\nThis show, Re:Zero is one of the great anime shows premiered on Spring 2016 that exemplifies the life of a certain boy named Subaru in a fantasy world and how he could adapt to his new environment. It would surely enjoy most of the viewers who like fantasy-themed or 'isekai-themed' anime shows to watch this kind of show because it seems 'not usual' to other similar-themed anime shows; it is filled with action, comedy, drama, and some thrilling and unexpected time-traveling and dark-themed scenarios... Wait... Time-traveling? Dark-themed?! How is it possible? Well, he noticed that he can not use any kind of magical powers but later on, he realized that he gained an ability called 'returns by death' when he was on a pinch situation. As the skill name itself, he can go back to a certain time and place where he could start again his adventure. Later on, he discovered that he has this kind of 'shadow(?)' magical attribute. Those mysterious ability and magical attribute are really helpful in his situation but also somewhat makes his situation more complicated or pain-in-the-ass because of its 'unknown(?)' origin. At first, the story-line seems confusing, depending on the viewer's perspective but it really gives dark/mysterious-vibe and cliffhanger scenes which surely gives us viewers more hype and thrills in this show! Generally-speaking, this anime is not the best but it is definitely one of the best anime shows of Spring 2016!\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the multimedia and other aspects of this anime show are very good, specially the character designs that really emphasized the unique traits of each characters in the story. If you know about the animation studio called White Fox (the animation studio of this anime show), it would really show that it has similarities on their animation style and forte on making their own style. If you know those similar anime shows they created, it would really increase the impact towards the entertainment of the show. In my opinion, there are some quality flaws in other animation stuffs like CGI and other designs on some episodes that are not really well-fitted or blended to the show. Nevertheless, those are not really a big negative factor to the show and does not really affect the quality and the development of the story-line. On the positive-side, I really like the animation stuffs like the point-of-view angles they emphasized on some scenarios on some episodes and it really follows the concept of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening & ending songs are so great and also fitted to the theme of the show (e.g. the lyrics and the style of the songs), which I also like in this anime show. I did not expect that pop punk-ish(?) OP theme song was performed by Konomi Suzuki, and I do not know what would be my reaction towards that since her usual J-pop anime song styles are really not like that. In my opinion, the new anisong artist MYTH & ROID's mysterious-and-futuristic-style J-pop theme songs of this anime is better in this anime show compared to Konomi Suzuki's opening song. In addition, there are no really obvious and noticeable errors on the multimedia aspects of the show like audio timing etc. The voice actors and actresses are also very talented that they really portray to their specific character roles. Some of them are newly popular with the anime fans like the CV of Emilia (Rie Takahashi) and the CV of Rem (Inori Minase), which can contribute more to the audience impact of the show. In addition to that, they also performed some of the OSTs, therefore it really shows their professionalism towards the show. The BGMs are really great and it and fitted to the action and other scenes of this show, which also mainly contribute to the impact of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline of this anime show is one of the greatest factor that mostly contributes to the impact of the show, including those amazing plot twists in every episode. Even though the story was rushed, I really like how this anime show would try to show some important plot contents from Re:Zero's light novel, which the animators/creator(s) of this anime really want us to fully enjoy the every 20-min episodes. The characters are also great because they provided great character designs that could somehow adds to the entertainment value of the show. Personally-speaking, the light novel is a 'must-read' to those fans who want to fully understand what Re:Zero's plot is all about.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the character traits, it was somewhat positively contributed to the audience impact on the show that later on, it creates that 'waifu' war between cute and loyal demon/maid girl named Rem the beautiful elf girl named Emilia or called EMT by Subaru and the fans. Furthermore, most of those characters have their unique lifestyles like the like Subaru who has really unique traits and 'realistic-like' personality compared to the other main characters out there; he is more vulnerable and has this kind of 'irrationalism' that makes him more 'human' compared to other common and overpowered main characters with god-like powers that were mostly existed on other popular anime shows, therefore it creates a different kind of twist to the story. The supporting characters like Rem & Ram, Puck, Beatrice, and other villain characters are also very important to the development of the story; they have their own character developments and big involvement throughout the story, therefore they are also somewhat popular to the audience. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the show's entertainment value, some people would not really enjoy/appreciate the concept of 'moe' characters, un-emphasized development of other important characters because of limited time, some clich\u00e9 elements like the concept of 'isekai' or other world with fantasy setting, and the unusual main character's behavior that were integrated in Re:Zero's story. It is because it ruins the seriousness of the story or it somehow deviates the norms and concepts of an usual fantasy or other related genre to the theme of Re:Zero. Despite of that, it is still interesting because of its uniqueness and somehow entertaining to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nWith all those double-eged critics/controversies/rumors we've heard, I can assure you that this show's is very interesting and breath-taking in each episodes, which is a big proof that this anime show is one-of-the-best anime of Spring 2016. Well, you can see it for yourself to confirm that and I really hope that this review would encourage someone who does not any or little idea about this show to watch this! Also, for those who knows this show, encourage them to watch this show.\\n\\n\r\n(P.S.: If you have really no idea about this anime, there are Part A and B in Episode 1, so do not forget to watch those to fully understand the story's synopsis!)\\n\\n\r\n================================\\n\\n\r\nTechnical Score: 8.25\\n\r\nBias/Personal Score: 9\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8.63 \u2248 9\\n\\n\r\n================================",

            "content": "No spoilers.\r\nThere are two types of haters of this show. One group is made up of elitists who overanalyze the show, and the other group consists of people who can't even understand the show and call it edgy. What both groups do not understand is the purpose of the anime.\r\nThe anime is about the development of Subaru's character, and it is executed brilliantly.\r\nWhat makes a show good? A good show should be easy to follow while still challenging the audience to think. It should appeal to the audience's emotions, and most importantly, it should be entertaining. Re:Zero does all of these things excellently. \r\nSome criticsargue that there are several plot holes in the story, but it really depends on their definition of plot holes. There are only a few trivial attributes of the world that are left unexplained as the excess of worldbuilding would detract from the flow of the show. Re:Zero builds suspense not only with every failure of Subaru's but also with every success of his. It is an emotional roller coaster from start to end, be it frustration with or sympathy and empathy for the main character.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThe story is brilliantly written. Yes, symbolism and references are shoved blatantly in front of the audience. Why? Because normal people do not watch a TV show and thoroughly analyze it. One example of the brilliant writing in the anime is the allusion to a Japanese folktale. It is used to foreshadow or subtly hint at the backstory of a character. How often does something like this happen in other TV shows and movies? The show forces the audience to think, but it doesn't confuse the audience with obscure and unexplained references.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nSome argue that too many of the characters are flat and generic. However, the show also dives into the minds of other characters, Rem and Emilia. Although most of the minor characters are one-dimensional, it makes sense that these two are developed as they are also main characters of the show. The addition of development on minor characters would simply blur the show's focus and turn it into a mess.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of Subaru's character is logical. It may be too realistic for some, but watching his human nature is enthralling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWhite Fox used the facial expressions and movements of the characters to capture their emotions, which was extremely captivating. The art is beautiful, but some CG was also used. The fight scenes are average.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nEverything sounds great from the OST to the openings, endings, and insert songs. Insert songs throughout the anime are especially powerful, expressing the mood of each episode at the perfect time.\\n\\n\r\nIt is interesting to see that so many elitists hate the show. After all, the show is a deconstruction of the generic overpowered main character, similar to Evangelion. Perhaps elitists simply hate new, popular anime.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, elitists do not represent the majority of anime watchers. Everyone should still watch this show and decide for themselves whether it is good or bad.",

            "content": "Before I start my review, let me just say one thing - FUCKING WATCH THIS SHIT! You will never expect what's coming if you just base your opinion on its premise or art style.\r\nMoving on, if there is just one thing that I had to choose to say why Re:Zero stands among the best of the best, it is the realistic take on a fantasy world MC (Subaru)... and the character growth (read suffering) that he goes through. Some arcs were just plain depressing and disgusting to watch. How pathetic can the main character get? Well, that's where this anime outshines most others. This makesthe final redemption arc all the more satisfying to watch. And it's not just Subaru, there's Rem! Right from her initial reaction to Subaru to the culmination of everything beautiful in episode 18, it was perfect. Same goes for Emilia. From the kinda uptight girl that saves Subaru in EP1 to the conclusive finale where she goes through an emotional release (in a good way), her character, while it didn't develop much, grew to be more open. I can keep on talking about the other characters, but I think Tappei (the author) did a wonderful job here. So characters? 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 9/10\\n\r\nKudos to White Fox for doing such an amazing job. Lots of wallpaper worthy shots.\\n\\n\r\nOST - 9/10\\n\r\nAgain, White Fox did an amazing job here plugging in the songs at very appropriate times. Not a big fan of any of the OPs. But the endings, goddamn. Episode 18 stands out as one of the best use of a song ever ~ (Wishing by Rem). And that title drop gave me goosebumps.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\r\nEver watched an anime that just the perfect mix of action, adventure, comedy, romance, mystery, drama, tragedy, etc? You haven't yet, if you have not watched Re:Zero. Right from the delightfully comedic interactions between Rem/Ram and Subaru at the start to Subaru's distressing and pitiful redemption arc, it was just so wholesome and complete. However, the story was not perfect. Some decisions the MC makes, make no sense whatsoever. But they can be overlooked when you think how good it integrates the different genres.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, I'm going to add one more category for the rating - Community. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nWatching an anime episode after episode on the day it airs might be frustrating sometimes. But in the case of Re:Zero it just made the anime all the more enjoyable. Thanks mostly in part to r/anime, r/Re_Zero, twitter, MAL and also /a/. Having a community to share the meltdowns and good moments with, is something that cannot be put in words.\\n\\n\r\nSo, just go ahead and marvel in the glorious suffering anime that is Re:Zero, while I sit here wishing I can start this anime, again, from Zero.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2, WHEN?\\n",

I thought this up until the last scene were the main character is murdered. Soon afterward he \"respawns\" at a fruit stand in the market, this is what hooked me. I realized that this anime is doing something no anime has done before. It made me care about the characters, and even become sad when they died even though I knew it would just be reset when Subaru dies.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe story wasn't just a lovestory, it was a journey of drama, loss, friendship, and enemies.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful.

            "content": "Note: This review was written a while ago when the show was over. Thus, it does not necessarily represent my current opinions, writing, scores or anything really. Still, I somewhat stand with the core ideas of the review.\r\nWill this review ever get noticeable enough to be featured in the top of all the other reviews? No. I like expressing my opinions on all of the shit I watch. Sometimes there are times where an anime comes by and I need to make a full review instead of adding my opinions on the \"tags\" section. This review is directed for those who found my profile andare interested on reading my full opinions on this series. Minor spoilers ahead. I hope anyone who reads this enjoys my rambling review of the hottest show of Spring and Summer seasons, Re:Zero.\\n\\n\r\nWHAT'S UP WITH ALL THE HYPE?:\\n\r\nI'm confident when I say Re:Zero was the surprise of Spring 2016. When Winter was ending and we got a look of all the shows that were debuting, no one was talking about this. Everyone was too caught up with Boku no Hero Academia, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Kiznaiver, Bungou Stray Dogs and Joker Game. As soon as the first hour-long episode aired, the community was divided on those who thought it had the strongest start of the season, and those who thought it was another \"stuck in another world\" show trying to be edgy and having cute girls falling for the main guy. I didn't get into the hype train until approximately Episode 6 or so and damn, this was an incredible experience. I've always hated Sundays because I knew I had to study study study, and the thought of having to go to school/get shit done was a pain. After I found Re:Zero, Sundays became my favorite day of the week.\\n\\n\r\nA thing that bothers me is that many people tend to hate on really popular shows BECAUSE they are popular. I know there are some who have a valid reason for not liking a show like this, but it pisses me off when people hate on a show because it's becoming mainstream. A trend I started noticing is that people flew to compare it to a certain show that is is known for dividing the community between those who think it's \"THE BEST ANIMU EVA\" and those who think it's the lowest piece of trash ever, Sword Art Online. At first glance you could probably say their are some similarities. A guy gets transported to another world, meets a bunch of new people and ultimately meets a girl that changes his life. However, go deeper into the story and you'll soon realize it is nothing like SAO. From the \"time travel\" elements, to the complex rules regarding the world and far more interesting characters, Re:Zero far exceeds SAO as far as I'm concerned. Not really worth mentioning because it's very obvious if you actually watch the thing, but this comparison of these two completely different shows with a completely different set of ideas bothered me to death.\\n\\n\r\nSCATTERED REVIEW: \\n\r\nMan this show is painful to watch, in the best possible way. Since I started paying attention to seasonal anime, I have never seen an anime that moved me as much as Re:Zero has. It is the first show (including TV series) that had me on the edge of my seat, desperately waiting for the next epsiode to come out. Instead of \"Re:Zero\", a more appropriate title for this show would be \"Re:Cliffhanger\". I have to admit that at one point I thought that this show was over-reliant on cliffhangers. It uses cliffhangers on situations where it's not necessary, raising your expectations to later find out that it wasn't anything all that special. It may sound like a bad thing, but this method is extremely effective at making the viewer watch \"one more episode to find out what this cliffhanger was about\", later to realize it's already midnight and you just binge watched the whole thing in one sitting.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals on this are pretty solid. Does it have 10/10 animation? Not really. It has its down times (especially during fight scenes), but other times it has really amazing visuals. What I can say is that it has good enough animation to make it work. Where I think shines the brightest is the sound. All the openings and ending songs are catchy as hell and the show knows when to use what track to peek the drama. The best word I would use to describe the soundtrack is memorable. When I listen to certain songs, it takes me back to an important scene and that is the best part about it.\\n\\n\r\nA complaint I heard is people complaining that the MC is abnoxious making the show unwatchable, but doesn't some of the most highly acclaimed shows have annoying characters that make stupid decisions? Look at Neon Genesis Evangelion as an example. I personally haven't seen it as of the creation of this review, but I've heard Shinji is a huge pain in the ass. People need to have in mind that these characters are created this way for a reason, either to progress the plot or make things a bit more interesting. I'm not saying you need to like Subaru as a person, but keep in mind that he is supposed to be an unlikable character at times. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I wanted to talk about is that people were calling this a \"harem\". From what I understand, a show is considered a \"harem\" when 3 or more girls are romantically interested in the main guy. During the whole season, only two characters are shown being romantically involved with Subaru: Rem (best girl) and Emilia (she's alright). It doesn't bother me personally, but I found it funny how people quickly threw the \"it's a harem\" card before most of the characters and character dynamics were even introduced. Is it because it has a bunch of cute girls, or is it because people want to call it a harem as an insult? The reasons are beyond me, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is the type of anime where your judgment will solely be based on enjoyment factor. This is not a series where you can point out how \"objectively good\" it is (which is a term I don't agree with).  If you take a step back and critique Re:Zero without bias, you will find that it lacks originality at times, and \"techincally\" doesn't have a proper plot or main goal. This will be major turn off to some since the anime never tells us why or how he gets transported to the parallel world, what's his purpose or what he needs to do in this world. The \"story\" of Re:Zero is basically this: the main protagonist is presented with various problems and he needs to find a way around them, whether it is survival or saving someone. In every arc, a new problem is presented and Subaru needs to find a way, using the knowledge he gains throughout his various lives with the help of his \"Return by Death\" ability, to solve it. I would say Re:Zero is more about the journey rather than solving or accomplishing something. This is taken as a fact considering that not even the source material has answered many of these questions. For the time being, light novel readers and anime watchers will have to wait until all our questions are answered.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero also suffers with contradictions, like how one episode Subaru is super idiotic and can't figure out what's going on (even if it's super obvious what's going on), and then later in other episodes comes up with smart and complex plans to save the day, making you wonder if he's supposed to be smart or dumb. An example where the opposite happens (an anime where people judge it not by how much entertainment they got from it, but by how well directed or how great is the story) is Legend of the Galactic Heroes. There's plenty of scenes that I would say are really good directed, but Re:Zero will have a greater impact if you care for the world and characters like I cared for them. If you don't care for the characters or for what's going on, you will not like Re:Zero (especially when the dramatic moments come).\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be very subjective in this statement, but Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World- is the complete package in terms of what I'm looking for in an anime. It has the mystery of \"what will happen next\", the characters are interesting and you care about them and want them to succeed, the world Tappei Nagatsuki (original creator) created is so massive and so open to possibilities that you can't help but make your own theories and wonder what new concept will be introduced next. It has the drama, the romance, the action, the comedy, just everything I'm looking.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\\n\r\nFrom what I'm seeing in the upcoming season, it is safe to say Re:Zero will be the most talked about show of the year (tied with probably Erased). I found this series one day when I was bored scrolling through my Crunchyroll. I watched the first hour-long episode and thought it was pretty good, but never I imagined it would be probably my favorite series ever. A few weeks in and I was completely obssessed with this show. It quickly earned a spot on my favorites list, even before it was finished. It never bothered me that the ending could turn out to be shit, because what it did during my whole viewing experience was enough. Nowhere I had seen a series where an entire episode (Ep. 18) could literally be two characters talking and be my favorite out of 25 episodes to choose from. I may sound like a 13-year-old fanboying for his favorite show, but I just wanted to make this rambling review to get my thoughts out there so I can go to bed at peace. \\n\\n\r\nAs expected from such a popular series, people from both sides of the coin (those who love it and those who hate it) have rushed to give their opinions now that the show is over. Re:Zero is truly the perfect example of an anime you will either love or hate. I can't tell you if Re:Zero is great, it all depends on you. Trust me, my lack of experience with other anime compared to other people and my bias makes me far from the guy to make a truly objective review. All I can do is tell you what it did to me. Reading all the reviews destroying the show and truly analyzing all its flaws with facts is a bit heartbreaking to read and made me see Re:Zero for what it is, but I can't deny the fact that I cried, I laughed, I rolled my eyes from how cringy the situation was, I got excited for the big reveals, I got chills when the drama peeked, and this \"piece of trash\" had me thinking more than any other anime I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 8.5\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this isn't for everyone. This review is very subjective and you have the right to disagree. What you can't disagree on is this: with all the hype behind this show, you can love Re:Zero, you can hate Re:Zero, but you can't ignore Re:Zero.",

Even with so many similar elements from different anime mixed there, Re: Zero is still very original series in a sense of taste.\r\nThere's been some kind of weird mocking to some of the heroine in this anime in several forums, and that's been driving people straight to disinterest with the series. I hope there's nothing like that happening again in the future. Re:Zero is a great series, and people shouldn't be so disinterested with it because of cancerous community.\r\nThere's some aspects that I love about this anime:\r\n1)Main Protagonist's change of character.\\n\r\nPeople tend to hate a character with unsightly attitude in some event in anime or manga. But for me, it's something beautiful to see. It's stronger than seeing character that found new power. Some good character attitude development is really hard to pull since writer have to know, feel, or even experience some event that can trigger ones character. In this series, Subaru is one that have solid characteristic development in attitude.\\n\\n\r\n2) Literally got one set of attractive Heroines.\\n\r\nI can't deny that I'm really attracted to Rem after watched Episode 18. Emotions flows like roller coaster from hate to love. I really like the strong toddler magician that stays in her mansion to keep it safe. There's less of Ram involvement in that series so I can't make out any good impression of her so far. And of course, Emilia is one charming main heroine, but I hope there's more of her if there's ever a 2nd season, cuz I still enchanted to Rem more than Emilia.\\n\\n\r\n3) Interesting Story (of course it is but I just have to point it out)\\n\r\nThere's been some anime that has same kind of setting where the main protagonist trapped or goes to another world or dimension, the main protagonist can go back in time to change things better, set in kind of a medieval time. But Re:Zero really meshed all of that into one beautiful romantic fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nI really recommend this anime to you who loves series like Stein's Gate, Guilty Crown or GATE.",

            "content": "This is quite though anime to give insights on. There are a lot of part from this anime that I really like, as much as parts that I didn't really like. But I did enjoy this anime a lot and it is worth for overall 9.\r\nWhat I dislike:\r\n- Story coming in and out without proper prologue and ending. Why Subaru got suddenly sent to the fantasy world, what is his relation with the Witch, and so on. It will be exciting turnouts if audience got explained those things. I am truly expecting a longer series instead of 25 episodes. Something like HxH where in theend (perhaps) Emilia became the Queen and Subaru getting strong and defeat the Witch which is in the he became the King. Nice End.\\n\\n\r\n- Second! This is the one of the worst part is Subaru. Yes, for me his one of the worst main hero, he acting over-stupid & childish almost the entire series, not to mention he is weak af. He stayed too many episodes with that kinds of character and it really frustrating and exhausting to watch him doing stupid thing, acting irresponsibility, and helpless all the time. Seriously...when I start watching this anime I was REALLY expecting he is somehow awaken a specialised strong skill (other than keep on dying and repeat) but as the episodes gone one by one, he is truly not moving up in terms of strength (only got that stupid shumac). Although he did getting strong mentally, for Godsake...that was after die at least 3 times for the same events. I have seen a long anime series like HunterXHunter which is the character developed very well the entire series. They have up and down, but they are progressing in all kinds of way which Subaru doesn't have.\\n\\n\r\n- Betelgeuse Romanee Conti. Really the most annoying antagonis in anime. He just simply a psychotic and to make it worst, he out-powered the main character (Subaru) by far. Seriously, why it so hard just to give him death. I prefer character like him die once and then Subaru met the witch. Conti really psychotic and an antagonis without charisma.\\n\\n\r\n- Last! The series is again...TOO SHORT. I am really expecting for second season with a proper finishing episodes. Not hanging like this. When the story start we have TONS of characters introduced on each arch. Not to mention Felt! She is suddenly brought up from slump to the kingdom but then that's it. She doesn't make any difference in the story at all in the end. It will be nice also that each candidate have their own arch story (just like Wilhem got for himself, his romance story when he was young, a background story to be precise) \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like:\\n\r\n- Rem. Yes Rem. And maybe most of other audience does. Rem is one of those character that progressing REALLY WELL in the story. You can see how she change throughout the episodes. how and why her relationship and feelings for Subaru growing strong. She is strong and yet you can find a soft spot in her character.\\n\\n\r\n- The romance conflict. I might say the romance conflict is really nice. Emilia is loveable, Rem also loveable, Subaru have a strong will and he is really expressive (too much most of the time) and all the romance conflict is relevant to each individual background (Emilia being a half elf silver haired witch, Rem being a half devil, Subaru being stupid and helpless but strong will) Not to mention that Subaru forbidden to mention his Reset ability which is make the case even harder. But what I think audience need to get is that love romance doesn't developing faster than the series and ended up hanging (as I said before it need a longer series to make it a complete story and finish)\\n\\n\r\n- Wilhelm arc story. It is beautiful imo and it gives a different wind to the story. I was hoping if there will be the next season for Re Zero, they will come up with more background story (just like Wilhelm story) like the story of each kingdom ruler candidate history and side story. (We don't even know Emilia and Subaru background story for Godsake! We don't know who they are, why Puck tagging along with Emilia and kept on saying Emilia as her daughter etc, where they come from, how do they got into their current character they are) I am seriously have no idea why the author doesn't make it an agenda to make proper introduction on each character. Which is will help to make a greater emotional connection for the audience with each character.\\n\\n\r\n- Emotional connection. I got pretty nice emotional connection with Rem since she got introduced quite a lot to the audience. But somehow I despise Subaru and technically don't care with him, which is actually bad thing since he is the main character. I just hope he doesn't hurt Emilia and Rem more than he does.\\n\\n\r\nArts:\\n\r\nThe art is cool. I love the coloring, the face construction. Art always been kinda priority for me before continuing the series and Re Zero doing great. Emilia is so loveable, Rem, and most any girl in the series. The man varies from bishounen to shounen. The environment really rich in colour and details. But I have seen better in Kabaneri, Inari konkon, bakemonogatari series, so I will settle with Score 9 here in arts.\\n\\n\r\nSound;\\n\r\nI love the ending and opening which I find it suited with the anime theme and all. I just hope they make instrumental soundtrack during the scenes instead of the full voice music. Styx Helix really bring a strong atmosphere of romance and battle, Paradisus Paradoxium also. Myth & Roid really fit into the anime so well, and the way the music mixed really match with the weird theme of Subaru got summoned to another world with reset ability (or curse). 'Stay Alive' in contrast is a soft spot in the series that really fit all Emilia x Subaru x Rem in term of romance. But for 'Redo' I don't particularly find it fit with the anime but still I like this anyway (don't know if it because I love the anime that I then love the theme song or vice versa)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAs I said in the start, I have like and dislike but in the end I enjoy the anime a lot. I enjoy and quite hopeful with the next episodes since the first episode. But then they leave me hanging with that episode no.25. \\n\\n\r\nI DEMAND 2ND SEASON! I DEMAND EXPLANATION & I DEMAND A PROPER ENDING!",

            "content": "This review of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu is solely based on my personal views and overall enjoyment watching the show.\r\nStory: With the influx of all these anime shows about a protagonist being transported into a fantasy world/game, this specific show, Re:Zero, certainly doesn\u2019t sound like anything special. In fact, when I first heard about the anime announcement for this show, I was pleasantly surprised but not at all hoping for anything that would blow me away. To me, I was hovering around the idea that if anything, I would enjoy watching the show because \u2013 while not original \u2013 it might end up beingsomething fun. This is coming from someone who only briefly skimmed through the manga and had no true prior experience with this series from the light novel or web novel before watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing this show, I really had a hard time figuring out how I wanted to say what I wanted to say about all the things that happened, all the things that I felt while watching Re:Zero. One thing was sure, Re:Zero\u2019s story was anything but special. But I feel like the point was, that while it was only average in terms of bare story, how the author developed the story \u2013 and characters (which I\u2019ll get to later on) truly made Re:Zero something special to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Where do I even begin? This show has some better character development I\u2019ve seen in a long time. I\u2019m sure a lot of people will disagree with me, but that\u2019s just how I felt. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m right, but I\u2019ll go into a little detail as to why I think so. One particular character that receives a lot of hate for what he does and how he acts is Subaru, the protagonist of Re:Zero. I can understand how people feel, but the self-reflection and growth that Subaru had by the end of this series was truly something unique. \\n\\n\r\nI know, I know - this is a fantasy setting, but how realistically portrayed the feelings of each of the characters is depicted really sold it for me. Obviously not every character had the same \u201cgod-tier\u201d character development as, let\u2019s say Subaru or Rem (I won\u2019t go into them anymore than I already have, I don\u2019t want major spoilers), but something that I found myself doing was actually caring about characters - characters that weren\u2019t necessarily the main focus. I actually was interested in characters like Wilhelm and his quest, and cared about him enough to hope he was successful. From the friendship of Subaru and Julius, to how Felis felt doing something he didn\u2019t want to do, I actually cared about the characters and how they felt. All these moments were what made this show much more than I could have ever asked for.\\n\\n\r\nArt: There really isn\u2019t much for me to say about the art. It fit the show. There were certainly moments that I thought the CG looked off, but for the most part, they did a good job with consistency. And I have to give them props for not using CG for some major scenes with big creatures flying around in the sky. (I\u2019m sure you guys know/will know what I\u2019m talking about after watching the show). \\n\\n\r\nSound: Oh man, this category. What can I say? White Fox did an outstanding job setting a mood with the right music. I felt so many emotions that I probably wouldn\u2019t have felt if they hadn\u2019t went the extra mile with the right background music, or the right ringtone in a scene. The amount of effort that White Fox put into each and every detail in the sound department was award winning in my honest opinion. They made the scenes that were already great, exponentially better because of how they used the score/OST. Also, props to the voice actors/actresses. Some of the VAs must have worked their asses off to pull off the voices we heard in the show. I honestly have nothing but praise for the VAs and sound department working on this show. They did one hell of a job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Obviously, as enjoyment is subjective from person to person, I won\u2019t expect you all to agree with me on liking this show. Some people are more critical. Some people want to hate because they didn\u2019t like how the show\u2019s direction went. It could be because two characters didn\u2019t end up together that you really \u201cshipped\u201d together. Or it could be because you didn\u2019t like the main character and how they acted. But in the end, my personal enjoyment is pretty important as to how I rate a show. And while there were moments I didn\u2019t like as much as others, it wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t like the show. Those moments, where I didn\u2019t like a character, or direction, honestly was just a byproduct of how invested I was in Re:Zero and its characters. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is a deconstruction of your every-day, generic transported-to-a-fantasy-world-esque show, and I certainly think the show does a pretty solid job at what it set out to do. It defied my expectations and went the extra mile in so many categories - especially the sound department (which I can't stop emphasizing). It made me feel connected to not just the main characters, but to many of the side characters, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt this invested in a show and its characters for a long time. Now, after reading this far I'm sure you know where I stand at least in terms of recommendation. Would I recommend Re:Zero? Yes. I really would. Do I expect everyone to like it as much as I did? No. Definitely not - after all, this show wasn't perfect - it's far from it. But I personally feel like it\u2019s worth giving a watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\n/============== Scores ==============/\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8.2\\n\\n\r\n/=================================/",

            "content": "Ahh Re:Zero, the anime that is in my opinion looking to be the best show this year (beating erased). The anime that actually inspired me to write my first anime review, despite me being a lazy fk. \r\nApart from having excellent art, soundtrack, story, voice acting (especially voice acting) and direction (pacing) there are several underlying themes and messages (sometimes subliminal/hidden ones like in its OP). This is a show that will go against all of your preconceptions, judgements and/or expectations of a trapped-in-an-another-world type anime and will present to you something that feels entirely original somehow. It's one of those don't-judge-a-book-by-its-cover type shows. \r\nThereare many things I could talk about this show that would take too long to express, so I'm just gonna stick with presenting some plus and negative points.\\n\\n\r\n+ Interesting story about a shut-in neet suddenly appearing in fantasy world and has a strange respawn ability 'return by death'. With no purpose/reason for his summoning he has to cling to those around him and deal with things that will challenge his very sense of self. My synopsis might seem cliche and uninteresting but since I'm lazy I cbf going too much in-depth (I'll probably spoil it anyway). The story however is surprisingly the strong point because I consider the world-building in this show to be top-notch. Even though it has a time-travel attribute, it is not similar to Steins;Gate (which casts a shadow of expectation over it). It is a fantasy story first and foremost, and a very well made one at that (not the harem/romance type or Lord of the Rings type fantasy, it's more like a 'follow the journey of the MC through the world' type fantasy). It certainly isn't predictable, cliche or boring to watch (except the first few episodes). \\n\\n\r\n+ Soundtrack is very good. It doesn't simply have catchy OP's and ED's but impressive orchestral music and also utilises the sounds of objects, breathing, movements to really set the tone of the scene and your expectations of what is about to happen. Episode 15 is a good example of this.\\n\\n\r\n+ Right off from episode 1 we see very good art/animation (but not so good during some slice of life scenes). It manages to be fairly consistent throughout each episode and does give off the feeling of watching a well-made show. Character designs are also top-notch, with characters that actually add to the story being drawn well enough to be memorable; almost all characters/creatures were unique looking as well. I don't think there's a single character that looked boring, plain or weird. \\n\\n\r\n+ The biggest selling point of this show is its constant sense of mystery, foreshadowing and the whats-gonna-happen next factor. Unless you've read the light novels for this show there is no way you can predict what happens next, even on a minute-to-minute basis. It was almost a 'one cliffhanger per episode' situation going on. Although this is fairly what you'd expect from time-travel like plot, the plot twists and cliffhangers don't feel off-putting, outlandish or just plain weird (think Mirai Nikki's weird ending). Instead they actually do what they are supposed to do - shock and hook you, get you hyped and make it hard for you to stop binge-watching. The best comparison to this feeling is watching Game of Thrones. \\n\\n\r\n+ Main plus point for me was the fact that RZ took an overused genre, flipped it on its head and excluded nearly every character and plot trope that makes the genre so hated. Although its not blatantly presented to the audience, there were several central themes that were strongly developed that were in my opinion quite meaningful. Primarily, the deconstruction of what a true hero/protagonist should be was a key reason why I rated the show even higher than I might normally do. \\n\r\nAlthough it happens a lot in anime, the dialogue, execution and specific way the show demonstrated this theme, was quite unique (chiefly that its 'unlike' most shows) and outstanding. For the sake of brevity, I'd suggest watching the show to judge it for yourself but I think one would at least somewhat agree with me on this. \\n\\n\r\nDespite having many other +'s I could talk about I'm just gonna skip to the negatives cos this is getting TL;DR.\\n\\n\r\n+/- Main character Natsuki Subaru does not follow that standard behaviours you'd expect from a protagonist. Although he isn't made into a sort of anti-hero or villain like Light Yagami (death note) he certainly isn't a great person. This show is really self-aware of the kind of things a protagonist should do but it instead illustrates a MC that doesn't necessarily always do it. In short, the MC isn't made to be appeal to the audience's expectations (he, like the other characters in the show, feel poly-dimensional), so often there are cringy scenes/dialogue/inner thoughts around Subaru that can really make you dislike him at some points, but you can be rest assured that he does end up redeeming himself. He becomes the protagonist we all want in the end - starting from zero hehe. Essentially his character could decide whether its a plus or minus point for you. If you don't take the time to understand his character, and pay close attention to the show, it's likely you'll think he's dumb, over-dramatic or whatever (which is what most critics try to argue); which is a shame because he is actually very well-written. \\n\\n\r\n- This does not affect me personally but there are some hard-to-watch scenes, blood and gore so it might not appeal to everyone. I certainly don't think its done to the point where you'd just want to drop the show but I can say that it doesn't hold back at trampling over your heart lol. In other words, there is plenty of shock value but there is always a 'weight' to the gore, unlike Tokyo Ghoul where there is literally blood/gore everywhere all the time and you don't feel anything, its more like that feeling when you first watched Attack on Titan and you're just there like 'WHY? OH WHY?'\\n\\n\r\nOverall it doesn't matter if you think its good or bad at first, I would recommend just diving into it because regardless of its plot, it is definitely one of the best shows this year. Most of the hate the show receives is pretty much coming from people who want to de-rate it because they weren't that impressed, or they completely missed the meaningful points the show presents etc., and they end up using nit-pickery arguments or misrepresent/misunderstand/over-exaggerate some of its negatives. Trust me, it's not nearly as bad as any negative reviewer would make you believe. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is a fun show to get hooked on. It doesn't primarily concern itself with being philosophical, something really deep or trying to be a masterpiece - although episode 18 and some other episodes show potent and interesting digressions of human nature. Its not the best thing ever, but it definitely is above average. \\n\\n\r\nYou can really see how it is a passion project and that White Fox has put it in a lot of effort into it. It's definitely a must-watch show. Although it does have some flaws (mainly near the ending of the show), the cumulation of so many amazing moments and the dramatic, fun and interesting ride that I went on while watching this convinced me to award it a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nP.S If I had to rate it as objectively as possible I'd still give it as least an 8/10 but it just doesn't feel right. It simply excels in every department I can think about (or care about anyway), exceeded my expectations and was just too enjoyable a show to give it an 8.",

            "content": "I'm pretty sure some of you are thinking that Re: Zero is another overhyped anime that isn't nowhere near the hype it deserves. Well, let me just say it now: Re: zero deserves all of that hype and score, or at least most of it. It is an exceptional anime, composed of many different kinds of elements that elevates the anime even further. The entertainment (and despair) it manages to give every single episode is astounding, and paired with great characters and great animation and music, makes this anime truly a must watch for any anime fan.\r\nYou probably have already seen this kind of apremise before. The main character living in a normal world, suddenly gets dragged into a completely different world. And also time travel. It is not the most unique premise by any means, but time travelling as a genre has been one of the more difficult ones to work with. In anime, time travel might not make sense, create gigantic plot holes, and can potentially halt any kind of character development. Unfortunately, Re:Zero does have some small plot holes regarding time traveling, but that's to be expected since the story is not yet completed. However, Re:Zero still brilliantly manages to weave in the time travelling aspect of it so that it still manages to be entertaining and bring a good development.\\n\r\nI also feel like that this anime is a great example of how to make every single episodes. It doesn't drag, nor feel boring. Each and every episode is just so fun and makes you want to watch more and more of it. Another awesome thing to point out is that, Re:zero sometimes likes to omit openings and endings in some episodes, giving it even more minutes to work with, which was awesome to see, as one thing I feel like most anime need more of is time. (This is not saying the openings and endings are bad in any way.).\\n\r\nOne unfortunate thing about this anime however, is the fact that the adaptation isn't close to finishing yet, so we are left with a lot of unanswered questions. Lot of things like the essence of how Subaru is able to go back to a certain checkpoint or the fate of the bowel hunter is still unclear. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also fantastic. It doesn't have clunky movements nor uncomfortable lighting. The fight scenes are great to watch, but the best parts for me were those lighting touches in the background which contrasted well with whatever the scene given. Sometimes light, sometimes dark, it just affects the mood of the scene so well. Some episodes, the animation is done so brilliantly that some scenes almost feels like a movie.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound section is great as well.. The soundtracks are really nice to listen to, the standouts being the ones with choir,  and they accompany the scenes really well, especially in episode 15. It isn't a standout of the anime, but it is definitely worth noting, as it manages to stay consistent throughout the episodes. The voice acting in Re:Zero is amazing. The seiyuus, especially Kobayashi Yuusuke (Subaru), bring out some amazing emotions from the characters, which obviously is a must have in a despair-inducing anime like Re:Zero. Also, who can forget Yoshitsugu Matsuoga's unbelivable performance on Beteleguese? The voices aren't annoying, the soundtracks are great, and the OP/ED are one of the best of the season. It is just a really solid aspect in the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow the most important part in any anime: the characters. First thing is, I see a LOT of hate for Subaru. Granted he isn't strong and is sometimes frustrating to watch, but I personally don't think he's that bad of a character. We see him struggle, fight against the seemingly impossible, and eventually develop as the series goes on. He might not be the most pleasing MC to watch at first, but I feel like this is what Re:Zero is all about: Natsuki Subaru's development. You first see a guy, cocky and arrogant, who runs into hopeless despair, so useless, yet trying to do everything by himself, transform into a guy who willingly seeks help from others to save Emilia and many others from the horrible fate awaiting them. \\n\r\nThere are also a lot of other diverse characters in the show. Rem, for example, is easily the most likable character in the show. Her strong willed determination and great fighting prowess is a shining light to Subaru in many ways. We also have Emilia, Suabru's love interest and a half elf trying to ascend the throne although being discriminated by others for being too similar to a witch. The relationship between her and Subaru, although at times cliche, develops throughout the series, along with Subaru's personality.\\n\r\nOne thing I like about Re:Zero is that it literally has everything in terms of characters: Struggling MC, powerful woman beside the MC, maids, lolis, traps, knights, psychos... everything.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, Re:Zero is definitely a must watch show from the year of 2016. Its intensity, suspense, plot twists, and development makes the hype completely justifiable imo. The awesome fights and dramatic cliffhangers all add to the anime. Though the story itself is might not yet completed, the questions might still remiain, these unanswered questions only further serve as a good reason to watch the next season of this great anime. \\n",

            "content": "Re:Zero is the story about Natsuki Subaru who is summoned to another world, a magical world. He befriends or more like falls in love with a half elf girl who saves his life from hoodlums so in return Subaru wants to help her finding her lost insignia. He and the girl are killed by another person while looking for the insignia. Just then Subaru finds himself alive back to the moment when he came in this new world with the memories of his death and everything that happened. And so starts the great journey of Subaru.\r\nNow Speaking of Subaru he surely was a good maincharacter, well he was cringy sometimes but dude was a gentleman and likeable unlike other trap in another world anime MC *cough Kirito-sama cough*. Characters overall were mostly good Our main heroine(don\u2019t know if telling her name will be a spoiler) is really kind, beautiful and strong lady and no tsundere characteristics thats a win right?. She doesn\u2019t get much time in second half but the person who gets that time is REM!!!!! Yes the best girl, The Ultimate waifu material!. OK that is not really how I think about her but she gets a lot of development than any other female character and she is quite lovable. Other characters don\u2019t really get much time but its ok at least they\u2019re likeable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I liked about Re:zero other than the characters was the amount of substance. There were so many events and it felt that the show is progressing at a fine pace. OH and the animation was great as well same goes for sound. Voice acting was really good especially the voice acting of the villain Petelgeuse. \\n\\n\r\nThere were so many cute moments and then there were insanely brutal and heart-wrenching scenes. I felt bad for the Subaru when he was in pain, I smiled when rem did, it was just so nice.I cared for the characters and that\u2019s another win\\n\\n\r\nAND OH MY KAMI-SAMA EP 15!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Re:zero was an amazing experience for me. I enjoyed the hell out of it without turning my brain off. Great characters, great animation and sound and heart wrenching moments, Its just great and I don\u2019t think there is any need to find anything bad in it of course there might be some but I really recommend you to watch it. 8.75 out of 10\\n\\n\r\n+great animation and sound\\n\r\n+loveable characters especially Rem\\n\r\n+A progressing story\\n\r\n-A slow start(truly slothful)\\n\r\n-still there is need for season 2. Can\u2019t wait for it my head trembles!!\\n",

            "content": "This was hands down one of the best anime I have ever seen, The story, art and soundtracks fit together like pieces of the same puzzle giving off - Depending on situation - A feeling of happiness or despair. It will keep you at the edge of your seat craving for more, and that's exactly why I waited for it to finish airing in order to start watching.\r\nFor the first time I've sort of connected with the main character, and lived through the ups and downs of the story, felt happy at the heart-warming moments, and cried at the desperate ones.\r\nThis anime proves to usthat an MC doesn't always have to be Overpowered in order to look cool or be a true hero! Unlike your typical \"Transported to another world\" series, this one was truly a masterpiece unlike others, and didn't succumb to the stereotypical \"POWER LEVEL... OVER 9000!!\" idea that most Main characters transported to another world have.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't get me wrong, one doesn't have to be special, have unparalleled mana or Saitama-leveled physical power at all! This series shows us that willpower is enough in order to turn the tables, and to the point where even a weak human can become a hero.\\n\\n\r\nIf you put aside the fact that it's a fantasy anime, it won't get any more realistic than that! In my opinion the producers tried to make us understand something: You might go through lots of desperate moments, might lose people dear to you, make the wrong choices and despair, but that's exactly what it means to be human, we all make mistakes, a lot of them, but we all have the ability to fix them, and that is exactly what you'll witness in this series. And as I always say: \"If you try to move forward while looking back, you will -Without a doubt- trip and get hurt.\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of long reviews so I'll end it here, even if you know that it'll get a happy ending, YOU WILL GET HIT BY THE FEEL TRAIN! And dozens of times at that, but it'll be one hell of a ride and an amazing experience! It might sound weird saying this but even if it's an anime, you'll definitely get something out of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least, the one thing we shouldn't forget: #RemBestGirl2016!!",

            "content": "Hey there, do you enjoy watching a decent romance+drama+action anime with realistic characterisation that attempts and mostly succeeds in depicting the effects of a teenage boy seeing and even experiencing death over and over again? Well look no further, because if so, you have an interest in observing a mental breakdown and the subsequent road to redemption. Re: Zero depicts this fairly well.\r\nTo put it simply, Re: Zero has a distinct personality that is accused of being generic and edgy. Nothing quite screams generic as a character that makes mistakes and learns from them. It's almost as if he is human. If you never makemistakes or have an aversion to making mistakes and improving yourself, please avoid this show. \\n\\n\r\nA maturing male protagonist? Check. A mysterious female protagonist that raises more questions than answers? Check. Girls with washboard racks because such people actually exist, and where one of them may have feelings for the male protagonist because what is love? Double check. You have your average level of diversity of characters which allows a show to appeal to a wider demographic. Such characters include, the temperamentally affectionate one, the little people and the odd \"weird\" ones which definitely are indicative of a bland cast. Who wrote this?\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a melting pot of genres such as drama, romance, mystery, action and more which is a treat to watch in measured doses. Of course, i could compare it to another deconstruction such as madoka and point fingers all day accusing it of being a failed transplanted clone. I won't though. Who would do that? \\n\\n\r\nWith elements of mortality (or lack thereof) as well as violence and time travel, your expectations are sure to be sated unless you have an aversion to life itself which has its share of serious and light hearted moments. If you have an aversion to anime which depict both the ups and downs of existence, please avoid this show.\\n\\n\r\nI respect the characterisation of the male protagonist because he evolves from being a wide-eyed wannabe hero to twisted selfish person to knight in shining armour (minus the armour).\\n\r\nHe is a boy of many identities; Selfishbaru, Sadbaru, Madbaru, Badbaru, and Whippedbaru.\\n\\n\r\nArt was a little iffy for my taste but sound was satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nOverall - 8.6\\n\\n\r\nAm I 12?

            "content": "Well I\u00b4ve started watching Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu  not knowing what to expect.\r\nI\u00b4ve heard a lot of people comparing to other series such as KonoSuba or Gate, except a bit darker. During the first episode it seemed pretty casual, nothing really innovative, but at the end of the first arc I really wanted more. So, here goes my review for Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu. IT CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM THE FIRST 2 EPISODES.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story of Re:Zero is at times complicated, at times predictable. It is that contrast that makes it enjoyable. Of course, there are a lot of series with much morecomplicated plots, but they tend to be hard to watch. Re:Zero took a pretty simple story of a teenager somehow finding himself in this medieval fantasy word. Nothing new, right. Well, that is until the MC somehow goes back in time, after being murdered. That is one of the most important part of the story, as well the part which makes it less predictable. Some things will be going alright and then the MC just dies, and must do things all again. While I loved most of the story, there were a few episodes in the middle which felt a little bit too cringy and dragged out. Also, since it probably will have a 2nd season, the story left quite a few unanswered mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nYou can probably find quite a few shows with a fantasy colorful setting ( KonoSuba, as mentioned earlier), so what makes Re:Zero different. Well, this shows art and animation are fantastic in my opinion. The character have somewhat original faces, the background are usually filled with details, making the world seem more alive. The animation is nice and smooth, and they even managed to make big battles smooth through good 3D animations. Although some of the non-humans look too similar. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty good. The ambient makes it a much more enjoyable show, even through the more story-driven parts of the series. The battle music gets you hyped up. The intro was good\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a few very interesting characters, with good backstories. Our MC Subaru Natsuki is sometimes one of them. I don\u00b4t what to spoil much, but if you watch the show you\u00b4ll see what I mean. He sometimes acts very cool, other times he can be boring or even cringy. There are a few characters that will make you feel sad, some will make you hate them. MY main complain would be the sometimes appalling acting of the MC, and some other characters that were just dropped after a couple episodes without mentioning them anymore.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA cleverly written story, with a few twists, interesting characters, a lively world, a good soundtrack. It really feels like a compelling story, it can even make you interested in the history and lore of the world that it is set in ( Which is pretty good for a 25 episode long show). But I can\u00b4t give it a higher rating then 8, because a few episodes in the middle were kind of hard to watch in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said already, it really a great show. A strong contender for best summer 2016 anime. If you like fantasy anime, i recommend it to you. If you like some soft-core horror anime I would recommend this to you. If you like romance anime, yeah I guess it passes. Maybe there is an anime that gives you all this and even more, and it really loves you and respects you, but I love Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu.",

            "content": "Episode 7 as of writing.\r\nAs of writing this, it will be my first, and probably only, review. To put it succinctly, this show is amazing. It was the show that made me get an account and write a review.\r\nIt starts basically as a generic Boy goes into an RPG. But it is so, SO much more. The characters are realistic. There is humor. There is also gore- it is not for the squeamish. The story is engaging. I guess a murder mystery would be the closest way to describe it. I have never enjoyed those, but my gosh- each and ever episode leaves you hooked,and indeed on a cliffhanger. Perhaps the best thing, however, are the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Main Character takes a little bit to get his power. This is understandable. However, he remains relate-able, for the most part, THE ENTIRE TIME. The Supporting Cast is all amazing. It's Episode Seven. They already have a fully fleshed out currency, a fleshed out backstory, a couple of fleshed out B plots, and a fleshed out setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are frequently skipped for MORE story. The animation is gorgeous but not the best. The VA's are INCREDIBLE. \\n\r\nStory-10\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nCharacters-10\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nOverall-10\\n\r\nI have only given one other anime a 10, and that was a 9.5 I rounded up, and before I found this place. This show is probably the only true 10/10 I've seen. It is simply amazing to me.\\n\\n\r\nObviously I am new at this review thing, so I will update it as the season progresses. Hopefully it doesn't peter out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nUpdate as of Episode 9-\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters get more and more complex, the sound and artwork is getting better not worse. I have little else to add, but I will bump Art up to a 9. So a 9.75, still a 10. It is absolutely great, an amazing show. But be sure to bring tissues, because for all the good stuff it's also incredibly sad at many many points.\\n\\n\r\nAnd another Update as of 11-\\n\\n\r\nNo spoilers, but it gets better and better. I have now been spoiled, though it's a good thing as I know where it's headed. IT DOES NOT lose steam. It IS sad. I don't know whether to classify it as Romance, Adventure, Horror, or something else. It's a portmanteau of all three, but the Horror is far far more prevalent than the others.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate as of 18-\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is it keeps getting better. Some rocky cringe episodes. I HAVE spoiled myself at this point. But for those couple of bad episodes, well, this entire anime is adapting so little it's basically the prologue of a greater story. And besides those bumps, the train has no breaks. It's amazing. Arts moved up to 10/10, leaving sound the only 9/10. Again, I can't get enough of this.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate at end- \\n\\n\r\nWelp, it's over. I gotta say, they cut a good amount of things I wanted to see. Especially at episode 25. However, that being siad, it was a show. They cut the OP and ED ALOT to fit in all they could- I can't fault them at all. It's still a solid 10/10, and I loved this show from the moment I started to the end.",

            "content": "Re:zero kara hajimeru isekai seikatsu is a kind of show that tries to be as simple as it simply brings the protagonist Subaru into another world,while at the same time tries to pull out a story that filled with many twists.Its a brave try,yet it works successfully.\r\nStory:(10/10)(35%)\r\nUnique and original story setting.We have \"respawn\",we have different kinds of species of creatures in the another world,all of that are all well drawn and described.\r\nSome people may think the story is too simple but I felt in the opposite way,as the story filled with a lot of twists and climax.Once Subaru was arrived into the unknown world,he meta lot of events which causes him die a lot of times and all the events are all unpredictable,which makes me felt Incredibly excited and thrilled.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Subaru made changes after each of the 'time travel',which made the story continue to move on.Meanwhile,as the story goes on,it introduces different personalities of each character.I think this not only make depths on the characters but also keep the audience stay tuned,which make me felt in love with this anime,make the whole content feels rich.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is well-connected with all of the other characters.All of the storyline is based on characters personalities and characteristics.For example,Subaru have desire on become more strong and willing to protect others.But on the other hand,he is over confident about himself,he feels like he is just an otaku in an fantasy world.The fact is Subaru actually has no idea or knowledge about how things actually works in the world,which cause him so many troubles through the story.He is also very unlucky due to many unforunate things bring to him and nearby characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:(10/10)(25%)\\n\r\nPeople may think Subaru is dumb and weak,which cause this anime a disaster.However,I think this is actually the highlight of the character development,as when weak people feel he is weak,that person will definitely make improvements.Also Subaru have positive attitude on \\n\r\nprotecting others and caring others.For example,when he first enters the world,he actually not \\n\r\nafraid yet the first thing he do is to help others.\\n\\n\r\nFor other characters,such as rem,ram and Emilia,they all show their point of view when Subaru is tried hard on protecting them.For example,Emilia is first ignores Subaru,then have good impressions on him but then afterwards she was annoyed by Subaru's movement on which Subaru doesn't respect on others.They even being introduced on their back stories on their childhood life,which explains why Rem felt Subaru untrustworthy at first but felt trustworthy with Subaru when Subaru make changes after his death.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the above shows that the anime did a great job on describing each characters and able to make the characters individual.\\n\\n\r\nHowever,since they focus too much on Ram and Subaru,Emilia seems to be forgotten from the show.All I know is Subaru is lovesick with Emilia but only because she is adorable and he wants to protect her but that's it,there's somehow no further explanation on that and the interactions between them is shallow,which the anime could be improved.\\n\\n\r\nThough overall it's still really nice,so 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound(includes music):(10/10)(10%)\\n\r\nSadly,due to the length of the story,the opening or ending music is always being cut off,feel some kind of enjoyment being ripped off,singing in op sounds is a bit unappealing,but it done well on the sound effects,background music and voice acting during the fighting scenes,really could add emotional feelings to the audience.Even during conversions,there's some soundtrack playing on the back,which can fits the story efficiently.\\n\\n\r\nArt:(10/10)(10%)\\n\r\nOutstanding,definitely meet my expectations.:D\\n\\n\r\nThe whole animation art looks realistic and the fighting scenes are absolutely exciting,feels like I'm in that world.\\n\\n\r\nEven in the fighting scenes,there are many magic skills,movements and combat with strategy ,which I feels it is extremely rich and exciting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:(10/10)(20%)\\n\\n\r\nFull of unpredictable climax,plot twists,realistic animation art and nice sound effects and voice acting must kept you remain on seats.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem is that episode 1 is way too long,although episode 1 is able to introduce the whole story background and some of the events occurred in that episode might affect Subaru's decision,the anime should shorten the length of episode in order to make it simple.\\n\\n\r\nBut since the good sides overcome the bad sides,it achieves a 10/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10(M)<Masterpiece>\\n",

While it is not something flawless, as one might think, this series is definitely doing its best to be enjoyable and interesting for its viewer. In my opinion, the fact that the creator of the series actually cares is very commendable. However, it is an open secret that trying to be fascinating and being fascinating is not the same thing. Thankfully, it is not one of these cases. Allow me to share my opinion on Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World, onthe anime that is able to leave one speechless, on the anime that bullies you, and on the anime that shows you many events, which are absolutely impossible to foresee.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero -Starting Life in Another World is a Japanese light novel series written by Tappei Nagatsuki and illustrated by Shinichirou Otsuka that also has three manga adaptations and an anime television series adaptation by White Fox, which began airing on April 4, 2016. The series tells us a story of Natsuki Subaru, a normal young man that lives his normal life in the modern Japan. However, one day, he is summoned to another world. Without knowing the person that summoned him, or the reason for being summoned in the new world, he soon befriends a silver-haired-half-elf girl, Emilia. Due to some unknown circumstances, the girl is being targeted by an unknown assassin. The assassin manages to kill the two and everything seems to be over. Yet, a second later, Natsuki Subaru awakens and discovers his new ability that he names \"Return by Death.\" That new ability gives him the power to reverse time by dying; however, only he remembers the events of the previous timeline. Why was Natsuki Subaru summoned in this mysterious world, who gave him the power to reverse time? Find the answer by watching Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World now.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that might come to your mind after reading the description of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World\u2019s story-line is that this anime is a mix of Steins;Gate, Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!, and Boku dake ga Inai Machi. And I must say that you will be right to think so. Of course, this anime has nothing to do with comedy, but all these four anime do have a few things in common. Anyway, Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World reworks all mistakes of its predecessors doing its best to be entertaining and I must say that Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World manages to do it. It is an open secret that the most important thing for all story-lines is to be complex: one should never be able to foresee more than thirty percent of events that will happen in the next episodes. In case of the anime we are talking about, you might have theories on first, on second, \u2026, on thirteenth episodes, but all your theories will be destroyed in an instant. That is, in my opinion, the best part about the story-line of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World is mostly top notch. There are many characters, they have sometimes unusual and sometimes very beautiful outfits, monsters, demons, some unknown creatures, and magic spells and they all are beautiful. At the same time, when this anime should become dark, it becomes dark. It is so amazing that it helps you to dive in the universe of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World. Without a doubt, it is not flawless, but it is on the level, which is very important for all anime that have such a setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is on the level, as well. From pop music to amazing orchestral pieces, Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World even focuses on music, which some anime tend to not do. Of course, it is not that important, but the amount of attention this anime pays to its music only helps you to dive into the universe of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World and to understand it better. I will not hide the fact that sometimes the music should have been more epic: when you see a good battle, the music should be epic very, but it is still able to make you have gooseflesh. Another part of this section, which is also worth mentioning, is the cast of this anime. All voice actors did one hell of a job making their characters vivid and lively. If it is a villain, you hate them with all of your heart, if it is one of the main heroes, you just wish that they succeed in everything they do and you cannot even imagine what you will do if something bad happens to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World consists of the main characters, Rem and Natsuki Subaru, supporting characters, and villains. While I would argue that the main characters do not receive enough development, I completely agree with the fact that supporting characters should have received more development. However, I believe that the main characters and the villains compensate for it well, since Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World has the edgiest villains that you have ever seen in your life. Anyway, let us talk about the main characters: Rem and Natsuki Subaru.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuki Subaru is the male protagonist of the series. On the way home from the convenience store, he is suddenly summoned to another world. He later discovers an ability that he names \"Return by Death\" that allows him to go back in time, if he dies. And the most interesting part about it is that only he remembers what happened and he cannot tell anyone about this ability. Natsuki used to be a hikimori, being absolutely useless, he has never done anything in his life. However, in this new world he should not only try to become more powerful, but also to use his wit. He will not be granted with the power to destroy the whole world, he does not have a guardian angel, or a harem of cute girls that will help him in every situation. He just has no other choice but to do everything alone, which makes him change himself. His character development is amazing and you just want to not see him suffer. Rem is the second main character of the series. She has a younger sister and both of them work at Emilia\u2019s mansion. When Subaru meets her, she shows absolutely no signs of being interesting; however, as the story progresses, Rem stops being a doll and becomes a very interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World do not receive enough development; however, as I have already mentioned, the villains compensate well for it. You just want to see their death, you just want to see their sufferings, and you hate them with all of your heart. While I understand that it is impossible to grant enough screen time for all characters, I still think that all characters are very interesting to follow and it should be more than enough for you.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I cannot guarantee you that you will like this series and I am not going to do it. Personally, I like the fact that this anime tries to rework mistakes of its ancestors in order to not make them again, I like the fact that the characters of this series are realistic and not overpowered like in some other series, I like the fact that it is never possible to guess what will be shown in the next episodes, which is very important, as well. With every episode, you are trying to prolong your enjoyment and to watch this series little by little; however, it is simply not possible. You just want to know what will happen in the next episodes. It is, of course, not flawless, nothing is, but if you want to see something very dark, I would highly recommend you to give Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World a try. I hope that you will enjoy watching Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu!",

            "content": "As you may guess, when someone gives a 9 to an anime, he isn't going to say it was a bad anime and I am no exception.\r\n**This review contains really minor spoilers, if you don't want to know anything at all about the story or characters, you shouldn't read it**\r\nStory (9/10) : About the story, you know it, no need for a synopsis, it's a few scroll away. Why do I think it deserves a 9?\r\n- Well first of all, the surprise factor. The first episode is a double episode. And while the first part isn't really original, I mean it's a classic transported-to-another-world animeat this point.The second part, however, was really unexpected and definitely drags you into the story. Long story short, the first part is all happy-go lucky, with a cheerful main character that meets a cute silver haired half-elf. And the second part is pretty dark and sinister. That first episode could be compared to the surprise I had when I watched Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, and I think it was amazing.\\n\\n\r\n- After that, there is the \"Return by Death\". This is the center element of the story pretty much. Some people will see this as a lazy way to put \"gore\" into this anime when it's just a tool to deconstruct the main character, which is also a main component of the show. I'm the kind of person that don't mind seeing the same background and (almost) the same interactions through 4 or 5 episodes, if you do mind, you should reconsider watching this, if not, then you should be fine.\\n\\n\r\n- The conclusion : To every story there is an end. Don't worry I won't spoil it, I'm just going to say that I think it was a nice conclusion imo. I know some people are really afraid of being disappointed by the end of the anime because it may ruin their experience (*cough* Death Note *cough*).\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you like some action here and there, some violence here and there, some gentle moment here and there, you should be fine with the story. Re: Zero offers a nice variety of emotions and plot twists. (As well as some magnificent cliffhangers)\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 : Animation is great, colors are pretty bright, the character design is good (lot of people animated in the streets, good looking backgrounds). The direction is fairly good too, I mean artwise there isn't much to say really, it's just good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 : The OST is good, especially that little chorus you hear at certain moments, it's really brief but you'll know what it is if you watch it. OPs and EDs are really good too, I love the 1st OP so much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10 : Now, the part that's really important, the characters. Let's do it one by one, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nNatsuki Subaru : Main character. He is transported to that fantasy world and his main goal isn't to go back to where he comes from but to save the half-elf girl. Why? Well, we do know little about his life before the sudden teleportation in this new world. But the first few minutes tell us that he is a shut-in NEET with no real social life and being a fan of video-games (most likely RPGs) this new world is pretty suited for his tastes. However, he'll be going through a lot during the anime, making him unstable at times. I think his evolution/developpment was well handled, now I think I should warn you that he is probably the main reason why people don't like this anime, so if there is one reason you may not like this anime, he is the one. But if you can bear with him, you should have a good time.\\n\\n\r\nEmilia : One of the main female protagonist. She is the victim of discrimination because of the fact she is a silver-haired half elf (saying more would be spoilers). However, she has the opportunity to become the ruler of her country and will do everything to achieve that goal. So, you won't be seeing her all the time, and even if she is the main love interest of Subaru, her lack of developpment and screen-time throughtout the show may not be well received by everyone. But her time will eventually come if there is a season 2. For now, she is an interesting character that we don't know much more about but I would love to hear more about her past.\\n\\n\r\nRem : One of the main female protagonist. Compared to Emilia, she will receive some developpment. Why? Because she has a key role in the second part of the anime and that developping her is essential at this point. That's what I like about this anime, it develops the character that will play an important role in the near future and I like this way of proceeding. I can only let you discover this character, that you'll get to know thoughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 : The cliffhangers, the twists, the brutal violence, the beautiful and colorful scenes, the characters, the atmosphere. All of this make my brain trembles. It is one of my favorites of all-time. Now I'll tell you this, if you're familiar with  the term \"elistist\" I'm just the complete opposite, I don't need a lot to enjoy an anime, and I love the isekai genre. So there was no way I couldn't like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 : In conclusion, don't get your hopes up or anything, I'm not here to tell you how to live your life, but when it comes to watching anime I think that the less you know, the better. But if you're here reading this, maybe you're just too undecisive, and you really don't know if you should watch this or not. I think the answer is in the first episode. If you liked what you saw, you can go ahead and watch the whole thing. This show repeatedly fits 24 minutes of straight content and I think it's just a proof of the investment and the general quality of this anime.",

            "content": "First of all before watching Re Zero i never actually read the web novels that preceded the series so the first time that i encountered the story, setting and characters was by watching the anime itself. \r\nNow lets get started. \r\nThe story for Re zero revolves around the character of Subaru being summoned to an alternate world from the modern world that he had resided in. This kind of story is a common enough theme having been started by series like SAO. \r\nThe character of Subaru is the main character of this anime . \r\nSubaru is your typical teenager and shut in that only caresabout himself and thinks nothing of others. Subaru's character changes a lot as the series progresses so much in fact that it's surprises me enough times whenever it happens. This is affected by his love for the main Heroine of Emilia. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning after Subaru encounters and befriends Emilia his attempts to impress her was funny but not that wise. This was his first personality. Gradually as he encounters and befriends more and more characters his personality changes and he shreds many of the weaknesses that his personality had and becomes braver, nicer and smarter and by the end of the series becomes a somewhat able combatant. \\n\\n\r\nSubaru's unique trait however is his unique ability which while sounding silly was actually quite remarkable and in my opinion really suitable for him. Unfortunately the series does not do a good enough job in explaining why and how he got this power. Another season will probably be able explain this. \\n\\n\r\nEmilia is the main heroine of the series and having seen a lot of animes since i started watching them she has to be the most gorgeous female character i ever seen. Emilia unlike Subaru is not completely defenseless in a fight as she is a mage and a rare type of one as well. Personality wise Emilia  is always willing to help those in need even when it will be easier to just let them be. This is exactly how she met Subaru in the first place lol. \\n\r\nHer attempts at explaining why she does so despite not getting anything back in return always puts a smile to my face every time i hear her excuses. \\n\\n\r\nAs a character and for the purpose of the story Emilia acts as the main love interest as a well as a motivation for him to survive. In this Emilia functioned pretty well as her personality and cuteness makes her both endearing and lovable. Because of this Emilia fast become one of my fav characters in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nRem and her sister Ram are both servants of the lord that sponsors Emilia for the leadership succession race that forms the second arc of the anime. Both work as maids and bodyguards to the lord and to Emilia at the mansion that she lives in.  Rem is featured far more than her sister Ram and can actually be considered the second heroine of the series. While they have a normal relationship with Emilia their relationship with Subaru is the highlight. The relationship between Rem and Subaru changes a lot over the series and especially so after a major event that those that seen the anime would know. The interactions between the two changed after this and though i always shipped Emilia and Subaru a part of me actually wished for Rem to be with him instead such was how sweet they were together. \\n\r\nIn this Rem's seiyuu Inori Minase deserves no small amount of praise as she portrayed Rem's character and personality flawlessly. \\n\\n\r\nBeatrice is a mage that serves the lord that supports Emilia's claim to the throne. At first Beatrice did not have the best relationship with Subaru but as ever this changed during the series. \\n\r\nI really liked her character as Beatrice spoke in a funny accent and yet she had a determination to  protect Subaru that she sees as something akin to a friend despite the fact that she will never admit this to him. \\n\\n\r\nRe Zero's story is another of the anime's strong points and it follows a standard three arc storyline . The story in Re zero is actually pretty straightforward and is relatively easy to understand and follow. Each arc introduces plenty of new main and support characters. Each of the story arcs are intermingled with each other pretty well. Out of the story arcs the succession arc and the witch cult arc was my favorite ones. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for Re zero was some of the best that i ever seen and i would say its something that is to be expected in a triple A anime like this. The character designs were well designed and i though that each character was well designed. \\n\\n\r\nThe music for the anime was pretty good especially the opening and ending themes. The individual scene music was also good and was appropriate for the scenes that it was used in. In particular i enjoyed the insert songs that were featured near the end of the third arc and i have to say that Inori Minase is a capable singer in addition to being a amazing Seiyuu. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that i like about Re zero is the sheer number of characters that feature in it both main and support.   \\n\\n\r\nAnyone that has seen the anime will no doubt have their own fav characters but for me mine will have to be Subaru, Emilia, Rem, Felt, Crusch, Wilhelm and Beatrice. Additionally the character of Theresia who was Wilhelms wife and though only a guest star was also a great character in small part due to her personality who was portrayed by the seiyuu Minami Takahashi of food wars fame. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the anime was top notch featuring equal numbers of veterans like Mamiko Noto who portrays the killer Elsa to relatively new seiyuu's like Emilia's seiyuu Rin Takahashi and Rem's seiyuu Inori Minase. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion RE Zero was a fantastic anime that had a combination of a fantastic story, excellent characters and excellent voice acting from some of Japans best and up and coming seiyuu's. This was definitely one of this years best anime and i can't praise it enough. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I got nothing else to do so I might as well watch a couple of episodes, and boy I was in for a ride. \r\nThe show surprises in so many ways. The characters are so memorable and charming. The musicis moving. Everything is on point. The lore, mystery, suspense, and the gore with a touch moe set it far and apart from other fantasy \"isekai\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe joy, suspense, tears, laughs, and thrills that came with the show is something that I've never experienced with any other show before. It's been such a ride watching this show from start to finish as well as discussing it with the community here. I love the Re:Zero fanbase. It's just amazing seeing it blossom into something this great and awesome. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I feel very passionate about this show. I don't know how to properly explain it.

            "content": "So I only gave the story a 9 because there is a main part of the plot that hasn't been discovered enough for me, which you may be able to guess after watching the series.\r\nRe:Zero actually started out pretty poorly, I thought I was going to hate the main character. So the first episode's pace is slow but once you can get through it there is 24 episodes of just pure original and brilliant story writing.\r\nThe characters are actually pretty unique, although we don't know much about why Subaru is there he actually is a really great guy. He is calculating and as high morals.He goes through a lot in this story and his character development was just the strawberry on top of a parfait of sadness, anger, regret, and tough choices.\\n\\n\r\nEmilia who is the other main character is hard to describe, she is very kind and caring and at first I thought she was tsundere. It actually turns out that she REALLY wants friends but because of what she has gone through she keeps people at arms distance but still manages to be the cutest thing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters that are introduced to us slowly but surely and out of all of them only 2 seem to have a trope attached to them out right, everyone seems to have actual unique personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design and world design is actually really breathtaking too, I cant imagine where the inspiration is. There are many different races that wander around this land and I REALLY hope we can explore more of the world that Natsuki Subaru was drug into. \\n\\n\r\nThere are nice political themes as well where Subaru has to make decisions to help Emilia going forward and reach a very interesting goal.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime had me on an emotional rollercoaster where I had to schedule a happy go lucky anime to calm down with afterward. ALL the characters make you fall in love with them and the way Subaru interacts with them all just warms my heart. This anime can be described as a well rounded anime.\\n\\n\r\nIts Shoujo and light, its serious and has really dark and deep moments, it has gore and turns your stomach, it is super freaking sad at other points. I can't wait for the second season of this and I will be hunting down the manga version and the box set.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound effects are also really well done and unique, there are times where a certain tone plays and you know something just happened and it leaves you at the end of your seat.",

            "content": "\"I guess, as long as I have this life, all I can do is fight with all my might.\"\r\nNatsuki Subaru.\r\nAn over all Review for Re:Zero\r\n==================\r\nRe:Zero is an adaptation of the Light Novel originally created by Tappei, being an adaptation can pretty much tell you the story is still ongoing and not fully covered by the anime, but it still brings a nice closure to the 3rd arc's occurrences.\r\nStory-(8): This show deals with the [Time Travel] aspect where the MC is able to rewind to a point in the timeline in order to prevent a lot of sad incidents from happening. So are we going togrow tired from the repetitive tragedies as our MC is just gonna get it fixed? No, that's never the case with Re:Zero. Our MC has no control over the point he rewinds to, and he actually has to pay a very high toll, his \"Life\". When someone around Subaru dies he is forced to confront what they actually meant to him, and how much he is willing to go to save them, Going to very extreme lengths. I would also like to point out this isn't \"Endless-Eight\" all again, the MC faces a lot of different incidents while moving on with the story as well.So the fact that our MC can shape his future doesn't mean that the tragedies have no consequences because it is nicely used for character growth and get us to know more about the sub-characters.This perfectly sums up in a fellow's quote \u201dThese kinds of events will never lose their emotional impact because it's never been about losing people; it's been about finding them.\u201d.THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL FANTASY SAO-LIKE ANIME!!. It's dramatic and somewhat mysterious & dark-themed. basically, every episode ends with a cliffhanger that will leave you hungry for more. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-(9): Side-Characters get more than enough development in the show, and they actually have their great effect over the MC's and the story's overall progression since the story is mostly character driven in the anime. As I mentioned the time-rewind shows us a lot about the side characters and their past, how they lived on with their traumas carrying it all on their backs but finally managing to recover from it as the story goes. The psychological aspect of the show is strongly emphasized through the MC who constantly struggles, falling into despair and almost running away. Romance isn't one of the main aspects of the show but it acts as a catalyst to the characters' progression.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt-(8): Moe Art style, but it never bothered me as it make the show's gore and depressing scenes easier to handle and characters even more likable.Although the art starts going low on quality at episode 24, I really respect WhiteFox for holding that long with the quality as they had to work extra time by taking off the OPs and EDs out of some episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound-(10): Okay. 1,2,3... EPICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC!!!!!. *cough..cough*. Myth&Roid have really done a great job here, 2OPs & 1ED perfectly show what this show has to promise, the lyrics strongly convey the feelings of the show. White Fox seriously put a lot of work onto the OST and their insert songs that enhance the despair mode and scary vibe. They also leave out both the OP&ED during some EPs to add more content, this shows you how hard White Fox worked on this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-(10): Off to the \u201c My Most Favorite Anime\u201d we go. The show is very captivating and breath-taking, it's packed with very intense moments that can (AND WILL) make you jump off your seat and bump you to death with adrenaline rushes \u201dGive me more!!!\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSome Notes:\\n\r\n*) This is my first review ever so please forgive my unprofessional approach at some points and also my mediocre English skills.\\n\\n\r\n *) The MC may look like a \u201cself-insert\u201d one who got summoned here by chance. Although it's still vague but the shadowing that there is one of the BEST PLOT TWISTS ever waiting at the end of the story is so damn great you can't even think about ignoring it.\\n\\n\r\n*) The \"8\" I gave for the story is mainly because the story isn't completed yet and I can't just judge it completely now, And that doesn't disregard the fact that this show is definitely the AOTY for me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "ReZero as an anime comes in a time where \"time travel\" animes has been all the rage for \"great animes\", and as LA said in LA's Erased review, LA loves time travel animes and this once again is no exception that LA will love this series from the outset. But saying this is a time traveling anime is a bit vague, at best it's a dimension jumping anime due to the nature of the main protagonist's powers, but that a bit later.\r\nReZero being one of the more hyped anime to come out of Spring 2016 and really it did live up to it and noit's not because LA is biased towards time travel animes, people have been talking about ReZero ALOT while it was being released, LA has some praise as well as problems to give to ReZero, ok enough introductions, let's get on with this.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's move onto the characters, more specifically, Subaru Natsuki. Subaru Natsuki voiced by Yuusuke Kobayashi is by far one of the more unique \"heroes\" in animes LA has seen, sure he is severely obnoxious and very much love to do the entire white-knighting play in order to become the hero, however where his uniqueness comes from is his power, if it wasn't for him, he would have easily be a more downgraded Rintaro Okabe from Steins;Gate, his power is similar to a \"game\", where every time he dies, he gets \"reset\" to a preset instance, cool power right?, but where the consequences and mental trauma sticks from \"dying\" is where Subaru becomes something else entirely, do remember that Subaru is in a fantasy land where witches, elves and ravenous monsters will brutally kill you in the most gruesome way possible and don't LA even get started on the ominous Witch. Subaru's obnoxiousness and whiteknighting personality even gets consequences when he does too much of it. LA will say here and now, Subaru is NOT a deconstruction of the typical hero/otaku archetype we see in many animes we see, LA did say that Subaru is a bit like Okabe and that is pretty close as they both use time travel in some way in order to protect those they love and is utterly determined to save to the point of their brink of their sanity, but ReZero's take on Subaru isn't a deconstruction, it's being \"realistic\" with his \"gaming reset powers\" for both his \"strengths and weaknesses\" to Subaru, because of that Subaru though obnoxiously as he is, he not only evolves, he learns from his mistakes even to the point that his powers can't change due to the \"pre-reset\" limitations, because of that, you can contemplate his misery and goals in wanting to succeed and seeing a realistic yet reckless dimension jumping hero. Ok enough about Subaru, let's move onto Emilia, Emilia voiced by Rie Takahashi is also bit of a unique character, as she's a bit of character archetype (cept Yandere) and on the outset, she was a great \"kind\" character but soon becomes something like a badass in disguise but she has her own goals she wants to do instead of just wanting to be Subaru's love interest, again Emilia is unique for that, however for the ending LA has a small problem with her, but that a bit later. Next up is the twin maids Ram voiced by Rie Murakawa and Rem voiced by Inori Minase, who get their own arcs just like Emilia does and we do get to sympathize with the both of with their backstory and how they got their personalities, however later on Rem gets a bit more screentime than Ram with a bit more of a role and really Rem became LA's favourite character by the end of the series. LA will say that for the most part, the main cast who interacts with Subaru gets lots of screentime, however some characters do get the shaft once Subaru gets into certain arcs, like Beatrice voiced by Satomi Arai and Roswaal L. Mathers voiced by Takehito Koyasu however even this little complaint is easily mended as really some of the arcs in which these characters aren't there don't become important for certain arcs. \\n\\n\r\nIf ReZero does something right is to execute the typical \"guy gets stuck in a fantasy world\" and \"plays against those tropes\" and sure it's plot structure early on fell on a slow yet \"tutorial\" foundation, ReZero later on makes that foundation as dark and violent as possible and utterly deconstructs the anime genre it is in ie. guy trapped in a fantasy world, and that really isn't a terrible thing, actually it's obviously refreshing with some solid writing, plot twists and great animation. LA will reiterate, the plot structure is a deconstruction of it's genre, Subaru as a character and his use of his power is being realistic with a dark undertone. \\n\\n\r\nLA will say that the plot twists work and executes well for the most part because of Subaru's power and the world building, though it makes sense, Subaru dying over and over again using different routes in order to find the best route would mean we get both world building and getting to know more of Subaru's limitation in power through this. Really because of Subaru's power, he makes leeway and hints to both world building and makes many of the plot twists work. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation by White Fox, has by all means some of the best quality LA animation LA saw, well \"best quality\" isn't the best wording, more like the most consistent. From the colorful character designs to the poignant to fantastical backgrounding to the brutalized and bloody battles, the animation was pretty great, though LA would say that the blatant yet quickly unfocused CGI used sparingly was a bit annoying at times for the animation, though the CGI is and is really rare (be it just offhanded lizard-carts etc.), nonetheless, animation was great even with the awkward CGI...though it felt like te animation took a small dip near the final 2 episodes in some rare scenes. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting-wise, the entire cast is pretty well done, with many VA's such as Inori Minase as Rem, Rie Murakawa as Ram, Rie Takahashi as Emilia, Satomi Arai as Beatrice and most especially Yuusuke Kobayashi as Subaru. If anything both Yuusuke Kobayashi and Inori Minase would be LA's favorite voice actors in this anime, mainly because the both of them went into the far extreme range in this anime, from dramatically intense to shouting their god damn lungs out to just trying to be genki and \"moe\". The only other voice actor to note is Betelgeuse Roman\u00e9e-Conti's voice actor Yoshitsugu Mastuoka, well talk about playing against the type, from voicing typical generic heroes *cough* into voicing this eccentric bundle of madness...if it wasn't for Yuusuke Kobayashi and Inori Minase, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka might have been LA's favorite voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were any flaws to this anime, would to be put simply, Subaru's powers to resolve everything by the end of it, he always find the right route to do it, be it physically or mentally, he finds a way to resolve matters. The other flaw LA would say is that, the solution or even little hints aren't shown until they are shown leaving us little room to actually make us think on how they are gonna resolve or ever will, but for flaws such as this, LA can easily say there are lots of defense for these kind of flaws due to how well written and executed this anime is that even with these flaws, ReZero can \"get away with it\". As such, Subaru resolving matters does take him more than once and dying in brutalized ways along the way, not to mention Subaru's resolution most of the time has both need help from others (as to be perfectly honest even with Subaru with this power, Subaru is by far the most weakest physical character in the anime) and that his passion and courage to get to his goal in admirable to say the least. The only time this flaw is shown and LA utterly hated is during the penultimate episode as Emilia is shown her moment of resolution with her villagers due to her discrimination as a half-elf and gave Emilia some GREAT character resolution, her badassness was just a bonus!, HOWEVER what with what happened later on it becomes moot comes the next timeline and Subaru effectively \"TAKES THAT RESOLUTION AWAY FROM HER\" just so that he can save everyone including Emilia and she is taken to the sidelines instead of her more badass and touching conclusion to her character, when Subaru gets top billing ALL THE TIME was what LA was annoyed and can justify this flaw as ReZero stumbling with it's compensation for the \"happy ending\", which wasn't good enough compensation that LA. The other flaw's defense can be summed up as due to many of the little hints given only gives the major villain of this series the \"Satella the Witch\" all the more reason to be feared as to what Satella does to restrict Subaru (or heck, even the Witch Cultists are something to be feared by sheer lunacy). ReZero gives us proper clarity (and solid writing) so that Subaru can't just do whatever he wants to AND so that he can't get away with the easiest route, thus makes many of the flaws in this anime as a very minor point. Well there was one more flaw LA noticed, which was that with this huge cast, it was to be expected that the screentime for some of the minor characters are small like LA said on the character section, even some of the main characters kinda get this besides Subaru, he IS kinda the main protagonist and that is the only other flaw that kinda irked LA as there were some main characters LA wanted to see more of *cough* the rest of the candidates to be King in the last half like Felt, Anastasia and especially Priscilla *cough* Rem in the last quarter *cough*...but LA did see why, they just weren't needed during those times and cramming those characters in there just wouldn't add up considering the situations here and there.\\n\\n\r\nIf there are STILL people who hate this anime because of Subaru, be sure that ReZero makes sure that Subaru go through hell and back in very physically torturous (and the fact he dies VERY often in horrific ways) and mentally draining moments that can make any sadist who dislikes Subaru grin. As for the typical narmy villains, typical character archetypes in this anime genre and token love interests for character flaws, LA will say that...welll...uhhh yeah LA can't put a defense for those flaws (well besides the narmy villains such as Betelgeuse and Elsa Granhiert, LA utterly loves the pure insane villain) besides the fact that ReZero ISN'T a harem and a more adventure based-dimension hopping anime and to a certain degree with the biggest character flaw going to Emilia, yeah she's a unique character with no character archetype but she's subjected to being bland due to her lessening screentime by the later arcs and for the love interest flaws, Rem outright for LA eclipses Emilia for best girl mainly because of Rem's character and romance development being much more developed than Subaru's whiteknighting romance to Emilia. What LA is being honest.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending well if you read the \"flaws of ReZero\" section, you'd know that LA got a bitter taste from the side effect of the penultimate episode had, however it slightly carried over to the actual final episode where Emilia essentially became a damsel in distress and although the final battle was slightly downplayed comparing to some of the other fights, it was decent. Really as much as LA was satisfied with this ending, the method on Subaru trying to get to this ending was slightly on \"easy mode\" besides the final battle. The ending did finally resolve the tension between Subaru and Emilia, however the ending still had a few loose plot threads left here and there ultimately saying to read the manga (unless there's a second season?) but still...as LA said before even with these small flaws in the ending, the ending was still satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nReZero for LA for it's technical prowess of it's characters and plot is one of the best animes LA has seen in 2016 and LA knows that this anime may not cater to the detractors from the obnoxious main character to the dark and \"edgy\" plot under the typical \"magically transported to a fantasy world\" but LA just can't help but like this anime, ReZero's strengths by far outweighed it's weaknesses.",

Reasons why:\r\nAmazing story and plot.\r\nFun and interesting characters.\r\nGood animation and sound.\r\nFelix.\r\nThe main characters at first will look like the typical harem-like main character but as the series progresses you will see that thats not the case. In the start of the anime he acts like a self entitled prick but soon sees that that attitude will not get him very far in this world. He is the most humanlike character i have seen, he is not some overpowered guy that willbeat all the odds, or someone who gets god-like powers that equal those of the villians. He is an average fit guy.Thats it. He cant go toe-toe with most characters in the series and will get completly destroy if he even tries to. But as you know \"knowledge is power\". Using the information that get got on his previous life he will beat the odds. You might think that this power is OP, but thats not the case as you will see. He fears death,it hurts, at times he feels and seems powerless, its only throught the friendships that he has made that he pulls through. Overall my favorite series of 2016 and easily in my top 5 animes ever.\\n\r\nAccording to the creator the web novel is only half way there. So we can expect 3 more seasons ( of course only if they are greenlit). So with that in mind i would suggest you watch it ASAP",

The main character, ripped from his home world and having to start from zero, faces a great deal of adversity throughout the story. As opposed to other stories where the main character is either naturally skilled or somehow surpasses expectations with no degree of difficulty, Subaru must overcome his failures. \r\nHardly anybody likes to fail. Failure, especially after you've exerted a great amount of energy, can sometimes damage one's self-confidence. Humans, being as imperfect as we are, arealso prone to errors. It is not our failures or our mistakes that define us, but the actions that we take to make a change after we've recognized our shortcomings.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero does a brilliant job at capturing this essential ingredient of human nature: allowing the main character to fail (perhaps more than he succeeds) and at times succumbing to the overwhelming emotions that pain a person after a profound loss. Although the conclusion of the series might have some loose ends that were never completely tied up, the story is still this series' strong point. There were times of laughter, tears, and utter shock, as Re:Zero pulls the audience in with relatable characters, a stunning original sound track, jam-packed action sequences, and several moments of deep horror. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development was strong in such a way that it was easy to relate to multiple characters and watch their relationships solidify throughout the series. Whether it be the main character overcoming his trials or the relationships between a handful of characters, there is definite development and it is implemented in a beautiful way. One of the best performances of the show was done by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, who plays the character Petelgeuse. While some people are of the view that Petelgeuse was over-dramatized, I am of the view that this super-villain makes the Joker from Batman look cute and gentle. All episodes featuring Petelgeuse sent a shiver down my spine and accomplished something that few other anime have been able to pull off.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the animation quality is not of the same grade like what you'd see from a ufotable production or of Madoka Magica caliber, the animators without question paid attention to details and did an outstanding job with the action sequences. There were of course some errors that I could nitpick -- ranging from some \"copy and pasted village characters\" to blood being on a character's face one moment and then disappeared the next -- the errors are trivial and the animation as a whole is good.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the animation might lack at times, the sound more than makes up for it. The sound director and sound effects definitely deserve a lot of praise here. Featuring a rich OST, the songs are the type that stick around with you for days after watching the anime and the effects are executed to near perfection.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who adores Steins;Gate for its thrill, Spice&Wolf for its character dynamics, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni for its horror, Madoka Magica for its dark deconstruction, Clannad:AS for its depiction of overcoming adversity, and Kara no Kyoukai for its dark action scenes, it should be clear just how much I enjoyed Re:Zero. One could argue that Re:Zero successfully borrows each element from the previously listed anime -- some of which people consider masterpieces -- and it is for this reasoning why I have rated Re:Zero so highly and among one of my all-time favorite anime. \\n\\n\r\nThere are of course some flaws that should be pointed out, as nothing is perfect. As the series stands and without knowing if there will be a second season, the viewer as an \"anime-only\" watcher will be left with a handful of questions relating to the overall storyline that were left unanswered. If one has followed the source material and has read beyond the anime, some are likely to be dissatisfied with how Re:Zero ended as it currently stands. Although it is understandable that discarding an important scene toward the end of the anime can leave the viewer feeling disappointed, White Fox adapted the source material on the whole faithfully. \\n\\n\r\nIf one can overlook some minor flaws in the animation and the story, it is very easy to rank this anime highly alongside the other gems out there. I will definitely be voting with my dollar and supporting Re:Zero in every way that I can in hopes of seeing a Season 2 adapted someday. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would highly recommend Re:Zero to anyone looking for a combination of an adventure, thriller, fantasy, action, comedy, and romance. It's a great show that is definitely re-watchable and I look forward to owning the blu-rays.",

At first, I thought so, I didn't expect too much for this anime. I thought that, \"Seriously, Isekai again? This is boring!\" but I tried to watch this series because my friend recommended this to me. At first cour, it just like a common anime fantasy, the problem is not that big. It's just like a slice-of-live anime, with shit protagonist. I thought that his ability is cheating, he could revive from dead and change his fate, and I thought that in last, hewill suddenly overpowered with power of despair. But then, I was wrong.\\n\r\nThe second cour is great, it give me speechless. The problem is too big for him to handle with that weak power that he has, it makes me so curious, what resolution will be, what will he do to fix his situation, hi fails again and again, experiencing despair, and almost run from his situation. But then, the supporting character did her role as it should be. I never think that the first cour would give a very important plot to the story. And then, his resolution give me speechless again. This is so great! I recommend this for you!\\n\r\nThough, the ending haven't completed yet, but it's quite good compared to the cliff hanger ending in another anime adaptation. Well, it's because ... I Love Emilia!!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 (1st cour), 9 (2nd cour)\\n\r\nOveral: 10",

            "content": "Ok before i start this is my 1st review\r\nFirstly here is a brief summary of Re:zero\r\nRe:zero is about male protagonist Natsuki Subaru (voiced by Kobayashi, Yuusuke) who is an 18 year old NEET who gets transported in to another world, (quite a common setting in a majority of anime however with a unique twist) after a visit to the convenience store, he is later saved by a beautiful silver haired elf after being mugged by a group of street thugs, he gets to know his savior who names herself Satella for a bit until they are both killed. However unknowingly Subaru has the ability \"Returnby Death\" to go back in time and change the future event from ever happening.\\n\\n\r\nStory(9): Now the story is mainly focused on Subaru attempting to save his savior(Emilia) from dieing and later on helping her achieve her goal however she doesn't really show much gratitude as Subaru is still a kind of stranger to her who she helped when he was in need, nothing more, nothing less, there is isn't a lot of sceentine for Emilia however she us seen quite a bit early on and definitely near the end.\\n\r\nWARNING!\\n\r\nThere are many waifu's so be prepared for the MAL salt.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9): The scenary in this anime is amazing in my opinion, every scene is appealing to the eyes and the art is overall spectacular though a few parts may look a bit low near the end due to saving budget for specific scenes but are still not really anything to be salty about.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10): This is one of my favorites, the music in this especially the OSTS are amazing, they all fit the moment and are perfectly used, the OPs and EDs are catchy and the anime has many soundtracks made just for a moment in the episode and are one of my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(10): The character development is done very well and you can tell how much the MC, main and quite a few supporting characters grow, this anime focuses quite a bit on the supporting cast which is what i love, especially Whilhem Van Astrea, Felis and Crusch, the voice actors do a magnificent job especially in those emotional scenes, you can really feel the character's pain and suffering, Betelgeuse is the best VA of the year no doubt about that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10): I loved this series from start to finish, it did not feel rushed what so ever and i have already rewatched this series 3 times and counting. I would definitely reccomend this anime especially to those who love a dark fantasy thriller setting.\\n\r\n(According to LN readers this is only the prologue 10-15% of the story)\\n\r\nSo expect a second season in a few years time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(10): Personally this have been one of my favorite anime's of all time, everything is done so well and im really impressed at how well the VAs have done, definitely in my top 3 anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS IS NOT SAME AS SAO WHAT SO EVER!\\n\r\nFor the people who relate this masterpiece to trash, i don't know what is the same or how it even feels the same, everything you here about this being a a generic harem with plain characters is all bs from the haters, i recommend ignoring them and for you to personally enjoy it, if you don't fair enough but don't be a troll like the others.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, let me know if you enjoyed my first review, id be happy to do more.",

            "content": "HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT! These words and I'm sure plenty of other words have been used by me and other viewers to describe our feelings for this show. There is in my opinion NOTHING else like this show in how it paces and draws the audience in through a captivating story, the immense dynamic relationships between characters which challenges societal norms, and ultimately a brilliant yet subtle intertwining and overarching plotline. I'm going to go over 5 reasons why this show has become my number 1 show of all time. (fyi this is long, analytical and has spoilers)\r\n1.) The Plotline\r\nOriginally, Re:zero was writtenoff as a generic \"Mmorpg new world\" type of anime. It tried too hard to be funny like Konosuba in its first two episodes and lacked the same punch and light-hearted ironic tone that Konosuba did so well. Yet what we see on face value is not what actually develops over time. Re:zero is NOT like any spinoff we have ever seen and in fact, is possibly the most successful adaptation of this \"mc in new world\" genre. \\n\\n\r\n(SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD) - With a very basic summary, Re:zero is about a NEET, Natsuki Subaru, who finds himself in a new world. Like traditional anime tropes, he believes he is the protagonist of this world and now must save the world from some sort of evil. He quickly finds out two things. First, that his enemy is ultimately the Witch Satella and her cults. Second, after meeting the main girl protagonist, Emilia, he has an obligation as the mc of this world to help her so she can fall in love with him and regain political power, in a different struggle to find a candidate to lead the kingdom. \\n\\n\r\nPretty basic stuff. Yet what Re:zero excels at is creating such a generic plotline into a complex and realistic atmosphere. The twist here, is that the mc, Subaru, has the ability to come back alive to a certain point in his life before he was killed. Essentially, he can return by death to some sort of \"savepoint\" to change his future as a result of his knowledge and actions in his previous life. \\n\\n\r\nIt is simply fascinating to see and understand how Subaru operates in this world as he tries to understand the rules, the mannerisms, and the customs  in order to fit in and be able to change the world. In a sense, Re:zero is a trial and error process for Subaru and with each life that he loses comes with both a benefit and a price. For benefits, Subaru gains another important set of knowledge that helps him in his next life to make better rational decisions to achieve his goal and desirable outcome. Yet, remember that death is not something to blow over. In fact, one of the big themes of this anime is how death actually would affect someone like yourself in real life. What type of psychological damage does Subaru incur? What type of emotions does he feel after having to rebuild his relationships back up every-time only to fail and have to do it again? How much mental-fortitude can you sustain before you break because your efforts have been in vain? These are the themes that Re:zero deals with quite effectively. White Fox does a great job in doing this both explicitly through Subaru's increase of rational and intelligent actions while also implicitly as we see a change in his personality overtime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing the show excels at is pacing and setting up an actual nuanced and intriguing plotline. Re:zero takes many of the generic plot devices (i.e. Seven Deadly Sins) and symbols and spins it in a way that keeps the watchers hooked. After each arc, more and more of the plot is revealed and shows how deep and involved the conflicts really are even in everyday life for commoners. Every episode is incredibly important in setting up the next one and each detail is important insofar that it comes back or relates to something else. Furthermore, this plot actually deals with and interacts with the characters in a meaningful and realistic manner. Racism and other discriminatory practices are blatantly shown as a primary incentive and impact of many characters. Like the real world, there are everyday conflicts between people and they have consequences. People don't just forget and don't judge in the real world. They do. Re:zero exploits this because often times other shows are unwilling to be bold and accept this truth. \\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers) As more of the plot is revealed, we begin to see how this story comes full circle a little bit at a time. The mc is here for a reason. Re:zero isn't simply a story about finding love and defeating the bad guys. It's about a story of self-discovery and change. When you see the nuances of the mc and his power Return by Death and how that is actually linked to the witch, the plotline inadvertently  becomes so much more fascinating. Is Subaru actually Pride and a part of the Witch's cult? Will he eventually turn against Emilia? Is Satella simply a manifestation of what is wrong with people? This is the narrative that Re:zero challenges the audience on and that is what makes this show so great. Nothing is as easy as it seems and nothing is safe. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing to note is that during the last episode of the show when Betelguese is chasing down Subaru in the cart, he (Betelguese) says things eerily similar to Subaru. What we see is that while motives can be perceived good or bad by the audience, ultimately every character can be considered rational and relatable. In fact, Betelguese's emphatic love for Satella drives him to carry out her orders and do what he does in the name of love. Similarly, Subaru does the same for Emilia. She is his love and he will do what he thinks benefits her. This interplay and dialogue between the protagonists and antagonists actually reveals a far more intertwined plot line between the protagonists and the antagonists. I would personally love to see a season 2 that develops this even more.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure there are plenty of other things I can talk about that I'm not mentioning in this review as well as expanding more upon those that I did. But at the end of the day take away three things about the plotline for re:zero\\n\\n\r\nIt's engaging, it's nuanced/complex and it's realistic/relatable.\\n\\n\r\n2.) Character Development\\n\\n\r\nThree things I want to talk about in this review: humanism/realism, the cycle of character building and why it's so unique to Re:zero, the impact of dialogue as a mechanism of creating organic change. \\n\\n\r\nFirst on humanism and the development of relatable characters. I think what anime in general has a habit of doing especially in the genre that Re:zero falls under is provide a mc as well as supporting characters that is unrealistic (i.e. SAO, Log Horizon etc.). When you do so, you target the classic niche anime community (which hey is a corporate incentive) where typical NEETs can fantasize about. Everyone wants to be overpowered. Everyone wants to get the girl. Everyone wants to be the protagonist and save the world from evil. This isn't realistic. No one is the main character in the world and your actions when you act like one has consequences. People will not simply accept that you are better than them. You need to develop your image and reputation with one of respect and credibility for people to trust you. This is how the world works and this is the basis of how Re:zero operates. I personally believe that many anime are too afraid to challenge the norms and question the very way our reality works. This was a new and refreshing change of pace that ultimately worked effectively.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does this look like? For the mc, Subaru, I believe that his actions and the way his personality has evolved over the show provides a reasonable picture of what would happen if I were in his shoes.  In the beginning after Emilia shows up, it's very obvious that Subaru believes he is the white knight. He has to save Emilia, win over her love, and save the world. Who wouldn't want to believe that after being transported to a realm that you have no clue about? However, after using his ability Return by Death, we slowly see the darkness that is in every human: fear, savagery, detest, jealousy, envy etc. Death is no simple thing. Often times, anime blows this way out of proportion and simply slides it under the rug. Death goes against every fiber of our living body. We are built to survive and ultimately to help ourselves. \\n\\n\r\nFor every death that Subaru encounters, it slowly erodes his soul and his personality. The first major arc focuses mostly on how Subaru can use his actions to change the future in a \"parallel\" or different world. He learns and adapts quickly to the situation and in fact willing dies to reset. Yet, among this arc we see constant foreshadowing of a deeper problem ingrained in Subaru: his emphatic and sometimes unrealistic devotion to Emilia. In the next arc, we see the beginning of the \"true suffering\" - the development of the \"suffaru.\" The 2nd arc primarily deals with the backlash and the psychological damage of dying. At the point where Subaru cannot express any of his emotions and his struggles to anyone in any lifetime, this burden ultimately is too much for one single being. This is realistic. Too many times, do main characters disregard death or their own abilities as inconsequential. They use what they have to change the world around them without actually questioning their motives or their sanity along the way. Re:zero explicitly shows the impact of what happens when a person goes through consistent traumatic experiences and how it affects you. This is what would happen to you if you were Subaru, an ordinary person.\\n\\n\r\nSecond on the cycle of character building. As mentioned already, Re:zero specifically focuses on Subaru and how his actions are perceived and interpreted by others. Recognize that Subaru is not the only actor in this world and that everyone else is affected by his supposedly irrational actions. Why are they irrational? Because he cannot talk to anyone about his ability, he has to assume to some degree that they can understand him somehow. There is simply no other way for him to stay sane. He needs to believe that they understand that he is trying to help them without actually conveying it to them. The problem is, is that one when Subaru never talks, no one actually knows his motives and intentions. This is realistic. Second, often times his actions seem irrational because he simply knows more than he should. Why does he want to take Emilia with him to somewhere else? Can she actually trust him? At the point in which Subaru gives no explanation, the only course of action is to psychologically break down. \\n\\n\r\nThis is unique to Re:Zero. By episodes 10-15 roughly, most viewers hate Subaru for what he is becoming. He is becoming a detestable, selfish and loathsome mc which is unappealing to most audiences. However, I see that as a way that the story is challenging the standard narrative in these shows and in reality. Why is the show suddenly so cringeworthy and hard to watch? It's because it breaks down the facade that is society. Everyone puts on a good face but at its core we human beings have dark emotions. When the show explicitly presents us with a realistic adaptation of what would happen in these situations, we must confront ourselves. Are we like that? Or we are not? \\n\\n\r\nThis cycle of building, breaking down characters only to rebuild them and remold them differently is extremely new and refreshing. Most shows take 5 steps forward, 1 step back (usually because of someone's death), and then another 5 steps forward. This doesn't always seem reasonable. At the point which death is probably the most traumatic experience one can have, the average person is probably far more affected than it is  portrayed in most shows. Subaru takes 5 steps forward, each a smaller step, falls and slides down and finally picks himself up again on a different more effective staircase. Overall, Re:zero is probably the only show ever to truly break down a character at its core after building it up a certain way only to remold them into a different person with a similar set of values. This sort of nuance is not any other show I've watched\\n\\n\r\nFinally on to dialogue and why it's so effective in Re:zero. I think in most shows dialogue is rarely used realistically. If the main character is feeling down, generally someone comes up to him, says a few words about how it's not his fault and how he has to believe in himself to keep moving forward. And that's about how they solve any sort of internal crisis. Re:zero doesn't do this. Instead, they take more time in developing interesting and complex arguments that are realistic. During Subaru's breakdown with Emilia, their dialogue is extremely reminiscent of their previous actions. They explain themselves to the best they can just like people would. They understand their own incentives and motives. Putting a band-aid on a break in consciousness does not suddenly fix it. Re:zero resolves these issues in meaningful and realistic ways. The supporting characters are literally there to support the mc (i.e. Rem best girl). Re:zero dedicates almost 2 and a half episodes solely on the recovery of Subaru with the help of Rem. In fact, they spend a whole episode having Subaru talk with Rem over his problems. Their dialogue gets to the real crux of the problem and ultimately resolves the issue. \\n\\n\r\nRe:zero shows and tells. It shows you why and how people behave when they break and they tell you how you get back up. You don't get back up with a few words and a pat on the back. You get it after you have meaningful and long discussions about the root problems and how to fix it. \\n\\n\r\n3.)  The voice acting\\n\\n\r\nPlenty of other shows have had exceptional voice acting and Re:Zero is no different. This show has been the only show in my entire life that I have watched both anime and Western tv series that has emotionally charged me to the point of getting chills. I have never resonated so much with anyone else and their struggles.\\n\\n\r\nYuusuke Kobayashi, the VA for Subaru, is perfect for the role. He exemplifies both the inflection and tone during crucial parts of the show. Particularly, when in episode 7 when Ram kills him and questions \"What have I ever done to you for you to hate me,\" in episode 12 or 13 when Subaru breaks down in front of Emilia, episode 15 when Subaru roars with anger to Betelgeues after he kills Rem, \"I will kill you,\" and finally in episode 18 when he talks to Rem about his feelings. Every scene that should be emotional is emotional because of the actors. Every action and word that should be charged with either sadness or pure anger is done so. \\n\\n\r\nParticularly Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, the VA for Betelguese, is fantastic. Despite being the mc for a completely different anime Shokugeki no Souma with a completely different taste, he absolutely nails the main arc 3 antagonist. The speed and inflection and the arbitrary emphasis on certain words exemplifies the insanity of Betelguese effectively. Re: zero is definitely not short on excellent VAs and they did an excellent job portraying humanistic elements and emotions in the show\\n\\n\r\n4.) The animation/directing\\n\\n\r\nUnbelievable. White Fox Studio absolutely nailed it. Everyone praises them for adapting the show accurately and it's true. They truly hit the mark on the spot. In fact, many times they were so dedicated in providing the material and the content that they eliminated the opening and ending or even extended the length of the episode to give the viewers the best possible experience. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is crisp and clean. I think the animators did a fantastic job showing the fight scenes as well as displaying scale (i.e. the White whale). Furthermore, much of the lighting and use of backgrounds is often used to foreshadow or to emphasize the mood of the story. There were no lapses of bad animation quality and it was consistent throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the choice of words was super important in the show. When people say words like \"aishiteimasu,\" it has far more meaning than the english sub would make it seem. In english, I love you is pretty the strongest emotional words you can get. In Japanese however, there are many ways to say I love you. In fact, most shows say \"daisuki or ashiteru.\" These are much less powerful forms of love in the sense that they are more casual. If you say \"aishiteimasu,\" to someone, you better be breaking out the ring soon. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the production studio explicitly uses language as means to achieve a certain understanding, it demonstrates the willingness to go that extra step. White Fox Productions is dedicated to this show and uses any sort of mechanism to further the plot and the characters. In this sense, the directors have a great idea of direction and how to get there in the most effective way possible. \\n\\n\r\n5.) The Music \\n\\n\r\nThe music in Re:Zero is spectacular. The serious tones during the serious moments as well as the light hearted ones during more cheerful times. One thing that really stuck out was that the show used a variety of different types of music and styles. For example, at the end of episode 15, they use a very beautiful yet solemn elegy for Rem as the credits rolled up on the screen. White Fox was willing to experiment and see what worked and what didn't\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, they nailed the timing down for when to put music and when not to. The silences were extremely effective at bringing out the suspense and mystery. During around episode 21 and 22 when Subaru and company go off to fight the White Whale, the sound of the 1980s ringtone was incredibly eerily. White Fox productions literally went out and searched for the actual phone type and its ringtone in real-life rather than creating it inside its music production studio. This level of dedication is so unique and is really effective only in Re: zero\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Re:zero comes out to be a unique and refreshing experience. Its complex plot, nuanced characters, and challenge of societal norms provides intelligent discourse and conversations about what it means to be human and how can we be better? With the special attention to animation, directing, acting and music, Re:zero simply nails home the whole package.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr watch the show. It's fantastic on all levels.",

            "content": "Re:Zero\u2026 OUT OF TEN AMIRIGHT???? AYYYYY SMASH THAT HELPFUL BUTTON FAM THANKS FOR READING MY RE:VIEW EXTENDING THIS REVIEW TO REACH THE MINIMUM LENGTH EXTENDING THIS REVIEW TO REACH THE MINIMUM LENGTH EXTENDING THIS REVIEW TO REACH THE MINIMUM LENGTH EXTENDING THIS REVIEW TO REACH THE MINIMUM LENGTH EXTENDING THIS REVIEW TO REACH THE MINIMUM LENGTH\r\nI couldn\u2019t find a good way to seamlessly write this review, because there are just too many things to talk about here. (Also I got really busy around the time I needed to write this.) So, instead, I broke it down into points. If you want to skip any ofthem, here\u2019s a small list.\\n\\n\r\n1. First impressions, and my general tastes\\n\r\n2. The main character, Natsuki Subaru\\n\r\n3. The other characters\\n\r\n4. The pRe:Duction (Art&Sound)\\n\r\n5. The story as a whole\\n\r\n5A. Arc 1\\n\r\n5B. Arc 2\\n\r\n5C. Arc 3\\n\r\n6. What I liked and didn\u2019t like\\n\\n\r\nOverall scoring is at the bottom. The subsections of #5 are kinda spoilery, so I recommend avoiding those if you haven\u2019t yet seen this show.\\n\\n\r\n1. First impressions, and my general tastes\\n\r\nFirst off, I like this new \u201cisekai\u201d genre, this new type of series where some kid gets sucked into a fantasy world, game or not. I think it\u2019s a fun idea that has a lot of room for exploration and offers a lot of freedom while carrying its own interesting ideas by just being a game or something. Unfortunately, a lot of shows like Sword Art Online and Overlord give this genre a bad rep for being shit, but I still think that this \u201cgenre\u201d can shit out a good show at any given moment.\\n\r\nWhen Re:Zero started, I thought it was a fun time because the main character was a little bit like Kazuma of KonoSuba, which had just ended weeks prior at the time. Granted, the show was nothing close to KonoSuba due to its dark tone, but I still thought it was gonna be fun, and the dark twist in Return by Death was really interesting. I wasn\u2019t calling it the anime of the season right away, but I did believe it had potential to improve. It certainly did, and that\u2019s exciting for me.\\n\r\nI certainly recommend this for any fan of the isekai \u201cgenre\u201d. And while it isn\u2019t meta-busting like KonoSuba, the main character is a deconstruction of the typical main characters of these shows.\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the next thing\u2026\\n\\n\r\n2. The main character, Natsuki Subaru\\n\r\nThis reckless faggot has been a bit of a controversy throughout Re:tarded\u2019s run, especially in the second cour. Personally, I enjoyed watching him. He\u2019s a very flawed character, but for good reasons, and if you can\u2019t figure them out then the show will explain them eventually. For example, one of Toyota\u2019s most annoying habits was how excitable he was after reviving. In actuality, he\u2019s just faking it because he doesn\u2019t want to remember how fucking terrifying it is to die. The third arc is when Nissan hits rock bottom and his character goes from annoying to flat-out ridiculous and cringe-worthy. Re:Shit doesn\u2019t explain that in this way, but it\u2019s because he gets over-confident due to surviving the first two arcs, and also because he thinks he\u2019s the main character of a video game. That\u2019s kinda why Re:Overrated deconstructs the shitty NEET protagonists, because they\u2019re always supposed to be the great OP hero who gets all the bitches, but instead Barusu is as much of a useless fuckwad in this world as he was in the real world, so he must use what little strengths he has to make a big impact. \\n\r\nIf you want an anime where the protagonist\u2019s actions always have strong consequences and undergoes a large rise and fall, Re:Pleb has that.\\n\\n\r\n3. The other characters\\n\r\nThis is probably where Re:Crap struggles the most, as it definitely doesn\u2019t have a strong supporting cast. Most of the side characters are heavily underdeveloped, especially the main not-best girl Megumilia. Or, just Emilia for short. She at least serves her purpose as Mazda\u2019s love interest, but her general lack of anything noteworthy makes it a little hard to agree with at times. More on that in 5C. There is at least one major side character that got some good development, though, and that is Rem. If you haven\u2019t heard that name at least 653 times within the last three months, then you must live under a very uncomfortable rock, or you didn\u2019t lose your religion. But I\u2019m gonna be honest\u2026 Rem is not a very strong character. She\u2019s not even the best girl of this show. Why? Because that\u2019s literally what she was written to be. Rem\u2019s entire character is \u201cbest girl\u201d. Everything she says and does, even the way she looks, it\u2019s all what you\u2019d want from the \u201cbest girl\u201d. Sorry, Rem fans, but\u2026 she really is just a huge piece of waifubait. But at least it worked, I guess.\\n\r\nAnyway, that said, I didn\u2019t dislike anyone from the show, either. REEEEE:Zero is still a fun show at heart, so there\u2019s still a lot of energy with the supporting cast despite the lack of development. But if you really want a memorable supporting cast, then you\u2019re probably gonna wait for the other 20,000 seasons or however many seasons this fucking long ass novel series is gonna generate. \\n\r\nThere\u2019s still some good news, though: it\u2019s not a harem. Yes, it\u2019s a light novel with girls, and the main character is a guy. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a goddamn harem.\\n\\n\r\n4. The pRe:Duction (Art&Sound)\\n\r\nIt\u2019s fucking great. Seriously, White Fox must\u2019ve put everything they have to offer as a studio into this. While many twelve-episode shows falter in animation quality after four or five episodes, Re:Budget looks consistently stellar throughout twenty-five. As an action series, this features some intense, well-choreographed fights that can even last multiple episodes with little downtime. Beyond that, some good direction with timely visual effects, facial expressions, and good shot compositions and lighting can make the non-action-y scenes interesting to watch. Even aesthetically, it looks great, with its massive capital setting, and some rather elaborate character designs that dip their toes into the land of fanservice, but not too much. If anything, I\u2019m actually rather impressed by the lack of fanservice in Re:Fearow. The only thing that I can complain about is the use of CG for the background characters in the capital. Since it\u2019s a big city, there needs to be a lot of people, or\u2026 creatures. There are certainly a lot of them, making it look like an actual city, but they\u2019re animated with some pretty shitty CG, which breaks the immersion a bit. Unfortunately, this is just a lose-lose situation for White Fox, because no one wants to spend a bunch of time animating useless characters in the background, but if they removed them or simply didn\u2019t animate them, the city wouldn\u2019t feel real. In this case, I\u2019ll just appreciate what they attempted. CG:Zero still looks incredible.\\n\r\nAnd this goes hand-in-hand with the outstanding voice acting. I don\u2019t know who the fuck Yusuke Kobayashi is or how he got the role of Mitsubishi, but I\u2019m glad he did. This character is intense and super emotional, with a ton of screaming and crying and all that edgy goodness, and he makes it sound completely natural. Someone give this guy a fucking cupcake or something. Similar praise can be said for Inori Minase, even though she once played Hestia, who still haunts me to this very day. But in this case, she played Rem, another edgy character who has a tendency to scream and cry a lot. There\u2019s also Rie Takahashi, who plays Emilia. Her voice is adorable. That\u2019s all. But my absolute favorite was Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, aka that one guy who voiced Kirito. Holy shit, what a performance he gives as Betelgeuse. I already loved him for his dynamic voice and quick timing, but this might actually be his best role yet. And that\u2019s a guy who\u2019s had a prolific career already.\\n\r\nThe first OP is one I especially love, and it\u2019s not just because Konomi Suzuki can fucking sing. I also just love how the song itself dips up and down a few times before finally making a big landing. It\u2019s very characteristic of the series, and the creepy, mysterious visuals that accompany it help. The second OP is by Myth&Roid, who\u2019ve only been around for a year but have already made some of my favorite ED\u2019s\u2026 including the first ED of this show. And also the insert songs in episodes 7 and 14, which are intense as hell. But back to the OP; it\u2019s very mediocre visually, but the song is interesting. It had to grow on me, but it does a good job at setting the unsettling tone of the third arc. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s interesting to note, though, that most episodes don\u2019t actually play the OP or ED with their visuals. Sometimes you\u2019ll get one or the other, sometimes you\u2019ll get neither, and sometimes the ED song will play over a scene, making it very difficult to follow along with because I\u2019m busy belting out \u201cSTAAAAAAEEAAAAAEEAAAAEEAAAAEEAAAAYYY AAAAALIIIIIVE\u201d like a fucking Muse, but there were only two episodes (8 & 20) that played both the OP and the ED with their visuals. White Fox, more often than not, will cut one or both of them out to make room for more of a scene, even if it\u2019s only an extra minute-thirty. This isn\u2019t revolutionary or anything, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen this method used so many times in one show before. It\u2019s a pretty cool thing of them to do, as it makes the credit themes feel a bit more special.\\n\r\nAlso, the soundtrack is good but is exceptional in its action themes and not so much in its in-between themes. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say because I spent a little too long on this section, probably.\\n\\n\r\nNow I\u2019ll get into the actual story.\\n\\n\r\n5. The story as a whole\\n\r\nRe:Stay/Night is an interesting take on the isekai genre, as the main character returns to a certain point in time upon dying, while also retaining the events that took place before his death. Obviously, he\u2019ll use this power to his advantage, with each life being a learning experience until he eventually clears some invisible mission and moves the checkpoint forward. I do really like how they play with this mechanic a bit, because it develops Honda\u2019s character in several different ways. The power itself has great advantages, but can also be extremely terrifying, because\u2026 well, dying probably doesn\u2019t feel very good, especially when it\u2019s from having your throat ripped out. \\n\r\nThis anime is very dark and edgy, especially in its third arc\u2026 honestly, I think that\u2019s for the better. Arc 3\u2019s main villain is incredibly over-the-top and just utterly ridiculous, but it makes sense that way. Isuzu will reset everything, so what he experiences needs to have a heavier impact, so that he can erase the result, but he\u2019ll still be traumatized by it. \\n\r\nBut I do want to say that I don\u2019t like Re:Edge specifically because it was edgy. I think the writing was pretty great at several points, and I love what was going on with Yamaha. I think episodes 11-13 and 16 are very underrated because they present some great drama that exploits his flaws to their fullest.\\n\\n\r\n5A. Arc 1\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much to say about this arc because it sets up the story. It hints that something darker is in the works, but aside from some gruesome deaths, it doesn\u2019t tread that ground just yet. Instead it sticks to a more playful side to kinda let the viewer\u2019s guard down, so that when it does finally get dark, it\u2019ll have a bigger impact. About half of it is just fighting, anyway. \\n\\n\r\n5B. Arc 2\\n\r\nThis could actually be the least interesting arc, because it\u2019s rather slow and presents a great idea for the story, but doesn\u2019t follow through. Carjoke#9105 has to figure out who killed him as he lives with a bunch of weirdos in a dope mansion; with the Return by Death ability, it\u2019s easy to set up a mystery scenario. But instead, that element is just kinda shrugged off and they reveal the killer without much leading up to it. It just kinda happens, but that\u2019s not the entire arc. There\u2019s more beyond that which I won\u2019t spoil, but it ends with a long and exciting fight and features some good character development all-around, even if it\u2019s still not a whole lot for some characters. \\n\\n\r\n5C. Arc 3\\n\r\nThis one\u2019s weird, because there\u2019s a lot of good and a lot of not good. This section is also gonna be pretty spoiler-y. ...So, spoilers below.\\n\\n\r\nThis arc takes the story in a new direction by giving us a look at the political world. This is something I like, except\u2026 there\u2019s absolutely no point to it. After Balls goes full Balls, the story goes back to being a festival of madness, with no regard to all this political bullshit. All that can be taken from this big setup is that some new characters were introduced. Except they were already introduced by other means: Felis and Wilhelm came to Roswaal\u2019s mansion, therefore leading up to an easy introduction to Crusch; that one bitch with the nice appas needed Subaru to handle her appas, etc. All of the story threads that come from episodes 12 and 13 could\u2019ve been drawn in a different way without changing the result of what happens afterwards. Yes, yes, this will all be relevant again\u2026 in another season. Great.\\n\r\nAnother big thing about this arc is the great Rem vs. Emilia debate, something that I like to call \u201cWorld War III\u201d. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, this isn\u2019t another shitty \u201crem best girl 2016\u201d post, because I actually defend Subaru\u2019s unbreakable love. Really, it\u2019s not hard to understand why he loves Emilia. She\u2019s nice\u2026 she\u2019s beautiful\u2026 she has a great rack\u2026 she uses magic\u2026 she saved his life\u2026 she has a great rack\u2026 she\u2019s voiced by Megumin\u2026 she has a great rack\u2026 she has a furry pussy, and so on. When you have your sights set on something, it\u2019s hard to look away. But I get it, this is kinda like trying to swallow an apple whole, and that\u2019s because Emilia has no personality beyond what I said. I wasn\u2019t being that vague or simplistic, either, she\u2019s just\u2026 a nice person. Rem is everything that you could get out of Emilia, but like thirty times better, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s hard for people to accept this ship.\\n\r\nAnd overall, I think this arc was super hype for a while, but episode 15 was the peak for sure, meaning the following 10 episodes weren\u2019t as great. I still think it had a decent ending, though, disregarding anything that the light novel readers are saying.\\n\\n\r\n6. What I liked and didn\u2019t like\\n\r\nTo basically summarize, I appreciate the ideas this show presents and often thought they were presented well. Other times, they weren\u2019t exactly implemented badly\u2026 they just weren\u2019t implemented at all, such as the mystery in the second arc. \\n\r\nStill, I didn\u2019t mind the story\u2019s fuck-ups so much because I still thought it had a really interesting story to tell, and some of the shit that happens just shook me to the core. Re:Zero really was one of the most enjoyable shows I\u2019ve seen in a while; it demanded my undivided attention, earned it, and now I walk away from it with a lot of respect. Though I understand it has its flaws, I\u2019m here to appreciate what it did, and I\u2019m very happy with what I got.\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all this review is about.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Crusch best girl faggots.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nRem - 4/10\\n\r\nOverall - 8.5 (Range: 7-9)\\n\r\nRecommendation level - High\\n\r\nFavorite episodes - 7, 15, 16\\n\r\nFavorite character - not rem",

            "content": "After watching the whole series,i decided to write a review about this amazing show.\r\nSo basically in the beginning : A character named Natsuki Subaru went on a new Fantasy world, containing powers, a medieval and lovely place. Buying some stuffed at a market by blinking his eyes in the real world,more precisely in Japan was his traveled method. After failing miserably by trying to save someone, Subaru finally understood that he didn't possess any power at all... That what he though on the beginning. A torturous loop happen again and again where he died, after finally founding happiness and a beautiful girl who saved her,and Subaru understand after his second death that he possess not really a power,but instead a curse : Return by Death. \\n\\n\r\nSubaru as a neet still possess a huge strength in hand combats, letting him kicking the ass of three street thugs, wearing a huge weapons and also act really fast on his feet, which means he is not fully hopeless. He also possess some courage, but broke up after some dramatic death and it's totally under-stable.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this story will showed you a new and more serious Kono suba !\\n\\n\r\nSo, do you like watching the main character suffering and growing up? \\n\r\nDo you like amazing music ? Amazing opening and ending ?\\n\r\nDo you like comedy? Do you like Tragedy? Do you like crying and feeling happy after watching a episode ? Then, Re:Zero is for you.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is interesting, but could have been explained better. It's still have some great plot twist, and the cliffhanger are ALWAYS present.\\n\r\nSome awesome scene were skipped from the Light novel, which i don't understand why. Maybe because they doesn't had enough time ? But still. It's really a shame for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, but some scenes possess too much camera shaking, which reduce the enjoyment i had.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, i also like the design of each character, and the CGI made the world around alive. The flashback were also really well place in each scene, and some face of Subaru are so well drawn when he goes wrong, you really feel disturb when need by watching it.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the last episode of the series were becoming worse with the arts, maybe because they were starting to lack of budget and time. But it was still great overall !\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was really something wonderful and powerful. It's the typical music that bring you tears of joy, and put some tingles on your back. The track of Re:Zero could even reach some level of music movies !\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOh god, the Character are soooo amazing ! I love them all so much. They all have something interesting that i like. \\n\\n\r\nNatsuki Subaru : Oh god, his voice. Some people find him annoying, but i love hearing him. The voice actor put and awesome job on him.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Natsuki Subaru always changed and surprised me.\\n\\n\r\nWell, i find all voice in this show really good, thumbs up for all the voice actor !\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen i'm watching and anime and realizing that i have to wait one more week to see another episode, it's mean for me that i really enjoyed this.\\n\\n\r\nEverything was well done perfectly to make me enjoyed more and more each episode, White fox did and awesome job.\\n\\n\r\nLike i said before, the cliffhanger are always present, along with amazing soundtrack. I feel hype at every episode !\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was a great surprise, and i don't regret watching it even with the negative comment about it.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is truly a masterpiece for me, and nobody can make me change my though about it. It's true that it contain some lack, but overall it doesn't matter for me. One of the best anime that i watched.\\n\\n\r\nEverybody rating it shit are of course some people who doesn't watch it seriously and though it was a harem by looking at the main picture, it's truly a shame.\\n",

            "content": "*The Following Review is something that I messaged to a friend of mine and it turned out to be something like a Review , I did not plan to make a Review but typing all of this for just one message just for one person seems like a waste so here are my thoughts*\r\n1.Realism\r\nI know you must be thinking right now , What? really are you kidding me?? Yea but Remember Re Zero is based on a 'what if?' Scenario .. So aside from that if you look closely , The Interactions of characters , The way they act gives realism to the story ..The way subaru acts greedy , scared , Bluffs , Tries to act overly cool is something anyone would do in front of someone they just meet to keep a good impression (Espeicially Emilia) ..\\n\\n\r\n2.Dialogue\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about Re Zero , Since its adapted from a Light Novel .. It has a key feature called Dialogue.. Ep 18 and Ep 25 had one of the most well written and Legendary Dialogues which should go down in History but unfortunately anime is not as mainstream like Shakespheres books right? Aside from those two episodes also were good Dialogues\\n\\n\r\n3.Contrast in Animation\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is usually bright and colorful but during the dark moments the colours dull down and blends perfectly with that environment , Whats more is that the sound compliments it and makes it great work..\\n\\n\r\n4.ALL THE OPENINGS ,ENDINGS , And INSERT SONGS!!!\\n\\n\r\nSeriously man its the only anime in which I actually liked all the songs and downloaded them with lyrics .. Upon Studying the lyrics both in japanese and English (Most songs were half in japanese and half in english mostly done by Myth and Roid (A new music group that made debut last year and became my favorites) I realized that it says about the themes , the thoughts , the concept etc..\\n\\n\r\n5.The Concept \\n\\n\r\n The concept is made of typical game type mechanisms .. Yes it is a fantasy based anime but It is purely game mechanics .. Subaru dies and come back to life - Checkpoints\\n\r\nReinhardt has buffs like - Arrows can never hit him , Never get ill And atleast 20 more .. -Abilities gained through leveling up\\n\r\nAnd sorry the rest are spoilers from the Novel so I wont say them..\\n\r\nI am a Gamer .. This is the best setting ever for me..\\n\\n\r\n6. Conclusion\\n\\n\r\n Re Zero is a Novel adaptation which is going to have 60 volumes and we are at Volume 10 .. Instead of giving us an empty meaningless ending they gave us some sort of conclusion and then told us to go buy the Novel .. It was actually pretty merciful of them because many anime end incomplete  , never even getting a 2nd season even with good amount of sales..\\n\\n\r\n7. My favourite genres\\n\\n\r\nPsychological , Action , Isekai Fantasy , Masterful Dialogues , I cant ask for anymore.. Thats why it went in my Top 3 ...\\n\\n\r\nThe things I Disliked :\\n\\n\r\nI disliked nothing except the fact that they ended the show and there is no news of a 2nd season..  This Anime was only 15 percent of total Re Zero Material.. For a show which hasnt even reached its climax , I have no other words or reasons for disliking it..\\n\\n",

            "content": "We can clearly see that the anime focuses more on the characters interaction, character development, showcasing post-traumatic stress disorder in our MC, themes of character flaws and realization of the reality, psychological stress, deception in motives of a person, distrust in one another, and exposition to the world that our MC resides in (talking about its system, beliefs, or existing group of individuals) - And well, that exposition part is probably one of the things that cause some to find this anime boring af. And I'm not going to lie. The fucking long ass episode 0 was not only shit and time consuming (because weall have already assumed that this setting is generic and we know exactly how it's going to prolly work), some of the early episodes are as well (excluding the anime's break from those intensities that Re-zero has to offers by showing a more calming, friendly, or even more reassuring scenes). This anime basically follow in the path of a slice of life kinda setting in an anime that have an adventurous setting that's not supposed to spend that much time on it. But why did I compare a slice of life anime to a horror, sad, savage, and fucking anime that based their story on dark fantasies? Because Re-zero spends more than 16 fucking episode for the MC to realises that his flaws and his selfish desires are delusional in the process of achieving his ideal goal (saving his white hair waifu, and em ladies). And that's why he's so easy to be manipulated by others, or even being treated as a kid, rather than a grown up, matured, and experienced person in life and in an environment filled with responsibility and duty. And this anime has really portrayed it really well unlike many shows that I have personally seen. And that's like 100+ of them. \\n\\n\r\nAnd what do those kinds of slice of life anime have in common to this one? Yes, they spend most of their earliest episode, throughout half of the series on character development, representing each of the character's flaws, building up a relationship and so forth. That's the author's way of writing his stories, and it's pretty innovative when he applies it to a dark generic story about a weak hero trying to protect someone. But some may not like this kind of writing style if you're one of those people who overvalue one's beliefs over another. When you know exactly that these ideas are never to be confused with an apodictic truth, or an absolute one. But hey, the anime did pick it up its intensities after those expositions have been over with, and when Subaru finally made it into the mansion. And some may be mentioned that the setting of doing everything all over again from the start, because of some random death is a pretty lame ass facet to stagnate the plot line, and the story progression. But have you ever heard of an anime that's trying to input the realism of this scenario in any anime other than Stein;gate? Well, they're different anime, Stein;gate has to deals with paradoxes and cheating universal laws to repeat the MC's horrible mistakes and to the very end in a temporary good end before the near dark future.\\n\\n\r\nBut Re:zero's application was more of a video game, rather than actually dealing with those paradoxical shit. So it may seem similar to any of those time travel anime. But for this case, Re:zero have absolutely nothing to do with any of that shit. Since checkpoints in this anime are more video game logic depended, than it's following a time travel logic of space and time. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now some may question, \"does the conversation that Subaru have with anyone in this story pointless?\" Most of their dialogue is consists of Subaru trying to gain trust from the maids (by having a conversation or spending time together), being lecture by experienced people about the responsibility (Crusch and all of the other ones) and the hard work that's required to mature, or to know exactly what's it that you desire for sure (in this case, I wanna kill someone because I hate them, so I will use an excuse of wanting to protect someone just to get that achieved). I personally never sees their conversation as  being\"pointless\" when this anime is nothing like one of those typical slices of life anime. And I personally feel strongly that the idea of debasing an anime by calling it out as being \"cliche\" is one heck of an ignorant thing to say. All Hollywood movies I have seen follow the same cliche, and typical plot structure, setting, themes, and even the fucking characters (like that 1 dude that fight against 1000 dudes with a machine gun and rekt em all somehow). Including any other animes out there. \\n\\n\r\nBut all of that aside, I'll have to admit that I was not really a big fan of this anime while watching the beginning of the episodes. But for some reason, I was able to watch it through because of the unique characters that some may call them as \"bland\" when they're fucking weird as fuck with their attires, personality, voice acting and shit lmao. I don't even know what's your definition of bland anymore if you asserted that these kinds of anime character in this show is in fact is. \\n\\n\r\nTake for instances, Emilia, the girl who will put you in her friendzone even if you're trying to imply that you love her with a very clear indication of it, wanting to spend time with her by wanting to go on a date, or even trying to flatter her with all your might. Rem and Ram, the two maids within this fantasy world that I haven't seen at all I any anime that have those kinds of maid like characters in any fantasies anime. There may be, but it's not as typical for a fantasy RPG like setting to have. And I could go on and on here. But you get my point.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime isn't bad at all. I personally fall in love with a lot of characters within the show (aside from fucking SUBARU OF FUCKING COURSE). And the reasons for those pretentious, sounding characters to sound so fucking pretentious to you is because you haven't actually acknowledged that person, or that character, or possibly anyone without the proper status for you to take them seriously. And that's normal. But most of that pretentious behavior from em support characters are meant to say shit to make Subaru realises his flaws, his misconception of selfish desires over protecting someone, being a sore loser like the attitude that should be fixed. And Subaru is dense and deluded as fuck too. So it took him like 16 episodes for that to get him to turn into a mentally strong MC, that's powerless. While isn't all that strange because I have met someone like that in real life before. Even on the fucking internet lmao. \\n\\n\r\nAll of that aside, Subaru is more of a general, tactician, or leader; rather than your typical super powerful, friendship like power kinda MC that protects and out power everyone in the show. But really, this anime is pretty good later on after a couple of boring episodes explaining the setting, MC falling in love with the heavenly beautiful dream elf girl, character interactions (which is still kinda fun to see) and so forth. But this anime is fucking entertaining man. And they show didn't use violence for the sake of violence btw. It's just to show that death is a terrifying thing, and that's why our MC will not kill himself off just to redo every single mistake that he makes. just to show some realism into the show itself. Or just to make our MC to finally give in to the realisation that he's weak af, and he should fucking embrace it like a man and grow the fuck up. But nonetheless, the artwork looks pretty cool, detailed, and em background art is amazing. The voice acting is pretty awesome as well (well it's their occupation lmao). But anyway, check it out before assuming that it's shit. It's not a masterpiece, but still a pretty great, and innovative in the writing of the show.\\n\\n\r\nP.S (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA-ijHB9LNc) This is the author himself, who give \"Son Wukong\" An anime live reactor a notice and a gift to him, and that would be all the Re:zero novel up to the current release, shirts, posters wtih everything autographed lmao.This was after a twitter DMs, and he even shares this \"Son Wukong\" live reaction of his anime to his twitter because he \"enjoys it\". Even the animation staff and watannabe director of Re:zero even watch it too lmao. Tappei Nagatsuki is the fucking man lmao",

            "content": "Re:Zero is not for the faint-hearted. This is a warning. The show is incredible, one of the best I have come across. But it is deceptively grim and dark. Despair is not a foreign concept here. Re zero seemingly promised a light-hearted adventure anime that bore a striking resemblance to Konosuba but then it did something I have never seen an anime do before. It took firm hold of my heartstrings and yanked them in opposite directions. It effectively ripped apart my expectations, and my heart along with them.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story starts off with a similar note to Konosuba, a NEET that gets thrown into amedieval-based RPG world. His expectations of grandeur and power belonging to the typical protagonist gets dashed and by chance, he finds a companion. Then the time travel aspect gets introduced and the story starts to spiral down into the darkness. Yes, a major point of the show is that Subaru can die and can return to a certain point in time, sort of like a save point. This travel premise allows Subaru to try over and over again if he fails and this might seem like a ridiculously great advantage. It isn\u2019t as great as it seems. The ordeals that Subaru goes through are shockingly dark. Depressingly dark. We get to see Subaru fight and struggle over and over again until your heart breaks for the poor guy. There were times that I had wondered why Subaru didn\u2019t just break down right there and then. When Subaru finally triumphs over the depressing dead ends, there is the feeling of relief and satisfaction. The hero finally gets what he deserves. And then suddenly, you realized that you are emotionally attached to the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nRe zero has an interesting cast with their own engaging back stories and character. But to avoid spoilers, I will just be focusing on the mc. \\n\r\nSubaru is one of the most realistic characters I have ever seen. Just like in reality, this character has his strengths as well as his weaknesses, successes as well as failures. And his flaws are portrayed exceptionally well. You can admire that kindness, determination and courage in him. But the show also ensures awareness of the stubbornness, arrogance and neediness in him. We get to see the ugly side of Subaru, his desperate need to feel needed, that undeserved pride and an irritating sense of pettiness among other things. His cringe-worthy flaws disgusted me at times but I stuck around. It was worth it. This character is worth the watch. He fights, gets the world pulled from under his feet and then he struggles again, all the time harboring thoughts and emotions that were relatable to, especially the negative ones. Subaru isn\u2019t a perfect character and neither is he a strong one, but his life-like human qualities make him a character that you will remember whether you like him or not.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound:\\n\r\nThe animation is worthy of a 2016 anime and is aesthetically pleasing. But the soundtrack is the more noteworthy aspect of the show. The thing that I noticed was that it was extremely suitable. At the times when you were supposed to feel the character's joy or dejection, the soundtrack created the perfect atmosphere for that particular emotion. With impressive visuals, background music that is pleasing to the ears and a complementing atmosphere, what is not to like?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the experience, even if it wasn\u2019t exactly a pleasant one throughout. It is an emotional rollercoaster and should be taken as such. The story takes the characters that you feel for then wrenches your heart as they suffer horribly. But it also takes the characters that you feel for and gives them their happiest moments as you watch with satisfaction from afar. It has highs and lows. Extreme ones. That is what makes the ride engaging and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nRe zero has definitely earned a place on my favorites list, the list of anime that I will never forget amongst the easily forgettable sea of generic shows. If you are looking for a masterpiece of a ride then congratulations, you have found one. But it isn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows, despair and gore come along as a package. If you can get around that point, then you have found yourself a rare gem. To be honest, the show was something like a guilty pleasure for me. I had told myself to exercise a bit of discipline and wait for the entire series to be out before watching. But I couldn\u2019t deny my curiosity and binged watched an entire 22 episodes in a day. That is just how captivating and alluring the series is. Don\u2019t just take my word for it, give it a shot. (At least until episode 15. By that point, you\u2019d probably get a gist of what the show is like.) I hope that watching Re zero will be as great an experience for you as it was for me. I was knocked off my feet.",

            "content": "Welcome to my Re:Zero review, I will try to go over as many things as possible as I can in this review, I must warn you that this\r\nreview MIGHT contain spoilers, I won't include any major spoilers BUT I will talk about characters for example that don't appear\r\nep 1!\r\nSo when I started Re:Zero I was amazed, I loved this anime from first sight, it ticked all the boxes now let me first talk about\r\nthe main character: subaru\r\nNow one thing I have to point out is that when you start watching you may at first call this a Harem garbage anime, I don't think\r\nso (more onthat later)\\n\\n\r\nABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTER!\\n\r\nSubaru is the protagonist of Re:Zero, he is usually the weakest and is bad at doing anything, but he has a strong will and is\\n\r\nready to give everything he has for the ones he cares about... He will try again and again... Subaru really had lots of \\n\r\ndevelopment through the series, usually there is zero progression in any anime but this anime really managed to develop not only\\n\r\nthe main character... ok so many might say \"oh subaru is so annoying\", but I guess that is personal taste, I think he is\\n\r\nsomething diffrent from your usual protagonist but you might not think so... I do have to say he does some stupid stuff and\\n\r\nyou will probably sit there and think \"why the fu** did he just do that?\" But he fixes everything in the end and his stupid\\n\r\nstuff wasn't actually that stupid...\\n\\n\r\nIS IT HAREM?\\n\r\nnow I know many people say that this anime is just a harem THAT IS NOT TRUE(!) while yes, almost EVERY 2. Main Character is\\n\r\nfemale this anime IS NOT harem, almost all females have ZERO intrest in him and rather hate him... So NO harem here! also the\\n\r\nanime drifts to only subaru after a while so he has his stuff going on but no harem, sorry\\n\\n\r\nIS IT JUST TIME RESET CRA*?\\n\r\nNO it is not! While there are a lot of time resets these ALL have part in the story! They also have a giant impact in Subarus\\n\r\nactions and overall personality! Also it doesn't get reptitive, they really did a good job making sure it always stayed\\n\r\ninteresting!\\n\\n\r\nHOW CONFUSING IS THE STORY?\\n\r\nNow the story is kinda confusing, after some time you might wonder what timeline we are in now and what had actually happend,\\n\r\nbut not necessarialy, they did a good job making sure you can follow the story and keep in mind what had happend in that timeline\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nIS IT FUN?\\n\r\nYes\\n\\n\r\nIS IT CONFUSING? (IS IT TO FAST/SLOW?)\\n\r\nNot really, it manages to get a nice pasing so it doesn't get to fast or to slow and it doesn't get to slow!\\n\\n\r\nSHOULD YOU WATCH IT?\\n\r\nYes definitly!\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThe story is very well though, actions have consequences and it was very well though out!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation is very good with a very nice artstyle\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound is a VERY crucial part of this anime, dramatic music, no sound as times of fear and very good voice actors!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe Characters are a very crucial part of this anime, everyone from the apple seller to the main protagonist have unique\\n\r\npersonality's! The Characters develop during the series and all have a very nice design! They also all serve another purpose\\n\r\nthen \"here is a characters he is just here to fill up space\"...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime A LOT, I must say that it is my probably favorite anime of 2016, maybe even of all time\\n\r\nand that says A LOT! Make sure to definitly watch it, its up on crunchroll (support the creators!)\\n\\n\r\n-Laurin\\n\r\nHope you liked my review... :I\\n\\n\r\nbtw the ending was good",

            "content": "What if you were useless? Oh wait, you are. (No spoilers/very minor overall look of the anime)\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story begins with Subaru (yes, a car), who has a NEET life. He is magically transported to a different world, and this is when the adventure begins. Since Subaru is a regular man in a fantasy world, he has no power but the persuasion of his speech to get him out of situations. Later on, he does acquire powerful assets to help him in his journey. The 1st arc of the story is heavily character developed for the cast, and the 2nd arc is Subaru's quest toget his life under control, and how he himself develops as a character.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThere were some magical scenes that moved me. I didn't feel this feeling since Clannad or Plastic Memories. Other than the magical scenes, the art is really well done, as it is detailed and enough art is presented each episode, so we don't see a million things on screen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nRe:Zero potentially has the best music in anime ever. The opening gets you hyped, and at the end of the episodes the ending just makes you feel connected to Subaru. The insert songs that they played also just fit right in the episodes. They chose the perfect timing for the minute they start the song. This is the highest 10 I would give out of the others, because the sound fits the show no matter what situation it is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nYou meet plenty of characters, some are shown for a bit then ignored for a while as well. The main focus of the show is Subaru's personality, and how his perspective on life changes every episode. We also see 2 other characters develop their personality in detail as well, as they express their feelings and ideas to the audience's perspective.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI began watching this show when episode 18 came out. I picked the right time to start watching this, as I couldn't wait for every Sunday after that. I was hyped as the opening plays, and anxious when the ending played. This show is a must binge watch. There is no way you can take this show slowly, as it grabs your attention with every episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nRe:Zero is my Anime of the Year for 2016, as it had truly the best sound, and made me hyped for this show since episode 18. Here is to hope for season 2!",

            "content": "Warning : This review contains spoilers.\r\nRe:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu is for me the most original anime that I've ever seen. \r\nThe story tells about Natsuki Subaru who goes out from a supermarket and suddenly he appears in a different world (Isekai). In this world, there is no technology, nevertheless there is magic, knights, witches, and lots of creatures. Subaru will meet Emilia a silver-haired half-elf girl and he will fall in love with her. But in this world it's easy to die. And somehow, Subaru has the power of return to death or more precisely make the world travelling through time in the pastbefore his death at a certain checkpoint. This power may be given by the Jealous Witch, the Witch who almost destroyed this world 400 years ago, this power will be very useful because Subaru will die over 15 times.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing in particular to say about art, except that was very well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, was just INCREADIBLE, I really loved the openings and endings too, I can lisen to these openings evrey day without get bored, Redo and Paradisus-Paradoxum were very poignant and they were correspond to each part of this anime (I'm talking only about the sound).\\n\\n\r\nEach character in Re:Zero were really well done and for each character we know who they is, deeply. Natsuki Subearu the main character is very very weak, he has absolutely no strenght inside him but he has a mental power unbelivable, he never abandons and always did his best, despite of his weakness. Emilia is the second main character, she is very beautiful nice and helpful but because of her appearence (she looks like the Jealous Witch) lot of people hate her, she is living in Roswaal's mansion. Roswaal we don't know a lot about him but he is a powerful wizard who controls the magic of six elements and he seems to be interested by Ram (not in love, I think). Ram and Rem are maids working in Roswaal's mansion, they are devils but as they are twins they only have one horn, Ram is a pink-haired girl who is sometimes mean with Subaru but she can be nice and funny sometimes, she manipulate wind magic. Ram is my favourite character, she is blue-haired and an she has a bigger chest than her sister, she is kind, caring and she is ready for anything while it's for Subaru because she is in love with Subaru. \\n\\n\r\nEvery sunday were the most anticipated day, I prepared pop-corns, chocolates, drinks etc... for watching Re:Zero because each episode was very poignant and I enjoyed every episodes until the last one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was certainly the best anime I've ever seen, thanks to it's originality. I reeeeaaaaaaly recommand Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu (Re:Life in a different world from zero). \\n\\n",

It's just this fantasy of an ordinary dude getting sucked into another dimension full of adventure then you throw in a bit of the movie groundhog day in there (and *potential spoilers* here for anyone whose not heard of the premise) he jumps back in time which is only activated by him dying.... Most of the instances in which this happens are soooooo messed up it'stoo intriguing to stop watching. The connections he makes with the supporting characters are so deep and heartfelt. I recommend to anyone who may be on the fence about watching it to just give it a try. It's definitely worth a watch.",

Don't let that just automatically tell you to not watch it. The main protagonist is named Subaru Natsuki who seems to another one of those Hikikomori tracksuit wearing characters at first. But he isn't gonna like have to kill a Demon King tosave that world or something like that. He gets saved by a half-human, half-elf girl who whom he starts to develop feelings for, which grows stronger throughout the series. After getting killed a couple times & redoing a some stuff over, he realizes he has a power inside of him that can allow him to revive to a certain checkpoint if he ever dies. From then on, he starts going into problems that result in him dying and reviving until he finds a solution to it. During these revivals(or \"respawns\"), he experiences tragedies of people he befriended/encountered over and over again in this world. His checkpoint would be overwrited at times when he successfully bypasses a level(the conflict he is facing gets resolved). During these respawns , we see somewhat development in his character through his time in this fantasy world(Note: we know nothing of his life before this world), we meet more characters and get to know most of them better as the story progresses maybe seeing background stories for some as a treat too. I loved most of the actions that Subaru did most of the time, and how conflicts were resolved by him. Overall I loved every character in this and shipped Subaru & Rem this whole series despite the ending being not what I hoped for, I still enjoyed this series and hope other otakus will enjoy this series as much as I did.",

            "content": "An absolute cringe fest at best. There is no better comment to describe this show. \r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nWhat was originally perceived to be a generic time kill ended up being indubitably one of the best anime of the several ongoing seasons. The very initial premise of the show may be considered cliche as the thought of the primary character being sucked into a figurative virtual world is a reoccurring theme in anime nowadays. In hindsight, the very thought of this schematic is humorous, for it makes the honey taste that much sweeter for what plot Re:Zero's story has to offer.\r\n| Story: 9 |\r\nThe original story writer exploresthe many levels of depths of the human psyche and invigorates what it really is like to descend to the levels of madness. The author stimulates new levels of emotions and feelings you'll hardly find in any medium. As the main character, Natsuki Subaru, struggles in what would be mind boggling despair, you will never cringe as hard as seeing the primary character squirm from the horrifying and endlessly repeating doom that awaits him. What starts off as a light story, spirals downwards at the perfect pace to what would eventually be absolute despair that would leave even the creators of Danganronpa impressed. The story begins with the main character trapped in a fantasy world, then chasing tail after a beautiful maiden, until he realizes that he's stuck with a curse that resurrects him from death just to repeat whatever tragedy lies for him. This gear sets the story in motion, and for what would change the main character into an absolute mess.\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Art: 9 |\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of Re:Zero is refreshing and vibrant that sets the tone for the magical city where the story unfolds. Filled with livelihood and a vibrant color palette, it suits the persona of the show's intentions quite well. What's even more impressive, is how the art style can retain such sinister detail for when the story takes a vicious turn. The details that went into the character expressions, especially the development of Natsuki Subaru is beyond impressive, and captures a revolting-but-compelling image of the character, perfectly suits his image. The overall art quality is also impressive and up to standards with modern day animation.\\n\\n\r\n| Sound: 9 |\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects for Re:Zero are so perfectly captured that you'll hardly notice how comparable it is with reality. This may be an exaggeration, but it's well done to the point whereas you won't even notice them. Especially with the gore and overall messiness that may unravel, the sound effects capture the gross and horrifying nature of the show. What would be especially important to remark is the quality of the voice actors, whom seem to almost perfectly represent the characters to such precision. The best illustration of this would be the voice over for Subaru, whom the voice actor really seems to capture that detestable, cringe-like emotions that Natsuki portrays later on in the story. It's what really makes the anime this much compelling. Both openings and endings are also quite catchy, if you're into intro music.\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Character: 10 |\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is not something that would hit you out of nowhere so suddenly, but is rather a series of changes that you may just progressively accept for what becomes of the characters. The principal characters change over a period of time at what would be considered a perfect pace that would not be too rushed, but relatively natural. As the story progresses, Subaru loses face as his character deteriorates after struggling in his conflicts, but ultimately constantly being able to do nothing of value in the end. It's not a feeling of pity or sadness that might develop in heed of the main character, but a feeling of disgust and unbearable repulsion for how he tackles his situation and loses all faith against the impossible odds. The transition from a provocative but endearing character to an individual of perpetual gloom whom becomes blind to his own senses, I must say, strikes at a remarkable degree of accuracy. It perfectly envisions how man's actions becomes shrouded by angst and how the actions you take changes the impression you have on everyone else. What would be hard to put into words is considered as perfection.\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Enjoyment: 10 |\\n\\n\\n\r\nWalking into Re:Zero without any specific expectations results in a surprisingly pleasant impression. How the very developments unfold and the infamous cliffhangers proceed actually makes each and every episode redeeming. Each nightmare the main character faces and shapes his character will constantly keep you intrigued. The characters' unsavory reactions and expressions and the very deceit of the show makes it so much more entertaining. Ultimately, Re:Zero is a wolf in sheep's clothing that reveals the concept of man's plunge towards dreadfulness when presented to horror, and the decisions revolving around the desperate actions that man will then take. The image is presented in such a clever manner, that one may not help but to enjoy the show for what it is. Completely unexpected, and yet, it becomes all the more conventional.\\n\\n",

I've gotten so excited that I've started to sweat, even in a cool room. I've cried tears of joy, and tears of sadness.\r\nThe story starts out right in the middle of the first chapter, with the \"beginning\" being explained through flashbacks. This approach lets us feel how overwhelmed and confused Subaru (The MC) is a lot of the time. \r\nThe many characters encountered throughout the series invoke strong emotions in me. Their personalities are slowlyexpanded, with their feelings, and reasons for their actions revealed over time, making them very deep, developed characters, that I really grew to care for. From the protagonist, to the friends around him, even the Villian(s), there is depth to them; Many anime suffer from flat characters, who are little more than their stereotype. While many characters can be put into various roles often seen in anime, they are not limited to those roles. They fill them up, with their own sense of self, and really come alive. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, this story is not for the faint of heart. Things get gruesome, and Subaru has to struggle with a great many, horrible things weighing down his heart. But he struggles on, and perseveres, with the emotional support of the characters around him. He's not strong, or fast, or particularity smart, but he is driven, and determined; I end up feeling for him, and rooting for him. Clenching my fists, wanting him to succeed, against all the odds that seem stacked against him.\\n\\n\r\nAfter I finished this anime, I'm left with the downside of watching something so spectacular. I want more content of this calibre, and it will be a long time before I can find something that is so satisfying to watch, as this was.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu, \" Starting Life in Another World From Zero\", is one of my all time favorites, a list I can count on one hand.\\n",

The plot and story line was great. Each character had a past and it touched on all of them. The mc's inner conflicts were great and it really mad you think. It went very deep and leaves you wanting more. It was overall just great the only flaw I would say is that they kinda forced the whole \"my hero\" idea because if you think of it Emlia is stronger than Subarubut that was fine with me. But what I loved the most was the artwork, it was outstanding and I loved it!!! (Except I wish he would change and stop wearing that track suit .3.) The only reason why someone might hate it is because of how forceful and stubborn the mc is but that is what he is supposed to be.",

This is my first review and it may be biased as I have not watched many shows to compare this one to. \r\nNevertheless, I must say Re:Zero has been absolutely amazing. The story was absolutely fantastic, and the concept of returning from death has been an idea that I've been waiting to see come to life in a show or movie. Re:Zero definitely exceeded my expectations by creating an immersive world that I wished I was a part of in a way. Theway the plot developed and transitioned, moving from each story arc was seamless and easily allowed a continuation of the plot without any disconnections.  Every story arc in the show was fantastic and captivating, forcing me to watch more. However, I feel as if more details need be added to the stories in order for viewers to truly understand what is going on. The characters were fantastic too, each will high levels of character development that really makes you feel like you know them in real life. The art, the music, the openings, and the endings have all added to the exhilarating ride of the show. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero has been a long and emotional ride, truly an unforgettable experience that will definitely call me back to re watch the series at a later date. Now that the show is over, I feel lost in a way, an emotion that only the best and most immersive anime or TV shows will bring out of me.  Without a doubt, I highly recommend everybody watch Re:Zero! \\n\\n",

            "content": "So, I've noticed the many hateful reviews given to this anime. Despite its magnificence, many are hating on it. Some of these reviews seem to be written just for likes, and others just for trolling. I will attempt to make this review something that will truly evaluate this animated story of Re:Zero.\r\nWARNING- may contain minor spoilers\r\nStory- 10\r\nThe story is very simple: The protagonist wants to save people from death. In doing so, he dies, but reincarnates himself upon failure. So, what is it that makes this memorable? Answering that would be a spoiler, but the best way to describe it is failure. Everyone experiences failure.You, me, the guy down the street, and especially Subaru. he gets a failure stamp on his back as he continues to struggle, to fail, to try, and to destroy himself over and over and over again. In doing so, he kills himself, no longer being motivated by saving, but by desperation. He displays the average human among the beasts, magicians, and demons in his world. It also shows what would truly happen to a human in a different world. Many anime play this off by giving the protagonist a powerful sidekick, a \"special power\", a weapon, or luck(looking at you Konosuba.) The anime gives the protagonist ABSOLUTELY nothing. That is, if you forget the reincarnation. Even then, reincarnation doesn't help his survivability, it just gives you another chance, like a video game. When you lose in a video game, it doesn't give you cheat codes, or weapons, or the power of friendship. It just gives you the option to retry. But, when ignoring reincarnation, it gives nothing, takes everything, and kills your dreams of living in a parallel world in a realistic way.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound- 9\\n\\n\r\nThese to are mainly put together because they shouldn't be the main focus of anime. The main focus should be the story. Art and sound should only be there to support, not to be a major category. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the art and sound are great. The openings and endings fit perfectly to the anime's theme, and the soundtrack also fits well. the artwork had a few flaws, such as some parts being in 3D instead of being animated. HOWEVER, that happens once every 10 episodes. It's a flaw, but an extremely small one. In conclusion, the art and sound both fit the anime like sidekicks fit to main characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all work well with the story. Subaru, the main character, almost displays a human perfectly. He has flaws, goes for girls, occasionally acts weird, and has flaws. Did I mention he has flaws. Well, he has flaws. Subaru isn't perfect, which is very refreshing when watching other anime. Most of the time, protagonists are special, where either their physicality, combat ability, perception, or anything else is top notch. Almost all anime protagonists have a top-notch skill or ability. Not Subaru. He isn't special, and could be replaced by many other males from earth. He might be strong, but punches don't work on magic. He may be enthusiastic, but enthusiasm doesn't help him. He may be the protagonist, but that doesn't mean he gets special attention. He's normal. He's average. That's what makes him special.\\n\\n\r\nEmilia was created out of an ideal. She was created out of other waifus to be the ultimate waifu. She's nice, strong(but not too strong) and perfect. Everyone would love her as a girlfriend. Despite this, everyone hats her because of her resemblance to someone else. That shows realism, because most anime have a completely perfect character. This anime shows that perfection could be the cause of imperfection.\\n\\n\r\nRem should not be listed as a side character. Although she is the ultimate support character, she has almost as many, if not more lines than Emilia, and should've been the main girl in many people's perspective. Rem is also strong, nice, and beautiful, but is stuck as a maid, caring for and looking after the other characters. Yet another case of amazingness lessened because of something realistic. Missed opportunity. Or, opportunities never given to her. Another case of realistic tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nAll other characters are basic supports. Rem's sister, Ram, Puck, the apple man, felt, Julis, Feliz, the other crown contendors, and the list goes on and on. they all have something in them that's memorable. I am really bad with names, yet I doubt I will forget anyone here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  10\\n\\n\r\nI don't have to explain myself. This review does it for me. Re:Zero is incredible, and you should watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Just watch it\\n\\n\r\nJust watch it.\\n",

            "content": "DONT LISTEN TO THE NAYSAYERS \r\nOk to start off ReZero is one of the best anime I have ever seen; I will be the first to admit that there were moments when I cringed in the anime. Namely around the 15-16 episode mark. Dont listen to any reviewers that have NOT completed the anime. This anime is a roller coaster so you cant judge it on the individual parts, but the story overall. Ok now that my rant is over lets move on. \r\nStory: \r\nReZero's story may sound like the typical otaku Neet character being tossed into a fantasy world full of sexy elves andscary looking demons; but be warned this is certainly not the case. This anime is not light hearted and full of comedy, although thankfully some parts include both of the former. It reminded me of the darkness in psycho-pass if thats any inclination to you how dark the story is. It starts out with the MC dying a few times in unbeliveablely  dark and epic ways, and the MC is forced to learn from his past mistakes to get to the right outcome; however most of this time like most lovable main characters he disregards this entirely. The story includes many great side characters and character development which I will explain later on. Overall the plot revolves around the witch satela that just happens to be the MC's main love intrests supposed doppleganger. This earns her alot of resentment even though the witch has not been seen in centurys; so you can probably guess she must have been quite the bad ass villan: anyway Im trying not to spoil the story for you so moving on. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe Art of this anime is absolutly amazing, especially the buildings, landscape, and characters. The studio who animated this was whitefox the animaters of steins gate, so think that level of animation in a fantasy realm. Really all you need to do is watch one episode and you will figure it out for yourself. The fights are amazingly choriographed -sorry for misspelling (it happens), and overall the animation is verry fluid. The only reason I gave art a 9 instead of a 10 was because I think the magic could have been a little better; but thats my most watched type of anime so Im a bit of a harsh critic in that area. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\ni judge sound in anime at a pretty high standard think seraph of the end if you have seen it(if you havent WATCH IT). The opening and ending songs -4 total are all amazing and the soundtrack is magnificiant, in dark moments and at the end of an episode clifhanger it will send a chill down your spine. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNow alot of people hate on the MC in this anime and thats mostly because he isnt some OP god level mythical unicorn type motherf#$@@#. And in two episodes he has some real cringe worthy moments. However never in any anime have I seen a character developed as well as this one. He begins the story a dumb otaku who doesnt even understand his own world let alone the new one he's been dropped in\\n\r\nBut after many deaths he learns from his mistakes and grows from them (sometimes in a negative way) The emotions he feels and the actions he takes are the same a real living person would. And overall I think he is probably the most relatable character an anime could make. The side characters are all amazing and have little things you learn about them, not so much backstory in the not so close to the mc characters but more about their personality and why they make the decisions they do. The characters close to the MC are given great backstories and you can really feel for them. Overall an amazing job by the writer. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall\\n\r\nThis is probably my favorite anime of all time, and thats coming from someone who has seen over 150 days worth of anime ( no i dont have the time to add them all to my list) Everything about it is well done, and it is definantly unique. \\n\\n\r\nSo finally my advice to you, this anime should be in the top 5 on myanimelist, and the only reason it is not is the people who rate and review it before finishing it. \\n\r\nSo judge for yourself how good it is and WATCH IT!!!\\n",

            "content": "Every now and then, we, the anime community, are blessed with a gem.  A gem, shining ever so brightly in the sea of mediocrity that are the seasonal anime manages to blind the majority of the community with its seemingly endless blister into thinking that the title at hand is somehow special and praiseworthy. After a rather short period of time, the bright light the  gem once used to vividly emulate begins to flicker, until eventually fading away into eternal darkness and being forgotten. It's nothing new; rather just a byproduct of hype culture and the negative effect it has on entertainment media.The implementation of various anime databases and platforms like MAL in recent years make the anime medium in particular all the more susceptible to this horrible disease that seemingly spreads like wildfire. And for that reason, I will gladly presume the role of a firefighter. This one'll go in-depth.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from a rather lacklustre source material, the story revolves around our protagonist, Subaru. When Subaru one day decides to venture out into the wilderness that is the grocery store next door, he is out of nowhere magically transported into an unfamiliar fantasy world. Why / how / who / what was it that teleported him there? He doesn't know. We don't know. No one knows. Literally 2 minutes into the show we are presented with a plot device that sets the entire anime into motion. While definitely a negative, I don't particularly mind too much as it is a problem on a far lesser scale than in say Erased, where the plot device is something integral to the narrative. The rest of the plot is fairly straight-forward. In essence, the main character explores the setting, goes through various scenarios, meets a shit load of cute girls while going through individual arcs, etc. So obviously, it possesses all of the shitty traits that plague each and every light novel in existence, and if there was one thing that all of the people who share my general consensus on the show agree on, it would be on how generic it is. \\n\\n\r\nAs if to counteract its' generic nature, the story constantly puts in a conscious effort to be as unpredictable as possible. It serves as a mostly-consistent source of entertainment and I truly do commend the author for that one. But.. where exactly is the line drawn? While plot twists can do wonders in the heat of the moment, Re:Zero tends to gradually overdose on them, often resulting in a faint sense of redundancy. No series is supposed to be this reliant on shock factor to keep the audience seated but apparently going in with the mentality that each respectful viewer suffers from extreme ADHD is the only way to make it big nowadays. The \"dark\" in the \"dark fantasy\" is emphasized on quite a lot, if not a little too much later on. This seems to be what most fans consider to be the driving force of the show, ultimately setting it apart from the typical light novel adaptation. However, a wise man once said \"A different approach does not guarantee a quality outcome\". The wise man in question happens to be your humble writer, of course.\\n\\n\r\nVarious anime in the past have thrived off of their dark element, but it is extremely important that you, as a viewer, are able to differentiate between shows that are completely reliant on constant edge and shows that are able to stand on their own two feet without it. I'm not implying that Re:Zero is completely reliant on its edge.. But yeah, I am. While most of the community seems to find it intensely gripping for some odd reason or another, I found most of the \"dark\" scenes to be outright laughable. This is not because I'm some kind of despicable shounen antagonist who has a preconcieved notion against the very fundamentals of fun, but rather the execution of said scenes being far too comical for their own good. Once in a blue moon I really was able to get invested in some of the grimdark stuff, but for the overwhelming majority it was just me laughing my ass off at the sight of villains that resembled an inflatable tube man outside a used car lot that would wiggle their arms and body around while being EVILLL. \\n\\n\r\nSomething that constantly kept pissing me off is how the anime goes about presenting itself. The rough transitioning between dark and goofy makes it extremely hard to ever get fully immersed into the story as it is both completely off-putting and can easily ruin the mood that was in place just a minute ago. I know not every show can have the godsend that is Puck (the elf, not the furby) to ease things out in dire times but really, they could have tried a bit harder. You've got instances where one second the protagonist is casually talking with someone and not even a full minute afterwards he is frantically running for his life. Or even better, while participating in a deathmatch against one of the deadliest assassins in the land, the characters randomly start throwing jokes and snarky remarks at each other like their current life or death situation is a family picnic. It should be obvious to virtually anyone how something that feels so out of place singlehandedly ruins the tension and intense atmosphere that the show was trying to build up just a mere second ago.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, I'd like to cover what I consider to easily be the biggest problem of Re:Zero. While I could hardly fault a show for having crazy powers in a setting that is entirely reliant on the supernatural, time resets are one of the absolute worst writing tricks in history. \"Return by Death\", ignoring the lack of creativity within the name itself, is by no means an exception - Granting Subaru the ability to go back in time whenever he is killed AKA basically giving him a free checkpoint, returning him to the moment that suits him the most before the time of his death. In Re:Zero, it feels like this trick is implemented whenever the writer comes to the realization that the story is incredibly reliant and dry without it, and so time is reset. It's not a bad thing to spice things up every once in a while but chances are that it's either going to be Subaru constantly going back in time before everything was fucked and starting all over again from step 1 or have the said conflict be resolved by sleazy plot conveniences. \"Oh Roswaal-sama, I didn't see you there! How mighty convenient it is that you have arrived at just the perfect time to evaporate the gigantic demon-dog from the underworld that was about to devour my flesh in the span of two seconds!\" It kinda makes you wonder if the concept of good writing is really such a mysterious term to the people who write light novels.\\n\\n\r\nReturn by Death also works as a double-edged sword in the case of Re:Zero. I am taking into consideration the fact that when executed properly, it allows for a fair number of interesting scenarios to play out throughout the series which is something that shouldn't be dismissed. Putting that aside, it is almost guaranteed that the implementation of time resets will deal a heavy blow to any cast of characters that are unaffected by this phenomenon. By having the protagonist and the protagonist only be able to utilize this ability renders the development of the rest of the cast completely null and void, seeing as he will be the only person to retain his memories from the previous iterations. It sacrifices the very fundamentals of characterization while completely throwing the concept of development out of the window for anyone besides him and is the sole reason that stories which rely on time resets have difficulty reaching critical acclaim. I can literally think of a single instance in anime in which time resets are utilized successfully but I don't see Yuasa Masaaki's name under the staff section.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, it brings up several plot threads for a brief period of time before lightly shrugging them under the rug whenever it so pleases, as if they had never existed. While not inherently plotholes, they almost feel like inconsistencies within the overarching narrative and I'm not sure if they are ever explained in the novel, but briefly covering them in the anime and never touching upon them ever again is completely pointless and a waste of time. Stuff like: Does Return by Death have the ability to take effect on others around Subaru or did Emilia just suffocate to death from the peer pressure of his hug? There are also huge inconsitincies within the world's functions, which have no backbone to sit on as the theory behind them is completely amiss. Stuff like: What was it that triggered Subaru's transportation? Will we ever be given proper information on Return by Death? - \"But is explained in da light novEL! ! !\" is not a valid argument, sorry. It's also worth noting how inconsistent the story is in terms of quality between its individual arcs, namely with the final act of the series being utterly ludicrous in the worst way possible.\\n\\n\r\nThrough a long and careful process of deduction, I have come to the conclusion that to be a character of Re:Zero, you must poses at least one of the three mandatory traits. The traits in question are as follows:\\n\\n\r\nBe able to appeal to the otaku audience in one way or another \u2714\\n\r\nBe an easy to hate, psychopathic piece of shit \u2714\\n\r\nLean towards borderline insanity \u2714\\n\\n\r\nThis lot can be applied to absolutely any character in the series, from Subaru to Puck with few and far in between. And what better way to start this section off than with the man who encompasses all three? \\n\\n\r\nSubaru is the very definition of a hit or miss main character. It\u2019s not hard to decipher that at his very core, he is a self-insert who was brought into existence solely as a means of identification with your average basement-dweller, which is hardly surprising considering that this is a light novel adaptation. But while he does seem to inherit the \u201cNihilistic shut-in protagonist who\u2019s actually a really nice guy on the inside\u201d trait, he surprisingly has a few quirks of his own. In my eyes, he started off as the most hateable cunt in the known universe (Orange still hadn\u2019t aired at this point) but as the series progressed, I was to my bewilderment able to actually empathize with his character. With that in mind, it still took all I had in order to watch most of his normal interactions with the rest of the cast when he was in his right mind so it really was a breath of fresh air when he went absolutely bonkers and stopped talking altogether. Of course this only lasted for a single episode because as we know, anime protagonists are immune to petty mental disorders. It took Kirito a year to overcome PTSD yet it only took Subaru an episode to recover his sanity. Talk about a hero!\\n\\n\r\nEmilia, while supposedly being the main heroine of the story as well as Subaru\u2019s primary love interest is a fairly mysterious figure throughout pretty much the entirety of the show. For some reason, she physically embodies the appearance of the Jealous Witch that is known and feared by citizens all across the land and unbeknownst to Subaru also happens to be one of the candidates for the throne. Her other attributes consist of being strangely sympathetic towards people she has never met before, having a pet furby and being fairly cute. That right there about fully sums up her character which is quite unfortunate as she's supposed to be the main heroine as opposed to being a side hoe, completely overshadowed by Rem.\\n\\n\r\n\"Only I'm allowed to sniff Subaru-kun!\" Rem is first introduced as one of the 2 maids that govern Roswaal\u2019s mansion. When Subaru is hurt and taken to the mansion, she\u2019s appointed as his caretaker along with her older sister, Ram. She initially seems like a cute and innocent girl up until her psychopathic tendencies come rocking in and she brutally murders Subaru in cold blood without giving it a second thought. No one really seems to take that into consideration when labeling her to be the best gurl of da century but it is what it is. Unfortunately, she\u2019s probably the character on which the time resets took the biggest toll on as a huge chunk of her development was constantly being thrown out the window during the entirety of the mansion arc. This takes effect up until the premise of her entire character shifts to being Subaru's lovey-dovey, 2nd-rate love interest during the latter half of the series. Despite that, she still manages to take the cake for the best girl of the series due to an extreme lack of competition.\\n\\n\r\nProduced by studio White Fox, the art and animation really don't present anything new to the table. Although, one thing that sticks out in my mind is how well they were able to handle the tonal shifts the show makes regularly, most notably by effectively switching up the color palette from the usual bright and cheery NGNL-ish style to a more dark and brooding one. The character designs don't have a distinct style but do include a lot of variety between the individual characters. Subaru is noticeably plain-looking and dull, while the citizens that inhabit the fantasy world come off as flashy, with bright clothes and hair in every color imaginable, almost serving as to further alienate Subaru from the norm.\\n\\n\r\nIf Re:Zero had a strong suit, it certainly wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it lies within its music department. Despite the fact that like any other sensible man on this god-forsaken Earth, I proudly despise pop music with every fiber of my being, both of Re:Zero's ending and opening songs are admittedly catchy with a handful of decent OSTs to the side. While varied, the voice acting was pretty consistent throughout and most of the seiyuu were able to kick their game up a notch whenever shit hit the fan. Nonetheless, there are still some performances that either managed to evoke mixed feelings or just left a lot to be desired, with Petelguese being the prime example. Episode 15 felt like a comedy skit due to his constant laughter and overly-exaggerated mannerisms, killing any possible tension. Additionally, there's a scene in particular where he is just frantically laughing while the camera slowly zooms-in on Subaru's depraved expression as he screams and drools all over himself.. What? I realize that scene alone tops 95% of comedy anime out there but was that really all it took to boost it into the top 30? Not to mention how all of his lackeys from the Witch Cult also share his exaggerated tone, making the so-called \"antagonists\" of the show practically intolerable.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero to me is one of those series you can't help but enjoy no matter which side of the spectrum you've landed on. Even if you don't genuinely like the show, you can still get somewhat of a kick out of it for a variety of reasons. Because the paragraph I wrote looked extremely messy, I've summarized it in good ol' Rkpandey fashion (vote-bots are still in development, though):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n+ Semi-thriller\\n\r\n+ Subaru offing himself\\n\r\n+ Subaru getting killed\\n\r\n+ Overblown scenes and performances (enjoyable for all the wrong reasons)\\n\r\n+ Inflatable tube man\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n-  Extremely repetitive plot-twists\\n\r\n-  Generic\\n\r\n- Subaru\\n\r\n- Character caricatures\\n\r\n- Subaru\\n\r\n- Laughable antagonists (not a positive)\\n\r\n- Subaru\\n\\n\r\nNothing is worse than an over-inflated sense of self-importance.\\n\\n\r\nI don't expect nor want any diehard fans of this show to agree with me. The sole reason behind this review's existence is that you lot can hopefully understand where me and many others are coming from when thinking that Re:Zero is in fact not the second coming of Christ, as that is the best I can hope for when going against the norm like this. So in conclusion: Re:Zero is a torture-porn, flavor of the month show with an uninteresting cast and a bland, oversaturated premise far too reliant on constant plot twists in order to keep the viewer seated even after long passing the point of redundancy. It does a few things right and does try to deviate from the typical light novel adaptation by adding heavy emphasis on the dark fantasy setting it establishes early on. Unfortunately, most of these scenes are either too comical or far too overblown to be taken seriously and it holds no merit when compared to other dark fantasy anime like Berserk. On the other hand, the thriller appeal is still somewhat there until it goes off the rails during the last act and even then I'd be lying by saying I wasn't entertained while marathoning through the whole ordeal, albeit for all the wrong reasons.",

I binged 23 of its 25 episodes while sick at home with the flu, and by the end of it I'm not sure if that or the vomiting I did was worse. I know a lot of people aren't going to agree with this review, but I plead for you to take off your fan service blinders and tune in while I break down the psychological disasterRe:Zero truly is.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Re:Zero is a deconstruction of the fantasy/stuck in game genre, one I've never particularly been a fan of. Our \"noble\" protagonist, Subaru is magically transported to a mystical world where time travel is commonplace, the MC activates God Mode and chicks are all over his nether regions. Sound familiar? I decided to start the series based on a friend's recommendation that it was like Steins;Gate. I will tell you from personal experience that the biggest similarity between the two is the existence of a punctuation mark in their two titles. That or the fact they're the same amount of episodes. For the remaining episodes, writers cater to the libidos of pathetic teenagers by combining the worst elements of shows like Sword Art Online and other overpowered harem titles and do a fantastic job evading any responsibility developing intelligent plot lines. Non-cohesive potholes are disguised as \"psychological\" or \"edgy\" and the main character whines continuously like a three year old who lost his balloon.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most notorious blemishes on Re:Zero's resume is the messy shifts its tone makes. It's one thing for a show to be edgy, but when there's no legitimate segway between a slapstick joke and an emotional gut punch, it leaves the viewer confused. Bunguo Stray Dogs has this same issue, which ends up making neither the comedy funny or the shocks effective. It's like watching someone comically slip on a banana peel cut short by an image of puppies being boiled in acid. That's not edgy, it's just a fucking disaster. It's feasible for a show to contain multiple genres, but they must be developed with finesse or else the viewer is left watching the equivalent of a bipolar teen not knowing what they want to be in life. The unfortunate part is how the majority of viewers are so desensitized to this streamlined method of script writing that it seems normal and acceptable. The writers could've benefitted from watching shows like Steins;Gate and HunterXHunter in order to learn how to effectively balance humor with serious or cerebral scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the story seems as though it's being written week to week. Instead of taking the time to carve out an effective story, writers use sporadic shock value to trick the viewer into thinking what they're watching is good. Their adrenaline is pumping, and it almost creates a sense of tunnel vision in order to distract them from the real issues the anime has. Shows like Game of Thrones have shock value as well, but the superb writing, effective timing and added characterization separates it from phonies like Re:Zero. Unfortunately, unlike other shock and awe disasters like Akame ga Kill, Re:Zero fans will defend these contrived elements because of the time resets and other excusable aspects of the series. In that respect, the director achieved his goal of pure entertainment value. It appeals to the masses. I, like anyone enjoys a good cliffhanger from time to time. However, Re:Zero gives The Walking Dead a run for its money in the sheer amount of forced close-calls in its episode conclusions. It gets incredibly annoying if you're bingeing it, just like one of my few issues with Kaiji.\\n\\n\r\nInitially I thought the time-resetting element could be incorporated effectively into the already entertaining first 3 episodes of the series. I was dead wrong. This aspect ends up existing as little more than a plot device to excuse weak writing and character development. Subaru screws up, doesn't atone for his mistakes and tries again a different way. I get that this takes place in a fantasy world, but what is the viewer learning from a kid that cries about \"they didn't do what I wanted them to do! Wahhhhh!\" He shows little to no respect for the world he gets transported to, and instead of learning from his errors, repeats them with somebody or something else. Since he's still a kid, this exists again as a cop out for writing legitimate character growth throughout the series. However, he probably acts close to how many other people his age would if they were thrown into a supposed \"game-like\" world... With blatant disregard to everything around them. In some ways, the writers really put off a pretentious vibe for the lack of responsibility Subaru has in his actions. It left a bad taste in my mouth and seemed as though they were sticking their tongues out at critics everywhere like \"I'm writing this and there's nothing you can do about it, nah!\"\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Re:Zero offers a plethora of eligible waifus to choose from. There's the emotional shy one, the lolli, the yandere and everything in between. Not to mention, they all end up falling for Subaru in the end. It IS 2016 people, recycling the same harem formula with duplicated generic tropes for characters got old about 20 years ago. No character in the entire show, sans our antagonist, is unforgettable, unless you're speaking from purely lusting reasons. Every time a new female character was introduced it felt like another nail in Re:Zero's coffin of legitimacy. Character development isn't formed from generating multiple cardboard-cutouts and assigning them to becoming romantically involved with our MC. Regardless of what you think you're interpreting as development, it all exists as a facade to promote its narrative... whatever that may be.\\n\\n\r\nBut what about our Lord and Savior, Subaru???\\n\\n\r\nOne important piece of a television series that can make or break a viewer's experience, is the ability for us to relate to facets of a character's personality or their cause for actions in the world. Unfortunately, Subaru exhibits neither of these. Throughout Re:Zero's painstaking 25 episodes he learns virtually nothing about his previous mistakes, and his actions towards other characters are unjustifiable or entirely belligerent. He disrespects others in the world, and thinks the best way to fix his blunders is to just rewind time again. If only it were that easy. Unfortunately, not enough intelligence exists on this planet for anyone to call him out for being an idiot. Everyone just goes along with his irritating behavior because he's an \"outsider\". Some would be quick to call Subaru a selfless \"hero\", but he blindly helps strangers he's known for about five minutes. This clearly isn't a reflection of his personality, but is out of character and exists to propel the story forward. He's helping people because \"he's supposed to\" and continuously bites the hand that feeds him, and always seems to come out scott free. He's an oblivious moron lacking any bit of hindsight, but it's alright because he ultimately gets all the chicks, and that's all that matters right?\\n\\n\r\nWhew, now that I'm completely out of breath I can mention the few positives I can take from Re:Zero. In no particular order:\\n\\n\r\n1. The animation is pretty damn good. It reminds me a lot of No Game No Life with regard to the vivid, bright colored environments and attractive character models. White Fox at its finest\\n\r\n2. The premise is great. Execution is abysmal, but at least I can ponder about what could've been.\\n\r\n3. It's oddly entertaining at times, if for no other reason than to watch a train wreck in progress. \\n\r\n4. The laundry list of waifus ensure that all plebs can be satisfied. Most of the female characters are oddly sexy in their own way.\\n\r\n5. The soundtrack is consistent, pleasant and well mixed. I mean, it damn well better be based on the composer's credentials.\\n\\n\r\nThere, I did it. Parts of me are baffled as to how this is the 35th highest rated show on MAL as this review is completed, but after the giant Erased debacle from a few seasons ago nothing really surprises me anymore. I hope at least those individuals deliberating on whether or not to watch Re:Zero have gained some valuable information in this review. Don't be so easily deceived, use your head when you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, while I'm disappointed that this is the same studio that put out gems like Steins;Gate and Katanagatari, I'm not that surprised. The director and writers successfully catered to the mass appeal of shock and awe as well as shameless fan service when they wrote Re:Zero. The writing is shit and the characters suck, but I guess if you're looking for a cheap thrill or to be hip with your fellow weeaboos, you might consider watching this pompous piece of fiction. Thanks for those who pushed me to write this review, I had a lot of (cough) \"fun\" reliving my sickness in order to produce this critical analysis.

            "content": "This anime doesn't make sense at all. I can agree that the show has an interesting premise and tries it best to be something original but in most episodes it seems like the writer itself doesn't really know where to take the story.  Subaru is just transported into this fantasy world and immediately accepts it without ever questioning where or how he got here or even try to at least get back to his own world. The characters are simply one-dimensional and have no personality at all and just seem like lifeless robots who are simply their to complete the harem circle. The reasonsSubaru does things is simply illogical. The two maids are simply there for fan service and serve nothing to the plot at all except being \"waifu\" material. The relationship between Subaru and Emilia felt fake and forced to be honest and in my eyes don't really see why he even likes her as it doesn't feel genuine .This series could have had great potential but after the ending it was pure trash and i don't understand how anyone calls this a masterpiece. The last episode felt disappointing and felt like many things were missing like some characters were completely tossed on the side. Overall this show is a mess with a cast of bland characters and a weird main character with no intelligence.",

I highly recommend this anime to people of the fantasy gener who don't mind glor and are looking for a deep,dark, emotional,action packed anime.",

            "content": "*this review contains spoilers* *read at your own discretion*\r\nI was highly skeptical when I first started watching Re: Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu since I was under the misconception that it was another one those animes with eye-catching visual presentation (mainly the anime cover) and generic fantasy premise, struggling to separate itself from similar shows that make use of the weary \u201ctransported into another world\u201d concept by aiming to be a lighthearted fantasy story mixed with gore, death and dark psychological elements. \r\nI honestly thought I was going to dislike this show despite the original creator\u2019s, Tappei Nagatsuki, intention to showcase time travel in away that could easily be associated with checkpoints or save points in videogames: A magical ability that allows you to go back in time to visited locations and (most likely) at the very start of experienced events. You might be asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nWell, all you need to do is die a painful death before it can be triggered. It sounded like the perfect recipe for exhausting repetitiveness, especially after I learned a little bit about the kind of character that obtains this ability. That\u2019s not all.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that every character would exhibit a wide range of stereotypes (one per character) that reinforces their external appearances and vice versa without any small hints of uniqueness to their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, the main character is a hikikomori, modern otaku poisoned by anime and games that is portrayed as a hot-headed, zany, rash and powerless young man. One day, out of nowhere, this anonymous young hero embarks on an epic journey in another realm.  \\n\\n\r\nHe wears a tracksuit and has \u201csanpaku eyes\u201d. The guy becomes the target of affection from many of the girls in the fantasy world he has been transported to, without developing meaningful relationships with them first. \\n\\n\r\nHe builds a harem that consists of clich\u00e9, boring and uninspired females such as mary sues\u2019, tsunderes, lolis\u2019s and so on, becomes super powerful somehow, makes friends, overcomes any obstacle he encounters, defeats the main antagonist all by himself and successfully wins the heart of the main heroine. \\n\\n\r\nIn other words, he could be best described as the typical shounen hero and the plot is basically about how he lives the ideal life in a fictitious world that many of us dreams of having.  \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like the most unorthodox characterization and story, does it? However, after completing this fantastic anime with abundant originality and suspenseful moments, allow me to elaborate more on my reasons for giving Re: Zero a score of 10/10 overall. \\n\\n\r\nIf you keep reading this review, you\u2019ll understand that everything I\u2019ve said about the protagonist, female characters and plot in the example I just provided is NOT entirely true. I\u2019m gonna try to keep it short. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts with our main character Natsuki Subaru who is instantaneously transported without warning to a parallel fantasy world while he was on his way back home from the convenience store. Being the massive sucker for anime and games that he is, our effervescent and hopeful Subaru contemplates out loud the various possibilities of finding himself in an unknown world that looks and feels like playing an RPG or MMORPG game. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a while, Subaru is quickly disappointed upon realizing that he doesn\u2019t have any special powers or abilities fitting for him according to the \u201cmain hero that has been summoned to another world by the main heroine\u201d pattern or whatever. *rolls eyes* \\n\\n\r\nHis unflagging \u201cmeta\u201d prattling and wandering are both temporarily halted by a somewhat unforeseen encounter with 3 threatening-looking thugs in an alleyway, attempting to make him yield to their intimidating demands. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, despite being a shut-in NEET, Subaru displays (to a certain degree) physical prowess and hand-to-hand combat knowledge earned from his workout routines and manages to overwhelm the group of thugs\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThat is until he shifts from \u201cI\u2019ll mow these guys down and make them fuel for my shining future\u201d to a pathetic, lily-livered person who prostrates and begs for forgiveness after noticing one of the 3 thugs wielding a glinting knife. \\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist gets beaten to a pulp but, luckily for him, it doesn\u2019t take long before a small girl thief with longish blond hair named Felt dashes past them since she is being chased by the mysterious, beautiful silver- haired half elf and spirit arts user \u201cmain heroine\u201d Emilia (although she initially goes by the name Satella). It turns out, Felt stole Emilia\u2019s insignia and she desires to get it back no matter what it takes. \\n\\n\r\nAfter interrogating the thugs and Subaru himself, she refuses to let the thugs continue with their act of injustice and decides to save Subaru from his wretched situation with the assistance of her cute artificial cat spirit Puck/Pack (I prefer the name Puck\u2026you know, like Puck from Berserk ^_^). \\n\\n\r\nThe thugs were forced to retreat but Emilia and Puck stayed to heal Subaru\u2019s wounds under Emilia\u2019s pretext \u201cI still have some questions to ask you otherwise I would\u2019ve left you behind\u201d instead of resuming her search without a second thought. \\n\\n\r\nSubaru wishes to return the favor by offering his services for the sake of retrieving her stolen insignia and later at night, they locate its whereabouts: a loot cellar in the slums of the capital city of the Kingdom of Lugunica (the country where Subaru and Emilia are). \\n\\n\r\nOnce inside the loot cellar, Subaru discovers the dismembered dead body of old man Rom, the master of the loot cellar. Emilia, concerned about how Subaru is doing, enters the loot cellar and follows the same fate as him. \\n\\n\r\nTheir lives come to an end but Subaru immediately reawakens in the middle of a familiar event he has already experienced. What\u2019s more puzzling for Subaru is how he ends up experiencing other events that leave him with feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu but with significant differences to his first \u201cdream\u201d or \u201cillusion\u201d.   \\n\\n\r\nSkipping forward, Subaru is finally able to fully understand what is going on\u2026okay, actually, it took him dying 3 TIMES in total before he was able to fully understand what was going on (What an idiot but he is not mentally retarded, meaning he could get smarter ;3). \\n\\n\r\nIt turns out that he does possess a magical ability which he decides to call \u201cReturn by Death\u201d, a power that activates every time Subaru dies. It enables him to reverse time back to a randomly selected checkpoint, relive that segment of his life in order to change it to a future where he successfully accomplishes one or many objectives without dying and move on. \\n\\n\r\nIn my intro, I expressed my fear about potentially disliking Re: Zero because of Subaru and his \u201cReturn by Death\u201d. The first story arc (episodes 1-3) made me think how this anime could turn into a boring and repetitive run-of-the-mill experience in future arcs since our main character is constantly failing and traveling back in time to relive the exact same scenarios repeatedly. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the plot proceeds onwards without showing any indication that it would slowly transformed into a \u201cf****** waste of time\u201d thanks to Subaru picking up little by little new pieces of information that were previously unknown to him and try figuring out the best course of action in each complication he runs into. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout almost the entire anime, he is unable to come up with well-contrived solutions but his improvisations and support from powerful allies never failed to impress me. \\n\\n\r\nThis direction delivered diversity and excitement. It made everything less predictable too. Soon enough, I was mesmerized by the story and couldn\u2019t resist the urge of wanting to know what was gonna happen next by the end of each episode. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s another thing this anime was good at: Cliffhangers that will fuel your desire to marathon the whole thing in one sitting. \\n\\n\r\nSure, I\u2019ll admit that this show left a lot of unexplored plot points and unanswered questions such as the royal selection, Subaru\u2019s strong spirit affinity and Yin magic, the identity of the pale gold-haired maid in the flashback of episode 11, the connection between Subaru and the Witch of Envy known as Satella, the reason for \u201csummoning\u201d Subaru and the one behind it, Roswaal\u2019s motive for wanting to kill the dragon, etc. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, due to time constrains, the director Masaharu Watanabe and everyone else involved in Re: Zero\u2019s production decided that it would be best to skip and alter some scenes from the web novel/light novel like Roswaal telling Rem to not stop Subaru in case he decided to go to the castle located in the capital city where the royal selection would take place, Al\u2019s background or Subaru trying to kill Crusch with a spoon after she refuses to aid him in killing the Witch\u2019s Cult and replace it with him just walking up to her menacingly, only to be stopped by Wilhelm in episode 16. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, these factors never became detriments for the evolution of the story since there was a decent number of mysteries and other questions that were prioritized and added more complexity. The pacing was okay for the most part but every time it was increased, that\u2019s when s*** got real. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, it is undeniable that this anime adaptation of Re: Zero did a good job at telling a thought-provoking story despite its small lack of loyalty to the original source material. I guess we should be thankful that they didn\u2019t \u201c100% faithfully\u201d crammed 9 light novel volumes worth of content in 25 anime episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, this show would be the equivalent of having a buffalo taking a diarrhea dump in your ear right now (yes, that was an AVGN reference ;D). Believe me, it was for the best.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning until the bitter end, Subaru is the kind of MC you will grow to dislike, like or both simultaneously depending on how you view his journey and development. \\n\\n\r\nHe is not some overpowered protagonist who can inexplicably beat anyone. You could describe him as your average Joe or comic relief type of character but that\u2019s hardly scratching the surface. Despite acting like a rambunctious little brat who likes to babble and giving the impression that he might have the intelligence of a brick in a few occasions, there is more to him than meets the eye. \\n\\n\r\nSubaru is actually a very sensitive, flawed and vulnerable character who has spend his life (back in the country of Japan) taking the easiest route in every tough or bothersome situation and secluding himself in his room to play video games, read mangas or watch animes.He is a teenager who became a modern otaku in order to escape the realities of his life back in Japan but once he realized that the fantasy world he has been transported to wasn\u2019t the ultimate dream of escapism come true, Subaru had no other choice than to see things as they were rather than thinking something like \u201cat the end of the day, this is just a game\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nHis meeting with Emilia and others as well as his \u201cReturn by Death\u201d ability set in motion a chain of events that taught him in the most brutal and unforgiving fashion the importance of being hard-working. Plus, it drastically changed how he saw the concepts of pity and compassion. This was likely because he mostly interacted with people in the virtual world. He acted uncaring towards others due to his desire of avoiding getting too emotional by making fun of them. He used to think of it as troublesome. After all, he wanted to live a life full of convenience and enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nHis antics are both his best attempts at being friendly with others and his self-preservation mechanism. Logically, like every normal human being, he has his mental and emotional limitations. Now that he had to deal with these heavy issues in real life, Subaru started to understand that there was a whole different level of weight to them. No matter where he was, the universe wasn\u2019t going to conspire in his favor. If he wanted something, he needed to work hard to get it. If he truly wanted to make close friends, he needed to start being more honest with himself and the ones who moved his heart.   \\n\\n\r\nHe is not going to win any awards with his intellect, yes, but after seeing him memorizing small but helpful details from previous timelines during the first 3 episodes such as Lugunica having their own organization that functioned like a police force in the form of the Kingdom Knights and using that fact against the group of thugs in episode 2 or Puck\u2019s \u201cworking hours\u201d and using that to quickly instruct him to defend Emilia from Elsa\u2019s attack in episode 3, I thought there was no f****** way he didn\u2019t have the potential to come up with carefully calculated plans in the future. \\n\\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t always win on his own merits but like I said before: his improvisations and support from powerful allies never failed to impress me (well, now that I think about it, having good luck was required in some cases too). I honestly don\u2019t understand why there are many people who think that he seemingly goes from being an idiot to a shrewd person in less than a blink of an eye, without any logical explanation or proper buildup. \\n\\n\r\nHe is basically stuck in-between the two. Later on, he leans toward being smarter and less stupid. That\u2019s all there is to it. He tries to remain positive by being silly while persevering against extreme hardships and protecting the people he has come to care about. \\n\\n\r\nThis includes Emilia who he putted on a pedestal since he initially saw her as his savior and bewitching lady, the central pillar that sustained his deluded world where he was the hero fated to carry out her bidding. The kind and lovable \u201cmain heroine\u201d he would end up together with, no matter what he did or said. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, I thought he wasn\u2019t serious and was just messing around with the whole \u201cI\u2019m the main character of this fantasy world and Emilia\u2019s knight\u201d due to his \u201cReturn by Death\u201d and achievements in arcs 1 (episodes 1-3) and 2 (episodes 4-11). Nonetheless, between episodes 13-18, Subaru slowly falls into despair and insanity. \\n\\n\r\nHe betrays Emilia\u2019s trust and instead of patching things up with Emilia by telling her that everything he has done was for her sake and that she owed a great debt to him, Emilia distances herself from Subaru since she was no longer capable of understanding and trusting him. \\n\\n\r\nHis deluded world intensifies even further to the point where he completely ignores what the other royal candidates (Priscilla, Crusch and Anastasia) expect from him in exchange for their help to save Emilia from the Witch\u2019s Cult in Roswaal\u2019s domain. As a result, they degraded Subaru and with no one else he could depend on, he heads back to the Roswaal mansion and Arlam village with the lovely demon maid Rem\u2026only for him to despair even further. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime didn\u2019t depict anything about his past but during his self-loathing rant in episode 18 (one of the best episodes I\u2019ve ever seen in my existence thus far) we hear him say stuff about how he had wasted his life up to that point. He never did anything productive with his freedom. His powerlessness and incompetence resulted in his \u201crotten\u201d character, according to him. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, he decides to \u201cstart over from zero\u201d (Rem said it to him first and he pondered her words until he conceded) thanks to Rem\u2019s emotional support and her love confession to him. Plus, she shared with Subaru her vision of their future IF they had left everything behind by running away together (man, such a great prolonged scene ^_^). \\n\\n\r\nHis newfound resolve to become a \u201creal\u201d hero and go through with it, made me feel satisfied enough to forgive him for turning Rem down. He never stopped loving Emilia and Rem accepted his feelings. On the other hand, he did stopped thinking about how unfair it was that Emilia didn\u2019t love him the same way he did.\\n\\n\r\nIn episodes 19-25, Subaru shows signs of maturing by being less selfish and more considerate toward people like when he acknowledged that the inhabitants of Arlam village had their own opinions that differed from his own or Julius\u2019s apology. He even took responsability for his past actions and what he said by apologizing sincerely to Emilia and Julius (although, he still subconsciously resents him). He redeemed himself in more ways than one.     \\n\\n\r\nHe might not be one of the best MCs ever but he was awesome for all the right reasons. Oh yeah, I almost forgot: He DOESN\u2019T build a harem and I don\u2019t think Nagatsuki-sensei wants him to build one either.          \\n\\n\r\nRem\u2019s background, character development and relationship progress with Subaru were delightful to watch. Now, I could easy write about her just as much as I did with Subaru but I\u2019ll refrain from doing so. The reason is because I\u2019m still trying to make this review as short as possible. >_< \\n\\n\r\nThe first few times we see her, she humorously makes fun of Subaru along with her twin sister Ram. She respects her sister to the point of worship and holds guilt toward her due to an incident in the past. Because of it, she used to think of herself as inferior. She falls deeply in love with Subaru and becomes one of his most loyal followers after he saves and teaches her about self-worth. \\n\\n\r\nRem definitely went beyond the obsessed yandere archetype we are so accustomed to in other animes. Otherwise, why didn\u2019t she fall for Subaru without any effort on his part?. Why did she accept that Subaru\u2019s heart belonged to Emilia?. Feel free to disagree with me. Regardless, she was a great character just like Subaru.\\n\\n\r\nEmilia\u2019s character was good too. Unlike Subaru and Rem, she didn\u2019t get the same treatment in terms of character development but at least we were given more info about how she thinks of herself in the last episode. That sounds like a good starting point, right?. \\n\\n\r\nAfter she was introduced, I immediately thought she was going to follow the tsundere archetype to the letter. I was wrong. She was something between a tsundere and dandere although that\u2019s still not good enough to describe her personality. \\n\\n\r\nShe is good natured, independent, likes to take care of others though she refuses to admit it, she sometimes acts like a child and she is discriminated against because she looks like the Witch of Envy.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t have any major problems with her, except that she hardly gets any screen time in the second half of the anime. Wilhelm was a badass character. I loved his background and interactions with Subaru.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the rest of the supporting cast was strong and likable. Their backgrounds remained a mystery but their personality traits were special even if they weren\u2019t fully fleshed-out characters. \\n\\n\r\nThey each served more than one purpose in the story which kept them from being boring and one-dimensional. Lastly, I think it would have helped if they had reduced the amount of supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI only had two complains. The first one is that the animation dipped in quality more than once after a while in fight scenes or dialogue scenes and the second one is the use of CGI in background characters (maybe CGI was used in some other stuff). \\n\\n\r\nI liked everything else. The character designs, the vibrant colors, the detailed facial expressions and features during moments when the character\u2019s faces were zoomed in on, etc. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought the opening themes were ok. The ending themes were great. My favorite was the first ending called Styx Helix by Myth & Roid. The soundtrack done by Kenichiro Suehiro was outstanding and the Seiyuus/Seiyus were all fabulous. \\n\\n\r\nEntertainment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDo I really need to explain myself? Re: Zero was fun, sad, it kept me on the edge of my seat and so on. This anime was as entertaining as it could possibly get.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.6/10\\n\\n\r\nI believe Re: Zero is the best anime of 2016. If you don\u2019t think so, that\u2019s totally fine. This show was well executed and unique. It was deep and memorable. It was a refreshing take on the overused \u201ctransported into another world\u201d concept. \\n\\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t perfect but then again nothing in this world is perfect and besides, the story is far from over. That is why I\u2019m going to give extra support to Re: Zero by rising my overall score, buying the light novels and keeping my fingers crossed for a second season. Thank you for your time and have a great day! ;D   \\n",

            "content": "we have ourselves something interesting and relatively new as far as the cliche setting goes. Let's start by saying what this is in terms of genre. You will have your typical teenager coming over to another world. Elves, demons, magic, medieval times - as far as this goes we've all seen this before. However, as far as recommending this I would tell almost everyone to watch it. It doesn't matter if you like this type of show, it's not the dominant trait of it. But let's explain everything.\r\nWatch if:\r\n- You generally like shounen-type anime,\r\n- Your idea of watching something involves understanding and thinking,\r\n- Fantasy isyour drug of choice,\\n\\n\r\n- You appreciate visual fanfare and eye-candy.\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch if:\\n\\n\r\n- You hate cliffhangers,\\n\\n\r\n- You need everything spelled-out in terms of plot and character development.\\n\\n\r\n*ANYTHING BELOW THIS POINT MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMy personal ranking as far as story goes up with the other \"masterpieces\". Probably on par with things like \"Steins:gate\" and \"Death Note\"(first half of it). Do not look for similarities in terms of setting or even the story itself there though. What I mean by this is that I believe the idea for the anime is great and somewhat unique. This is inevitably tied to both story and characters, but I will put my thoughts down here - before you get bored of reading.\\n\\n\r\nThe main concept (apart from \"person in another world\") here is that the protagonist will ressurect after death. Not only that, but he will turn back time as well. The idea is easiest explained as an \"auto-save\" feature in real life. He will go back to a point, remember all his choices and will be able to change events somewhat. There are two ways I found one might look at it. You could treat this as the typical hero power an MC gets in this type of story, but I believe that to be incorrect. Another way of looking at it, as I believe the creators might have intended, is that the guy has no special features about him. He isn't some long lost prince, has no sword coming out of his butt or a magical eye that strips females of their wits and garments. There is some kind of curse on him (let's call it auto-save curse) and he will make the best of that bad situation. What you typically see in shows of this genre is the hero making choices that are ALWAYS correct. If you ever thought outside the proverbial box while watching the genre you'd have at some point asked yourself at least one of the below (or a variation of it):\\n\\n\r\n- \"How does he always get to the right place, how does he even know where to go?\"\\n\\n\r\n- \"How come he talks to this person he just met like they know eachother forever and gives them advice?\"\\n\\n\r\n- \"Seriously, you just got to this world... why do you know everything and do the right thing every single time? Can you read their minds?\"\\n\\n\r\nFor me it's utterly frustrating that heroes just come and take the reins, guiding everyone, including the viewer through the cliche plot without a single hiccup. Liek \"Ok, so I am in this world, and we need to kill the demon lord\" - 15 episodes later they are at the demon lord castle, walking to his throne room. How did he even know which way it is...\\n\\n\r\nIn this show you get to see what an actual human being might do, if put in the same situation. He will make MISTAKES. Luckily his \"auto-save\" lets him try and try again until he gets it right, or as close to that as possible given the circumstances. If you never thought about the above cliche you will after you watch this show. This is also the most compelling reason for watching that I can give you.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 9/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals are stunning. It's pretty, it's colorful, things are animated and move almost like they should. Given some of the gore I feel it might have been a smart idea by the animators to deliberately conceal some of the more gruesome shots - we get to avoid the omnipresent Rays of Light(Tm), while at the same time we know what happened. Some parts might be too light-hearted and maybe attention to detail could have been better with the scenery, but there really is nothing to complain about. You will find that it's pretty, I promise.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the OP, most of it anyway. There's absolutely noting bad to say about the VA's as well. Sound is not intrusive, it plays its role, builds up tension and helps the overall vibe. While it is the lowest point of the show, that is only because everything else is so great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBread and butter of the series. While the idea and story are both great, they would not work without the characters. The MC is actually a typical teenager. They made him a bit too dense, but that is most likely so he doesn't intimidate teenage viewers and they don't feel too inferior. Most any teenager should be able to relate to him, given the fact he has no special powers and tends to actually have emotions that resemble a human being. While this sounds negative, it is far from it. Most shows present you with a sock puppet that will headbutt walls, peek on girls and shout out skill names while disposing of enemies. This guy thinks, analyzes, makes mistakes and LEARNS from them. He is also a role model type, so it's safe to let your teenager watch this, if you're a parent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters have layers, but are not rushing to the MC to tell him their life story. They tend to be very secretive and through decent plot manipulation (and use of \"auto-save\") the MC gets to discover that some are not what they seem. Genuine relationships develop, sometimes cut short but the MC dying and such.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that everyone should at least try. No matter if you're just looking for a casual shounen or you'd like to explore the more interesting aspects of it, this anime will deliver. The only downside is that clever use of cliffhangers makes you want more. As such, for those who hate waiting to see what happens, one might need to wait for all 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWholeheartedly recommended.",

I was on edge every second of the show. As I was someone who waited every week for the next episode to come out, the waiting felt like forever. I haven't read the manga, nor the light novel yet, but I intend to. By doing this it will show just how good of a job the studio did in trying to capture what the writer was trying to picture. \r\nWhat makes this show sogood?!\\n\r\n- The story is always interesting, it is always enjoyable and never really draws you back\\n\r\n- The personalities of the characters are good, really makes you care for them. You may either love or hate the mc, based on some of the decisions he makes later on throughout the anime\\n\r\n- The artwork is very beautiful.\\n\r\n- The music is good and the intros are pretty catchy\\n\r\n- The series has pretty good comedy, but not so much you can't take the characters seriously, not much comedy towards the end of the series\\n\r\n- Has a pretty solid ending, but there are a few answers left unanswered, but you have to watch it to figure out what those answers are and I won't spoil anything for you.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that not everyone is going to love this show as much as I do. But seriously give this anime a chance. I'm sure somewhere it'll catch your attention. There's nothing wrong with disliking this anime, it may not be your cup of tea. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anyone, unless you aren't a big fan of gore, as it can get pretty gorey at certain points throughout the anime!",

            "content": "Give no fks about these crying babies giving it a low mark, they're just some remfags who could not handle the fact that Rem was not in the last episode.\r\nRe: Zero is one of the best anime recently released. The protagonist, Natsuki                    Subaruis high school student sent to another world. He is a shut in NEET who presumably plays rpgs and has watched a few animes containing the boy sent to another world trope.(somewhat affecting his attitude and actions) \r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\r\n What really ties this seriestogether are the characters specifically the main character Natsuki Subaru. Subaru while mostly powerless in this new world, cannot die. Whenever Subaru dies, he returns to a specific point in time. The conditions and limits of this power are mostly unexplained(Not going to give too much away there). Subaru's interactions with other characters are never the same in each time line because his death changes his perspective with each time. This allows us to see multiple sides of the same characters. Subaru's interactions with characters don't even necessarily improve with every reincarnation. Subaru's character development is not on a straight line. He is a realistic protagonist in that his actions frequently won't be liked by the viewer. There are other characters central to the plot but a lot of their emotional development spoils the plot. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\r\n The soundtrack always fits the mood of the show and it has a nice therapeutic feel. And the openings and endings... Holy duck, masterpieces.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 7/10\\n\r\n Well, this is where the show falters a bit. The CGI backgrounds and background characters feel somewhat out of place sometimes but there can be some truly beautifully animated scenes despite this.(Don't worry even the bad parts aren't new Berzerk bad or even worse.... Food Fight..... (shudders)).\\n\\n\r\nPLOT: 10/10\\n\r\n The show really does a great job with the plot for every alternate timeline it makes. There are some truly dark ways the story plays out depending on Subaru's actions or lack there of. There are usually emotional moments regardless of the timeline. It may be kind of weird at the beggining, but as the episodes go by, it goes getting better and better, and when you think it could not get any better, they prove you wrong.",

            "content": "Re:Zero -The Aesthetic Appeal-\r\n2016 has seen a good number of entertaining anime. Shows like ReLIFE, Food Wars The Second Plate, Kiznaiver, Planetarian, Erased, My Hero Academia, Hey! My Name is Sakumoto, And You Thought There is Never a Girl Online, Flying Witch, High School Fleet, Heavy Object, and a number of other anime that I'm not going to name right now. The point is, a lot of really entertaining anime have come out this year. Among those anime is Re:Zero Starting Life in Another World.\r\nRe:Zero is an anime that exploded in popularity almost overnight, and I'm not saying this justbecause it's my favorite anime of 2016. I remember when I finished watching the first episode, which had been split into two parts, and then going onto facebook the next day and finding a facebook page already created. That in itself wouldn't have been shocking. However, this page already had over 30,000 likes. Since then, that page has expanded and now has around 160,000 likes. There are also two more pages that I follow, one of which has 155,000 likes and the other with around 60,000.\\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn't enough, then there's also the fact that this anime has received more votes on Crunchyroll per episode within the first few days than any other series. This anime has been so hyped that I'm pretty sure it's already beaten numerous other popular series in terms of how many fans it's gained within a short time frame.\\n\\n\r\nThe first aspect of the series that I want to talk about is the aesthetic appeal. Re:Zero is an anime that boasts some beautiful artwork and what I like to call animated cinematography. Throughout the series we're given numerous large, sweeping shots of cityscapes, landscapes, and various gorgeous locations all rendered in breathtaking detail. I was particularly impressed with the sunset shots, which seemed to be a favorite of this anime. There are many of them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed about these shots wasn't just how pretty they were, but how they showed us the size of this world. The world of Re:Zero is massive. I remember watching the first episode when Subaru is first sent to this Lugnica. We're given a kind of close up of Natsuki Subaru, and then it pulls back before shifting into a wide view of the capital city of Lugnica. Just looking at how wide and sprawling that cityscape is as it mixes with the viridian of the forest, and then you have that interesting view of the castle in the far distance was incredible. It was scenes like this that made me really think about how utterly massive this world must be.\\n\\n\r\nAnother visual appeal of the series was how diverse Lugnica's people are. Throughout the series we're given more than just humans. There's lizardmen, dog people, cat people, and they're not just humans with cat ears. A fare few of them look legitimately like anthropomorphic animals. I even remember seeing one person who looked like an otter in priest robes and an alligator. Even the characters that you only see passing Subaru throughout various scenes gives the series a sense of their being a lot more to this world than the small story about Subaru and his misadventures.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of Subaru, can I just say that I really like his character design. First, he's got these sort of narrowed eyes and slicked back hair, which are generally associated with thugs in Japan. It actually doesn't necessarily fit the \u201cotaku stereotype\u201d and has often made me wonder if his looks might be part of the reason he became a NEET. I feel like there's a backstory behind his appearance and how people back in his world associated with them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, of course, we can't forget the tracksuit. The tracksuit is actually an Otaku stereotype in Japan. I don't know how true it is since I've never been to Japan, but I've read on several blogs that a lot people who fall under the Otaku/NEET/Hikkikomori stereotype wear tracksuits because it's easy to change into and out of, and these types of people generally never leave their house except to buy food. This is actually the reason I like seeing Subaru in the tracksuit. Thanks to how unique this anime is among other isekai anime, seeing this stereotype taken and used in a way that disregards most of what we expect from this genre makes his outfit stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, if we're talking about main characters, then there's no way I can forget the heroine. From the moment Emilia was introduced, I was in love with her character design. Her unique appearance practically screams main heroine in all caps. First, she's the only character with silver hair. Her eyes are purple, but the pupils are green, which is an interesting artistic touch and makes me wonder if this has something to do with her status as a half elf.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of half elf, Emilia really falls into that archetype with her short, pointed ears. They immediately stood out when I first noticed them, and there's a nice bit of asymmetry going with the added white rose that's asfixed to the right side of her hair, and the butterfly hair clip that's attached to her bangs on the other side. The flower is a lot more prominent, especially because the purple ribbon offsets the white rose, which is compliments her hair.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing her face, Emilia's introduction has her wearing a white dress with purple accents and some gold thrown in for color. I don't think I need to mention this, but the outfit really flatters her. From the very first glance, the outfit is designed to make her stand out. Furthermore, this isn't the only outfit that we see her in. Because this anime is about Subaru. Emilia isn't always seen since she's usually busy learning how to become a ruler. To make up for her lack of screen time, the director has her change clothes numerous times as a way to make her stand out more. I know some people who will debate this point, but I think it does a good job of that. I can always notice Emilia the moment she's entered a scene, and my eyes tend to track her even when she's not necessarily the subject of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nTo top it off, Emilia is almost always seen with Puck, the cute mascot character who is actually likable. Puck is one of those characters who's cuteness as been maximized. He's like that adorable kitty you want to take home with you. In some ways, I might even call him a show stealer. What makes his aesthetic even more appealing is how he can transform into a huge ass monster that's anything but cute.\\n\\n\r\nThere are numerous other characters who've been given a design that enhances the visual appeal and makes the anime shine. Rem and Ram are two such characters. They're maids and twin sisters. Now, maids are sort of a staple in Japanese culture. Maids often appear in anime and manga because they symbolize what many Japanese consider to be appealing in women: attractive, subservient, and cute. Rem and Ram are the characters who I feel were designed to encapsulate the \u201cmoe\u201d character archetype.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most anime, which have threadbare maid designs that are meant to be more sexually appealing, and are often worn on the character with the largest amount of cleavage, the designs on Rem and Ram are a bit more modest. They strike a decent balance between being sexy and being functional. I also like how they're contrasting Red and Blue hair and eyes make them stand out from each other.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like there was no expense spared when producing this anime. I don't even want to think about what kind of budget this series had. Not only was the diverse world and myriad of characters gorgeous to look at from every angle, but the animation feels incredibly fluid from the first frame to the last. While I did notice a few fudge ups with some visual effects, overall, I feel like this anime had some of the best animation I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI think this sort of fluid animation can be seen best in the fight with Elsa. The magical effects actually looked real. When Emilia and Puck were shooting ice spikes at Elsa like fireworks at a festival, they looked like actual spears of ice being hurtled towards a target, and when they struck something, they actually created a freezing effect along the ground. Incidentally, this freezing effect was used to trap Elsa's foot.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of this battle was actually when Rienhard appeared. I really loved how they made Elsa jump around and run along the walls. The way the animators blurred and stretched her body to make it look like she was moving at super human speeds was an interesting visual choice, and when we were given a first-person perspective of her crawling along the walls like a spider monkey, it was creepy as fuck.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the visuals, another key factor that I feel increased the aesthetic appeal of this anime was the music and how the directors used it. I'm not going to talk about the opening and ending themes yet, since I'll probably do those in a separate video. Instead, I'm going to talk about how this anime used music during its scenes to enhance the emotions that the director wanted you to feel.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is filled to the brim with a number of interesting instrumental songs. Going back to the episode where Subaru fights Elsa, the episode starts off with an almost off-time tune that enhances the increases the tension between Emilia, Subaru, Rom, and Felt when they're having a stand off. As the stand off continues, more instruments join the music to thicken that feeling of the scene reaching a potentially fatal conclusion. However, the tension soon fades when Subaru spots the flower on Emilia's clothing, which was given to her by the girl they had rescued together in a previous timeline. The music fades at just the right time. A mere instant after the music dies, Subaru spots Elsa getting ready to attack Emilia.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example of how this anime used music was during the more psychologically damaging moments. I feel like the greatest example is in episode 18. Subaru wakes up after barely surviving against the White Wale. The music that's playing is an electric piano, and the tune has a melancholy feel, which contrasts with Ram's casual demeanor. However, this only serves to enhance Subaru's emotional distress, which you can see in his face. At one point, the instruments shift to what I believe is a violin orchestra, though don't quote me on that. At this point, Subaru tells Ram that Rem is dead and wallows in his own helplessness. At that moment, Ram asks Subaru, \u201cWho is Rem.\u201d The abrupt ceasing of music that happens here is almost jarring, and it really gives you this feeling where you can't help but wonder what's going on. This is especially true because the music starts a few seconds after this question, but the tone is different, darker, and it accompanies Subaru's increasingly desperate voice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNatsuki Subaru -The Hero You Never Asked For-\\n\\n\r\nNatsuki Subaru is the titular character of RE:Zero Starting Life in Another World, and he's one of those character who's very existence has sparked much debate within the anime community. Some people love him, claiming that he's realistic, while others hate him, perhaps for that very same reason.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think there's any denying that Natsuki Subaru is a great character. The fact that he sparks so much debate among fans proves that. But what makes him work as a character that gets so much attention? Why does he, out of all the tracksuit wearing Otaku who've been sent to another world, receive such high praise and loathing in equal amounts?\\n\\n\r\nTaking a look at the very start of the series, we immediately get a feel for what kind of person Subaru is. We watch him as he lazily, slothfully, reads a manga at a convenience store. We watch as his empty eyes flicker across the page and he mumbles to himself. Taking a look at him here, in his natural element, I feel like we have a clear view of Natsuki Subaru and what kind of person he is. What stood out the most to me during this sequence was how empty he seems. It's not the same emptiness as most light novel protagonists, who are no more than blank slates that are used as self-insert characters. He feels more like a soul who simply has nothing going for him, which is the general outlook that most Japanese people have of Otakus.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Subaru is suddenly transported to another world, he instantly recognizes what happened. Rather than panic, as would be the natural response of most people, Subaru seems excited. This is shown in his cringe worthy dialogue and over the top actions. He's not freaked out in the least. In fact, he seems to think of this as his chance to shine as \u201cthe main protagonist.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI've heard a lot of debate on the subject of Subaru's reaction, or lack there of, as some people have described it. Some people feel like Subaru's reaction was unrealistic because he didn't panic enough. However, I actually think Subaru's reaction is exactly what we should expect from someone like him. While it's not shown, from his general appearance, demeanor, and attitude, it's easy to see that Subaru is the kind of person who stayed at home watching anime and playing video games all day, only going out when he needed to buy something.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, Subaru is the by-product of the media that he's consumed. What's more, there are numerous isekai anime out there, which I feel lends credence to Subaru's reaction to his new predicament. He's consumed so much of this media where regular Otaku's are sent to another world that not only does he realize what's happened, but he's become disillusioned enough to believe that being sent to another world somehow makes him special, that he's become one of the chosen few, and that he was sent here for a reason, and that this reason is because he's going to be the hero of this world. What makes his actions more believable is how Otaku view themselves.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone wants to be special. However, I feel like Otakus take this to another level. This is why so many anime that pander to Otakus feature tropes like overpowered main characters and harems. They're designed to empower and glorify Otaku culture.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Subaru different is that his existence doesn't glorify Otaku culture. Everything this guy does throughout the series is cringe worthy. Near the beginning, he spouts atrocious and arrogant lines that made me want to slam my face into a wall, because a facepalm wouldn't be enough to deal with the cringiness. In some ways, in many ways, Natsuki Subaru is the exact opposite of a traditional light novel protagonist. Instead of glorifying Otaku culture, he does the opposite by showing all of the worst traits that are often associated with Otaku. It's sort of like staring into a mirror and only seeing the things about yourself that you hate the most.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how cringe-inducing Subaru is, he does have some outstanding qualities, such as his desire and determination to help Emilia during the first arc. Even though his lines still made me facepalm, I really admired his determination and willingness to help, even though it was obvious that he was still afraid of Elsa. The fact that, in the end, he not only succeeded but also saved Emilia's life when Elsa tried to kill her with a surprise attack, has a much greater impact because it's something that I honestly didn't think he could do, unlike most light novel protagonists who only struggle when the plot demands it.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the next arc, we see more of Subaru and his ridiculously meta dialogue and poorly veiled anime references. By this point, I actually felt like his dialogue was kind of charming. I thought his attempts at wooing Emilia, who doesn't even seem to realize that Subaru is completely crushing on her, were cute. It helps that he and Puck got along great. Puck's added cuteness does an amazing job of softening Subaru's thuggish appearance and terrible lines.\\n\\n\r\nI almost feel like this arc served as a method of buffing Subaru's character up while also slowly breaking him down. In the beginning, Subaru works really hard to be useful and spends a lot of time with Emilia, even convincing her to go on a date with him. Then he dies. He goes to sleep and wakes up the next morning in the bed that he first woke up in, a bed that he hadn't slept in since the beginning of the arc, and the scars on his hands, which he gained from cutting himself while learning to cook, are all gone.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru's emotional paradigm slowly shifts from light hearted to darker. At first he tries to do everything over again, going under the assumption that he can figure out what killed him if he retraces his steps. This doesn't actually help, though. On the fifth day, the day where he was killed last time, Subaru decides to stay up all night and ends up suffering instead of just dying in his sleep. First, he's hit by some kind of strange nausea, which we later learn was caused by a curse. Then, when he leaves his room to seek help, he is brutally attacked and murdered by someone, though he never saw who.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this, Subaru decides to confront his attacker. This is the point where Subaru breaks. When he's killed and his life resets from his previous \u201csave point\u201d, Subaru decides that he doesn't want to be near anyone. He withdraws into himself and doesn't bother with all of the actions he took previously. He shuts himself away, convincing Beatrice to protect him. As a result of his actions, Rem is killed in his place, which makes Subaru realize that the person who cursed him wasn't Rem or Ram. Of course, at this stage, none of that matters because Subaru already irreversibly screwed up this time line.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru undergoes another shift during this episode. At the end, he kills himself to reset time by willingly leaping off a cliff. I'm not sure if this is stupidity or what, but since he has his Return by Death ability, I can't argue with the results. Subaru returns back to his previous save point and decides that the first thing he needs to do is win the trust of his new companions. We then watch a desperate Subaru as he struggles to earn Rem and Ram's trust. I can practically feel his desperation during this time. The way he ramped up his cringe-y Otakuness in a vain effort to endear himself to them was so well-done. It contrasted with the \u201cthought speaking\u201d that we hear the longer this went on. It wasn't until Emilia, who was already pretty worried when she sees how he's acting, allows him to release all of his pent up frustration and sorrow.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the turning point in the arc, because the next few episodes are basically Subaru overcoming all of the obstacles that were presented to him. Thanks to Emilia, he earned Rem's trust, which enables him to find out what had cursed him. Then he earns Rem's affection by saving her in the last arc of this season.\\n\\n\r\nAll's well that ends well, right?\\n\\n\r\nWrong.\\n\\n\r\nIn most anime, this would be the point where Subaru becomes the hero that everyone wishes they could be. Instead, Subaru takes a different turn, a more realistic turn. He becomes arrogant. It's no surprise. After facing off against such hardships, overcoming such hurdles, any normal person would become drunk off their own sense of self-importance. In some ways, this arrogance is deserved. However, Subaru shows us the worst and ugliest side of humanity's arrogance during the next arc, and it's here where I feel Re:Zero differentiates itself from other anime of the isekai genre.\\n\\n\r\nThis arc introduces a new problem to the anime. We've already learned from Roswaal that Emilia is one of several candidates who are next in line for the throne. Subaru travels with Emilia under the pretense of thanking the people who helped him when he first arrived in Lugnica and having his magic gate, which he damaged during his fight with the Mabeast, healed.\\n\\n\r\nWe can see at the beginning how Subaru's arrogance has gotten the better of him when Julius kisses Emilia on the hand and he responds with jealousy. However, it's not until Subaru muscles his way into the meeting where all of the king candidates are that we can see how low he's fallen. This fact is further emphasized when he accepts Julius challenge and gets his ass handed to him, and now comes the clincher. After being beaten by Julius, he is confronted by Emilia. Before this, he had actually made several promises to Emilia: He would not do anything reckless and he would wait at the inn with Rem. When Emilia asks Subaru why he decided to fight Julius, his answer is that he did it all for her, because she saved him and he's repaying her.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem here is that Emilia doesn't remember saving him. The timeline in which Emilia rescued Subaru is already gone. The only one who remembers what happened is Subaru. Frustrated, drowning in self-importance and arrogance, Subaru goes off on Emilia, claiming that he's done so much for her, that she should be more grateful, that she should be indebted to him. Emilia agrees that she owes him a lot and decides to end things here.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we see after this is Subaru going through a downward spiral of denial and despair. Each episode becomes more and more hopeless as the tragedies that he faces escalates. Halfway through this arc, Subaru's mind even breaks and he becomes a vegetable. And just when you thought Subaru could not get any lower, he surprises you by showing us just how scumy he can be. I feel like this arc is showing us how low humans can become when they're back is against the wall. All of Subaru's faults are thrown into his face by the king candidates who he tries to make help him. It isn't until episode 17, when Subaru confronts Emilia after miraculously making it to the Roswaal estate, that he realizes just how little he can do, and it's not until episode 18, when he is killed by Pack after killing Emilia, that he realizes how little everyone else expects out of him.\\n\\n\r\nAfter being killed by Pack, Subaru is forced to confront all of the things that he ignored: his weakness, his inability to do anything, the fact that no one expected anything from him, and his own self-loating. I feel like this episode represents both the lowest and highest points of Subaru's evolution here. After having failed numerous times to become the main hero that he feels his owed to him in this world, he tries to convince Rem to run away with him. What makes this point so low is because Subaru doesn't love Rem. He loves Emilia. However, he's trying to convince Rem, a girl he doesn't love, to runaway with him as a consolation prize. Rem realizes this, of course, which is why she convinces him not to run away, but I'll get to that when I talk about Rem in another video.\\n\\n\r\nI've mentioned this before, but in a lot of ways, Subaru is the kind of otaku/nerd that many of us don't want to be. Having watched many light novel anime in my time, I wasn't used to seeing a character like Subaru, who isn't the glorified otaku protagonist that's special from episode 1. And as much as I loved seeing Subaru when he actually succeeds when everyone expected him to fail, I loved seeing him when he realized that he was nothing even more. In some ways, I feel like Subaru is less of a protagonist and more like an non playable character from a video game who suddenly became the main protagonist. He oftentimes finds himself in over his head, but he pushes through and succeeds even while he's annoying the crap out of everyone around him with his genre-savvy awareness and self-importance. It's these massive flaws mixed in with the few good traits that shine through that make Subaru one of the best and worst characters that I've ever seen. He is, in many ways, the hero that you never asked for.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEmilia -Silver-haired Half-elf Heroines-\\n\\n\r\nEmilia is the main heroine and love interest of Natsuki Subaru, and I don't think anyone can deny her visual appeal. From her silver hair and purple eyes, to her outstanding dress, Emilia stands out among heroines in terms of how aesthetically pleasing she is. But beneath the surface of her pretty face and pointy ears lies the real reason she's the main heroine of Re:Zero.\\n\\n\r\nTrue to her role as the main heroine, Emilia embodies many of the traits that a lot of people find appealing. She's kind to everyone she meets, she goes out of her way to help people even when doing so wouldn't benefit her, and she has a forgiving attitude that makes her extremely likable. She's also socially awkward, has trouble expressing her feelings, and is incredibly naive, which makes her really cute. I feel like her very concept was made to epitomize the traits that people consider to be \u201cmain heroine\u201d traits. In some ways, I actually feel like Emilia is more of a main character than Subaru, despite how this anime is about Subaru.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like you all to imagine what this world would be like if Subaru never showed up. If no otaku from another world suddenly appeared in Lugnica, what do you think this anime would be about? Chances are it would be about Emilia. The reason is because of the lofty goals, position, and expectations that have been placed on her within the series. We learn from Roswaal in episode 5 that Emilia is one of several candidates for the throne of Lugnica. During the time when Subaru is learning how to be a good servant, we're given occasional glimpses of what Emilia is doing. The times when we see her sitting behind a desk, writing on something or reading something, are placed in here to reveal that she's learning how to become a proper ruler. If Subaru had never entered the picture, I'm positive that this story would have been about Emilia as she tries to ascend the throne.\\n\\n\r\nBut while this is certainly a lofty goal worthy of a main character, it's not everything that makes Emilia who she is, or what makes her shine despite getting so little screen time. Throughout the series we're given tiny glimpse of her personality. Whenever she's with Subaru and he's acting goofy, Emilia shows us a socially awkward side of her that, at first glance, seems like nothing more than a cute quirk. It isn't until much later that we learn that her inability to sometimes comprehend others or take their words at face value is because of a much darker reason.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the scenes I would like to highlight for you all is just before Subaru dies for the first time after coming to Roswaal's mansion. Subaru is telling Emilia about all the fun things he's been doing, and how he went into the village that day and had to deal with all the kids and a dog biting him. He asks Emilia if she wants to go with him, but Emilia turns her head. She states that \u201cit's not that she doesn't want to go with him, but that she might cause trouble.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis sort of scene continues throughout this arc. It doesn't seem like much at first. However, we were previously given a hint as to why she's so reticent to travel into the village with Subaru. It's at the end of part 2 episode 1 and the beginning of episode 2. In part 1 of the first episode, Emilia tells Subaru that her name is Satella, so naturally, Subaru calls her that when he catches up to her at the end of part 2. However, the time line from before has vanished, and so Emilia never gave him that name. He's shocked when she gets angry, but then she tells him not to call her by the name of the \u201cjealous witch\u201d. We learn later on that the \u201cwitch\u201d is referring to a woman named Satella, who is one of the most feared and hated people in Lugnica's history. In episode 4, when Emilia confronts Subaru, Felt, and Rom, Felt is startled when she learns that Emilia is a half-elf. Her words in that episode point to another fact: Emilia looks exactly like Satella.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that's popular among shounen anime, it's that we love to see our heroes as the \u201cunderdog\u201d. There's nothing greater than watching someone who is supposed to be weaker suddenly triumph. There's a reason anime like Naruto, and more recently, My Hero Academy, are so popular. Oddly enough, Emilia embodies this shounen trait more than Subaru does. For her entire life, she's had to live with the hatred that comes from being not only a half elf, but someone who resembles the most hated person in history. When looking at her during the meeting where they introduce the king candidates, we can see that she's the underdog. No one wants her to win. In fact, I'm pretty sure that many of these people would be happier if she dropped dead.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what makes her such an appealing main heroine. While Emilia is never given a whole lot of screen time, the bit of screen time that she's given is irreplaceable and does an excellent job of slowly revealing more about her and the hardships she has to face.\\n\\n\r\nI think it's because she's had to constantly deal with the hatred of others that she comes to appreciate Subaru, and it is also what ultimately helped drive a wedge between them. During the last scene of episode 13, when Subaru tries to justify how he broke his promise to her, Emilia tells him that she thought he was going to be different, that he would treat her the same way he treats everyone else. I could almost feel Emilia's heart shattering with those words. When someone has been scorned their whole life, the only thing they want is to be treated the same as everyone else, especially if the circumstances for that scorn are beyond their control. However, it's this moment that reveals something else about Emilia's character.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout this entire moment, I feel like everything Emilia did was for Subaru's sake instead of her own. Subaru kept pushing himself because of her, kept getting injured because of her. In the end, she decided that it would be better if she cut ties with him. If they were no longer associated with each other, then maybe Subaru would stop hurting himself for her sake. Of course, it's not as if Emilia is perfect. I'm sure that a part of her reason for pushing Subaru away was for her own sake. It's not easy seeing someone push themselves so hard for you when you can't understand why. At the same time, I feel like Emilia's kindness is almost at the level of a martyr, which partly caused by the fact that Emilia doesn't believe she deserves to be happy.\\n\\n\r\nThese two facts, the fact that Emilia is more concerned about Subaru than herself, and the fact that she doesn't believe she deserves happiness, are expanded upon later on. When Subaru returns to the Roswaal estate and tries to convince Emilia to leave with him, she doesn't understand and therefore won't go with him. Subaru then goes off on a rant. When he finishes, rather than getting upset, Emilia asks \u201cWhy are you crying, as if you're in such pain?\u201d This tells me that she realizes Subaru is suffering, even if she doesn't understand why. Rather than just assuming that he was yelling at her, she recognizes that the person he was yelling at was, in reality, himself. That he was telling himself that nothing he did would make a difference. What makes this moment so impactful is how, even though Emilia is stressed from being a kind candidate, she still shows concern for Subaru.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few things I didn't like about this series was how little screen time Emilia received. I would've liked to see more of what she was doing while Subaru was being traumatized and suffering. That said, the few glimpses we're given are enough for me to confirm that she's also been suffering in her own way. During the time where Subaru is gone, Emilia spends her days alone in the mansion or trying to convince the villagers that it's not safe and they should come up to her mansion where they will be protected. The villages scorn and refusal to listen, combined with the fact that Subaru is no longer there to keep her company, leaves Emilia depressed. For those of you who've watched the closing theme song of the second half, you'll see what I'm talking about. During the closing theme, we're shown a cartoonish version of what Emilia's life was like after cutting ties with Subaru. Later on, we're also given flashbacks that show the villagers turning her away when she tries to rescue them.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there is also the fact that everytime Subaru came to the mansion during episodes 14, 15, and 16, Emilia has been killed by a cult that wants her dead. Even if we didn't see her death, it's easy to realize that she likely suffered a great deal before dying.\\n\\n\r\nThe final point I'd like to make in this segment is how Emilia is a badass. We don't see this very often because she only fights twice, once against Elsa and once more when the Witch's Cult attacks, but she's actually pretty freaking strong. Sure, she's got Pack on her side, but Puck actually didn't do much outside of the beginning fights with Elsa, and he only gave Emilia a little bit of aid when she fought against one of Betelguease's fingers.\\n\\n\r\nWhether you like Emilia or not, I don't think there are many people who will deny that she has all the makings of a main character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRem -The Maid Every Man Wants-\\n\\n\r\nOne of the greatest surprises in Re:Zero, for me at least, was the sudden popularity with Rem. Granted, it's not hard to understand why she became so popular, but when she was first introduced, Rem didn't have much of a presence. In fact, Ram had a lot more screen time than Rem did. It wasn't even until episode 7, where we learn that Rem was the mysterious person who killed Subaru in a previous episode, that she really rises to prominence.\\n\\n\r\nTo see why Rem is so popular, I believe the first thing we need to look at is just what Rem is. She's a maid. This might not seem like a good reason, but maids have become an exceedingly popular aspect of otaku culture, not just in Japan, but in the US as well. Maid cafes started to really explode in Japan during the early 2000s, and since then, the appeal of maids has gotten to the point where there are now several maid cafes in the United States.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes maids such a huge hit among fans depends on who it is. For women, I believe it's the cute outfit. Let's face it, the frills and fluff on a maid uniform is pretty darn adorable. There's a reason maid's symbolize Japan's love for moe. For the man, it's because maid's represent the ideal woman. They're supportive, they're loyal, and they're subservient. A maid basically lives for her master or mistress, and after Subaru saves her life in episode 11, Rem becomes what many men consider to be the ideal maid.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that must be considered is how much we learned about Rem during the last half of the second arc. Rem has a tragic backstory that appeals to people. It pulls at their heart strings and makes you want to root for her. I think the fact that she was originally seen as the lesser of the two sisters made her feel a bit more flawed. She wasn't this perfect maid right from the start, she didn't have this impeccable talent. She cultivated it after her village was burned down and her sister lost her horn.\\n\\n\r\nIn some ways, Rem becoming such a perfect maid was done in repentance for what happened to her sister. She believes it's her fault that Ram lost her horn and therefore her powers. To make up for this, she has strive to become as perfect as possible. I don't know if I could call this a form of self-punishment, but I can say that she's definitely beating herself up over this.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this actually brings up another point of appeal for Rem. She's a demon, and what's better than a cute demon maid who kicks ass? Rem not only has the maid appeal that everyone loves for one reason or another, but she's also really strong. Just watching as she demolished those mabeasts during episodes 10 and 11 was incredible. Seriously. What's not to like about a maid who can toss around a spiked ball and chain like it was a chew toy?\\n\\n\r\nBeyond her general appeal, I feel what really made her so loved was how much screen time she got. Going through the anime after Subaru rescues her, it's easy to see that Rem is in almost every scene that Subaru is in. You always see her. Even when she's not the focal point of that particular scene, she's there in the background, as though her role was the silently support Subaru. This point about her supporting Subaru is also made clear during the many scenes in which Rem expresses her belief that Subaru is special. During the time when Subaru's mind had broken after seeing the villagers near the Roswaal manner slaughtered, Crusch asked Rem why she would give her life for a man like Subaru, and Rem's answer was \u201cBecause he is special.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's probably the greatest appeal to Rem. At a time where Subaru was sinking into despair, Rem was the one holding him up. People like it when they have others support them. It's a part of human nature. Therefore, it's only natural that people would flock to Rem, who's willing to support Subaru regardless of the personal cost to herself. Her devotion towards Subaru is second to none. She literally gives her life for him several times throughout this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe most stunning example of Rem's devotion is shown during the same seen that probably caused a number of viewers to drop the series. It's during the time when Subaru tries to convince Rem to run away with him. Rem looks really happy that he would ask her this, but at the same time, she at the same time, I feel like she knows that Subaru wouldn't be happy because he's abandoning what made him seem so strong to her in the first place. Ultimately, it was her support that made him choose to stick around. Of course, it was Subaru's statement about loving Emilia that had many US Rem fans up in arms, but I'm not going to get into that.\\n\\n\r\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise. Rem's devotion has made her number 1 in the hearts of many\u2014even if she still isn't number 1 in Subaru's heart.",

            "content": "What would you do, if one day as you're leading your normal average life and out of the blue you end up in a Fantasy realm? This is the Story that revolves around Natsuki Subaru who mysteriously drops into a fantasy world and gains this ability where he can rewind time and go back to a saved point in his life everytime he dies, he befriends Emilia, a half elf who is hated for her witch like characteristics and eventually falls in love with her. The story focuses on Subaru as he tries to overcome the overwhelming obstacles he must face in order to undothe fatal incidents that occur along the way, to save and be acknowledged by the one he loves. \\n\r\nCan he adapt to his new environment? Can he handle the trauma of repeatedly dying again and again? and even if he does, will his ability be enough to turn things around?\\n\r\nRe:Zero is a fantastic adventure fantasy thriller that got me hooked right from episode 0, you don't know what the fuck is going on but you watch it anyway cause it's interesting, every episode is just so unpredictable and mind blowing that even if you find a huge flaw, it really wouldn't ruin your enjoyment. The main highlight of this show are it's dark elements, sometimes it's just so brutal and fucked up the adrenaline rush is just...gawd.\\n\r\nCharacter development is really good too, especially the MC, the writer does not hold back against him. he is hit hard, again and again, which slowly, harsh and brutally develops him throughout the series. \\n\r\nThe art and animation is really good, as expected from white fox studios. the music is some next level shit tho, I can't describe how well it goes with scenes, it's brilliant direction i suppose. There are also these 2 second voice soundtracks in between that deserve a mention. that are so creepy and freak me out every fucking time, because i always watch this around midnight, I probably get more freaked out than i should lol but nonetheless it fits the scene so perfectly, giving you the chills. OPs and EDs are very good too, the 2nd ED being one of my most favorites this year.\\n\r\nAlthough this show is much praiseworthy, it does not come without it's flaws. sometimes it's just annoying and turns into a big cringefest, and although it tries to be original, which it does for the most part. it can sometimes come off as clich\u00e9. dropping into a fantasy world, recurring time loop and there are small things here and there that you probably would have seen before. but there is one major thing i really have to criticize about the writing, that is Subaru's lack of backstory. he just falls into fantasy realm and doesn't give a two shit flying fuck about where he came from. Don't you have anyone back home? anyone who cares for you back there at all? idk if the writers would address this in the future but i can only judge so far from what's there. \\n\r\nBut anyway, Re:Zero for what it is, it's an absolute must watch. A series I highly recommend for it's unpredictability and a thrilling experience like no other! with that being said, i would give my final rating-\\n\r\n8.75/10",

It's highlight how a person summoned to another world can get alive again on death , the main character is developed in such a way that every one can connect to him easily and feels that they have done the same thing If they face the same situation which Subaru our hero faces .. The mystery in the anime is yet to be unfold but yeah it's worth watching .. It makes you to cry  , laugh , feel agony, pain etc while watching it.\r\nIt's sometime annoying that we don't get toknow how our hero was summoned to the other world even after the whole season  , and for that wet have to wait for the second season to know all the details and backgrounds. But overall I am deeply touched by the REM character the girl who is so lovely that I love her character totally",

            "content": "Alright, so I've been waiting on doing a Re:Zero review for a while now.  First I'm gonna respond to the haters.\r\n1- Subaru doesn't question why he's in a fantasy world, why?  Simply because, he doesn't give a fuck.  He has already determined that this world is better than his shit life.  And that's a pretty easy determination to make.  Magic?  Markets?  Kingdoms?  Knights?  The fact that he was ACCEPTED into a mansion?  What's not to like?\r\n2- Ram/Rem are there for fanservice, why?  Because they're maids at a fucking mansion, protecting their Queen-hopeful.  Ifthey were all dudes people would be like, where are the maids?  Why is everyone a guy in a circle-jerk over this girl who many people do not want to become Queen?  It's actually totally unrealistic to say that there wouldn't be female characters in a mansion, doing duties.  They also have plenty of backstory, explaining that they were shunned for being demons with only one horn, so they identify with the hated half-elf queen hopeful.  \\n\\n\r\n3- The mansion-head is a metrosexual.  The fuck?  How often have you looked into fantasy/medieval scenarios and not seen someone who's had a flamboyant personality?  The fact you can't accept it doesn't mean these people aren't real.  It's actually cool that he's a good guy, and is pretty restrained.  They also play out the knighthood pretty well, as not better, but a higher born personality in society.  No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\n4- It's an SAO-ripoff?  Absolutely not.  People seriously shit a brick because he's gone off to a fantasy world and enjoys it.  SAO was not the first media to do this.  I actually got Final Fantasy vibes from this which is a decade ahead of SAO.  Just because if you kids went off to a medieval world and hated it doesn't mean everyone has to stoop to your levels of cowardice.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story is pretty well fleshed out in its scenarios.  They've got a competition by the dragon to become queen, different races, different statures in society, and a character that makes sense to not be powerful.  He has no previous knight training, is not rich or a merchant, so is initially looked down upon.  However he does hold a key to helping out people that are trained, as well as quite a bit of wit upon him for organizing attack.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art quality is good, and fantasy scenarios are well fleshed out.  Animation quality is well also(motion).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThere are no standout theme songs, but the melodies are pretty good and fit the story well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThere are all sorts of great characters for a medieval/fantasy story.  The knighthood is well explained/realistic, as well as the competition for queen.  Street rats are existant, and there are plenty of different races.  Ram/Rem are awesome and have a ton of backstory.  Yes, these are good characters for maids you dolts.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThere's plenty of character development, a refreshing take on a main character, who does more planning than fighting, and a great fantasy/medieval world you'd probably not want to leave.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis anime does many things well, but I'd need to see a bit of training on Subaru's side, as well as a bit of a quicker pace to give this a 10.",

            "content": "Watching Re:Zero was like a rollercoaster ride for me. At times, it made me laugh. At times, it made me cry. At times, it left me shocked and at times, the show made my brain tremble but the show was still a really fun and enjoyable ride from start till the end. The show is, by no means, a flawless show but I'll explain somewhere down below why I gave this show a score of 10. (9.7, to be more specific, but who cares)\r\n(My review will contain some SPOILERS) \r\n[Story]: (8/10)\r\nWhen this anime was announced during the end of Winter of 2016, I had noexpectations in this series whatsoever. I thought that Re:Zero was going to be another generic harem light novel adaptation. I still decided to give this series a shot though because why not? Episode 1A was just your typical \"MC has now been transported into the fantasy world and that's where his harem adventure begins\" crap. Oh, how wrong I was. Episode 1B completely surprised the shit out of me and it's the episode that got my complete attention. Although, it wasn't until Episode 2 or 3 where I got completely hooked with the show. This series turned out to be the opposite of what I had expected. Basically, Re:Zero is like a mixture of KonoSuba and ERASED but injected with tons of suffering and despair\\n\\n\r\nThe show's main character \"Subaru\" has this special ability called \"Return to Death\". The ability does what you expect it to do. Once Subaru dies, he gets revived in a designated checkpoint. Like a RPG, if you will. I'm sure you're going to ask questions like \"Where's the tension if he gets revived anyways?\" or \"Who cares if he dies? He's going to be revived anyways\". Oho, for the most part, you're wrong. The ability may look like a deus-ex machina for Subaru but trust me, it's not. The ability is more like a useful ability for Subaru's character growth but at the same time, it's like a cursed ability for him. A few months ago, when CR was advertising Re:Zero, they used a quote which I thought was really clever. It says: \\n\\n\r\n\"Dying over and over is a fate worse than death\". \\n\r\nI couldn't agree more. Dying is basically an easy way out and not being able to take the easy way out and being forced to relive the terrible situation that you just faced will leave you a mental scar. Just thinking of death alone will make, even the strongest person, to break down. That's why I said it's like a cursed ability for him. Subaru, has the advantage, of going back into a designated checkpoint and yet, he avoids using the ability as much as possible because the psychological and physical pain that comes with death is overbearing for him. We see that the more Subaru dies, the more mentally fucked up he gets. I really love how Subaru's way of thinking is realistic. Not something that I usually get in an anime but I welcome it. Anyways, Subaru's mental breakdown will be evident in the 2nd and 3rd Arc of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the ability more complicated for him is the fact that he can't tell anyone about his ability. If he tries then Subaru suffers the consequences. When he dies and resets to a new timeline, he can only rely on himself to use his knowledge that he gained from the previous timeline into the new timeline to solve whatever is going on. Plus, he has to repeat almost everything that he did in the previous timeline. Not something that I'd want to go through after all the hard work that I did. This is the kind of the character growth that I'm talking about which was the aspect that I loved about Re:Zero. He doesn't physically get strong but mentally, he does. By using his profound knowledge to deal with the situation. Though, this doesn't work all the time for him but that's all I'll have to say.   \\n\\n\r\nThe show has 3 arcs. The 1st arc is the \"A Day in the Capital\" arc. It's basically an introduction arc and this arc proves us that Re:Zero is not what we think it is when we first watched the show. \\n\r\nThe 2nd arc is the \"Mansion\" arc. The 2nd arc lasted a lot longer than the 1st arc. At first, I thought it was being dragged out but I couldn't be more wrong. This arc is now starting to set-up the story and introduces us to a bunch of characters like the two cute maids, a loli and the head of the mansion. This arc is also where the deconstruction of a LN genre begins. For example, those two maids aren't just a couple of simple maids and there's actually more to them than just \"simple maids\". Usually, the maids in the LN anime adaptation that I've watched are just a bunch of useless nobodies who's just in there for fanservice but in here, they're not. It actually felt like they were part of the show and actually contributed to the show's progression. My opinions on this arc are very slow story progression but amazing character development for several characters. The story only progressed for like a week but this arc lasted for 8 episodes. I was watching this show weekly so I had to watch this arc for 8 weeks. I'm actually not going to complain much about the story progression because the character development is phenomenal. We see Rem's character development, Ram's character, Subaru's character development and etc. Man, the amount of time that they spent developing these characters is shocking and brilliant at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nThe 3rd arc is the \"Truth of Zero\" arc. This arc is, by far, the longest arc in the series (not counting the future arcs) which spanned for 13 episodes. Before the 3rd arc started, several Re:Zero LN/WN readers have warned anime-only viewers (which also includes me) that the 3rd arc's tone will be more darker than the previous arcs and Subaru will suffer more than he did in the previous arcs. They said that this arc will be unbearable for some and not everyone will be able to handle this arc. At first, I took their words with a grain of salt because I was like \"How darker could this series possibly get? If I can handle Arc 2, then I sure as hell can handle Arc 3\". Oh, how wrong I was. If I were to personally summarize my feelings for this arc, I would have to say, it was like a rollercoaster ride. In other words, my review opener relates heavily on what I felt about the 3rd arc. While the story progression of this arc was, yet again, very slow and didn't really focus that much on the Elections right after the fight occurred between Emilia and Subaru, the character development in this arc was god-tier amazing. Words just can't express how amazing and how much I love the character development in Arc 3. Just watching Subaru's character growth and Rem's character development in this arc was unbelievable and just.....Gah!, Amazing! In my years of watching other mediums and also anime, this comes out on the Top 3. Even rivaling one of my favourite TV shows of all time, Game of Thrones. I just love how much of a human Subaru is. If you're going to try and argue with me on this then please bring a Psychology student along with you because I'm not going to waste my time arguing with someone who doesn't understand complex human emotions. Otherwise, just don't bother. \\n\\n\r\nNow that I'm done talking about all of the arcs, I can finally talk about the other aspects of the show. For starters, the pacing. The pacing of the show was decent. It wasn't great but I don't think it was bad either. The show, most notably on the start of Arc 3, sometimes suffers from poor pacing by rushing things through. I really don't mind the slow pacing of the show because I'm the kind of person who prefers slow pacing but not those very slow paced show. Secondly, plot holes. If you look at Re:Zero's Web Novel, the story is fucking ginormous. The WN is at the 6th arc and it's only about halfway through. Since the anime only adapted the first 3 arcs, it's no surprise that the show would contain plot holes. The source material eventually fills the plot holes but I just can ignore the anime's plot holes. Plot holes like \"How Subaru was transported into the fantasy world?\", \"Who the hell is Satella and what does she want with him?\" and etc.  \\n\\n\r\nThirdly, the dramatic aspect of the show was very well-done. There are some melodramatic scenes in the anime but it's only a few and the melodrama was bearable. For the most part, Re:Zero has just the right amount of drama, whether it's the confession scene between Rem and Subaru in Ep.18 or Subaru using Emilia as his lap pillow and just letting all his emotions out.  They worked because I actually feel for the characters, especially Subaru and all the shit that he has gone through. For example, when Subaru let all his emotions out while using Emilia's lap as a pillow, I knew what he felt. He was doing everything in his power to solve the mystery that was plaguing him in the mansion but he realized it was too hard for him. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the show has flaws, whether that may be minor or major flaws (plot holes, lack of character development for some characters and etc.), I still gave this show a score of 10. I even gave Madoka Magica Movie 3: Rebellion a score of 10 despite its flaws and it's the same case for Re:Zero. Phenomenal Character Development, Mostly-Well Done Dramatic Scenes, ,Realistic and Flawed Main Protagonist, and scenes from Ep. 8, 11, 15, 23 and especially Episode 18 are the leading factors that made me decide to give this show a score of 10. In fact, if I were to rate the 18th Episode alone, I would immediately give it a 10/10, no debates. It was an episode that mostly consisted of dialogue scenes but it was just as fucking great as the Monogatari Series' dialogue scenes. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI still think Steins;Gate (Studio White Fox) is the studio's best work in terms of art and visuals but White Fox still managed to get the job well done in terms of Animation. The visuals are amazing. They managed to create a world with a fantasy-feel to it. The character designs looks good, in my opinion, but it looks like your typical light novel harem fantasy anime adaptations. There's cute girls, maids, traps and etc. Not like I have any problem with it. The character expressions though. They are really outstanding, especially Subaru's expression in the 3rd Arc. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was mostly good but when it came to the fighting scenes, I think that's where White Fox suffered. The fighting scenes in the 1st Arc and some parts of the 2nd Arc looked good but as the show progressed, the animation quality kind-of dipped. The fighting scenes in the 3rd Arc felt so-and-so. Especially the battle with the Flying Whale and The Final battle with Betelgeuse. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nRe:Zero has a wide variety of soundtracks that are exceptionally well-done. From OSTs that sounds like something that you'd hear when you're playing a RPG to OSTs that sounds batshit scary (I.e, OST that plays when Subaru time-resets or when Satella \"shows\" up), it was unbelievably good. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"Redo\" by Konomi Suzuki and \"Paradisus-Paradoxum\" by MYTH & ROID. The 1st OP sounded decent and the only thing that stood out to me was how the OP gave me a Steins;Gate vibe and a clever start and ending point that made it look like the OP was literally in a loop. The 2nd OP is where its at though. The tone and the atmosphere of the song was like a message from White Fox telling us that \"Playtime is over\". Also, because of this song, MYTH and ROID is/are now one of my favourite Japanese bands of all-time. They sounded really great. \\n\r\nThe ED theme songs are  \"STYX HELIX\" by MYTH & ROID and \"Stay Alive\" by Emilia's VA. MYTH and ROID just did an outstanding job with the 1st ED. Everything about the song sounds really, really great. The 2nd ED, on the other hand, felt a bit underwhelming, compared to the badass 1st ED, but it was still a good song and I pretty much love how the 2nd ED is basically a story about Emilia's life after the fight occurred between her and Subaru. It's like they didn't want to give her screentime in the 3rd Arc so they just told a \"how she's doing\" story in the form of a song. \\n\\n\r\nI don't usually review Japanese voice actors because I'm not Japanese and they all sound the same to me anyways but I really want to talk about the brilliance of voice acting in Re:Zero. The voice actors in this show did a hell of a great job when it comes to voice acting. Especially Subaru, Rem, Betelguese and his fingers (not literally his fingers :/). In all honestly, they all deserve a pay raise. They all did an outstanding job expressing the characters emotions. Subaru's VA Yuusuke Kobayashi did a great job expressing Subaru's suffering, despair, fear, and his acts of greed and selfishness. Rem's VA Inori Minase did a great job expressing Rem's emotions and her loyal personality. At first,  I couldn't believe that Rem's VA was the same VA as Chino from a slice of life series that was also created by White Fox. Betelgeuse's VA Yoshitsugu Matsuoka did a great job expressing Betelgeuse's over-the-top insanity. He made it really convincing that Betelgeuse's insanity was on a whole another level.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe characters....The characters and their character development are the REASON why I'm giving this show a score of 10. Like I said earlier in my reviews, the show may have flaws but because of the outstanding and phenomenal Character Development, I just decided to give this show a 10. So why do I love these characters?...Let's find out. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have Subaru Natsuki. An 18 year-old NEET who suddenly got transported into a fantasy world and has an ability called \"Return by Death\". Subaru is an unusual MC. He's not like one of those typical shounen protagonist who is dense, has a harem and has an ass-pull powers that makes said typical shounen protagonist so overpowered. He has an ability, sure, but his ability is like a gift and curse at the same time.  He tries not to use his ability too much because of the physical and psychological pain that comes along with dying. What's more unusual about him is you don't see a character like Subaru every so often in anime. In other words, you don't see a mostly realistic character like him all the time. He has a flawed personality  , just like every other human being on this planet, that will make you dislike him and some of his actions will make you cringe or question what in the fuck he's doing? However, I don't mean those statements in a bad way. Just put yourself in his shoes and think of how much shit he's gone through. Mental trauma can mess with your logical thinking and can cause you to do questionable actions like Subaru. \\n\\n\r\nIf you disliked/hate Subaru after the start of the 3rd Arc then the author has done his job. He's not supposed to be a stereotypical perfect MC and you're not supposed to side with him all the time. That was the author's intentions. Every human being has a flawed and shitty personality that other people hate. Some of us are hypocrites, some of us are a bunch of great liars or some of us look down on people for what they look like. What's his? He's a selfish prick who thinks that he should be rewarded for doing good deeds, hence the reason why the fight between him and Emilia even happened. Though, he did acknowledged all his actions and later redeemed himself. \\n\\n\r\nNext up is Emilia, a silver haired half-elf girl. She is a kind, good-natured girl who likes to help others but she faces discrimination from other people just because she looks like a Witch. Honestly, I don't have much to say about her because she was gone for most of the 3rd Arc and her character development was extremely lacking, making it hard for me to give a crap about her as opposed to Rem. I would have question the staff's motives because she's supposed to the be the heroine of the series and yet, she didn't get that much character development. Except she will, in the 2nd Season (if the series gets one). I read the 4th arc of the series and the 4th arc will definitely quiet down those people who are complaining that Emilia didn't get that much character development. Emilia is still one of my favourite characters though BUT the top spot goes to Rem. \\n\\n\r\nSince there's no way in hell I'm going to be talking about every characters in the series, I'm going to skip right to my favourite character of the series, Rem. When Rem was first introduced, I didn't give a shit about her. I thought she was going to be a side character since, you know, she's just a maid. This show surprised the hell out of me though. Not only did she get a screentime and character development in Arc 2, she turned out to be the best character in the series during Arc 3. In Arc 2, we learn about who she is and her background but in Arc 3, she showed everyone that she's clearly the BEST girl. She gained feelings for Subaru and turns out, that she's a badass and a loyal female character who's going to do everything to save Subaru, even if it kills her. She sacrificed herself countless times (In multiples timelines) just to save poor Subaru. It was pretty sad what happened to her during Ep. 18 but since I'm both a fan of Emilia and Rem, I really don't mind.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (10/10)\\n\r\nI've been following this show since the very 1st episode and I just want to say that watching Re:Zero has been one of the most enjoyable 25 weeks of my life. Sunday was blessed day for me and now that the show is over, Sunday won't ever feel the same again.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nAt first, Re:Zero felt like a stereotypical light novel anime adaptation but it turned out to be something different. Something that surprised the living hell out of me. Re:Zero may not be a masterpiece but it is one of the best shows this year and maybe in the past 5 years. Re:Zero's \"Psychological\" aspect was executed perfectly and is not something that should be taken lightly, the emotional scenes are impressive and mostly well-done but with some melodrama issues here and there. The characters are lovable, especially Rem, but when it comes to Subaru, he's not going to be beloved by many. Re:Zero's strongest element is its Outstanding Character Development. White Fox did an impressive job with how they handled the characters and their development in the series. Though, not all characters are developed but since I've read parts of Arc 4, I know that the author did not toss those characters aside. It just wasn't their time. Ugh, Sundays won't ever feel the same for me. \\n\\n\r\nNow I have one more request for White Fox. Please, Please make Season 2! (Once there's enough LN material)\\n\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9.7/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Good Story\\n\r\n+The \"Psychological\" element of the show was executed perfectly plus effective use of its cliffhanger\\n\r\n+Powerful Ep. 8, 11, 15, 23, and especially Episode 18 with outstanding 20 min. dialogue scene and outstanding cinematography\\n\r\n+Amazing Soundtrack plus the Insert Songs\\n\r\n+Amazing Voice Actors\\n\r\n+Great OP and ED theme songs\\n\r\n+Great Pacing, for the most part\\n\r\n+Re:Zero's number 1 strength is its Character Development and some emotional scenes\\n\r\n+Great cast of characters plus Subaru is one of the most realistic character in anime. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Show suffers from pacing issues at times\\n\r\n-Fighting Scene Animation was so-and-so in the 3rd Arc\\n\r\n-Some characters in the show, like Emilia and Beatrice, didn't get that much focus, screentime or character development in the 3rd Arc",

I was preparing to be disappointed since I was hearing good things from random people I didn't know, rather than my friends. However, I got a very pleasant surprise when I started watching it.\r\nImmediately you're thrown into a unique plot with great characters that makes you think a lot. It's extremely impressive how suspenseful even the first episode is, as well as each episode after that. The way the story is written and characters are developed was at a level I rarelyever get to see. Nearly every episode ends at a cliffhanger that just begs you to watch the next episode immediately. Usually I can bear the wait for an anime's next season, but this time I absolutely can't wait for the story to start up again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can say without question that this is one of the best, possibly even THE best anime I've ever seen. This is a must watch, and anyone who doesn't watch this is really missing out big time.",

            "content": "First of all, this is going to be a long review so if you have the time then read all the details (contains some minor spoilers). ReZero has become one of the successful light novel fantasy adaption of not just last decade but in history of anime ever. \r\nPlot: A normal/regular guy named Natsuki Subaru unexpectedly enters into a fantasy world full of animal like warriors, assassins, knights, witches, magic users and so on. While the story hasn\u2019t fully explained why he entered into the fantasy world in the first place, I am hoping all those explanations would come sometime at the end of thestory. Now about the story, the settings looked clich\u00e9 because travelling into a fantasy world was not uncommon thing in Anime series. So, just like many people I also thought that \u201cO well, this is going to be another clich\u00e9 fantasy anime\u201d turns out not to be and I got those findings at the end of the first episode. So, why did I think of that? Simply because the protagonist actually dies in the first episode! So, it seemed to be but he was revived after he was killed by an assassin along with the female protagonist. As the plot progresses, it was found out that Subaru has the power that\u2019s called \u201cReturned by Death\u201d (simple explanation he has the power to revive if he dies). So, as the plot progress we are introduced by new characters but before that we get to introduced to female protagonist, a half elf named \u201cEmilia\u201d whom Subaru falls for in first sight (though she called herself Satella which is refereed to jealous witch\u2019s name and there was no explanation why she told that in first place). The series sole motivation was to Subaru protecting Emilia. As the plot progresses, Subaru keeps dying and keeps reviving with occurring many events and trigger points (that\u2019s all I can say to keep the spoilers at minimum, the rest was for the viewers to find out).in terms of saying how much explainable the plot is very difficult because the plot itself was very complex.  All I can say the plot starts to thickness as it goes forward. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This section was one of the most highlighted factors of the series. There are lots of characters introduced in the series and each of those characters played their part just fine. I will focus on two factors here. Number one, Natsuki Subaru and Number two, Rem and Emilia. \\n\\n\r\nSo, how is Natsuki Subaru as a protagonist?\\n\\n\r\n1) He is just basically a common guy who might be an otaku/neet himself with no coolness about him whatsoever and have a Meta dialogue system of talking. (At first glances)\\n\r\n2) Became an absolutely annoying, stupid, horrible, bullshit type of character that you want to punch in the face. (In mid stage) \\n\r\n3) Realizing his stupidity, changes his attitudes and thinks with a brain and later become a master strategist with help of his power Return by Death (3rd Phase)\\n\\n\r\nSo, what can be said about Subaru as overall protagonist?\\n\\n\r\nIn my view he is not your cool type protagonist as you expect in a fantasy series. He is not the best protagonist either but he is exactly a character which doesn\u2019t goes with the flow and overall he is just like everyone of us, filled with smartness and stupidity which makes him a more humane protagonist and one of the best well written character in recent years. \\n\\n\r\nSection number 2, who is the main female lead, Emilia or Rem?\\n\\n\r\nI would say Rem for a particular time given she has more screen time than the half elf princess but in overall I would say Emilia given she is the center of everything for Subaru. While these two characters have their own role to play, the character development was a major success. \\n\r\nAnd finally we also have a guy whom we want to punch to death (Roman\u00e9e-Conti, Betelgeuse). To be honest, this is that one guy whom has gone to my all time hated character list. There\u2019s that one thing that I also noticed about re zero is that all the middle or minor side character has impact on the story which is very rare these days and those characters are much more involved in the story. \\n\\n\r\nMusic/OST\u2019s: Putting right kind of music in right scene is something always important for anime series to make viewers involving in it more and ReZero has certainly done it. Not to mention Myth & Roid has done great to opening and endings. Also, there were some unprecedented things that I have seen in this series and one of that is I have hardly seen any anime skip openings/endings to give much more content to the viewers. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: So, in the end in my view ReZero has become one of the successful series in not just this year but probably in last decade. There are some specific reasons as to why it has- \\n\\n\r\n1) In a directional point of view, it has been one heck of a series and kudos to director Watanabe, Masaharu who has worked in series like Zankyou no Terror, Air, Akame Ga Kill, Inuyasha but this is his first series where he directed the whole series and it was excellent. \\n\r\n2) The script was excellent and to add that we have got some well written character which gave us love and hate at the same time and almost 60% of characters are popular for their personality (don\u2019t know when the last time it has happened in a fantasy series) \\n\r\n3) This series has got so much trigger point and to strong at that. Some moments gave the viewers hope and some despair. The rotations of those moments are excellent. We get to see episodes full of actions, while we also get to see episode purely based on dialogues.\\n\r\n4) And finally, Logic and strategy never has gone with this series at the first place. So, overall the series has delivered perfectly with emotional drives in almost every episode. \\n\\n\r\nThat was a long review but these explanations aren\u2019t enough to judge the series. I haven\u2019t felt the amount of intensity for a long time while watching the series. Off course ReZero needs more seasons because there are tons of content in the Light Novel out there but even if there will no seasons for ReZero, it will go down as one of the top anime in fantasy genre ever in the history of anime. So, right now I can only finger crossed for more season! \\n",

            "content": "And so we are finally at the finish line\u2026 [A sort of review of Re:Zero]\r\nAnd so it has finally ended\u2026\r\nTo be honest, I think 25 episodes was just the right amount. On one hand, one cour would not have been enough to really capture the story. Arc 3 was instrumental in showcasing that the novel does have world building and the story is much more grand than the first two arcs might have one believe. If we had finished on arc 2, it would have looked like the story was entirely focused only on Subaru, his suffering and that the rest of the world doesn\u2019treally exist.\\n\r\nIt got to a point where I was theorizing that the entire world of the show was just a product of Subaru\u2019s mind. That nothing was real and it was all in his head. If there was no arc 3, I would have really believed this to be the case, but now it\u2019s clear that the world of Re:Zero is, without a doubt, alive and full of storylines.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we had more episodes, I feel like the show would start to get stale. The thing with Re:Zero is that, whilst the writing is REALLY good, it\u2019s still fairly simplistic. It gives me very strong Kawahara vibes (author of SAO) in that he is an extremely skilled writer, but is creating a product for the general public to consume, not avid readers. It\u2019s like a gourmet pizza. It\u2019s gourmet alright, but it\u2019s still just a pizza.\\n\r\nSo if we had another cour or two, I feel like the hype of the show would start to go down towards the end. People would start to get slightly bored.\\n\r\nAnd so 25 episodes is just the right amount to perfectly get across what Re:Zero is and to hook people to go and read the light novels. Luckily, with all this hype around, a lot of people have taken up to translate so I expect many volumes to be done in a very short amount of time.\\n\r\nThe people who REALLY got invested in the idea of Re:Zero, will now have an excellent LN to pick up, while anime fans will be able to end this show with a good impression.\\n\r\nIt reminds me of Spice&Wolf, actually. Funnily enough, done by the same studio, that show also ended on a very good note to hook the viewer to try the LN without getting even slightly stale.\\n\r\nSo with that said, on to some reviewing!\\n\r\nThe best way I could describe this show, is a very, VERY long movie. Each arc felt VERY much like a separate movie with way more content than a movie would normally have.\\n\r\nThe thing with most LNs and anime shows in general is that they\u2019re made to have a slow plot progression. After every big plot checkmark, there will be a fairly long period of \u201csettling down\u201d on the new \u201clevel\u201d within the story. There will always be a lot of time spent on increasing the depth of the characters or on building the world. These moments where any events that happen don\u2019t really \u201cmean\u201d anything. They\u2019re just there to help us develop our understanding and view of the characters.\\n\r\nI think Re:Zero is exactly about this concept and approaching it in an entirely different way.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a show where character and world building happen while having huge plot developments and then using \u201cReturn by death\u201d to reset said plot development, but keep our new understanding of the characters valid.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty ingenious and VERY different from everything else that dealt with similar mechanics. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s how I always envisioned time travel stories to play out. Using different timelines as a means to learn something to then use in the original timeline.\\n\r\nThis parallel of an MC that is constantly changing due to the events that surround him and the cast that change only based on the events of the one timeline they\u2019re in. The fact that towards the end of the show, White Fox managed to really make these characters feel \u201calive\u201d is proof of their extreme competence as a studio and the brilliance of the author.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point that must not be missed is how this show managed to go so mainstream, while taking so many story risks. By this I mean that the story itself was not filled with fanservice and over-positive outcomes towards the main cast like in most other light novels. One of the greatest issues with a lot of current light novels that deal with world-transportation is that the MC ends up being invincible from the very start. There is always huge risk involved, but the MC always ends up winning and never suffers even a little bit.\\n\r\nRe:Zero throws this entire concept out of the window and tries to tell a realistic and gritty tale. A tale of what being stuck in another world could really mean. The constant helplessness, powerlessness and the feel of isolation. All these emotions are VERY difficult to stomach for a viewer and are generally avoided by these young new LN authors and anime studios. They try to tell a story which the viewer could self-insert into and feel better about themselves fantasizing about it.\\n\r\nSelf-inserting in this context is really a plague of extremely boring and WORTHLESS story-telling where the viewer doesn\u2019t learn anything. It\u2019s just like watching fireworks. They look cool, sure, but do they have any value apart from looking cool? Almost none.\\n\r\nGood storytelling is managing to play with the viewers emotions, making him care for the characters within the story and to learn something along the way.\\n\r\nRe:Zero does this job perfectly. It\u2019s taking the concept of \u201cstuck in another world\u201d and creating a story WORTH TELLING. A story that exists not just to make money, but to actually have artistic value in itself.\\n\r\nThe word is really artistic value. Can anyone really say that the majority of these recent trope stories have any artistic value? That they make a person really think about things and feel more emotions than what a drug would give? \\n\r\nRe:Zero is a slap to the face of this type of worthless storytelling. A wake up call for authors that it IS possible in this day and age to attract an audience towards a story that is not glorious, but actually gritty, brutal and can make the viewer feel sick to the bone.\\n\r\nI genuinely dropped the show for a while when Arc3 started because the pitifulness of Subaru felt like too much. I couldn\u2019t handle watching him completely lose his sense of reality in front of everyone. It was a horrible experience.\\n\r\nHowever, I never, not even for a moment, think that I\u2019m dropping this show because it\u2019s bad. I did it because it was so good at showcasing something so horrid. I just wanted to wait till enough episodes came out to actually reach a conclusion and not be stuck on such a pitiful state. I basically binged the remaining 10 episodes in 2 sessions of 5 episodes each. 5 weeks apart.\\n\r\nNow, here\u2019s the big question : is Re:Zero really that good?\\n\r\nNo, It\u2019s really not a masterpiece. As brave as this show was, it still let itself be restrained by the genre. It simply wasn\u2019t a multi-layered show. It had the core ideas presented from the start of the show, but didn\u2019t attempt to explore any concepts TOO brave, nor did the show feature very strong multi-layered personalities. They still felt like characters from a fantasy work and not people that one could write essay after essay about.\\n\r\nRe:Zero just wasn\u2019t attempting to express ideas that people could talk about for years in the future.\\n\r\nThe parallel to draw here would be shows like NGE, which manages to talk about real world problems at length  and make people really THINK about the problems surrounding our society. \\n\r\nRe:Zero does not attempt to make use pose such questions. It simply has a tale it wants to tell. This means that, whilst within it\u2019s own boundry, the show is absolutely amazing. The boundry itself is too small to really reach the epitome of what an anime or a story in general can be capable of.\\n\r\nI will rate the show a 9 out of 10, with the distribution being:\\n\r\nAdaptation quality : 10/10. White Fox keeps proving itself as one of, if not the greatest studio when it comes to really capturing a source material.\t\\n\r\nStory : 10/10. A brilliant tale that felt like a movie from start to finish. At no point in time did it feel boring or slow. Everything had a meaning.\\n\r\nCharacters : 9/10. Subaru will go down in history as one of the most realistic MCs we\u2019ve had in anime in a long time. The rest of the cast have also shown a high level of complexity. However, the show didn\u2019t have anyone of the level of truly masterful characters (ex Holo, Shinji).\\n\r\nRealization of it\u2019s purpose: 10/10. The author had very clear ideas that he wanted to get across with this story and he did it flawlessly. \\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the purpose itself of the show just wasn\u2019t grand enough to warrant a masterpiece status so a 9 is as high as I would go. \\n\r\nRe:Zero should go down in history as a new addition to the \u201cmust watch\u201d lists to NEW anime fans and viewers who want to really see the \u201cstuck in another world\u201d genre expressed in a truly artistic way with actual value.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a deconstruction of a genre, but it\u2019s definitely a very valuable work that shows where the genre can be taken.\\n\r\nNow if a writer were to take this entire genre and the groundwork that Re:Zero has laid and then attempted to break the 4th wall of the genre (actually connecting the fantasy world with the real world). Making the story not about an MC who is basically an immigrant from reality, but a story about taking shelter in the fantasy world to escape the real world or to use it as a means to better himself, then we could find ourselves a masterpiece.\\n\r\nIf we could just have a writer as competent as Tappei Nagatsuki(Re:Zero) write a story based on the ideas of Reki Kawahara(SAO) with the writing prowess of someone like Nisio Isin(Monogatari) then we could really see this genre taken to the absolute limit.\\n",

However, such a person is common in our society, so I can sympathize with him.\r\nSecondly, this story attracts me, especially the last parts. I could not wait for the next ones. To be honest, I am not satisfied with the final episode because some parts are unclear, for instance, Rem.\r\nOverall, this anime is definitely categorized as one of thebest Animes in this year and I would like to recommend this to my friends.",

            "content": "Tho this time is A TOTAL MASTERPIECE. I will say it now, if you are wondering wether to watch it GO FOR IT!. EDIT: This anime doesnt give a shit about endings and openings, and its episodes are long, like 23~24 minutes. \r\nStory? Well this is basically like... steins;gate + psychological and some crazy twists. This anime is exploring grief and has really realisitic reactions on the character's side. The plot is original, yet almost all episodes make you want to learn japanese so you can watch the next one 12 hours earlier. To be honest that is one of the best stories ihave ever seen, and i have watched animes for over 7 years. Like there is so much covered in this story that is impossible for me to think of it all right here right now. It has romance, cute scenes, not the stupid reactions of the male's side that is so common. You even have some complex love stuff, humour (but not the stupid jokes we have seen 1000x times but actual fun stuff) and many more! You can see the main has real love for real, and is a guy who chooses even to give up! Like thats not something you see in animes, you mostly see that the character has his no-give up believe from where he gets all his power... I dont say its a bad thing, but I have seen it wayy too much. To be honest i cant believe there is a 3 point review on the top. Thats like... cmon, that anime deserves 10/10 just because Betelgeuse!\\n\\n\r\nArt? Well I dont think i need to explain. You just gotta see. The fight scenes, the sad scenes, its all beautiful and FABULOUS! The crazy and psycho scenes are also really well made! Just 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nSound? About the sound... its not an exception. Like many other masterpieces, the sound connects with the plot and the characters so well and so good... Sometimes I dont even hear the sound. It connects that good, that you dont actually realise its there, you can experience the show fully. I believe the sound is like a huge part of an anime, and it can bring down the best stories. This one is of the good ones tho. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters... Here I can basically write so much. It has love, it has hatred, it has all those natural human emotions you rarely see in animes... like shame and self hatred. To be honest this 3* review frustrated me... Like cmon, this guy watched for real a lot of tsunderes animes and is mixing up stuff. Rem is not even flat chested. We just have Emilia who is someone used to hatred and disrespect, so she is shocked when someone loves her. Although here you have none of the annoying blush ups and half kisses. Subaro is one of the best characters, he is down, then up again and then down again. Its really good one, and you dont see him believing in himself from the begining. You can actually see him changing in good and bad ways. To be honest I could describe everything with LOVE. This anime makes my brain TREMBLE!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Made my brain tremble, and is still trembling!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 11/10. For real. If you are still reading and havent opened new tab searching for horrible subs or other place to watch it, what are you doing? Dont need to respect me for my review, go watch it and thank me later. DONT, i repear DONT listein this guy who rated it 3/10. This guy is crazy. He supposedly watched the anime in 2x. But hey, there is the saying that a negative person can find the best and purest love being rotten shit. So... if you are not a total pessimist, laden by life... dont watch it. Well actually, you can watch it, because SURPRISE SURPRISE you can find yourself in Subaru. \\n\\n\r\nPS: If you find something bad in the anime, and focus on it, and not on the overflowing masterpieceness, damn, why are you even watching animes? You wont like any of them.\\n",

            "content": "Re:Zero is an amazing anime, one of the best I've seen to date. I've felt a plethora of emotions while watching every episode, ranging from sadness, joy, anger, etc. I was hooked since the first episode and often, the wait until next week's episode would be unbearable. It was extremely difficult not to read spoilers, the web novel, or the light novels after finishing an episode. I loved that within a single episode, there would be silly moments that made me laugh and smile and on the other side of the spectrum, moments to which I would be on the edge of my seat andmy mind racing. I have to say, the author is truly skilled at manipulating the hearts and emotions of the audience.\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I loved all of most of the characters and their own unique personalities. Subaru, for example, really seems like a normal person, instead of the typical protagonists with barely any faults. He smiles, laughs, cries, gets angry, and breaks down when he's put under hard circumstances that are difficult to overcome. With this, it was easy for me to relate to this character and replicate his emotions. \\n\r\nThe voice actors and actresses did an amazing job, capturing the emotions of the characters with every word, as well as the opening, ending, and soundtrack adding more on to this incredible anime. \\n\r\nI hope that the second season of Re:Zero comes out soon because I can't wait to see what's in store for Subaru, Emilia, Rem, and the rest!",

            "content": "BEST. ANIME. EVER.\r\nWith that out of the way, here's my totally unbiased review of Re:Zero :D\r\n--- STORY (10/10) ---\r\nThe story is split into a few arcs each of which is looped until Subaru (the MC) manages to reach a new \"checkpoint\". As with any time-looping movie or TV show, each loop has to bring forth a new piece of the story to keep the viewer engaged - and boy does it deliver. There aren't many slow points in the plot, and it easily had me on the edge of my seat the entire time (even when I wasn't watching the show, with some evil cliffhangers that concluded most episodes). There wasn't a moment I was bored, so if there's one thing the author nailed, it's the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real quibble I have with the story is that I think the suffering got stretched out a bit too much. In the second half of the season, it reached the point that it was actually surprising when something *didn't* go horribly wrong. It was starting to get a bit old, before the story was switched up again (to help keep things fresh).\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion was a bit weak, but I can understand why. The second season is an uncertain proposition at this point (due to limited source material, not popularity). I NEEDZ A SECOND SEASON YO!\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, it has a great plot with plenty of twists that had me running around shouting \"WHAT THE FRICK JUST HAPPENED?!!\" most weeks.\\n\\n\r\n--- ART (10/10) ---\\n\r\nThey nailed it. The cinematography, boss battles, fight scenes and animation were top notch. The tone can be cheery or extremely dark depending on what's called for by the story (though lacks any exaggerated chibi in moments of comedy - which surprised me a bit). It's a very pretty show that will have frames featured as my desktop wallpaper for a while.\\n\\n\r\n--- SOUND (10/10) ---\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were superb for both halves of the series (but I have to say, I really liked the first opening the best), and the soundtrack...\\n\\n\r\n... the sound track hits you right in the feels when it needs to.\\n\\n\r\n--- CHARACTER (10/10) ---\\n\r\nMaybe I just haven't seen enough anime with characters that aren't flat, but Re:Zero has the best written and development characters I've seen in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nSubaru starts off as a bit of a dunderhead, treating the whole world as if it's a video game, with plenty of other character flaws besides (some of which get ironed out later, but some still stick). He's still likable from the start, but he's initially a bit of an arrogant douche bag, who expects the world to revolve around him.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes some hard lessons before he pulls his act together and stops expecting everyone to treat him like the MC of a shounen (even though he's ironically the MC of a shounen-ish show).\\n\\n\r\nI've been focusing a lot on Subaru, because he's the MC, but almost every significant character in the show has some depth, each with their own values and ambitions. Characters who are commonly flat, and seem that flat at first, end up being prominent parts of the story later on.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guys are mostly driven by insanity, and are probably the weakest in terms of character depth. But hey, who doesn't love a good crazy bad guy?\\n\\n\r\n--- ENJOYMENT (10/10) ---\\n\r\nIn case my previous gushing didn't make it clear: yeah - I *really* liked this show. After watching each episode every Sunday night, it was a pity to go back to whatever anime I happened to be binge watching at the time, since nothing really compares to it. It's easily one of my top favorite anime of all time, and I'm excited to see what season two brings.\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nIn the meantime, you'll probably find me listening to MYTH&ROID, while flaming on Reddit that REM IS BEST GIRL - while my brain... trembles...",

            "content": "Love is a lot like a gun. It kills you, you kills yourself with it, you kill other people with it, it kills everyone you love, it kills your hopes and dreams, I think I\u2019m off topic. Re:Zero -Starting life in another world- is an anime about a protagonist named Natsuki Subaru who is randomly teleported into another world where his life is saved by a girl named Satella. This is directly followed up by his discovery that he has the ability to reset to certain points of time upon his death, and so he has to figure out his survival in the world. Throughoutthe show there is the constant discussion of themes of hopelessness, stress, and depression. Although there is a contrast in its themes of happiness, love, and care. Additionally to even that, there is a dynamic interplay between these two subject matters.The light and dark balance in Re:Zero is shown throughout the series effortlessly by director Masaharu Watanabe and studio White Fox. These themes can be shown through several characters from the shows huge and extremely well utilized cast, through its repeated use of contrast, and finally its use of allegory to express both darkness and light within the characters emotions.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, it helps to define light and dark. Re:Zero approaches the darkness of Subaru\u2019s character by showing him as an emotional time bomb. Like anyone, he has a breaking point, and releases it all in vents and fits of destructive rage. The light in him though is his drive, and his direct passion towards what he does. What stands out most about Subaru, is he has a truly defined personality, and a dynamic character. Each interaction leading to a deeper connection with his inner character and the ones he\u2019s communicating with. He breaks, and builds himself back up again. This balance of light and dark character is very well linked to the first emotion I\u2019d like to discuss.\\n\\n\r\nDespair is a common theme throughout the show, although it may be more fitting to say depression and the general despair that comes along with it. Subaru is very deep rooted in apathy, and repressive of his emotions. This show does a great job of pacing his growth, and not giving the protagonist what he wants. It repeatedly kills him (literally) and each time you hate to see him die. The director expertly frames and times shots to make viewers feel each and every gnawing bite of the deaths. The feeling of going back to where you started and suffering so much along the way, makes the pay off so much more worth it. The show constantly keeps viewers on their toes with it\u2019s use of thriller elements, making viewers worry about what\u2019s out of frame than what\u2019s in. Overall, it\u2019s a very western approach to directing and film craft, and demonstrates a great strength on studio White Fox\u2019s part. Though, the writing is what makes this shine. \\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS BEGIN)\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 18 of this show (From Zero) which is nearly entirely dedicated to the interactions between two of the shows main characters, Subaru and Rem. Rem is very representative of simple happiness. Something short term, tempting, and fleeting. Something easy. Rem is set up through some admittedly hamfisted symbolism with stories about demons and flower pots, but it sets up for a character that understands regret and that clinging onto short term happiness and cruelness. Something she does not want to see Subaru suffer through, so despite her love for Subaru, denies him, knowing that he will feel the same regret. The regret and guilt that she would not wish upon anyone. Rem\u2019s character seems to be a popular love interest among the community, but he fundamental existence is to reject Subaru, and promote his love for someone else. Someone whose selfishness has ruined her, leading her to a life of selflessness\\These events lead to Subaru approaching a lighter view on life. Approaching hope, and overcoming his apathy and denial and fear. It\u2019s showing him finally grasping at true happiness.\\n\\n\r\nAnother theme this show entangles with is love. Love is something that is shown through the shows main villain, and through Subaru, both in wildly different ways. Betelgeuse is a character who approaches love as a sort of obsession, thinking of love as a reward for work. He makes it his life to wound and destroy himself for the sake of a single love. Something that would be easy to compare to with Subaru, a character who suffers repeatedly being gored, beaten, starved, betrayed, and frozen to death, for the sake of a single girl. The difference spurs from why they do it. Betelgeuse approaches his love for the witch (who looks identical to Subaru\u2019s love interest, seriously I cannot defend the in your face symbolism in this show) as a need. Something he must complete, like it is his destiny. He takes the pain like a heartbeat. Though Subaru approaches the pain with his own will, and desire. Going back to Rem, she is an easy way out and he denies it. Subaru makes his choices to put himself in that position, and it is all for one reason that he completely dedicates his ability to one girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe last emotion is happiness. The shows finale, titled \u2018that\u2019s all this story is about\u2019, which basically inspired me to write this. The end of the show is a dialogue between Subaru and his love interest, Satella/Emilia. Emilia is Subaru\u2019s goal for the whole show, because in Emilia, Subaru\u2019s character sees happiness. He struggles through despair and depression to approach that happiness, that end goal. Not the false and easy happiness that Rem offers, not the hopeless and overly dedicated happiness that Betelgeuse wants to achieve with the witch, but true loving happiness. The show is a love story, that\u2019s all this story is about, but there is so much to a love story. No romance goes without despair, or test, or suffering. Sometimes you have to go back to the beginning and try again and again, throwing yourself at the same wall over and over until you find a way around. True happiness isn\u2019t something you can give up on. That\u2019s what this story is all about. \\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS END)\\n\\n\r\nThough, Re:Zero is not perfect. From a production standpoint, the animation is choppy at best. A gratuitous use of CGI is upsetting, especially from White Fox\u2019s visual beauty that is Akame Ga Kill (Not calling Akame Ga Kill a good show, just a pretty one). CGI is good in moderation, something that this show does not know how to use. Additionally in the area of moderation, the hamfisted symbolism mentioned above is very overused. It has a tendency to treat its audience like idiots, several times making me roll my eyes. It is messy in that regard, and a little upsetting. Even more than that though, it\u2019ll resort to genre tropes like cherry blossoms and doves to almost insult a viewer with any semblance of a brain. The show does a very good job avoiding the harem anime that it could so easily become, but doesn\u2019t hide the fact that being a harem anime was definitely on the table (hence why it is getting a visual novel.) Lastly, even though it isn\u2019t awful, only one or two pieces of the soundtrack stood out. There isn\u2019t enough there to really make a huge difference.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Re:Zero -starting life in another world- confronts themes in a clever way that amy not be on evangelion levels of symbolism and shakespearean scale, but it does set itself apart from the currently lackluster anime mainstream. The only major complaint is its use of open plotlines, setting up for season 2. The show does stand on its own two feet, with the removal of some of the Felt plot line, shaving down the big fight in the later episodes (you know the one if you\u2019ve watched it), and even cutting out some character development scenes, this show could easily be 6-10ish hours long, instead of the monstrous 14 hours it does not have to be. Additionally it would stand on it\u2019s own. Though, if the author has a story to tell, I would love to hear it.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10, though some of the symbolism is shoved down your throat, it\u2019s smart enough to more than carry its own weight in an oversaturated genre.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10, with very few unmemorable characters and almost every member of the cast holding some emotional weight, it is hard to watch this show without falling in love with all of them.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 4/10, White Fox pls\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10, above average. Some memorable songs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10, Way too much fun, between the suspense, the heart, and the action, I think this may be the show to get me back into my almost two year hiatus from anime. This is mostly personal though...",

It features a very unique protagonist that in my opinion is way more realistic than most. The characters in the series each have their own zing and the ships/fights/sad moments hit really good and hard.\r\nEvery episode had me clenched to my seat the entire time. The joy of a new episode coming out after the dreadful week-long wait was amazing.\r\nLook, you and I both know, we don't have the time to read long reviews or write them.\r\nSo just go ahead and watch Re:Zero, trust me, you WILL NOT bedisappointed.",

            "content": "Ah, abolishing the absurdity of the typical weak protagonist that never dies--- This is an outstanding anime that you may want to go into blind. Imagine you're a male protagonist trying to save that cute elf girl who gives you the \"butterflies\", but then she becomes the reason why you get a different stomach-opening type of \"butterflies\". Finishing this anime will probably leave you bae-tleguesing your fingers, mouth wide-open, and with a huge smile while your brain TREMBLES at how amazing this series was. Every episode leaves you in suspense, and some episodes even give you moments of unbearable cringe where it's difficult to watch.Some of the villains are crazy enough to make you think \"WHAT THE FUUU--*beep*-...\" (I definitely meant fudge... what were you thinking...? baka...)\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero's flawless execution, lovably unique characters, beautiful art, and good soundtrack leaves very little to be desired as it captures your heart and takes you on a unique psychological fantasy adventure. This is an anime that has become one of the many outstanding gems of the Anime genre like common fantasy/psychological favorites like Code Geass, Madoka Magica, Katanagatari, Shinsekai Yori and I want to say SAO but people give that so much hate for no good reason.\\n\\n\r\nStory:10/10\\n\r\nSuddenly summoned from this world to another world, what should you do? Subaru answers these questions using his broad, grand otaku knowledge. He gets ambushed by some typical thugs and gets saved by the beautiful half-elf protagonist, Emilia thus beginning his happy-happy, lovey dove, overpowered fantasy world story. Unfortunately for him, that's the opposite of what actually happens. In a fantastic twist, he's your thrown into a series of gut-opening horrific tragedies that earn this anime the right to call itself a psychological anime. In this fantasy world, Subaru has only one power: the power to return to a certain point in the past by dying. He tries desperately to be the story's hero, but like many fantasy games will teach you playing hero can cause you tons of... well... Damage---See what I did there? ;) ;) ;)--- Subaru has many difficult obstacles to overcome, they're so difficult to overcome that they can actually cost a guy his life! He meets a large variety of outstanding characters, all of whom have depth to their personalities; there are almost no typical characters in sight. Pacing is outstanding, I feel the pacing is designed to make you feel the desperation and agony of the main character where even small actions can be event changing (butterfly effect).\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is absolutely fantastic. The progression of events has a major degree of realism to it, contrary to many anime out there. Honestly, everything about the story is outstanding enough that I could talk any the series' premise and plot progression is for several paragraphs without any spoilers \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nNearly every character is memorable and unique! That's extremely difficult to achieve and ice only seen a few anime succeed at it.\\n\\n\r\nJust to go over a few:\\n\\n\r\nStarting with Rem: I won't say too much but know that Rem is a truly fearsome character. She's skillful at performing maid tasks and un-trusting, but she's also loveable to the point where she has won the heart of most Re:Zero watchers. In contrast to her red haired twin sister Ram who's laid back and relaxed, but trusting and less lovable.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru: What makes Subaru special is that there's nothing special about him and he's actually pretty immature and dumb. Like really dumb. He's just an average guy that's kind and wants his happy fantasy life and the happiness of the people. No special powers). No superhuman reflexes. He is just like me and you. He does his \"best\" despite being faced with so many tragic events which are quite honorable. He's also one of my least favorite characters in the series, but hey! Still unique!\\n\\n\r\nEmilia, a lonely introverted loving half-elf that's been mistreated and ostracized by the general public due to their fears of the legend of the witch. \\n\\n\r\nEverybody in the mansion, the Knights, the villagers, the villains, the princesses, all of them are outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nA certain bae-tleguese will even reach out to you with open arms!\\n\\n\r\nYou may get a new favorite character from this series! \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art makes you feel with the characters, the animation is fluid the facial expressions are believable, everything is top notch quality. Some scenes will make you cringe. The only reason I can't call it a 10 is because of Fate Unlimited Bladeworks and other similar quality anime or unique styled anime like Katanagatari. Character designs are beautiful and interesting. There are funny speaking magic clown lords, maids, catgirls, cat traps, queen-like characters, tomboy lolis, bae-tlegueses, this series has it all!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the sound is the weakest aspect of the anime. The sounds are really good, don't get me wrong. But imagine if the music was as unique and memorable as Kill la Kill, Madoka Magica, Naruto, Bleach, One Piece etc. I know I named the big three, but seriously their soundtracks are outstanding if you've ever paid attention to them. The battle effects are top notch. Voice actors and actresses are great. But the music contains some pretty mediocre cinematic music. Unlike a certain \"coffee soda toffee pasta.\" (if you don't get it, it's from SAO gleam eyes fight by the lovely Yuki Kajiura)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9/10\\n\r\nOnly a few moments went by that I didn't think this anime was outstanding. I was hooked by episode 4. I'm an adult, but at certain scenes, I cringed so hard that I actually couldn't watch them. That has never happened to me in any anime that I've seen. Never once. This anime has earned its spot as rank 10 on my top 10 anime list. I really believe that you will enjoy it if you like psychological, fantasy, action, Mystery, Game, or any of the anime that I've mentioned so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9.5/10\\n\r\nIt would be a full 10 if it had a better soundtrack, but the soundtrack thing really doesn't matter to me much since everything else is simply outstanding. I highly recommend that you put this one on your watchlist if you haven't already! ^.^b There will likely be a season two because of this anime's popularity worldwide so see you next time!",

            "content": "(possibly some spoilers \u2013 especially for episode 18)\r\nOpera is a very hard medium to get into, and I have never been able to breach the gap into it. Half of this is probably because I\u2019m unable to link the words themselves to the music going on since I don\u2019t exactly know languages like German or Italian. When I look at it from a God\u2019s eye view \u2013 the plots are extremely and ridiculously melodramatic. Because I am unable to link the music properly to the lyrics, I cannot jump across into the realm of heightened and overexcessive emotion that it requires. On the other hand,I\u2019m able to do so for English musicals like any of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s stuff.\\n\\n\r\nA plot that does not make logical or psychological sense must, at the very least, make emotional sense. No matter how ridiculous the events are \u2013 I am perfectly okay with it as long as it is able to hold that excessive operatic tenor which focuses the raw experience itself. This is why one of my favorite movies is Zulawski\u2019s Possession \u2013 a movie that throws out any semblance of a proper narrative for a bizarre sense of overstimulation.\\n\\n\r\nReZero does not make much logical sense. It presumes that a hikikomori protagonist who self-trains will have great strength (logical) as well as the spatial awareness to manage a wide variety of combat scenarios (illogical). Oldboy has the same premise, but in there it takes the protagonist 16 years \u2013 and although that prospect is still quite shifty, it\u2019s a lot less shifty than ReZero. The Oldboy movie is able to counterbalance this by having its fight scenes (especially the hallway one) be raw enough to show that he\u2019s merely pushing his way through by the skin of his teeth. Not so in ReZero.\\n\\n\r\nIt also makes little logical sense as to why the heroines would attach themselves so swiftly to the protagonist in such a short time frame. I will not dwell on this point since many people out there have probably analyzed this aspect of the plot excessively.\\n\\n\r\nI was initially intrigued with ReZero given that the first 4 episodes or so were logical in their development, if you can accept the axioms of Subaru being the type of character with the capabilities he has, and Emilia being the type of person she is. The time loop aspect was utilized very well in how it would provide multiple perspectives with regards to a small scenario to create a sense of mystery despite it being merely a simple encounter. The reveals were fair and adequate \u2013 he explores every possibility and we get a whole idea of what has to be done. How the conclusion of that arc unfolded utilized a deus ex machina, but it was one fitting within the realm of what ReZero was trying to convey \u2013 Subaru\u2019s powerlessness in a world he doesn\u2019t understand.\\n\\n\r\nThe mansion arc was where it started slipping, given that they were not as fair with the plot. In the first four episodes, most of the components of the crisis were revealed to us. In the entire mansion portion, it extensively relied on late and sudden reveals usually coming from the \u2018know-it-all-but-does-nothing\u2019 character of Beatrice. Furthermore it spent too much time on grating slice-of-life and irritatingly long psychological exposition that bases itself on that kind of \u2018fish-out-of-the-water\u2019 story for the character of Rem. The visual novel Shinju no Yakata has a route involving Twins with almost similar plot aspects \u2013 but it is done in a completely different manner.\\n\\n\r\nBut with all of the above flaws mentioned \u2013 does it make emotional sense? This is where the entire power of White Fox as an animation studio comes in. Their animation is crisp and it can create that sense of a fantasy town with a slightly darker feel. A problem is this \u2013 for the emotional heights, with regards to characters, they rely too much on the most conventional methods of emotional resonance. A girl standing in the middle of glowing lights. A girl basking in sunlight. A fluttering of doves. Abuse of dusk lighting. Dutch Angles to show unease, mixed with creepy vocal choirs. All of these abused with complete sincerity, without any counterbalance, and without any greater kind of beautiful spin on it. When you combine this with the already unreal characterization, you get a simultaneous sense of emotional resonance and plain manipulativeness. Possession, on the other hand is a film where the camera gets right into the actor\u2019s and actresses\u2019 faces, with sickly backgrounds and a focus on their body contortions and movements.\\n\\n\r\nIt took a full 13 episodes before White Fox began to show dignity in their abilities. ReZero is able to pull off a scale even greater than a work like Attack on Titan at times. One of the most operatically overwrought and beautiful moments is the \u2018blizzard ending\u2019 of episode 14 or the caravan chase. As the plot builds up, it really mimics that feeling of a world vastly vastly greater than any of its inhabitants \u2013 massive beasts, mad cultists in dark dungeons, regal proceedings etc\u2026 This is where the aesthetics most match the emotional tone of whatever is happening within the plot \u2013 moreso than any other moment. \\n\\n\r\nSome people have characterized this as a non-stop tirade of violence and suffering for the sake of sheer manipulation. That is true, but that is only in the realm of content \u2013 but what makes a work like ReZero different (at times, although a lot of it is true blue misery porn) from a lot of other misery porn is that White Fox\u2019s usage of scale allows the plot to orient away, at times, from the smallness of the character\u2019s feelings. These moments, few as they are, creates that kind of perspective that person like Lovecraft was fond of exploring. The cosmic horror and insignificance perspective.\\n\\n\r\nYet, unlike a work like Evangelion, the problem is that while the animation helps to pull the plot out \u2013 the plot is always there to dive back inside the fray a thousandfold \u2013 back to those melodramatic moments without any sense of aesthetics or any new take. The widely favored episode 18 is merely a recapitulation of a Shinji type awakening. The difference is that Anno limited the actual Congratulations moment to the last few minutes, and spent most of it in internal doubt and rumination. On the other hand, Re Zero is quick to show that Subaru will be able to get his cathartic moment, and he will get immediate reprieve for it, and then he falls back into his catharsis, and gets reprieve. This is like an entire 15-20 minutes of Shinji being hugged and kissed by the plot. It is also done in a kind of ridiculously stale way full of sunlight and flying white birds. It is excessive in a bad way, and not an operatic way. Think about how the impact would have been if the scene had been shot with no focus on the character\u2019s faces or expressions at all, but only on various different camera angles or body parts \u2013 only giving a direct view of Rem at the last moment. Compared to the stretch that came before it, I do not think particularly highly of this episode \u2013 even though it provides a just realization to the protagonist and is the most psychologically direct scene in the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nOn a personal level, I give this show a 9 \u2013 purely due to schadenfreude. I hope this success will mean that White Fox will get to adapt weird things like Katanagatari again.\\n",

But after the first episode I realized that it was starting to drift away from the clich\u00e9s into something more different. By the end of the anime it almost felt like it wasn't even in the same genre of anime anymore. It turned into more of a drama, romance.\r\n(Art)\r\nThe animation and style of the anime was a bit more polished up than other anime. The art style wasn't really mind blowing but it wasn't terribleeither.\\n\\n\r\n(Sound)\\n\r\nThe openings and endings to the anime are all quite nice and catchy.\\n\\n\r\n(Character)\\n\r\nI definitely think the characters were designed nicely corresponding to each of the character's personalities. Some characters though were never seen again. Such as Felt she was seen from episodes 1-3 and randomly in another episode. The character development was nice and steady not rushed most of the time.\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment)\\n\r\nI genuinely enjoyed the anime. From the music to the plot and the characters. It was a very enjoyable anime with a unique plot. \\n\\n\r\n(Overall)\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this anime to all kinds of anime watchers. I believe that people would like this anime. Definitely could use some work on character development here and there along with bringing some characters back that are rarely seen. It's a good anime but not a masterpiece.",

Ok I need one minute \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026..(performs exorcism on computer so Mal friends don\u2019t get angry and destroy heart)\u2026\u2026... Now before my heart gets torn I will drink and give my thoughts on Re: Zero an anime that has become one of the highlights the community praise for the last six months. Brought to you by the studio White Fox that gave us anime like \u201cSteins Gate\u201d and \u201cAkame Ga Kill\u201d, Zero is a combination of \u201cStein Gates\u201d well renowned time travel scenario and \u201cAkame GaKill\u2019s\u201d horrible violence times two.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the show honestly as there was not much to hate about it on my end. I have always been into the concept of time travel and I am also a bit of a sadist and love to see characters suffer, I guess that is what happens when all you watched before anime is \u201cDoctor Who\u201d, \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d. The story with Re: Zero is that I just decided to binge watch the whole show in around three days on a free weekend up to the last episode. To be honest I feel kind of empty after watching it and am very sad at the idea that a continuation will likely not happen till 2019 by the looks of things.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway I will get on to the review at hand\u2026\u2026\u2026(dark hard is crushing heart)\u2026\u2026\u2026. (drinks alcohol and gets over it)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Anyway Re: Zero is one of those anime where the character goes to another universe where everything is all knights, dragons and magic. Generally you probably have seen this before in anime like \u201cG.A.T.E.\u201d where the Japanese military go through a portal to a magical world, or the likes of \u201cKonosuba\u201d which is an opposite to Re: Zero in this sub-genre where \u201cKonosuba\u201d is all humor and LOL\u2019s, Zero is all darkness and tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike \u201cG.A.T.E\u201d where you follow a rag tag team of elite soldiers and harem girls all out winning in an alternate reality. Zero follows a character whom is always losing and must make smart changes in personality and decision making to win against a dark fate. Some would compare this series to SAO MMO alternate reality but the character is not playing an MMO but is playing a very painful version of Dark Souls by the looks of things. Also unlike SAO we don\u2019t follow a harem magnet garry stu but a character we can consider a Jackass called Subaru \u2026\u2026\u2026.(noticed grip on heart loosened when calling Subaru a jackass and taking a joke out of SAO)\u2026\u2026\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nOne day our MC like many of us is reading Manga and getting some food at a local convenient store after a whole day of gaming, probably not playing dark souls considering what constantly happens in this show cause you think he know better. When leaving the convenience store he finds himself in another reality where everything is medieval and demi humans walk the streets with humans. So what happens to Subaru then? Does he get a magic weapon? No, does he get told an ancient prophecy? No, does he meet a cute girl? Yes but more likely gets saved by a girl. Subara after an embarrassing confrontation with thieves gets saved by our main heroine for Emilia. Subaru tries to help Emilia in return but sadly dies. When Subaru dies however he gets brought back to a point in the past and is forced to relive his death unless he can find some way to stop what is going to kill him and other characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole gimmick of the Re: Zero is that Subaru experiences the worse of the world he now resides in and has to repeat/suffer through it until he can find a solution. The story is at most dark through scenes of pure shock value and despair. At times the story can be good with everyone in good spirit only to be followed by more despair then before. The story can be at time too dramatic for its own good and feel a bit forced. Unlike the production of \u201cAkame Ga Kill\u201d, White Fox did not severely rush this series in its final episodes a stuck to balanced pacing. The one thing I hated about the story is that when it ended I just wanted there to be more as the ending did not satisfy me enough to expect a season two and answer all the questions concerning Subaru\u2019s ability.\\n\\n\r\nWhen talking about the characters Of Re: Zero I will take note of this popularity pole Crunchyroll had a week before the last episode. Out of 20000 people the pole had certain characters voted in a top 5 as favourites so I guess I will talk about these characters since so many people love them apparently (sinisterly chuckles). Beatrice was the 5th most popular character among fans more than likely Crunchy Roll is popular with lolicons, so I guess I nothing much to say here other than she likes animals more than humans since I did not find anything too complex about them. The fourth most popular was Emilia our main heroine. Emilia is a half elf with silver hair who has lived a live troubled by the fact she looks like an evil witch that once tried to cause mayhem in the world. Although you got to like Emilia she is likely the character that will be the most different in every time loop. In the first one her character and perspective of Subaru is different because of how much he interacted with her in that loop. Her position in the world makes it hard for her to interact with Subaru in later arcs which makes her impact as heroine have little effect in the episodes after the first arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe Third most popular character in that Poll was actually Emilia\u2019s spirit cat Puck which likely has to do with the fact that the internet loves cats thus his obvious popularity. It would more than likely have to do with the fact that puck can be an absolute savage when he wants to be and is prone to trolling with Subaru. The second most favourite character of that Poll was actually Subaru believe it or not despite all the hate I see for him all over the interwebs talking about how he is a trash character. I see Subaru as Jackass \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 (the dark hand of re zero hate has vanished) \u2026\u2026\u2026.. But I kind of like the fact he is a jackass \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(Cyborg_Dragon just died a result of his heart exploding)\u2026.(Cyborg_Dragons Ghost will continue writing the review).\\n\\n\r\nAs a bit of a Jackass myself I will have to say I like Subaru more then I hate him despite being a huge problem for health insurance firms everywhere. Despite getting butchered he was able for a while to not let pain of dying get to him and tries and stays humorous. The only point I did not like his Character was around episode 14 where he seemed selfish and acted on instinct. I he is not the best character but I have seen a lot of characters in anime that where so bad they can make a characters like Subaru look like the second coming Jesus. The most popular character amongst fans was Rem the maid who works with Subaru at Roswaals mansion.  Despite being classified as a minor character they are likely the character with the most development in the show and it\u2019s not hard to hate this particular character either considering they are the fan favourite. I really won\u2019t say much else about that character since it might spoil the show for those who are planning to watch it. In my view they are the most interesting female character in the show.  The characters I had a personal liking to are Roswaal whom makes Subaru his B$tch which is pretty funny and Wilhelm who is a personification of bad ass.\\n\\n\r\nIn the Art Department the animation is good and fluid. When there are fight scenes between Characters you can expect top quality animation. The whole thing is very colourful and in the gore department there is more than you would see in the other popular anime out there. The character designs are the most imaginative yet generic for a fantasy world. The only one to stand out is Subaru who is wearing a tracksuit making it seem as if he is that one guy at an anime convention that did not dress up. The special effects such as explosions and magic are pretty and shiny like you would find in a high budget anime by a studio like White Fox.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the sound department. In terms of Music you have the catchy openings with interesting visuals. The OST can be mixture of music that can have a dark vibe or a happy vibe. I was not a big fan of the ending themes as they did get me to keep listening and I ended up skipping them for the after credit scene each episode. I would like to talk about the voice actors as they seemed greatly picked to produce the emotion. Subaru VA Yuusuke Kobayashi was picked apparently because he naturally sounded like a Jackass to the director of the anime which tells you what was targeting when picking actors to fill the voice roles.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all if you somehow stuck to here then you can tell I liked the show or you could just tell that by looking at the score.  \\n",

Never saw something like this. This is literally a masterpiece. Some people might not agree, but when I watch an anime, I just don't \"watch\" it, I feel every fudging moment. Natsuki Subaru is like some god human overlord with super powers, what the fudge iseven going on in this anime, magic and stuff. Telepathy, dark magic, illusions. What kind of person would the author of this story be. Is he some kind of magician or something?\\n\\n\r\neh, dark cults praising a witch \"for the love\" or something like that lol. I wouldn't be surprised if the witch would be some kind of cute girl and all the pain and suffering is basically in the head of all the people wanting her love. Maybe the witch is a really kind girl or something, and when they die it's basically their negative energy in their brains and they eventually destroy themselves because the witch is so kind they can't handle it, the witch cult probably saw her or something and wanted to help her maybe :) but they couldn't handle it :)\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the witch is not such a bad witch, maybe she's cute :3, maybe natsuki subaru will fall in love with the \"witch\" :o, who knows this anime can go every direction.

            "content": "WARNING RANT ALERT SKIP PAST THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IF NOT INTERESTED\r\nNow honestly I could very well be biased as I write this but, It just appears to me that people's reasons to dislike this series tend to be redundant. Unnecessary plot progression is the reason some of you have the attention span of a monkey on drugs...Some don't even comprehend using death as a plot device for character development and proceeds to dismiss it as \"groundhog day\". Now look i'm not bashing anyone's opinion, if anything I encourage people to be vocal about their opinion's. However I feel as though people are rating this seriespoorly mainly cause it was hyped up to a point where it didn't reach their expectations...\\n\\n\r\nRANT OVER CONTINUE HERE\\n\\n\r\nSo after that rant let's get down to why you're really here. Re:Zero is proclaimed by many to be the best of it's season and even the best of the year. Re:Zero has also taken one of my spots of favorite anime. And I'm gonna give you a few reasons as to why that is.\\n\\n\r\nStory(10)\\n\r\nThe story is very simple and it's even been done before. A normal shut-in boy who is transported from his normal world to a fantasy like world. He is then given the power to return by death. A main complaint is there isn't much explanation to why he was transported there, or what his purpose for being there is. However I think that adds to the mystery and allows you to theory craft. This is why I believe people who want answers right away have the attention span of a monkey...\\n\r\nThe story like i said isn't all that new, however it has a presentation that feels fresh. The execution makes you feel for the MC as he goes on his journey. It makes you think about how you would handle his situation, if you were in his shoes.\\n\\n\r\nArt(10)\\n\r\nNow Re:Zero has an impressive Production value. The lighting, the art, and the sound animation come together to produce some of the most beautiful scenes this year. \\n\\n\r\nSound(9)\\n\r\nThe music served its purposed, however it does tend to go unnoticable...When the openings and endings did play they were great overall. Pleasant to the ear and matched the overall tone they were trying to achieve.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10)\\n\r\nThe MC is helpless, he's weak, he grows attached easily, he's flawed, and most of all he's developed. He grows as a character, something that series don't seem to know how to do. The way this Light Novel adaptation shits on its predecessors when it comes to the characters, amuses me. \\n\r\nNatsuki Subaru: This man was put through the ringer, I'll tell you that much. Half the time he's trying not to die but once he made bonds with others, he attempts to keep those around him from dying.\\n\\n\r\nEmilia: The heroine of the series (you'd hardly think that around episodes 13-20). Emilia is the first character that truly interacts with Subaru(Duh she's the heroine xD). She's a half elf that is discriminated against because of the Jealous witch named Satella(I will get to her in a sec). Emilia is a character that was overshadowed by another character that more screen: Rem\\n\\n\r\nRem: Rem was \"waifu material\" around episodes 15-20 then she took her leave after all the screen time she was given...Everything that she has done for Subaru will be set in stone and go on to cement her place as best female character of the year\\n\\n\r\nSatella: Satella is the end game villain and it's very apparent that she is the reason for the MC being in this world in the first place. She has been mentioned in almost all the episodes atleast once. The subtle foreshadowing is also hard not to mention...We can only hope to see who Satella is and what her purpose is...\\n\\n\r\nThat's only if we receive a season 2\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10)\\n\r\nFor me this series is going to be hard to beat. It really took thriller to a new level and at the end had me wishing for a season 2. The writing was above average, and as an adaptation it passes with flying colors. Objectively speaking this series is sound...Imo it's the best this year. As you can see by my rating I wrote purely out of my opinion xD  \\n\\n\r\nOverall(10)\\n\r\nThis series has become one of my favorites of all time...and I hope for a season 2 soon \\n\\n\r\nQuick Review (Objective RTG)\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOVR: 9\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great visuals\\n\r\n+Above average animation\\n\r\n+Good world building\\n\r\n+Impressive Character Development\\n\r\n+Subtle foreshadowing\\n\r\n+Rem xD\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-MC has cringey moments which can be a turnoff \\n\\n\\n\\n",

It's made out of the wet dreams of your childhood. The Main characters exhibit all your sexual, physical and mental desires. They are well developed, to the point where each time you see Subaru's angry face,your sperm turns raw and tastes bitter, like his personality. Now lets look at his relations with the other characters. *SPOILER* he chases the 107 year old Emilia with a 14 year old mental age. Now if we're speaking in legal terms, this is legal age is just but a number. Now his relationship with Rem makes me very salty. If you find someone who treats you like Rem treated Subaru go get that bitch! In our today's society we don't  appreciate the Rems, we blindly chase the Emilias who break our hearts and leave us as sobbing messes. Im rambling at the moment. \\n\\n\r\nThe real bread winner in terms of character is Peltelguese. Mother fucker is \"lit\" (get it)??????

            "content": "I had a blast watching this anime and that is mainly because of how it really lived up to its psychological genre. I haven't seen enough anime that fit the psychological genre enough to critique this particular anime as well as others who have, but I do have to say that it did an amazing job doing so. I enjoyed how they made the protagonist a weakling and how it played into the whole \"travel to another world\" clique of having intense super powers, but this one, none. This really adds a sense of empathy as well as a very high and apparent sense ofrelation to how we may feel if we were in the protagonist's shoes. Pfft I'd doubt if you were transported to an alternative world near identical to that of the typical MMO, that you would instantly know what to do. It was highly realistic in that sense that, no, you don't get super duper over powered POWERS right then and there. But yes, of course, this is my opinion -- now to the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nART - 9/10\\n\r\nI don't know about your guys' standards, but this anime did a good job fulfilling my expectations. Very appealing to the eyes and does a good job maintaining consistency throughout.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 7/10\\n\r\nI mainly mark it down because of the lack of \"appealing\" sounds during action scenes (which I also believe this anime really lacked on). During the beginning of the anime, the sounds were spot on, but as the story progressed, it seems as if they didn't have enough funds to continue it to the end.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 7/10\\n\r\nEven though I may say that the story was fairly complete in the sense that a conclusion was reached, the protagonist could have been build more. What I mean by this is that, him knowing that he's in an alternative world similar to an MMO, he should take advantage of that. I'd understand if the directors/scriptwriters (I don't know what they're formally called) wanted him to remain a weakling for the continuation of relation from the audience, but they really could have expanded on his character. For heck sake he has the ability to do Shadow magic, at least let him learn more debuffs. He had so much potential to just train himself to get even stronger, but it laid to waste.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 9/10\\n\r\nThere was a lot in this anime, honestly. Of course they wouldn't be able to complete it all with the whopping 25 episodes they provided us and I don't blame them at all. They introduced way too much for the anime to cover it all up in one season and knowing this, I am more than content with how they concluded this season. I was also very surprised with how they implemented little \"jump scares\" and the amount of gore in the anime just made the psychological genre pop out even more. From start to finish, it was fairly fluid. It lost me at some parts, but I can say that how they formed the story as a whole was very nice.",

            "content": "Thanks for tuning in to another one of my reviews. This time, under the spotlight is\r\nRe:Starting Life in Another World from Zero, Re:Zero for short.\r\nThis blurb right here is for those who don\u2019t want spoilers and just want to see if they should watch the show or not. Short answer from me: most definitely. This\u2019ll either be a show that will completely engross you or fail to capture even an iota of interest. There are times where people have completed the show and have been ambivalent towards Re:Zero, but those cases are the exception. Try it out, and if you don\u2019t like it at all,move on. No harm done. If you think even a tiny bit that this show might interest you, stick around and get ready for an amazing ride.\\n\\n\r\nNow, from this point forward there will be spoilers, and very heavy spoilers. If you don\u2019t want plot points or the ending leaked to you, turn back now. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a general summary of what I plan to say in the entire review, for those who don\u2019t want to read through the whole thing. This show follows the young man Subaru Natsuki, a typical-yet-kind-of-lame 18 year old teenage male in our modern society, as he experiences both friendship and tragedy in new his life in an unfamiliar fantasy world. Now, the previous sentence was extremely important. Read it over again for good measure. Done? Great. If you actually understood that one sentence, you don\u2019t need to read my review anymore because that\u2019s all I have to say. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero isn\u2019t primarily about friendship, cool powers, ideals, thematic conflict, overarching story, symbolism, or even waifus. Re:Zero is about Subaru, and what he experiences as he tries to live his life in another world from zero. All the people that have been complaining about Subaru\u2019s actions, choices, and characteristics have been voicing their opinions for nothing. You aren\u2019t going to find the ideal protagonist that makes the right choices and has the ability to do everything. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, I can direct you to another young man named Kirito, courtesy of Sword Art Online. Re:Zero is meant to be an anime following an average and relatable character, nothing more and nothing less. If this is the case, what\u2019s so special and fantastic about an anime that just follows this typical-yet-kind-of-lame 18 year old teenage male in a fantasy world? Why watch as your favorite waifu is mutilated and killed five thousand times over because Subaru is too weak to save her? Why endure how frustrating it is to watch Subaru make mistakes and fuck up every single time he comes back from the dead? The majesty of this show comes in the realization that you aren't supposed to be merely \"watching\" Re:Zero. Instead, as a viewer, you are drawn into Subaru's perspective and feel everything that he feels. Did Subaru mess up and have everyone he cares about die in front of his eyes? Subaru\u2019s probably feeling like crap right now, similar to the feeling in the pit of the viewer\u2019s stomach. Did Best Girl Rem just confess her love to Subaru even though he hates himself? Subaru\u2019s probably pretty damn happy to have ReZero\u2019s greatest waifu offer her support to him, and the viewer has been completely smitten by the blue-haired maid. Re:Zero boils down to this: you're on the same train with Subaru and will feel exactly what he feels. That's the magic behind this show: there aren't any other anime that can get viewers this emotionally invested in the characters and plot. The show stays true to itself to the very end, working off your emotions and effectively putting you in Subaru's shoes throughout his journey. \\n\\n\r\nDamn, THAT was the summary? Yup. Moving on to objective analysis of all the different aspects of Re:Zero.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nThe story\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s nothing fantastic either, because the whole show is meant to be following Subaru\u2019s experiences and how he copes with the situations he\u2019s put in. Outside of following Subaru, the plot is generic and shallow, but well executed and smooth.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what to say other than that I think the show looks pretty good aesthetically. I think it\u2019s pretty good art, but to each their own.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI thought the soundtrack was amazing. I extremely enjoy listening to the ending themes and I\u2019ve grown to love the second opening. The soundtrack during critical moments in the show only add to the emotional value of certain scenes like Rem\u2019s confession, or Subaru\u2019s confession to Emilia at the very end. Having voice actors sing is always a plus. Keep in mind that like the art, soundtrack is something very difficult to conduct an objective overview of, even if you are a musical expert. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nRe:Zero introduced a decently large cast of characters and pulled it off excellently. Though some characters did not receive as much development as others, this is easily explained by the fact that Re:Zero is supposed to be a show that follows Subaru. Because the show is supposed to be from Subaru\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s obvious that Subaru and those that were with him the most received the most development. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was uniquely executed in Re:Zero, again confirming how the show is only supposed to be documenting Subaru\u2019s standpoint. Every single character is introduced as a stranger to Subaru, and they are developed as Subaru gets to know them better. Learning about all the characters in Re:Zero is extremely comparable to actually meeting new people, because we watch from Subaru\u2019s perspective as characters initially skeptical of his identity learn to accept him as a comrade. We also see from Subaru\u2019s perspective how he learns to accept the people he initially butts heads with. Re:Zero makes good use of the Return By Death power to develop characters, as characters are given the chance to react to different scenarios in the same setting. Subaru, along with the viewers, picks up on character behavior and builds character profiles with better accuracy as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the characters in Re:Zero are extremely easy to empathize with because of how human they appear to be. All the characters are shown to make mistakes, get overwhelmed, and feel strong emotion. As entertaining as it is to watch Goku and Saitama, it is a wholly superior experience to be able to stand alongside characters that are tangibly human in their behavior and their traits. This is where Re:Zero does us good: it provides a relatable perspective with Subaru\u2019s point of view and introduces very human characters that we can form meaningful connections with. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI was just as skeptical and confused with Re:Zero as everyone else was, until I realized that the show\u2019s primary goal is to give the viewer a perspective into the world of Re:Zero from Subaru\u2019s eyes. After this revelation, I really started to appreciate subtleties in Re:Zero that I wouldn\u2019t have noticed otherwise. Return By Death, killing important characters, and Subaru\u2019s mediocrity is all explained by the fact that the show is created let the viewers live through Subaru\u2019s perspective. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nRe:Zero\u2019s ability to accurately project Subaru\u2019s feelings into the viewers makes it a very impressive anime, if not the only of its kind. With characters that are easy to get attached to, a world that one can just get lost in, amazing OST, and complementary visuals, Re:Zero gets a 9/10. Its lack of a concrete story outside of following Subaru\u2019s point of view and lack of a concrete resolution at the ending stops it from earning a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThis show\u2019s greatest strength, and the reason why I enjoy it so much, is how powerfully it can make viewers empathize with Subaru. Even people who hate Subaru probably found themselves in his shoes, feeling bits of regret and guilt when he was unable to deal the Witch\u2019s Cult and arrived at the mansion to find Rem, Ram, Petra, and Emilia\u2019s bloodied corpses. Even people who prefer Rem over Emilia probably found a little bit of happiness during Subaru and Emilia\u2019s special scene at the end. This has been the first and will probably be one of the only times where an anime has been able to communicate such strong and complex feelings to the viewers on a consistent basis and throughout each episode. It\u2019s as if watching this show lets you Start Life in Another World from Zero. *cue Styx Helix*",

            "content": "RE:ZERO KARA HAJIMERU ISEKAI SEIKATSU\r\nOn reading the synopsis, the first thing that came to mind was konosuba's semi-lighthearted RPG setting. I couldn't have been more wrong. Re zero tells the story of a young man transported from his uneventful world to a medieval time where despite his powerlessness and helplessness he strives to prove himself worthy of receiving the love of his life's affection. Armed with only the ability to \"continue from a saved point\" whenever he dies (returns by dead), he faces his new world.\r\nThe art quality and sound tracks were awesome. The opening and ending songs  were in perfect harmony with thisanime's theme. \"Paradisus-Paradoxum\" by MYTH & ROID was in my view a perfect prototype of how OP theme songs should relate with their stories. Alongside stunning visuals and concepts, the music was almost hypnotic.\\n\\n\r\nThe story-line was good but character development was impeccable. Our main character although brash and indecisive was portrayed as definitely human. He showed that in hard times we can be crushed under the weight of our burdens but not without also showing how possible it is to rise to the occasion. The supporting characters were also well colored characters which each having a personality that made them unique and add to plot.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, REZERO might mess with your psyche a bit, but it is definitely worth watching. Hopefully there would be a second season.",

            "content": "With hyped up shows like Re:Zero, two types of people tend to write reviews for the anime:\r\nThose who loved it so much they can't acknowledge its flaws, and those who disliked it and want to rant on and on to go against the hype, even if that means they end up ranting about the most trivial things and then use that as an excuse to give the show a 3. \r\nReally, Re:Zero isn't about the anime itself, it tells a bigger story beyond what you watch on the screen. \r\nRe:Zero is about ourselves. We need to look deeper into ourselves to truly understand this anime.\r\nYousee, this anime gives us a protagonist who ends up acting cool in the beginning, and attempts to save the day. \\n\\n\r\nSpoiler: His big secret is that he returns to life, you'll find that out a few episodes in. \\n\\n\r\nSlowly as the series goes on, Subaru, the protagonist, has his mind gradually broken due to the intense trauma he undergoes. Don't bother asking people on MAL to try and empathize and understand the stress he's going through, they'll just dismiss it as being \"edgy\" and consider Subaru to be one of the worst protagonists of all time. It's hopeless to ask someone to consider another person's viewpoint. People would rather judge Subaru from a comfortable, safe position, imposing completely unrealistic standards on him for a teenager going through a complete reality change and levels of physical, mental, and emotional stress beyond anything anyone can imagine. \\n\\n\r\nI still recall the time Subaru had his one selfish moment, after saving everyone multiple times throughout the story and getting treated like dirt, where 90% of the MAL community betrayed him. I wonder how many people went from liking him, to disliking him, and then probably ended up liking him at the end of the series? It's almost as if one moment of weakness doesn't make a person, or in this case a character, complete trash. \\n\\n\r\nWith that, we've exposed our own inability to be tolerant of other people's mistakes.\\n\r\nWhat other deep meaning shall we find within this series?\\n\\n\r\nOur tendency to go along with lackluster results. Look at all these people giving this series a 10:\\n\r\nDoes anyone really think this series deserves a 10?\\n\r\nNow, I understand we all have our personal preferences, but are we really going to remain satisfied with Emilia as a character?\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who haven't watched the series, Emilia is the main love interest and she is extremely bland and disappears after the beginning parts of the series until the very end. During all of Subaru's character building she is basically no where to be found, and is largely useless for the majority of the series. It wouldn't be so bad, except she is constantly seen as Subaru's \"superior\", though it's largely Subaru's fault. I would be much more open to the idea if she wasn't such a bland, undeveloped, cliche and irritating character. \\n\\n\r\nCan anyone really justify Emilia? Can anyone present a valid case as to how she isn't a sub-par character? What makes her special?\\n\\n\r\nWell, for those of you reading this review, you'll get to judge for yourselves after watching!\\n\\n\r\nWith that, my mostly review/rant is over. I really just wanted to yell at MAL for being either completely intolerant, or way too forgiving. I believe a balance is important in life.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the review:\\n\\n\r\nThe story (9) was really good, in my opinion. It's something different and it's told in a well-written manner, with good pacing that keeps everything interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art (8) was decent, as it is with most anime nowadays. Some of the character designs are pretty cute too. Lolis included.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8) is nice and fits the series well. I especially enjoyed theater D by Myth & Roid being added in. \\n\\n\r\nThe character...  I rated a 6 because of Emilia and her role in the story. Hopefully she develops during a season 2, though after that ending... It's probably too late.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment I rated a 9, because even though the ending left me a little dissatisfied, I won't deny that I was really excited each week to see every new episode, and I had a blast following it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rated this series an 8 because I enjoyed it a lot, though I acknowledge it's far from perfect. I hope you all enjoyed this review.\\n",

In my opinion this really a master piece since there is a bit of every genre for everyone. \r\nAction -there's a hell lotta action in this anime and the fights and the magic can get really epic\\n\r\nFantasy - If you in general like elves and magic and shit, this is the shit\\n\r\nThriller - Suspense exists through out the entire anime and you really don't know what will happen next\\n\r\nRomance - Subaru's quite the womanizer, you know ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\\n\r\nAdventure - The scenes change a lot and he travels to a different world\\n\r\nPsychological - There is quite a bit of deceiving in this anime\\n\r\nDrama - Character die, a lot and it makes Subaru sad :(\\n\r\nGory - It has to be said, body parts and stuff like that fly around in this anime preeeetty often\\n\\n\r\nSo in short, this anime has waifus, action, magic, thriller and everything you can imagine. What i also really like about this anime, is that the producers decided to release this as a full season anime. That makes character development and relationships change immensely as the story goes on. They also can express the feelings and the thoughts of the characters to a higher level, making it easier to comprehend the character's actions and speeches. I also like the fact that there are so many different characters in this anime that not only appear once in story and actually have a role in the story line.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I also really liked, is that the main character Natsuki Subaru, is imperfect. In fact he really is a piece of shit, good for nothing, selfish, weak. He actually suffers and makes sacrifices but he works hard to fix his mistakes and thats what I like about him.\\n\\n\r\nSo I really recommend this anime. Really one of the best I've ever seen. If you decide to watch this, have fun and enjoy :)\\n\\n",

Well, this could help you to decide for this anime.\r\nFrom a novel, this anime comes with an a traditional idea for a world of RPGs, magic, animal-people, knights, spirits, etc. But, the protagonist? Oh well, he's more than the average high school student in the wrong world, appearing randomly. \r\nThe story is good, of course because you can't transmit at 100% of accuracy a novel, so maybe if you read it, or gonna do it at the same time of seeing the anime, you gonna get notice about it, but WhiteFox compress you in a way that not only you will get packages of cliffhangers, you gonna get a story well distributed and explained in a certain way.\\n\\n\r\nArt, sound and charas are well developed, specially the sounds, you will memorize certain BGMs or sounds that give the anime its own colors. Art will come so well that it is the perfect partner of the sound and Charas, all have their style and time to appear, so each section of the anime can be full of power, and well, all are super special, so the protagonist can have a good time handling them.\\n\\n\r\nFan of that certain game that give you a pain in the ass dying but you still like it? I can say this give you an air of that game, in a enjoyable and funny way, with the advantage that the protagonist it's free of souls, hehe.\\n\\n\r\nI think that can be all I can give you to give the anime an opportunity, this story is great, so not giving some cliffhanger in advance it's hard but worth it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you feel that this review was useful to you or maybe you don't like it at all, well, for reaching this pint either way, thank you so much and I wish you a good time with the anime!",

So what made this series so famous that it was made into different memes?\r\nFor one, It's not just a time travel anime. It also mixed in fantasy and magic that it soon established its own world. It delivered a story line that kept us wanting for more, mostly because each episode ended with cliffhangers. Also, it makes sure that every return isn't redundant. Despite having the same timeline over and over again, not one episode is the same.\r\nNow let's get that the real highlight of this show: its characters. At first, Natsuki Subarucomes out as your typical average guy. Well, he is one throughout the whole series, but there's a reason why he's like that. He represented humans, in a way that all men fear, break down and are flawed. Just like Subaru, we're not all perfect. We may live in a fantasy world where all things are possible, but that truth will remain. And it's not a bad thing. Being weak and flawed is just part of being human. It's how we respond to it that matters. And when we do, we see a change in ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nDon't wait until you return by death to change something. You can lead the change yourself.

            "content": "I've finished re:zero with mixed feelings. I disliked the start, grew to love it in the middle 15 episodes then after that, it was a bit of a chore to the end. For an anime with a MAL rating of more than 8.7 at the time of this review, I have to disagree with the vast majority of the reviewers then who have been giving this series a 9 or 10.\r\nWhile I think the story is interesting, I just never really identified with the characters. Subaru, the MC, came across as annoying but persistent with no real saving traits apart from his devotion to Emilia.There was woeful development of Emilia, with her going missing for the last third of the series. In fact the character that most time was spent on was Rem during those episodes Emilia was missing. I suspect it was my lack of caring about the core relationships which make me rate this a low 8 to high 7 rather than the 9 I was giving it initially.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, I think the art and sound are absolutely to the standard expected of a 2016 anime with no complaints about the artwork or character design. \\n\\n\r\nIt's just a sense of disappointment that the original mechanic of resetting time became less and less relevant as the story progressed and the absence of meaningful growth and character development held back the final third of the series. I still think it's enjoyable to watch but I cannot rate this in the top 5 of the concluding spring anime for 2016.\\n\\n\r\nAs it stands, my top 4 for this season so far are Shokugeki no soma, alderamin, mob psycho and relife. Re:zero started of average, became really strong then just fell away at the end.",

            "content": "*Disclaimer: Admittedly, the ideal way to read this theme rant is by having an experience with the full show in mind. Hopefully, this isn't much of a problem. With that out of the way, let the destruction begin!*\r\nThe more I think about Re:Zero, the more infuriating it becomes. 2016\u2019s mainstream anime zeppelin is an overhyped sham! It shot for the stars, gave up halfway, and settled for firey Venus. It had a lofty goal of delivering a message to the audience about their habits, but amidst the laughable, self-indulgent torture of its main character and neat-looking \u201cdirecting tricks\u201d, it was too scared to commit. It\u2019sThe Last Jedi of anime, except even worse. Both start off harmless enough but by the end divulge into a mess, except I resent this show more.\\n\\n\r\n So, what did Re:Zero attempt to tell us? To find out, you\u2019d need to understand the main protagonist. Wanna know why you hated him? It\u2019s because he was meant to represent you, the entitled audience who escapes life by inserting yourself into fantasy. You who feels entitled to a 2D anime girl of your choice because you think you understand life and the scenarios of any given genre of fiction. He is an attack, a satire on the self-insert, as well as a twisted reflection of the audience, at least for 3/4 of the show. You see, after the infamous confession scene in episode 18, he stops being antagonized or treated as someone who just doesn\u2019t get things. Now he suddenly is smarter and less desperate than he\u2019s ever been; now he\u2019s going to get the girl and help defeat the enemies who caused him immense pain earlier. Now he\u2019s easier for you to insert yourselves into, and now he is suddenly cool with many of the people who felt disgusted or annoyed by him. He lost the one thing going for him, the one thing that made him better than the rest of the cast. He has now become the self-insert he was created to mock.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say they did a remotely good job to begin with. For one, there are moments in which after the mildest of trial and error, he suddenly knows how to solve any given situation. Afterwards, everyone around him who hated or otherwise didn\u2019t care much for him is suddenly cool, but on a smaller scale. Look no further than the end of the second arc, with the now iconic Rem turning from hating Subaru and wanting him dead, to loving him with the passion of a yandere, in the span of an episode, solely based on him helping her survive even when bleeding badly himself. I get that this is a noble action and that if you hated someone and he did that for you, you\u2019d likely rethink your position on that person, but Rem becomes an entirely different character in the span of one scene!\\n\\n\r\nThey do still give Subaru the most painful wake-up call in recent years, but often through contrived means that are poorly resolved. The payoff of Subaru realizing his mistakes, adapting, and improving never hits, as even with his blood sweat and tears, it's never truly earned. After the relentlessly awful gauntlet of middle episodes, after their insulting attempts at shaming Subaru through pathetic \u201caesops\u201d and punishments characters inflict that are contradictory to their nature, as well as one of the most horseshit plot ideas I\u2019ve seen with questionable existence-erasing gas, the show can\u2019t handle it anymore! After all of the headache it put us through, it instead opts to play it as safe as all the Light Novels it went against!\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t even going into other reasons why the writing crumbles faster than Subaru\u2019s mental state, from the pathetic names of some of the enemies, to time loops in which certain events that could not possibly play differently or happen at all somehow do (episode 3 has one with a little girl Subaru and his girl Emilia helped out previously), or how people know the smell of the underlying threat of this series --Satella, the jealous witch-- despite how they never saw her or smelt her. This isn\u2019t even bringing up the laughable excuse of a finale, the hideous fight sequences and CGI, or how horrendously defined the checkpoint system truly is. The lack of remotely decent side characters and character designs wasn\u2019t taken into account either, though to add, the cast is less interesting than even SAO's, and the villain is laughably horrid. The merits regarding the opening/ending themes and some of the visuals were left off the table as well. This is ultimately a cursory glance at the show's mishandling of its promised message and themes rather than a holistic look at the show's folly. As it stands, Re:Zero was only remotely respectable in its initially shoddy mediocrity, not when it laughably abandoned all pretenses of bravado.\\n\\n\r\nCare to Re:Set for us, Re:ZERO?",

I stumbled upon Re:Zero which claimed to have a similar time-leaping gist accompanied with raving reviews and a passionate fan base... and I am extremely glad I did! This anime is undoubtedly the closest anime I could find which resembles the gem that is Steins:Gate. The story revolves around Natsuki Subaru, your average delinquent teenager who is thrown from a grocery store to an alternate fantasy world. During thecourse of this anime you feel an immense sense of courage from the main protagonist as he constantly reverses the gory events of the present in a desperate struggle to save his endangered loved ones. The writers do a remarkable job of building a strong relationship between the viewer and the characters in such a short number of episodes- not to mention the crisp and crystal-clear animation which makes it an absolute joy to watch. The anime also features generous quantities of comedy throughout and even a touch of romance- if that's your thing.\\n\\n\r\nI truly recommend anybody to watch this anime, I feel that it can appeal to a vast audience and it will definitely be worth your valuable time. Although, if you've watched and enjoyed Steins:Gate, I won't give you the choice- Re:Zero is a must-watch!",

The plot was meaty but delivered with consideration, allowing each individual episode to feel important. Furthermore, the pace was upbeat and consistent, maintaining a dramatic feel. If I were to nitpick, the use of gore may have been at times excessive.\r\nArt 8/10\r\nThe art was fresh and crisp, while the animation was well executed. The character designs were exceptional and original. What could have been improved on, however, was that somefight scenes lacked dynamism.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe OP was pleasant but what really stood out were the 2 EDs and the OST. They were top notch, and fit in very well with the corresponding scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nSubaru Natsuki had fantastic development throughout the course of the 25 episodes. Re:Zero does a superb job of drawing out his emotions, which felt genuine. Rem also had first-class depth, with a considerable amount of time focused on her. An important note would be that none of the \"important\" characters felt nondescript, which is commendable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nThe engaging pace, coupled with ever-changing scenarios, proved for a wholly enjoyable watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nAs much as I detest giving out 9s and 10s, even more so to hyped animes, Re:Zero deserves it, and I would definitely recommend it.",

            "content": "So there is re:zero , The best anime in 2016 in many people's opinion . There is a big but though it isn't an awesome show or one that you experience anything new in , it's a typical anime with a plot that has more plot holes than it has plot . On the basis that a second season isn't announced yet the show lacks in it's story the most , there are lot's of characters that were in first half of series that weren't even mentioned in the other half and one of them was Beatrice my favorite . You'll have no idea whatpurpose these characters had in the series just some random stuff thrown in and mixed together and believe me there are lots of them . if we get passed the story which sucked there are the other aspects of the show , first there is the sounding part which I must say by far is it's best one . not only the opening and ending which are absolutely stunning but the background music is really good too even if the show was bad the sound was so perfect you couldn't not like it . Then there is the graphics , it's a 2016 graphics which is really good but not perfect compared to same time aired animes but still as I said it is really good and there is the enjoyment the score I gave re:zero was mostly because of its enjoyment although the show lacks in many aspects but it is made in a way that you are curious about the next episode which was kinda disappointing after ep 25 as you see that nothing gets resolved but the feeling to wait eagerly for sth to come out in a week and watch it is not sth we see a lot these days . And about the characters i must say they did a pretty good job except the show needed more than 50 eps to resolve things and the way it is now most of the characters except the main ones well ... suck . you see someone in 1-2 episodes and that's it it never gets mentioned again or anything . And at last the show may be 2016s best anime but it is absolutely not the best anime you have seen .",

            "content": "Isekai anime tend to be fairly common these days, so it takes more than the generic execution to get people\u2019s attention. This year we\u2019ve seen plenty of isekai anime this year that managed to stand out from the rest. KonoSuba took the premise in a more light-hearted way and Grimgar took it in a realistic way. Re:Zero decides to take this Isekai premise and give it a darker and more edgier turn. Focusing on a protagonist who gets sent to an alternate world, where is only ability is to be sent back in time after experiencing death, and how he manages to use his abilitiesto save others. Re:Zero doesn\u2019t take long to showcase its unique take and style and it manages to become one of the best Isekai anime out there. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, Re:Zero\u2019s entire premise basically revolves around our protagonist, Natsuki Subaru, and gets teleported to an alternate world and has the ability of going back to a \u201ccheckpoint\u201d every time experiencing death. However, the story focuses less on how Subaru got in this situation, and more on what he does with his situation. The story itself is made up of three arcs, with the third arc being the majority of the series. Each arc has its own main problem, but the overall story is what ties them together. Not many questions get answered by the end of this series, since the story is still incomplete in its web novel series. But this is a problem with most adaptations of ongoing light novels/manga. Each story is well written and they balance out its lightheartedness with tragedies. The story primarily focuses on how Subaru handles these situations and how much despair is weighing him down.  Though not all of the third arc is adapted as its tragic end is left untouched for the sake of a more \u201cpleasing ending\u201d, but the series manages to loyally adapt its source material well. Although some key plot moments are cut down, but they will only affect the arcs after where the anime leaves off at. \\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nThe thing that impresses me the most is how dedicated White Fox is in making this adaptation a good. Most episodes have their OP and EDs cut out because the studio wanted more time for adapting more content. That being said, the studio definitely needed that extra time. The adaptation covers 9 volumes in 25 episodes (except for the last bit of volume 9), which is quite a lot for an anime to cover. Some moments are cut out, but at least the key plot points are kept. However, the pacing is a little bit uneven throughout the series, particularly during the third arc. It might have been better if the second arc had a faster pace and the third arc had more episodes to work with. But the directing in the series is solid. The cinematography and its style is great. The series isn\u2019t always depressing and disturbing as it has its lighthearted moments here and there (particularly during the first half of the series). The second half of the series, which consists of the third arc, is much more darker, edgier and action-packed. One key issue in Re:Zero is the lack of world-building. The writing focuses more on establishing its characters more than its setting, making this alternate world feel bland. Many features of this world is only brought up when relevant, just for the sake of plot progression. And sometimes it feels like the series is making up stuff along the way, when in reality, they might have just crammed exposition just to get the story moving. This doesn\u2019t happen to often though, but when it does, it can be a bit distracting.\\n\r\nPresentation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe characters are what are the selling point for this series so if you don\u2019t end up liking them, chances are that you\u2019re not going to like the anime much. Natsuki Subaru\u2019s a somewhat unique protagonist, but he\u2019s isn\u2019t quite memorable. Don\u2019t get me wrong, his character is handled well, but it\u2019s just that its hard to be as emotionally invested with him as let\u2019s say some other tragic protagonist like Okabe from Steins;Gate. But he is likable though. His cheerful, yet careful attitude is fun to see and when tragedy falls on him, his breakdowns are even more amusing. His character changes out throughout the series. Even though it may seem sudden, his character change wasn\u2019t really a character change to begin with. He was just expressing his true feelings more. The main female protagonist of the series, Emilia, is a likable character, but she isn\u2019t anything special. Mainly because she was written without any flaws makes her a character hard to connect to. However, she doesn\u2019t play a major role in the third arc, which leaves her appearance at the end lack impact. Rem, who plays a major role in the third arc, happens to be the most complex character of the series. Her leniency might be a little too much, but her dedication is likable. Her sister, Ram, is also a pretty good character, despite not being in the series much. There are a bunch of other supporting characters in the series and many of them are handled pretty well. \\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art style of the series isn\u2019t the most unique, but the art quality is definitely neat and pretty. There are moments when landscapes and backgrounds look gorgeous and the character designs are really good too. One thing the anime manages to excel on is its lighting. During pivitol moments, the lighting adds the emotional impact it creates. However, the art quality isn\u2019t always very consistent. There are quality drops in some moment, particularly in the second half of the series. As a matter of a fact, the second half of the series pales in its art when compared to the much well-drawn first half. But even during art quality drops, the backgrounds tend to stay consistently good-looking.\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nDespite its fantasy genre, Re:Zero isn\u2019t that action-packed. There are fights during the climaxes of each arc, but other than that, there\u2019s not many moments where they can showcase their animation quality. But there are moments when sakuga animation is used, but surprisingly, they are used for the emotional scenes, rather than the action-packed one. Moments when characters cry in a sense of happiness, has a very smooth feel to it and makes the scene more impactful. However, the animation quality in general isn\u2019t very consistent. Its most well animated fight happens in the first arc of the series and the fights after that tend to look a bit clunky. The third arc in particular had some weird looking moments. But even during the third arc, the emotional and dramatic moments had solid animations. \\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe main cast of Re:Zero is actually voice acted by seiyuu who haven\u2019t done much before. However, they all manage to do an impressive job, despite their experience. Kobayashi Yuusuke may have done not much before, but after doing a character like Subaru, I\u2019m sure he will have lots of opportunities later on. Before doing Re:Zero, he was known mostly for his role as Arslan, but now he\u2019ll be known for doing Subaru. Not only does he manage to get his character\u2019s carefree tone right, but during his tragic moments, he does a great job in showing how much his character is suffering. Whenever Subaru breaks down, it really sounds real. And there\u2019s a moment in both the beginning of episode 7 and the end of episode 23, where the seiyuu shows his amazing range in voice acting. Takahashi Rie, who created her popularity with Megumin from KonoSuba, manages to do a good job as Emilia. Her script doesn\u2019t ask for much, but she does what she needs to do well. Minase Inori, whose been doing a lot of \u201cbest girl\u201d characters recently (and \u201cworst girl\u201d characters), does a great job as Rem. She showcases both a strong and emotional side to her character. But the seiyuu who amazed me the most in Re:Zero is Matsuoka Yoshitsugu. He deserves every praise for his role as the main antagonist of the third arc. Seriously, if your hating the guy only because he did some generic characters, that\u2019s his scripts fault, not his. He delivers in every single role he does, and as Petelgeuse, he does the role of his life. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nWhat seemed to grab my attention the most when I first watched Re:Zero was its splendid music. But it\u2019s not just the background music that\u2019s good, but also its OPs and EDs. The first OP, \u201cRedo\u201d, is really catchy and upbeat and gets the tone of the first two arc right. Not to mention that Suzuki Konomi is a great singer. MYTH & ROID does the first ED and the second OP and they are some of the best I\u2019ve heard. The ED, \u201cSTYX HELIX\u201d, is very unique and mysterious and it\u2019s simply put, one of the best EDs I\u2019ve ever heard. The second OP, \u201cParadisus-Paradoxum\u201d, is also just as good too. The second ED, \u201cStay Alive\u201d, is done by Emilia\u2019s seiyuu and it\u2019s fairly good, but the first ED was much better. MYTH & ROID also did two insert songs for the anime, and both are excellent. \u201ctheater D\u201d is what stands out the most. But the background music in Re:Zero is also good, particularly the mysterious pieces. \u201cThe Witch's Call\u201d, \u201cPrelude to an Impulsion\u201d, \u201cHexentanz\u201d, and \u201cTakt of Heroes\u201d in particular are really good. \\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nRe:Zero was probably one of the most enjoyable anime of the year; not just to watch, but also to discuss about\u2026 well, except for the waifu wars. But its unique take on the isekai trope and giving it a darker feel makes this stands out not only in anime of the same genre, but anime in general too. It\u2019s got its issues here and there, but overall it\u2019s pretty fun. Re:Zero is at its best when it plays cruel, since the selling point of the series for most people is the suffering aspect of the series. Time travel stories don\u2019t come out very often, so it\u2019s always nice to see more of that. Add some fantastic voice acting and even more fantastic music, and you\u2019ve got yourself an enjoyable anime. Now, your enjoyment will heavily rely on your tolerance for the protagonist and how you interpret his change, but if you look at it in a positive aspect, all should be fine. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Re:Zero is definitely worth checking out if you haven\u2019t already. Chances are that you\u2019ve heard about this anime already and know what it\u2019s about. It may be too dark and edgy for some, and it has flawed and confused characters who don\u2019t always make the right choice, but it handles its tone and style well. Even if the production values remain inconsistent, its voice acting and music is always on point. You won\u2019t get a definitive conclusion with this series since the web novels are ongoing, but it wraps up its arcs well, despite not covering the entirety of the third arc. But definitely check out this series, even if it\u2019s just because of the hype. Maybe you like it, maybe you won\u2019t, but Re:Zero managed to be one of the most discussed anime of the season for a reason. \\n\\n\r\n+ A unique, darker and edgier take on the \u201cisekai\u201d trope and handles it neatly.  \\n\r\n+ Well-directed, especially during the more emotional and darker moments.\\n\r\n+ Great OPs, EDs, insert songs and fantastic background music.\\n\r\n+ Ridiculously amazing voice acting from Matsuoka Yoshitsugu and Kobayashi Yuusuke does wonders too.\\n\r\n- Inconsistent production values and pacing makes this a somewhat bumpy ride\\n\r\n- Lack of world-building makes the overall setting feel uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.3/10",

What this anime excelled in was it's character development for those who mattered within the span of 25 Episodes.\r\nStory and Character:\r\nThis anime is a roller-coaster of emotions. Our MC is an ordinary guy who comes from the modern world, who is then randomly transported to a medieval fantasy world with swords and magic. The story was laid out fairly well, with several occasions not getting enough mention (where certain side characters disappeared to,or what happens in a different time) but the focus is always on the main character, in this case: Subaru. You'd see how he thought and the struggles he has gone through in order for him to even stay alive. \\n\r\nIn the course of the anime you begin to share his pain in his struggles at every twist and turn. Since is only a 25 episode anime, full details regarding anyone apart from the Main characters were understandably left out. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\r\nThe Art of this Anime is rather average considering the rising quality within the industry, but still has some great action and effects which don't make your head go for a spin. The Soundtracks of Re:Zero like any anime play a big part in storytelling, the music and sounds here being well on queue to help you maintain a connection to the  scene presented in front of you.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Say:\\n\r\nI overall enjoyed the whole anime, there is no episode apart from the first maybe, which got me to tune out for a single moment. Unsure of whether this series gets a second season or not, it is safe to say they ended off the series fairly well and can come back to finish it at any time.\\n",

However if you don't - please watch it till the end.\r\nPicturing Subaru I'm not sure if he is a positive hero or a badass here. At least if you make it till the end, you need to think over it twice. Usually I never doubt if an anime main character is positive, badass or anything like that. But having main character playing hero, while meantto be badass later is something new to me.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime, if you're into psychological stuff mixed w/ action.

            "content": "2016 was the year where we got some amazing new shows like Grimagar and Fantasy, KonoSuba, Tanaka Kun and Flying Witch and in that same year we had too, deal with disappointing too, downright awful shows like Erased, Joker Game, Divine Gate and freaking Big Order which are one the worst things I have ever seen in my life. In spring 2016 we are presented with a fantasy anime with a time travel twist. That anime is Re:Zero.\r\nOut of all the anime that was hyped to, death Re:Zero was the most hyped and talked about anime of 2016.\r\nThe question is does it deserve all thehype? Let's find out\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory.\u00a0\\n\r\nThe story beings with our main lead Subaru who is just living a normal at earth then suddenly he is transported into a fantasy world.\\n\r\nFrom they're Subaru just helps people solve the problems before they start while trying to, survive at the same because if he dies not only he's are immediately brought back too, life but everything that he has done will be rested. Very occasionally there will save points meaning when Subaru gets too, the that certain save point he will die and respawn too, the save point instead you know going back too, the beginning.\\n\r\nAm just going to, be honest with you right now.\\n\r\nThe story is not that good as it doesn't really seem to go anywhere. Some people may say that it makes the story unpredictable but the problem is Re:Zero is not anime original series.\\n\r\nAlso like too, mention the many plot holes that Re:Zero has like how did Subaru get his powers, when did this start, why do some of the characters appear in one minute and all of the sudden they are gone and never seen again throughout the, are they any other consequences when Subaru dies, who is Emilia, What did Subaru do in his past life back on earth and the list goes on and on. It doesn't really make any sense because of Re:Zero like too, throw in new characters that barely do anything in the story.\\n\r\nWorld Building of Re.Zero is okay at best because while the show explores the Kingdom of Lugnica well the other races like the witches, monsters as well of the labing nations, timelines, and the world history are never explained at all. But hey least its better than Akame Ga Kill world building which is nonexistent at all.\\n\r\nAlso, I feel that after episode 18 the show literally becomes rushed in terms of pacing.\\n\r\nUpdate!!!\\n\r\nI have read the visual novel and arc 3 in the novel didn't have this problem but the anime tries too fit almost the entire arc in such small episode number.\\n\r\nOverall I have mixed feeling towards the story in Re:Zero\\n\r\n5.5/10\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nNot going to, lie beside from Rem I found this cast to be either decent too missed potential. They are really not bad characters but I wish they did more with them\\n\r\nSubaru is just an average main protagonist who gets transported into a fantasy world.\\n\r\nNow what I have been told people that he's realistic. He started off kinda realistic but as the series he literally became unrealistic.\\n\r\nMost of the time he's either a whiny bitch or being edgy because of plot sakes.\\n\r\nHe also tries too, be a comedic character but he fails because it was just painful too, watch and it's downright cringe-worthy.\\n\r\nAlso, Subaru can be really emotionally manipulative at times to a point it becomes very annoying.\\n\r\nIf they're any positives with Subaru at all that would be the character development. Yes, he actually a decently developed character because I like how he always project characters like Rem and Emilia from danger.\\n\r\nOverall Subaru is a mediocre character at best and subpar at worst.\\n\\n\r\nNow we have are Rem\\n\r\nNow she is the character that I really liked from start too, finish.\\n\r\nI liked how she always supported Subaru even when she sacrifices herself for Subaru. Also, her back-story is well told and it explains why Rem became the person that she is.\\n\r\nShe the only character in this series that has real character development because Subaru character development for the most part just exists too, move the plot.\\n\r\nOverall Rem is one hell of an amazing character and easily the best thing about Re:Zero.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, we have Emilia.\\n\r\nShe is the most wasted potential character in this show for me.\\n\r\nShe started off strong with a very likable person but as the series progresses she was out was completely out picture due to lack of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were decent I guess.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed characters like Felt, Reinhard and Felix for been interesting and enjoyable characters.\\n\r\nAlso, the villains were not that good at all.\\n\r\nOverall this character cast could have been better.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation.\\n\r\nIf you guys can\u2019t tell the art of Re:Zero is great and very appealing too, the eye with a nice and smooth color usage from the backgrounds/scenery too, the color of the character designs.\\n\r\nAlso the character designs were also great and they fit with the setting of Re: Zero\\n\r\nStudio White Fox really has outdone themselves with the animation because it's very smooth and constant in both the action and drama scenes.\\n\r\nOverall I like the art and animation here.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe OST for Re:Zero is good but I wasn't a fan of any of the tracks.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening was just wonderful too, listen easily the second best thing about Re:Zero.\\n\r\nThe second opening is just mediocre too, be honest.\\n\r\nThe first ending is wonderful too, listen and in general very relaxing. This ending theme is iPod worthy.\\n\r\nSame goes for the second ending theme of the series\\n\\n\r\nAs this time of the review, there's no official dub for this show.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nRe:Zero is a fun but flawed show.\\n\r\nWhile I kinda liked in the beginning but as the series progresses the show literally falls apart big time.\\n\r\nWhile the setting was nice, the openings/endings and Rem were good. The story was mediocre and too short for its own good, decent worldbuilding, characters range from\u00a0good to miss potential, great visuals and a nice ost and great voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this show is decent at best and wasted potential at worse.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 5/10",

            "content": "Re:Zero is a show that tries to respin some old formulas, succeeding in many ways but also pissing off fans who want their fanservice done right.\r\nThe two devices driving this show are \"lost in another world\" and \"time loops/reset points\", and as such the basic formula proceeds with each episode containing some trial-and-error as protagonist Subaru dies gruesomely to various foes and hazards he could not have anticipated, and after multiple attempts he eventually finds a route to navigate all of them safely and accomplish his goals.\r\nSubaru is the main character, but is also more of a plot device than a well-characterized figure. His actionsand awareness are all over the place; sometimes he looks like a genius, other times a hopeless harem-style protagonist. In the last third of the show a major development moment is shown that changes his basic outlook into a more confident, collected and determined main character, but it also has the effect of making him more one-dimensional, which is a complaint common to most of the characters in this story: \\n\\n\r\nThe plotting is driven around creating escalating cliffhanger situations out of thin air, and the characters decide to do things because the plot demands it, rather than because it has been artfully set up. By the conclusion, one gets a sense of progression, but the progression is grounded in abstract themes, not the characters, and since the plot has not really concluded(there's lots more material to adapt) it's not a totally satisfying ending either. The characters are good enough to keep you invested, but not much more, and because the plot jerks them around and occasionally kills them, there isn't smooth consistent gratification in these characters, indeed the author has actively campaigned against your building that kind of relationship to them, so if you just want comfort zone waifus and husbandos, stay away. (90% of the negative reaction to this show is people realizing at some point that they have been deceived and will never get what they want.)\\n\\n\r\nDespite those concerns, the basic formula works. There's plenty of material to keep you guessing. White Fox has done some great work on the adaptation and several of these episodes are downright breathtaking to watch. But go into it looking for a bit more of a literary experience, where the concept and themes dominate the proceedings, even as it makes occasional, surface-level pandering motions.",

Please note that my scores are purely subjective and my own opinion. \r\nStory: (9/10)\r\nI remember reading the synopsis and thinking \"if they execute it the right way, this can either turn out to be one of the greatest anime I'll ever watch. Orone of the the worst,\" and I'm glad it's the former. I found that the author brilliantly executed the \"mechanic\" of Return by Death (noteably in several episodes), and made it very suspenseful and interesting for me to watch every week. (Other people who've seen more \"time-travel\" anime might disagree, but to each their own)\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nHonestly the art was pretty decent, some scenes were genuinely great, but I think I'll need to rewatch it with a focus on the art if I'm to do further commenting on this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nJust listen to it man.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I really want to give this a 9, seeing Subaru grow each week really was an enjoyable and interesting experience for me. But unfortunately because of the way the plot works, it's almost as if though the ONLY character we've seen grow is Subaru. Which is why I'm quite reluctant to give it a 9. But overall, whilst Subaru will make some very frustrating decisions I found him to be a great MC.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhat will I spend my Sundays doing now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nHonestly I'd give Re:Zero around a 8.87 or 8.9 out of 10, I think that in some ways I enjoyed it more than FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Although I really haven't seen the whole story (since it isn't out yet) for me to decide which is better, I'm going to slightly reluctantly say that it's at least on equal footing with FMA, if not a close second or alightly ahead (depending on how it goes).",

ALL of the side characters are extremely well developed with a rare exception of maybe one or two just having wasted potential. you probablywill have a hard time not binging this anime to its extremely well timed and aggravating cliffhangers. the art work is pretty good not great but it is good.\\n\\n\r\nlike i said earlier all of the characters with the exception of the main character are extremely interesting and well written. if your the type of person to love to hate a character subaru is your knight (fore shadowing?). the two main female protagonists are possibly two of the most beloved characters in this show being rem and emilia. the only drawback i think with emilia is we don't get to see as much as we should at certain points which is fine but if there is a second season it would be cool to get more of her. the only reason i don't give this anime a 10/10 in terms of story score is i feel like there is so much more we can build on if we get a second and third season there is so much that can be done with this anime's world and characters. this anime still gets a 10/10 and now i must cry in my sleep waiting for a second season.",

            "content": "Re:Zero is an anime that, as enjoyable as I found it, is rather difficult to recommend without a second thought. A slow start, complex buildup, an incomplete story (thus far), and heavy focus on character development are but a few of the reasons why an appreciative audience may be hard to find. However, with all that being said, Re:Zero does set itself apart as an anime that tries to be different. It goes all-in with everything that it does, and cliches and plot devices that would otherwise seem tacky somehow just work when it comes to Re:Zero, putting together a rather compelling experience if seenall the way through. White Fox's adaptation of the novels is quite well done indeed, right up to the ending of the first season in my opinion, considering the overall tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art quality of this show is definitely above par for the course. It truly shines towards the start of the season, and seems to dip a little towards the middle and the end, but overall, it remains a rather impressive quality. Nothing to write home about; however, some of the fight scenes are very well done and warrant a second watch. The Sound design itself was quite well done as well. I personally didn't find the soundtrack all that memorable, but it works, and doesn't really detract from the overall quality of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story and Characters are what this is all about though, and it certainly builds up over the course of the anime. Now, I did mention that this show isn't for everybody, and I will explain myself here. Re:Zero focuses a lot on the flaws of the main character, until he reaches an almost unbearable level of douchebaggery. We, as the viewers, are expected to surf along with this tide and digest what is happening before us. The tide doesn't turn until more than halfway through the story - heck, it's not until the final third that we finally get a glimpse of the hero that could be Subaru. Another thing that may/will tick people off is the fact that Subaru seems to exemplify the qualities of a deus ex machina. He is dumb when required to be, and suddenly becomes this mastermind, manipulative genius when the occasion calls for it. I know it has to do with the fact that he utilizes new information that he somehow compiles - however, it does feel a bit contrived at times and even I as a person who enjoyed this show, am not entirely sold on this bit. And finally, while this is both a positive and a negative depending on how you view it - this show can be dialogue heavy. In fact, there is an entire episode dedicated to a conversation between two characters. I personally loved that episode, but I can see how quite a few of my friends could care less about why that conversation needed to be that detailed at all. Which makes me realize that this show isn't really for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that Re:Zero has a lot of crazed fans about it, and I can see why. Look past the flaws, and this anime is indeed very, very, good. I'd be lying, however, if I said that I didn't take issue with the existence of said flaws. Yet, the fact remains that this is definitely one of the better, if not the best, animes of 2016. As far as my rating goes, I'd give this a solid 8.6 out of 10. Since MAL lacks a decimal system, and the fact that it's definitely better than an 8, I'll give Re:Zero a 9 for now and maybe revisit this review and update it in the future if need be.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you've been caught up in the hype surrounding Re:Zero, give it a watch. However, be wary of some of the things mentioned above, and be patient with this show if you will. It takes its time and is certainly heavy on the drama, but you might just end up loving (or hating, for that matter) it. Cheers!",

The world picture and the character development are all part of the story, so even if many would perhaps give it a 2-5, that's usually because they don't consider the whole picture. The story isn't some halfbaked thing you can deem as a stand-alone without considering the characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, this whole season can be judged as an opening act, which justifies the very many questions we accumulated from the start, meaning that judging the work as a whole's story right now is by no means fair yet, so lets continue with some of the things we can judge, next!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is seemingly just good, but when you consider what art means in the context of a work with characters, it's not only about making things pleasant to the eye, meaning that we have to look at how the characters are portrayed, how they are portrayed is done by both the art and the sound, but lets focus more on the art aspect here.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was on point with declaring how the characters felt visually, their concerns were indicated, even subtle hints such as eye glances, signs of nervosity such as rubbing the arm, twirling their hair and more got visually shown. Long story short, what had to be shown got shown through the art, nothing more, nothing less, I can't give it the last two points due to not being able to perform beyond perfect, that may be due to my love for detail and the limitation of the artstyle the studio had decided upon, it's still very good. Next!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI didn't experience any problem with the sound, the voice actors managed to portay the characters worries and concerns, eagerness and breakdowns great. In terms of communication, the tone of the voice makes up 30% of our communication with one another while the words themselves makes up around 17% or something (if I'm not wrong, well look it up yourself if you want) and I believe the actors managed to do that great.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other sound which doesn't make up for the voices but the scenery, environment, they managed to fit the anime very well, all these things leads me to have nearly no problem with the sound and therefor I'm giving a 9. Although I need more than what was presented in order to give it a higher grade, but it's not exactly a music anime, so this is good enough. Lets go to the work's best point which is next.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nEvery opening act needs to present its characters more or less, with the limited amount of time they had, they managed to do that excellent. In the first arc he seemed to be under the impression that it was all a dream, that he would wake up any minute as expecting anything else would be pure lunacy given his position, so thus he decided to act as a fool and play along with everything. However with the many situations he got to encounter, even the dullest fool would soon realize that it was nothing short of reality. Natsu Subaru is a character who goes through so much development that it can be difficult to keep track of his mental state if you're not observant enough, especially in the beginning, after the course of these arcs we have witnessed he seem to be becoming more stable after each setback, but to be completely honest, stabilizing after all that is the true insanity as he little by little gives up his values which makes him \"human\".\\n\\n\r\nI think nothing more needs to be said about Subaru, so lets focus at the people in his surroundings instead. The portrayal of how the other characters reacts to Subaru's reaction after a setback is what also makes this show what it is, I can't see any problem with how they are acting, nor how they are developing, they are actually outstanding at that. The more setbacks an arc had, the more I looked forward to how the surrounding characters would react as the smallest misstep would drop their \"value\" in the beholder's eye at once, where about this \"value\" could go by the name \"realism\". All these things allows me to give it a 10 when it comes to characters. Next!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs for the personal experience, I came to look forward to each new episode more than the last for each week that went by, having a 40-60 minute first episode helped immensely to get into the series as well, the frightening aspect is that the 25 episode went by too quick. \\n\\n\r\nThrough the website I viewed everything, I had the luck to enjoy reading long essays about each and every episode, where about these essays were made by a commenter commonly referred to as Essay-kun by the others on the website. I would highly recommend reading his essays of his about each episode if you didn't pick up everything from the episode you watched in question, in order to enjoy the work called Re:zero kara hajimeru isekai seikatsu even more.\\n\\n\r\nI would very much want to see more and I hope you as a reader and viewer would as well. Thus I'm giving it 10/10 on enjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt all accumulates to an overall score of 9/10. Try to come in with a clear mind when watching the anime and try to pick up on all the subtle hints that are laid out everywhere in each and every episode, hopefully you won't go too clueless after watching, ah and keep in mind that it's an opening act and by no means a full story.",

            "content": "Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World\r\nTo long, Didn't read Version: Watch this Anime! It's worth your time investment, that's a promise. \r\nSo people, I'm ashamed and ecstatic to say that I started and finished this show in 2 days (with no sleep). From the first episode it had me hooked and wouldn't let go. The premis at first seemed like your run-of-the-mill mmo \"transported to another world\" style Anime. But then I noticed that this one didn't use the cliche' nerve gear or \"this was gods doing\" entry point. +1 for originality right there dude. Anyways here goes.\r\nStory-10\r\nYou've all probably seen this genre ofAnime before. With shows like Konosuba, Log Horizon, and the infamous Sword Art Online. Fortunately, Re:Zero isn't just another copy and paste. Without spoiling anything, the transition from our MCs' world to his new fantasy world was quick! They didn't waste any time with explanations (which may be a good or bad thing) or even the whole \"lost and confused\" cliche'. Instead our protagonist acknowledges that he has indeed been transported to a new world (with all the Cat-Girls you could want) and sets off on what he believes is his own personal adventure (Little does he know that the world does not revolve around him, instead he just become a cog in a much, much larger machine) \\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\nArt is not my field of expertise, but, I can recognize the difference between Your Name and Berserk 2016. With that I can tell you that this Anime is \"OK\" in the art department. For instance, The first thing I noticed when our MC was swept away and placed in a town square, is that all of the back ground characters have really weird walking animations. That stays persistent throughout the show. The fight scenes are OK. Besides that it's really just average at best. \\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nTo be honest, I couldn't care less about the opening. For me you have to make a great first impression and if it doesn't catch me immediately then I'll skip past it for the rest of the series. That was the case with Re:Zero. Now on the other hand, that ending song! \\n\r\nWhen the singer sang the first two lines she had me. I can honestly say that it takes a lot of epic ness to give me goosebumps, and that's what this did. Along with the soundtrack, it's definitely a 9/10 for me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7 \\n\r\nOkay so the good first. Rem, what'd you think? In all honesty, this is the best female character in any anime I've ever seen. At first you'll be angry with her, then you'll be happy, then sad, and next thing you know your happy-crying like a baby. Rem sent me on a roller coster of emotions and I enjoyed every second of it. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the bad. The MC is great in the beginning (even though he isn't bothered with learning anything about this new world). I genuinely enjoyed watching his encounters and how his optimistic attitude helped him solve the small problems he came across. \\n\r\nBut about half way through I noticed that he was pretty stupid. Once I noticed this it's like the show wanted to show you exactly how dumb he really is. I mean, we're talking about a guy with barley any common sense. It's like everything is always new to him. By that I mean no matter how many times he runs into the same type of problem, he acts like it's his first time dealing with it. This guy couldn't come up with the simplest solution if it was written down for him (and it basically is). As a viewer, I don't enjoy watching a idiot try and deal with problems. If I wanted that I'd watch jersey shore. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are alright. They might even be good but I can't tell when they are in the same anime as Rem.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nI mean it's great dude. What are you waiting for? Mommy to tell you it's Okay? I promise you won't be disappointed. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. There's definitely a lot more that I can say about how great this one is and how you should watch it immediately. But hopefully if you read this post then your convinced. Anyways, thanks for reading and HF!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This anime is the best anime i have ever seen without a doubt. Re: Zero had one flaw in its entirety and that is the fact the checkpoint system for his ability \"return by death\" is very convenient to saving time in the anime. But honestly everyone should be able to look past that.\r\nThis anime did what i thought no anime could, in which it would allow the main character to make choices based on whatwas worth sacrificing. I wish they would have gone to the extreme on this, but hey, cant ask for everything in 25 episodes. The overall stage is not the best described until later, wherein Stein's Gate spent the entire first half dedicated to scene. RE: Zero doesn't focus much on side characters, and because of that, i think people can get detached, but through the main characters experiences, this anime portrays everyone's thoughts and emotions perfectly. I was hooked from the first episode really, and i stayed up all night to finish this anime, which i hadn't done since i watched Guilty Crown. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a 10/10 without a doubt. The story is perfect, and carried through perfectly for what they want to do. The character development is perfect, and carried through perfectly to the end. The art style and sound match the anime perfectly, i don't have any complaints about this anime. Honestly everyone is going to have their preferences in what style of anime they watch, but this is a must watch on my list.",

            "content": "To take Psychological-focused Anime seriously, there has to be a lot of thought put into the world building, script and most importantly character-relations and believability. Of course, no show manages to do so to the fullest, cutting short on some aspects to provide further details for others, giving the show a unique identity. If a series manages to do appropriately well in all these aspects, the viewer is metaphorically able to \u2018dive\u2019 into the fantasy world, character\u2019s psyche and interesting script, making it one of the most enjoyable Genre, at least for me. One that really did almost perfectly at all the mentioned aspects wasMonster, being the pinnacle of Psychological-Anime I\u2019ve seen so far.\\n\r\nComparing Re:Zero to an actually good show of its genre could be described that way: If Re:Zero actually tried to do a header in its own atmosphere, script-quality, and characters, it would immediately bump onto the ground, eventually breaking its back. The show tries to be something deep, while it definitely couldn\u2019t from the start\u2019s premise and overall atmosphere of the first episodes, without a massive shift of tone. At the same time, Re:Zero still tries to entertain as much of the possible audience watching it (basically being a jack of all trades) with implementing several ideas, making it one of the biggest giant messes I\u2019ve seen in the medium and leaving behind a show in a big crisis of identity.\\n\\n\r\nThe mess that the overflow of ideas and the shifts of tone without proper foreshadowing created is almost too much to be covered in one single review. Therefore I\u2019ve decided to structure my review like an FAQ, not because I\u2019m a big retard who is too lazy to think of an actual proper way to structure my text, but rather because I don\u2019t know how to structure my thoughts on this show otherwise. I\u2019ll put a DISCLAIMER here because possible SPOILERS can be encountered when reading this review.\\n\r\nSo then, let\u2019s get started!\\n\\n\r\n> What is this show about? \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Re:Zero is essentially about a former NEET getting transformed into a fantasy world and skirt-chasing every cute female character he meets. Most importantly, he wants to conquer the heart of our main heroine, the half-elf waifu which gets a lot of hate \u2018cause she\u2019s a half-elf waifu (the most hated person and \u2018major antagonist\u2019 of this world being an elf), by wanting to protect her from all dangers. He also helps her to pursue the goal to become a dragon priestess and supports her during the \u2018royal election\u2019, where she is competing with four other top-tier fantasy waifus.\\n\r\nThe plot of Re:Zero is neither story-driven, nor character-driven, but rather \u2018bullshit-driven\u2019. And I\u2019m serious when I say bullshit-driven, the amount of info-dumping without real meaning in certain episodes, promising mysteries behind major characters being solved in the most generic and boring way ever and plot-twists out of nowhere without proper foreshadowing is just too damn high.\\n\\n\r\n> Oh, you\u2019re giving the show a lot of shit there, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re being a little too unfair?\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say that I hated this show from the very beginning, in fact until episode ~15 I had it at a 5.5/10. However, the trainwreck which was about to follow made me absolutely hate the show for the constant shifts of tone. In the first few episodes, I actually found the reset-mechanic in Re:Zero to be kind of refreshing for the \u2018trapped in a fantasy world\u2019 kind of setting, even though the beginning of the story (basically Subaru being transformed) was kind of stupid. Nevertheless, I was able to cope with it, because the show didn\u2019t make a big fuzz about our former NEET Subaru is just skirt-chasing the first cute girl which is introduced in the series. He eventually ends up being killed off in several episodes in an overly gory and brutal way. The show didn\u2019t lie about its intention, being bland entertainment with a refreshing mechanic in its setting and was actually pretty funny at times with Subaru\u2019s stupidity influencing the character-dynamics. However, the entertainment I got from this show drastically decreased when they tried to implement dynamic politics and taking a much more psychological route than before. As I already stated, a show has to deliver in the three mentioned aspects for me to take it seriously and actually enjoy it. So, how did Re:Zero do in these aspects?\\n\\n\r\n> How\u2019s the world building? Does it feel real, dynamic and is it able to complement the overall atmosphere the show needs?\\n\\n\r\nLet me get this straight, the world building in this show is downright terrible. I might be a little biased having read Berserk beforehand with one of the best world building I\u2019ve seen to date, however it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Re:Zero\u2019s does so poorly on that aspect. Nothing feels in-depth or believable, as the show never really expands on, for example, the structures of domination of its countries, or goes deeper into its possibly interesting lore. What we see about the politics made me think it would\u2019ve been better if they just left it out entirely.\\n\r\nThe speeches and 'intentions' of the candidates contending for the position of dragon priestess could\u2019ve been copied entirely from the \u2018miss world\u2019 speeches back at last year. It seemed like they actually tried to implement every clich\u00e9 there is, making it absolutely impossible for me to take the politics seriously.\\n\r\nThe art style definitely didn\u2019t help to complement the atmosphere either. The character designs are basically cardboard cut-outs from the most generic fantasy card game you can find. Shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion were not ground-breaking at that aspect by any means, implementing rather basic character-designs in the show, yet they didn\u2019t actually influence the show\u2019s believability negatively like in Re:Zero. The overall world building of shows like NGE is miles ahead of it, showing plausible dystopian concepts and actual character-depth, worthy of being called a good deconstruction.\\n\\n\r\n> But how about the writing? Did it at least deliver in that aspect?\\n\\n\r\nWell, after some thinking about the show\u2019s premise of the resets, they actually do work after some kind of pattern and don\u2019t work at complete random, so I\u2019ll give the show some respect for that. However, what clearly does not work on set rules and works as a giant plot-device and inevitable plot-armor for Subaru is, when he actually tries to mention he can \u2018return by death\u2019. In most cases some kind of strange hand (most likely the hand of the main antagonist, the witch Satella) grabs Subaru\u2019s heart, causing him pain and increasing his \u2018witch\u2019s scent\u2019. However, at one moment he uses it to attract an enemy beast to him and guess what, in the next situation he uses it when he was in serious danger of dying and suddenly the same beasts attack the one who is actually trying to kill Subaru. To top it all off, at some point it actually kills off a close character so Subaru, without even explaining why. This mechanic is one big piece of trash, making it almost too easy for the author to maneuver the plot where he wants it to.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I have is, that the sole tension which is existent in this show\u2019s second half is the shock-factor, or as I would like to call it, the EDGE-factor. Normally I don\u2019t like using this buzzword, but for Re: Zero\u2019s story there is actually no better way to describe what is happening than that. Characters are being killed off in horrifying, borderline comedic ways all the time until roughly episode 19, where our main protagonists go through some kind of revelation. Suddenly the author openly refuses to kill off any character, making it ridiculously predictable that no major character is going to die, because no important reset is going to happen anymore until the end of the show, essentially giving all the characters plot-armor. When a narrative\u2019s tension is absolutely dependent on shock-factor and the shock-factor is eventually being negated, the tension just cannot be rebuilt anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThe third major problem of this series\u2019 writing is the mysteries. 'Major' mysteries about characters\u2019 backstories are solved in absolutely clich\u00e9 and uninteresting ways, giving it zero pay-off while watching. Seriously, Wilhelm's mystery was essentially him thinking his future wife was too kawaii to swing a sword in the frontlines, so he aimed to become better than her. But life sucks and she got killed by the White Whale, giving the author an excuse for making Wilhelm go OP enrage-mode against the monster, surfing on the damn thing like some wave-riders at the Pacific coast only dream they could. Also, the mystery of Rem/Ram got ruined by the overly present victimization and even that did not really justify all the stupid actions they made throughout the series.\\n\r\nOn contrary to that, the plotline until episode 19 was completely unpredictable. And no, unpredictable didn't mean good in most of the time. While the first few obstacles Subaru had to overcome were fine, the later plot-twists happen out of nowhere without proper foreshadowing, of what\u2019s happening, making it nearly impossible to keep track of the show\u2019s storyline and think about it, because you\u2019re literally bombarded with either unnecessary info-dumping or tone-shifting out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\n> Man this looks like a completely awful show until now. Are the characters at least a redeeming factor?\\n\\n\r\nNo, in fact, it might actually be the worst aspect of the show. I actually don\u2019t really feel like I can talk about the character as much as I did about the story because most of them are only memorable for one special quirk or are not memorable at all. Don\u2019t even think they go through some proper development during the series, which wouldn\u2019t have been that negative, if only they were likable and/or unique in the first place. An evolving character is not necessarily a good or bad thing, but if actually, almost no character develops appropriately in a series, you get the feeling, that the cast feels unnatural and boring.\\n\r\nThe only two characters which go through some notable development are Subaru and Rem and again, with notable I don\u2019t mean good. Rem\u2019s development is absolutely overdrawn and basically becomes a puppet to use for Subaru in the later part of the series, it seems like she lacks any sense of free will. Subaru\u2019s development was actually kind of good sometimes, the author made him a psychic mental-wreck because of all the overly brutal deaths he\u2019s been through at some point halfway through the series, but after a mere duration of one (!) episode all of his character-changes due to the suffering he\u2019s gone through gets negated, leaving me absolutely pissed about ruining the only decent development in the show so far.\\n\r\nProbably the biggest joke of the entire character cast has to be the main villain 'Betelguise' (actually feeling sorry for the enjoyable movie 'Beetlejuice' being the inspiration for this name). Liked crazy characters like Hisoka from Hunter x Hunter? Well, here we have a character which is actually 'craaaaaaazy' enough to rip off his hair, scream random adjectives, laugh uncontrollably and bite his fingernails WITHIN ONE FUCKING MINUTE. That's some good characterization, am I right?\\n\\n\r\n> Oh snap, does this show have any redeeming qualities whatsoever? \\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve already mentioned, I did actually enjoy the first few episodes for some funny moments and bland entertainment. The solid directing may have saved this show from being 1-2/10 material. Additionally, the Art and Animation is not bad at all, but the quality seems to fluctuate from episode to episode near the end, sometimes having problems to animate fight scenes properly (the Animation during the fight with the White Whale really sucked). But overall I can\u2019t complain too much about it.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was solid, the OPs and EDs are pretty catchy, but nothing really did impress me so much to look up some parts of the OSTs on the internet.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nThe show started off rather promising and truthfully about its intent, but developed into a complete trainwreck after some massive shifts of tone, straight up bad plot-twists, lackluster world building to create atmosphere and terribly unmemorable characters. If you want to watch a series, which actually has a lot of similar themes, watch the cash-cow of Studio White Fox\u2019s \u2018Steins;Gate\u2019, if you haven\u2019t already. I can\u2019t help but feel that Studio White Fox tried to reproduce the success of Steins;Gate, but failed miserably while trying to do so.\\n\\n\r\nStory (3/10)\\n\r\nArt (6.5/10), Animation (6.5/10)\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (2.5/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3.5/10)",

            "content": "The review contains some minor spoilers. I actually watched the whole show but only as a method of self-mortification. Whereas monks used to practice mortification of the flesh, I treated watching Re:Zero as mortification of my mind, patience and my sense of self-respect.\r\nI hate it when everyone is super hyped about a show and I can't for the life of me understand why. And this is exactly what happened with Re:Zero. Everyone was excited about it and called it the best anime or compared it to objectively superior shows. I watched 12 episodes of the show and got bored of it. I also had topause every time the MC said anything because I couldn\u2019t stop cringing. But people kept saying \"dude, watch episode 15, you'll love it!\". Well, I watched it. And I didn't love it. But why exactly is the show bad? Let me explain.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe MC, who is a NEET/shut-in (it's just an informed flaw, he never shows any signs of NEET-ness that can't be attributed to his severe mental retardedness, more about that later) and who gets transported to a fantasy world for some inexplicable reason. Hopefully this will be at least a minor plot point in the future because during the first season it is completely irrelevant. WHY does it always have to be a NEET teleported to a fantasy world? If you need a person unaware of local customs etc. you could think of a multitude of different ways to introduce them in the story without resorting to that awful clich\u00e9. And the worst part is that he instantly figured out this clich\u00e9 but the time-resetting one took him so long that for some time I thought that that time reset damaged his brain (later on I found out that actually he'd been brain damaged the whole time). Thankfully, he had that fucking bag of chips or he would still wander around the alleyways getting killed over and over 25 episodes later.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the first 3(4) episodes were not that terrible. Actually, they were the best part of the show. I\u2019d give that arc 6/10 even though I couldn\u2019t see shit half the time because it was so dark (maybe that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t dislike it that much?).\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is definitely worse than the first one. The MC becomes totally unrelatable and we get introduced to more boring, soulless, mindless characters that serve no other purpose than to orbit MC\u2019s dick. The plot becomes a complete joke with overused random \u201chumor\u201d and embarrassingly bad dialogue. Even though I\u2019m a very empathic person, I couldn\u2019t relate to the main character at all, the \u201ctear-jerker\u201d scene (in ep. 8? I think) just made me look at my watch every few minutes which is never a good sign when watching anything. I don\u2019t want to get too much into detail (and there isn\u2019t even that much to go into) but it is safe to say that you could either compress episodes 4-11 into two episodes or, even better, get rid of them completely and the show wouldn\u2019t lose anything important. My score for this arc is 2/10.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 12-14 is where the show went completely downhill. The amount of cringe was so huge that my body killed off half of my brain cells as a self-defense mechanism.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what about the famous episode 15? Well, it was ok. Better that the previous 10 or so episodes but still mediocre at best. By this time, I totally hated MC\u2019s guts and actually caught myself rooting for his opponents so I didn\u2019t feel anything when bad things kept happening to him.\\n\\n\r\nIf the series just went downhill in episodes 12-14, it crashed to the ground and and made a 10 foot hole during episodes 16-21. Despite that, the show did something actually praiseworthy. Making two action-focused episodes so horribly, mind-bogglingly BORING is a huge feat that deserves recognition. Bonus points for including flashbacks filled with weird emasculation fetish-fuel (what is up with that? The whole show is full of it). In fact, these episodes were so boring and dull that I had to watch the rest of the series at triple speed to somehow ease the pain connected with watching it. I may hate myself but not to such an extent as to watch this show normally. I actually tried to play it even faster but unfortunately I couldn't keep up with the subtitles.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I have to say that this last arc was more interesting than the 2 or 3 previous ones. Of course it doesn't say much since nothing more boring than those arcs even comes to my mind. I know that I watched the show for free and of my own free will but somehow I still considered filing a formal complaint about my wasted time. Watching the show was like watching a trainwreck but even less fun. The only thing that was interesting about the show was wondering how much worse the next episode was going to be and the show never disappointed and always brought a large dose of cringe, stupidity and boredom.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, the time-reset clich\u00e9 is not used very well and the show suffers from edgeitis. It also paradoxically depends on using shock value and resetting time instantly after, which makes most of it pointless. And please, don\u2019t tell me that this makes the MC slowly go insane or whatever. He\u2019s already retarded. He doesn\u2019t need to go insane as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is more, this series can't decide what type of show it wants to be. It tries to be a psychological show but it utterly fails at it because the characters are retarded and/or one-dimensional. It includes a lot of action but its action scenes are so boring that most harem anime have better action sequences. It tries to be a drama but the only sad and heartbreaking part of the show is the number of people enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nTaking everything into consideration, the story definitely showed promise but it was presented so poorly that it is impossible for it to salvage the show. It\u2019s all because of the aspect of the show that definitely is the weakest, namely\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nOh boy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever watched a show with worse characters. The ones that aren\u2019t stupid or boring are stupid, boring and annoying at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC is probably the worst MC I\u2019ve ever seen. It is definitely nice that the author tried to give mentally retarded people some representation in the show but perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have included one as a main character. The MC is completely unrelatable and during the course of the 15 episodes he becomes completely unlikable as well. Again, it is fine to have characters that people are going to despise in the show but please, don\u2019t make them the MC!\\n\r\nThe MC is incredibly dumb, can\u2019t do anything right, is a creepy stalker that acts like an obsessive ex-boyfriend and is the cringiest character that I\u2019ve ever seen. Every time he opens his retarded mouth he spews things that instantly increase your autism spectrum. Seriously, I didn\u2019t cringe that much even when watching WataMote and that show was based on second-hand embarrassment humor.\\n\r\nWhat is more, the MC doesn\u2019t learn anything, like, for example, the fact that he can kill himself to fix the past. He did it once and he fixed everything thanks to that but he never tries it again. However, during the course of the series, me saying \"kill yourself\" to the main character gradually stopped meaning \"go back in time and fix everything\" and changed the meaning to \"just end the suffering - both yours and mine\". Apart from mental retardation, the MC also suffers from a bipolar syndrome. Every time he dies he switches from being a pathetic waste of oxygen wallowing in self-pity to being a super-aggressive and even more supper-annoying avatar of cringe and stupidity, and vice versa. He gets less dumb towards the end of the series but his cringe-factor is still through the roof and you still can't take such an embarrasing person seriously.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the fact that he can\u2019t tell anyone about his time-resetting predicament is a very cheap plot device. If I recall correctly, it had a practical use once or twice but that still doesn\u2019t justify that.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, the MC is retarded, unlikable and unrelatable and his motives are stupid (he went through so much shit just to save maidos whom he had known for a whopping 5 days or so and who showed almost nothing but disdain for him and one of them actually tried to kill him).\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve always thought that there is nothing worse than a bland, beta character without any personality traits but they at least usually have an interesting supporting cast unlike the MC in this show.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d discuss other mouth-breathing, soulless and completely bland and cookie-cutter characters but it is actually not worth it (just like this show). There wasn't a single character that I liked when the show ended. I liked the crazy dude for an episode or two but I got bored of him pretty quickly. And I felt pity for the blue haired maid because she was trapped in this show and fell for such an idiotic character. It doesn't mean that I liked her though. Besides being a cheap waifu-bait, she is completely uninteresting and unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously though, I don\u2019t remember any show that had characters so terrible. Even other edgy shows like Akame ga Kill had a few characters that I almost liked.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\r\nThe art is ok. A solid 7/10. There is no fanservice which is nice. Character designs are shit though.\\n\r\nThere is nothing particularly good about the audio aspect of the show but there is nothing bad either. Unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s see: the premise was ok but the actual story is bad (to put it mildly), characters are atrocious and drag the whole show down, the rest is unremarkable. However, I actually have an idea how to salvage this show in the second season (if there is one). Let the MC reset time back to the first episode, kill him for good and start again from there.\\n\\n\r\nYou probably noticed that I used the words \"retarded\" and \"unremarkable\" a lot. That's, of course, because most of the show is retarded and the rest is unremarkable. The fact that most discussions about the show are waifu wars also confirm it. When someone says that the show is great just keep in mind that what they probably mean is \"I liked one of the maids/the loli/that half-elf\". Even if the best part of the show is waifus, then it completely fails since they're so bland and uninteresting. Seriously, no matter what you're looking for in a show, other shows do it better. If you want to see a good time-travel-related anime then watch Steins;Gate. If you want to watch a good transported-to-a-fantasy-world anime\u2026 Well, tough luck. But other anime are still probably better than this one. However, if you are tired of actually good anime and have too much time to spare and/or you are a masochist... then I still can't recommend this show. It would be too cruel. Recommending this show should actually be considered a criminal offense. \\n\\n\r\nRight now, the show is rated 8.77 on MAL which is a complete disgrace. Originally, I rated this show 4. I did so because it was horrible but I still watched it. Unfortunately, it commited the worst sin any show can commit - it became really boring. I mean, it had horribly boring episodes before but episodes 18-21 were so dull that it actually made me think that I'd rather go outside than watch this show and that had never happened to me before when watching anything else. That's why I deducted one point. And, once again, I\u2019m surprised by the fact that so many people genuinely enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\nI know that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but it\u2019s still a stupid opinion.",

            "content": "[3.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n[Re:Zero \u2013 Our Very Own Buzzword]\r\nWhat is deconstruction? What is subversion? What is the reason these terms exist within the realm of entertainment media? Why do they matter? Our need to attach holistically positive or negative terms to reinforce our own positive or negative ideals is a staple of criticism. It's a staple of judging media, period. These buzzwords have filled everyone\u2019s vocabularies over the course of the last few years. Whether it's due to online critics or simply the consumption of analysis-based content without the interest and engagement necessary to understand these more nuanced topics. It's unfortunate that I even must call something likesubversion or deconstruction a \"nuance\" at this point, since it most definitely isn't. However, with its use being flanderized beyond belief, I find it hard to call it anything but a nuanced definition filled with separate sub-contexts and colloquialisms.\u00a0Which is disappointing because all these new meanings pull away from what these words were meant to describe within the realm of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero isn\u2019t what you may think it to be. I say this because after over a week of watching this show, I gaze over my ten pages of notes and I see things that I feel I wouldn\u2019t care about if these newly defined adjectives weren\u2019t tacked onto this show. Re:Zero feels like a victim of its expectations and what people drew it as, which is why I feel the need to describe exactly what I view is wrong with this series in excruciating detail. Detail that I feel will need to cut because I want this review to be at least somewhat palatable to the daily reader and not some thirty-five-thousand-word analysis that it may come out to be. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers are to be expected here. If you are a someone who has yet to see the show and values complete plot cluelessness walking into it then I advise you not read any further. I feel the need to go step by step, arc by arc, and examine and identify the root of a show like this\u2019 problem. It lays within marketing, within pandering, within safety, within the very industry which spawned its being. For once, I feel like I have a lot to say. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Re:Start \u2013 Beginning a Journey]\\n\\n\r\n\tThe opening is boring enough. Our tracksuit wearing protagonist, Subaru, walks out of a convenience store, closes his eyes, and opens them in another world. The context to these events can be read into as the entire story of the show begins to slowly become clear, however, the \u201cjourney into the new world\u201d aspect of this show didn\u2019t have an inspired start. Regardless, it\u2019s about what you\u2019d expect from a \u201ctrapped in another world that just so happens to be the most generic possible fantasy setting that we\u2019ve seen in hundreds of shitty Asian MMORPG\u2019s\u201d, especially since our protagonist is self-aware. Which doesn\u2019t amount to anything, he points out things he recognizes from games and moves on. \u201cThis is like a video game\u201d, isn\u2019t really substantial or investing commentary in the situation. I get it\u2019s supposed to be comedy, but it doesn\u2019t sell the scene with these comparisons especially since he just got transported an alien world. You have no idea what will happen with your what just happened, yet; hey, at least it looks like a video game, right? \\n\\n\r\nHe eventually encounters some thugs and meets his love interest. The wonderfully designed Emilia, who serves as the crux of this shows narrative in an expected way. From her very introduction, and my awareness that there most definitely won\u2019t just be one girl in a show like this, I foresaw the obvious truth that she will be what drives the protagonist. Now it\u2019s up to the show to \u201csubvert\u201d those expectations, which is a buzzword you better get ready to start hearing. Throughout the initial two-episode pilot, we encounter exactly what this show will revolve around. Subaru\u2019s \u201cReturn by Death\u201d ability, which was named by him because \u201chey, it\u2019s like a video game anime thing!\u201d This ability allows him to return to a previously visited situation and, for all intents and purposes, reset time. Okay, so it\u2019s a Groundhog Day stuck-in-a-fantasy-world series with video game roots. You can see why I harbored doubt after the first two episodes, right? Unless it works hard to craft a separate identity that\u2019s able to sustain a strong narrative then it\u2019s bound to fail as a combination of two genres that are both really popular in the industry right now.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d go so far as to say that the entire idea is a perfect marketing strategy. If two generic archetypes for light novel shows are popular, why not mesh them? It\u2019d be even better if the mesh comes from yet another light novel so you have previously established fans to add to the stock number you\u2019ll get by just having appealing character designs and a quazi-harem. While the biggest surprise is its R-rated violence, which is still held back by the entire Japanese industry, unfortunately. On a slightly off-topic note, it\u2019s so strange to see an industry that revels in the sexualization, even of incredibly young characters, yet recoils at the idea of having blood that doesn\u2019t have a fake sheen and hilariously sloppy sound-effects. You may say these kinds of unbelievable sounds are a remnant of the past, however, I\u2019ll offer my rebuttal in the words; \u201cEvolve or go extinct.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes may be generic; they aren\u2019t overly bad. I remember first checking out the pilot with a few friends many months ago when it first aired. While I had no interest in picking it back up, I will say that they weren\u2019t nearly as awful as any of us were expecting. This world, or its characters, aren\u2019t interesting, but the premise and nature of the show isn\u2019t an inherent turnoff either. \\n\\n\r\nWe begin meeting a plethora of characters in the first mini-arc of the show that really go nowhere within the first season. Felt, a bandit-loli that is pretty much the shows tomboy. Reinhard which isn\u2019t a heavy armor-clad German knight from the future, but instead is a generic spiky-haired knight wearing cool futuristic-yet-medieval robes that exposits some dialogue about magic or something.  They play virtually no role within the show\u2019s first season apart from being reintroduced later, so ignoring them we proceed with the protagonist, Subaru, dying multiple times to what feels like poorly thought out situations. \\n\\n\r\nThe first villain, which doesn\u2019t get killed, also doesn\u2019t return. I feel like this show is working extra hard to try and get as many elements moving without being sure of a second season. No hate against that, though. We proceed to the moment this show truly beings to show its colors. The introduction to the MC\u2019s home for the next ten-ish episodes. A mansion that Emilia lives in with her cute spirit-cat, owned by Roswaal L. Mathers. There is another loli, Beatrice, who serves to give exposition and hilarious plot holes, then get promptly forgotten. As well as a group of maids. Rem and Ram. Now I say Rem, then Ram, because that\u2019s pretty much how the show wants us to think.\\n\\n\r\nThese two incredibly well-designed and inherently attractive characters are twins that are, in my opinion, the finest example of waifu-bait I\u2019ve seen in anime\u2026 so far. Especially Rem, since Ram, similar to most secondary\u2019s, gets forgotten about quickly. Rem is an interesting beast, and as the story progresses I\u2019ll get the opportunity to dive further into why I believe she\u2019s so popular. \\n\\n\r\n\tNow don\u2019t get it twisted, I was very aware that these characters existed. The reason I watched the entirety of this show was because the ludicrous amount of hype that was being drawn to it. I want to say this directly, though, I\u2019m not one to get fully invested into the hype. I was aware about the kind of show this was and I didn\u2019t expect it to be anything great even if the community was collectively circle jerking about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe show then takes on a slice-of-life-esq narrative which involves Subaru getting to know everyone and then getting brutally murdered by a mysterious figure. These episodes are, by all means, light hearted. The scenes shift between teased romance and comedy often and the only true stingers we get are in the obligatory cliffhangers that exist solely to create interest in the upcoming episodes. I\u2019m not one to care about cliffhangers unless they are used sparingly to create a drastic tonal shift. However, they quickly became extremely common-place within Re:Zero that they harbored no dramatic tension to them. You happen to glance over at the episodes run time and notice it\u2019s about to end, \u201chere comes the stinger,\u201d you think to yourself. \\n\\n\r\nTowards the intended climax of this arc, as the baddie is revealed and I slowly start to get a better picture of this show, it began to infuriate me. Not since No Game No Life has a show gotten so deep under my skin as a product with the intended purpose of entertainment. It felt cloying in the worst possible way. The reveal that Rem was the assailant and that she was also a cute girl made me instantly understand that this show only has the intension of subverting expectations when it means not sacrificing its market value as something made to get money. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Of Dogs, Rem, and Broken Things]\\n\\n\r\n\tThis show isn\u2019t bland, forgettable, or insipid. It\u2019s infuriating, pandering, and redundant. Now I know what you may be thinking, \u201cwell, don\u2019t those things go together?\u201d No. Not really. There\u2019s a distinct difference between praising something and simply having something be popular. I don\u2019t get angry at Transformers for being an incredibly high-grossing film for the same reason I don\u2019t get angry at Taylor Swift for selling millions of records every year. They\u2019re there to fill that abundant market and they do it well. If I watch, or listen to them, I will review them accordingly. I gave Sword Art Online a two, and I gave its second season a one. I did this because I truly believe that show has nothing to offer to me as a viewer, however, I acknowledge its role in the entire industry. It\u2019s the bran flakes, the transformers, the Swift, the Drake of anime. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero isn\u2019t that. Or so you are lead to believe. Re:Zero tries to have its cake and eat it too. It wants to be respectably different from the archetype it encapsulates, but it also wants to maintain the ability to sell to the people that love the archetype it encapsulates. I won\u2019t be the first to say that this kind of entertainment inherently doesn\u2019t work. The people who love SAO wouldn\u2019t love something that completely contradicts why they love SAO, and to create a compelling, awe-inspiring narrative, you genuinely must do something completely contrary to what SAO did. I\u2019m not saying this because SAO is a show that people love ragging on, because I can see why people would think that, I\u2019m saying this because as a student of entertainment I feel it\u2019s my job to discover what works, and what doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s also my job to understand why it works and doesn\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero doesn\u2019t have this luxury so you are left with a show that is in an infinite tug-o\u2019-war between itself. Two parts of a whole that can never be complete. This inherent want to reach for the stars but to stay grounded in preconceived tropes and ideals is what keeps this show thoroughly frustrating to watch, and what keeps me from ever getting invested in anything that happens. \\n\\n\r\nAn easy example is the concept of subversion in context with this show. I see that word, as well as \u201cdeconstruction\u201d being thrown around by people. Not only is there a complete misunderstanding of their intended concepts, but the entire idea is missed here. This is because subversion is used to comment on the archetypes being subverted in a clever way. It\u2019s almost a backhanded and creative way to show, rather than describe. It is a play on expectations, but it isn\u2019t a twist. A twist is something you don\u2019t see coming, a subversion is the ability to twist what you may think describes something. What it isn\u2019t is meta. A subversion doesn\u2019t have to be meta. Re:Zero misses this mark with astounding accuracy. \\n\\n\r\nSubaru is a self-aware character, and that\u2019s fine. But the only explained subversion I see here is his ability to point out a clich\u00e9. Which is, naturally, a fine thing to do from a character like this. Yet they don\u2019t comment on this clich\u00e9, they don\u2019t do anything with it, he simply comments on it and continues through with it. Once again, the show attempting to have its cake and eat it too. It doesn\u2019t work and, as I\u2019ve said, is frustrating as hell to sit through. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero\u2019s meta nature is something that detracts from its verisimilitude, but the show needs to have believability if it wants to be taken seriously; which it does. The amount of cloying emotional melodrama that occurs within this shows second arc is intoxicating, as I constantly found myself with flashbacks of Your Lie in April, as every character\u2019s teary-eyed confessions and pained yells try to claw at your heartstrings. I said this during my review of that show and I\u2019ll say it again here, if you want me to care and feel bad about something, give me something to feel bad about. I want to know these characters before you tell me why I should be crying. I don\u2019t care that something sad is happening. \\n\\n\r\nThis is further exacerbated with Rem and Subaru\u2019s growing relationship and how the situations they find themselves in are absolutely ridiculous. This witches curse that Subaru is inflicted with conveniently prevents him from telling anyone what he is going through, yet he obviously begins to get attached to these characters. However, to my hilarious surprise, they begin to reciprocate these feelings towards him without any reason to. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point in the show it was very obvious that the writer was going for the villain-empathy into wanting companion trope with Rem. She\u2019s \u201cevil\u201d for a little bit but I don\u2019t think anyone with an eye for television believed that she wouldn\u2019t turn good. I haven\u2019t seen much anime at all and I can easily tell that when a character is cute, they must be inducted in the harem. Especially if this show is in a fantasy setting with a spiky-haired protagonist who only has one pair of clothes. Rem was clearly going to start wanting to floss her teeth with Subaru\u2019s pubes, the question was\u2026 how? \\n\\n\r\nThe \u201cattack of the dogs\u201d mini-story serves to finish a wider arc as well as to give reason for Rem to be inducted into the Subaru show. Yet it\u2019s done in such a backhanded and hilarious illogical way that I had to literally pause and sit back in true-to-god shock at what I\u2019m watching right now. To explain further, let me spell out the first, and incredibly hilarious plot-hole that\u2019s so bafflingly in your face that I\u2019m surprised people didn\u2019t just outright drop the show. \\n\\n\r\nEarlier on in the Re:Zero\u2019s second arc, Beatrice, or as Subaru calls her, Drill-loli, as she has funky looking hair-drills, explains to him that curses are inherently incurable. You cannot cure a curse with simple magic. The way a curse is placed on you is through touch, so the biggest way to avoid getting it placed on you is to avoid touching. Which is kind of dumb to begin with, since by those means this world may be the most unsafe and awful place to live in. But regardless, those are the rules. Fine. I can accept that.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, literally two episodes later, while Subaru is investigating how he got cursed, he finds the culprit and takes the information to Beatrice. She shows him the location of the curse and then\u2026 I kid you not, cures it with simple magic. There was this special moment where I was waiting for the show to acknowledge what just happened. I waited and waited and then the credits rolled. Then I realized I was watching something that\u2019s bad. Then it all made sense to me. \\n\\n\r\n\tWith this shows lack for attention explained and showcased, the \u201cattack of the dogs\u201d arc should\u2019ve been more expected to me. At this point I was watching this show because I was curious to see what anyone liked it in. Subaru, and trust me, I\u2019ll get to his character later, throws himself into a hilarious dangerous position where he is positive to get brutalized again, however, to his surprise, Rem the cute-totally-not-pandering character bursts out of the woods and saves him. She promptly makes work of the mabeasts and shows him that she\u2019s one hell of a badass (but she\u2019s totally cute and dressed like a maid so not threatening in terms of characterization). Then more dogs show up. Yet for some reason she says that now it has become too dangerous and it seems like this is a situation they may not survive. Even though she just obliterated fourteen demon puppers in a few seconds. She tells Subaru to run away and he kind of does, as she follows him whilst chopping, smashing, and bashing her way through the plenty of demon dogs being thrown at her.\\n\\n\r\nThe next we see of her she\u2019s been wounded, somehow. Then a rockslide occurs. This rockslide has direct contact with Rem, yet for some reason it ends up knocking her into the sky. Which baffled me. Aren\u2019t avalanches supposed to suck you under? So, she gets knocked into the sky and falls onto the ground bloodied and beaten. However, her true edginess has just begun, as it\u2019s revealed that she is actually a one-horned demon. Cool! She begins to go super saiyan and just destroy all these dogs that stand between her and survival. Subaru, being the retard he is, notices a dog behind her and instead of gauging the situation as it is, this bitch is going HAM, he decides to push her out of the way and sacrifice himself. Which makes zero sense in context or without context. She was going ballistic and just destroying them. He begins to get chomped up as a distant call of his name is heard from her. \\n\\n\r\nThis is further unexplained as to why she called his name because as we see later in the next arc that she has no concept of what she\u2019s doing whilst in the demon form. So, her calling his name would be like the hulk reading a dictionary whilst hulking out. Makes no sense. Regardless, this kind of ridiculous and flawed kindergarten writing is prevalent throughout the entirety of this shows first half. This doesn\u2019t just make me lose faith in what makes animation great, this makes me lose faith in what makes entertainment great. The fact that countless people praise this show to the extent they do while looking over obviously failed, major narrative problems makes me believe that the only reason people like this show is because for once the eventual love-interest is also someone who kicks ass on occasion. That\u2019s not anything new, why do people care about this? Oh, yeah, she\u2019s cute. There is one thing giving the viewer what they want. There\u2019s another thing with force feeding them forced romantic bullshit with no character, chemistry, or creativity until they are bloated, greasy balls of bullshit rolling around praising a show for elements that aren\u2019t there. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point in the series I would\u2019ve dropped it two times over. I honestly couldn\u2019t stand it. At the time, it was the epitome of everything I despise in anime and why this medium isn\u2019t taken seriously. It is pandering bullshit disguised as subversion when in reality it\u2019s a show made to make you feel the basest of emotions while wrapped in a semi-original premise. There are non-characters flopping around on-screen until one them gets murdered in some boring, edgy, dark, and uncreative way. I don\u2019t care these characters are getting killed because they have the personality and engagement-potential of a wet mop. \\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s third arc, which expands on Rem and Ram\u2019s backstory, which to the shows credit isn\u2019t fucked up with crappy plot holes and semi-cleverly explains Ram\u2019s reliance on Rem as a parallel to Rem\u2019s earlier reliance on Ram. The show even goes so far as to hint at a sadomasochistic side of Rem, as her younger self is shown smiling at her sister\u2019s fate. However, much like a lot of this shows earlier elements, it is never mentioned again. The backstory itself isn\u2019t overly creative, however, the way it is told is engaging. Unfortunately, the obvious conclusion from this backstory still needs to be explained by Rem in the most contrived and \u201cdo you get it yet?\u201d monologue. \\n\r\nRe:Zero also has a tendency to pull character abilities out of thin air. Ram gets some crazy psychic abilities that weren\u2019t ever actually talked about before she had to use them, which, while acceptable, still is an incredibly unoriginal way to introduce and use character abilities. The fight scenes within these arcs are also resolved through convenience and not actual development. This shows over-reliance on a character\u2019s appearance to make you care about them is a perfect example as to why a lot of anime struggles with character relations in my eyes. I don\u2019t care if you are gorgeous or ugly, you need to be interesting if you want me to be engaged in your story. This is a cheap tactic to create empathy where otherwise there wouldn\u2019t be any. \\n\r\nThe third arc wraps up with Rem having a breakdown over her previous childhood reliance on Ram, while Ram has a reliance on her now. She does the thing every anime character in these shounen shows does and blames herself for things that were very clearly out of her control in every way. Cause why not. Since Subaru is a white knight (more on that later), we get a scene where he talks about how amazing she is, yet the things he brings up are kind of hilariously mundane. He talks about how she\u2019s a good cook. He tells a maid\u2026 how she\u2019s good at cooking. Listen, she\u2019s having an emotional breakdown here and if your main talking point is how good a woman is at cooking then I think you\u2019re talking skills are exactly where your ideologies are; in the past. I\u2019m not some ranting feminist or anything, but this was a hysterical scene for all the wrong reasons. \\n\\n\r\nIt also became very clear that Subaru doesn\u2019t have a vested interest in Rem. He has always liked Emilia and will most definitely end up with her by the end of this season. Yet this show really tries to make you believe that he won\u2019t, even if it is obvious he will. This is further disappointing since Emilia, up to this point, lacked any kind of character. At all. While Rem was a mish-mash of the most appealing possible waifu traits, Emilia was a cute mom. Hey, she\u2019s unaware about flirting and is soft-spoken. That\u2019s her personality. Yet Subaru is head-over-heels for her for reasons that can only be described as \u201cplot-oriented\u201d, since the only thing she must offer is her well-done design. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[A Tale of the Whitest Knight]\\n\\n\r\n\tSubaru sucks. He is an infuriatingly incompetent main character. Not because he has character. It\u2019s because he\u2019s genuinely inexplicable as a character. He starts off as a snarky self-aware protagonist that isn\u2019t original, but serviceable. Then he becomes flirtatious. Then he becomes edgy. Then he reverts to where he was but with more self-awareness. However, what truly drives me nuts is how much of a white knight he is. If you are unaware of this term, Urban Dictionary will aid me with the definition; \u201cA person (usually a male) who sees the typical maiden in distress, and believe that he can help her.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nSubaru is this. Except he\u2019s like what you\u2019d imagine a socially incapable neckbeard to be like around girls, but the girls are just cutout waifu characters. Yet Subaru acts incredibly confident, yet still defensive of these characters which can\u2019t be described as anything but his own possessions. I could honestly see him forbidding one of them from going outside just because he fears for them. The only reason for his infatuation with them is because they are cute, and man if cute girls don\u2019t make the anime world go around. \\n\\n\r\nSo he feels indebted to Emilia for her ability to save him, yet he feels indebted to the point where he falls in love with her simply because she saved him. It\u2019s such a shallow reason to love someone that I honestly didn\u2019t expect the show not to acknowledge it. Yet it doesn\u2019t. Subaru gets himself into so many obnoxious situations simply due to his ability not to let his possessions get hurt. It is maddening to see this kind of story repeat over the course of this shows first half. Actually, fuck Subaru. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Politics in Anime]\\n\\n\r\nPolitics suck in anime. I haven\u2019t seen a single anime do politics well. I don\u2019t want you to take this as a holistic statement. I haven\u2019t seen much anime, but much like anyone\u2019s notions about television or anything, really, they are based on experience. In my experience, politics in anime are insanely unappealing. They are always so black-and-white that they lack any actual tension or reason to be invested in the situation. What makes politics interesting is how much moral grey there is to the arguments being made. However, that is never actually portrayed. So when Re:Zero delves into some politics in the middle half I was at my peak groan-level. It was hitting every preconceived trapping and archetype so well that I was expecting some kind of twist showing that all of this was an elaborate plan and it was all just some kind of simulation. \\n\\n\r\nBut no. We are introduced to these wacky and zany archetypes of political figures during a big meeting where the new ruler of their land is decided. These elderly councilmen all line up to determine the leader, which all happen to be cute-ass girls! Then the bickering begins. For an entire episode, we get non-stop bickering from everyone. Every ruler states their desires and motivations in such a amusingly forced way that It was a surprise the show didn\u2019t point out that clich\u00e9. They just step up on their little soap box and give us a line or two about what they want to do. Let me break it down for you. \\n\\n\r\nPotential Leader 1 -->  I want equality for all!\\n\\n\r\nPotential Leader 2 -->  I hate everyone and I just want to rule over all you scum\\n\\n\r\nPotential Leader 3 -->  I\u2019m greedy and just want stuff\\n\\n\r\nPotential leader 4  --> The government sucks and I want reform\\n\\n\r\nSo two of those four are completely drawn to be characters not there to truly create any kind of political and moral intrigue. They are just the \u201cbad guys\u201d. The fourth leader is there to play a part in a future episode, which she does. The first leader is Emilia and is obviously the one audiences should want to win. \\n\\n\r\nHow is this compelling again? Why should I care about this? What\u2019s the point of this arc? Oh, yeah, to have Subaru become the whitest knight of them all. There is clich\u00e9d bickering in front of the council of elders that are just kind of sitting there watching their leaders bicker over what might as well be spilled milk, which is lacking any self-awareness. Subaru hears his waifu get offended over her race, which is half-elf, and gets triggered and begins to try and yell at people. He then declares himself, get this, her knight. And the knights in this show all wear white. I couldn\u2019t even make this up if I tried. Then he promptly gets beaten up by another knight and then explodes on Emilia for not repaying him in any way. Yet all he\u2019s done is act like a white knight and get himself killed many times. It\u2019s dumb, yet it creates a rift between the two that lasts the entire second half of the show. He likes her cause she\u2019s cute and nice. Then tries to be her knight. That\u2019s this arc. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I went to the fan-reaction of this episode so many people were praising the characterization Emilia got that it prompted me to want to re-watch this episode. Where was she being characterized? All it did was give her the ability to get upset. Fucking good. She should\u2019ve been annoyed by how clingy and annoying Subaru is by the fifth episode. These fans are praising a character for literally just showing an emotion that isn\u2019t her base kit of cute blushes and smiles. Is this how fucking backwards and asinine liking a show like this has become? \u201cWell this character isn\u2019t just waifu-bait cardboard-cutout-chan, what great writing!\u201d This wreck is doing the bare minimum here. \\n\\n\r\nA few things happen here and there and he finds that everyone died. I don\u2019t care because over the course of fourteen episodes they didn\u2019t develop anyone but Rem, and her development went from deadpan cute maid with a bad ass side to cute maid that loves our protagonist because he saved her by getting almost killed for no reason with a bad ass side. All these characters were slaughtered yet we already know exactly what will happen. Something will lead to his death and then he\u2019ll have another chance at it all. This is a fault in the very concept of the show. It\u2019s showing us all this shocking shit yet none of it is retain-able because none of it is lasting. The only way to make it last is through Subaru\u2019s emotional state. Yet that gets reverted quick, as I will explain shortly. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Episode 15] \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I knew about this show other than that \u201cRem is best girl!\u201d was that episode fifteen was a doozy. I was expecting some twists, I was expecting some turns, I was expecting something neat. Obviously, my expectations slowly waned as I watched the fourteen episodes leading up to it. All I was expecting at this point was that it won\u2019t leave me wanting to gouge my eyes out. Here\u2019s hoping for some hype!\\n\\n\r\nYou know what? It delivered on hype. It was the best episode of the show, bar none. While this isn\u2019t necessarily a great accomplishment, it is something nice nevertheless. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think it was the best episode for the reason the show was intending it to be. It introduced a new villain and oh boy is he hilarious. Episode fifteen made me genuinely laugh harder than I had in a week. This new villain is like those generic anime villains where they\u2019re eyes bulge out of their faces and they are all zany and wacky and edgy. Also, in true Re:Zero fashion, he\u2019s hopelessly self-aware about certain clich\u00e9s yet the show still does them so those self-aware remarks serve no purpose other than to rub in the fact that they are doing these clich\u00e9s with no actual subversion. But he\u2019s also like discount joker; and it\u2019s fucking sidesplitting. What makes it even funnier is that the characters are genuinely frighted on him. I had tears in my eyes for all the wrong reasons as our beloved character, blue waifu, had all her bones broken and her limbs twisted. It was glorious. I was so happy to see this show showing something gruesome for once. \\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t lie, I\u2019m a huge fan of gore. I think the ability to show something gory, whether it\u2019s for shock value or not, is inherently interesting in some way or another. The idea of gore is, in concept, very interesting. I\u2019ll avoid discussing why as it\u2019ll make this insanely long review even longer, however, I will say that I think it has the potential to add a lot to something. This show was bloody, but it wasn\u2019t gory. It was always just streaks of blood or just wonky gushes and sprays here and there. It never felt brutal and it sure as hell never felt emotionally powerful or draining to witness. Rem getting destroyed wasn\u2019t overly disgusting or anything, but at least there was a small effort made here to be a little disturbing. I would\u2019ve loved if they took it farther. Like, much farther. To sell a psychopath you need to not be restrained by the industry. \\n\\n\r\nI was shown how gory the show could\u2019ve been in some illustrations that I believe were based on the Light Novel (if not directly from it) and I was thoroughly saddened by the fact that this was airing in an industry where even a little gore would be censored immediately. I feel like if it embraced its B-movie roots it would\u2019ve been an astoundingly fun show to watch. Unfortunately, not, though, and as the hilarity ends and the regular cloying-ass clich\u00e9 dialogue starts again we revert to what the show sucks at. Just about everything else. The episode, though, to its benefit had a great cliffhanger for once. \\n\\n\r\nThis truly awe-inspiring cliffhanger was unfortunately undermined by an after-credits scene that sucked all the epic-ness out of everything.  The fifteenth episode finally had the show revel in fuckery and was quite enjoyable because of it. It\u2019s a shame that it was the only one of its kind, since this show refuses to be campy even if it is. These characters are meant to be killed, and while I know a lot of people would be upset with since I\u2019m sure everyone loves blue-hair waifu and everyone loves white-hair waifu and probably didn\u2019t like red-haired waifu as much, but I, personally, would\u2019ve loved to see a classic grind house in anime form. It\u2019d be a pleasure to watch with friends. \\n\\n\r\nAn increase in gore would\u2019ve also had a better effect on the story. Since the only way to raise these psychological stakes is to have us experience what Subaru is. You do this by showing us the gruesome results in a way that does have us recoil in nastiness. The way Re:Zero does this is just weak. It felt like Subaru didn\u2019t \u201cwant to die\u201d, however, he had to, but it doesn\u2019t feel like remotely enough progression. It didn\u2019t feel like he grew too much from each death. It didn\u2019t feel like he got properly damaged, and when the show showed that he may have, it never actually solidified this kind of narrative progression. He just shifted from fiery MC to depressed boy and then was knocked out of that depression by some motivational speech. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Confession]\\n\\n\r\nRem spills her wish-fulfillment on Subaru and it\u2019s probably the most I\u2019ve ever cringed at an anime before. No hate towards anyone who enjoyed this sequence, but I just felt so uncomfortable. It felt like the most pandering possible thing to do. It\u2019s wish-fulfillment. Really just a cute girl talking about this is made for guys to fawn over and that\u2019s about it. \\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, Subaru is self-aware about these flaws he has. Towards the latter half of this show there is an incredibly long emotional scene between Subaru and Rem. He dishes out just about everything he has taken, about the pain, the anger, the amount he\u2019s been broken by these experiences. Whilst for me I didn\u2019t buy his trials and tribulations since they lacked any kind of emotional resonance, I did feel like the VA did the best job he could\u2019ve done conveying these feelings, though. Inopportunely, these feelings are based on a sub-par narrative. When a character admits his flaws, that\u2019s the first step to overcoming them, right? \\n\\n\r\nWell, not for Re:Zero it\u2019s not. He gets literally all of these flaws validated. Every single one. It\u2019s supposed to be a parallel to how he helped Rem\u2019s emotional breakdown, however, it doesn\u2019t remotely feel like the same thing. Rem is straight up excusing everything he\u2019s done just because she has fallen in love with him for an equally shallow reason that he\u2019s fallen in love with Emilia. This kind of situation didn\u2019t make much sense to me. They make these clear parallel\u2019s yet do nothing with them, but more importantly, these parallels serve as a way to excuse actions that an MC who was made to be self-inserted into did. It\u2019s the queen of all fan-service and pandering. Rem, the most waifu-bait character just validated everything that would be criticized of socially-incapable nerds. They give this corny quazi-relationship throughout a lot of this shows middle-half where Rem clearly has a big crush on him, and I suppose that gives her enough of a reason to fawn over him so much that she literally goes into cringe-inducing details about a fantasy relationship. It genuinely made me uncomfortable, which is funny since the actual scenes meant to make me uncomfortable couldn\u2019t even do that. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s a soap opera. Subaru is an awful person who does nothing yet takes the blame for everything and that\u2019s portrayed as okay in this show. He does grow, but in ways that benefit the character. It frustrated me to no end. Regardless if he buys it or not, it happened. \\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the saddest thing though. He rejects her. As I guessed from the first few episodes, Subaru\u2019s heart lies with the cardboard cutout waifu and not the body-pillow waifu. Since he\u2019s an anime protagonist and every girl is bound to warm up to him eventually, even Beatrice in this odd shoehorned scene of her expressing sadness over his inevitable death. So this rejection was then supplemented by Rem just kind of shrugging it off and then both of them laugh it off. \\n\\n\r\nI was just annoyed about this move. They had to address this relationship and made it seem like this crazy narrative maneuver but instead just made it an excuse for Rem to continue to fawn over Subaru with a potential tease of their possible relationship. It is frankly sickening how much Re:Zero wants to stick to a perceived status quo while still pretending to subvert clich\u00e9s. This scene is there to maintain their relationship and the cutesy factor without actually addressing the core of the \u201cMC can get em\u2019 all\u201d trope. It\u2019s a cheap tactic that simply tries to, as I\u2019ve said many times, have the cake and eat it too. It doesn\u2019t work. Either be a sleazy harem or be a show with one relationship. This kind of unbelievable mushiness is there to serve as pandering fan service and is a detriment to original television. \\n\\n\r\nFrom here on every conversation Subaru has with Rem is just dripping with this kind of pandering bullshit that makes my eyes roll back. All they do is complement each other and pledge loyalty to one another and say how awesome they are over and over again. It\u2019s a competition of who can be a massive suck up and it\u2019s painful to listen to. It genuinely ruins my mood to see this gushy bullshit amidst a supposedly intense battle. They are trying too hard to keep this ship alive, and to my unwarranted surprise, people actually buy it. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[A Whale of a Climax]\\n\\n\r\nThe White Whale arc is cool. This is where I think the show finally could get to something that, while far from intense and original, was serviceable as entertainment. It ditched a lot of cloying nonsense and went for a direct threat-to-solve scenario. A massive White Whale was in the area and, of course, one of the previously established characters has a sad history of it. The first few episodes were slow and somewhat tedious, but the actual confrontation was, if anything, fun. \\n\\n\r\nI think it lacked quite a bit of tension as the battle never quite felt big, especially since the entire show falls into the Shounen trap of elongating these battle sequences with chatty expository dialogue mid-fight that not only rips me out of the moment, but stretch the believe-ability of the event. I think if Re:Zero would shorten this sequence down by three or maybe even four times, it could create for a more intense, believable, and well-animated battle. \\n\\n\r\nFor shows like Game of Thrones, extended battle sequences work because there is a lot of narrative to cover. Well, that and just generally this is a lot more investment and believe-ability in the characters and setting.  But since the narrative is extremely simple in Re:Zero, there is no reason to have this. The battle episodes have dialogue that is generally contrived filler. Subaru didn\u2019t really do anything apart from catching someone and saving them, and then pointing out an insanely obvious boss mechanic. This mechanic was so clear that it was extremely unbelievable that no one else thought of this. The \u201cno one\u201d I\u2019m of course talking about the political figure that wasn\u2019t one of the two that was portrayed with no shred of moral ground. \\n\\n\r\nKarsten Crusch is a pretty fun character to have on screen, even if her design is a little more uninspired than a lot of the other ones that the show has offered. She\u2019s portrayed as this tactician and mastermind yet missed this mechanic completely, which made it all the clearer that the writer needed a reason to have Subaru be the one that is praised since he\u2019s the protagonist of this show. That being said, it was a fun arc to have. Even if it felt like it was the most filler thing in the show, it was also probably the most fun I\u2019ve had with this show that wasn\u2019t\u2019 the fifteenth episode. Things started to actually look up for Re:Zero. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Anti-climax Within a Climax]\\n\\n\r\nThe show ends in a fairly anti-climactic way. We get an eventual reunion between Emilia and Subaru and the crazy joker gets defeated in a way that would probably feel cathartic to people invested in this story. There was this vague overarching narrative involving the seven deadly sins being represented that never actually felt tangible at all. They just felt like names tacked onto certain characters. Certain people were considered \u201csloth\u201d, yet didn\u2019t act slothful. This got to the point where Subaru points it out but it actually is a serious complaint that the show just glosses over because it was being meta. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few backstories reveals here both about the characters we know and about our protagonist, Subaru, that we could\u2019ve probably figured out if we knew about this vague overarching narrative before it was introduced. I wish foreshadowing was something this show implemented. This isn\u2019t really a bad way to go about things, but I can\u2019t help and feel that it\u2019s a generic route to venture down. \\n\\n\r\nThis show offers a simplistic look at racism as well which serves no purpose other than to give Emilia another reason to get empathy from the viewer. It doesn\u2019t work because it\u2019s like empathizing with a cute pencil. Literally wooden. The racism isn\u2019t ever portrayed in a way that I felt commented on anything apart from, \u201chey, don\u2019t do that.\u201d Which is the most simplistic and obvious way to go about commenting about something that is inherently thought of as a negative. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, we finally get a climax that doesn\u2019t feel too interesting but we get the titular reunion of Subaru and Emilia and it\u2019s everything that you could imagine. An overblown field of grass blowing in the wind with the sun\u2019s rays outlining the characters as Subaru dumps his feelings on Emilia. She of course reciprocates in a nebulous way and the show wraps up. To give an example of this show lacking believability in its relationships I\u2019ll cite one of the characters. During Subaru\u2019s huge emotional confession to Emilia he says something to the extent of, \u201cIf you name ten bad things about yourself, I will name 2,000 things I love about you.\u201d That\u2019s nice in theory, however, I left me asking if he could even name five. I don\u2019t actually think she even has five features, let alone two-thousand. She\u2019s an ultra-hollow character that didn\u2019t appear much in the show. She was a carrot on the stick that is sought after for reasons that aren\u2019t believable. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Subversion, Deconstruction, and a Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nTo return to the very first topic about this show. Is it subversive? Well, no. Not really. It doesn\u2019t work to subvert anything that remotely lies within the narrative heart of these kinds of shows. There is no attempt to deconstruct elements of this archetype. This show relies heavily on meta-commentary as humor, rather than actual commentary on narrative. I can\u2019t say Re:Zero isn\u2019t trying to do this, since I don\u2019t know if it is, but it sure as hell is failing if it is.\\n\\n\r\nI think the plot-holes and narrative leaps this show has are enough to dismiss it, but pile that on top of the miles of pandering content and cloying narrative with unbelievable relationships you get a show that is overrated by a wide audience. That being said, it isn\u2019t without its positives. I appreciate its character design, they fit exactly what this show is trying to do very well. Particularly Emilia and the twin maids have standout designs. The VA\u2019s are also mostly solid, with some great performances by Yuusuke Kobayashi playing Subaru, and Inori Minase as Rem. It also does a few smart things when it comes to presentation. I particularly loved how it avoided the opening credits in some cases to maintain the pace of the narrative. This is something I haven\u2019t seen done in anime much and I\u2019d love to see more shows attempt this. \t\\n\\n\r\nI think Re:Zero shows a glaring flaw in this entire kind of entertainment. A lot of anime can often feel shallow to me. I usually am unable to pinpoint why exactly I\u2019m having trouble connecting to these characters, especially since animation is a medium in which I connect to characters more due to their overt expressiveness. I often ponder this question without ever coming up with an answer, however, I feel like I can finally describe it in maybe an overly simplistic way. \\n\\n\r\nAnime is the only medium in which I hear the term \u201cbest girl\u201d being thrown around. It\u2019s the only kind of entertainment where the quality of one, and only one, sex matters over a lot of significantly more important things for many people. It\u2019s this kind of strange shallowness that is pandered to relentlessly since the industry knows the kind of demographic it\u2019s attempting to appeal to that keeps it from being taken seriously by a lot of people. It is a show like Re:Zero that stretches my ability to consider this as anything but an elaborate ruse to have me spend money because I thought some cartoon girl was pretty and had a cute blush and a childish voice. It appeals to this basic instinct and doesn\u2019t rely on its ability to tell a story. People get bored of watching the same shit, even if that same narrative shit is secondary to how attractive the characters are. So, when they see something like this, which has objective narrative issues, but at least conveys a different kind of mindset, they may view it as something more. Especially since it\u2019s still delivering a barrage of girls acting in a way only anime girls can act. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of whether you think this is an issue or not, I feel like it is a topic that is worth discussing. So, why is subversion needed? To create entertainment that isn\u2019t a slave to an industry. You need subversion because it undermines the power of an established kind of media structure. However, do not confuse subversion with self-awareness or just unexpected outcomes. Being unexpected is simply what a story needs to be if you want it to be engaging. You need to keep things unpredictable to a certain extent if you want to keep the viewers engaged. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is far from a narrative masterpiece that many people may believe it to be. It is, however, a show that tries to defy conventions while still ticking off every checkbox of its clich\u00e9d genre. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve seen many times before yet it plays out with just a few differences that make it something worth remembering just a little. It\u2019s not something that I overtly enjoyed, however, I will say that I will remember my time watching Re:Zero. \\n\\n\r\nI wish that I had more positives to say about the show that was the craze of 2016, however, I also wish it left me with a more positive impression. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll forget Re:Zero, but I can\u2019t really tell why. It\u2019s a piece of entertainment that feels Re:Made countless times, Re:Packaged into different archetypes, Re:Written for different generations, but ultimately remains Un:Inspired. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A breath of fresh air from the overly saturated fantasy anime genre. Say what you will about Re:Zero, but it was able to stand out from the pack by offering an unexpected twist to a story setting which seemed to have been running a repetitive course with previous shows such as SAO, Log Horizon, No Game No Life, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, GATE ect. Not to say any or all of these shows are bad, but many found themselves falling prey to the typical fantasy tropes that seem to plague the genre.\r\nStory 8/10- One of the mostimportant aspects to a show, and Re:Zero does not disappoint. The story follows from the perspective of Natsuki Subaru as he, as the title suggests, starts life in another world. The first few episodes of the show really do well to introduce the world and Subabru's mysterious ability to revert back to a so called \"checkpoint\" in time after dying. The story's focus really ends up being about Subaru's character finding himself, and the reason for him being brought into this world. Was it by chance, is it part of his destiny, is there someone pulling the strings of his fate? Throughout the show's run time the question comes closer to it's fruition, however it is not answered completely by the end, which prevents me from giving story a perfect 10. Also it takes some time for the audience to really understand the overarching plot and to find out what it is all leading up to. Not until perhaps halfway through the show are these questions answered. Still an engaging story from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10- Not much to say here. Some really fun, sometimes over the top character designs, great overall art/animation, a couple breathtaking action scenes, and superb animated character expressions. Really a phenomenal job with conveying character emotions through facial animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10- You can know right away when a show's music really makes an impression. Just thinking back to certain scenes I can recall the impact it had simply by having very strong music to accompany it. I have seen this show almost 3 times, but it has been over a year since my last viewing. I can still remember the intros/outros of both seasons as well as many of the standout songs from the soundtrack. A phenomenal job in this category.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10- Firstly, praise has to be given to the character Natsuki Subaru. A lot of hate is thrown his way by the avid critics of the show. Though not perfect, Subaru is able to start out as your typical over zealous, NEET protagonist, and in the end become a well rounded and confident person that others would aspire to become. I think many who began watching Re:Zero were initially off-put by Subaru's many character tropes and at times annoying personality. It is soon to be revealed that this is but a facade. This overcompensation is due to Subaru's lack of accomplishment and self confidence. Soon it is realized that in his past life he had never amounted to anything. This new fantasy life, seeming to be a dream come true, ends up becoming more so a nightmare and a trial of character, a chance for Subaru to become something he never was. Many of the weaknesses we all see in ourselves come to light in this character, which can make some people watching uncomfortable, but it also makes for some very important messages and self reflection. There are quite a few other stand out characters; Rem, Wilhelm, Petelgeuse, Crusch, Julius. Though the show can feel bogged down with an over abundance of characters, the ones that shine the most are able to be brought into the limelight more often than not. Definitely a strong cast of characters that are all a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10- Once picked up this series is a hard one to put down. Each episode ends on a cliff hanger and is ready to pull you right back in. I can't speak for everyone but for myself the most exciting part of each week was seeing the new Re:Zero episode during its airing. A show to watch just for the experience. At the very least you'll find it a fun time waster. I cannot recommend it enough.\\n\\n\r\nA 9/10, One of the best fantasy anime in years.",

            "content": "Back in Winter 2016, I was looking at the PV for the next season and to be honest, Re Zero didn't get my attention at all. So I started to watch it pretty late, after people started to praise the anime and that's important since it's mean the show must have some good points. In the end, the best way to find out is to take a look and give me an opinion by myself. The one hour first episode was undoubtedly a good idea as they could introduce enough to catch people interest without giving a feeling of frustration or things beeing rushed. Thefist part was intressting and well balanced so I didn't get bored until Subaru arrive to the mansion. \\n\\n\r\nSo after a nice introduction we are at episode 4 and his 22 minutes of cheesy, boring slice of life. I cloud hardly hide my disapointement, the ending song began and I was about to close the media player as Suburu falling asleep but this very pleasant cliffhanger changed everythings. Why ? How ? Who ? I honestly didn't see that comming. At this point I learned something important : watch Re Zero until the last the second. Each episode for this arc add something surprising that hooked me until the end.\\n\\n\r\nWith the begining of the new arc, the show's name change to become Rem:Zero. At first we can just laugh at how a supportive character get much more developped that the \"main girl\" but I really liked Rem's developpement and she is, in my opinon, one of the main reason behind the success of Re:Zero. Of course we could say that she has a lot of screentime but that only is not enough to put her on the throne of \"best girl of the serie\" or even of the year. Personnaly I think she is worthy of the best female supportive character award. Why ? \\n\r\nHer character devlopement and the way she shines as a support for the main character are the answer. She becomes an important factor in Subaru's every success and their relationship is something rare enough in anime industry to mention it. Looking at those two make me think of the Araragi Koyomi / Hanekawa Tsubasa relationship. Something deep, very difficult to expres with words and maybe a bit spiritual. By the way, please take note that the only time Subaru kill himself is to save Rem, interesting for a guy which is afraid to die. \\n\r\nSo yeah Rem grows as a character and the viewer can't help but fall for her thanks to that ep 15. This episode is an important turning point in the series with all the different feeling it addresses. Short but satisfying fight scene, violent death, (super) crazy saddist, some emotional words and a beautiful but sad ending. White Fox doing great here by making a special ending which feet perfectly to the mood of the episode. Of course, since I talking about Rem, I have to speak about ep 18, you agree don't you ? The one is a simple 24 minutes of how to become the best girl. It's hard to belive that having only two people speaking can make a such entertaining moment. \\n\r\nFrist Subaru have a profond relexion on himself and finally realize is own condition which is a bit unusual, painful and satisfying at the same time. On the other side we have Ren which deliver the best love confession I've seen for a while and that super effective title drop add the last piece on this well-build episode with a large panel of feeling. We can praise Minase Inori for her performance (insert song + voice actress).\\n\\n\r\nActually, could we give these seiyus an award or something. They really did a great job with those characters's voice and I can't imagine watching Re Zero in my native languge anymore. I pity the poor guy who will have to voice Betelgeuse, I mean, Matsuoka Yoshitsugu's performance is just unbeatable. Gambatte random dude. \\n\r\nAlso you can't deny the job done by Whitefox. I loved the way they played with openning and ending like poping the opening song in the middle because it's fit the fight scene. Moreover, she show was a 25 ep run without break and we all know that production issues are very likly to happen here but the quality through the end doensn't decrease (well a tiny bit but it's okay).\\n\\n\r\nWARNING spoilers ahead so if you didn't watch the show, stop reading here ! There is three things I want to talk about as they can be concidered as flaws.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, ep 18 after an awemsome declaration, Rem got rejected. You may say it's stupid, Emilia is useless and Rem is awesome. Subaru is an idiot to still choising Emila. While I agree that Rem, at this moment, is the best logicial choice but love doesn't work that way. Sabaru really loves Emilia and Rem really loves Subaru too. That's why he rejected her and that why she simply anwser \"yes\". She already knows she'd got rejected but she still by his side. Don't forget that Subaru got rejected frist, Rem ins't selfush enough to accept Subaru's proposition without thinking about his own happiness.\\n\r\nThen you may also say Subaru should killing himself when he is too much in trouble. Seriously ? I mean this would be a cheap trick and would destroy the charm of the story and I don't like that. Look at the two time (1 in anime and 1 un wn) where Subaru killed himself ? For the sake of Rem. And I truly want to belive that there is a symbolism behind those suicides. Hell yeah, he can live without Rem #FanBoyON #TeamRem #RemBestGirl (well sorry about that)\\n\r\nFinal point is the end... That I know don't give me this \"you don't say / people die when they are killed\" look, I have no idea how to say it otherwise. Yeah it's way too chessy. I would loved to see and ending like \"We have to tell Rem that we won\" ... black screen ... \"Subaru-kun... who's Rem ?\" THE END. Buuut as the studio doesn't know if they will produce a second season one day, it's way better to don't end on a cliffhanger avoid a frustration of the fan. I can't blame them for that.",

            "content": "You know, for all the shit I give visual novels, I'll say this about them: at least they have the decency to fucking end when it comes time for them to expire. Light novels, on the other hand, never seem to be written with an end goal in mind. Every single one I've seen tries to be the otaku pandering version of a Shonen Jump manga (well, more otaku pandering than Shonen Jump already is) and as I've made it very clear before, I'm not into on-going stories, especially when they have the straightforward nature of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. I grewup on movies and novels my school made me read, so I'm used to things having a beginning, middle, and end, especially when said end give birth to a bunch of shitty sequels that make you want to castrate the entirety of Hollywood's population. And it'd be one thing if they had the substance of a (really good) live-action drama, but I've yet to see Hannibal: The Light Novel version come from Japan, let alone be as successful as that show.\\n\\n\r\nSitting through Holo and Lawrence flirting with each other whilst mostly ignoring the reason why they started traveling together to begin with might be your idea of a good time, but there's only so long a bunch of Tales skits are going to entertain me when you rely on them for substance. Oh, but these interactions are what allows us to care about the characters so that when the drama hits...in which case I stop you right there and tell you that philosophy can fuck right off. Yes you need to develop the characters, but you're not supposed to put the story on halt in order to do that. If you can't meld the character interactions with the plot, then you might as well have not had them at all. But then again, I didn't grow up on superhero comics or anything otaku-related like a lot of anime fans (especially these days), so maybe it's just a style of storytelling that's not meant for me. Just like idol shows. Or anime about bread.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is though, even by those incredibly bizarre Marvel-esque standards, Re:Zero still isn't very good. And it's not just because I hate meta-humor, although that's certainly a big part of it. Despite what Digibro might tell you, anime has always been lazy in regards to being meta, but it's definitely gotten a lot worse in the last few years, and I'm getting really annoyed by how inward anime is starting to become as a medium in general with popular light novel shows like Saekano and even anime video games like Danganronpa. The main character is an otaku - which in theory is supposed to make him relatable to everyone but in practice would only make him relatable to anime nerds (which I am not) - and every time he brings up how something is just like one of those anime he watches, I wanted to reach into the screen and beat him to death with his own face for not realizing that for comedy relief to work, you need to have comedy and something to relieve.\\n\\n\r\nAnd he keeps quoting anime tropes even when he's in danger. Hell, even the other characters occasionally join him on his nerdy rants despite video games and harpoon guns not existing in the world. It'd be one thing if Re:Zero was a comedy anime, but nothing about the premise is inherently comedic. No one wants to be the Pirate King in a world where pirates have superpowers. Nothing about the fantasy setting screams Tex Avery and none of the characters make Hanna Barbara sound-effects whenever they breathe. Very few of the jokes are even fantasy-related, so why the hell do I have to sit through a speech regarding the glory of the maid? I don't give a shit about maids. Especially not when characters are in the midst of getting burnt alive by a raging inferno.\\n\\n\r\nBut even if you did become infected with the same sort of fatal disease that all Romeo Tanaka fans have, the story is like every other light novel story ever in that it's \"light\" (which in my mind translates to \"incredibly boring\"), and has all the storytelling quality of Dragon Age II - another shitty fantasy product. It's about this otaku dude with no past and no reason to be the lead that's not circumstantial named Subaru, as he one days get transported to a strange fantasy world for some witch-related reason that's never really elaborated on and falls in love with a half-elf princess named Emilia because the plot says so. However, the two of them end up as bloody corpses thanks to a mysterious female assassin, only for Subaru to discover that he has the ability to go back in time, Majora's Mask-style every time he dies. But this is just the setup. Where did this power come from? What overarching plot comes from it? Who's the main villain? Where's the grand adventure that usually accompanies these fantasy worlds? What exactly is Re:Zero about?\\n\\n\r\nWell unfortunately, there isn't a single thing Re:Zero is \"about\" that appeals to anyone who's not an anime nerd or a Fire Emblem fan that disagrees with me that the franchise has turned bloody awful since the console releases. Every single character seems to be written with the mindset of \"ship first, characterize second\", and they all seem to change personality depending on what the plot wants to do with Subaru. Want to torture the dude? Let's have everyone hate him. Done with the torture? Okay, let's have everyone be nice to him now for no good reason. The only meaningful interactions Subaru has in the show are with the two love-interests: Emilia and a blue-haired maid named Rem, who people seemed to like an awful lot once she lost all her personality after becoming attracted to our rough otaku lead. Apparently, this is because the less your know about a person, the easier it is to ship them. A rule that I seem to recall being completely untrue during my brief shipping phase, but what do I know about what's cool these days?\\n\\n\r\nAnd the plot and dialogue have about as much momentum as a Pro Stock car super-glued to a garbage crusher. It starts with Subaru getting introduced to his time travel powers, the characters, and an evil female villain we never see again in a plotline that screams \"obvious setup\" in capital lines and enough exclamation marks to fill the Atlantic Ocean. Three, technically four, episodes later and I still don't understand where the show is going with all this. So Subaru is going to move in with Emilia? Why should I care? Where's the story going to go from there? Well the next arc answers this question through a plot line of a mysterious killer in Emilia's mansion that might have acted as a tense mystery if the slice-of-life scenes weren't so utterly canned and the acting wasn't so hammy. But even if they weren't, the end boss turns out to be nothing more than a pack of dogs you could have defeated by chucking a fucking bone at them, and all it amounts to at the end is Subaru getting closer to Rem while having some lap pillow time with Emilia when he can be assed. We're halfway through the series and it's been nothing but prologue material that'd make the seventh Harry Potter movie blush.\\n\\n\r\nBut eventually, after sitting through twelve episodes of boring character interactions that were only that long because of the show's utterly stupid usage of its time travel gimmicks, the anime pulls a Shyamalan and gets into what it's really about. A self-loathing prideful dude whose shittiness destroys everything and everyone around him as a sort of deconstruction of the traditional shonen protagonist/trapped in a foreign world/anime in general storytelling. Basically Danganronpa 3: Despair Arc, except with a strange obsession for physically torturing Subaru repeatedly in order to fulfill the two-cour order to the point that it gets ridiculous, whereas Danganronpa Despair generally made the brutal killings of its anime tropes nice and quick bar the most important death scene, which stood out because it happened to that character and said character stayed dead. Listen show, I'm pretty sure I got that Subaru's prideful nature is toxic to humanity after you killed his ass to the point that his body literally broke apart. You didn't need to repeat it five fucking times with the only difference between each time being the method you used to do so and dedicating one episode to each time. Twice would have been sufficient, because the first time might have just demotivated him a bit, but other than that, this is is an anime. Not the Japanese version of American politics.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really annoyed me with this \"true plot\" though is that all the torture amounts to at the end of the day is just to give our male lead an incentive to be a better person, which is the fucking white noise of how to do character development, whereas any good writer would have made the general direction from there a lot more bittersweet, or if you're Hideaki Anno, fucking brutal. But because Re:Zero's usage of time travel can conveniently erase a character's death whenever it wants to and make people forget how much of an asshole our lead is (and when they don't, they really easily forgive him), it makes all the effort put into depicting a twisted arm pretty pointless unless you really seeing torture porn animated. Not helping at all is that the actual torture is kind of lame and unimaginative. Nothing but bone-crunching and bleeding eyeballs, which - compared to Danganronpa's ridiculously creative death traps - just looks like the majority of the show's action scenes aka really bad. There's some decent animation in the fights sometimes, but they're either one-sided, badly choreographed, or shot to the point that you don't actually see the blows land. I know a lot of people talk up the white whale stuff, but I don't think the whales actually attacked anyone short of breathing on them, and I'm pretty sure Wilhelm's moves were the only ones that actually made contact.\\n\\n\r\nSo the show really never amounts to nothing more than making the viewer feel \"emotions\", which is something the creative team seems to be very much aware of because all the budget seems to go into the \"hard-hitting stuff\", causing the animation during the clean-up phase of Re:Zero's tale with the actual fighting and resolutions to look like absolute ass. The final scene is nothing more than a cheesy love confession with the screen brightness turned up and looks nowhere near as good as any of the climaxes in Episodes 13-18. And it didn't help that when all is said and done, all that happened was that Subaru went through \"character development\" to become a better man. But why? What was the point in watching that? Character development for the sake of character development can't function on its own as substance, and certainly not when the end goal of it is to be a better man for a girl who didn't even have that much screen time and whose half-elf heritage doesn't even factor all that much into the plot other than to be a convenient conflict. You do realize that I could just buy Tales of Symphonia at my local retail store, right?\\n\\n\r\nI liked Danganronpa 3 because it used being \"anime\" ironically as well as a weapon to corrupt its well-meaning protagonists and their individual philosophies into a bunch of murderers where the only way to cheat death was if the writer was in a trolling mood, and Re:Zero's \"anime\" nature just feels incredibly lackluster by comparison. The only reason Subaru goes through any sort of shit is so that he can overcome the whiny drama and be rewarded with a personality-less girl who has no chemistry with him ala a shitty JRPG. And the only way he overcomes something is due to someone saving him at the last minute or becoming a little braver after suffering a traumatic event, which is also the kind of thing that characterizes most shitty JRPGs. When characters got corrupted in Danganronpa 3, they had to deal with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life, generally by staying corrupted or put into a computer simulation for the rest of their days. And most of all, love interests died as a result of their actions and stayed dead! Things stuck in those shows. And whatever interesting point Re:Zero brings up is always invalidated before too long, like a happy marriage after the honeymoon is over.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final point though, I don't know who voiced Subaru, but his voice is annoying as fuck. There were several episodes where it became too much for me to the point that I had to mute the video just to get through it, and this includes Episode 18 where I only got through the first two minutes with sound. Just because you're supposed to be a deconstruction of the alpha male doesn't mean you have to sound like a whiny bitch. And don't even get me started on the final villain. I'm pretty sure you could make a funky remix out of every annoying Kugimiya Rie character verbal tic she's ever done and it'd still be more listenable than watching Kirito orgasm at the sound of his voice.",

            "content": "\"In the story, Subaru Natsuki is an average high school student who is lost in an alternate world where he is rescued by a pretty silver haired girl. He is near her to return the favor, but the fate she is charging is more But he only remembers what happened in the past, but he is not the only one who can not tell what he's going to do.\"\r\nThe work begins as a simple fantasy work, with the theme of escapism for another world with adventure and comedy, being something lighter most of the time during this season but still having its most exciting moments,heavy, adventures and everything very well balanced .\\n\\n\r\nThe series captures the attention of the public, at the beginning with its mysteries, the plot with its twists and unpredictability, surprising the audience with each new episode - usually with calmer episodes as a whole, but with an impact ending with a good hook for Hold the audience for another week to find out exactly what happened. What appeared to be something clich\u00e9 at the end really was, had its heaviest and dramatic moments, with the author playing with the despair and disgrace of the characters, but never doing something irreversible, which does not provide a real climate that the characters could actually be in Danger, because our protagonist could use his magic and solve everything, returning everything to normal and solving all problems with a lot of coaxing sometimes this for 25 episodes, but I am not criticizing or saying that the series was bad I am merely analyzing the facts that I have seen, but I will consider your quality soon.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout this journey, Subaru had its many moments of downfall, and only managed to be really heroic, serving as a catalyst for others who are stronger and more qualified to help in a certain situation, simply Subaru was the joker of the game and moved the right pieces So as to be on your side to help you, well there we have a differential because we are somewhat accustomed to characters more OP - Overpawer - able to do everything alone but still has help, or with the power to solve everything to destroy planets , Or be smart to use his few skills in a useful way, here we have a common protagonist, and seemingly normal, with nothing special outside his ability, even he being able to contribute he ends up totally dependent on his allies to deal with enemies with levels of Power away from yours. He could contribute to the defeat of the obstacle of a certain bow, but he did not really manage to make the final blow from himself except in a more emotional sense, since when he tried to interfere directly, it was almost certain that they would reach a Bad End. Being altogether a useless personage and that was the focus of much discussion, causing problems by its psychological that turns out to be unstable. Only in the final arcs of the series shows its evolution as a character, after a long period of regression, showing how a character should not be, and from one moment to another from what we can call Zero point in the series where Is defined as his \"redemption\" - Rem 's miraculous opponents - into Rem' s arms - with a poor heart broken - he decides to rebuild and change, as the series evolves in a fast and fluid way and the protagonist was following his own pace, But slowly, until then it would be alright, but we have a sudden change - literally it's like another character there - with the author trying to make the Subaru more heroic and bigger, turning a nobody into a general capable of commanding troops, arm A good plan, and start using the intelligence that was lost while having your moments like a weeping coward, but being a sudden change from one episode to another, I found your change somewhat forced and attitudes to, is a series of detail like others who have some inconsistency, but worth it stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe series had a lot of great and truly dramatic moments, being one of the best parts of the anime, its drama scenes or with a certain emotional load, or more tense and psychological, which shows very well done, and already in the part Of the action is OK, but not yet all that, with an attempt to be something more \"epic\" a soundtrack so and at more crucial times is usually used Opening, which shows a lack of repertoire.\\n\\n\r\nSo, while the peak season was their middle, the end is still strong enough, being a much lighter end in comparison to the series as a whole, leaving a cute end of fantasy anime, which was different than expected By me, with a more correct and closed end, still leaving some mysteries and inconsistencies, but well closed, with loopholes for a new season, but at the same time giving to close there, at least I did not feel the need of more of this anime by Now, and left some deleted characters at the end of the series excluding or showing them leaving vacant as they ended up off the protagonist and his pair - which left open after the confession of Subaru putting him more as a friend and his outstanding response deserved.\\n\\n\r\nWell it really lacked a certain highlight or development more the Emilia Character, who disappeared for almost every anime and when it comes back little if it is revealed, well nothing that a Second season be made could not solve, but still is a detail to speak as well as another Who also gained little prominence and disappeared in the last Arscos Roseawlrd.\\n\\n\r\nTechnical / Art:\\n\\n\r\nWith an animation in the most fluid part, and with good quality, bringing beautiful scenes, with an excellent visual production, still innovating and bringing different scenes, using very well the color scheme according to the context, going from something more epic with scenarios Very well constructed to something darker and darker, which conveys well what the scenes want to pass, in addition to small parts and details with their symbolisms that may go unnoticed but are there.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation remains constant even with its small amount, and it may fall a little in some parts or episodes for us to bring a show in the following episode and when neseario.A art besides very good it is also worth emphasizing the desining of the characters that was very Well produced, and with that during that season we had countless anime arts in different places all very good - there were so many and so good that I had to bring some in my weekly analyzes.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack / soundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nA strong point of the anime for me, simply very good, providing a better experience and contributing a lot to the anime as a whole, as already commented, being beautiful in moments of emotion, and simply very good in more sombre momentsproporcionarando more emotion with the Scenes. Another point worth highlighting are the seyus of anime that are to be congratulated for their great work, simply great as I already commented in the analysis, one part was the soundtrack and another was the seyus themselves - for those who do not know the term Would be the voice actors - bringing great acting providing more reality the scenes becoming serious and mature, great voices, among them we have:\\n\\n\r\nEmilia - Takahashi, Rie\\n\r\nSubaru - Kobayashi, Yuusuke\\n\r\nBeatrice - Arai, Satomi\\n\r\nPetelgeuse Roman\u00e9e-Conti - Matsuoka, Yoshitsugu\\n\r\nRem - Murakawa, Rie\\n\r\nRam - Minase, Inori\\n\\n\r\nConclusion / Opinion:\\n\\n\r\nThis was a great work with its ups and downs, had its inconsistencies, but nothing that disrupts the development of the work, had its good moments too, along with I followed it I did not get to feel so attached to it, but still I did not stop Appreciates it every episode with its suppresses and twists in the plot, its mysteries that trapped me and made me theorize, their answers that suggest even more history forward that made me want more, and the inevitable spoilers that is received throughout the season Which makes me rethink about a second season and that could turn out to be something good.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout this 25-episode journey, I really liked how some characters worked, like the sisters Rem and Ram - or would it be Ram and Rem? - his Story and past his interaction in the anime with his nasty comments, and fun moments that we brought, I really enjoyed both - even more of Ram - and many in that time must have fallen in love with Rem, and his love story with the protagonist And if revolted at the result, about the Romance I found it good that at least Subaru remained firmly determined and faithful, not betraying or deceiving Rem, but still very little is known about his sister and her relationship with Roseawrld. We also had Emilia a still vague character but very little view but proving the opposite of her initial impression of a maiden being saved, to a Badass girl who knows how to defend herself. The main villain of the plot was the witch Satella herself surrounded by mysteries and the Dragon, but in these arcs beyond the development of characters and emotional obstacles the two major obstacles were the White Whale and Peteguelse Romani-Conti - I think I wrote it right - the whale Was a difficult enemy his bow was very well worked, bringing memories of other characters developments and highlight to some, and opportunity to continue the story well being the point where Subaru could prove itself. Already Petelguelse, ended up being a villain more cartoons, with their faces and mouths, having truly cruel actions, but for me being a more hilarious personage by their gestures and features their attitudes were not a real danger, but something more cartoonish and not so Deep little we have seen about him besides his blind devotion, his lack of love and his diligence for a lazy, and his Gospel that is in possession of Subaru and little is known either.\\n\\n\r\nIs this work worth seeing? Yes for those who like a good fantasy anime that can trap you surprise, that can bring you high emotions and that is like a roller coaster, where probably you will be taken to extremes, may create some grudge against the protagonist or forgive him , If you like the genres is also a good request, if you are looking for some good anime to see and spend time, and you will be surprised to see it as something else. The Work, as I have already mentioned, had its pros and cons as well as any other work, for those who find the protagonist a hindrance, it can really be drawn the series, because it takes a long time to see its change, and little is given to cling to it, nor I enjoyed it so much, but otherwise it's a wonderful and charming work if not up to the point, with well-crafted characters and all very well done, who may come to make you love them - others being forgotten - a unique work that brought Some things I have not seen for some time we animes may have been a fashion of the season, but still can not deny its quality, I recommend it without doubts, I enjoyed seeing it and I do not regret it, it was a pleasure and a distress analyze - every week, to have to wait for the next one the emotion of wanting more, and the feelings that each episode brings you, this is the type of work that I recommend to be marathon of - view all in sequence - taking all the episodes together to have a Best experience even Endo a little coiled at times and delayed purposely only to have the same conclusion episodes of more excitement ahead this also came to be a plus point of the series - against the protagonist, who of all his defects presented and were not few at least had The courage to want to improve, and in the end did what he should have done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor some it will be a series perhaps unforgettable that fades with time, but it will always be in the heart, I do not think it will be something so unforgettable maybe soon it will be able to fade, but still I will keep its memory somewhere, because without a doubt it was a unique anime , And with its open end, but still well closed even missing several pieces for this puzzle may be likely another season even if it takes, or can stop where it is, but then I can rest assured that only this season already with this great end - well I still think the end could have been better - could please many.\\n\\n\r\nEvaluation:\\n\\n\r\nDirection: 7.5\\n\r\nScript / History: 7.5\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 8\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5\\n\r\nCharacters: 6.5\\n\r\nInterruption: 7\\n\r\nFinal grade: 8\\n\\n\r\nWho did not see wanted to see?

            "content": "Re:Zero is an interesting anime that brings about a cool concept.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is extremely interesting, about a boy, Subaru, who exits the convenience store and suddenly ends up in another world. He is cornered in alley but is saved by a girl, Satella. He follows her on her quest to retrieve her insignia, something that is very important to her. They arrive at a house in the slums, and get killed. However, the boy comes back to life, but in the past. He can start over from zero.\r\nI quite enjoyed the story, as you never know when Subaru can finally pass the stage wherehe can't get past and keeps dying, it adds a lot of suspense. He has to figure out ways to get past the problems blocking his way from survival. At some points, the story can turn a little sad too. The character interactions were also rather interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what I didn't like is that some questions were not answered in the end. Of course, it's possible that there'll be a Season 2, but what we have now in the anime isn't enough to understand some stuff, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art and animation is really cool and nice. The colours used are great and nice to look at. I quite like the art style as well. The effects are also pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI love all the OPs and EDs, they are really beautiful and enjoyable. The music in the anime itself is also really nice and helps to create the atmosphere. The voice acting was brilliant, and the seiyuus were able to flesh out the characters really well and bring them to life, with different expressions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nAt first I didn't really like Subaru's personality, but I grew to like it over the course of the anime. There are also some other characters that I don't really like, but I don't think whether you like the characters or not affects your overall enjoyment of the anime. I didn't find any of them overly whiny, flawed or way too perfect. (ok maybe Reinhard, but still) The character designs all look very good and independent to build up more of the character. Character chemistry and relationships were also pretty good. There was some character development for a few of the characters, and some of them were revealed to have rather interesting backstories. I don't think there were too many characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nIt's extremely enjoyable, even though some parts are there to make you cringe, most of the time it is rather easy to laugh at what is happening. The fights are epic, and you never know what might happen next. The tension is great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nOverall I really do recommend this anime to everyone, especially those who like psychological fantasy anime. It is quite enjoyable and definitely not a waste of your time!\\n\\n\r\nI hope this helped! :)",

            "content": "WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS.\r\nIt should be treated more as a critique for those who have already finished or do not plan to watch the show and are browsing for opinions, rather than a \"Should You Watch\".\r\nINTRO: Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu. At one point, I had high hopes for this series. It was announced to much fanfare and excitement from source Light Novel readers who hailed it as an intelligent deconstruction of the Isekai (Parallel World (typically) fantasy) genre/setting, oft-mocked for being oversaturated by mediocre tales of self-insertable Gary Stus flung into fantasy worlds and quickly finding themselves with a harem and overpoweredabilities. Despite this, I should point out that I generally bear no ill will towards Isekai series despite these criticisms, and have no issues enjoying them if they are executed well enough. Overall though, I do agree that the genre is laden with tired tropes, and I was looking forward to seeing how Re:Zero would topple or at least subvert them as advertised. Unfortunately, that is not quite what I got out of it.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this series was certainly a unique experience. I struggle to remember the last time such a well-received anime so utterly baffled me in the complete disconnect between its supposed intent and its delivery (with perhaps the sole exception at the time of writing being the first season of Oregairu, though that is a story for another day). It is a story with so many blatant contradictions woven into that I could not help but assume that it was a deliberately satirical work, and yet it is clearly meant to be taken at face value. Were it not for the comparatively exciting and entertaining presentation of the first arc in episodes 1 through 3, I would have most assuredly give this show a sum score of 1/10. That is how much ill will I hold towards this show and its betrayal of expectations. It is so consummately deplorable that I feel compelled to waste my time writing this, my first MAL review. Though I have heard various opinions regarding the quality of the anime adaptation versus the light novel, I will be treating the show as an independent product with no comparisons to source material. Contradiction and contrast, as I said before, is the name of the game here, and will be the central themes of this review.\\n\\n\r\nART AND ANIMATION: Let's begin here. In the typical anime, particularly one with fight scenes, the quality of the art and animation is understandably expected to fluctuate due to time and budget constraints. The greatest peaks can be expected to occur during the attention-grabbing climactic episodes of the first arc and last arc, with smaller peaks throughout. However, that is not what happened in this series. Though the animation in episode 3 (the end of the first arc) has some particularly striking moments, it is in fact one of the only episodes I would label as noteworthy throughout the entire show. There are many instances throughout the series of significant scenes that are weakened by lack of detail and/or fluidity. The series also makes ample use of CG elements, such as the crowds in towns, that do not blend in well at all. Most viewers, myself included, would likely forgive this, simply assuming that they are conserving their resources for another set piece moment. Yet... that moment never comes. No battle scene ever comes close to that of episode 3, in animation or even in dramatic tension. After it was all over, I felt cheated, as though I had been bait-and-switched by episode 3 and its glimmer of potential, waiting for a return to form that simply never arrived.\\n\\n\r\nApart from more objective qualms, the series also makes very heavy use of less-than-subtle visual metaphors and direction cues in an attempt to stir emotion. Examples include: supposedly emotional moments being punctuated by rays of light and brightness filters that look like they would be right at home on Instagram or a JJ Abrams film, a single flower conveniently left blooming on the barren battlefield to segue into a floral-themed flashback scene, frequent use of flashback flickers in almost any conversation where past events are even lightly touched upon, and a literal flock of doves during a particularly forced emotional scene. While not dealbreaking flaws, these heavy-handed additions certainly detracted from my viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND DESIGN AND MUSIC: The series often opted to skip the OP, the ED, or both, presumably in an ill-advised attempt to cram in more dialogue or events into each episode, so I never got particularly attached to any of them. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the OPs and EDs more were they actually played more than about 3 times each in their respective single cour runs of 12-13 episodes. This was especially evident when the show went for \"OP drops\" during critical scenes, and I would suddenly hear a vaguely familiar song I had not heard in several episodes, not realizing for several moments when I had heard it before. In my opinion, the decision to shun the general convention of ~1:30 Opening > ~20 Minute Episode > ~1:30 Ending is not something that should be taken lightly, as eschewing the traditional restrictions on the medium in a \"director's cut\" fashion often leads to issues with pacing or bloat, along with the aforementioned issues of song memorability. It's a shame, because they were fairly unique as far as OP/ED tracks go. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the OST, a few tracks were of note, but their impact was often dulled due to being used in conjunction with the heavy-handed visual direction I was not a fan of. In those same scenes where the lighting was turned up to max, more emotionally charged music tracks would be played at a noticeably higher volume than the usual. In many scenes, I found myself irritated and distracted that the show was TELLING me how to feel about what was going on on-screen instead of allowing me to form my own opinions. It was almost as though the show was accompanied by a commentator shouting at me \"Hey! Look, this scene is sad!\" or \"Oh man! Things are getting heated!\" at regular intervals. Most shows do this to some extent, and it is difficult to describe in words why exactly this show in particular was so egregious, but the real problems came when what the show was telling me to feel directly contradicted with how I was actually feeling about the scene.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: The premise of Re:Zero is actually quite interesting. The \"hero\" is thrust into the fantasy world, but does not possess any hidden overpowered talents. He has the ability to reset, but not without very serious drawbacks. Subaru wishes to be just like the heroes of typical Isekai stories, in self-referential meta fashion, but finds himself grossly underprepared to do so, and this is how the story begins. The first arc, the Auction House Arc, is very fast-paced and clear-cut. As Subaru awakens in the new world, he has several immediate issues that need resolving. First, getting his bearings in an unfamiliar environment. Second, discovering and understanding his \"Return by Death\" ability. And third, discovering and preventing the sinister threat lurking at the auction house. Though I have my complaints of how Emilia is introduced and immediately converted into a forced plot device with whom Subaru is instantly infatuated with and motivated to act for, the conflict is developed organically from there, with these three elements introduced and expanded upon simultaneously in a fairly sensible manner. This is, without a doubt, the peak of Re:Zero's storytelling. Sadly, as the show goes on, the plot becomes progressively less focused, less interesting, and more longwinded with each new arc. The second arc, the Mansion/Maid Arc, has two main conflicts, the mystery of the curse and the mystery of the killer with the flail. By the end of the arc, it's clear that both conflicts had very little impact on the plot and world as a whole. Instead, they were meant as character development for Subaru and the new characters, especially Rem. It's not necessarily a bad thing for a show to treat overall plot progression within an arc as a secondary to character development. However, that is only true if the character development is interesting or satisfying in some way, or if it helps to develop sympathy for a character's situation.\\n\\n\r\nIt is very difficult to sympathize with Subaru in this arc, despite his gruesome deaths and mounting paranoia. Throughout the arc, Subaru's rapidly unraveling mental stability as he is struggling to make sense of why he keeps \"resetting\" is conceptually interesting, if not perfectly executed. However, it is difficult to truly root for Subaru when he makes a point of making exceptionally rude comments to almost every individual he meets for the first time, and enjoys showboating and generally making himself appear highly suspect during a canonically tense time where everyone is wary of spies and traitors. It is also hard to feel surprised or sympathetic when Subaru finds himself dismayed and shocked at the mistrust -- and worse -- that he receives. This is compounded by the extremely harsh contrast between drama and awful \"humor\" in some episodes, as well as Subaru's panic being portrayed through his increasingly frequent, very loud, very grating, false displays of bravado. I understood what they were going for, but it doesn't feel natural or well-done at all. On the other hand it's also quite difficult to see why Subaru feels so attached so quickly to those antagonizing him, despite having little to no significant conversation with them. His shift from utter fear and distrust to gratitude and compassion is so abrupt and ill-considered that it's more comical than the show's actual attempts at humor. This will be elaborated upon in the Characters section.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (cont): The third arc, the Whale/Cultist arc, is by far the longest of the three. And yet, there are again only two or three main conflicts, and they certainly aren't any more compelling or developed than those of the second arc even given the extra runtime. Not only does this arc quickly introduce and abandon the Royal Selection subplot, which is the first truly significant event that could move the overall story forward, it takes an entire cour to tell its story, if it can be called that. By the end of the arc it did not feel like much ground had been covered at all, even compared to the first arc, which had perhaps a quarter of the runtime, if that. This is where my dislike of the \"director's cut\" approach comes in. The frequent cutting of the OP and ED was presumably done to fit in more story, so it is baffling to see how much time was actually wasted on drawn out exposition and repetition. Several antagonists are revealed in this arc, all tied to the Jealous Witch and her Cult, but are all either so uninteresting or so over-the-top villainous that it is really difficult to care at all about what is happening. The way the resets are presented, each antagonist is introduced and reintroduced several times before the conflict is resolved, taking away all gravity from their final appearances. Even the final battle of the series is underwhelming, and not just because of the fairly unimpressive animation, as mentioned earlier, but because that enemy had already shown up and been \"defeated\" multiple times in rather anti-climactic fashion, draining all potential excitement for his last duty as a jobber. Even after all of the conflicts are resolved, the finale of the third arc, much like the second arc, leaves the overall progression of the plot at nearly the same place that it began. There is some minor development of character relationships between Subaru and the side characters, most of which consists of Subaru making them hate him, and then trying to make amends, but that's all. By the end, we know about as much of the world, Subaru's \"condition\", and the motivations of each important character as we did when they were introduced.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, that still is not the worst of it. Despite the fact that, episode for episode, the story of the second cour moves quite slowly in comparison to the first and does not contribute to the plot progression, it still somehow feels rushed. Along the way, Subaru spends a significant portion of each episode rebounding between drowning in self-loathing and defeat, to soaring on hubris and bombast. These mood swings into depression are typically triggered by yet another death, which by this point in the series are tossed out like candy and are harder to care about each time. Each time this happens Subaru then receives a pep talk from a character who notices his despair, which cheers him up until the next soul-crushing event happens. I would estimate that, on average, each episode in the second cour contains 1-2 such pep talks, with the final speech-giver tally including almost every side character of any significance. This gets repetitive quickly and takes up quite a bit of runtime. Despite this series getting two cours, two extra-long episodes for the intro and finale, and skipping the majority of its OPs and EDs, conflict resolution still feels rushed. Every time an issue was resolved for good, I found myself questioning if that was really it. All of these factors combine in a way that, when viewed as a whole, gives the feeling of a story that hits the ground running, but then spends two cours slowly choking and grinding to a painfully dull stop.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Suffice it to say, I felt that the characterization in this anime was some of the worst I have ever experienced in any medium, and certainly not remotely worthy of being hailed as deconstructive or subversive where tropes are concerned. In fact, the characters I enjoyed watching the most were mainly just entertaining side characters that had very little plot relevance, such as Wilhelm, Beatrix, and Ram. This is because, paradoxically, the more personal interaction a character had with Subaru, the less sensible or developed they felt as a character. Then there are characters such as Felix, whose crossdressing habits seem to be purely for viewer pandering towards fans of \"trap\" character. There is not the slightest hint towards progressive themes or rationale that could suggest otherwise and make Felix an interesting character, an odd choice for a show supposedly avoiding typical character tropes. To make things easier on myself, I will split the focus of this section into three pieces for the characters I believe shoulder the burden for the vast majority of the criticism I can level against this series: Emilia, Rem, and, of course, Subaru.\\n\\n\r\nEMILIA: Emilia truly bordered the line between main heroine and non-character. Despite the series repeatedly pointing out that she is an independent and powerful Spirit Arts user who is more than capable of defending herself, the way she is presented in the series is not all that different from a damsel in distress. These are the main facets of her character: Subaru's savior who was the first to reach out to him (this is the peak of her character, and it lasts for exactly one episode -- the first episode); Subaru's ideal girl that he wants to get closer to; the girl Subaru most wants to save from danger (this is the most common way she is presented and is a major motivator for Subaru throughout the show); the girl who sometimes acts cold, but is actually just suffering due to prejudice that Subaru wishes to defend her from; the girl who gets angry at Subaru but has a soft spot for him and is inwardly worried sick about him. There is an obvious common thread between all of these. Emilia's character, despite the show's protest to the contrary, is solely defined by what Subaru is doing at any given moment, and how his actions relate to her wellbeing. She is treated essentially as the trophy Subaru wishes to win for his victory against cruel fate. While she is not particularly unlikable, she is also far too pristine and unbelievably irreproachable to be compelling. Everything that Emilia is simply comes together to form the \"perfect\" heroine for Subaru to fight for, and she is never developed beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nREM: As much as Emilia was a forced \"perfect\" heroine and romantic interest candidate, Rem is a thousand times more so. She is introduced without much characterization at all, and what characterization we first get is that she truly hates Subaru. She resents Subaru who has shown up and taken up residence in her home with suspicious intentions, even staining the mansion with the \"Scent of the Witch\" she hates so much. She resents him so much, that she is more than willing to murder him, and refuses to listen to his \"excuses\". The way the series treats her character and relationship with Subaru from there on is, in a word, contradictory. First, Subaru is to be given a reason to fight for this girl who, even given his many repeats, he has known for a matter of weeks. And on Rem's side, she must be given a reason to appear sympathetic despite displaying murderous intent towards someone who, in her timeline, she has known for less than a week. Surely, such a feat would be quite difficult, given the established relationship they share. Suddenly, in an amazing feat of Deus ex machina, Subaru has a flashback to a memory he didn't even know he had, reminding him that Rem and her sister held his hands at his bedside when he was ill. The striking realization of this truly earth-shattering display of human compassion is apparently enough to overwrite the fact that she literally murdered him, so much so that Subaru becomes more than willing to die to save her. And that's just the beginning. In a single episode, Rem is given the opportunity to dump a 10 minute monologue of tragic backstory that, again, apparently redeems her past homicidal actions unconditionally. And then Subaru responds with a canned motivational speech to cheer her up, which somehow shakes Rem so deep down to the very core of her being, that she instantly falls completely and madly in love with him.\\n\\n\r\nEverything in the show up to this point, I could forgive. Rem's backstory was fairly enjoyable, and was certainly the most development a single character gets in this entire series. I can certainly understand that she, who has lived her whole life trusting basically no one but her sister, would be moved by Subaru's kindness, even if that kindness came in the form of a generic support message. I can even entertain the possibility that this could lead to her giving Subaru another chance to make her trust him, and lead to her opening up to and maybe even falling in love with him, given the proper additional development. What I truly cannot comprehend is that I, as the viewer, am expected to believe that this single backstory dump and the speech Subaru makes in response justifies making Rem into a completely different character overnight. So much so, that in the span of perhaps two weeks to a month in-universe, she now has an exhaustive mental list of all of Subaru's best traits, and all the things that made her hate and want to kill him are now \"so cute\". So much so, that, in that span of time, she has prepared an entire itinerary for how she and Subaru could elope and spend the rest of their lives together in idyllic happiness. So much so, that every word she speaks in favor of Subaru directly contradicts how she acted not a month prior.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the worst part is, the show is actively cognizant of this fact. There are instances where Rem, after a marked moment of hesitation, proudly proclaims her ability to discern the truth behind Subaru's words at any given moment, or that she has never once doubted Subaru's intentions despite to the \"Scent of the Witch\" lingering on him due to the revival curse. Both of these are direct contradictions to actions she took in the past, such as literally murdering him without giving him a chance to explain himself. It's so absurdly contradictory that I initially truly believed that she was supposed to be a satirical deconstruction of typical Isekai heroines, unhealthily affectionate towards and dependent on the first man to ever show her genuine kindness. I thought her character had the most potential to be genuinely interesting, and was curious to see how she would be developed. But as the show went on, I realized that it was all just a pipe dream, and that the show clearly did not see anything strange about her character. With how close Rem and Subaru get, and all the tender hugs and nose-nuzzling moments they share as the series goes on, a viewer seeing their new relationship out of context would be hard pressed to think that Rem is anything other than the primary love interest. But oh, how wrong they would be.\\n\\n\r\nSUBARU: This is it. The crux of the review. Everything prior led up to this singular purpose and end goal: to provide the appropriate context to discuss why Subaru is one of, if not the worst anime protagonists I have ever had the misfortune of watching, and for 25 excruciating episodes at that. As Subaru is a difficult character to sum up, I will instead follow his characterization as the show progressed, from beginning to end. But first, some disclaimers. I am fully aware of the concept that Subaru is intended to be a flawed protagonist. I understand that he is supposed to be a \"weak\" character who does not have the typical hidden reserve of power that an Isekai protagonist is expected to have. I understand that he is supposed to be an ordinary guy who is placed under the extreme mental duress of experiencing countless painful deaths. I understand this, but despite all that, he is still a truly awful character.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first arc, Subaru is actually pretty decent. He is rather annoying, loud, cocky, and brash, but if you do accept what the story is telling you, its not that hard to believe. You know that he is operating under the presumption of being a NEET who is finally living the dream, summoned to a fantasy world to save the realm and get the girl. You know that, while weak by fantasy standards, he is actually fairly physically capable and quick thinking as far as normal humans go. As the first arc progresses, he is humbled by his lack of power and accepts it, resolving not to give up despite that. He understands that he put Emilia on a pedestal, but still believes that she is someone worth saving. I actually like the Subaru of the first arc. Everything changes as soon as the mansion arc begins. From the outset, Subaru seems to have completely forgotten all notions of caution and wariness he had just finished picking up. He bursts through the mansion, laughing and often insulting or harassing its occupants. Even after learning of the country's precarious state, and being told outright how suspicious he appears as a traveler of mysterious origins, his behavior does not change. He is unable to grasp why he is being targeted, and instead of confronting the situation directly, continues \"trying harder\" in the hopes that the winds of fortune will somehow blow in his favor. Finally, he calms down, overcomes the trauma and panic, and buckles down to work together with those who suspect him to solve the problem.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I thought the worst was over, and he had finally developed as a character. But again, I was wrong. At the start of the third arc, he once again regresses as a character, so far backwards that he is in an even worse position than the Subaru at the beginning of the show. I suppose the explanation is that he was soaring on the high of victory from arc two, but that is not enough to explain how he once again completely forgot everything he learned and backed himself into a corner. Completely ignoring his promise with Emilia, Rem's advice, and even Julius', a third party's, warnings, he humiliates both Emilia and himself in his misguided quest to act as a heroic knight. This would perhaps be acceptable, had he not supposedly overcome this hubris on two separate occasions in the previous arcs. Even a flawed character has limits. If I really stretched my patience, I would still be able to accept the situation were it clear that Re:Zero is a deconstruction, and Subaru was rightly debased for his wrongdoings. Instead, after the fallout, we get scenes of Emilia regretting being \"too harsh\" on him, and Rem comforting him and telling him he had the right intentions. What follows is four full episodes of Subaru once again proceeding down the wrong path, despite both verbal and physical beatings and chastisings from other characters on multiple occasions. Again, even for a flawed character, there are limits to what is acceptable before it becomes gratuitous. It got so bad, that the only way to make Subaru a sympathetic protagonist again was to introduce a villain that was so comically off-the-rails psychotic and evil that Subaru couldn't be anything but the hero.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow, even up to this point, I was willing to accept Subaru as merely \"a bad character\" the kind of generic throwaway used in many shows, ironically the type Re:Zero supposedly satires. And then I watched everyone's favorite episode. Driven to the breaking point, Subaru asks Rem to run away with him and start a new life together. Rem, though very flattered and tempted, refuses to accept, knowing that Subaru's heart was not in the request. What followed was a long sequence of Subaru berating himself with surprising accuracy, and Rem comforting him with the the aforementioned praise and affection. I thought maybe, finally, Subaru had awoken for the last time, and become the protagonist he was meant to be, the protagonist that should have already existed after arc one. Instead, I got that line. That infamous line that was so egregious, it spawned countless memes: \"I love Emilia.\" This character, this man, had just finished listening to Rem pour out her misguided feelings, after first directly asking her to run away with him, and his first reaction after getting his spirits back up due to said girl was to reject her.\\n\\n\r\nEven then, even after all of this, I still naively thought the worst had passed. Instead, the Subaru of the following episodes acted in the following ways: asking Rem to support him in his quest to win Emilia's heart (she smiles and calls him terrible while he laughs it off); asking Rem for a knife to carve his and Emilia's names on a tree; nuzzling noses with Rem after a rescue; outright telling Crusch that he has a #1 and #2 girl in his heart. By this point, Subaru had transcended my worst imagination, and gone from a simple flawed character, to an absolute scumbag. But the series never acknowledges this as wrong. In the final episodes, everyone, including Rem, treats Subaru as the hero he always wanted to be perceived as. We even get a heartwarming confession scene from Subaru to Emilia that was so similar in tone to the scene with Rem, it was as though the series pretended that the previous confession had simply never occurred. The way Re:Zero condones Subaru's near two-timing behavior and his treatment of Rem actively promotes the idea that it's okay for a guy to perpetuate an emotionally abusive relationship with an emotionally unstable girl who debases herself and accepts that she is his second choice, but still idolizes the guy just because he reached out to her once when she was vulnerable. This was what I found to be the absolute most vile and deplorable aspect of this already flawed show.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, when I think about the time I wasted watching and thinking about this dreadful anime, I wonder if I would like to have the Return by Death ability myself, if only so that I could kill myself and reclaim that lost time and blissful ignorance. But honestly speaking, knowing that a show this offensive and terrible exists serves as a great benchmark, and makes me appreciate the ones that I like even more. 2/10.",

            "content": "At this stage, in 2016, anime series of a high quality, and anime series that are unique and new are rather sparse. A plethora of shows are almost identical, some taking the very foundations that make up particular well-known and well-acclaimed series and attempt to put their own twist on things, in an attempt to deliver something new to satisfy the anime community. Granted, most are unsuccessful, but a select few are able to pull it off brilliantly. In my opinion, Re:Zero is one of these.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe concept and foundations for Re:Zero are most certainly nothing new. Time-travelling, reincarnation/being reborn, and of course a fantasyworld. At a glance the more meticulous of us would realize this is the exact same as countless series we have seen in the past. KonoSuba, Steins;Gate, DanMachi, and an uncountable amount of more series have all focused on one of these aspects to a high standard, so I myself wasn't coming into this anime with high hopes.\\n\\n\r\nBut oh boy was I wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAn average teenager, Natsuki Subaru, is suddenly transported into a fantasy world after a brief visit to the grocery store. Upon arriving in this world, he is attacked by a group of thugs, only to be saved by a mysterious girl by the name of Satella. Things seem to be going well, but unbeknownst to them, something much darker is prowling in the shadows. Soon, both Subaru and Stella are brutally murdered.\\n\\n\r\nNot only did Re:Zero successfully pull off the entire time-travelling aspect, which in itself is very difficult to work with, but it was able to take the generic 'transported into a fantasy world' idea and put their own edge on it, making an upbeat, light-hearted setting into something much deeper and darker. As oppose to focusing on the good stuff, it tends to focus more on the things you would find in the shadows, the darkness. Death, suffering, gore (sometimes unnecessary and over the top) are all common. It focuses largely on the impact of dying countless times on an average person's state of mind, and how it can change them as a character, but we'll get onto that in a second.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the story and pacing here is slightly slow. It focuses on worldbuilding, as every anime that should have several seasons would normally do. A lot of people seem to have dropped after the first few episodes because of this very reason, but that is most certainly a stupid thing to do for Re:Zero.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, it starts of slow. Yes, it seems like nothing new at the very beginning and everything seems very bland and perhaps for some even displeasing to watch, but later on is the turning point. Character development rockets, the story actually begins to head somewhere and it does not hesitate to change characters entirely. It was even more gratifying because of that slow beginning, and I have to admit I was not expecting it and it made it all so much better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Subaru. Natsuki Subaru is your average teen, much like you and I. Weak, unremarkable, it would be like taking any old 17 year old and placing him in a fantasy world. That is what Subaru is essentially like.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Subaru has one power in this world, and that is Return by Death. Upon being killed or dying in any way, shape or form, Subaru is transported back to a specific checkpoint or place he was at previously, with all memories of the incident intact. Naturally, after this occurring several times, we are able to see this take effect on Subaru's mind.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru constantly suffers at the hands of his power, and the ways he die, the memories of the incidents are all rooted deeply in his brain. As previously mentioned, every aspect of Subaru screams average, and such experiences would drive any average person insane, and surely enough that's what happens with Subaru.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact he is average is what makes him relatable, and makes everything seem much more real to me. He isn't some overpowered, Mary Sue/Gary Stu character that is able to effortlessly deal with any problem in his path. Because he is average, we are able to suffer with him. Because he is unremarkable and unnoticeable are we able to feel sympathy for him. Because he is average, we are able to feel much closer to him and feel much more emotional whenever any negative occurrence comes about. Finally, it's because he is average that we are able to put ourselves in his shoes, and follow the story much easier. The way his character develops throughout the course of the story is very apparent and incredibly well done, and every minor change is notable. We are able to see how an average teenager deals with constant death and suffering, and how it evolves him as a whole. This, without a shadow of a doubt, is one of the high points of his character and all characters in this series. Subaru also affects everyone around him. In fact, Subaru is probably one of my favorite characters in recent years. We absolutely hate him, but it feels like we're meant to. After all, he is like us. He's an idiot, we all hate him, his decisions are just illogical and it makes you want to punch him at any given moment because of it. But, the reason I love his character so much is because of what comes about later.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru accepts who he is. He is able to accept his flaws, and who he was as an individual. In fact, he takes his flaws, sets them as his very foundations, and strives to make himself a better person. He changes himself, and the way he talks and views others, and it was all amazing to watch. A character who actually got a lot of development and come to term with who he really is... It's something that is rarely seen nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the main character, we have a large and diverse supporting cast, all with their respectable roles and links to Subaru. Emilia, Rem, Ram, and countless others all make the story as great as it is. But there are a few characters I think deserve to be talked about in detail.\\n\\n\r\nRem. She is by far the most focused on and developed character in the series, on par with Subaru, the MC himself and even more than Emilia. Initially, she seems to be cast to the side, and is just a source of humor. At least, at first.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this changes drastically as the story progresses onward. We learn about her dark past, and we learn more about her as a whole. She develops feelings for Subaru, and becomes incredibly loyal to him, and always stays by his side even in the direst, darkest of times. Rem is undoubtedly one of the reasons that Subaru is as good a character as he is. She is able to drag him out from the brink of insanity and make him strive to be a better person. The characters in this series are all linked/connected to each other in some way, shape or form, and it's pleasing to watch. The chemistry between Rem , Subaru Emilia and some other characters is just a gift and definitely a high point of this series. She quickly becomes 'the' character that comes to mind when thinking of Re:Zero, but even she has her flaws. I feel like her character was made and developed, or actually altered from the initial source material in order to make a sort of love-triangle best girl rivalry in the series. For this, a lot of material on others was cut but I'll get onto this in a second here. She almost seems to be designed to be what many have called her 'waifubait'; to be an ideal 'waifu' to the viewer. I can't say I agree, but I can't really say I disagree with this either. She's a good character, but she also has her flaws.\\n\\n\r\nEmilia. Cute, shy, kind, lovable. These things make a lot of people like her right from the get-go, but what I liked most about Emilia was the fact that she was independent a lot of the time. Usually, the lead girl will stick to the male lead at all costs, and rely on him quite a bit. On the other hand, Emilia can easily live without Subaru and even rejects him and stays away from his several times in the story. Aside from this, there isn't too much to say about her as she only appears much in the first half. However, something really bothers me about the way the anime portrayed Emilia as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nFor whatever reason, they cut out a lot of backstory and important information about Emilia. The result made her seem much more of a bland character, and made her seem like she did not receive any development whatsoever throughout the series. In fact, she did, but it just wasn't as obvious, and one thing that tends to bother me about this is that people overlook the fact that you're meant to connect the dots and figure it out on your own. It isn't directly thrown into your face, you're not really spoon fed all of the information. This series will have several moments like this. You'll need to pause, you'll need to think about what has happened and how this affects the characters as a whole. I can't stress it enough how important it is to do this in order to fully realize the scale of how good and well-developed the majority of the characters are in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also characters like Felt and Reinhard, Rosewall and many others. They rarely ever get any screentime. Reinhard and Felt were both made out to be something big, they seemed like they'll be important to the series as a whole and will partake a major role in deciding how the story goes.\\n\\n\r\nThat assumption could not be more wrong.\\n\\n\r\nQuickly, characters like the three mentions are cast to the side. Just like that. After all the build up with Reinhard being a strong badass swordsman he disappears from the story completely later on. Same with Felt and Rosewall. They get mentioned, but don't actually make an appearance.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.8/10\\n\r\nThe sound for Re:Zero was simply amazing. The openings and endings were the type that would be stuck  in your head for hours after hearing them, and would be easily remembered. They were also unique and had their own style. One thing I actually liked, was that they were sometimes skipped at crucial moments in the story, so that it flowed much easier, instead of being obnoxiously thrust upon you. This lead to me enjoying and savoring them much more. Aside from the openings and endings, the OST's used were also brilliant. Every single one of them was expertly executed, and they were all pleasing to listen to. The voice actors did an absolutely outstanding job with the characters and the singing, in fact i'm still in awe of how good Betelgeuse's voice actor was and how well he was able to depict his insanity. Same goes for Rem and Emilia's seiyuus, they perfectly conveyed their emotions throughout the series and each emotional scene was just THAT much better because of them.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.8/10\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good. The detail that went into a lot of the characters, most notably Emilia, was great. She was beautiful at all times, and the series did a good job with the lighting too, being able to change from a light-hearted and upbeat scene to dark and sinister in the space of a few seconds. One downside to the art in my opinion was the CGI used in the background, which animated the random people on the street and whatnot. I found it quite distracting, and sometimes it drew my attention away from what was actually going on. Another thing was that with Re:Zero, much like a lot of anime, the quality of the art and the fight scenes dropped majorly towards the second half of the series. This is normal however, but aside from these two things I quite enjoyed the art.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI haven't enjoyed a series more than Re:Zero in years. Sure, I haven't watched too much myself, but the blend of dark, psychological trauma and a fantasy setting were brilliantly done and kept me drawn in constantly. At one moment, characters would be chatting happily, and the next something would happen completely out of the blue, followed by a creepy well-done OST that just gave me an \"oh shit\" feeling. I wouldn't even seen the time flying past. Most elements of the story were brilliantly executed, and I was always on the edge of my seat wishing and begging for more!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say it is certainly a 10. It's not anywhere as good as the light novel for several reasons, but I would say it's still 100% worth watching. Hopefully, with further seasons, we'll be able to see this anime progress and become much, much better.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me paraphrase Hitler. \"Any anime that seeks to be popular has to accommodate itself to the comprehension of the least intelligent of those whom it seeks to reach.\"\r\nThat isn't to say that anyone who enjoyed this is stupid. Just to say that this show caters to stupid people. And that is to say that it's some pretty lowest common denominator stuff. And I'm explaining that so that I don't get slapped on the wrist for insulting people.\r\nNow that I've insulted \"the best anime of spring 2016, the year, the decade, and possibly of all time\", I'm going to take some time to state whyI disagree with this statement, before breaking down into a slander based rant where I compare this anime to 3 month old dick cheese.\\n\\n\r\nI'm off to a fantastic start, aren't I?\\n\\n\r\n(spoiler warning.)\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is a show that is often overblown. It is called a psychological masterpiece when Subaru has a mental breakdown, an action masterpiece when they kill a whale. It is said to be a character-driven emotional epic where the main character reacts realistically to what happens around him. And yes, while it does have its moments, it isn't nearly as good as people make it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nI want to start off by addressing that this show is no different from the \"generic overpoewered mc\" trope. Before you lynch me, let me explain. Subaru is often said to be a protagonist who is not overpowered, and has to struggle to achieve his goal since he has no \"trump card\" or superhuman strength that will triple in power to help him defeat his enemies. However, while he isn't subject to a sudden power up, he is constantly subject to ridiculous plot convenience at every corner. The show lasts all of 10 minutes before he meets Satella, a magic user and her familiar Puck, and befriends them both. Our merry band of three then go off on a journey to get back something Satella lost. On their way, they save a little girl (hooray for good deeds) who the turns out to be the daughter of the store owner they met earlier, who apparently knows exactly the information that they need (boo for using said good deed as a cheap plot advancement technique). The point of this ridiculous paragraph is that Subaru didn't have to use his ridiculously big brain or his ultra technique to solve the problem- he just needed to wait for things to fall into his lap. Just like with how it then turns out that Satella is actually Emilia, and she also just happens to be living in a mansion with a rich lord willing to employ Subaru for his services, and also happens to be a candidate for Queen of the kingdom. And as soon as it began, Subaru's struggle to make a place for himself in society via struggling for things he has not earned has ended with his superpower- not Return by Death, but by the superpower of plot convenience.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this isn't an isolated case. This happens throughout the anime, other cases being anytime Beatrice does anything (thank you, helpful loli of plot advancement. We'll need you until we're not in the mansion anymore), Reinhardt showing up in the store to prevent the crazy knife girl from killing Subaru because he \"just so happened to be in the neighborhood\".\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the ridiculous edge factor. The constant over the top bloodsplosions and limbs flying off comically reminded me of Akame ga Kill, a show constantly called \"2edgy4me\" and \"reliant on over the top gore for shock\". However, when it's in Re:Zero, the same thing is praised for being \"horrifying\" and is generally thought of as adding to the show. I am not trying to say that any gore is edgy- but Re:Zero's use of gore definetly is. Gore should be a \"show, don't tell\" aspect of a show. It's the icing on a violence cake. It isn't the cake itself. Re: Zero constantly shoves how gory it is in your face. Each fight is secondary to the blood spilled during it. There is one genuinely disturbing moment in its violence, and that's when Rem gets twisted up like a pretzel. Although that moment is immediately ruined by the fact that recently-made-into-a-pretzel Rem drags herself to Subaru comically thanks to the power of love.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that has a love affair with violence and making its main character watch his friends die, it's super scared of actually having anyone die (and yes, I am aware of the \"it\" that happens in the light novels and think that not including \"it\" in an anime that has no confirmed season 2 as of yet is a good idea). Death of characters loses its meaning when you are looking for the shock factor in the character's death not in the death itself, but how the character will die this time. Death also loses its meaning when it's happening all the time and has no consequences. It doesn't matter if someone dies, because they will be back. Characters here elude the reaper via Subaru returning or straight up ignoring death. Unless you're a side character, in which case fuck you and die a gory death for shock value.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of that. Time to bitch about characters.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru is constantly a happy-go-lucky-devoted-to-his-companions type until they visit the royal city, where he starts letting his ego get out of check, resulting in A Very Bad Time for all involved. Seriously, the way he behaves in the royal court made me physically cringe. Maybe that was the point. Seriously, who acts like that at a royal court where all of the top officials in the land are? It's the equivalent of walking into the UN and doing the same thing. Doesn't matter how much of prick the people may be, you don't act like that at a place that is deciding the equivalent of the fate of the world. Regardless, after making an absolute fool of himself and getting beaten up by Purple hair fujoshi bait while Red hair fujoshi bait looks on all sad-like that his friend is getting beat up, Subaru undergoes a transformation and becomes the new and improved Subaredgy, who likes to believe that without his godly intervention, nothing will go right. Which would've been a really good change, if not for the fact he becomes an insufferable tool out of nowhere, for no reason. It isn't even a result of him having to deal with a whole lot of shit like getting killed by Rem, dying of mana exhaustion, etc. He was fine all that time in the mansion despite what he went through. For him to suddenly develop this new personality because Julius called out on his behavior and the beat him up for trashing the name of the knights of the kingdom (the equivalent of shitting on soldiers) is unreasonable and stupid. This new personality also causes his intelligence to regress, making him attempt to have Princesses who control armies and businesses with great success bend to his will because he simply wants them to rather than thinking of how to navigate the political climate. And this all lasts until Rem gives a great speech to him to cheer him up. And then he's back to his happy-go-lucky self. And despite realising how he can't do anything because he doesn't have the fighting skills or magic skills to help. And he still doesn't attempt to learn them, leaving others to do the work for him. The one time he does attempt to learn it is when he is Subaredgy, and gives up soon after he changes back to regular Subaru.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a constant slew of characters who are introduced and do almost nothing of note despite how much of an impact is seems they will have when they are introduced. Here lies Felt, Priscilla, Anastasia, Aldebaran, Beatrice, Russel Fellow, Elsa, Roswaal, and Old Man Rom (and to a certain extent, Ram).\\n\\n\r\nBut by far the worst character has to be Betelgeuse. Rapey weirdos who lick people weren't okay in Sword Art Online, and they shouldn't be okay here. Betelgeuse is a jarring addition to the cast, constantly talking about his brain trembling and pulling weird poses and munching his fingers and talking about how slothful people and having a crush on the Jealous Witch and not much else. Props to the VA though. He was fantastic. Made Betelgeuse actually bearable.\\n\r\nBetelgeuse is constantly built up to be the ultimate bad guy of the series, someone who is seriously bad news. and in the 4 episodes they actually go out of their way to fight him, he is constantly killed ridiculously easily. It took double the amount of episodes for Subaru to be able to leave Roswaal's mansion alive (which brings me to another gripe, it took 12 episodes to introduce the first major plot point, which is the Queen candidate story. 12 episodes. half the series. What.).\\n\\n\r\nRem and Emilia are the least grating of the lot, but that's because they're the waifu bait. They need to be likeable. problem is, Emilia disappears right after episode 13 and only reappears in episode 23. 10 episodes of the main love interest disappearing leads to what happened- people start supporting Rem as the main love interest rather than Emilia, which is sad, because Subaru and Emilia had a bunch of really good moments, which all evaporated in the wake of a 10 episode disappearance.\\n\r\nRem has the problem of literally trying to murder Subaru in episode 6. How can a show where what happens has a \"psychological effect on the main character\" brush this off the very next episode because \"she held my hand when I was having a nightmare\"? It just doesn't make sense.\\n\\n\r\nTruthfully, Re:Zero is a bad show. Not truly bad, but also definitely not amazing or deserving of being called the \"best\". And it sure as shit would've been a better show if not for the constant outpouring of praise from those who watched it.\\n\\n\r\nNot the best of its season. That's Boku no Hero Academia. Not the best of its year- that could be Konosuba, Boku no Hero Academia, ReLife, or Shokugeki S2. Definitely not the best of the decade, when you share the decade with shows like Katanagatari, Bakuman, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, Steins;Gate, Anohana, Nichijou, Usagi Drop, and Fate/zero. And that's just 2010/2011.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is show that got popular for a good reason. One that I'll never understand.",

            "content": "To preface, I also own the other adaptions (manga, and the source Light Novels), I have to say this is a really faithful adaption of the light novels, though they do skip out on a lot of detail and shift some things around, for a 25 episode series it does fantastic with what they were given, and the time restraints (heck, they even doubled the size of the first ep to get all the important introductory details and often times skip the OP/ED, or mesh the ed in with what's going on at the time, and one episode not only did all of that butwas also extended by a couple minutes) so all that said, they tried their damndest to fit in all the important details to the first 3 arcs of plot.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has the best characterization I've seen in any medium thus far, it's incredibly easy to connect and relate to the characters and the actions they take, the story is incredible and heartbreaking, as the main character struggles with losing everything, over and over again... As you probably know from the summary of the anime, when MC dies he returns to a checkpoint, where he's the only one who remembers what happened before, as described by him a \"Time Leap\" reminiscent of Steins;Gate(ironically enough, the art of this anime is by the same company who does Steins;Gate as well). \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story goes, this is probably the best way I've seen this genre done... You don't feel like it's the same story every single time it repeats, the smallest effects change the entire coming events (the butterfly effect) so no two loops feel similar at all, and the story stays fresh and compelling, and there's so much detail packed in that you can rewatch a ton. The story itself is fairly dark and gory, not quite what you'd expect from the genre but it does it so magnificently.\\n\\n\r\nThe adaptation itself is on point, there are some important details removed (but to be fair, the super important ones that were removed only pertain to the future arcs, and I mean, about 3 arcs past where the story ended here, where this season covered arcs 1-3) some things are moved to a different point in the story, covered by a different person but it could've probably still canonically been done that way in the novel as well. Overall I'm very impressed with how they adapted the story, you can see the love and care in the episodes and how packed with details they are, yet the flow of the episodes are still like you'd expect. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound in my opinion are fantastic, the artwork for everything from the characters, to the magic, the fighting and the gore are all wonderfully done, along with the sounds, from character voices to sound effects are all fantastic... And then you have the amazing soundtrack/music score, from the op, ed, to the music that plays during the scenes, it's on par with Steins;Gate, in my opinion, with those two having the best music score of any anime.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall impression of this anime is quite easily one of the best, if not the best I've seen, it compelled me into buying all of the light novels and manga (including future pre-orders) soon after buying and completing this series... and the source novels are even better than the anime(which isn't too surprising, given they usually are, and explain things in more detail, tying up loose ends of things that didn't make sense in the anime and so forth), this is the one anime I have to say is an absolute must see (unless you can't handle gore/dark settings,) further more it also has my favorite episode of any anime whatsoever in it, but I won't be spoiling that at all since the build up to it is in my opinion absolutely flawless.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nRe:Zero rocked the anime world in 2016 and was named the new king of the Isekai genre. Re:Zero took the crown from Overlord Season 1, which had usurped Log Horizon, which had overthrown Sword Art Online in the famous coup d'\u00e9tat led by Digibro. The scramble for supremacy continues in anime's shittiest genre. Yes, I hate Isekai even more than I hate harem anime. However, I'm not just writing this review to rehash my opinion that anime would be better off if .Hack had been The Last Isekai back in 2002. \r\nPlot:\r\nRe:Zero is about a gamer geek named Subaru who closes his eyes and wakesup in another world. This is of course a fantasy world that operates similar to JRPGS. Subaru is rather thrilled by this and immediately tests to see if he has any powers. It turns out he has the awesome power to reverse time by a few hours or days. However, this power only triggers when he dies. While Subaru is effectively immortal, this means he has to go through a LOT of suffering to get a happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nThis plot, combined with the jarring tone shifts between goofy comedy and brutal violence, means that comparisions to Higurashi are inevitable. I was told by one of my offline friends that if I loved Higurashi, I would of course love Re:Zero. Well...I wanted to love Re:Zero. However, I find it comes up very short against Higurashi. Allow me to compare and contrast for a moment.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers if you haven't seen Higurashi.)\\n\\n\r\nRika and Subaru both have essentially the same ability. However, there are some key differences. Subaru just needs to survive one major event and then he gets a new \"Savepoint\". His first task is to not get killed by 3 thugs in an alley and not get killed that night by an assassin. If he lives to the next day, he never has to relive the first day. Rika needs to save an entire village from an evil organization. If she dies, there are no checkpoints and she has to relive the same 3-5 months! Subaru gets to remember how he died and all details about his last life. Rika isn't allowed to remember who killed her or key information from previous timelines. She has to solve it all in 1 perfect go. Subaru immediatly stumbles into super OP allies to help him survive. Rika's only allies are a buch of punk kids with no powers or special abilities. Subaru at most has to retry 3-5 times to reach the next checkpoint. Rika spent over 100 years suffering to achieve her victory. When Rika FINALLY pulls off the upset and defeats Takano and her forces, it's one of the greatest feel good moments in anime. When Subaru wins in Re:Zero...meh.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest in the fact I don't like the studio White Fox. I find their CGI very intrusive and shoddy. The character art is...fine. It's not a hideous looking anime by any means, but nothing blew me away either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI didn't actually hate Re:Zero, but I did find it very disappointing. Perhaps I went into it with my hopes WAY too high. It was probably just a victim of overhype, but I can't say I enjoyed this one very much. I also didn't feel it went anywhere that other anime haven't explored far better. Re:Zero is just pure average, white bread. It's fine, but completely unremarkable in every aspect.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am usually not one to write reviews, but I feel like I have to on this one to help save someone else their time that can never be taken back.\r\nI got sucked into this anime b/c I made the mistake of trusting the hype train on this one. After watching it, I have no idea why this anime was so hyped. \r\nThe story starts off with an interesting premise in the first couple episodes, and then quickly evolves into a shell of what its potential could have been. There are only 2 characters that undergo any type of real character development, and it isshallow at best. Not to mention this guy is thrusted into another world, keeps dying and going back, and b/c of this, it seems like he's known characters for months, but really it has only been a few weeks tops, and already he has formed deep bounds with many of the characters, including the love and admiration of some. I kept watching it hoping the plot would really get going somewhere, but it never did. You are left asking more questions by the end of the anime than when you started, and not in the good way. The whole world he seems to have been transported to is extremely shallow the whole way through the and hardly ANYTHING is ever explained.\\n\\n\r\nLook, this story and world building and character building in this anime was honestly so terribly bad I could go on for a long time on it, but I'm sorry I'm just not one of those people that can write a college paper on an anime that frustrated me to this extent, especially when I'm pretty sure no one will ever read this. I'm not someone who normally rates anime's I have watched extremely low either. Typically b/c usually when an anime is just so bad I can't bear it I will give it up after around 3 episodes usually. The thing that was simply SO frustrating about this anime though, was that it had the formula. It had the setup to really turn into something special, instead, it never delivered. Imagine you wanted a nice car. You see a present in the driveway that looks like a car under the wrappings, and then you tear it open and its a little hotwheels car. The disappointment I feel in this anime can not be overstated.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise there are a few episodes and scenes that are well done, but as the anime goes on the quality VERY NOTICEABLY DROPS. Really after the first 3 episodes it becomes apparent, but there are some scenes where it gets good again, specifically some ending scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Designs. There were honestly so many loli characters it was disgusting. Is this really what anime is becoming? Where the animators really think having 4/5th of the female cast being loli are a good thing? Apparently they are trying to appeal either 10-13 year olds or grown up perverts.\\n\\n\r\nPlease don't watch this. Or if you want to watch it, give it a chance, but if at any point you're thinking: \"just one more episode and I know something is going to happen that is going to make this anime really good all the sudden\"...just stop it there. It never happens.",

            "content": "Rezero is easily the most popular anime of Spring 2016, it\u2019s your typical isekai anime but it comes with a twist, that twist being that it has a time travelling aspect. Yup, an anime that\u2019s involving time travelling, nothing could possibly go wrong riiiiight?\r\nSo what makes this show so popular? Well, the story follows a guy named Subaru who got randomly teleported into another world, why does he get teleported into another world? Who knows, its magic. Funnily enough he acts as if teleporting into another world is a completely normal thing to happen, he didn\u2019t give a single shit on why he got teleportedinto another world and instead tries to be this genre savvy character where he acts pretty self-aware of what\u2019s going on. From there we meet our 1st waifu bait, Emillia. Without any knowledge of what\u2019s going on, Subaru decided to help Emillia, and by doing that we finally encountered this show\u2019s twist, that twist being that Subaru has the ability to go back in time every single time he died, basically, he\u2019s invisible, This is probably the worst thing you can give to a character.\\n\\n\r\nBy giving a character an ability to basically redo everything till he gets it right basically kills any potential suspense that this show could of have since Subaru actions literally have no consequences because he can just redo everything and try to do things right. And I know what some of you are thinking right now \u201cBb-but Farrel! If you keep dying constantly it will result a psychological damage thus making you depressed and that\u2019s what makes Subaru so \u201cRealistic\u201d. Pft yeah right, the psychological strain is just melodrama that gets out of its way with the power of friendship (Or with the power of a Lap pillow LOL). His mood swings are so quick that it is hardly believable, forget about realistic. He has a breakdown, then it's resolved within an episode or two. Constantly doing that makes the consequences feel tame and do not have impact because they constantly has not well executed breakdowns then resolves them with just as bad execution. \\n\\n\r\nI think that the people who considered Subaru as a \u201cRealistic character\u201d is referring to the fact that Subaru is a completely useless character and that makes at least 90% of the people who watch rezero easier to self-insert themselves because it\u2019s relatable to them.\\n\\n\r\nOkay enough with Subaru, let\u2019s move on to the more crucial problem that this anime had, that being the storyline. Rezero\u2019s setting is entirely reliant on the supernatural power, that being the teleportation. What was it that triggered Subaru's transportation? Why Subaru of all people? Of course it didn\u2019t get explained, are you really expecting a show where the author does whatever he asspulls every 5 minutes to give us a logical explanation? Lol, keep dreaming.\\n\\n\r\n>inb4 someone tries to justify it by saying \u201cIt\u2019s all explained in the Novel!! xDD\u201d\\n\r\nSorry, but saying that \u201cIt\u2019s explained in the novel\u201d Is not a valid argument. You should understand that we\u2019re not talking about the novel here. The light novel and the anime are two completely different entities as they should be. A novel is not to an anime what a guide or a manual is to a videogame, so please dont try to justify how shit this anime is by saying that all explained in the source material.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem that this show suffers is they rely on shock factor to make this show more \u201cInteresting\u201d. If we take a look at the early episodes, it took Subaru MORE THAN 2 TIMES to figure out that he has the ability to travel back in time. It\u2019s quite ironic how they show Subaru as this genre savvy character in the 1st episode, where he\u2019s pretty self-aware that he\u2019s being teleported into another world, but it took him that much time to realize that he\u2019s stuck in a loop.\\n\\n\r\n Of course they are doing this just to show us that this show is edgy, they torture Subaru so that the people have the impression that this show is dark when it is not. I\u2019m sorry but adding torture to your main character every episode in a whole arc with no actual story progression or content does not equal a good subversion. And they didn\u2019t stop there, they have to torture Subaru again in the later episode where one of the maids has a suspicion on Subaru, and then guess what Rem did? That\u2019s right, She kills him. If one is suspicious, wouldn\u2019t any individual go ahead and try and reinforce those suspicions with facts and an ounce of sense, things which they have garnered throughout an investigation? Of course that\u2019s not what rem did, but instead, she kills him. Oh wow, what a dark show we have here everyone. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t do anything more than killing or torturing characters, it will get boring very fast because the audience will get over the initial shock, and eventually get used to it. Plus, we know that Subaru is not going to literally die anyway, so why do we even care at this point?\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that\u2019s quite ironic about this show is that the author said that he wants to critique the whole isekai genre, but he doesn\u2019t do that at all. Infact he did the complete opposite, he basically did everything that he wants to \u201cCritique\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, rezero is nothing different from any other generic light novel adaptations out there, it tries to be something different, but fails miserably. The show is relying entirely on the plot convenience and cheap ass shock factor to get the story in motion . All the characters can be summed up in a word; they're cliche and the story hasn't utilised anything or even the time reset aspect, it's more a way for the story to get to point a to point b faster than anything. The setting is dry bland and bleak as ever. I won\u2019t recommend this show to anyone unless you\u2019re one of those people that are easily impressed by some cheap ass shock factor and a premise that\u2019s too reliant on constant plot twists in order to keep the viewer seated.",

As the first main heroine introduced hereafter, named Emilia, Subaru quickly decides to devote himself to this beautiful girl. Emilia saves him from the attackers and Subaru states an alibi of helping her finding the one who stole her gem to keep attached with her\u2014since he wants to know more about the city and has nowhere to go. His decision to follow\u2014so he will have someone beside to travel and gather information, \u2014is the beginning of his bloody journey and the truth behind his existence there, as well as his discovered-newborn ability related to dark magic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY ASPECT\\n\r\n    The first half of this story was fucking boring. I really fed up with few episodes when Subaru comes back to his starting point because of his death moments. His ability is \"Returns by Death\" will activate immediately if he dies. He is unable to tell others about this ability whatsoever, thus, everytime he comes back to life he thinks about the plan to prevent his death and others he loves in Lugunica from death later. This series is way time too much to reveal the protagonist\u2019s logic behind all of it. Too much soliloquy with slow development of Subaru's lame thoughts (fucking sick of it already after 3 episodes). It's starting to change after the deuteragonist, or at least that's how I assume the character named Rem there, enters Subaru's life. Rem is taking this series to a whole new point with an increasing amount of conversation with other supporting yet fundamental characters too. She is the reason why I decided to finish the series when I was already in half way and ready to drop this.\\n\\n\r\n     Rem's role is more than just deuteragonist here, more than that into the story. She grows up Subaru's thought and idea of his hopeless self. She spreads love and emotion to us with her love. What a pure love she has. However, even if Subaru as main protagonist experiences revolution of himself to better man than before, he is still the \"irritating\" one who made me wanna puke. He is weak for God's sake. Not just it, but his pose is irritating and already overdo, made it not funny anymore for me. He is good-for-nothing but boasts himself. He can act like a real hero and childish unpredictably with ease that made him like a character who doesn't have fix personality. His pride and his mumbling in the end only arises just for creating tension and sympathy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\n    The character development is only up for Subaru himself. It's clear that only Subaru who can make a change and new possibility for others because of his ability. He makes use of his ability to prevent or make progress for things when other characters just follow the decision he makes later with their own characteristic. Other characters help Subaru in their own role, but the most that we can feel is all about Rem (I discovered myself in a hesitation about who's the real main heroine here (Rem everywhere)). His thoughts and idea are getting better as the time goes. It is, however, impossible to change if there are no other characters support him (as I say, he is such irritating and pessimistic).\\n\r\n    The other characters are all mannequins-like, They are there and suddenly just bunch of corpses by being replaced with other characters in stage. Only Emilia and Rem get their development a bit following Subaru. Subaru\u2019s ill thoughts are created to make himself looks developed afterwards. From such ill thoughts to be something greater, a real man.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVISUALIZATION\\n\r\n    Any expectation for its visualization will not be let down. Surely fantasy anime needs nice graphic for satisfying our eyes. Re:zero does nice colouring, when your emotions gonna stir up by the tension it gets hazy and when hope arises after the dark age of ill thoughts it becomes luminous. They combine the colouring well with situation. Beautiful scenes got my sight, but nothing really matters, except the character design which is impress me much. Green surrounding but not too detail, and epic battles although there aren't much battles I could find here. The facial expression of characters is the best aspect of visualization here. It's really represented the feeling of anger, sadness, hopelessness, desire, wrath, worry, sincerity, innocence, and relief. So many clear facial expressions that make this series can be so emotional for sensitive person. I guess, everything near the facial area is the focus of this series, aside from facial expressions, there are also hair, hair accessories, and near shoulder area.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\n    The OP is sung by Konomi Suzuki \"Redo\", it's pop-rock like with many synthesizer effect, try to be a beat pieces but fail to satisfy my ears. The OP2 \"Paradisus-Paradoxum\" by MYTH & ROID is more Re:ZERO for the series. It's suitable to be Re:ZERO theme song with its beat and spread shadowy vibes with the instruments. The ED \"STYX HELIX\" by MYTH & ROID is another success for the music aspect in this series. I think MYTH & ROID is always slaying this series. This ED has more back vocals like whispering or murmur-like and slower tempo that fit for the ending. The \u200bED2 \"Stay Alive\" is sung by Rie Takahashi (Emilia's seiyuu). It's the best for me! With ripped-apart-heart beat supported by the instruments (especially crashing drums) and seiyuu's vocal character as the singer, it's amazingly stunning. Plus the fact of the scenes that play in the back.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY:\\n\r\nMy own rate for this anime is 8. I can't forgive how dumbass and fucking boring it at first. Rem saves the series in a really good timing and after that it starts to be better than expected.\\n\r\nPros & Cons:\\n\r\nThe first-half of the series is fucking dumbass, I was getting bored and wondering. The second-half of the series was something priceless to watch for tho\u2019. But, I should be honest here, I disappointed with the ending, it feels like they tried to pack it in hanging way.\\n\r\nIn brief, it has no ecchi scenes (well, such female exaggerating parts of female and kind of flirting way does exist but it's considering as less).\\n\r\nThe music aspect is so great, ED2 surely.\\n\r\nRem is deeply, surely, definitely, falling in love with the protagonist. Her sincere love to him drives her to be a diamond that saves this series in my list. Rem is up for the pros here.\\n\r\nEmilia and Rem can tug at my heartstrings. Emilia is my favorite.",

            "content": "I write this review, extremely late to the party, only to express my feelings about this show. I need to put into words my thoughts in the series, as it continuously lives in my consciousness. I find that rating  it objectlively is a huge obstacle. I'm far too attached and anyway, nothing is analyzed without at least a tiny bit of biased. I'll try anyway.\r\nThe story really is great, but falls short of perfect. As our main character Subaru is thrown into the middle of this new world, it seems that despite how much he struggles, it is almost to easy for him tonavigate the world by the third day he arrives. There is a criticism that states that the show relies too heavily on shock value (i.e a lot of death), and while I would argue that the entertainment to the viewer comes from the trauma and emotions the characters experience from this rather than shock to the viewer, I can see why it would annoy people. Ultimately, there are some bland spots where the show loses a bit of drive and focus. And that's all the criticisms I have on the story. Its engaging, its emotional, it's pretty action packed, its dark, and it's simply an excitement to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to package the art and sound together because both of those aspects are breathtaking. There is like one or two spots where the cgi isn't good and the rest of the time it's great. The music is played in a slight distracting way in a couple of scenes. That's it. The rest is flawless. The art, character design, and visual aesthetic of the show are an amazing fit. The design is so good that some otaku in a track suit is iconic. That's how good it is. The music perfectly matches the art and tone. The first op is great and the second is my favorite op of all time. Not to say the other aspects of this show are less that great, but the art and sound are simply so amazing that it honestly becomes objectively the best parts of Re:Zero.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are show's weak point, if you can call it that. There are motivations that feel forced or simply boring, and it is so with one of the main characters. While I really enjoy Subaru, there are times where I simply can't watch him make a trash decision and he becomes frustrating. The best character is treated like trash and i hate it but the only reason I dislike it so much is how attached the I got to the characters beforehand. There's not just likeable characters, but nearly all of them were fun.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show so much. 10/10 fun. I can't justify it I just love it.\\n\\n\r\nObjectively the show is a 9/10 or even and strong 8. Personally it is 10/10 best show. It has a great story, mind blowing art and sound, the characters are entertaining and I simply love the series.\\n\\n",

            "content": "SPOILERS!!! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK\r\nSo Re:Zero was let's say an interesting anime where the MC or Subaru has to relive events over and over in another world.\r\nThe story was really interesting because we get to see a person get randomly teleported and I mean randomly to a different world and has to survive dangerous situations by dying over and over, but the twist is that he remembers everything that happened while everyone else forgets so he basically has to replay events until he resolves everything. The story goes through many arcs, but it's pacing is done very well and it was interesting finding outmore about the world Subaru is trapped in and the many different situations that were happening.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters were really unused I mean a lot of characters that are in the anime like Felt, Reinhard, Ram hell even the main girl Emilia aren't really used a lot. Honestly the only characters I gave a damn about were Subaru and Rem who really should've been the Main girl since Emilia was bland as hell, Subaru was a nice change for a male MC since he exploits a lot of the usual anime cliches and turns them into jokes which was actually refreshing to see and his personality really changes a lot throughout the anime. There was some romance, but people will pretty much get triggered from its result. Overall there were some good characters my main problem is that they weren't used very effectively.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the action sequences and these battles can be huge and chaotic which made the show even more entertaining, there is also a gore aspect too since some of the deaths are pretty gruesome, but very detailed. I also liked the artstyle it reminded me of Akame Ga Kill in some ways, but since White Fox made both it isn't really a surprise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think Re:Zero is a good anime, but could definitely improve some aspects because there are even some parts of the story that aren't even explained so if you like fantasy animes with psychological, drama and some action then this is a decent enough watch for you",

            "content": "I really liked this anime. It has my favorite kind of setting, swords (I am a simple person), magic, plenty of realistic depictions despite the unrealistic nature of the show, and a bit of romance to add to the action. \r\nBefore watching Re:Zero, I had a very poor opinion of it. I thought it looked like a generic thrown into another world story, with a stupid main character, and a maid waifu generated solely for fanservice. I had never intended to watch it, as it was getting a lot of attention and looked really lame. One day I was browsing youtube and saw \"Re:Zero in8 Minutes\" from Gigguk. It was pretty funny, and after watching a few more of his videos, I thought to myself \"This actually looks like it could be pretty decent.\". 3 days later....\\n\\n\r\nThe selling point of the show, to me, was the fantasy setting. I love fantasy settings, because magic, swords, fighting, knights, dragons, all the good stuff. I don't known why I hadn't picked up the show when I first saw it was in a fantasy world; that's my stuff right there. Re:Zero did the classic fantasy setting really well, while adding a bit of it's own lore and uniqueness (albeit seldom explored).\\n\\n\r\nOne big thing that the show seems to get critiqued (positively or negatively) for is all the pain Subaru goes through. Some view it as a pointless gimmick for \"thrill factor\" and a grab at audiences outside of it's target audience. As for myself, I am of the opinion that all the violence, emotional and physical pain are essential to the anime. Despite being like a video game, where Subaru can die and go back to a \"save point\", Subaru still very much fears death. Once he dies, he does all he can to stop himself and others from dying so that nobody has to feel pain. The torture he goes through develops Subaru, and as a result, the story. Gore isn't necessarily an attention grabber, it CAN be used well.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, Re:Zero is pretty wanting. The 2 characters that receive the most attention and development are Subaru and Rem. To keep it short, Subaru lives a carefree life for the first half of the anime, developing his eccentric charisma, while the second half of the anime allows him to fix his mistakes and improve himself. As for Rem, she is a quiet maid who seems pretty robotic and generic at first, but eventually opens herself up to development after certain events. These events lead her to become a VERY important character, impacting many of Subaru's decisions and ultimately aiding Subaru in his quest to save Emilia. As for the other characters, Ram is a side character that receives a buildup alongside Rem, but is not present for the most important parts of the story. Emilia receives some characterization, but is also unfortunate enough to be Subaru's primary love interest, which leads her to becoming an ideal waifu, which means that she is pinned up as a very static character and subject to fantasizing, which is one of the themes of Re:Zero.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it's very tied in with the themes presented. It begins as a simple fantasy story with one nasty twist, but eventually the \"main story quest\" is subdued for much grayer elements such as themes and characters. This is an amazing aspect of the anime. It explores multiple themes throughout, at first very subtly, but slowly it presents some fairly interesting ideas. There are a few \"central\" themes, the most noticeable being \"learn from your mistakes\". The entire series is an anime equivalent of Dark Souls, where the protagonist must persist fighting and dying until they find a solution or are lucky enough to somehow make it past a trial. Another theme, which I mentioned before, is expectations vs. reality (fantasizing). Subaru has very set expectations of what will happen and why things happen, but is surprised repeatedly and corrected throughout the story. The main focus of this theme is his relationship with Emilia. He spends a great amount of time believing that everything he does is best for Emilia, and that she understands. Midway, he is shocked to find that Emilia can't understand him at all, and finds that she, in a way, falls short of his grand expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very well done, some specific scenes (oddly, the ones showcasing Rem or the Master Swordswoman). Throughout the series it was consistent and reflected the mood. It was surprisingly colorful for the amount of heavy themes presented, which ended up working out really well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fantastic. The creepy (and redundant) sound made when Subaru realizes something is wrong is very well made, and the sound effects were perfect. The openings and endings were very good, and helped fabricate the mood even better. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I highly enjoyed Re:Zero. A fantasy centered anime with a surprising amount of violence for how bright it was really shocked my prior expectations of the show. The characters could have been focused more, and the story was definitely cut short (many references to completely untouched topics and events were made), so I'd love to see another season. I admit that I am pretty disappointed that the author of the series had Subaru fall for Emilia so hard, as Rem was superior in every way, but there were many things that would have been missed out on had it not been that way (and foolish people like me can still hope that Rem has a chance, she was a great character and I'd love to see her more). The setting alone makes it worth watching, and who knows, maybe you'll like Emilia more than Rem (though I hope not just because of popular opinion) and enjoy it in different ways than I did.",

            "content": "Honestly? I don't see why this anime is popular. (In fact, I disliked some of the elements so much that I came here to do something I said I wouldn't: become a big enough weeb to write a serious, deconstructed review for a fuckin' anime.) \r\nI've dropped the show after 14 episodes.\r\n(reposting bc it got accidentally deleted! glad to see a lot of other top reviews share my opinion haha)\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story's decent, at least in the beginning. Time travel, fantasy lands, slapstick humor: nothing unusual, and all elements that've proven popular in other animes, but here, it seems to be a poorly executed jumble.From the surface, it looks cool- a regular joe dimension-jumps and finds himself in a world where, like in a videogame, he can die to return to the last checkpoint- but any deeper probing reveals what is, in my opinion, a goddamn boring shamble. It's disorganized in places, and plain dull in parts. There are some redeeming strokes, which are nice, but not, in my opinion, enough to pull up this anime into the 'must watch' region. (I might be biased against harem animes (and this one definitely has elements of a harem anime). I think they're dumb. Sorry.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nNice art. I liked it. Nothing particularly special, but not off-putting, with good proportions and colors, and nice landscapes and worldbuilding. Probably one of the biggest redeeming points of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nSame as the art- good music choices for the themes, well-fitting. Not distracting. Definitely helped set the mood for some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nThis is, in my opinion, where Re:Zero starts to go down the shithole.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are boring as shit. The main character makes use of some slapstick humor tropes, like being comic relief and the hero at the same time- all it makes me think is that he's stupid as hell. Additionally, he becomes bizarrely obsessed with the main heroine over a very short amount of time, and this... devotion... becomes more and more drastic over the episodes, up to the point where he's directly disobeying her express wishes to do what he thinks is best- for her. (This was the biggest reason I dropped it. I fuckin' dislike the protag.) Finally, in a holy trinity of shit, he switches character types alarmingly often, from the charmingly obtuse but cheery character to the murderously entitled one to scared-to-the-point-of-shitting-his-pants. (I felt like he was a real gary sue, as happens a lot with harem animes. Dull as shit, but all the chicks end up falling in love with him anyways.)\\n\\n\r\nWhew. Got that off my chest.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters- honestly, none of them really stood out. There are the basic character tropes- maid twins, tsunderes, the nice guy (though i have to say, out of all of them, Reinhard was probably my favorite), lolishotas, the perfectly bland girl, the eccentric master- and I found myself wondering when this episode was going to finally be over so I could see if the next one was any less boring. (Hint: It wasn't.)\\n\\n\r\nConsensus: 3/10\\n\r\nI don't drop a lot of animes. Even moderately boring ones. Hell, I watched all 26 episodes of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, and in terms of a ridiculous main character, that was even worse than this. Mostly, the thing that got me about Re:Zero was how goddamn annoying Subaru- the main- got after 5-6 episodes. Watch if you like good animation and music and interesting fight scenes, or are a fan of the trope fantasy genre, but if you're looking for genuinely dynamic, realistic character development- keep moving, nothing to see here.",

            "content": "Re:Zero is the currently airing anime that many people are watching right now. It begins with an otaku, Subaru Natsuki,  who is transported to another world where whenever he dies, he comes back to life again from an earlier point in time, being able to correct his mistakes. \r\nMany people seem to enjoy this show, but I feel this show isn't really that great. Although it is not finished yet, I have read some spoilers about what will happen next and I believe around the 15 episode mark is a good place to make a judgment upon a series. Even though I am inthe minority about this not being a great show, I still want to offer my opinion on the show in case it helps anyone out. \\n\\n\r\n[Disclaimer: There are spoilers about the series below. Read at your own discretion.]\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI feel like this anime, so far, really has no end goal in mind. It really is just Subaru trying to find a way to survive. With a lack of focus on any sort of plot, I have no idea what kind of ending this series is supposed to have. If we go each arc at a time, I find that first arc is pretty decent. While it has its flaws, I can still find some enjoyment in it. In this arc, Subaru is introduced  Emilia and has to find her pin that she lost. Using his past experiences as a guide, he is able retrieve it. This arc serves as a decent introductory arc to what the series can be, but it is lost potential from there. The second arc is totally useless and provides almost nothing to the main story. The only bit of story is from the first episode of the arc. Other than that, it totally deviates from the main story and can easily be skipped without missing out on anything. The characters introduced here are forgettable and so bland, you don\u2019t even need their introductions to know them well enough, but I\u2019ll go into more deeper in the character section. With the second arc, we can begin to see the Subaru break down as a character, as he becomes more obsessed and broken. I was forcing myself to watch this second arc, but the lack of focus this has on anything made it a major chore on me. The third arc started okay, but delved deeper into meaningless and boring territory, with what I think, no way out. We learn about the priestess selection ceremony and how Emilia is part of it. But as we go further into the arc, it delves away from this and instead goes into another meaningless arc with Subaru\u2019s action being really cringe-worthy and eventually is just Subaru wanting to return to Emilia\u2019s mansion, with no focus on the storytelling anywhere else to help deepen the plot and world. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters beside Subaru in Re:Zero are bland and have very little personality. They are not interesting and have generic backstories. I do not feel attached to any of the characters at all because we, as viewers, aren't given any reason to do so. For example, the maids Ram and Rem are introduced and we learn they are demons. Their backstory is not compelling and is essentially the writer trying to force emotions onto us when it is working due to the genericness and the way it is presented to the viewers. As for their personalities, they don\u2019t really any. They are just maids and do maid tasks to varying degrees of success. There is nothing interest about that at all. Theses characters are truly forgettable. As for the main protagonist of Sabaru, although he does have some semblance of personality, the way he acts and behaves makes me exasperated at him and the show. Firstly, he does not even question how or why is transported into this world. Instead, he acts like it is completely normal and is surprisingly chill about it. He does not even contemplate about his past life and the things he has lost, like his family and friends. Over the course of the series, Subaru begins to acts more irrationally and puts emotion over logic, which greatly affects him both physically and mentally. Although experiencing death is taxing to an extent; the way Subaru lets his emotions control time and time again leads him to make stupid decisions which ultimately leads to a preventable death and therefore less stress off him. Subaru\u2019s main motivation to is for a girl he met, Emilia. Over the course of the show, Subaru obsesses over her constantly, without being given an actual reason to, besides the fact he finds her hot. His actions are a main reason that this show really is off-putting, since a rational person would not act like he does. Character death is supposed to be used to draw emotions from the viewer; but instead, Re:zero uses it as a plot convenience instead of its intended purpose. This is because Subaru can alway die to prevent his own and other\u2019s deaths. And although an element was added in a recent episode that worked around this flaw, I find it to be stupid due to it seeming to be going nowhere. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime to come in 2016, the animation is fair. It isn't great, but it isn't bad either. The animation is fluid and the colors are nice to look. Overall, it's pretty decent. The character designs seem really generic and I don't really feel any uniqueness from them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNone of the tracks are memorable, but they aren't bad. They are just there. The opening nor the ending really stands to me. The voice actors are pretty good and they portray the characters well while delivering enough emotion where it isn't too much or little. Overall, the sound is just mediocre, there is nothing special to it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI really forced myself to watch this show because of the large amount of people saying it was worth my time. While watching, I was forcing myself to try and find the good parts of the show, but they were few. The characters, plot and world were all bland and boring. I did not enjoy how the story did not expand to anything more than Subaru doing a small task, while the bland and tasteless side characters made this show more of a chore. The animation and sound did not help my enjoyment of the show at all. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, RE:Zero could have been much better, if it decided to flesh out many elements and put more effort into building an actual story. With this and better characters, this show would have a lot better and I would have enjoyed even more. Unfortunately, this show fails in these aspects and does not live up to the hype it has built for me personally. This is why I am giving RE:Zero a score of 3.4/10. \\n",

So yes, he's basically immortal. \r\nI love this anime for various reasons, but first I want to talk about the characters. I love Subaru, the main character, he's a funny guy who seems not to be afraid of death due to his power. My favorite character has to be Rem, yes, the biggest waifu of Spring 2016. I love her because first of all, she's adorable, and she starts as a sidecharacter that later plays a huge role in the series. Rem is best girl, okay.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't get me wrong, I love all characters in this show, but of course, there are some terrible character. The main villain, Betelguese, is just pure evil, he has the perfect villain role, he caused so many shit to the characters, especially Subaru. Back to Subaru, he has been through so much shit, you all don't know how much shit he went through just to save everyone. Another character I hate is Princilla, she's the stereotype hot bitch that everyone hates. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a great series for people who want to get into anime.

            "content": "Re: Zero is a very unique anime. It has done what few others can do: It is well done in both concept and execution.\r\nThis anime also manages to build meaningful character relationships. The chemistry between Rem and Subaru especially is quite noteworthy. However, this is not the only way Re: Zero succeeds in making worthwhile character interactions. You can also see this done very well in small talk.\r\nAlthough Re: Zero has these things going for it quite strongly it is a bittersweet strength to have. The reason for this is because the anime does not give an outcome in which the characters its put togetherare where they should be(this is quite vague cuz spoilers n' stuff ;P)\\n\\n\r\nThe only other real criticisms that can be given to Re:Zero are its main character and ending. Subaru is a static character. This is problematic do to when the anime is trying to give you a \"shonen protagonist\" feel for Subaru, but its painfully obvious that he is no such thing. Subaru mostly gets helped through the whole story, which is not a bad thing except that the writers are forcing the whole shonen protagonist thing.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the ending to Re: Zero just sucked. My reasons are this: (1) Subaru was still in love with you know who... (2) The ending left a lot of unanswered questions, which is really important in a show that's interest somewhat comes from its world-building. (3) The ending was rushed far too quickly; The epic build-up to the finale was completely ruined by the lack of time. It was cheesy without any proper time to make the series' last problem seem important.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately. Re: Zero is a wonderful anime that has some extreme strengths, and some abhorrent weaknesses. It does what it does so well, but the problems keep it from becoming the masterpiece that it should have been.\\n\\n\r\nSolutions Re:Zero's problems: Season 2; A second season would greatly help the story to this anime, and just make it all feel more sensible, it needs to give the Subaru's love interest much MORE TIME, or put him with the rightful best girl, and most of all it needs to answer questions surrounding the universe of Re:Zero.",

Overall I like it, but to break it up, I like the first third, hate the 2nd third, like the last third.\r\nThis is a unique take on the stranger in a strange land genre and worth a watch for anyone who enjoys that type of show.  You may want to give up on it when you get to the middle, but if you push through, it will return to the enjoyable style of the first third.\r\nOne thing that did bother me was the change in personality and strengthof the main heroine though.  Unlike many shows, this anime has good development of secondary characters, not just development either, but nuance.\\n\\n\r\nAt times the show will get a videogame feel and that is intentional, but you forget it.  When you look back on the show, you may recognize a larger videogame theme to everything, but I'm not sure it's a game I would want to play.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're hoping for something similar to Log Horizon or Sword Art Online, you will be disappointed.  You need to go into this without thinking about other shows; I have difficulty thinking of anything to compare it with.  If you can't handle serious emotional things in a show, don't watch this.  People who like horror animes might find more enjoyment in this.  Given the way the show ends, I am not sure that I want a second season.",

        {
            "content": "When you hear the premise for the series it sounds very much like the plot of Edge of Tomorrow (or more relevantly All You Need Is Kill): a boy gets sucked into a fantasy world from Tokyo and discovers that he has the ability to restart at a set moment every time he dies. Once you hear that it seems obvious the tricks that the series will play and the drama that will unfold, less because it is common in Anime than because we are all accustomed to thinking that way when playing games. Indeed, the main character Subaru does actually act just like he'sa cocky video game protagonist for the longest time. But what makes this series so clever/different/frustrating (pick two) is just how minor that premise really is. They go to great lengths to avoid using redos to accomplish goals, even to the point where it seems like it would make sense. It's sidelined to the point where many of his deaths happen, not at the climax of the episode, but in the beginning or the middle. Because they're not the main point.\\n\\n\r\nI actually really liked this for the most part. Firstly, when your lead cannot die there's a tendency to have it seem like there are no consequences and thus no threat. Every film I can think of which deals with the idea has the character confront this problem at some point. But by not hiding from the pain and fear of death, each time he dies it seems like a shocking, horrible experience that he naturally wouldn't want to suffer again. This means that he tries to preserve each and every life, with only a slight recklessness and calmness about lethal scenarios separating him from an ordinary character. This makes the plot seem far less repetitive than other lethal reincarnation stories. He doesn't systematically approach each scenario planning around his deaths to gain knowledge or advantage. Each time he tries something completely different until one approach works, or something that he learned in a past life becomes of key significance.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing about the way his loops make him look utterly useless. This wasn't an angle I'd ever considered before, but when you get everything right on your first try (as far as everyone knows) and nobody sees all the ways you could have failed they're going to assume you're just lucky or that the situation was never that serious; otherwise you'd have had to try harder. That must be just incredibly frustrating. That he's the most important member of any team isn't particularly obvious to people since he lacks any useful skill. Most stories of this sort (well, all really) have their lead learn new skills using their infinite opportunities to gain experience. Since he's so reluctant to die (and seems generally to act like he's the PC at the center of an RPG), Subaru never learns much of anything about how to fight. People have to do it all for him. That's a great change for the protagonist, and it leads to the series coming up with many new and different ways to have him prove his usefulness and remain proactive despite being, generally, pretty useless.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, that perception of uselessness wouldn't be possible if he just told somebody about his ability. Storywise, this would open a whole new kettle of fish and place him in quite a different role. But the series has a clever way of handling this that not only provides a logical limit to his behavior but builds on the wider story. Somehow his ability is connected to the evil witch who's responsible for most of the bad things that happen in the show. Whenever he tries to tell anyone about his \"return by death\" he feels her hand crushing his heart and has to stop before he dies. It's a great idea. It prevents him from ever explaining why he's useful while also making his whole situation and behavior slightly ominous (what does she want him for?) and even manages to advance the plot since the closer the witch's connection to him is, the more attractive he smells to any monsters in the vicinity. Thus, he makes an excellent bait.\\n\\n\r\nThis inability to discuss his powers also enhances rather dramatically one of the typical features of such a story: the trauma of watching those you care about die over and over again. People keep sacrificing themselves to save Subaru, and he can't tell them to stop as explaining would kill him (or in one case them). Watching people throw their lives away to protect somebody who's basically immortal is so frustrating that it'd drive anyone a little mad.\\n\\n\r\nThe other aspects of the show are good as well. The animation is first rate. Everything really looks fine and detailed. Character designs are generally great, even if none of them really stand out. The characters themselves are a bit of a mixed bag. Subaru is notably full of good and bad components. He's convinced thoroughly of his own importance and strives to fill the hero role that he believes is his by virtue of being a PC. The fact that he generally is the most important character there but can't tell anyone is a good source of drama. But his self-importance does make him very annoying at times, and the payoff comes late and takes far too long to explain. Really, you get the idea from just the last couple of sentences don't you? but it takes an entire episode for them to explain it. It also makes him peculiarly motivationless at times, which is a problem from a dramatic standpoint. Still, it's deeper than most Anime characters go, and his flaws are at least acknowledged in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are, as I said, mixed. The chief love interest Emilia is Typical Anime Princess #5. Very generic and non proactive. Some of the details about her are interesting, but she's not really much of a character. The twin demon sisters Rem and Ram are better constructed, although it takes a while for them to get beyond kawaii maids. And these are the main characters for the first half of the series. Fortunately, the second half expands on this character base and brings us Emilia's rivals for the throne. And each of these characters is interesting and has a well-developed personality and goals. They each have a knight protecting them, and again they are distinct and entertaining. The villains are rather less impressive. While the witch herself is built up very effectively through hints and innuendos, the main villains are an assassin called Elsa, whose main character traits are that she enjoys gutting people and licks her licks sultrily a lot, and Betelgeuse, a mad high priest of sloth who's basically a gross clown who moves like a marionette and constantly bites the tips of his fingers off and bleeds from his eyelids. He's gross, completely mad, and not very entertaining or threatening. Better are the generic mad cultists, who wear cool KKKish black robes and can sink through solid objects.\\n\\n\r\nThe series peters out without resolving much of anything unfortunately, but I understand that another season's in the works so that's completely understandable. They do at least resolve a few character issues and finish their small scale quest. The world feels big and so many elements are introduced that there feels like a whole world of story to expand on. I'm looking forwards to the next season of this series and hope they can expand on some of the elements that really worked here.",

If you dont do that then its still pretty good until next season , if it gets one. -7/10\r\nArt: Whitefox Bruh. What more can i say -10/10\r\nSound: Whitefox again m8 -10/10\r\nCharacter: Suburus kind of a prick at times and i disliked him at the beginning but as theshow goes on like every other anime he gits gud and i liked him towards the ends. But he should have chosen REM. -6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: i liked that shit. not much else i can say other than its a fun and thrilling show that only elitist would turn away. -9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: overall this kush is pretty dank. tis not the finest i've ever smoked but i would definitely smoke it again for a good time.

            "content": "At first glance, Re:zero seemed like one of those typical fantasy-moe-harem show, but don't let the promotional poster fool you.\r\nUnder the cute character designs and colourful backgrounds, lies a very dark undertone. \r\nA guy surrounded by many girls; we've seen that countless times. \r\nBut a guy surrounded by (cute) girls and death and killing and dying over and over? Now that's new, even if it utilised the now-typical'summoned to another dimension' thingy.\r\n(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)\r\nSubaru the MC gets summoned to a fantasy world, meets the heroine, fell in love with her, vows to protect her and everybody he holds dear. It seems quite ordinary, but hefound out that the most effective way for him to protect them is by dying and restarting the events. It's just like an RPG game. Subaru's 'Return by Death' even has its save points! \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is excellent, it's neither too rushed nor too slow, and although at times the story could be confusing, everything would make sense later. However, this show ended with many unsolved questions, like 'who's the witch?','why Subaru?'and many more. That's the only thing I'm salty about.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is truly exceptional; the colour tones used suits the mood and situations really well. In the first episode for example, the flashback(?) scene where Subaru vows to save Emilia,it was very dark and gloomy, and the special effects helps to add the feeling of desperation, fear and regret faced by Subaru. When the atmosphere is happy and relaxed, the colours used are the typical bright-cheerful-fantasy pallette, and it's one of the reasons why the show is truly deceptive.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are also given a lot of details and were simply gorgeous, like the streets in the Capital, the overview of the capital,the sunset when Subaru and Emilia were in the slums, furnitures (LoL)...I could go on and on. Fighting scenes are extremely fluid and enjoyable to watch, and the transition of scenes is also smooth. The CG used did not feel out of place as it was used tastefully, in the right places. I'd give the art a perfect 10.\\n\\n\r\nThere were many interesting characters in this show.Take Subaru for example. He's the most developed character so far, from innocent and naive to basically being an insane,selfish jerk, and then to the courageous young man. His change from a good guy to a...selfish prick is quite understandable though. He's been through so much suffering yet he couldn't tell anyone about what he had faced.It's a wonder that he managed to stay sane before Rem's pep talk.\\n\\n\r\nIn the sounds department, the voice actors did an excellent job, especially Subaru's and that Sloth Archbishop's VA. Subaru's VA had to make angry, dying, crying sounds and of course it's no easy feat. Sloth's VA is the same as Kirito (SAO)'s, and it really amuses me how different he sounded from Kirito. The sound effects used are so on point and gives the appropriate feels. The OPs and EDs are also catchy and unique.  \\n\\n\r\nSo...I'll recommend this show to those who loves time-travel, fantasy and psychological genres. There's a bit of romance, but it's not really the main focus of this show. I hope season two comes out soon. \\n",

            "content": "Re:Zero is not what it might look like: \r\nin spite of the large array of waifu on display, it isn't really a Harem anime; \r\nin spite of Subaru looking very much like a typical Light Novel protagonist, gratuitous magic, and fantasy setting, it isn't really a SAO clone;\r\nand, in spite of having a plot built around time travel, it isn't really a typical 'time travel' story.\r\nRe:Zero is, if anything, a partial deconstruction of all of these, and a character study of its central character Subaru.\r\nThe fact that Subaru is such an excellent character is the show's single greatest strength; his generic appearance belies quite agreat deal of emotional and psychological depth, and each arc serves to throw him into a different sort of emotional turmoil.  A lot of what kept me watching from episode to episode was seeing how his approach would change, and what changes this would cause.  Because of this, if I had to pick a genre for Re:Zero, it would be a Mystery; the central thrust of the narrative is uncovering what is pivotal to Subaru's survival, and what isn't.\\n\r\nThe show has a good assortment of supporting characters; though only Emilia and Rem get anything approaching the attention of Subaru, the bulk of them nevertheless have enough personality that they come across as more than two-dimensional, especially as each episode reveals a bit more about them.  My personal favorites are Betelgeuse Romani-Contee, one of the most delightfully insane characters I've seen in some time, and Ricardo, because I am a shameless furfag.\\n\\n\r\nThis season of the show doesn't have one central arc; rather, the story follows a series of shorter events that are visited and revisited with a slightly different perspective.  Each arc is essentially begun via the repercussions of what had to be done to escape from the certain death of the previous arc, with the stakes getting higher every time.  As this season is primarily a character study, the primary questions of the series are barely addressed at all; however, enough information is present to make conjecture satisfactory - at least until it all gets answered later on.  Considering the show's popularity and the number of things still not answered a second season seems quite likely.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show does have some action, the quality of its combat scenes only rarely ever raises above 'passable,' due to a somewhat lackluster quality of animation.  Characters are well-designed and never off-model (though the CG on background characters in some scenes can be a bit too conspicuous), but the animation itself is frequently somewhat choppy, and the choreography frequently comes across as just a little awkward.  The show only really pulls the stops out in terms of the animation at a few key points, though the results are memorable when it happens.  The soundtrack is serviceable but not particularly noteworthy, outside of one particularly effective stinger (which the show gets quite a lot of use out of).\\n\\n\r\nIt's not quite a masterpiece, but Re:Zero is definitely worth at least checking out; if the first three episodes are enough to hook you, the remaining 22 will not disappoint.",

I expected something more thrilling as in the beginning of the episodes, as to continue in the end. \r\nWhat I liked was the music, how it was composed in the anime, the director and his staff have done a great job in the soundtrack.\r\nWhat I didn't like was very much information going on and I didn't get it overall the intention of what they wanted to achieve, was to clean the name of Emilia or to kill Betelgeuse? Also the witch didn't show her face and why was intoSubaru's body. What was that thing for the white whale, that was so important to Subaru goals? \\n\r\nAnyway one thing I liked was how strong was Subaru in copping with difficulties and also when he lost it all when things didn't go how he want it to. I really liked that part because it approximates how things go in real life that life it gets so hard and doesn't go how we want to, that's why.  To show how he matures and becomes a fine and strong man in the end. \\n\r\nSo to conclude the anime was good and very good (7.5) and I didn't enjoyed it very much.",

            "content": "Spoilers. \r\nWhat Is RE:Zero about? It's about a boy who tries to save a girl in a fantasy setting. That's about it ( see credits EP 25).End of story. Newcomers will enjoy anticipating the 3-4 episode long arcs with half of the show consisting of dialogue. Whereas people used to anime will be impressed on how it uses art,story, characters, sound, or fight scenes differently compared to other anime like Sword Art Online or Berserk. \r\nStory: The whole series is a battle Shonen with a 8 episode fighting climax. \r\n Except this time, the kid's unique power is the ability to respawn after dying. Andlike many Shonens  (DBZ or Naruto) it takes 3-4 episodes to power up and move the story. It is pretty interesting. \\n\\n\r\n For instance, transition episode and dialogue about Emilia being the next queen (EP 13-14). Subaru finds a death cult, knows something bad is going to happen, and dies (EP 15).  He goes to ask for help and runs into the right people at right time  ( EP 16)Actual event happens, transition to next problem -Whales (EP 17).  Repeat this for defeating an assassin (EP 1-4) , defeating a curse, ( EP 5-11), defeating the whales  (19-22),  witch cult (23-25). \\n\\n\r\nIf this type of long storytelling is your thing, be my guest. Watch Re: Zero and  have a drinking game. Every time Sabaru cries, every Subaru mentions Emilia, every time REM comforts Sabaru, every time someone dies, take a drink. If not, the dialogue sounds like a broken record and it is boring. Negotiation after negotiation gets pretty tiring. \\n\\n\r\n Characters: Whales, witch cult, curses, wolves, or assassins are cool enemies to create suspense. What is better is that the heroes ( Sabaru, maids, Princess, random nation leaders) have small convictions. For instance, Subaru has a white knight conviction to save Emilia. Why does he love her? No reason. She helps him once in episode 1 and that gives Subaru the license to put her in a pedestal for 24 episodes. The villains are textbook two dimensional characters. Whales are bad (EP 17-21). Why? Cause they ate my wife ( EP 19). The show had 25 episodes to explain this fantasy world, but the writers chose dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nArt: With a lack of convincing characters and Shonen story, you would expect a fantasy show to have really good art or pull images from famous MMOs like World of Warcraft or Dragonquest. Nope. That is what makes Re:Zero different.The main characters don't wear armor. They wear pretty normal clothes : trench coats, dresses, track suit. It's different for any anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Since it is a fantasy world, you would expect theme songs for the different races, for different characters, and identifiable battle score. Again, it subverts the cliche and the soundtrack is nothing but ambiance. Also, the show gives the unique soundtrack of Subaru screaming like a girl. He sounds like a howling monkey or gargling mouth wash and it gets annoying fast. The witches cult, character ,Betelguese,  sounds like a comical One Piece Villian. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you really wanted to see how a NEET would react in a  fantasy world, this is  the best anime.  He feels like a NEET. They mention NEET in the beginning and at episode 18 and that's about it. The show does not get repetitive after episode 8. With outstanding art, characters, story, sound, for a fantasy show, this is probably the best anime I have ever seen and deserves a full 10 out of 10. \\n",

I feel like this will eventually become like the new SAO where there is just such a divide in the community in terms of its quality. \r\nRe:Zero stumbles early on but manages to prop itself back up in the middle but then falls apart worse then ever before. The characters are annoying, bland given useless backstories and most of them are just introduced to feel up the screen and i can compare Subaru and Emilia's Romance to Anakin and Padme's from the Star wars prequel trilogy, where Subaru wouldconstantly go back for Emilia and i could never think of a reason why or but Subaru could think of 2000 apparently (kill me). The action for what its worth does look good but im a story and character guy mostly so if it has great action every now and then but im not invested it just looks like money wasted. Also the fact that they havent even hinted at why Subaru is in the world just pisses me of cause i feel like there should be a reason and whenever something interesting starts to happen or is hinted at the show completely ignores it (Subaru being pride but just being like nah). The villains are extremely weak, not threatening and not given as much screen time as they should have been so they can properly develop so when the characters are scared over the edge lord Betelguese you dont understand why cause he is kind of funny. Also due to semi cliched nature of the last third of the show you can just predict the final outcome. \\n\\n\r\nSound was fine but nothing to memorable for me not gonna waste time on it.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the show when Subaru died i wish he stayed dead and the show would end, but i was not so lucky. This review is all over the place and not very formal but this is just me letting my unfiltered, not spell checked and formatted opinions out there. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like Re:Zero thats fine, i know im in the minority but to me personally it represents what is wrong with not only the anime medium, fans and culture but basic story telling across all forms of entertainment",

            "content": "Re:Zero is not one of those generic animes that almost anyone with a little bit of taste in the fantasy genre can enjoy, regardless of the things that keep bothering him such as excessive fan service or frustrating plot inconsistencies. No. Re:Zero is much, much worse than that. It\u2019s a show that is aware of its own flaws but is surprisingly okay with them. It even points out several clich\u00e9s and generic characters as they were mere facts. Re:Zero admits that it\u2019s overwhelming and boring to use those elements again, and again, but uses them anyway and tries to hide them with violence and melodrama.\r\nTheshow starts as a joke of almost every fantasy anime using the main character as the perfect parody tool, making him say satirical things like: \u201cThis must be the event where I cast my spell. Ha!\u201d, \u201cWhere\u2019s my protagonist status?\u201d and \u201cWhere\u2019s the cute girl who summoned me?\u201d but then the story quickly settles down and becomes a serious matter. It\u2019s like the writer wanted to tell us: \u201cWe get it. We know that you\u2019re tired of this overused fantasy world, but we\u2019re going to use it anyway\u201d. We laugh because we know that they\u2019re right, even though we feel like we\u2019re giving them the permission to use it. After starting on a parodic tone, Re:Zero slowly becomes darker and darker throughout the episodes, using horror and drama as its main genres. It gives us this unusual feeling that it\u2019s original and appealing unlike its siblings, by ending almost each episode with a dramatic cliffhanger (sudden death of a character for example). And the problem is, it takes advantage of it EVERY episode to shock the viewer by making the main character look miserable and pathetic to the point that it becomes repetitive and melodramatic. The writer has one rule: each episode MUST end with a cliffhanger whether it makes sense or not. Re:Zero hides under a carpet of clich\u00e9s and uses drama as an excuse to get away with it. Many people don\u2019t have a problem with this. They actually find it awesome and thrilling. But I don\u2019t. I find it exaggerated and unnecessary. What we need is a real explanation of the story, but sadly there is none: the story is divided into small or long arcs so there is no \u201cstory line\u201d. What we demand is a motive, a goal that our main character has to achieve, a reason why certain characters act the way they do, a character development or a background story and NOT a sudden character transformation into the \u201cGood Guy\u201d, nor a romance that\u2019s going nowhere. Unfortunately, we get nothing. Nothing at all. There is no attractive story and the characters are badly written. The whole show is painful to watch and makes you want to break your screen.\\n\\n\r\nPlease note that some sections in this review contain some spoilers. Feel free to skip those sections indicated by a *.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the bad elements:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022STORY: It seems that nowadays, new animes are basically copy-pasting what\u2019s popular (be it an idea, a set of characters, a setting\u2026) and keep twisting it around until it becomes better. One of the major problems in Re:Zero is that it can\u2019t decide what it wants to be so instead it becomes everything at the same time: parody, horror, mystery, slice of life, comedy, action\u2026 And you can\u2019t just pile up all those elements and expect a good and comprehensible story. What is Re:Zero trying to be? That\u2019s the question that I\u2019ve been asking myself (and still is) the whole time. Because to me, the anime fails in every aspect: there is nothing mysterious that you have to find out. Instead, some elements are brought up once and then completely forgotten later (characters, plot elements\u2026). The slice of life (the mansion arc) is unnecessary and repetitive: it doesn\u2019t develop the relationship between the characters. It insults it because the time-travel resets everything. The comedy is also removable as it doesn\u2019t relieve the tension, because there is no suspense to begin with. It\u2019s a time-travel fantasy where the main character never dies and keeps respawning back in time to try again and again until he manages to save everyone. It\u2019s like playing an arcade game where you have an unlimited amount of credits. You\u2019ll win the game eventually. \\n\\n\r\n1) DRAMA: The drama fails due to a simple plot device that keeps the show going: time-travel. Many writers don\u2019t take this sensitive element seriously in their Si-Fi\u2019s and fantasies, and use it whenever and however they want to. But the real advantage in using time-travel in a fantasy is allowing the writer to tell the story in a different kind of narrative: use of different characters and scenarios, seeing the story in another character\u2019s point of view\u2026 Time-travel can easily lead to a suspenseful and interesting story if used correctly. However, if it is triggered when the person holding the ability dies, it becomes a little bit more difficult to handle. The main character\u2019s emotional state becomes crumbled with fears and traumas after each death, whereas from now on, each character who will die besides him will have absolutely no effect on us because we already know that anyone can come back from the dead by time-travel. So the point of this \u201cRewind by Death\u201d is not to shock the viewer, but rather the character. And the sad part is that everyone thinks it\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s not. You\u2019re feeling sorry for the main character, and not the person who has just died in front of him. And why should you sympathize with a useless main character who doesn\u2019t do a single thing during the whole show? Nevertheless, the drama is forced due to the vicious cycle of death-rewind. It lost its value when the writer made this poor choice of allowing the MC to reset the day when he dies. So stop trying to force it, it\u2019s not working. \\n\\n\r\n2) CLICH\u00c9S: I already mentioned this at the beginning, but Re:Zero is still full of clich\u00e9s no matter how much you want to deny it. Think of it: knights, castles, elves, witches, \u201clizard people\u201d, \u201cground dragons\u201d, actual dragons, apples that look exactly like ones but are called \u201cappas\u201d (talk about originality), lolis, maids\u2026 The problem is that the show is aware of all of those lame and overused elements. For example, the MC refers the small and cute characters as \u201clolis\u201d and barely use their actual name. So in the end, we can\u2019t really say that the fantasy world in Re:Zero is original because the setting and characters are nothing we haven\u2019t seen already. And changing the name of a known fruit is not going to help, sorry. Re:Zero is based on a whole bunch of clich\u00e9s, and made this very clear to us. This seems ironic given that it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 and is trying so hard not to be. \\n\\n\r\n3) CLIFFHANGERS: The cliffhangers are poor. Some of them are too predictable, others are too unexpected and impossible to believe. Cliffhangers must make a little bit of sense and more importantly be relevant to the story but instead, they are used left and right for shock purposes. It\u2019s not shocking if it\u2019s not convincing, and it\u2019s not convincing if it\u2019s not provided with any proof. Even the MC doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on anymore, so how can we? One or two cliffhangers are fine, but if you\u2019re going to end each episode with one because you want more drama to your story then it\u2019s not going to work. The viewer will eventually get bored after playing the long and famous game: \u201cWho\u2019s going to die next?\u201d And the answer is too obvious: Subaru, and maybe another character that we don\u2019t care about.\\n\\n\r\n*MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD*\\n\\n\r\nAn example of a typical cliffhanger is the episode where we learn that one of the maids Rem killed the MC. Get this: a loyal maid trying to kill the totally-not-suspicious guest who tried to save her master more than once. This was way out-of-character. She didn\u2019t even talk about her suspicions with anyone, and didn\u2019t even provide any evidence. The only thing suspicious about Subaru was his witch scent, but everybody knew that and nobody really cared to bring that up again. \\n\\n\r\nHow about the episode where our MC commits suicide, but then becomes too scared to die again and let the \"plot conveniences\" (some random monster you don\u2019t know yet) take care of that? Why raise more questions when you can simply avoid them by letting him commit suicide again? And we're talking about a desperate and hopeless guy who wants to save EVERY SINGLE character he meets, even villains who tried to kill him once. And that\u2019s definitely not going to work if he\u2019s going to wait for something or someone to kill him so he can reset everything. He\u2019s wasting his time, and ours.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also an episode where Rem is brutally killed in front of Subaru because the killer wanted him to feel guilty and bad. That\u2019s the reason why there are so many deaths in this show: to traumatize the main character, and not us. Because killing a character in this show is unbelievable and pathetic. It\u2019s like faking death: we already know that whoever dies is not really dead and will come back by Rewind.\\n\\n\r\n*END OF SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nThe endings are executed in a way to keep the suspense and thrill but in the end it\u2019s just for a cheap shock value to keep you hanging and wanting more.\\n\\n\r\n4) PLOT CONVENIENCES: The story doesn\u2019t look appealing nor smart at all. Why? The plot conveniences are everywhere, not to mention too easy to spot. This makes the characters look manipulated instead of independent.\\n\\n\r\nThe first issue is that all the deaths are forced and used against the MC in order to traumatize him. \\n\\n\r\n*MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD*\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 14, Subaru arrives at the mansion only to find everyone dead. He then blindly walks into a suspicious ice room and suddenly freezes to death by some curse just after hearing someone whispering to him: \u201cYou\u2019re too late\u201d. That\u2019s right: Subaru waits to be killed by the unknown because letting him commit suicide will be nuisance to the writer, since Subaru will take advantage of it every time and use it whenever something bad happens. Instead, the writer let him witness everything because he wants to traumatize him even more, kills him using someone/something we don\u2019t know about, and later on tries to justify it. That\u2019s not smart. That\u2019s running away from a logical path that the character could have taken.\\n\\n\r\nAn episode later, Subaru gets his head chopped off by the same monster. His death is not only absurd, but confusing. After we learn the monster\u2019s identity, we then come to the conclusion that killing Subaru in this way doesn\u2019t feel right. It was not his fault. It never was. The monster could have prevented all of this, but didn\u2019t because Subaru HAD to die. It\u2019s almost as if he let him die on purpose. And the writer tries to justify his poor excuse of making this monster kill Subaru even if it doesn\u2019t look compatible with the monster\u2019s personality. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is a very annoying plot armor: the inability to inform anyone about the Rewind ability, either by killing the person holding the ability or by killing the person listening about it. Subaru needs to suffer ALONE before transforming into a completely different person. If he ever tries to alert someone, he starts hallucinating and seeing a witch\u2019s hand coming from the dark grabbing his heart. Let\u2019s say for the sake of argument that this is part of the witch\u2019s curse. Couldn\u2019t he IMPLY that he has been there before or that this was a Deja-vu? Repeating a character\u2019s line for example, predicting his actions and movements\u2026 Is it that hard? (like the MC in \u201cAll You Need is Kill\u201d or its movie adaption \u201cEdge of Tomorrow\u201d). But of course that\u2019s too much for Subaru. He can barely lift a sword, literally. What about the other characters? Are they like Subaru incompetent and indifferent? Just by observing a person\u2019s behavior, you can tell that there is something wrong with him, or that he may have experienced this before. We get to see one of the characters who barely shows on-screen saying that there\u2019s something off about Subaru\u2019s eyes, and that he looks like he experienced many deaths and traumas, but keeps it to himself. It seems that no one really cares about Subaru or pay any attention to him, and I guess it\u2019s normal given his personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe writer needs something that can emphasize the drama. Every episode, from 1 till 18, someone HAD to die or something bad HAD to happen so Subaru can feel guilty, because that\u2019s all on him. He\u2019s the only one who can prevent this using his ability but nobody can help him because they\u2019re not allowed to. So this is really a cheap plot armor that is barely justified by the writer. It is used to traumatize the MC, and it takes way too long that the trauma eventually becomes impossible to erase or overcome. So how, in just one single episode, did Subaru magically overcome his trauma that began since the very first episode and turned into a completely different person? But we\u2019ll get to that later.\\n\\n\r\nAfter episode 18, the drama fades away, because it did what it had to do: make the MC suffer alone using a simple tool: time-travel, while preventing him from telling anyone about it, since it would hurt the show so badly it would end in 12 episodes instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is also riddled with plot holes. The writer doesn\u2019t explain why Subaru is suddenly transported to another world and then cursed by a Witch who doesn\u2019t show up in the end. He doesn\u2019t explain how the \u201csave point\u201d works. One of the most obvious examples is the episode 23 where Subaru respawns back to the strategy meeting after the White Whale battle and says: \u201cWow. My save point was updated!\u201d, which is the same as him implicitly saying \u201cThanks writer, even though I have no idea what happened!\u201d.\\n\\n\r\n5) FILLERS: The story doesn\u2019t have a sense of continuity because it\u2019s divided into small and unrelated stories. Some of them are short and acceptable, others are fillers to lengthen the drama and waste our time. I\u2019m going to explain the real reason behind those removable parts of the show, so I\u2019m most likely going to give examples.\\n\\n\r\n*OBVIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD*\\n\\n\r\nThe Mansion and the Village Arc (Episode 4 to 12): This whole arc has one purpose based on an absurd claim: to strengthen the relationship between Subaru and Rem after she killed him several times because she thought he was a threat to the whole mansion. This is why it\u2019s absurd: she\u2019s JUST a maid so it\u2019s not up to her to decide who lives and who dies. The fact that she\u2019s even trying to kill a guy that has done nothing more than being nice to everyone and helping them because he\u2019s in debt is beyond ridiculous. Subaru tries to convince her that he\u2019s innocent but she doesn\u2019t even listen to him. Beatrice act as his witness and tries to justify his innocence but fails. He blames himself for that and tries to figure things out because his life is at stake here, and not because he cares about Rem. So this arc is just another way for him to escape death by building a fake relationship between a maid so he can earn her trust. The writer makes Rem act irrational and out-of-character by accusing an innocent guy with no evidence whatsoever so he can give this arc a meaning. So if this isn\u2019t filler, what is?\\n\\n\r\nThe Royal Selections (Episode 13): This episode has one goal: to get Subaru into a fight with Emilia. How? By making him look as ridiculous and pathetic as possible in front of everyone. The episode looks like a joke because not one single character in it takes the situation seriously. Subaru keeps screaming and shouting at anyone who insults Emilia. One of the council of elders is caring enough to ask him who he is and if he is done with his painful speech already instead of throwing him out instantly. Felt (one of the eligible candidates) also makes a scene screaming at Reinhard and asking him what she is doing here (I mean, isn\u2019t it obvious?) but later on claims that she will kill everyone in this town if she ever becomes the queen, because to her that\u2019s what a perfect ruler should do. Priscilla claims that she will become a tyrant and make everyone kneel before her, while Anastasia informs us that she\u2019s too greedy and wants her own nation. Old Man Rom literally pops out from the ground to save the day and Emilia finally kicks Subaru out of the room after getting embarrassed in front of everyone. In other words, the introduction of the candidates which was supposed to be the whole point of the episode happened too fast and eventually turned out to be another cringe moment for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe White Whale Arc (Episodes 19 to 21): the main objective of this arc is to make Subaru look smart and helpful, showing us a contrast between his old personality. This arc is no more than just a fight against a giant floating whale that takes up to 40 minutes when it could have ended instantly. Yes, the fight looks serious and cool, but what does it have to do with the story? Isn\u2019t Subaru\u2019s current objective to save Emilia, and not to waste his time running around a monster while teasing it? Wilhelm thanks him even before the fight because defeating this monster is avenging his dead wife, so it\u2019s kind of a big deal for him. In other words, the writer makes the arc look serious and necessary to everyone so we don\u2019t complain about it, and here I am trying to figure out the whole point of it. I think Subaru\u2019s priority is to defeat the guys who killed Emilia in the first place (The Witch worshipers), and not a random monster who killed him once. \\n\\n\r\n*END OF OBVIOUS SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\n\u2022CHARACTERS: If you thought the story was bad, just wait and see what\u2019s even worse. \\n\r\nThe characters are too plain. They have up to 2 noticeable characteristics and once they do their job, they are thrown away into the garbage and completely erased from the show. Moreover, most of their lines and dialogues sound cheesy and messed up. Here are some examples:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDo I look clever to you?\u201d \\n\\n\r\n\u201cYou are still Emilia\u2019s dog\u201d \\n\\n\r\n\u201cExplain this to Emilia and the loli\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThat was a vague order, but alright\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThank you for being defeated\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\"Only I'm allowed to sniff Subaru\"\\n\\n\r\n\u201cLove love love love love love love love love love love\u2026\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThat was perfectly well-coordinated. Did you guys practice that for this meeting?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\"Will you be quiet? I'm trying to make myself look good.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a joke. Those are actual lines from the show that are applied to serious situations like fights, meetings, convincing a certain character about something, giving an order. In general, the characters are well-presented (art, animations, voice) but look dumb when they talk so it\u2019s impossible for you to take them seriously. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t even care about their situation as much as we do. They talk because they NEED to, whether what they say makes any difference or not. They don\u2019t have a mind of their own. They are just following the writer\u2019s orders without thinking like a reasonable human being.\\n\\n\r\n1) MAIN CHARACTER: To put it simply, Subaru is an 18-years old that acts as if he\u2019s 12. He has a special ability that lets him rewind time by his own death but he barely takes advantage of it and doesn\u2019t really explore its limitations. He thinks of it as a joke and doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s truly capable of. In the first episode, it took him 5 seconds to realize that he\u2019s been transported into a fantasy world: \u201cIt's safe to assume that this is a fantasy world\u201d (Episode 1, minute 3), but when he dies the first time and resets the day, it took him almost 2 episodes to understand that he can time-travel by death (did I mention that he\u2019s a NEET who plays video games and watches movies all day?). And what\u2019s worse is that when he goes back in time, he takes the same routes and doesn\u2019t try out new ones. He goes to the same alley where he got mugged last time and screams to the thieves: \u201cYou again?\u201d. This is a time-travel fantasy, shouldn\u2019t you at least explore different paths, meet different characters, and for the love of God question yourself: \u201cHow did I get here?\u201d or \u201cHow do I get out of this place?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIn other similar shows like SAO, GATE and KonoSuba, the main character voluntarily travels to a fantasy world, so he doesn\u2019t need to find a way out of it since he knows what he\u2019s doing. So why does Subaru who is suddenly transported to another world take the situation so lightly that he doesn\u2019t even TRY to escape. He accepts everything that happens to him AND everyone that he meets without using his brain.\\n\r\nInstead of searching for a way out of this world or getting rid of the curse, he ends up hunting for waifus, from maids to princesses to cat girls, because to him that\u2019s more important than safety. \\n\\n\r\nSubaru is one of those main characters who pretends to be the \u201cknow-it-all\u201d but actually has zero intelligence. He doesn\u2019t do anything in this show; it\u2019s that simple. Instead, he just let the other characters do their job as he sits idly, claiming that he will save everyone. Hell, he even admits it later. There\u2019s one sentence that could sum up his personality: \u201cGo with the flow\u201d. And by flow I mean plot. Subaru\u2019s role is to blindly follow the plot without thinking twice. He repeats the same mistakes over and over again because he NEEDS to die so he can reset everything or wait for something \u201cshocking\u201d to happen in the end of the episode. In other words, he acts this way for the sake of the drama-cycle (so he can die, reset, then die again\u2026)\\n\\n\r\nSubaru\u2019s second role is to over-dramatize the show, either by making an irrational decision, regretting it later and blaming himself for everything (even though it\u2019s not his fault. He feels guilty because he knows he can do something about it but doesn\u2019t) or becoming completely traumatized and unable to speak. One of the writer\u2019s main objectives is to show us a development of his mental state (from best to worse) but it becomes exaggerated and too dramatic. There\u2019s a whole episode where he doesn\u2019t speak a single word because he witnessed another death: he has given up, but he hasn\u2019t done anything AT ALL so how can he easily give up? Death is a serious matter, but not when you can reset it by time-travelling. It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re taking advantage of it, since this will help you avoid it next time by exploring different possibilities. I don\u2019t want to spoil another anime, but go watch Magical Girl Madoka and you\u2019ll know what I mean. \\n\\n\r\nSubaru also changes his behavior every time the plot demands it. Sometimes, he makes a scene because the show needs more drama. Sometimes, he doesn\u2019t and completely turns off his psychological scars by pretending nothing happened because the drama needs to cool off at some point. He saves a maid who killed him once while pretending that she didn\u2019t. He ends up protecting a thief named Felt while pretending that she\u2019s not the reason why he and Emilia died in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru wants to feel like a main character even though he\u2019s not, at least not to me. You can almost hear his screams \u201cNotice me! I\u2019m important too\u201d when he throws a tantrum in the royal selections episode and gets mad at anyone who insults Emilia, even in the episode where a Knight simply kissed her hand showing his respect towards her. On the other hand, Subaru acts like an ex-boyfriend who\u2019s still overprotective towards his supposed girlfriend. He claims that he\u2019s a Knight that\u2019s going to protect her in a room full of Imperial Knights while wearing a track suit and shouting like a complete idiot but that\u2019s just too pathetic because he simply can\u2019t. Everyone knows that. He knows that. Consequently, Subaru is beyond pathetic and cringe-worthy. He shouts that he\u2019s going to save everyone and two minutes later he runs away begging for people to help him, to the point that he was willing to lick the foot of a princess. Yes, that\u2019s how far he was going. \\n\\n\r\nAfter episode 18, Re:Zero becomes another \u201cFind the missing Main Character\u201d game (similar to Tokyo Ghoul Root A), where you have to question yourself: Who is the main character in this show? Is it Wilhelm, a Knight who suddenly becomes important to the plot and defeats the enemies in one swing of his sword? Is it Julius, a respectable spirit knight who acts as Subaru\u2019s personal bodyguard? Or is it Subaru, the supposed main character who can only act as bait using his witch scent?\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 18, Subaru becomes self-aware and finally accepts his character: \u201cWhat I am now is the result. All my powerlessness, all my incompetence, is the product of my rotten character (\u2026) That\u2019s right. I have no character\u201d. If he was aware of his character the whole time, why didn\u2019t he do anything about it? Why wait an endless 18 episodes to do so? And here\u2019s the worse part: his character transformation is too sudden. After Rem\u2019s speech, his personality makes a 180\u2070: he becomes smart, patient and calm. This long speech barely seems convincing and powerful to completely turn a person\u2019s personality upside down. It\u2019s the personality that we\u2019re talking about: it\u2019s almost a built-in feature that you are born or raised with and it\u2019s too difficult to change that quickly. It takes months, even years. And using Rem\u2019s love confession is a weak excuse as it doesn\u2019t suddenly make him a better person: it takes time.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no convincing character transformation, like the one we see in Tokyo Ghoul (where the MC was mistreated during the whole show and almost tortured to death before becoming a complete badass). Even though his character is written that way to make you hate him and then watch him overcome his flaws, it takes up to 18 episodes and in the end it doesn\u2019t really succeed. After \u201cSubaru\u2019s second form\u201d, he becomes a completely different person: calm, reasonable, smart... A true gentleman who admits his mistakes and forgives his enemies. It\u2019s impossible to believe that 1 episode ago he was the same character. Subaru 2.0 still asks people for help because he can\u2019t do anything on his own and acts as bait the whole time while others defeat the enemies. So what really changed in all of this? He made one good decision (a deal with a princess) and that was it. Then what\u2019s the problem? He\u2019s still weak and useless, but everyone accepts him as their hero and start helping him out for no reason: he gets his own army at his command, even though before no one knew about his existence and if they did they though he was a complete idiot. His character transformation is like night and day: one second he was irrational, stupid and thinks that he\u2019s Rambo and then 1 episode later after one simple love confession everyone thinks of him as Napoleon executing the perfect plan or Gotham\u2019s next Batman saving the entire city? I don\u2019t buy this. \\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, Re:Zero becomes another shonen after the MC\u2019s \u201ctransformation\u201d. Rem made it very clear to us when she kept insisting that Subaru is her Prince Charming. There are different factors involved. I\u2019ve counted three so far: \\n\\n\r\n1) He informs the people about the whereabouts of the White Whale (a floating monster), because apparently nobody in this world can use their magic powers or a simple magic spell to track it down. \\n\\n\r\n2) In every single fight, he acts as bait using his witch scent while others defeat the enemy.\\n\\n\r\n3) He risks his life by acting as bait again, and saves a random maid he barely knows by doing so. Not to mention that the risk is non-existent to him since he can reset time the moment he dies.\\n\\n\r\nDoesn\u2019t this seem a little bit insulting to other heroes out there, who try their best to defeat the enemy, using their different set of physical and mental skills? I\u2019m not even convinced that Subaru is a main character, so how can I believe that he becomes a hero later?\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the overuse of soliloquy (a situation where the protagonist speaks his thoughts out loud so he can indirectly address himself to us). Subaru keeps screaming out loud \"OMG. I'm awesome!\", \"I look great!\" and \"I'm garbage\" so he can highlight his character. He points out clich\u00e9s to tell us \"See? I'm aware of that, so it's not a clich\u00e9!\".\\n\\n\r\n2) SECONDARY CHARACTERS: Well, let\u2019s start will the main heroine Emilia. She is a kind and caring person but in reality she\u2019s simply a cheap fan service element for a barely developed and non-reciprocal romance. She\u2019s very naive as she welcomes Subaru into her home after knowing the guy for no more than 10 minutes and that he smelled like the Witch (a very despised figure in the show). In addition, Emilia\u2019s character doesn\u2019t get enough development and this seems crucial since the whole show is driven by the relationship between Subaru and Emilia. Think about it: if you remove her then everything else will lose its meaning: the maids, Subaru\u2019s objective and decisions\u2026 Emilia can be considered as a plot engine, and some characters even admit it. Ram acknowledge Subaru as \u201cEmilia\u2019s dog\u201d (actual line), not only because he acts as one (he barks at people he doesn\u2019t like and defends his master without thinking) but also because the story wouldn\u2019t have made any sense if his master was not in it. Isn\u2019t this the plot device of the whole show: a relationship between a dog and his master? So why give more attention to side characters like Rem & Ram? Let\u2019s analyze then each character so we can see for ourselves:\\n\\n\r\n-Rem: a bipolar maid with no fixed personality. She starts as a kuudere, becomes a yandere and slaughters everyone, goes back to being cold to Subaru, goes completely insane, then becomes surprisingly kind, but later on turns into a typical tsuundere who can\u2019t admit that she\u2019s in love. So instead of creating more maids, the writer decided to mix all the possible personalities you can come up with into one bowl of a character, thinking that he created a character development instead. Rem acts as a supporting character as well as a fan service one. Try to remember what happened in episode 18: she falls in love with Subaru while telling us (and not him) a fantasy about them living together and having kids that we know will never happen so we can fantasize about it. And of course, she\u2019s just another mindless puppet who makes the drama look even more dramatic by acting irrational all the time and getting herself killed. Her actions barely help the story and the MC. In fact, she once ran away from Subaru and went to the mansion all by herself only to be brutally killed. This was the only safe and logical decision she could think of. But in reality, she was just following the drama path: to shock and traumatize Subaru when he finds out that everyone is dead.\\n\\n\r\n-Ram: Rem\u2019s twin sister with a dull personality, unless you consider \u201ccold and irrational\u201d a type of personality. Her character design is almost the same as Rem\u2019s (except for her hair color) but surprisingly she\u2019s not giving any importance at all. She\u2019s there because the writer needed a background story for Rem, then decided to throw her away since she did her job. In episode 23, she comes back, only this time to kill Subaru and his entire army because he left the mansion and ran away from his master: \u201cSo this is what it means to bite the hand that feeds you\u201d. It was Emilia who asked Subaru to leave the mansion in the first place after they got into a fight and NOT him running away to a new master without telling anyone. It was a simple request, not a betrayal. So if she can\u2019t even tell the difference, what can she really do?\\n\\n\r\n3) SIDE CHARACTERS: Almost all the side characters seem completely static and hold no real meaning in the show. They are there because the story is not crowded enough and the writer needs some fillers.\\n\\n\r\n-Wilhelm: His Sword training with Subaru doesn\u2019t change anything. It\u2019s just to show us that the MC is actually trying to do something for once, that he\u2019s trying his best, but he fails in doing so and finally admits it. Wilhelm is suddenly giving more attention than primary characters when he got his own flashback about how he met his wife. He can almost be considered as a main character replacement for Subaru.\\n\\n\r\n-Beatrice: a tsuundere loli who despises Subaru but ironically enjoys his company. She tries to help him by convincing Rem that he\u2019s innocent but apparently that led to his suicide. \\n\\n\r\n-Reinhard: a.k.a \u201cMr. Nice Guy\u201d. He\u2019s an angel, a saint who helps Subaru out of the goodness of his heart but later on abducts a harmless child. Lolicon confirmed?\\n\\n\r\n-Felt: too childish and ignorant. She blindly follows Reinhard without resisting and becomes one of the eligible candidates for becoming the ruler, only to ask him in a room full of princesses, Imperial Knights and people: \u201cWhy did you bring me here, and why am I dressed like that?\u201d (most likely to relieve the tension). \\n\\n\r\n-Felis: your typical cat-girl who turns out to be a boy even though he acts, speaks, and looks like a girl. His job is to look cute and help others without interfering with the harem (like the one in Highschool DxD).\\n\\n\r\n-Julius: a spirit knight who takes his role very seriously, until he becomes Subaru\u2019s pet and obeys any order he gives him without complaining. \\n\\n\r\n-Roswaal Mathers: because the show needs another clown besides Subaru. He acts and speaks like a clown. That's his only unique trait.\\n\\n\r\n- Betelgeuse (In English \u201cBeetle Juice\u201d): One of the 7 Sin-Archbishop representing Sloth. He reminds me of Nobuyuki Sugou: a one-dimensional, too-evil villain who becomes a joke in the show due to his funny way of speaking and acting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for the good elements:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022ART & ANIMATION: The art looks really good and is actually nice to look at. The background scenes are noticeable enough and more detailed than usual. The choreographic scenes are fun to watch, others become repetitive but that\u2019s fine. In conclusion, the art & animation is overall enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022SOUND: The voice acting was acceptable except for some characters like Bettelgeuse: it was too high-pitched and was a pain to the ears. We get that he\u2019s a villain but trying to make his voice as ugly and insane as he looks is just too much that he eventually becomes some sort of a joke in the show. We look at him and all we see is a Joker-wannabe but with a really annoying voice. Another voice acting that was supposed to be funny became extremely distracting and ruined the whole mood: Roswaal Mathers\u2019 voice. It even makes you question his sexuality. \\n\\n\r\nOther voices are good, like Rem & Ram (same voice actress), Emilia, and most male characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was also great. I never skipped it. Same thing for the ED, except I didn\u2019t listen to it every time. I was too busy trying to figure out the ending.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022CONCLUSION: In a nutshell, Re:Zero is an obvious cliched fantasy that tries its best to appeal to the general public. What I mean by that is the typical \u201cedgy\u201d cliffhangers, the time-travel, the fantasy elements (cute maids, princesses, Knights\u2026 the usual), the horror elements (blood and gore\u2026 so it can look serious and addressed to adults), the melodrama (way too much), the harem... Now try imaging a show that has all of those elements and more. No wonder you\u2019ll get a messy, scrambled anime that is not just confusing, but painful to watch. \\n\r\nRe:Zero has a tendency to introduce certain characters but later on completely dispose of them as they were mere paper characters. Now the characters are one thing, but take a look at the story line: it\u2019s not linear nor episodic. It\u2019s lazy and filled with useless and boring arcs. It\u2019s a whole bunch of stories, like a small book that you read to your child at night: it doesn\u2019t make any sense but it\u2019s a good way to make him fall asleep quickly. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022ENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI never enjoyed a single second in this show. Why should I? The story is divided into stories, the main character is pathetic, useless, and acts like an idiot but suddenly becomes the hero we all need by acting as bait the whole time. Some episodes were rushed, others were mere fillers and the cliffhangers are always there, whether they make sense or not. Fan service and forced drama win in the end, because that\u2019s what people want nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this? Well, let\u2019s see:\\n\\n\r\nDo you like to watch a bunch of unrelated stories, each one in a different genre?\\n\\n\r\nDo you enjoy watching a completely useless and static main character similar to a statue?\\n\\n\r\nDo you have a problem with abusive drama and cliffhangers that don\u2019t make any sense?\\n\\n\r\nAfter you answer each question, you'll know what to do.\\n",

            "content": "This review may contain mild spoilers as argumentative points.\r\n**And before the review starts , there is something I would like to address which I found quite concerning. I've seen a lot of the reviewers that rate this 5 or below say this is just another generic harem series. Great criticism except that its makes zero sense. In the series we have one girl that loves the main character (arguably two during the very last scene) , the others find him interesting but not enough for it to be in a romantic sense. Its the equivalent of calling Higurashi or KonoSuba a harem series**\r\nThat being saidlets get onto: \\n\\n\r\n---Story\\n\\n\r\nTime travel is a difficult concept to get right. Either you do it great like Steins;Gate or you mess it up and get a load of plotholes like Charlotte. Thankfully I would say Re:Zero does this right. This shows gimmick is that the main characters is somewhat of a video game character in an RPG. The setting might get a bit repetitive occasionally but with wildly different outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has what I believe to be one of the strongest starts I've seen in an anime in a while. Rating off the first few episodes alone they would easily be 10/10s. Unfortunately the series does become a little bit more mediocre in the later episodes , in some moments forgetting what the series was meant to be about.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 1/2\\n\\n\r\n---Characters\\n\\n\r\nLets start with our main character. When a character is perfect they are criticized for being a Gary Stu. But in this series the character design of our main character is being judged by critics specifically because he has flaws. I don't quite understand the double standard.\\n\\n\r\nSome people say Subaru is unrealistic because he is cringy. I couldn't disagree more. Subaru is a realistic character precisely because HE IS cringy. In fact I know someone in real life who has pretty much the same personality as Subaru. Subaru uses his special ability to fix things he messed up in the past via time travel. Somewhat akin to Steins;Gate in *STEINS SPOILER ALERT* saving Mayushii.  \\n\\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine why Subaru would keep using his power over and over to make things perfect , as a Shut-in NEET this is all he has. Subaru also seems to have developed a crush on Emilia probably because she is the first girl that is ever really nice to him. And as a person who knows NEETs this is about as real as it gets. I do call shenanigans on how physically strong Subaru is however but this isn't a massive deal. He also doesn't seem overly shocked about coming to this world , but perhaps he has already \"experienced\" it via anime and video games.\\n\\n\r\nFor Emilia she is overly nice and polite but is not afraid to verbally destroy some people , aka Subaru. She seems like a capable fighter but not nearly as strong without her familiar Puck.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main female character later on would be the ever-so-famous Rem but I cannot speak about her in too much detail without spoiling anything.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero has an array of flawed , realistic and likeable characters which is something that is not too common with a series this popular.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 2/2\\n\\n\r\n---Sound and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening. That has to be one of the best openings I have seen in a very long time. When you have an intro song that I would listen to even without the video you know you did something right. The animation isn't revolutionary or with film-quality but its pretty damn close.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects and Voice actors stood out to me as being excellent as well. Plenty of emotions with the voice actors as well as some sound effects unique to this series. Unfortunately other than the first opening there was no actual OST song that was able to grasp me.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation : 2/2 \\n\\n\r\nSound : 1/2*\\n\r\n*The highest one I can possibly give.\\n\\n\r\n---Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nLately most anime fail to make an impression on me and quickly bore me. After seeing a good amount of anime I would say around 80 to 90% bore me due to being able to predict everything that happens.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero does not have this.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to rate this series based on enjoyment alone it would hands down be a 10.\\n\\n\r\nI would really , really like to give this an 9 or 10 but writing this as a critic I simply can't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/2\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero is an anime that has the potential to become a modern classic and will be greatly enjoyable to anyone who watches this with a fan perspective rather than a critically minded one. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it isn't perfect which prevents me from giving this a 10 or even a 9 but this is the highest 8 I could possibly give to a series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8",

            "content": "Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu (Re: Zero -Starting Life in Another World-)\r\nArt/Characters: The art style of this show is pretty similar to the rest of shows in today\u2019s anime. Being able to see the way the outfits of each individual character really made the world come alive. Even the characters that wear the same outfit each time they are seen, they still have a uniqueness to them that makes it seem non-repetitive. The colors here are also one of the most vivid and bright in any show that I have seen. The use of rainbows and different colors to focus on different characters make themreally stand out. As for each of the individual characters, they each had very real and very unique personalities that made the show really fun to watch. With Subaru at the helm and main characters like Rem, Emilia, and even Julius to some degree give the show a depth that is unmatched by any show I have seen thus far. I also really love the detail that the illustrators put into the little things, like being able to see the reflections of a person in another characters eyes. Subaru\u2019s character concept, a NEET being ripped out of his life and placed in somewhere completely new, but is a little reminiscent of something like Familiar of Zero.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: The music of Re:Zero is some of the most memorable and enjoyable that I have heard this season. Being able to recall that stinger sound when every the moment was heavy and terrifying still brings a chill down my spine. There are also a few songs that stir emotions in me, but in the interest of no spoilers, I won\u2019t say when those songs appear but there are songs that are so amazing that I still listen to them and I will continue to listen to them for a long time after. As for the rest of the sound throughout the show, it made the world so expansive and so fulfilling that I felt like I was truly part of the world of Re:Zero. \\n\\n\r\nStory: In a phrase: one for the ages. I really had no idea what I was getting into when I watched the first episode of Re:Zero but the concept of a person, much like myself, could get removed from his life and dropped into a new place filled with new people, it just blows my mind. I have seen it done before, but not quite to this scale. The plot device of return-by-death is really interesting and really does a great job of blurring the line between RPG and Anime. Once Subaru has been dropped into this world, he happens upon a woman who has had her insignia stolen, and upon trying to help her find it, Subaru and the woman are very brutally murdered. As if that would be the end of the story, Subaru snaps out of a trance to speak with someone he spoke to upon arrival. Confused and lost, he isn\u2019t sure what has happened to him, but he will do anything he can to change his future.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: When you sit down to watch a new show a few things are taken into consideration. The poster art, the PV, how many episodes, the art style, etc. But for this, I knew next to nothing. I saw the art, \u201cthat looks cool\u201d and that the first episode was split into two parts, \u201calright\u201d. I anticipated it to be something similar to a show like Sword Art Online because of the fantasy setting, but I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The emotions that I felt while watching this show; the moments where my jaw would DROP because the credits began to roll at a cliff hanger. I was so invested and I loved it so much that I wasn\u2019t able to shut up about it. The colors, the music, the sounds, the characters (I\u2019m on Team Emilia by the way, haters gonna hate), and ultimately the world that I became a part of. I felt for Subaru because I have been in situations that make one susceptible to falling in love and doing absolutely everything possible to keep the ones you love safe. When things happen that break my heart, I go numb and can\u2019t take my eyes away from the screen. There were literally times when the credits would roll and I couldn\u2019t skip past them because I was in shock. While I absolutely loved this show, I would say there are a few plot holes and I am a little upset that they didn\u2019t develop some characters as well as they did others, but I am hoping and praying for a season two to be announced soon. Please, please, please, if you haven\u2019t already seen Re:Zero, watch it, love it, experience it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 9.9/10\\n",

            "content": "Now that I've finished Re:Zero I am writing my first review based on it. \r\nRe:Zero is a great take on the Isekai anime style that changes a lot of the genre standards. I was hyped up for this show since i discovered that it was going to be in production sometime in January or February of 2016. When it finally aired I eagerly anticipated every episode from week to week waiting to see where the story of Subaru, Emilia, and all the others would go. It was one of the first anime I've seen in a long time that I really wanted to keep upwith and that i thoroughly enjoyed every week even if something terrible happened in the episode. I fully enjoyed the art and music of the show as both were extraordinarily good and fit the show really well. Overall though, the best part of the show is arguably its character development, and watching Subaru evolve to solve his problems these last 25 weeks has been extremely entertaining. I give this show a 10/10 and I am happy to say that it has 1-upped Steins Gate as my personal favorite anime. I highly recommend giving Re:Zero a watch and I look forward to waiting to seeing if, once more light novel chapters are done, White Fox will give us a season 2.",

            "content": "Re:Zero started out amazing for the first four episodes, became average but still entertaining enough midway through, and then ultimately became a complete terrible farce in the last third. \r\nThe characters are just downright awful.\r\nThe main character, Subaru, is a selfish entitled self-centred cunt. Which is fine at first because that's the way the he was written to be, and the story punishes his actions and attitude. But in the last third of the series, one by one all the characters start sucking the main character's cock. All of a sudden Subaru can do nothing wrong and everyone kisses his feet. He hasn't changed onebit, he's every bit the same cunt that he was at the start, but suddenly the show is rewarding him. \\n\\n\r\nRem starts out pretty interesting, but in time becomes nothing but flatly-written waifu bait. There are multi-dimensional fascinating characters that would also happen to make a great waifu, and there are characters that exist for the sole reason of pandering to the viewers. Rem unfortunately is the latter. There's zero personality or thought behind any of her actions other than being in love with the main character. Her character development died the moment she fell for Subaru.\\n\\n\r\nEmilia is your generic nice girl, and just when she starts showing the least bit of development, when she calls out Subaru for his bullshit and tells him to fuck off, she then gets shafted for the rest of the series. Subaru's so-called \"love\" for Emila is nothing but toxic possessiveness; at one point he even says \"you should have a greater debt to me than you could ever repay\".\\n\\n\r\nThe show is that it ends up being the complete opposite of what it set out to do. It ends up being nothing but a self-insert wish-fulfilment fantasy. I'll be the one to say it: Sword Art Online season 1 as whole is better than Re:Zero; at least it never tries to pretend that its anything more than the fulfilment fantasy it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe selection of candidates for the throne? All shifted aside to watch the main character playing hero. Why he was transported into this alternate dimension? Not explained. Why the main character can keep reviving time after time when he dies? Not explained. Why can he only revive at particular save points, which change throughout? Not explained. Why even bother? The writers can just throw anything they want into the story without any explanation.\\n\\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the atrocious writing. Subaru's so-called PTSD magically appears and then goes away at random; whichever is more convenient for the plot at that point in time. His supposed turning point in the series goes something like this:\\n\\n\r\nSubaru: I AM USELESS I HATE MYSELF\\n\r\nRem: I LOVE YOU SUBARU\\n\r\nSubaru: OK, I AM FANTASTIC AND I LOVE EMILIA :D LoOoOL, HELP ME SAVE HER?\\n\r\nRem: YES! :)))))))\\n\\n\r\nAtrocious.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does this show prove? Just add a bit of gore and deaths and edginess and everyone with circlejerk over it and go all \"2dark2deep4u\". If this show is supposedly the \"saviour of anime\", then the entire medium is beyond redemption. Just look at all the waifu wars amongst the show's fans, it shows you what kind of target audience is intended for the show. If not for the brilliant first four episodes I would rate the show even lower. Don't waste your time on this, its overrated, overhyped, utterly pretentious, and not worth watching.",

            "content": "OK summary- Re:zero is a story about a neet named Subaru. He gets transported to a fantasy world. he has no idea how he got there, but is amazed of what happens. he meets an elf named Satella(?), and helps here retrieve something stolen from her as thanks for helping him out. they make it to the thieves hide out, and Subaru and Satella die, as Suburu closes his eyes one last time, they suddenly reopen and he finds himself back at where he started. he finds out he can time reset after death and that's where the story starts kinda. \r\nsounds like a coolpremise,huh, but here is why it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-The animation for the anime is above average, the character designs are good, the fights look awesome and have impact, and the setting looks beautiful at times. however you can see where they cut corners. the background characters in large areas are CGI it's not hard to notice but it's there and it is bothersome. despite me saying they have good character design most of them feel underwhelming. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- Is forgettable, that's it really. it's there and fits, but doesn't stand out. the voice acting is OK, when it comes to screaming pains of agony. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nStory- From the summary what I told you sounds like an interesting premise, right? but that's really it an interesting premise. Subaru suffering shows how bad an idea someone surviving a fantasy world can be, but because of time resets there are very little consequences. the time reset itself is more than plot armor, but one giant plot convenience that keeps the story going in circles until Subaru gets it right. what do you know everything turns out all right in the end, hur fukin ray! very little world building, very little stakes and motivation, and very little interesting characters. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- not much to say they're mostly all two dimensional characters. they just react to the situation without really growing, and any changes just revert back to zero (get it!). However rem is best girl because she has more depth and growth than any other character in the show, even with the resets(blue haired girl). 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-From all the episodes there are only three that kept my interest, which where the action ones. the final assassin fight and the white. whale subjugation. The only reason is because it's only where animation shines the most,and the story can be forgotten for a while. 3/25 episodes\\n\\n\r\nSummary- Good animation,OK sound and voice acting, bad story and character, and didn't enjoy it that much. Anything impressive only lasted a while and in retrospect where quite lackluster. 4/10",

            "content": "Hi, I'm going to write a simple review. I did not like the anime and I am going to explain why.\r\n[Story: ]\r\nThe events were boring. There was no buildup to anything and all that seemed to happen in the show was a psychopath or beast killed the protagonist and his friends over and over, and the protagonist tried to stop them from dying. I think in the entire show the only buildup to an event or murder was that the murderer or beast was mentioned in a passing conversation. Like \"hey watch out for that whale, it's bad news\" was it and *poof* there's thewhale.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting was a boring anime fantasy.. There were no cool powers, no interesting villains, no realistic depictions of economy, war, or politics. It's baffling how anyone makes a fantasy setting boring and generic given the potential to do anything with it, but Re:Zero somehow accomplished me being bored in a fantasy setting, which is exceedingly rare.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing was pretty bad. The series continually killed off characters, only to say \"not really\" to the audience over and over. The only tension was of the protagonist mental state since everyone in the show was effectively immortal, regardless of how much the protagonist cried over each of their deaths, even after the 4th time it happened.  Then there is the fact that no one the show seems to have any real motivation outside of undying servitude to a princess or evil witch.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/animation]\\n\r\nMediocre animation. A couple of animation cheats such as reused animation or repetitive jump cuts, but for the most part it's simply \"passable.\" Not much to say outside of \"nothing interesting/new to see here.\"\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\r\nMediocre soundtrack that was used extremely poorly.  Re:Zero tries to baby the audience by putting a \"whoo-wee-whoo\" at every sign of something bad, often in a much too obvious manner. The soundtrack itself is forgettable fantasy anime soundtrack #76, but it was also played extremely low in the background throughout the anime, making a lot of scenes almost dead quite with the exception of a few twangs every now and then.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\r\nSubaru is a polarizing mess. He's poorly written, has inconsistent mood swings and changes of character, and is generally an idiot about everything to an unrealistic degree. His backstory is completely forgotten by episode one and there seems to be no real reason to make him from an alternate dimension outside of Japanese otaku self-inserting themselves into him.\\n\\n\r\nEmilia is basically non-existent for over half of the anime, despite being a major focus of Subaru's actions and motivations. If you want to note something about her note how little of a connection she and Subaru have and how big it is played out.\\n\\n\r\nRem is the \"too good for this world\" character who develops so fast from her original \"shy but psycho\" personality that it's almost as if the author replaced her with a clone halfway through.\\n\\n\r\nWilhelm is probably the only character within the show I view as being good. He has a consistent backstory and motivation for his actions. Sadly he's sidelined and his entire existence is merely defined as a side-character by his position alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest are forgettable archetypes. Loli's, tsunderes, white-knights, traps, the whole shibang you see in almost every fantasy series.\\n\\n\r\n[Final thoughts]\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero remains to me what is a growing problem with the industry, that anime are put out in mediocre condition with no desire to go anywhere or do anything but be another fantasy anime among hundreds. Sure, it got hype and success because of calculated marketing decisions regarding characters, but I'm sure it's not going to stand the test of time.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure that I'll look back on this series and rate it lower thanks to it's terribly low rewatchability due to it's reliance on shockfactor/plot-twist/edge, but for now it's a solid 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not the worse anime ever produced, it's not terrible. But it's certainly got a lot more fundamental problems than other anime have.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Re:Zero is one of those shows that can completely alter the way you look at anime. After all, it is a popular adage that you shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover. And yet, that is exactly what I did when I first looked upon its PV\u2019s and early impressions. At the time, it looked to me like a weird Sword Art Online clone and could thus, be safely ignored. But as the summer season rolled on, the show continued to hold its high aggregate score and the hype and forum buzz was only getting stronger and stronger. Like a moth drawn to a flame,I decided, against my better judgement, to follow the crowd and give this Re:Zero thing a try. To my dismay, what I found may not have been quite Sword Art Online, but it certainly wasn\u2019t much better\u2026\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\n\tDespite this show\u2019s many problems that I will be discussing, the story is without a doubt one of the weakest parts of Re:Zero. It begins with our main protagonist Natsuki Subaru, a loser NEET who has nothing in life besides video games and radio calisthenics, being randomly transported into a fantasy world. Only a little confused, but mostly pants-shittingly excited, our hero proceeds to run into an alley and get mugged by the anime three-stooges. To his luck he is saved by a half-elven girl named Emilia and proceeds to follow her around as she chases after a loli thief girl that stole her precious insignia. As this subplot plods along, Subaru discovers three things: 1) when he dies, he is sent back into a random/convenient place in time, reminiscent of a video game checkpoint. 2) He really sucks at staying alive. And 3) for reasons unknown, he is really into this Emilia chick.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Re:Zero\u2019s plot has a lot going on and it would be difficult and very spoilery to sit here and summarize much more of it. But what the plot has in quantity, it certainly doesn\u2019t hold any weight in the quality department. The show will have you scratching your head from the very beginning as Subaru is transported into this fantasy world for seemingly no reason and without any process. He doesn\u2019t fall through a worm hole, doesn\u2019t get cursed by a roadside fortune teller, and he didn\u2019t purchase a VR headset at his local convenience store. He simply walks outside, blinks, and he\u2019s in it. Even if you are desperate to have your modern Japanese hero have his adventure in a fantasy world, the least you can do as a writer is try to explain it, and this is never touched upon again in the series.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe other big problem with Re:Zero\u2019s plot is that there is no overarching goal that is presented for our protagonist and his \u201cfriends\u201d to work towards. He seems perfectly happy to be stuck in this world, so it\u2019s not like there is any sort of desire to leave. He certainly never even bothers to accurately convey where he is from to any of the characters, instead insisting that he is from the Eastern most country of this fantasy world, despite already being in the eastern most country of this fantasy world. Nobody ever really questions him on this or finds it suspicious, either. There is something about the Demi Human War, but that\u2019s never touched upon again despite the implications that humans hold a secret, racist prejudice towards these Demi Humans. In fact, aside from Emilia and her half-elven roots, no other Demi Human seems to be persecuted in any way, no matter how bad their CG models are. There are also no other elves for some reason, but I guess that\u2019s not important. There is talk of a powerful Dragon and a mystical Evil Witch, but even that is given little context besides \u201cEvil Witch bad, must not be named until next season is confirmed!\u201d \\n\\n\r\n        No, Subaru\u2019s seemingly only goal in this universe is to get into Emilia\u2019s pants as he instantly clings to her as his sole reason for living and follows her around from subplot to subplot like a clingy puppy desperate for affection. This gives the plot a meandering feeling as Subaru and friends jump around from one contrived predicament to another, regardless of how loosely they are connected and how little they contribute to the world as a whole. They start with a little subplot about a loli thief stealing an insignia that is coveted by both Emilia and some psycho assassin lady with huge boobs. Once that is resolved, those characters are recycled as Subaru and Emilia go hang out in a mansion. There, they find new characters and a subplot about how Subaru must find a way to contrive his new, slice-of-life/romcom life with Emilia, all while learning how to be a subpar butler and avoiding being brutally murdered every night by evil stuff. Once the hilariously random identity of the killer is revealed and the subplot finds its way to its cringey, happy ending, THESE characters all get recycled as Subaru and Emilia head back to the city to have a subplot about some political election. \\n\\n\r\n         This goes on and on and on and on. From political election to bad love triangle, from bad love triangle to random killer whale, from random killer whale to evil witch cult, all the way to a stunningly underwhelming conclusion where nothing is really accomplished, but everything is setup for future seasons of the show. That\u2019s right, the show isn\u2019t over. And, considering how many characters and subplots Re:Zero has managed to introduce in such a short time, the show could conceivably last another two or three seasons depending on how badly the author decides to stretch it out. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n \tAs bad as they all are to me, I think it is safe to say that the characters are a rather mixed bag. This is, at least, true for everyone except for Subaru. It is my belief that entire college theses, if not books and novels, can be written on just what an awful protagonist Natsuki Subaru is. In many ways, he is a monstrous amalgamation of all of the worst traits of the protagonists that have come before him. The most obvious trait would be his ADHD hyper activeness that could give Naruto and One Piece\u2019s Luffy a run for their money.  Get ready to cringe as Subaru disco poses his way into every scene, regardless of how brutally he was murdered just a second ago, all while spouting meta dialogue/commentary about anything and everything that just happened, giving all the characters stupid and embarrassing nicknames, making anime (Evangelion, primarily) and video game references, and desperately trying to flirt with a thick girl in ways that would make even the most clueless of shut-ins and guys who flirt with Wal-Mart cashiers want to kill themselves. \\n\\n\r\n           From the book of Emiya Shirou, Subaru borrows the unshakable belief that he is born to be a hero of justice and must therefore, chauvinistically, defend everything with a vagina from the forces of evil, despite the fact that the people he is protecting are far more capable than he. At the very least Shirou eventually learns how to fight, whilst Subaru\u2019s greatest strengths end up his uncanny abilities to run away, scream, cry, and be bait while other characters do all of the work that he then takes credit for. Also Shirou\u2019s chauvinism is born of a na\u00efve, goody two-shoes personality, while Subaru\u2019s is born of, according to episode 13, a personality that is selfish and egotistical in nature. Lastly, he totally stole Shirou\u2019s track suit jacket from Unlimited Blade Works, but that\u2019s not nearly as egregious. Amongst many other traits, there is Ikari Shinji\u2019s pension for running away and crying like a bitch, Makoto Itou\u2019s uncanny ability to treat the women closest to him like garbage, and Kirito\u2019s overall blandness. There is a small part towards the middle where Subaru shows off a little self-awareness of just what an awful piece of shit he really is, but it\u2019s short, by then the damage is done, and he pivots back into being an annoying, unlikable, duffus immediately afterwards, so it\u2019s kinda wasted.\\n\\n\r\n            We then have the two Asuna\u2019s of the show, Emilia and Rem, who appropriately start off as seemingly strong, independent characters, before they are robbed of their spines and forced to serve as ego boosts for our infamous protagonist. Coincidentally, these two are mainly remarkable because of their involvement in the love triangle of the series. First there\u2019s Emilia, whose design of white hair, white clothes, and white accessories perfectly alludes to her character, as she has the blandness of milk and the \u201cspecial\u201d status of a snowflake. What starts off as a strong and confident (if shy) character who isn\u2019t afraid to frown or squint, quickly turns into a mo\u00e9blob of sweetness and innocence once Subaru \u201csaves\u201d her and establishes his superiority. After a while, she can\u2019t even be upset with Subaru without seeming apologetic for it, and that\u2019s before the show relegates her to be a damsel in distress who conveniently forgets she has ice magic and a furry guardian spirit capable of turning into a giant wolf-bear monster that can freeze anything in a 100 mile radius. Clearly that\u2019s not good enough, so best to just sit in a wagon/castle and let useless Subaru fumble his way through everything.\\n\\n\r\n          Second there\u2019s Rem, whose sexy maid outfit perfectly foreshadows her degeneration from a badass killing machine to a blushing doormat. Rem, and by extension her sister Ram, is one of the few characters in this show that has an actual backstory. Even our protagonist isn\u2019t blessed with such a miracle, so when you see a backstory told in this show, it actually stands out. Rem\u2019s is, fortunately, good and this makes her a rather interesting character with at least an ounce of depth. Combine that with her giant flail and Unit-01-esque \u201cBerserker\u201d mode, and you have an early favorite for a lot of viewers, me included. This, too, goes away once Subaru \u201csaves\u201d her from bad, CG wolf monsters. From that point on, Rem is relegated to walk around in Subaru\u2019s shadow as she showers him with love and ensures him that he isn\u2019t a total piece of shit. Her status as a doormat comes to fruition in an infamous scene where, after being rejected by our idiot protagonist, Rem happily accepts his offer to be a cuckold as she puts her life on the line to help Subaru get into Emilia\u2019s pants. I found this turn of events pretty disgusting, and I wasn\u2019t even shipping these two.\\n\\n\r\n           None of the other characters are particularly remarkable. The previously mentioned loli thief is turned into a one-dimensional anarchist. The show then introduces some bitchy, overconfident election rivals for Emilia, who I presume will actually be touched upon in future installments of the show. Crusch, the one we actually get to spend any time with, felt lacking besides the \u201cStorm Ruler\u201d that she clearly knicked from Demon\u2019s Souls. In her service, we have Ferris, a crossdressing catboy who is incredibly annoying, and Sir Wilhelm, an overpowered butler knight who honestly feels like he fell out of a different anime altogether and whose backstory is so clich\u00e9 that you\u2019ll wish the author just didn\u2019t even bother. It\u2019s not like you NEED to rip off Moby Dick to justify killing a never before mentioned giant whale monster that terrorizes the country side. There\u2019s also a red haired and a purple haired knight, but they are just muscle for Subaru to lean on in each half of the series. Back at the mansion we have a pedophile clown who owns the premises, but fucks off before anything interesting could actually happen to him. There is also Beatrice, who seemingly only exists to be the second coming of Suiseiseki as she tries to turn \u2018Kashira\u2019 into the modern version of the \u2018Desu\u2019 Meme. Quite possibly the best character of the show is Ram, Rem\u2019s older sister and possible sexual victim of the predatory clown man. Not only does she have a legitimately interesting backstory, but her personality and dialogue are more than tolerable and she becomes completely ignored long before Re:Zero has a chance to somehow drive her character into the ground. This is certainly more than I can say for the unimaginative psycho that is Betelgeuse, quite possible the worst villain I have ever seen. His array of abilities include invisible tentacle hands, somehow worse dialogue than Subaru, and a penchant for chewing soo much of the scenery that I\u2019m amazed the show doesn\u2019t end with a Sopranos-esque random cut to black.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation:\\n\\n\r\n\tI\u2019ll keep this section short, because if there is one thing this show does right, it\u2019s the art, animation, and music. Produced by White Fox, whose resume includes beautiful works like Steins;Gate and Katanagatari, it is no surprise to me that Re:Zero, at the very least, manages to look good. Great care is especially put into scenes of extreme, gory violence, which grab your attention even if you don\u2019t particularly care for the characters. Likewise, White Fox does a great job with Re:Zero\u2019s more touching moments, as the way girls like Rem and Emilia smile will send your heart straight to mo\u00e9 heaven, even if the girls aren\u2019t very heavenly themselves. The fight scenes also tend to look nice, especially when Wilhelm of Astrea is on the screen, tearing foes to pieces in a display of lightning fast flashes of blood smears. I also really liked the detail that went into the eyes of characters like Emilia and Beatrice, as it stood out in a rather charming way. My main nitpick would be with some of the uses of CG, as the Demi Humans and Ground Dragons rendered in CG looked and moved with that familiar CG awkwardness that is only emphasized by the drawn, 2D characters present in the same scenes.\\n\\n\r\n\tOn the music end, I enjoyed both the OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s for both halves of the season, with the first set being superior in typical anime tradition. Because I enjoyed them, though, it is kind of a shame that Re:Zero has a penchant for skipping them every other episode or so. Since there is nothing particularly remarkable musically within the actual show, it makes the exclusion of the OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s really stand out. What does stand out in the show is a track simply titled \u201cCreepy Sound\u201d. True to its title, any time anything \u201ccreepy\u201d happens in Re:Zero, a gaggle of Asian women hack out a high-pitched wail that makes my ears bleed and instantly robs the scene of any tension that it might have been trying to build up. Could have done without that, personally.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n\tRe:Zero\u2019s biggest crime is that it is unbearably and unbelievably boring. Re:Zero is the type of show that is soo damn proud of itself, that it garishly reveals its hand within the first few episodes and expects the viewer to revel in its genius as it plays the same hand over and over and over again. The show expects you to care about Subaru\u2019s death and suffering long before it establishes him as anything more than a generator of silly poses and pop culture references. It expects you to believe in an unshakable romance long before Subaru and Emilia have had any meaningful, romantic interactions together. The reason why superior shows like Steins;Gate and Higurashi managed to make this similar setup work is because they spend time on character growth and interaction before letting the shit hit the fan. They show the viewer all of the reasons for why they should care about these characters long before they are actually expected to.  \\n\\n\r\n          In between the few flashes of brilliance that the show actually has, are long stretches of what feels like filler as the show tries to space itself out with awkward dialogue, random subplots, and a seemingly endless reservoir of characters that it hopes will stick to the viewer long enough to get them through the slog. Despite all the allusions to Sword Art Online, Re:Zero is very clearly not a clone of said show. Despite failing miserably, it is clear that it is at least trying to be some kind of serious subversion/deconstruction of tropes with a Groundhog\u2019s Day premise that has an actual chance of being interesting further down the line. Sadly, my goodwill for this show has already been depleted by this \u201cprologue\u201d and I do not see myself returning for any more adventures with Subaru and friends. Just like our protagonist, I have suffered through this mind-numbing mess of an anime and I shall suffer it no more.\\n",

            "content": "+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\nPlot\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\nSo i\u2019v knows about this anime for a really long time, and it has been on my watch list for sometime now, but i put it off for awhile because looking at it first glance, i really thought that this anime wasn\u2019t going to be all that every says it is. In all honestly i really thought that this show was just going to be another generic anime full of bad overused tropes that degraded the quality of the show, another copy cat of all other anime that have come out. I personally didn\u2019t want to watch another one of those, so i kept itin my vault not bothering with it for sometime. \\n\\n\r\nBut after a long talk with a friend of mine i finally talked to him and well, i can definitely say that i do regret not watching this anime sooner. This anime in my opinion is very well written, compelling story. For the most part i really enjoy watching this series. There was time where it made me laugh, sad, angry, and just a whole bunch of emotions. This is one of the few animes that i can sit there and say that i felt something with this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as i love this anime, i can\u2019t go off and say that it has it flaws. One thing that bothers me about the anime was the lack of interest i lost in the middle of it. This anime at the beginning and at the end is grabber without a doubt, but something about the middle takes a dip in quality in the story. In my opinion, i think it\u2019s the fact that i this show does depend on subaru\u2019s ability \u201cReturn By Death\u201d to make certain plots interesting. This is a big part of the show, but the fact that that this one device has this big of a role in the show, it does have me question how this show would be if this device was completely removed from the show\\n\\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n\r\nwhen i first finished the series, i really thought that this group of characters were really good and one of the best i\u2019ve seen in anime. But after awhile my perspective of the characters have changed. Don\u2019t think that these characters are as amazing as i thought they were, but they definitely are pretty awesome characters. I love watching each one of them in the world, there interactions with each other and how they handle with situations, and yes they are fun to watch, but honestly not many of these characters i would consider iconic or memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe only two characters i can say that i would like from this show is Rem and Puck, mostly because these characters were really awesome in the show. I don\u2019t think there was ever a scene where that i didn\u2019t enjoy where Rem and Puck where one of the main characters of. Not to mention that they are some of the cutest characters in the show, \\n\\n\r\nOne character's trait that i really like is Subaru\u2019s descent to insanity. I really appreciate that they didn\u2019t just make him simple crying and worrying about has happened to him. Instead they make him visibly go insane. Because when you think about that, if someone was going through something so intense and crazy like that, there mental health would not be near stable. It definitely does make more relatable in some ways. And in ways he is as iconic, but in my mind he\u2019s iconic for the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing, one ultimate thing that made me upset about this character, it\u2019s about who he decided to be his love interest. I find it pretty ridiculous that Subaru would actually go and choose Emilia over Rem. i know that in the end it seemed as if Emilia was developing feeling for Subaru, yet Rem obviously had some overwhelming feelings for him. Not to mention that throughout the show, Rem seems to be a way more useful character than Emilia. Yeah sure Emilia has helped him at the beginning, but Rem has done some crazy shit, just for him. Regardless if it was for plot, i highly disagree with this choice.\\n\\n\\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\r\nMusic And Animation\\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\r\nAs far as the animation and music goes, There really isn\u2019t much to say. The animation has a really nice pallet of color that makes each scene really nice to look at. It makes binge watching this show a lot more easier while looking at really pretty scene. The music for the opening and closing scene are really good too. The first one has to be my favorite. I liked the second one to, but it definitely felt short of the mark as opposed to the first one\\n\\n\\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of this all i give this show a 8 out of 10. This show is definitely a show i would recommend to all. It\u2019s a show that you should experience. I would have given this show a higher rating if it wasn't for the choices the Subaru made and the lack of momentum in the middle of the show. But despite that i had a really fun time watching this. It\u2019s a great anime and if you are passing anime uo then i will say that you are missing out on something special. \\n",

            "content": "Let's not waste any time : this show is shit.  But why is it shit?  When i was watching, i thought that it could be one of two possibilities :\r\n1. Not unlike Apple with the iphone7, the creators were seeing just how bad of a product they could intentionally make, and still have people fall for it.\r\n2. The show was written by somebody no older than 15 who was trying really hard to look way smarter than he actually is.\r\nSo what's wrong with it?  I want to say everything, because there is no facet of this series that is well-executed.  Theepisodes follow a predictable structure : 20 minutes of slice of life, and then a CRAZY PLOT TWIST during the last two minutes.  This is because the protagonist goes back in time after dying.  So the idea is that he dies at the end in a very \"surprising\" way, and then you get to re-watch the same time period as he tries to change things in order to survive.  The concept isn't bad, there is potential here. But the execution is bad.  Bad.  In the lead-up to Subaru dying, it is just so tremendously boring. The amount of rambling and forced attempts at humor fall short of delivering any kind of entertainment what-so-ever.\\n\\n\r\nBut sometimes, during the non-twist part of the show, you get a break from the bad comedy and you get an action scene.  This is where it really tests your patience, because it's profoundly annoying, not just bad.  Whenever there's a combat scene, you get maybe 5 seconds of action, and then the characters pause to talk shit to each other, probably for a good minute.  Can you imagine a battle in medieval times, and after a few sword blows traded, both armies pause and start talking smack?  Sounds retarded?  It is.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, you've guessed it, are another huge problem.  There are a few of them that are decent and somewhat entertaining (Betty and Roswal), but the rest are abominations.  \\n\r\nThe protagonist never shuts up with his \"epic one liners\" that only a 13 year old could think are cool.  Emilia is a pure plot device whose personality entirely depends on the requirements of the current scene.  The maids are the most annoying though.  Rem goes from killing the protag in one timeline, to practically falling in love with him in the next, with just about no motivation for the change.  Protag went back in time about 3 days and through small changes in his actions, changed her actions completely!  Isn't that convenient.  B-but but the butterfly effect!  Nah.  This writing is so bad that it makes the latest season of Game Of Thrones look like pure brilliance.  Seriously, only a teenager could come up with this and think it's good.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest offender in the show is the sheer quantity of cliches.  It's not a few here and there.  It's everything.  Everything.  like 80% of it is copy-pasted from various other sources. \\n\\n\r\n\"push you out of the way of a car/stampede and get hit myself\" check\\n\r\n\"you pretend to do it for me but you're just selfish!\" check\\n\r\n\"protag says some deep line and girl starts smiling and tearing up as wind starts to blow in her hair\" check\\n\\n\r\nNothing in this show is genuine.  Nothing. \\n\\n\r\nSo now you'll ask me how in the world i made it to episode 13.  There is one thing that this show does well, and it's hook you with little doubts, cliffhangers, etc.  It really makes you believe that in the end there will be some sort of complexity to this story, if you hang-on long enough.  I never expected it to become good, but it's more like morbid curiosity.  \"How can they possibly explain this stupid thing, or will they just hope we forget about it?\".  The other thing that kept me going\\n\r\nis the prospect of writing a really bad review for it.  I wanted more material to complain about.  Now that i wrote it, i feel pretty good.  Was it worth it?  No.  \\n\\n\r\nBottom line is, if you've finished high school, don't even try watching this.  You might think you can watch it on 3-4 layers of irony (that's mostly what i did) and get some enjoyment out of it, but you probably won't.  \\n",

            "content": "Imagine getting suddenly thrown into a fantasy world. Would you be:\r\nA) shocked about the whole thing and desperately trying to survive and then find a way home, \r\nor\r\nB) cheerfully helping random girls and running into mortal danger like an action hero without any care?\r\nIf you answered B), then congrats, you just might be the protagonist of Re: Zero. Who would act like that, really? No actual human being. As a result, this guy is impossible to relate to. Whenever they try to make him seem more human, he always quickly reverts to his waifu-chasing heroics. Just listen to him:\r\n\"One good deed a day.\"\r\n\"My main heroineis an easy woman, huh!?\"\\n\r\n\"Men are about guts, and women are about beauty!\"\\n\r\n\"You get a front row seat to see the man you fell for become the most awesome hero ever!\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is the kind of dialogue where faces and palms meet.\\n\\n\r\nRe: Zero is a show where we have our \"I must save everyone; girls are cute and men are heroes\" protagonist facing off against the \"Mwahaha, I'm so crazy and psychotic and I like murdering people\" villains or, even worse, random unintelligent monsters. Black and white to the point of tedium. It's all meaningless, really. Whenever there are signs of moral ambiguity in the supporting cast, we are quickly convinced that they are good people at heart after all. We might get interesting characters then and we can't have that.\\n\\n\r\nThe author must have noticed how stale the script is, so he tried to wash it away with blood. And they failed. Re: Zero demonstrates that overflowing gore and surreal horror don't by themselves constitute interesting moral conflict. Yes, arms will fly off and heads will roll on a whim. Yes, there are otherwordly monsters and esoteric vistas with piles of corpses. This is all fine if you like bloodbath or surreal horror for the sake of itself, but if you are looking for meaningful moral struggle, the show can't deliver at all. I don't want to watch ten minutes of some bland douchebag ranting about how insane he is or how much he likes murdering people. And I certainly don't want to watch two episodes of fighting against a generic RPG monster.\\n\\n\r\nMeet Natsuki Subaru, alleged NEET and shutin (never demonstrated onscreen) and also a blank slate with no past or original thoughts to speak of. He has no wit, no charm, no decent lines. A large chunk of his screentime is spent delivering boring cliches about girls, dating and alleged feminine virtues. Now and then the show tries to be self-aware and lets him lampshade some tropes, but he only does it for the really obvious and boring ones.\\n\r\n\"Read between the lines a bit, will you!? It was supposed to be a classic scenario where I save a girl from hoodlums!\"\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, he is cast into a fantasy world and for some reason gets time travel powers, getting stuck into a time loop every time he dies. Which happens all the time because the whole world is out to get him and this guy has no sense of self-preservation in the first place. For him chasing girls takes precedence over finding a way home, discovery about this new world and even simple survival. In mortal danger he spends his time planning dates (or how to harass the girls, rather). Indeed, much of the show consists of the protagonist getting murdered in increasingly brutal and strange ways. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is really disappointing about the time travel is how much he has to rely not on smarts but action hero stunts, which he is somehow able to pull off, apparently because he works out sometimes. Seems legit. There are a few good moments here and there of Subaru getting more and more insane because of the time loops and the responses it draws from the other characters. It is then that he comes across as slightly human, but he'll go back to his heroics soon enough. How many times do we have to listen to cheesy speeches about bravery and selfless sacrifice? He even wants to save people who have tried to kill him. How much of a goody two shoes is this guy?\\n\\n\r\nThe show has him \"reform\" himself every few episodes, by which I don't mean he is questioning his motives or values in any substantial way. No, what happens is that he reconfirms his purpose in life, which is saving his waifus, and comes up with a better plan to get it done. Again. Well, at least he hasn't done his stupid poses with shaking his hips anymore, so there's that.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not like it would have been hard to come up with better goals for this guy. He could be an anti-hero or villain protagonist trying to get more fame and fortune for himself. Or how about improving local society and social conditions? The place sure would need it. But alas, in this show politics is little more than a plot device that occupies a few minutes. It's kind of silly, actually: politics would have offered countless excuses for war, riots and other potential massacres to satisfy the bloodthirsty viewers. But we can't have real social commentary; that would get in the way of joke-like villains and waifus.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast isn't much better. The main love interest Emilia is barely in the show, mostly standing in the background or more often offscreen. You'd think that a romance would require more, you know, interaction between the two characters. Her main personality trait is helping people in need. How original. There is also a collection of other waifus with awkward dialogue, usually involving Subaru harassing them in various ways. A few of the side characters have more interesting personalities, but out of them it is the boring ones who get the most screentime. We even get lengthy flashbacks of one guy's past when he was never interesting to begin with. Thanks.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also poor pacing. Too often, the episode consists of 20 minutes of filler and hanging out with waifus and 2 minutes of pointless gore and cliffhangers. Occasionally we get a full episode of pointless gore instead, but it isn't much of an improvement. Especially episodes 4 through 11 are very slow at moving the overall plot forward. There is some mystery surrounding Emilia, but in 25 episodes it got so little focus it might as well have not been there. Surely there would have been time to develop it if they had cut down some of the pointless fight scenes or hanging out with secondary waifus. You had 25 episodes, there's no excuse. Get on with it!\\n\\n\r\nNo amount of blood will wash away bad writing, and Re: Zero is proof of that.",

            "content": "TL:DR at the end.\r\n~Contains some spoilers~\r\n Now I'm nowhere near as good of a reviewer as some of the people on this site. I don't have a massive vocabulary and great sense of humour like ZephSilver, I'm not able to consistently write well with unique hooks over and over again like Stark700, and I certainly am not as experienced as the living legends like Archaeon, TheLlama and Veronin. So usually, when I look to write a review, I check theirs first. to look for things to include in mine. However, when I looked for their opinions, I was dismayed to see that none of themHAD one yet. (At least at the time of writing this. Please note the time of writing and submission date are different.) Because of this, I was able, for the first time in a long time, to form my very own opinion, with no influence from the ratings or anyone else. \\n\\n\r\n Unfortunately, Re:Zero quickly became the next SAO. The fanbase split drastically into two halves: those who loathe it and those who are convinced it is the second coming of Jesus, both of them providing wholly preposterous reasoning as to WHY they did. Honestly, at the core, they're both right, it's just that nobody can cooperate with each other and meet at the middleground. \\n\r\n____________________________________________________\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n What makes Re:Zero as popular as it is is the inclusion of two popular tropes in the industry, while still managing to make it feel fresh and innovative. At first, it seems like a standard 'Isekai' themed anime... until the brutal slaughter scene at the end of episode one. This is where I was hooked. No light novel adaptation so far had managed to surprise me in the slightest, up to now. I thoroughly enjoyed the world building and neural warfare for the first couple of episodes. I only had one minor complaint: it's so slow. I mean, REAAAAALLY slow for a portion of the series. Don't get me wrong, the climaxes were beyond compare,  but seeing traverse through the exact same setting with only minor changes was boring. This problem preceeded to bother me until the arc that kickstarted Re:'s popularly: Subaru's psychological breakdown. \\n\\n\r\n Emilia's rejection of Subaru, and his constant denial of help by other characters is fantastically executed. It emphasizes one of the central points of the series, and personally, my favorite part: Subaru may be the main character of the story, but the world isn't going to treat him that way. It's an element of realism that not many other series can pull off, never mind a LIGHT NOVEL adaptation. At this point, I had become an avid Re:Zero fan. I eagerly awaited the next episode and would watch it ASAP. However, by episode 17, I was worried. Subaru's torturing had gone from a legitimately depressing atmosphere to just torture porn. Any character who died would be alive by the next episode due to Subaru's constant rewinding. I had even become skeptical of the author's well being. Like seriously bro, stop killing my waifu. You got a gore fetish or something? And just when I thought my fondness had ended, when all hope had dissipated... Episode 18 aired. \\n\\n\r\n I don't care how much you despise the series, saying episode 18 was bad is just ignorant and immature. The confession of Rem, Subaru's characterization coming together, and just how realistically the romance was handled is something I don't think I've seen in any anime - ever. THIS was the climax. THIS was the turning point. Loving the series was no guilty pleasure to me anymore. I had a legitimate reason.\\n\\n\r\n It should have ended there. Once the main story is back on track and Subaru can actually make rational decisions (a surprise to all of us), the newly arranged allied force rallies and departed on a journey to defeat the white whale. I found this arc to be a bit boring, and maybe even cliche'd, something I'd been proud that the series had avoided. The next arc was the last of the current TV series, and my expectations were high; and alas, I was let down. The ending may try it's best to be climactic, but it can't disguise the fact that Subaru really didn't 'develop' as a character at all; he just went back to the way he used to be, and it doesn't change the fact that Re:Zero's story is nowhere near complete. \\n\r\n____________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n Not much to say here. The art and animation are both fine, they have standout moments but they also have terrible ones. The amount of positive moments outshine the negative ones, thus 6/10.\\n\r\n___________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n Re:Zero's soundtrack usually isn't mentioned when listing it's favorable aspects, which is really quite a shame. the first opening theme sounds like a traditional opening song to a light novel, having a couple standout moments where the song repeats itself to remind us of the show. Just because it's common though, doesn't make it bad. The first ending and second opening are really where the series shines though. Myth and Roid adjust to the tone of the series so well. They handle most of the insert songs as well, which are also fantastic. The second ending is also great and is probably my favorite of the four theme songs, it's a shame it doesn't get discussed as often. The voice acting is good, really good. Especially the characters of Subaru, Emilia, Rem, and Betelgeuse being the standouts. Most of the voices are rather average otherwise, but perhaps it's because the four listed get more screentime. The sound effects are also great. They can range from creepy to weird, and some will have you craving to hear them again and again. \\n\r\n_________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n Now this... THIS is the part where the fanbase is probably the most conflicted. And with good reason. Before that though, lets talk about designs. The designs that drove people away from the series in the first place. Subaru's design isn't very unique compared to the countless other 'isekai' protagonists. He's just your happy go lucky track suit protagonist with a funky hairstyle. Emilia is well designed, but not memorably designed. And the rest of the characters after that... aren't well designed OR memorably designed. Besides maybe Betelgeuse. Hard to forget that ugly mug. Personality-wise the characters aren't very unique either... but that brings me back to point 1. The characters are supposed to be bad, they're designed TO BE cliche'd. And the author puts an element of realism in each of their personalities to make them stand away from the archetype. I think it worked, a portion of the supporting characters, but not all of them (Looking at you, Wilhelm.). It wasn't all bad, though. Rem's confession was immensely different then an anime confession I've seen in the past, which goes to show how mature this author can write a character. So WHAT HAPPENED with Subaru?! At first, he begins like just about every other protagonist ever: 'Durr hurr I played video games, jokes about magic and me being the hero', and that was fine. At least then, he was likeable. Then the author torments him, turning him into a narcissistic prick who is utterly dissatisfactory to watch. Again though, this is all intentional. Subaru was still a decent character at this point. So what drove him to the bottom of the barrel in my eyes? The last quarter of the series was supposedly him after he had gotten over his psychological trauma, but honestly, there really isn't a noticeable change in him. He just reverted to what he used to be before the tormenting. That's not character development! If you reaaaaaaally wanted to stretch you could argue that Subaru has become more heroic, but the change is so slight I don't even think it matters.\\n\r\n_________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR\\n\\n\r\n+Innovative way of combining popular tropes\\n\r\n+Good worldbuilding\\n\r\n+Animation and Art have more positive than negative moments\\n\r\n+It sounds great all around\\n\r\n+Majority of the characters feel realistic, namely Rem and Emilia\\n\r\n-Slow paced\\n\r\n-Just torture porn for pieces of it\\n\r\n-Incomplete story\\n\r\n-Some of the characters (Namely Wilhelm) are just bland\\n\r\n-Subaru's development feels fake\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh and I almost forgot\\n\r\n+Re:tards. This is the funniest insult to come out of the anime community I've ever seen. I just wish I came up with it first! Bravo forums, bravo.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu isn't the messiah the fans praise it as. But it's not a complete garbage pile like the haters would like you to believe either. With the massive popularity and controversy of the show, you can sure as hell expect a season two to be right around the corner, and who knows... maybe it'll get better, maybe it'll get worse. \\n\\n\r\nSee you in a couple years, Re:tards.\\n",

How is it possible this anime fails at every single thing it tries to incorporate in such a terrible way?\r\nWhat is RE:Zero? what is what this anime tries to be? at the start of episode 1 i got the feeling this anime was a parody, it's clearly conscious of the Isekai genre clich\u00e9s yet this anime ends up doing later exactly what itjust mentioned moments ago, i don't understand, am i supposed to find that funny? am i supposed to find the retarded behavior of the MC funny? people find characters with chameleonic personality are considered cool these days? you can feel your brain cells dying at an incredible speed while watching this anime and their characters interacting.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's ok, Re:zero is not a parody or a comedy anime, that's fine, is this a romance anime then? No, the special ability our main character has leaves no room to the development of the other characters or their relationships ergo the character chemistry is terrible and inorganic, only a retarded teenager who has no idea how real human relationships work will think this romance is well done.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's ok? This is not a parody or a romance anime, is this some senseless action series then, like Gurren Lagann or Kill la Kill? Nope, this series takes itself waaaaaaay too seriously, it's way too edgy, it's impossible to say this anime is just pure and senseless action, so it fails again here, if this is not enough for you then let me mention that the battle sequences doesn't make any sense at all either, i want this review to be spoiler free but if i have to put an example i'd say watch ep. 3 if you have more than 4 completely functional brain cells you'll notice what i'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nSo ok, this is not a parody, a romance anime or an action series, is this a psychological thriller then? all the characters are extremely simple, as generic as they can be, in this wonderful anime you'll find: the maid lolis, generic waifus who love our beta MC for no good reason, traps, furries, drill lolis, that other thing... you know that thing with the green hair, the uni-dimensional psycho, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe audiovisuals are not even good either, the colour palette is a extremely poor choice, the music is ok but it's forgettable and character design is as generic as the personality of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWe have another pathetic and generic Isekai anime, just another Konosuba, Overlord, Mondaiji-tachi, SAO, No Game No Life, etc.... don't waste even 20 seconds of your time in this insult to the humankind.",

            "content": "In a classroom of Isekai anime, Re:zero would be the edgy kid who screams \"F*ck the man\" while having no idea what its talking about.\r\nAh, yes, Re:zero.\r\n\"Read the source, it explains everything!\" They said.\r\n\"Subaru totally grows and matures and is realistic!\" They said.\r\n\"You just hate him because you like Gary-stu!\" They said.\r\nYou know what, I read the WN even further than you LN fanboys so I can criticize Re:zero all I want. \r\nStory - 2\r\nRe:zero starts with a boy named Subaru transported to another world then death, suffering and screaming happens. You see the fanboys like to pretend there is this cool mystery about whyhe got transported or who the witch of envy is and how the stake is totally high cause the world might end.\\n\\n\r\nBut it doesn't really matter, you see Re:zero uses the classic style of shitty mystery called \"making the character retarded and never ask the crucial questions\" such as Subaru never ask how he got transported or how his power works. \\n\\n\r\n\"It is a deconstruction of Isekai work, huh dun dun, those characters never ask, huh dun dun\". Then you are not being realistic are you? score 1 for hypocrisy, just to rub salt in the world, a lot do ask. So Re:zero is merely deconstructing a straw man it created in its head.\\n\\n\r\nWhy does Subaru act like a hot-head moron? \"It deconstructs the shounen like protagonist, huh dun dun.\" Ignoring that a lot of the shounen like protagonist actually fight pretty smart and knows what they are doing.\\n\\n\r\nWhy does the other characters never talks regularly? \"Because this is a deep mystery and there are conspiracy's and stuff, huh dun dun.\" Which they immediately start explaining when the protagonist is about to loop, so Realistic.\\n\\n\r\nWhy does the evil witch cult characters act like rejected Danganropa characters? \"Cause that is what scary crazy villains act like, huh dun dun!\" So scary, guess that's why I was in tears laughing. I guess Hannibal lector, Yohan and all the other villains are total failures compared to the magnificent Re:zero.\\n\\n\r\nAnd these pretty much is where Re:zero's plot fails, it tries to hide its generic \"girl world guy\" plot behind the excuse of \"deconstruction\" and \"mystery\" yet it fails to understand the very thing it is talking about. Isekai stories have a lot of varieties, everything Re:zero does had been done and made better in other places. On its own it is a shitty mystery, cause magic, there is no logic behind it, in fact if I sum up the answer to the mystery from even the later arcs it is summed up as \"The Witches did it!\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2\\n\\n\r\nSubaru is the creation of an author who is up his own ass, about how he is amazing for going against the common flow. And this is true, you can actually find interviews or replies from the author anytime someone criticize him for creating an unlikable protagonist.\\n\\n\r\n\"No no, I meant to do that.\" Yeah, you purposely created garbage, good job.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the fanboys defending Subaru is realistic or would grow, allow me to let you in on a little secret.\\n\\n\r\nYou know how he whines and push the blame onto everyone else, act like a prick, and never thinks before charging into something?\\n\\n\r\nThat never goes away, ever.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact he gets a character reset every arc, which goes, loop - bullshit happens - whine - loop - breakdown and scream at people helping him - loop - miraculously solve things because of luck - reset character arc.\\n\\n\r\nSo tell me, how can a man that never grows be realistic?\\n\\n\r\n\"You're just a hater, why you read/watch it if you hate it so much. You just don't understand.\"\\n\\n\r\nBeyond Subaru the amazingly emo MC, the other characters are not that good as well, since time loop, there is basically no consistent growth. Especially Emilia whose characteristics never moves past the \"nice lonely love interest\", I literally cannot think of another word to her personality, she is blank.\\n\\n\r\nRem and Ram have a bit of character, but Rem suffers from character rewrite as she is in love with the MC to an unbelievable extent. And they get toss on to a bus anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOthers doesn't matter, they appear, they leave, leaving no long lasting impact as the story doesn't revolve around them.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Sound - wasted\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3\\n\r\nGarbage torture edgelord material, if Akame ga kill and stein's gate had a baby, this would be that. And on the quality side, this definitely approaches akame ga kill's horribleness more.",

            "content": "REUPLOADED: Because mods are fair, objective and professional. It's not like this deletion was completly unjustifed and I got rude talking down to despite not breaking any rules. Nope, everything's fine with mal.\r\nFormulaic in the worst ways possible.\r\n(spoilers included)\r\nThere are five aspects of the design responsible for the excessive popularity:\r\n1) Hammer approach, overloading shock value way beyond what public is used to.\r\n2) Artificial suspense, overloading gimmicks to maintain the tension constantly no matter what. Bait cliffhangers among the most annoying ones.\r\n3) Standing out by counter trend, take what's currently overused in the recent seasons and do the opposite, disregarding whether it makes sense or not,eg edginess levels, protagonist strangely aloof attitude in dangerous situations.\\n\r\n4) Standing out by exaggeration, everything that isn't \"original\" make bigger and louder into epic proportions. Especially visible with the mc ridiculous behaviors and gesticulations and over-the-top villains.\\n\r\n5) Otaku aimed pandering, part of the reason for cringy inhuman behaviors of the mc.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's that foundation that make this show unbearable. Let's analyze each aspect in detail.\\n\\n\r\nEasy choice for a protagonist is the shouneny noisy determinator. Save the girl, tantrums every 10 minutes, underdog etc. What's not easy is how to make this grossly overused trope overshadow already existing classics. Actually it's easy - do the same thing but much bigger. More obnoxious and overbearing. Shout more, make more cringy remarks, more mannerisms and gesticulations, make him stand out no matter what it takes, every scene, every moment, stupid behavior all the time, CRANK-IT-UP! It's that simple.\\n\\n\r\nThere seems to be a global trend for gratuitous shock value these days. Maybe the media have been overusing it to the point where the public is too numb? Whatever the reason the show hits the bulls eye with it's bountiful torture fetishes. It might've been partially excused if it served the plot or allowed character growth, or at least give us some nice action scenes, but no. The time travel aspect is completely worthless. Mc doesn't learn from mistakes, doesn't try to change the future outcomes. And no, playing house maid or working on his harem interests doesn't serve any purpose other than pandering. Learning about basic limitations of the ability on his own, gathering knowledge, experimenting and implementing strategies is essential for creating suspense in a time travel oriented theme. Instead he freaking walks into the same alley with bandits every time knowing the outcome. Only purpose of tt is allowing constant deaths for the mc without the need of replacing the lead. Remember Dokuro-chan? That's the same idea, only here we're supposed to treat it seriously. PI-PIRU-PI!\\n\\n\r\nThose initial episodes? A false hope for epic time travel fueled battles. Nope, forget it. Moe harem sol with plenty of edginess.\\n\\n\r\nOne solution to lack of interesting ideas for story is the ancient ninja art of plot dilution. That is, to stretch out as much as possible providing as little info as possible, and only provide sprinkles of a mystery to keep the attention. Like in the early mansion arc where each episode is filled with many minutes of moe harem that introduces nothing of value to the plot, and then in the ending the story is moved ahead by a few centimeters, plus a dramatic cliffhanger. Just enough excitement so you don't quit, but next time all the build up is disintegrated, nothing's advanced and repeat the cycle. Bait and repeat. It's prevalent to the level that there's a even a curse that prevents mc sharing information just to stall the plot. Ugh.\\n\\n\r\nSupposedly there'll be an info dump on the ability in the later arcs but that just defeats the idea. The whole point of a mystery is to steadily explore it. The show doesn't do that and no amount text blocks is going fix this colossal flaw.\\n\\n\r\nOne important point about the design formula is the inevitability of contrived drama. Episodes need to be suspenseful whether it makes sense or not, otherwise there's a risk of loosing the viewer. Easy way to create tension is the device known as idiot plot - that is drama created by unbelievably stupid choices. If mc didn't walk straight into his doom there would be no excuse for more torture porn or harem episodes where he tries to placate flail wielding maniacs. If he actually investigated the real mystery that would advance the plot and remove excuse for pandering, so yes he needs to be dumb. If Blue/Red tried to confirm their flimsy suspicions about mc there wouldn't be another gruesome scene of internal organs becoming external. This is beyond bad writing, this is a natural consequence of the design.\\n\\n\r\nThe single moment where the formulaic design is easy to spot is the scuffle at the election. On the outside the actions of the mc are illogical and immature, but from the design perspective every single point of the incident was necessary. He's present there because there wouldn't be any drama if he acted like a reasonable person and stayed at home. He needed to step out and make a scene in public because a shouneny mc always challenges problems head on, tact is overrated. He needed to shout like a brat and insult various institutions because foiiit the powaaah appeal (and Furry did the same in the very same episode, oh for the love of Wave Existence...). He needed to defend the girls good name because that's a codified response, and the fact that he's only hurting her good name and going against her wishes both is irrelevant. He accepts the duel he has no chance of winning because underdog appeal, and determinator can never surrender when doing the right thing, even though he's doing a horrible wrong thing to his harem interest. He's following his design to the letter, but because it crams too much everything collapses upon itself and all it leads to is nonsensical cringe.\\n\\n\r\nMotivations that don't make sense are closely tied to this issue. We're talking about combining mutually exclusive traits that while individually are appealing to the audience, put together contradict each other. At one point Albino calls out the mc on his selfishness, that he caused chaos for her sake is a lie. The answer he gives doesn't make an ounce of sense. How could it? None of his behaviors do, including putting his life on the line for a random girl he just met. At this point the formula imploded upon it's unsolvable contradiction, all you can do is sweep it under the rug. And funnily enough the magical hands of plot stalling intervene, problem solved.\\n\\n\r\nThe reasons why comedic aspects grind with the serious tone also originate at the same source. Show tries to be everything at the same time ignoring the need of coherence and that's easy to sense. The completely unnecessary otaku demeanor just adds more to the problem, talking about waifus and \"tan\" suffix while facing supposedly dramatic situations is so unnatural it destroys suspension of disbelief. It's because so many pieces are thrown together into the pot is that nothing works together. An incoherent Frankenstein that defies all reason, so badly convoluted that at some point mc character development is skipped and simply replaced by a different person wielding the same face. Little wonder since salvaging that mess is an impossibility.\\n\\n\r\nGimmicks are much easier then writing something actually interesting, empty suspense being the key phrase. Suddenly stating the next death will be final because dunno, and then revives no problem. Mc smells of the wicked witch, how ominous. Except nothing ever gets explained and the issue is swept under the rug as an occasional plot device. Throw something in the air to make it sound exciting and forget about it and move on to next gimmick. Boring and lazy. Those bait cliffhangers were pretty bad, but the worst example is killing off a useless side char to show this is \"serious\" and \"people can die permanently\". I lol because because SnK did THE EXACT SAME THING. They killed off a single side-char to create an illusion of tension and no one important has ever died again. No, nameless redshirts don't count. Redshirts that have nothing beside a name neither. Cheap as hell. Fact that it isn't even permanent because reset makes it even cheaper.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're wondering why I haven't mentioned other characters, that's because there aren't any. There's harem fodder in the colors of the rainbow, cutesy mascots, talking plot devices, one dimensional villains. Names are wasted on them. Oh and the circus clown - it's baffling that the answer to lack of interesting character design is to draw it as bizzare as possible. Standing out from the rest is a live or die for this show.\\n\\n\r\nSummarizing, it's clear that the popularity winning formula is the very reason why the show is so atrociously bad. With such an incoherent cluster of incompatible motives and nonsense after nonsense weaved into contrived drama there's no room to relate or empathize. Everything about it is unnatural, especially in the character department and once you understand the reasons why, each cheap technique or gratuitous shock shovel only serves to put you off even more. It's past the point of lack of writing skill, this is the area of complete lack of effort. Not merely making errors but piling them up more and faster hoping some of it'll click with the audience. An approach like this deserves nothing but scorn.",

            "content": "This review contains massive spoilers. I've decided to write it in a way that I am not holding anything back and thus spoilers are unavoidable. \r\nRe:Zero. Possibly the most popular anime in 2016, everyone is talking about it. Its rating on MAL was pretty high that I recalled it reaching 8.80+ during its peak. For an average anime fan like myself, it'd be hard to not catch up with the latest anime trends and find out what's all the buzz about... eh?\r\nTo put it simply, after finishing this show, I could not comprehend the praise surrounding it. Perhaps it's not my type, as they say,tastes differ from one another. But rating it a 3? It's fair to say that I am one of those who joined in the hate bandwagon of Re:Zero, which I would not deny, for I do hate the show to a point that I was dragging myself to finish it.\\n\\n\r\nThe purpose of this review is to point out what I disliked about the show, I do not expect everyone to agree with me, that's for sure, but I felt compelled to write this whole thing, most of it is to satisfy my own amusement.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest critique on this part, is how the show lacked two very vital things: Identity and atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with identity. What is Re:Zero supposed to portray? Our protagonist Subaru got transported into a fantasy world with no reason explained whatsoever in the entirety of the show. Okay so at the very least it ticked the \"fantasy\" genre, I will give it that.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the time travel genre was one of the most hip thing in 2016. Erased had it, ReLife had it, Orange had it, and Re:Zero also had it. Our friend Subaru apparently has the ability to perform time loops! But how does he activate it? By dying. He knows! What does this remind you of? That's right, a video game! He has the ability to load his previous data in predetermined save points! But it is way too farfetched to categorize this into the \"game\" genre just because of this, seeing this is merely my own made up point in how I see the entire time looping gimmick is presented in the show. Subaru didn't exactly enter a game, he entered a realistic fantasy world where to him, everything is real.\\n\\n\r\nSo what's the point of Subaru dying? To solve mysteries! To solve problems! His beloved Emilia is in danger, his friends are in danger, the entire village is in danger, the entire kingdom is in danger! He must save them all! For he is the only one blessed with such a powerful power that he was allowed multiple chances to undo the calamity and save the world! No worries if he fails, he can simply die and retry! Due to this, whatever mystery is only a matter of time for Subaru to solve. There is no time limit, which effectively eliminates every tension of the show. Oh there is suspense, it's to see how Subaru solves this heroically, having to wait week in and week out for that as it airs, I can imagine the suspense among the viewers. As such, trying to catch up with this anime and marathon it, like I did, is truly a bad idea. This is a show where buying the DVDs and Blu-Rays loses its appeal and suspense since you can just marathon the whole thing and see how Subaru pulled everything together. \"Mystery\" I'd also slash out from the genre.\\n\\n\r\nNext up, \"dark\", oh the thing that captures the hearts of many fans of Re:Zero. The blood splatters! The severing of limbs! The removal of head, squashing it! Ooh! A must watch for every fans of gore and violence! While everything I mentioned in the past statement did indeed occur at some point of the show, the problem lies in how they were presented. Due to the fact that Subaru has the power to reset time, every bad outcome that was inflicted onto his friends could easily be undone simply by having him die. Where is the shock value in that? Oh Rem died, Emilia died, everyone died, so what? They will be back soon, Subaru will definitely die to make them come back. Due to this, I find it hard to feel any sadness nor pity onto our perpetually dying friends of Re:Zero, and I felt better laughing off at their ridiculous dying manner, like how I used to watch Another. \\n\\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be a limit to Subaru's ability as well, other than he will suffer some mental stress, and a sinister feeling that something is grabbing his very heart, threatening to crush it whenever he tries to reveal his time looping ability. This so-called sinister feeling is supposedly the Witch's curse which was placed onto him and granted him the time to loop time, and he can't tell anyone for he felt he's gonna die if he spilled the beans, but towards the end he was able to abuse this and never seem to have any dire consequences aside from minor panting and yelling \"I MADE IT OUT!\". No tension, no suspense. \\n\\n\r\n\"Psychological\", the genre threw in mostly because of Subaru's personal issues he must tackle because of this overwhelming power he had. He is the only one with the ability to undergo character development, for there is no reason for the others to develop, seeing they might get reseted anytime soon. At one point Subaru was intoxicated by the shock of seeing many of his friends dying and he was totally in a slump for a while, but then, with no other choice to move the plot forward, he was immediately cured of this psychological shock with barely nothing to explain the cure behind it. It's standard shounen stuff, main dude is good, until he goes down and turns emo, then come back up even stronger. It's not necessarily bad writing, but the way Subaru regains his self simply by witnessing Rem dying for the nth time is pretty hard to digest on. Is the genre well explored here? Nay. \\n\\n\r\n\"Comedy\", the thing that ruined the entire dark atmosphere that Re:Zero was emphasizing for 2/3 of the show. For the comedy to work in a dark show, it must not hinder the overall atmosphere that hangs around the show. If you went overboard with them, I do not know what to feel about the show anymore, am I supposed to immerse myself into the brooding nature of the show? Or am I supposed to relax myself and let the comedy soothe me? Which is it? With everyone dying all over the place, suddenly we have a cat-eared trap who wears a sexy dress and purring nyaa nyaa all over the place. When Subaru was mercilessly captured by Peltugese and has his hands chained and his emotions temporarily scarred, we see our evil villain dancing around like a clown, grabbing his poor head as he shakes with excitement \"MY HEAD TREMBLES!!!\"... err what? So is this supposed to be a tragedy... or a comedy? Another anime that comes to mind which suffers the exact same issue is Akame ga Kill, in which Bulat, one of the allies of the main dude, tells him how miserable it is to be one of them, \"we must kill in order to survive in this cruel world\", right that's deep and dark indeed, but then the next scene he strips down to show his muscles and said \"I AM ALSO GAYYYY\"... err what? Indeed. Comedy must be used appropriately, if it's a comedy-driven show, then let it flaunt itself be. If it's a dark show where comedy is used to lighten up the mood a little, then it must not be excessive and overshadow the dominant dark mood, good examples of how it's done well would be Rurouni Kenshin, Hellsing Ultimate, FMA:B or the more recent ERASED.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about \"romance\" and \"harem\"? Almost non-existent. Yes, most of the driving force that pushes Subaru to do most of the things he does in the show was motivated by his unwavering love for Emilia, who just happens to be the first one to help him, then after that his target is fixed and no other girl matters. Poor Rem had no chance despite dedicated an entire episode telling how much she loves Subaru, only for him to reject her with the infamous \"But I love Emilia.\" Oh too bad, Rem. \\n\\n\r\nThen again, what makes Rem so popular? She had been appearing everywhere in anime sites and fan arts are multiplying faster than mushrooms. After watching the show, I finally knew. There's no competition at all! Her screen time was at least 5 times more than any other female character, which really makes me question the reason why Emilia was listed as a main character while Rem the supporting cast in the MAL page of this show. She was the one that Subaru will first see whenever he revives (during the third and longest arc), giving her tons of screentime to endear fans with. Harem? No competition at all, Subaru loves Emilia. Romance? But Emilia hardly appears in the show! What romance?\\n\\n\r\nSo now we have come down to this, what identity does Re:Zero has? Is it dark? Not really due to the heavy comedic tones. A comedy then? Nope too miserable with many people dying. A mystery? Just wait for Subaru to die enough times, there's no rush. A psychological thriller? Hardly justified. Time travel? Mostly a gimmick. Romance and harem? No thanks. If anything, only \"fantasy\" qualifies as the only identity of Re:Zero. And the atmosphere? Like I said earlier, it's neither dark nor comedic, it's wishy-washy and does not know what it wants to be. \\n\\n\r\nHell, even in the end, I could argue and say that there is no plot in the show. After 25 episodes of suffering and restarting and solving mysteries, everything seems unchanged. Some say there are currently 12 volumes of LN and the anime only adapted the first three. But if you failed to tell us the point of the story in 25 episodes, it's a failure.\\n\\n\r\nPRESENTATION (ART & SOUND):\\n\\n\r\nThe show is colorful when it's peaceful, gloomy when shit happens. It's okay here. The fight scenes are fine, but nothing extraordinary. I liked the quick camera shifts during the fight between Reinhard and Elsa, but after that nothing like it returns, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices are indeed done well, the seiyuus putting their best effort to the characters they voice. OST wise it's pretty okay too. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nWe have Subaru, whose name I often joked myself for a car, is a self-proclaimed otaku, a NEET who spends most of his time at home. Yet he has a grip strength of 70kg, claims to do sufficient exercises in his room that I won't be surprised if he can take down a Taekwondo black belt, and his reflexes are much above average. Had it not be the other characters in this fantasy world being too powerful, he would be among one of the candidates participating in the Olympics, I won't be too surprised. \\n\\n\r\nWhile his knowledge of the otaku culture was pretty justified and highlighted several times in the show, beyond that he is more of a Gary Stu, minus combat abilities. He is a smooth talker, every girl he meets will like him at some point, he is good with kids, he is brave and fearless, he'd die to save his loved ones, he is able to discuss political issues with the supposed candidates of the throne, to a point they had no objections and followed all of his suggestions, he is able to boost the morale of troops with actions alone, he is truly the perfect man many could dream about. Oh sure, he is flawed, he is often beaten to a pulp, he always suffer psychologically because of his time looping power, he further suffers so because no one would understand why he would know many information that others don't, simply because he could experience it, die, and live to tell the tale. And yes, at times, he had the plot armor simply because it's not the time for him to die yet, most notably during the Moby Dick sequence, everyone dies except him whereas he was the one charging first into it. What? Subaru is at best, a totally fictional character that doesn't have a shred of realism in him.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have Emilia, for unknown reasons yet revealed to us, she is one of the two half-elves of the show, the other one being Satella the Jealous Witch which everybody in the world of Re:Zero hates on. Since she looks so similar to Satella, her hair, her ear, everything looks so similar, she is hated by the public, but for mad reasons only Roswaal knows, she is also one of the candidates to be the ruler of the kingdom. Gawd, please leave the poor girl alone, everyone knows she stands no chance in democracy. Beyond that, she is immeasurably sweet, her kindness knows no bounds, despite her super important emblem which gives her the right to be a candidate of the next ruler being stolen, she wouldn't mind waiting for hours beside a stranger (Subaru) whom she had just met to recover and wake up. She is also a beauty, with perfect body proportions, and she also knows magic and fights well. The perfect waifu material. Does it remind you of someone? Yes it does. Asuna from Sword Art Online. She is the embodiment of the main girl that has to be created so perfectly so that the fans have a new waifu to worship on. \\n\\n\r\nBut fans of Re:Zero don't really worship Emilia, it's Rem!! How so?? Like I mentioned earlier, Rem had no competition in the show, as she had at least 5 times more screentime than any other female character of the show, probably more. What is Rem? She's a petite cute little maid, who has a twin (Ram) who is pitifully no chance to rival her twin sister's popularity. She is great at chores, and she is strong! For she is an oni! Ooh! And her boobs are pretty big! Double ooh!! The even more perfect waifu! And they gave her a tragic backstory to boot!! Triple ooh!!! It is mandatory to worship her as the new anime goddess, or the mob of Re:Zero fans will swallow you whole. Come on, it's painfully obvious that the showmakers are also getting high at Rem, that she was continuously allowed to shine no matter what. Ugh.\\n\\n\r\nI had to point out this character for I had the biggest problems on him throughout the show. Felix Argail. For heaven's sake, what's the reasoning behind his creation? He is a brilliant healer, the best we know, and it's a good thing, for whenever everyone's liable to die everywhere easily, we do need someone to heal effectively and quickly to ease the suffering of people. Here's the problem, his design. Allow me to put it simply. He is a male, who has a feminine look, a feminine voice, speaks like a female, and dresses like a female, and has cat ears, and speaks nyaa nyaa every time!! What is that? More stuff to satisfy the otaku fetishes? We already had Gary Stu, perfect waifu, even perfect maido, and now nyaa trap?? Oh lord, what is becoming of our world now? A trap doesn't have to act like one, like how Nagisa in Assassination Classroom doesn't actively seek out female dresses to wear and actually acts like a boy, as we know there exists of feminine looking guys in the real world. But... but... Felix is... beyond my comprehension, truly.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is the other obnoxious character I could not tolerate in the show. It's our main villain of the season, Peltugese!! Do you know the phrase \"evil for the sake of being evil\"? He is one evil bastard alright, and to make him stand out, he has various quirks, let's see... \"MY HEAD TREMBLESSSSSS\", while dancing and with the most noxious of voices he repeated preaches about how sinful Subaru is for being slothful and doing nothing (while being chained), as well as not saving Rem when she was being slaughtered (he was still being chained), blablabla. SUBARASHIIIIIIII oh gawd no, please stop and die already, thanks. A good villain has to be someone who does enough to credit him/her to be a villain everyone hates, for Game of Thrones viewers, they should be familiar, as how the villains there got numerous accolades for best villain awards. Or to look closer in the anime world, Griffith of Berserk. But Peltugese? My head trembles every time he tries so hard to justify his evilness by preaching how someone can be slothful (for whatever reason, even looking at him in the eye, he will say \"oh those slothful eyes!!!\") and dancing like a maniac, as well as having no bones and ligaments that his body parts can twist around like rubberman. What?\\n\\n\r\nThe comical designs of the characters in the show makes it difficult to take things seriously. Roswaal truly looks like a clown, the same manner why I detested Mephisto in Blue Exorcist. Beatrice, although probably the only good character in the show that I liked, is a kuu-yandere loli magician. The two beast howlers that assist Subaru by emitting powerful howling waves, are wolf riding loli twins. Rem is a petite maid with big boobs, reminiscent of someone? That's right, Hestia, minus the maid part. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nIf you made it all the way here, I thank you, for this is truly one of the longest reviews (and ranting) that I've ever wrote. It should be obvious at this point now how much I detested the show. Truly sorry, but Re:Zero was not the show for me. I was constantly annoyed by the way the story was told, was constantly annoyed by the ridiculous characters, and was constantly annoyed by the incomprehensible rave behind the show. \\n\\n\r\nAn opinion is an opinion. I tried my best to wrote one, and this is what it became. If anything, I must praise Re:Zero for making me writing such a lengthy rant. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 3/10 Poor. \\n",

            "content": "Re zero is probably the biggest show this year with some people already putting it in their top 10 fav of all time..personally to me i enjoyed the show but i dont think its top 10 of all time material here's why:\r\nLets talk about the good parts of the show first :\r\nThe characters are fantastic with each character having its own personality unique story and motive etc (subaru being my favorite character of the show)\r\nThe sound design and voice acting in this show are superb i can't stress how well the soundtrack fits it....everytime you think all is ok this sudden music starts building upand adds the suspense and the feeling of unease (i highly recommend buying this show's ost) the OP and ED theme are all great OP 1 being my favorite OP of the show \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was spectacular in this show, some of the most well animated scenes i have seen in a while , the directing of the show was also on point and the pacing never felt slow.\\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about some of my problems with the show : \\n\r\nsubaru in particular , subaru is a unique MC to say the least and its hard not to like him because you can relate to him in so many ways but i can't help but feel frustrated at him some times \\n\r\ni at one point got so frustrated with subaru that at one episode i paused it and kept it  paused for like 10 minutes trying to figure out if subaru really said what he just said or did what he just did ( i love subaru's character but i gotta admit he can be pretty douchy some times to the point where i wish i was there to punch some sense into him) i cant tell you how many times i was like : \"really subaru ? really ? \"\\n\\n\r\nalso subaru's motive was never clear , from the start of the series he is thrown to this magical fantasy world and he doesn't seem surprised at all if anything he looks happy wish is kind of weird and feels just like a plot device for the sake of getting subaru in there (it might be explained in season 2 if we ever get one who know ? ) \\n\\n\r\nsomething that also bugged me was some important characters not getting enough explanation as to why they are doing the stuff they are doing for what purpose ? is it just for the sake of being like that ? (characters like beetlguise and satella ) \\n\\n\r\nAll in all Re zero is a great show nonetheless that you should definitely watch if you are a sucker for psychological thrillers/ time travel anime .",

            "content": "Before we get into the core of the review, let me say that Re:zero surprise me a lot, my first mindset when i'm interested in watching this anime is that this anime is going to be a good but cheesy romance fantasy anime with the main plot center around the relationship between all the female lead with the main protagonist. While there's some elements about that, the main overall plot is deeper than that and there's surprisingly a lot of epic battle in it. Soo, is it live up to the hype ?? I will tell you all about it.\r\nThe plot is to be honest,kinda hit and miss, the plot lines consist of something like this, the main character found a mystery or a problem that he has to solve, he failed a couple of times to solve it, and after 2-3 episodes of trying to piece together a solution, by some mysterious power known as the power of determination, friendship, and a lot.. a lot.. of luck, he managed to solves it. Nearly all the plot lines can be solved this way, while the first time he found a mystery or a problem part is really great and thrilling, you will question youself whats up with  mystery, why does the problem keep happening and stuff like that, when he finally able to solve it you will think, \"Thats it? All this build up for that?\". While this \"luck\" could happen once or twice in an anime plot but when the situation when from \"Ohh my god !! Everyone is dead ! Ohh nooo !!!\" to \"Well, we just solve this without anyone dying, great !\" in an episode, its really discouraging in the end. They even did this in the ending, it makes all those build up seems wasted. \\n\\n\r\nThe main problem from this anime is that there's a lot of plot holes, from the unexplained villain motive that the anime seems to have forgotten about it after 10 episodes or so to some sinister smile to what it seems to be a \"good guy\" It is unbelievable. While i do get it that this anime is from Light novel that wasn't finished at the time when this anime is released, but the way they tease it is just annoying. Don't give away too many small plotholes if you cannot answer it in the end. In the end of this anime while i get the answer of some of the main mystery, there still more than 10 plotholes that didn't get answered.\\n\\n\r\nLike i said before, the solution to the problem in the ending is one of the smoothess problem solving so far in this anime, it really makes all that effort to get to that point useless. While i dislike the problem solving, the romance scene ending is golden, to be frank all the romance scene is golden in this anime, its sweet, beautiful, and charming, all of that is thanks to the great character development.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime surprisingly stand out from the other is the character development, nearly all the main characters has their own personality and its all beautifully told either from the interaction with the main protagonist or from stories told through flashback, they all has their own goal, motive, and personalites that makes them unique and the personality is not just \"She is evil or she is a tsundere.\" There isn't a truly nice person in this anime and the main protagonist need to prove that he is worthy of someone respect and kindness. It is a shame that the main protagonist character development is hit and miss, on some scene he is really realistic, so realistic that the anime give about 2 episodes with him stressed out because of his power, but again on the other hand he is suddenly brave because the situation demanded to, this inconsistency its what makes me cannot like the main protagonist completely.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is one of the best, nearly all the female lead has a good reason to like the main protagonist and the anime explain it well why they like him, even the conflict is explain well in the end. This anime also has one of the greatest confession scene in the anime that i have ever watched. When i watch the confession scene, its soo beautiful and cute that i want to punch a wall, its that good.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall action scene is quite decent, some of it is really epic and cool, like the first battle scene that is really awesome, not the best out there but good enough to make my jaw drop. While the other action scene is decent enough but not that great and epic, its just either ended to quickly or not really great because of one sides outskilled the other. Overall, im quite happy with the action scene. The visual for it is really satisfying to watched also, because of how they didn't afraid of using blood to spice up the battle, its really adds up to the action scene.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the background art and character design is okay, the music is really great, its really adds up to the whole mood, like when the main protagonist is facing danger or when the romance scene happened, its really help in building up the mood, its successfully guided the audience towards a certain mood and that is the point of the background music.\\n\\n\r\nSoo, is it good ?? I must say yes, its not a masterpiece by any stretch of your imagination. But it is enjoyable enough to satisfied your time. Watch for the character development, the romance and the action scene and you will not be disappointed.",

            "content": "Great another horrible anime with a immature and salty fan base. I went into this anime with fairly high expectations however it turned out to be a huge disappointment. This show was getting so much hype that decided to jump on in and see what all of the fuss was about, but in the end I was bamboozled into watching this trash.\r\nSTORY- the story in re zero is pretty much non existent. We've seen this trope millions of times a teenage boy wakes up in a fantasy world with no knowledge of how or why he's there and he just accepts it. Why is hehere ? How did he get here? I mean a little explaining would be nice and I have to say this to particular part reminds me of Erased an anime I enjoyed a lot. From what I saw in the12 episodes of Re Zero I watched they barely focus on world building and the environment. However I will give this anime credit for being funny. The first episode was just hilarious especially the scene where saburu is being stomped by a guy group of generic street thugs. Saburus power was pretty interesting and reminded me of a video game. Everytime he dies he respawns to the being of his arrival to this new world. \\n\\n\r\nThe show simply doesn't know what it wants to be, at one point it's extremely dark and next it's goofy and comedic. I just couldn't sit through more than twelve episodes of this trash if you can't pull me in during the first 12 episodes then  it's simply not worth my time. Yes fanboys I dropped your precious show.\\n\\n\r\nSound - the theme song was great but everything else was average \\n\\n\r\nArt-Average \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- All the characters are extremely shallow and boring. None of them develope at all and they all follow every character archetype in anime. Saburu is a normal teenager who apparently has the skills to hold his own against a trained serial killer assassin and his smooth way with words makes the ladies panties melt. The only and I mean the only two good characters in this anime is the talking cat Puck and Reinhard the pretty boy swordsman.  As I said before if you haven't been able to develop the plot and characters in half of the damn show then it's a waste of my time. And why do people keep comparing this to Erased( just finished it)? I'm not a fan boy , but they're two entirely different shows and aren't alike at all lol All in all I found this anime to be a complete waste of my time. I give it a RIP.\\n\\n\r\nRest\\n\r\nIn\\n\r\nPiss",

            "content": "Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu ( Starting Life in Another World )\r\nIt all happens so suddenly. The main character is one day pulled into another world via a summoning spell by the most ancient and devious character in all the realm. The main fellow, Subaru, is caught up and dumbfounded by this strange transition and is forced to understand the new world that he lives within by encountering a plethora of thieves, babes, knights, and assassins.  The painstakingly terrible part of this whole anime is that the main character is subject to dying until the ancient witch grants him the favor of saving hisprogress, thus meaning that he doesn't start at day 1 again once he dies.  What wonders will he find and can he accomplish his self-righteous mission?\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest part of this anime is that the main character is intensely passionate about being a hero, and is put through trial after trial of complex, complicated situations. In fact, it is the fact that he wants to be a hero so terribly bad that this is his greatest fault. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of the anime is that the ancient witch, which is an important part of Subaru's life in the new realm, requires a more in-depth explanation of her powers and reason behind her actions. \\n\\n\r\nBoom! So there is it. The best and worst parts of the anime. Are you happy, now? Probably not, since there is more to explain and we haven't even gotten into the juicy stuff, yet.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: It is possible that you may shed tears during at least one of the episodes here.  Be prepared for intense character emotion followed by very sad music and characters actually crying in the anime.  But who knows. You may be bulletproof.\\n\\n\r\nThe genre of the anime bases itself on action, mystery, comedy, and romanticism. If you have a love for dragons, wisps, bestial humanoids, and other mystical entities + humans than this anime might be for you. \\n\\n\r\nAh, yes. And one more thing. This anime features an astounding amount of bloodshed and gore, so don't close your eyes. Everyone has to grow up someday. \\n\\n\r\nOn to the ratings:\\n\r\nStory - 7 - Because the main character is so incredibly determined to accomplish his goals, I will give the story line a higher rating than otherwise. The anime leaves many holes at the end. None that are cringing or aggravating, but enough that the wrap up wasn't complete.\\n\r\nGraphics - 10 - Full ten points for the graphics. The developers here went over and above to create very graphic scenes as well as combine graphic engines where ever applicable. This is very noticeable, as certain objects are injected with detailed animations and colouring while others are not.\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 10 - Very cool. The scenes were given more colour due to the fun and interesting soundtrack. Some many not notice, but this was done very subtly and properly.\\n\r\nCharacter personas - 10 - The main character was incredibly flawed and imperfect, however he carried great passion and strength of will. The side characters served their purpose and were kind of cool to understand. A good job was done explaining side character's backgrounds. I can appreciate that kind of stuff.  Annnnd the bad guys were insane.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nRecommended - Yes. Worthy of a good watch, and the cliff hangers might leave you wanting more at the end of each episode.",

Lets go through all the characters in this harem. We have THREE Lolis and two of them have maid uniforms who are annoying and dull, a crazy green-haired pyschopath, tsunderes, a neko boy like wtf and one of the worst male main characters I have ever seen, bland, boring and annoying that is Subaru.\r\nSo apparently at the start of this series he came from the real world and into the fantasy world of this anime and they never explained how thathappened, Nothing was even logical or made any sense, if any of us got dumped there we would be trying to find a way to get back but not Subaru, never gave that a thought. Then he decides to be in charge of the damn place and he decided to save everyone and gets obsessed with this girl called Satella. \\n\\n\r\nThen without reason he started to get killed over and over again and come back to life at a time skip point because why not. Then in the second half of the anime he stops dying and he spends his time rejecting a loli who fell in love with him, killing whale sharks because apparently they are dangerous and chasing that crazy green-haired psychopath. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole anime was all over the place and does not making any logical sense. I watched this because it had the psychological genre and instead I get an overrated, overhyped loli-filled piece of shit of an anime. If you like watching trainwrecks and have an obsession with cliches then this show is for you.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Returning from a convenience store late at night, Natsuki Subaru (Kobayashi Yuusuke) blinks to find himself inexplicably standing in the middle of a busy street in a fantasy world. Enthusiastic about this incredible development, Subaru is quickly beaten to a pulp by some back alley thugs before being rescued by a mysterious girl (Takahashi Rie) chasing after a thief and her prized possession. After agreeing to help the girl search for her stolen property and touring around town, Subaru eventually comes to find where the girl\u2019s trinket has been taken however, upon attempting to retrieve it,both of them are assassinated. Suddenly Subaru finds himself standing back in the street where he arrived, discovering that he has gained the ability \u2018Return by Death\u2019 allowing him to rewind time by dying and change his and the girl\u2019s ultimate fate.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nAs opposed to most light-novel-esque, dropped into a fantasy type shows where the story primarily revolves around a relatively identifiable protagonist, the enigmatic and attractive girl he first meets, and a reasonably large cast of purely supporting characters, Re:Zero presents something a bit more complex. Like most of Re:Zero, the setup is remarkably similar however how everything ultimately plays out is fundamentally different. Natsuki Subaru aside, the number of the cast members are fairly one-dimensional but this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Their personalities and more importantly their dialogues are quite entertaining and add a lot of value and distinction to the show\u2019s large cast despite their straightforward designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe character most important to talk about here as he is both absolutely integral to understanding what Re:Zero is about and is one of the most heatedly criticized characters to emerge in the last couple years, is Nastsuki Subaru himself. Unlike the other characters who appeal to their audience through their interactions with Subaru rather than their own personal intricacies, Subaru features a very weighty and meaningful character arc. Upon arriving in the fantasy world, he possesses all the hyper stereotypical traits that one has come to associate with his archetype. He was a shut-in gamer who\u2019s genre savviness leads him to expect certain things from the world and look forward to his own heroic feats and adventures though he is quickly disappointed in this regard. He gives off this kind of reckless, 4th-wall-breaking abandonment in how he addresses other people which in some ways is endearing and provides a good sense of camaraderie between him and the characters he converses with.\\n\\n\r\n With this mindset come a few complications, the most important of which is his blatant white-knight mentality \u2013 where someone grounds their self-importance in helping or saving others they deem requiring their aid. It\u2019s a common character trope that is strongly tied to Subaru\u2019s archetypal design as the protagonist however its where the show goes with these initial traits and how it perverts and subverts them that Subaru\u2019s characterization becomes interesting. His personality spurs him to often make shallow, ill-informed decisions and rather then everything falling neatly at his feet despite his inadequacies, he pays for his ignorance and nearsightedness constantly and often in horrific ways. \\n\\n\r\nThis drives a lot of people to hate Subaru and subsequently hate the show but his development is approached very purposefully. Re:Zero, for a time, wants you to hate Subaru. It challenges the wish-fulfilling otaku to self-insert with him. The show isn\u2019t afraid to paint Subaru in an unflattering light in order to provide development and commentary and this is a huge part of what sets Subaru apart from other protagonists. What\u2019s more is how his experiences effect him. In a world where he effectively cannot die and the only thing that carries over are his recollections and sensations, the mental stress from the agony of death and of having his memories invalidated places an immense psychological toll on him.\\n\\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t just make poor decisions because of his shoddy ideologies and self-perception but because his priorities and values are warped by his own pain, fear, and trauma. He has to cope with a lot of horrible experiences and these things very clearly influence who he is at each step of his journey. Ultimately one\u2019s own enjoyment of Subaru and probably of Re:Zero itself will depend upon how well they think the show justifies his characterization. He can either be extremely compelling and subversive, or a total turn-off.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: \\n\\n\r\nWhile Re:Zero\u2019s visuals aren\u2019t the most crisp at times, it does have plenty of instances of good animation and if anything can be generally agreed upon it\u2019s that the show has an excellent production. The character designs are distinct and memorable and really lend themselves to this fantasy world that Subaru has stumped into. There are a few CG demi-humans that populate the background of the city whenever the characters visit but beyond that the show is pretty aesthetically consistent and looks pretty good all throughout.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s impressive is the show\u2019s attention to visual detail, often attempting to trick the viewer, highlight certain elements of a shot, and even unveil a sequence of events in a very cinematic way. While Re:Zero has fewer action scenes than one might expect from its premise and design, when they do roll around they are exciting to watch and at times even possess surprisingly inventive choreography. While the show\u2019s visuals aren\u2019t extravagant, I would cite them as a considerable strength of the show if only because of their intricate focuses and production value.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: \\n\\n\r\nAs evidenced by the premise, the story of Re:Zero starts out very quickly and abruptly \u2013 Subaru simply closing his eyes before he is transported to another world. It\u2019s a nice way to skip the pleasantries and dive right into things. We know everything we need to know about Subaru at the time based on his actions in the convenience store and his reaction to arriving in the fantasy world. He starts out his journey in the same way any game-savvy protagonist would. He gathers information, tests certain things like currency and language and wonders where the cute girl is who summoned him before lamenting his own ordinariness and lack of magic abilities. The early episodes are pretty dialogue driven which sets the tone of the show pretty well. Some of the most important aspects of the show are how Subaru forms relationships with other characters and this dialogue-heavy approach both offers compelling character interaction and sets the show up to be something else entirely later.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the story and the characters that populate it are an additional appeal of the show. The world presents its own lore and landscape which lends to the fantasy elements of the show but also to its foreshadowing and many narrative mysteries. There\u2019s a great deal of world-building minutiae as well which adds a lot to the story though at times can feel too openly expository. Many of the characters as they are introduced are fairly stereotypical to go in-line with the kind of \u2018false-premise\u2019 of the show however a number of them develop over the course of the story into more complicated, distinct, and memorable characters. The dialogue in particular is especially engaging.\\n\\n\r\nIn much the same way that discussing Subaru is necessary to understand the characters of the show, discussing his ability to reset his experiences after dying is equally essential to understanding the plot of the show. How does Re:Zero make a show interesting when its first episode teaches the viewer that Subaru is only ever one misstep away from starting all over again? How does the show maintain its engaging qualities for long periods of time when the viewer can\u2019t forget that they are only one reset away from all of what\u2019s happened meaning nothing. Within the premise of the story, there are only two things that carry over after Subaru\u2019s death \u2013 the knowledge from his experiences and their psychological toll on him. Re:Zero correctly places its emphasis on this.\\n\\n\r\nBy establishing early on that the protagonist can die and die repeatedly, \u2018Return by death\u2019 becomes an engaging storytelling concept by effectively illustrating that everyone is constantly hovering right above death. Normally the narrative or plot would dictate whether a character lived or died \u2013 aptly named plot armor, but the show upends this dynamic by resetting the story in dramatic twists which allows it to do anything it wants with its characters. It\u2019s engaging and a strong use of the show\u2019s premise. When things are at ease, there is an inescapable tension to the proceedings. The viewer is taught to fear for the worst when things look dire but it\u2019s when victory seems assured and everything is going well that the show becomes the most unsettling. That is when you should be most worried. It conditions you to never trust a scene in how it progresses and only those of the greatest importance shine through the misery and gloom.\\n\\n\r\nThough Re:Zero is initially bright and adventurous and returns to that tone with varying frequency, it also becomes grim beyond measure. The schism between what has happened before and what is currently happening in the show creates a discomfort for the viewer which speaks directly to Subaru\u2019s own feelings on a more distant scale. The show really beats Subaru down until a point of absolute misery, despair, and horror which some viewers may view as gratuitous and unwarranted yet it\u2019s certainly grim and thrilling. Between the constant cliff-hanger endings the fear that Subaru might die and all his effort amount to nothing, there is an ominous apprehension to the show. It\u2019s a story about determination, resolve, and development \u2013 of how Subaru copes with his self-perception, psychological trauma, and attempts to form relationships with other people, all set against a detailed fantasy world and plot. It sells you a stereotypical, tired, and unapologetically run-of-the-mill setup before gradually transforming into an exciting fantasy thriller that sets itself apart.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]: \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was great. Much like some of the show\u2019s visual sequences, the music at times possessed a very cinematic feel to it. The tracks were enjoyable and highly varied. The music really embodied the various tones of the show phenomenally well \u2013 the sorrow, the pain, the grand scale of the story, the adventure and drama. Re:Zero had a very effective and memorable sound track that doubtlessly aided in the show\u2019s great presentation of its story.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Re:Zero has proved to be one of the most contentious shows of the past several years surrounded by some of the most volatile of opinions. It would seem that one\u2019s enjoyment of it will depend heavily on what the individual viewer brings to the show. Personally I thought that it was an exceedingly enjoyable show that repurpsosed and breathed new life into what has become an incredibly tired and troublesome genre. It managed to incorporate new twisted and provocative elements while not losing sight of what made the style of story it\u2019s playing off of fun and enjoyable in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8\\n\\n\r\nI gave Re:Zero an 8 because it was a highly entertaining fantasy thriller with a lot of great dialogue, fun characters, and an engaging world. Subaru\u2019s character arch and the way in which \u2018Return by Death\u2019 affected the narrative were both very captivating and the story presented plenty of action and adventure to stay just as exciting as it was dark and grim.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]: \\n\\n\r\nAnybody looking for a solid high-fantasy, dramatic, action thriller ought to find that Re:Zero delivers on all the elements they are looking for in excess. For those who have grown tired of the typical, parallel world story \u2013 Re:Zero may offer them some insightful reprieve or double-down on why they dislike the genre in the first place. It\u2019s reception seems extremely case-by-case and so I recommend that any prospective viewers just head right into it and personally see if its the right show for them.",

            "content": "You have probably heard of this anime. At least a few times. Yes. The popularity level is pretty high. However, it is pretty rare for one such show to deserve its popularity, for this is amazing. Wa- OH CRAP, WRECKING BA-\r\nOh crap, what happened. Huh? Why am I back where I last slept. OH, NOT AGAIN!!!\r\nSo, the story is about a guy named Subaru (not a car) who one day ends up in a strange, fantasy world. Kinda like a video ga- adventure. However, whenever he dies, he goes back to his last checkpoint. Honestly, with this gimmick of him going back whenever he dies,the plot can be pretty slow at times but despite this, remains entertaining. No time is wasted in this anime. Every moment has a purpose, whether its developing Subarus character, or some other thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are the only big problems in this anime. Well, honestly, the art is usually pretty good, and the charater design is great. However, there are many frames that are poorly drawn or just feel off. Not only that, but the show does occasionally rely on CG (for example, the lizard things they all ride), and the CG is pretty awful. The animation is a mixed bag. Some movements are very fluid and well paced, whereas others are very stiff and just don't look so great.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a major plus. The soundtrack gives off a creepy feeling and never feels out of place. The voice actors, while in Japanese, did a great job at portraying their characters's emotions. Especially Subaru and Betelgeuse. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, what really makes re zero as amazing as it is, are its characters. Subaru is not what you think. At first you think he is just another clich\u00e9d protagonist who is full of himself, when, as the show goes on, you start to realize he really hates himself and has never felt accomplished. This kind of twist is quite rare in shows nowadays. Rem, too, got amazing development and pulled a complete 180. Betelgeuse, while not really getting any development, was probably my favorite character however, because of just how insane he is. However, at the same time, I love to HATE Betelgeuse, as he is just a flat out mental clown with a Justin Bieber haircut. Unfortunately, most of the other characters lacked in development or screentime, but then again, the only characters who rlly needed development besides rem and Subaru are Emilia, Ram, and Betty. However, if a season 2 comes out, these issues could easily be fixed.\\n\\n\r\nI had an absolute blast watching re zero. Definetly my anime of the year so far. However, its not perfect, as the art and animation could use some work, and many things arel unresolved. However, if they come out with a season 2 (which I'm sure they will), these problems could easily be fixed.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, if any of this interests you, go watch the series right now. Do not hesitate. However, if you don't want to think (as the story is quite complicated) or you don't like blood and gore, then you will most likely not enjoy this anime as much. Overall, my recommendation is to watch this asap.\\n\\n\\n\r\nA \"Praise it\" rating\\n\\n\r\n9.999998/10",

            "content": "Re:Zero aims to be a very accurate adaptation of its popular light novels, with the animators seemingly willing to devote entire episodes to delivering all the most crucial moments in at least some detail, even if it brings the pacing to a halt to do so (one episode is basically a 20 minute emotional breakdown conversation, word for word from the novel). In other words, for better or worse, they tried to get as much of the story and as many popular bits from the source material to the screen.\r\nThey accomplished this, even if some very minor subplots and encounters didn't make the cut. Theshow decided to end before the novel's rather grievous cliffhanger epilogue, which presumably is resolved in the newest book coming out soon. (Interesting to note, the billboards advertising the book's release are hailing it as \"the TV anime's sequel\", essentially a confirmation that no S2 is planned.)\\n\\n\r\nThe first issue of Re:Zero is, this is a story that knows it will continue past these events and sets up many things, important plot points and such, for future resolution in future novels. But we only get 25 episodes, so a lot of these loose ends are not addressed again. Characters are introduced but couldn't be fit into the later episodes, like Elsa, Reinhardt, or Felt. Otto's introduction is a montage of Subaru having fun and making a new friend in the city, but there was no time to properly show it. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, no one suffers more from the show's bizarre pacing than poor Emilia. \\n\\n\r\nEmilia is a character; she is there. She's the primary motivator of our protagonist. That is about all one could say about her after watching the anime. Her personality is inconsistent (and never very engaging), her motives as a Candidate for Royal Selection are extremely unclear, and she disappears from the show for long periods of time. Her biggest moments are pretty much at the beginning and the end, and in between she sits in a mansion doing paperwork and being utterly clueless about anything going on. (Poor Betty also ends up this way, since plot rules say she can't leave the mansion.) Emilia's familiar Puck also does most of the talking when Emilia is present. Puck is cute, but she often steals the spotlight during Subaru and Emilia's few scenes together.\\n\\n\r\nEvery second Subaru is apart from Emilia, he is thinking about her, talking about her, or trying to involve himself in her affairs some more. But we never get any real attachment to her, and the few interesting moments that hint at her secrets, are never brought up again or explained. They imply that Emilia must go through \"Ordeals\" to become ruler, but that's all they do. Imply. We never see Emilia herself do a single thing besides occasionally fire icicles at cultists. So if you go into this show because you really like Emilia or her design, I'm sorry to say you just don't see much of her at all til the latter half. After the first few episodes, Emilia is reduced to a cameo at best until endgame.\\n\\n\r\nThrough a bait and switch, we're given Rem, the actual heroine of this anime, to accompany Subaru instead for a substantial chunk of the series. \\n\\n\r\nRem is...... she's a waifu maid. There's no way around it; she was clearly written to be one, which I suppose is the author's way of messing with fans by having this constant, unbearable sexual tension between Rem and Subaru that will never go anywhere. Subaru simultaneously worships his love for Emilia while relying on the cute Oni maid Rem the entire show for moral and emotional support, which she unconditionally gives him. Again, they expect you to read the web novels, which have various spinoffs and 'what if' stories to expand on the things it only hints at in the anime, like a Rem/Subaru ending. But without any context, it might come off as the show just blueballing Subaru, and the viewer by extension.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the animation. There are some absolutely gorgeous episodes in this show. The quality fluctuates occasionally, but there are no hugely noticeable cut corners. Magic is flashy, swordfights are swift, cursed magic is ethereal. Characters are lively and animated. Its best moments are when emphasis is put on the character faces, which are often very expressive and emotional. Many scenes are 1:1 visual adaptations of pages from the books and manga. Soundtrack has some really stand out tracks as well. \\n\\n\r\nI liked the experience of watching it, I liked the constant cliffhangers leading into the next episode, and I liked the main cast. The story has a very addictive quality that makes you eager for more. It's just a shame so much exposition and many crucial plot elements are only found in the manga and books. \\n\\n\r\nStill, I recommend it for the character interactions and the great protagonist.",

            "content": "Excessive focus on Subaru, maids and Emilia, while leaving behind the supposedly more impact and bigger scale of background story behind, drags down this show, leading to a quite disappointing for experienced users. In short, too much characters focus than background story focus, leading to unbalance dimensions. \r\nStory: 6 (doesn\u2019t put effort of transforming generic story into more special and different story)\r\nArt and motion pictures: 8\r\nSound: 7 (I\u2019m anchoring to a more unique and interesting OST sounds like in Digimon Tamers, Death Parade, etc)\r\nCharacters: 9 (I\u2019m not solely looking at Subaru. I\u2019m looking at other interesting characters also to be more systematic)\r\nEnjoyment: 7\r\nOverall: 7\r\n=============\r\nStory: \r\nLet\u2019smake analogy to make it imaginable\u2026\\n\r\nSuppose the maximal distance or landscape area of this show that is reachable by a car is 100km area. With a car that has super engine parts, its capability and potential should be maximized until it fully reached and explored 100km area. Unfortunately, this show doesn\u2019t do in that way. Specifically, although it does put a maximum effort, the show only puts an effort of running the engine until it reached 50km distance. The residual of 50km area ahead is unexplored. There should be more interesting and a great deal of story-telling on regarding the background story involving the fantasy and magical world (In order to be spoiler-free, I need to stop further story elaboration here). This implies that merely maximizing effort won\u2019t allow you to get maximum result in narrow space area unless you utilize 100% of your potential and capability with bigger scale and wider space area. For experienced and unbiased users who have more exposure of watching thousands of anime shows, this gap is easily spotted. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nTheir characters overexplain the conflict they deal with, in fact they often are consciously evoking their existential crisis verbally and excessively. Re:Zero treat the themes of broken MC in a totally dramatic situation with a mental commentary, thumbs up for voice actor, but in a similar fashion or repeatable way.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetic element:\\n\\n\r\nSo why then, despite negative story presented above, I scored 7 (Good anime) instead of lower? Aside from good art, lightning, and animation, this anime is intense. Intense in terms of characters and interaction among them. It\u2019s full of emotions from MC. It\u2019s packed with despair and gore scenes of having to suffer from death again and again. It burns your heart. It triggers your gut feelings to work intensely. So I\u2019m slightly biased to this dimension as, I think, it\u2019s quite rare to see anime with real intense expression of human emotions out there in the market. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, as you can see from my review, although this show is not balance, focusing on dimension beyond story-driven alone can entertain you more than enough during your weekend days. Imagine what would happen if this dimension is bundled with exploring MORE of the darker whole of story of this fantasy and magical world and MORE of the intense actions? \\n",
