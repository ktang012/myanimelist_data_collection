            "content": "All of us have seen that one series or show or book that didn't seem to know which direction in which it was going. Noragami, however, manages to pull off all of its elements perfectly without even batting an eye. Keep in mind that this is my first review so anything I\u2019m about to say may be incredibly biased or just inexperienced as a whole. With that said, let\u2019s begin.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story of Noragami begins with Hiyori: an average high school girl who has a fated encounter with Yato, a homeless god, but we'll get to them later. Hiyori, being the angel of a personshe is, pushes Yato out of the way of an incoming bus when he suddenly runs into traffic. This results in not only an accident and her being taken to the hospital, but from then on she gains the somewhat troublesome habit of losing her physical body and taking on a similar form, but travels around as her soul seperated from her body. Deciding she can't live on like this, she begs Yato and pays him in advance to restore her back to her original form, and thus, the two connect and Hiyori is abruptly introduced to the world outside of our reality.\\n\r\nAt least, that's what the show would have you believe from its broad overarching plot.\\n\r\nNoragami consists of several plot lines that all mesh in beautifully with each other both in terms of pacing and execution. It wastes no time in moving the story forward, save some of Yato's comic relief and character introductions here and there. It even has some realistic darker undertones thrown in smoothly. They make sure you understand the weight of loneliness and just how invisible those who are not of the living can be, how painful it is to be forgotten and wanting to be remembered. Having read the majority of the manga so far, the anime followed it quite well, had it not been for the filler arc that took up the remaining 3-4 episodes. But for the most part, I enjoyed the story very much and hope that it will follow the manga if it were to receive a second season, which is HIGHLY FAVORABLE. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason why I love the characters of Noragami is not only how diverse they all are, but it seems to have a Hiromu Arakawa feel to it; no character is used solely for fanservice or comic relief in spite of their first appearance. Every person in this series is well fleshed-out, developed, and not one-dimensional in the slightest, though that's what you may get the impression of in early episodes. \\n\r\nYato, our main character, is somewhat of an underdog aside from being homeless and having a strange fashion sense. He is definitely the real propeller of the show, providing us with not only mystery, insight, and of course, more comic relief than you can shake a stick at, but just such a fun time watching him in general. There wasn\u2019t a moment I didn\u2019t appreciate his presence on my screen. What\u2019s not to like about a bratty, teenage looking god taking up job requests for only 5 Yen? Much about him is still to be revealed, though they\u2019ve given us enough to go on for right now. His viewpoints on humans and life as a whole is somewhat irritating yet fascinating due to his experience of both and naturally, having lived for thousands of years as a vicious war god who has somehow faded to an insanely silly and docile version of that is still unkown. But to end his profile, Yato is a great character who differs from the typical shonen hero who still has plenty of development to go and is an amazing joy to watch at any given time. And personally, my favorite character of the series, so bias warning there.\\n\r\nNext up is Hiyori. I definitely don\u2019t have as much to say here, as she is a pretty bland character until she meets Yato and gets caught up in the world of gods and evil spirits. Before that she is just the average high school student who goes to school with her friends, has a loving and rich family, and is just normal overall. Her most defining trait is without a doubt, her extreme levels of kindness that most female protagonists seem to ooze with these days (hence the reason why she pushed a complete stranger out of the way of an oncoming bus because she\u2019s a female and therefore is /just /that /nice.) But of course, she isn\u2019t simply that customary for no given reason. Her main purpose is to serve as more of a window into the hidden reality we see that is so different from our daily lives, since she lives the everyday life that most of us do either as well or similarly to a fair extent. She reflects more of the confusion and shock the average human being would feel upon having a million revelations thrown into her face via Yato, and I suppose if you really don\u2019t care for her she could be more of a wish-fulfillment character into an alternate universe. Unlike other leading characters, she\u2019s determined and knows when to take the initiative when the situation is tight. But alas, she starts out as the badass female lead and then ends up getting damseled like some million-dollar-prize in the last couple episodes, which I hate with the burning passion of a million suns. But moving on. \\n\r\nLast of the main three is Yukine, Yato\u2019s sarcastic, stubborn fourteen-year-old Regalia who serves as his weapon for 98% of the show and also adds some more comic relief to (but mainly against) our poor underdog god. Out of those already mentioned above, he undeniably undergoes the most drastic character development in the entire show and /all of it/ is so, so, so satisfying. It surprises me how much hate he gets from the fandom, though not only is that a) more personal bias, b) not the time to bring this up in a review, and c) a time to complain about the fandom giving him crap, but I thought all of it was well justified, mainly because it is so simple to see what it is he wants, where he\u2019s coming from, why he wants all these things that he can never have. Plus he actually acts similarly to how an actual fourteen-year-old boy with raging hormones and inner angst would. The show finally starts to get into a rhythm of a plot with his introduction, which is majorly important as well. The only complaint that I would have is that I felt that the episodes just took a /little/ too long having the buildup to his extremely Paramount conclusion, though it was so intensely satisfying in the end that I completely forgot about it. It added a sense of desperation to the entire thing, which, when I think about it, is not necessarily a bad factor now. But of course, since he is a part of this show, he is a brilliant and extremely adorable character to watch if you can understand him, which should not really be a problem at all. \\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast is also great, each to their own with their own stories, pasts, and different sides, but are all also incredibly fun to watch as they give the show so much colour and variety. The only reason why I wouldn\u2019t give the character aspect a full-on 10 is because of Yato\u2019s rather-late-introduced arch-nemesis from thousands of years ago (who just happens to be a filler character because of the unfortunately short length of this series right now) and Hiyori\u2019s demotion of \u201cPrize to Be Won After We Win Because we Love Her\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI definitely don\u2019t have any complaints here. For the most part the animation style is typical Bones fare, with the art looking approvingly alike to that of the manga\u2019s. Each character design is bright and interesting to the eye, from Yato\u2019s cat-like blue eyes and strange scarf to the brighter colours of the giggly Kofuku and the other personified gods. Scenery is also well done and detailed, though I wish there were more fight scenes included because this is where the animation /really/ shines through. (Yato\u2019s Rend attack in particular, and mainly since this little cut is re-used multiple times in each episode.) Naturally there are times when the quality would dip here and there, but it does its job and doesn\u2019t fail to please. Solid 8 here. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Noragami was composed by Taku Iwasaki, the genius who had previously created OSTS for the famous Black Butler and Soul Eater, both of which were known for their very prominent themes varying from rock ballads and pop to Victorian-era themes. Most of the music is light-hearted and a bit repetitive in its loops, but it sets the mood extremely well and never feels out of place. It occasionally mixes in a few classical Japanese themes into it too, and that never feels unnatural either. The battle music is the main point in this entire OST along with a few other tracks that will make you go, \u201cOh, this played when ______ happened and it sounded awesome!\u201d because honestly it is just that great. No complaints. \\n\r\nAs if it could possibly add onto the already existing 10, the voice acting of Noragami is simply SUPERB and there is no other way I can say it. The casting of the actual god Kamiya Hiroshi as Yato was an absolutely perfect choice that would be practically impossible to imitate by anyone else. I wasn\u2019t used to hearing him play such a wide range in a single role, but I have faith in that man. I got used to it, and he was simply amazing. In fact, even if I didn\u2019t have any interest in Noragami\u2019s story I would still watch this anime just because this guy is present in the cast. I don\u2019t even think I need to mention Yuki Kaji, but I will anyway just for the fact that he pulls of Yukine\u2019s pre-teen angst and personality so intensely well that I almost burst out sobbing the second he spoke a single line. Both of them are really what pull off the characters and that goes for the rest of the cast too. Having seiyuu regulars such as Sawashiro Miyuki, Fukuyama Jun, and Daisuke Ono were all great choices as well, and again, no complaints at ALL. Don\u2019t even talk to me about the OP and ED. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Final Verdict: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, even though I\u2019d like to call it as such, Noragami is not perfect, as is anything else out there. But though it has its problems, I was never once bored or dissatisfied with this show to a large extent. The only thing that would make this bump up to a ten would be the confirmation of more to come. Though the anime had its happy (if not rushed) ending, there is still so much manga content to be animated, including the /incredible/ arc focusing on Bishamon, Yato\u2019s other arch-nemesis from centuries ago, but now\u2019s not the time to mention that. Noragami is a great blend of comedy and the supernatural, a character-driven show that really gets you to feel and has a tone that tends to capture. Beneath it all are underlying tones of darkness and grief, but still manages to put on a lighthearted tone when it needs to. But all in all, I had a great time watching the ride and grew attached to it. This anime will most definitely have a little reserved corner in my heart as one of the greatest animes of the Winter 2014 season and I\u2019m looking forward to the possibility of a future season. And with that, I leave you. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cMay our fates intertwine.\u201d \\n\\n",

            "content": "I, like most everyone on this planet, like things.\r\nThe things that I like come in many different shapes and sizes. One such thing that I like is the Winter 2014 show Noragami, a 'feels' shounen brought to you by Studio Bones, that brings together elements of shows like Soul Eater and Rurouni Kenshin to give you a 'family-centric' journey exploring what it means to be alive. \r\nOr rather I wish it did. At its best you've got tear jerking moments of mortality, family, and the struggles of existence. You have a cast of characters you care about, the voice acting encapsulating each character almost perfectly,flowing between emotions and the changing tone beautifully. At its worse you have long 'bouts of 'struggle of the week'. Slow buildup to something with mediocre story telling until the conclusion. And foreshadowing that is either so obvious it hurts, or massively fascinating and never really answered.\\n\\n\r\nThis show's strengths are in its characters, mainly Yato - who consistently brings out the best interactions of the entire show, be it his sweetness or his harshness - and are the primary reason that I want more and more of Noragami. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the cast are all better than average. Certainly better than what I expect from a battle shounen. And when the show is being a harsh drama I am utterly entranced, fulfilled and cathartic.\\n\\n\r\nBut. When it is not being amazing. It is mediocre beyond belief. Slow pacing, which ,whilst forwarding the overall plot, could easily have been something else more in line with the show at its best. This is further exemplified by the animation quality which just seems disappointing. The art style deserves better than what it got. The art style on its solid and certain 'Phantoms' (The primary antagonistic beings for most of the series) just ooze awesome. Others look about as cool as a blue frog can look. And whilst I couldn't call the animation terrible, for the most part it does nothing good, the creepiness is not exemplified, the sadness is not exemplified, the little details are simply absent. I'm never impressed and at my worse I'm disappointed by how often the shounen \u201cPower up to kill shit\u201d is copy and pasted. Sure it is cool the first couple of times, but with the amount it is reused it loses its power quickly. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack takes some interesting steps. Using more electronic and dubsteppy tracks than your standard rocky shounen. I personally found it kind of bland, but I can easily see others enjoying it far more as the tracks are not out of place and certainly match the moods of the scenes. Being unique in this regard should be applauded, but whether it really works or not is something we can question heavily.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the biggest and most substantial flaw of this show is where the overall plot goes. This is a 12 episode series that does not buckle down and focus. Most of what fascinated me in the earlier episodes was not really built upon. Instead I have a Kenshin-esque fight scene and a re-establishment of the strange 'friend-family-esque' trio, which was only broken up an episode earlier. I want more exploration of Yato and Yukine's character depth and backstory. I want my weird romance subplot between a kinda human and a deity. I want the three main plot lines to be resolved. \\n\\n\r\nBut I don't have that. Instead I'm left here waiting and hoping for a season two that takes everything amazing about this show and continues, without the flaws of the first season. Which in itself is an issue, because the ending track is completely and utterly gorgeous. Easily amongst one of the best EDs, based on track alone, that I have had the fortune to listen to in my lifetime. But a single music track alone is not something most people will watch a show for.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Lacking both recognition and a shrine, Yato (Kamiya, Hiroshi) is a god down on his luck, forced to take on mundane requests in order to earn his meager offerings. On one of these menial tasks he is rescued from the path of a racing truck by Iki Hiyori (Uchida, Maaya) who subsequently is subjected to inconvenient out of body experiences when her soul leaves her body. After Hiyori requests for Yato to fix her condition they meet Yukine, (Kaji, Yuuki) a wandering spirit who becomes Yato\u2019s divine weapon. The three fight ayakashi and do odd jobsin order for Yato to one day become a recognizable god with both a shrine and followers.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nNoragami has a fairly small cast which can be nice in terms of simplicity however it can also lead to the show feeling over-reliant on only a few characters. Yato, the penniless god who dreams of becoming a well-respected deity, is a fairly lighthearted and comedic character however is perfectly capable of becoming serious given the proper conditions. He\u2019s not afraid to take on simple jobs in order to earn his 5-yen donations however I also felt that this trait was somewhat troublesome as the character has high aspirations but only progresses towards them at a snails pace.\\n\\n\r\nIki Hiyori is a generic enough school girl (outside of her interest in professional martial-arts). She isn't a very intricate or even interesting character however her place in the show is well situated enough as she acts as a sort of layman for the viewers so we can have an introduction to the implications and concepts of Noragami\u2018s world. She is a good source of comedy however I don\u2019t think she holds much intrigue within the story.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we have Yato\u2019s divine weapon: Yukine. He was a wandering spirit when Yato found him and by nature of this was once human which makes for a good deal of the shows drama as well as Yukine\u2019s own internal anxiety. I found him to be rather irritating as a character \u2013 it is eluded to that he had a tragic or traumatic past as a human however his conflict with Yato and his lot in the show is not tied to this and therefore feels needlessly whiny and unpleasant. He is often at odds with Yato however there didn't appear to be any unique character qualities within Yukine that would give way for this and so his discomfort feels petty. He doesn't exhibit very good character development either and while he does become less unpleasant after a point, it is not even his own doing that leads to this near 180 of attitude. All in all, I felt he was rather annoying and I thought his poorly written character exploration took up much too much time.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs in Noragami are fairly simple except when it comes to the more supernatural characters like other gods or the ayakashi \u2013 Yato himself is best visually characterized by wearing a jersey and sweat pants. The character designs tend to get a little relaxed or lazy if the scene is not of great import or when the characters are depicted as far away however they never become outright terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe combat in the show could almost entirely be described as single-strike or clash based because many of the battles are between Yato wielding Yukine against an otherworldly monster. This isn't necessarily bad however if one was to look into the show for action reasons then these scenes leave a bit to be desired in terms of choreography, length, and overall complexity.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nI think this is where Noragami falls short for most people \u2013 not because the story is poorly written or because the characters act stupid but because there doesn\u2019t seem to be much there to begin with. The premise of the story \u2013 that Yato wishes to become a famously worshiped god and that Hiyori wants her body fixed \u2013 is not something that the story spends much time chasing after. Yes, Yato takes odd jobs in order to increase his recognition and earn his offerings however, as I stated in the [Characters] section, he seem to have much actual ambition and therefore hardly progresses towards his dream within the course of the 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe content that the show actually covers, concerning primarily Yukine\u2019s emotional disposition and later Yato\u2019s dark history, I didn't find as interesting as if the show pursued its original premise more actively. In all honesty, because the show is primarily lighthearted for a good deal of its episodes, I would say that the comedic interactions between the main cast of characters is ultimately of more interest than the plot the show shallowly explores.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music was pretty good and some people may recognize a similar approach and style as to that of Katanagatari as the composer is Iwasaki Taku. I wouldn't say that the music is nearly as good as his other work in my personal opinion however I would say the soundtrack is one of the show\u2019s better appeals. The music mostly occupies a BG-type quality whereas Iwasaki\u2019s work normally takes more of a center stage role in my experience \u2013 the action scenes do play up the music accordingly so I generally enjoy these parts of the music more than others.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nWhile there is a second season now confirmed for Noragami, these 12 episodes felt forgettable to me. The characters weren't very interesting and there were so few of them that the cast of the show felt pretty lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 5\\n\\n\r\nI gave the show a 5 because its well enough animated and has decent music but the show spent its 12 episode run quite poorly in the progression department and had a few actively annoying elements such as Yukine\u2019s dialogue and characterization.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nBecause the show offers very little in overall content \u2013 I have a hard time recommending the show to anyone for genre purposes however someone that\u2019s looking for a supernatural anime would not go amiss as the ayakashi and gods are fairly present throughout the show. The action in Noragami i felt was pretty lackluster save maybe the final confrontation in the show however I don\u2019t think it was a worthy payoff and wouldn't recommend it for this reason. I would say that the show\u2019s strongest point is its comedy and so anyone looking for a good few comedic reaction faces and decent gags would do fine in watching the show however there is a fair amount of drama as well so its not a pure comedy by any means.",

            "content": "This is one of the few anime I got to watch with my brother all the way until the end, which is quite the rare feat. It isn't all that surprising, however. If you read the summary or watched the show already, you know its plot and characters show potential, or that it at least is serviceable/enjoyable.\r\n... Serviceable it was indeed, but it's nothing more than that quality-wise. The plot is basically about this chick named Hiyori saving a guy from a car accident but in the process, becoming half-dead (her soul can leave her body and all that jazz). That guy turns out tobe a minor god named Yato who wants to have his own shrine with many followers one day by doing all sorts of services in exchange for five yen each. Wanting him to turn her back to normal, Hiyori sticks to him because she has to remind the guy that he needs to solve her problem practically every time she sees him.\\n\\n\r\nWell, when you get down to it, this conflict stops having any actual importance a few (2 or 3, I think) episodes later, so uh, no wonder Yato basically shrugs it off. Anyway, gods apparently need these spirit things called Regalias to cut down phantoms and basically be their personal servants, which is where the third protagonist Yukine (can also be Yuki or Sekki because these Regalias apparently have three different names for some reason) comes in to become Yato's Regalia. The story follows these three characters, and the conflicts they go through together... or... something like... that... Pfft.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, right. You're at first made to think the focus is gonna be on Hiyori and Yato, and trying to get her back to normal, but that's a ruse. Instead, Hiyori turns into thin air and acts on nothing despite her initial actions making you think she'd be a decent girl protagonist and Yukine's problems become the focus of the show for way too many episodes, especially when you consider the fact that it all could have been solved if Yato and Yukine just bothered talking to each other about said problems. However, how could there be the magnificent/pointless thing called misunderstandings if they just talked to each other like normal people? I mean, Yato's not technically a person anyway, am I right? \\n\\n\r\nI wasn't asking for the story to be about taking down phantoms, the recurring monsters that influence people on bad levels that only the people on the Far Shore (aka the afterlife) can see, and figuring out how to get Hiyori back to normal: in hindsight, focusing on creatures with no character or depth whatsoever would make for a dull episodic format, which I wouldn't want. However, I also wasn't asking for it to go in this strange direction, all the way until episode 9 at that! The problem with this, if you put aside the bit of stupidity present, is really just the fact that it takes up the majority of the show, and not that it's focusing on a character, or that character in particular: focusing on him is great and all, but I also wanted focus on other characters throughout the anime, like, I dunno, Hiyori (too much to ask out of the show).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, after that, you're introduced to the final arc (I guess: if you consider the beginning to be one arc, and the Yukine part another, then this would be the last arc in the anime), where there's a fairly dramatic conflict caused by a villain that challenges the friendship formed between the three protagonists. Sounds good, right? Even better, you see that no matter what methods are used, this dramatic conflict doesn't get solved so easily, and instead, the villain has to be confronted in this great climax of a final fight and episode. Hyped, aren't you (if you aren't, just roll with it!)?\\n\\n\r\n... Let me tell you why this didn't work:\\n\\n\r\n- There's this character cooperating with the villain who has clear ties to Yato's background and seems really important overall, and yet you get to know nothing about her. At all. Even though you can basically attribute the good dramatic part of this arc to her, you don't see anything about her!\\n\\n\r\n- The villain himself is mediocre. Serviceable, even, like the whole show. Even though he was somewhat hyped with stuff like the opening and whatnot, he's really as generic as you can get. Needless to say I was disappointed, as you'd expect someone more... important or grand from the villain that shows up at the end. You could replace him with a different guy with an equally generic backstory and nothing would really change;\\n\\n\r\n- The fight's not very interesting. It's basically sword fighting, with no noteworthy moves and, well, it's emotional and, uh, um, power-ups, I guess (the pinacle of fine writing). Seriously, the people behind this anime even bothered to put a PANTY SHOT in the midst of the final episode (possibly the most pointless panty shot in the world, by the way, and panty shots are practically pointless to begin with), and it's not like Noragami is littered with fanservice or anything like that! It can make up for not being anything special by the stakes being high (making things more emotional and getting you to care about what's happening), which they were... somewhat. If you care about the characters, that is. Besides, you can't really care about the action when...\\n\\n\r\n- The resolution of the conflict and climax is just stupid. As in, devoid of intelligence, yes. I can even give you examples: Yato is very, very early on established to being able to teleport. He teleports a fair amount of times in the show. He tends to scare Hiyori with this from appearing so suddenly! Teleporting is a total thing with Yato. And yet, Yato doesn't teleport at the very end, when it's needed most, to save a really important x that's on the verge of falling (avoiding spoilers as much as possible), basically dooming what he was trying to save in the first place. Why? Because consistency, man: this show has it in spades, I guess. The stupidity doesn't end here, however: I'm just gonna tell you straight up that every method used to try to solve this conflict, which were legitimate attempts, apparently pales in comparison to the CLEARLY much more meaningful solution of \"I can smell dudes!\". Not even joking (beyond the sarcasm). And that's when the situation's seemingly hopeless in every aspect! Like, are you freaking kidding me?!\\n\\n\r\nIn general, when it comes to the plot of Noragami, my brother even goes as far as to say that \"It's like the show was passed around ten different people\" (basically, that it's all over the place) and you can kind of see what he's talking about. It's first about gods and phantoms and Hiyori's problems (somewhat), but then it starts being all about Yukine, and afterwards it shifts its focus 100% to Yato and gods and the final stuff with their friendship. If you think about it, phantoms are basically irrelevant to the final arc, Yukine's stuff is irrelevant to the first arc, and Hiyori herself becomes irrelevant for a good chunk of the show. They just have no connections whatsoever with each other, so it really feels like certain details get suddenly forgotten along the way for no reason whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I could sort of sense (with shipping goggles) Yato/Hiyori shipping coming with the show, my brother and I legit got misled into thinking Hiyori/Yukine was gonna be a thing midway to the point where my brother got confused when this turned out not to be the case at all. Despite these direction problems, you do end up being behind the developments of Noragami: it's that serviceable. Part of that's because of the equally serviceable cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nYato is a likable, cheerful guy, and a lot of humor comes from him. He wants to be well-known, and us, the viewers, want to see that happening too. He's also mysterious in the sense that there's a lot of backstory to him that we don't know, and that he's not devoid of a serious side. However, we don't get to know anything truly relevant about Yato's past in this anime beyond the fact that he has many female acquaintances and that he killed stuff or whatever (totally unexpected of a god of war, huh?). Not only that, but his serious side wasn't what you'd call meaningful: it just seemed like it was there for the sake of being there, as in, \"Ooooh no, I'm serious, you can't get close to me!\". You know, that sort of thing that easily gets brushed off.\\n\\n\r\nYukine's also not that bad of a character. You can't expect him to be rainbows and sunshine when he's a spirit who's died at a young age, after all. It's just that he was the victim of that middle arc, which I can imagine got many people annoyed with him. Sure, he's not that likable when he basically acts all mean towards Yato and whatnot, but it's not like he's insufferable, and he does fit in with the cast alright.\\n\\n\r\nHiyori's another problem entirely. She's shown to be fairly spirited (badum-tss), with an interest in wrestling and overall a personality you can get behind. This goes as far as to have her copy a move from her favorite wrestler to take down a phantom at the very first episode! Sadly, you don't see any of this afterwards. Instead, she just happens to be 'there' for the rest of the show. You can understand why this is the case: she has no ties with the stuff happening; only Yato and Yukine do. Even so, that doesn't excuse the striking flaw of making a pointless protagonist: when you have a protagonist, they have to have some sort of tie with the events of the story, some role, or at least participate in something.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Hiyori doesn't do anything special until final episodes, though you could argue she actually doesn't do much there either seeing as it's still Yato saving the day and she's basically a damsel in distress. While I also can't call her a wasted potential because she's not amazing or anything of the sort, she was definitely poorly-handled. I'd literally get surprised whenever Hiyori had some semblance of focus in the middle of the show, like, \"Oh, wait, she isn't being thin air now?\". It was pitiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are alright, I guess. They weren't explored all that much, like a lot of the actually interesting stuff going on in the show related to Yato. After all... everything is tied to Yato. Might as well call the show 'Yatogami', am I right? Overall, the character cast is nothing special as far as I could tell from watching the show. Like the story, it's likable, enjoyable and serviceable.\\n\\n\r\nThe same applies to the art and sound. The art looks pretty good, and some of the designs for the phantoms were somewhat creepy, along with the voices they'd have. The character designs are also good, and the animation's not bad at all. The opening's pretty cool to listen to, but I personally didn't really like the rest of the soundtrack. The techno-ish, japanese style-ish sounds with some dude singing out vowels just did not appeal to me (with this, I'm referring to the more prominent tracks). Even so, I can't say it didn't fit the anime. When it comes to voice acting, Hiroshi Kamiya did a good job as always, Yuki Kaji was chosen for an unfortunate role as always and Hiyori\u2019s voice was somehow growing to annoy my brother. In other words, it was good, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the criticism I throw at it, my brother and I were enjoying Noragami a fair amount: though I knew it'd be worthy of a 5 (which doesn't count as a negative score to me) from the get-go, I didn't have a terrible time watching it. Even my brother, who doesn't watch anime all that much and drops anything if the tiniest thing doesn't appeal to him, wanted to see it through to the end, which is definitely saying something about how enjoyable it is to watch, and not in that 'so bad it's good' way. Instead, Noragami is the kind of show you enjoy in that 'turn your brain off and it's a masterpiece' way, and there's nothing wrong with that. After all, it is really serviceable.\\n\\n\r\n... Seeing something yet? Like me hammering the fact that Noragami's serviceable? Because that's really the point of the review. To point out that Noragami's an alright show. That it's enjoyable, likable, 'meh'. There's nothing really deep you get out of it, and you don't have to either. It doesn't convey anything truly meaningful or absolutely breathtaking, but that's fine: you can pass time with this anime. The story's enjoyable, the characters are likable, the production values are pretty nice, and it's overall a serviceable, 'meh' show. There's nothing in it that makes me feel anything more. But that's not what I can call a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nSo, well, I suppose I'd recommend this to basically anyone as a way to kill time. It can appeal to a lot of people, after all. I mean, it's even got a second season now... which I'll never watch. Though I've originally written the review before such an announcement was even made, I decided to re-write it since its writing quality wasn't good enough, in my opinion, to get my points across. Let's hope it's actually better now. Either way, I can imagine that Noragami won't fail to deliver the same quality with its second season, so if you really liked this show, you might as well give that a try. \\n\\n\r\nServiceable it was indeed, but serviceable never hurt anyone.",

            "content": "Thunder's Review no.1: Noragami\r\nIt seems that Noragami caught attention of many this winter season, witch is understandable based on the fact that it's produced by studio Bones, famous for their rather high production values. Additionally being an adaptation of rather famous manga certainly make it a high priority show for many. Is Noragami really worth attention it gets from the community? Well, it is definitely enjoyable show but it have its share of problems that keep it from being really good.\r\nThe Story 5/10\r\nIn world of Noragami gods exist and walk the earth in secret. Just as in human society some have it better than others.There are those who have legions of followers and many shrines dedicated to them and those lesser gods that have to run around as errand boys to require believers. Our main protagonist, war god Yato ranks among the latter. Day by day Yato bravely hunt hollows (monstrosities born of human suffering) and brush toilets clean for a low price of 5 yen per wish. One day he stumbles upon a girl named Iki Hiyori and saves her life. By doing so Yato grubbed her soul out of her body and she became a half hollow. And so our favorite war god try to help Hiyori get back to normal. Of course things get complicated on the way. Hiyori gets introduced to different gods and a whole different world alien to her.\\n\\n\r\nThe story have some interesting concepts, mostly surrounding Yatos past but many things are just introduced to us just to be left out in the dark later on. Noragami obviously suffers from the same problem as other manga adaptations, parts of the story are just being left out of the anime or simply didn't get there yet. The ending is not that great either and do a poor job on summarizing everything up and giving us a decent conclusion. Still, story have some value to it. It's interesting enough to keep you engage so you can enjoy the rest of what this show have to offer. It also include some good morals you can keep with you as you leave the show behind if you care for that sort of things. I know that I do to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of studio Bones Noragami is beautifully animated. Movements are fluid, light effects flashy and backgrounds full of details. Of course fight scenes are parts when the animations are on their best. Even comedy parts of the show keep up the high quality of animation. Also I have to give a praise for character designs they are quite memorable, mostly thanks to colour contrasts. There are just few short moments when animation quality drops for a moment and they are not easily found.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack in Noragami is different from what you will hear in other shows. It have original sound to it. There are few trucks that stand out witch of my favorite is Noratan, it appear to pump up atmosphere when something epic is about to happen. Just listen to it:\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOpening is very good, both when it comes to song(performed by \"Hello Sleepwalkers\") and the animation. In fact when I watched opening first time I thought that it was animated by SHAFT and that it's saying something about its quality. Ending was all right (girls with umbrellas getting really popular nowadays).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also top quality featuring some of the best in the industry. Even Mr. Fukuyama known mainly for his role as Lelouch in Code Geass voiced one of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of interesting characters present, sadly we don't get to know much of their past. Even when they are members of the main cast. Nonetheless most of the characters are charismatic and fun to watch. Everybody of the main cast goes through bigger or lesser development. It's rushed, it's forced but it's their. Hopefully we'll get second season that will explain backstory of the key characters more, or I would be forced to read manga. When I think about it, it doesn't sounds that bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nThanks to great production value, decent comedy, amazing fight scenes and overall coolness of the show I enjoyed it quite a lot. If we would just get good conclusion at the end it would be great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nNoragami turned out to be a decent show, definitely worth few hours of my cold winter evenings. When it's failed to give us story with good conclusion its high production values and overall coolness make it enjoyable to watch.",

            "content": "Noragami Full Review\r\nHave you ever felt that you wanted an anime with relatable and well-written characters, coupled with an interesting story filled with action and comedy? Well, look no further, because Noragami is here.\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nNoragami\u2019s story, I would have to say, be a rather unique one. I say so because the anime spends a lot of time in the beginning introducing you to the characters, and make you wonder, just where is the main story? When are they going to get on with it? However, that\u2019s where this anime shines. The overarching story has been there the whole time \u2013 blended well with the characterdevelopments, which provides an even stronger impact when it reaches the climax. So, what is Noragami mainly about? I would say that it is the relationships between our characters, and what they did to solve them. Why did I give the story a 9 out of 10, then? This is because of how relatable these stories are, and of course the valuable lessons it has taught us \u2013 Appreciate what you have.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nI have one word for Noragami\u2019s main cast and side cast: \u201cAmazing\u201d. This was perhaps one of the few anime where the cast support and play off each other so well, that makes it not only seem realistic, but also a joy to watch as well. Not forgetting, the characters by the end of the series have totally changed from what they used to be in the first episodes.\\n\\n\r\nYato is a God who doesn\u2019t have a shrine built for him, and so grants people wishes for 5 yen, in hopes that one day, he\u2019ll finally get enough money to built a shrine for himself. In the anime, Yato is more like a fatherly figure to all of the other characters. Sure, he fools around, but he always does what\u2019s best for the group, even though his reasons are not seen immediately. That\u2019s just like how a father is, isn\u2019t it. One who doesn\u2019t always seem to be there with you but supporting you quietly.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Yato is like a fatherly figure, Hiyori is the motherly figure. I would say that she is the exact opposite to Yato. She looks at things mostly on the surface, but she is always there to support both Yato and Yukine, often reprimanding them for their actions. But why is this so? It\u2019s because she cares for them, just like a mother would. Additionally, in the beginning of the anime, most people would think that Hiyori would be this damsel in distress; basically a useless character that needed saving by the guys. However, this is not the case, as we see she can capably handle herself in fights, and sometimes even be the one to help out both Yukine and Yato.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be spending a little bit more time to talk about Yukine. I would say that Yukine is probably the most controversial character in the series. There has been a lot of hate towards him, but I\u2019ll have to say that the hate is unjustified. Why? Yukine is a teenager. Merely a 13-year-old boy. Of course by that age he would know from right and wrong, but from 13 to 18 years of age, it is known as the rebellious age. You know what is right and wrong, but you still commit the wrongdoings anyway. Why? Because it is fun to disobey the rules. Rules are meant to be broken, right? Everyone, or almost everyone has been in this stage before (unless you\u2019re under 13 of course). That is why Yukine was acting the way he was. However, the problem kicks in when his rebellious nature is coupled with the longing to belong somewhere. This is yet another trait of the teenagers. In school, just as Yato mentions, everyone wants to be popular right? Everyone wants to have the most friends. The point here is that Yukine is dead, and he cannot interact with them. Yet the living, which can have almost everything and anything that Yukine doesn\u2019t, complain and do not appreciate it. Chasing after something he can never obtain\u2026 That is what made Yukine lose his mind. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks really beautiful. You can notice this especially with the character designs (just look at Yato\u2019s eyes) and during the fight scenes. The destruction of the phantoms after Yato\u2019s killing blow looks amazing. I do have one little gripe though, they reuse the same animation when Yato does his final move every episode. Yes, I get that that\u2019s because it's the same move, but it would be great if they could vary that up a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great since it matches every scene perfectly, whether it being a scary scene, or action scene. I have to give credit to the phantom\u2019s voices, for being so creepily fitting. Of course, our voice actors are amazing as well, being able to bring both the comedy and serious voices when they are required.\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening and Ending are both really, really good; There\u2019s no way you\u2019d want to skip that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I have with Noragami, is perhaps the wait every week. Just as something interesting was about to happen, the episode ends.  In other words, I enjoyed it immensely. This is mainly because they know when to inject comedy, and when to make it serious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is a really amazing anime. It not only provides great characters, but awesome stories that are highly relatable. Coupled with beautiful art and soundtrack, this anime is a must watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever needed help with something from a higher being? Was there ever a moment where you decided to seek help because you couldn\u2019t get the task done yourself? There\u2019s an answer to that now: Delivery God Yato. The catch is that he does require a fee for his services. Yet, the guy gets his hands dirty to the point and is the solution to your problems.\r\nAt first glance, a series about a God trying to be a deity of worship seems something that\u2019s hard to take in by heart. Rather, Gods are usually depicted as being powerful, omniscient, and shines with brilliance. That\u2019s what Yatotries to be anyways someday. As someone who is barely known in the real world community, he\u2019s far from that. Yato\u2019s job of helping others for a price as a God is something that doesn\u2019t seem so appealing at first. His goal is apparently to build a shrine of worship and have his name being recognized by everyone. He doesn\u2019t have many followers nor does he have the ability of omniscience. Yet, he does have the ability to draw attention towards him, especially Hiyori Iki, a high school student who almost witness him get into a car accident. Fate has it for them when Hiyori saves him but not without her life being changed forever. \\n\\n\r\nBy traditional standards, high school girls saving a supernatural being isn\u2019t new to the anime industry. Yet, Noragami shines with its own charms on various terms. For instance, we have a young girl who is selfless, brave, and eager to help others in need. She puts others before herself and her actions often speak louder than words. Despite her life being seemingly changed forever, she doesn\u2019t blame anyone for it but rather hope to use her new abilities to continuously help others. This brings her in terms with the n narcissistic God, Yato. Their relationship is odd at first with the duo often complaining and arguing about seemingly events of little importance. Despite that, they are surprisingly entertaining to watch in particular Yato. He makes the time fly fast with his characteristics as a God by helping others but not without a price. (Charging 5 yen for a completed task) It stands out for the fact that Yato helps others for his own personal gain rather than just \u2018doing the right thing\u2019. With this set up, you can guess why Yato and Hiyori often gets into debates. These are often comical because in some ways, they are compatible. Hiyori is no shadow to be stepped on despite her kindness. She is able to stand up for herself and take responsibilities. Similarly, Yato has a natural sense of humor with a sense of himself. Sometimes, his behavior reflects human emotions such as regret, jealousy, and solitude. Despite being so different, Yato and Hiyori has a special relationship viewers will feel attached to.\\n\\n\r\nOn other hand, there\u2019s one character where viewers will find less appealing at first and hard to get used to. Meet Yukine, a wandering spirit that Yato made into a weapon for his job. To appreciate Yukine will be difficult as he acts just like his age as a brat. He isn\u2019t mature for someone his age and neither does he have a tolerable sense of humor. Despite being a spirit, he acts like a human such as his perverseness, curiosity, and even suffers from kleptomania. It is somewhat acceptable at first to understand where he came from \u2013 a child whom missed the opportunity of a normal life as evidenced by some flashbacks. Yet, his present actions does not constitute to justify his reasons to do collateral damage to others. Yukine becomes a character that is developed by deconstruction. Rather than having him remain like a brat, he undergoes through phases and reflects his change in a way that he seems like a whole new person. Noragami depicts his character at his best with this change that shows development in a way that is humane, credible, and stands as a visage of redemption.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show focusing a lot of in characters, the plot is also attractive with its themes. Various themes explored in the series includes suicide, bullying, revenge, and temptation. As a fantasy series, it colors these themes in a way that is both humorous but at the same time feel so real. It sticks with the premise as well throughout its duration to explore concepts involving dealing with Phantoms, beings of the supernatural world that inhibits in the world of the living. Most of these features in a format of the\u2018monster of the week\u2019 scenario. However, it is important to note that every monster or conflict explores a concept to send a message. As the plot is unraveled more and more, we also find more about Yato\u2019s past which seems to be ominous. One particular character holds a deep grudge for Yato in a cat-and-mouse like game throughout the series. It sparks curiosity to viewers as Yato\u2019s past life as compared to his present. But with new friends, it also sets up a contrast between the two stages; it makes Yato view his weapons as a different light, perhaps as friends rather than just tools of war. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps fitting with the stories\u2019 concepts are the spirits involved. After all, this show does present it in fantasy form with the way spirits behave around humans. The rather obvious trope of the spirits revolves around their behavior as nearly all of them behave in an aggressive manner. As malevolent as they can be, these spirits are to be tamed with Yato as the delivery God. Even though it has a serious premise, the comedy coming from Noragami can be described as healthy. Rather than lifeless fan service, we get Yato whom presents himself as a character of charisma that invites laughter. Some of his lack of social behavior is marked with comedy thanks to his failures in the field. To support even more of the high dosage of humor are characters such as Kofuku, an energetic girl and acquaintance of her beloved \u201cYatty\u201d. On the other hand, there\u2019s Nora, a girl of many mysteries that brings in a moody sphere of gloom and doom. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of Noragami is simple yet consistent handled by Bones. Taking place in modern world means that nothing should be out of the ordinary. Yet, we get those spirits decorated by malevolence as harbingers of destruction. Background designs also makes its point with the suburban city combined with traditional Japanese themes such as shrines and altars. The character designs sparks curiosity such as Hiyori\u2019s tail. Yato\u2019s artwork design also looks interesting with his electric blue eyes, tough attitude, and jersey that comes with a scarf. The weapon (Shinki) that he uses is attractive with its stellar design. That\u2019s not the only weapon the show focuses on though. Later in the series, we witness other powerful weapons in the form of whips, guns, and even earrings all decorated with a sense of fantasy vibe. On a more negative note, Yukine\u2019s design matches those of a rebellious teenager with his blonde hair and smirk that seems to reflect loneliness. \\n\\n\r\nA strength that brings the action packed scenes of Noragami would be the soundtrack. The OST elaborates on the solid movements of the characters. No movement is wasted and all of them matches consistently with its well-coordinated orchestra. The OP song by Hello Sleepwalkers is highly decorative with characters from the cast colored by an unique form of artistry. The voice mannerisms mostly matches such as Yato\u2019s sarcasm, Hiyori\u2019s maturity, Yukine\u2019s childishness, and Kofuku\u2019s cheerfulness. Nonetheless, do appreciate the OST. I bring this to attention again as headphones are a must to enjoy this at fullest.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami will offer everybody a chance for enjoyment. It will deliver action, drama, comedy, and fantasy at your footsteps. Being a more character driven show, its small yet small cast of characters delivers credibility related to human behaviors that are explored in a relatable way. The soundtrack will blow your mind along with its high dosage of comical power. It\u2019s not just the way dialogues are spoken but how it connects to the character and story. Speaking of the story, Noragami does take a bit of patience to get used to but in the end is worth it to reap its rewards. On a more negative note, a story arc involving Yato and a particular character who has hunted him down for her entire life doesn't resolve. The length of the series prevents the anime from creating a resolution for its pace. Still, this show to me is a dark horse and something of a gem, a sparkling jewelry you won\u2019t find at any shrine but here. \\n",

            "content": "Okay, I believe that many of you have heard of the term that is widely used in anime reviews, book reviews, moview reviews, etc. Yes, it's the \"Don't judge a book by its cover\". Apparently, that idiom applies to Noragami as well. Why? It\u2019s quite simple, while the anime has a nice cover, a nice premise, and also nice previews (which came out several of times before the anime aired) the anime itself isn't nice at all. Then, is it bad? No no no, not at all. It isn\u2019t nice because it's actually above nice . It-it was amazing, way beyond expectations. Of course i'mnot going to say that without preparing a reason before hand. *cough* Lets begin then.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 9/10\\n\\n\r\n(If you haven't, please read the synopsis above first then continue reading). Okay then, simply put, the story is about a god named Yato; his weapon,Yukine; and a schoolgirl which is a half phantom, Hiyori. There isn't anything complex about the story, though it could be described as a unique. The plot is great, well executed and also well paced, though it feels like it's rushed a bit at some point. But it seems that doesn't really affect the enjoyment since it's pretty much unnoticeable anyway. The individual elements of the story is also a surplus, for example the action. Action in this anime is a no joke at all. Battles are very fluid and isn't pointless no matter how you look at it. Please don't group this anime with those typical shounen action anime with battles in every episode throughout the anime from the beginning till the very end. I don't say this often, but the thoughts on my head while I was watching it was like, \"really cool\", \"awesome\", \"amazing\", \"we want more, we want more\". All the battles in this anime has a meaning and also a lot of emotions . Though, there aren't that many battles since it's not the sole main aspect of the story. Another element of the story that you'll be getting a lot if you're going to watch it is the relationship progress between the characters which spans until the last episode. And, although the anime doesn't have a comedy genre written in the information page, there are actually comedies in this anime and they're are really funny. There's also little a romance in it, but maybe too little. \\n\r\nOh, maybe it's too a little too late to say this but the anime is dark themed. The main time of the anime seems to be evening till night. Also, sometimes the phantom are really scary with many creepy eyes in its dark body, creepy voice of multiple people saying a sentence together telling a certain someone to desperately commit suicide. That\u2019s not a bad thing though. \\n\r\nAfter going through a lot of battles and conflicts with a lot of emotions, the ending was really satisfying. Maybe not that satisfying since it causes the anime to end and made a lot of people demanding more and more. :P But still, an ending is an ending, and i'm going to say this again ~it was really satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother great aspect that made this anime better and better is the characters. The characters in Noragami are all well rounded. The different types of personality of the three main characters was great. I'm sorry if I used too much good adjectives in this review since it's undeniable-ly(bad English of mine) great in many ways. Yato is strong, badass and looks pretty stupid, but he gets serious when something happens to  Yukine or Hiyori. On the other hand, Yukine is a rebellious boy, something like a delinquent who isn't really grateful of Yato's decision of picking him as his sacred weapon. He gets ...*spoiler*. Then there\u2019s Hiyori. A human who turns into a Half-Phantom because she tried to save Yato from getting hit by a bus, but made herself getting hit by it instead.  Hiyori is a nice and cheerful girl who likes to tag along with Yato and Yukine\u2019s godly activities. She can\u2019t stand the idea of the the two getting hurt. Supporting casts are pretty good too, but i\u2019m not going to go too deep into it. (Watch it by yourself okay?)\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that popped in my head when watching the first episode was \u2018Beautiful\u2019.  The studio responsible for this beautiful artwork and animation is Bones. If you haven\u2019t heard about it, it\u2019s the studio well-known for many great and popular shounen anime, like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Darker than Black, Soul Eater, Eureka Seven and a much more. And... if you\u2019re not familiar with any of those, I\u2019ll tell you how it\u2019s very pleasant for the eye.  Fluid eye-catching battles, nice character design and, beautiful breathtaking backgrounds is what you\u2019re going to get from Noragami. So, that\u2019s how it got a 9/10(great) score from me.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nReally nice OP and ED. The OP is called Hello Sleepwalkers, which is a a rock themed song.  The artist is a band named Hello Sleepwalkers and the name of the song is Goya no Machiawase. I don\u2019t know about the band before and I just found out about it from watching Noragami, but hell it was really good. And, the ED is called Heart Realize by the famous group of musician in the anime industry, Supercell. The quality of the song is superb.\\n\r\nVoice acting are great too. Seiyuu\u2019s voice really feels like it matched the characters\u2019s personality. The background sounds also fits the atmosphere. I really like the battle\u2019s background music which is really unique. Of course, sounds are undescribable by words so, please watch it by yourself to hear it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOh, those good times of waiting every week for a new episode. I enjoyed this anime fully with all of my heart. It get\u2019s me anxious every time and I really want to know what\u2019s going to happen next. There are some episodes that has a great comedy and made me laugh out loud, some that has great battles, some that has a lot of emotions and affects my emotions as well, and the last episode that made me say \u201cplease don\u2019t end!\u201d.  Of course, I\u2019ll be hoping for a second season since there are plenty of story material waiting to be animated, but I guess hoping to much could lead to bad day if it doesn't go your way.  But overall I really enjoyed this series. 10 points from me :D.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words\\n\\n\r\nNoragami or \u30ce\u30e9\u30ac\u30df is a great action-shounen anime that has a great story and not-pointless battles and also a little comedy. If you liked those genres, then without doubt, you\u2019ll like Noragami even more. I highly recommended it to everyone looking for a great series to spend their time at.\\n",

            "content": "Its really honestly a shame that this anime isn't more popular than it is. I find more and more its harder to get into action animes when you've watched so many that let your hopes down in the last two episodes. Nowadays, anime seem to either wow me to tears or bore me with uninteresting characters set in a plot that's way too cool for the likes of cardboard characters. Or your get anime that is just plain worthy of throwing to the depth of the internet where you could care less whether someone actually gives any shit about. Forgettable. Noragami for me wasn't anyof those. Not even worthy of putting into the wow me to tears section. What this anime did for me was made me think - and that's why this anime, in my opinion, is definitely one of the best Ive ever seen this season.\\n\\n\r\nTo be totally frank, I'm not usually one for the typical shounen, and tend to like the dark more gritty animes. I usually watch these sort of shounen ones when I just can't find anything worthy of my tastes. But oh boy, was I glad to have picked up Noragami. This anime really sets in the terrifying mind set of being forgotten by all the people around you, and what one must to do be remembered and to feel wanted by those people. I found each time Yato struggled to maintain himself, through being remembered and worshiped, my heart would go out to him and I felt the pain of being lost and old and forgotten.\\n\\n\r\n-I'm not going to rewrite a synopsis, so if you really want to know all the nitty gritty details, read it at the top-\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around God names Yato, his regalia and a half phantom, Hyori. I learned to love each and every character in this series - each having good character and executing realistic choices int he plot of this anime. The blend of Japanese folklore was very visually interesting, and I always seem to enjoy those types of anime with underlying subtexts and messages.\\n\\n\r\nI tend to dislike when Main characters are treated badly by the rest of the cast, just because they seem to give off a weak or annoying sort of aura ( even if us viewers know how bad ass they really can be) So i was very cautious with Noragami. It seemed like everyone thought Yato, the protagonist, was your typical bum and purposefully exclude him for only that reason, even if he was a god. But that soon turned around, in about the second episode. Sure, they still liked to tease the protagonist about his habits and how poor and helpless he was - but there was still a sort of underlying respect that each character had for him, and they grew to cherish Yato. Hyori for example, explains her dislike and annoyance in yato, yet still respects him and wants to be with him. Hyori is a typical female lead, who can actually hold her own and has a decent personality. I have a thing with helpless female leads that pisses me off to no end, so seeing a female character, strong and willing like Hyori, is a breath of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is stellar. I tend to be quite nitpicky with art and Noragami was outstanding. The character designs were realistic, clothing appropriate and animations amazing. The colours used for the fight scenes and phantom deaths made you want to stare at the sequence for hours, analyzing the design of the star that seemed to explode out whenever Yato killed a phantom. The phantoms themselves were drawn organically lovely - but still gave a sort of creep atmosphere. The blights and eyes were done marvelous, showing the disgusting of infection. The blue hue all over yato gave him a godly aura, yet he still looked human from the blend of his modern clothing. I could go on but I wont. Just that the art of this anime seemed to never cut loops and always keep me interested.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is absolutely amazing, bringing in traditional Japanese music with a sort of modern rap and hip hop themes. The opening fits extremely well, though it changes three times throughout the series. I didn't mind it at all, and actually enjoyed seeing the variety. The ending was cute, not that memorable but I did actually watch the ending, which I never do so that's saying something. The music during the fight scenes was intense, and got you into the mood of traditional style, not unlike the Yato god himself. The music for the phantoms was down right creepy, and suited the atmosphere to a T. And finally the music played for yato's silliness... was down right hilarious. The funky off tones of the beat made me giggle every time even if the situation wasn't that funny.\\n\\n\r\nYato in particular is a very interesting character to follow. Development wise, he didn't really change much outwardly form what originally saw. I would almost call it a sort of backwards character development, because we got to see how he developed into the Yato god he is now. Throughout the anime I found myself gaining respect for the god, seeing his struggle and triumphs. He mirrored it through Yukine, his regalia. Yukine had the most character development in this anime. We see him rise, to fall, to slowly rise back again. His personality was bitchy, yes, but with good reason. Characters who lash out for no reason, and all the cast seem to be okay with it is just plain bad writing, but Noragami gives Yukine a damn good reason for it and has the characters react to it positively, because of particular a reason as well. Forget about a hollow anime, this one actually bothered to give good, concrete reasons for a melt down, which I find animes recently have been lacking severely. The interaction between Yato's extravagant character and Yukine's major attitude was very interesting to see. Both grew closer together throughout the anime making me yearn for more scenes of Yato and Yukine interacting.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gives a perfects blend of action, comedy, supernatural and mystery that will have you itching for more every episode. The anime is well spaced, even though it diverges slightly at the end from the manga (if you bothered to read it) - but still keeps it fresh and fulfilling. I would recommend this anime to anybody, and hope you enjoy it as much as I did - this anime will always have a special place in my heart.\\n\\n",

Great show for younger teenagers\r\n-If you are looking for something intellectually stimulating, I would not bother.  \r\nThe show takes stuff that has been done before and presents it in a way that flows well and feels pretty natural.  \r\nThe Good:\r\n-characters are likable and despite them being gods and regalias, they are pretty believable.\r\n-humor is very well executed.\r\n-no filler\r\nThe Bad:\r\n-Thisshow screams chuunibyou syndrome.  Almost everytime Yato, the MC gets into a fight, he has this very cheesy spiel involving a special backdrop.

            "content": "Five yen is all it takes to get your wish granted. (If only that were true).\r\nNoragami is a series that I really enjoyed and felt good watching. The saddest part being the fact that it only had 11 episodes and honestly deserves a lot more. I am left hoping for a sequel that I am certain will not disappoint.\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nSound: 9/10\r\nCharacter: 8/10\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\r\nOverall: 8/10\r\nGood points:\r\n+Very good male and female protagonists\r\n+Diverse range of character personalities\r\n+Comic humour\r\n+Touching, romantic scenes\r\n+Good actions sequences where it counts\r\n+Great OP and ED themes\r\nBad points:\r\n-Lack of overarching conflict\r\n-Underwhelming antagonists\r\nYou will love this anime if you love:\r\n1. Cute scenes that makes you feellike this --> :3\\n\r\n2. Shounen action sequences\\n\r\n3. Cut-the-long-story short romance (like seriously, enough of those long monologues, romance should be short and sweet)\\n\r\n4. Swordfighting/Slashing YEAH!\\n\r\n5. Comic humour\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is split into three main arcs. The first being an introductory arc which tells you all about the 3 main characters, Yato, Yukine and Hiyori and how they came to meet, the second arc being the main conflict with Yukine's corruption and the third arc (lasting only 3 episodes) being the final battle against Rabo, the killer god of calamity.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc is full of comedy and funny parts thanks to Yato's very lively and exaggerated personality, Hiyori's kick-ass moves and Yukine's cute reactions. The three share a chemistry that would make anyone comfortable watching through all of it, even if there isn't much of a plot line. All we have is the trio doing odd jobs and trying to earn money to build a shrine (+1)\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is where the first main conflict kicks in, where Yato and Yukine's life is threatened through  \"corruption\" of Yukine's soul. Yukine becomes stubborn and violent and ends up blighting Yato so much that Yato nearly dies. Yato however, refuses to give up Yukine or punish him, and instead sacrifices himself in order to show Yukine his sins. The plot line is quite gripping, so I'm giving full points for it (+3).\\n\\n\r\nThe third arc is where Yato faces off with his long-time old partner Rabo, who is still clinging on to the wicked wishes of people. Yato, however, has changed and shows Rabo who's boss in a very action-packed sequence. The main inconsistency though is how Yato kept on saying that Yukine \"might die\" against Rabo's power, but clearly, even when Rabo absorbed all the Phantoms for power, Yukine was nowhere near dying, and Yato was essentially still going strong. I thought that Rabo was generally underwhelming near the end and had little or no plan at all against Yato. Doesn't he know how strong Yato can actually be? He ended up saying \"I actually wanted to die, btw\", and I was like... uhh ok. Meh. (+2)\\n\\n\r\nSo altogether, there were only 2 main plot lines, but they were quite okay independently. There was no overarching conflict, although the anime does hint to a second season because of the mysterious Nora that we still don't know much about.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought that art was clean and smooth. I didn't like the way the phantoms were being drawn though. The shapes and sizes of the phantoms were also really random, and incidentally just resembled about anything the artist thought about (frogs, stingrays, snakes, crabs) basically based off random animals in general. But everything else was nice, especially the animation of Sekki which I was totally hooked to, as well as the abilities of all the other Regalias as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound for the anime was definitely top-notch. I loved both the OP and ED themes, and the back ground music for both the touching scenes and action scenes were really good. It never bore me at all, so it was a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's only a 11 episode anime so I can't ask for much, but I thought that character development fleshed out definitely could be improved. Only Yato's past and backstory was even touched upon, but that was interesting enough to keep me watching. I wished they had put more backstory to Yukine though, maybe what Yukine was like when he was still alive? There was, however, a lot of character growth in Yukine, so I think that makes up for all the lack of backstory that he had. (+3)\\n\\n\r\nThough Yato is my favourite characters (just because he can hack N slash), I want to specially mention Hiyori as well. She's generous, kind, full of love and compassion and understanding. She makes sacrifices, shows appreciation, gives hope and is just this stable rock that completely compliments Yato. I think Hiyori is an excellent female lead in this anime and she NEVER felt annoying like so many other female characters that I come across. She can also kick ass, so that's why she's awesome. (+2)\\n\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters were also very interesting. We have the Bishamon team, the Kufuku duo and the \"Tenjin and his concubines\", all of whom really help with the whole comic element to the anime. The character personalities are very diverse and interesting, and definitely a pull factor for this anime. (+2)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the antagonists, Rabo was interesting at first, but honestly he became very shallow toward the end. Only Nora was a point of interest in the entire anime, but she also didn't do much but tempt Yato to use her. Although the anime never really explained why Yato didn't want to use her, as if using a Nora would corrupt his soul or something, but this is something that I am assuming.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I thought that the character interactions and relationships were very well crafted. This was one of the few animes where I actually LOVED the main characters for who they are and felt a sense of emotional attachment to them just because of that bubbly feeling inside. Aww. Especially all the cute face rubbing and general cuteness of all the characters. :3 (+1)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe comic element to this anime is really good. And I love it because it doesn't even pride itself as a \"comedy\" genre, but it made me laugh a lot more than other comedy animes that I've watched, just because of the really good characters and solid slapstick. One particularly funny part was when Yato was flying downwards and talking to a guy who was falling off a the top of a roof for like 5 minutes and Yukine was like, \"Hmm this seems like a really long fall, dont'cha think?\" (+3)\\n\\n\r\nOther funny parts include almost every interaction with the Kufuku duo and every time Yukine gets into a rather awkward position with Hiyori. (oh yes and Hiyori falcon kicking everyone in her way). The anime also got me very excited across each episode, and I honestly didn't want to stop until I reached the end. It wasn't that it was very suspenseful, but that it was very engaging and I knew that it would not disappoint my taste time and time again. (+3)\\n\\n\r\nThere was not a single time when I felt bored watching this anime, and I think that's a plus point. The pacing was just right. Not too fast and not too slow, they really emphasized on the parts that made you feel for the characters. (+2)\\n\\n\r\nI particularly loved the Sekki activation scenes, it just gets me every time. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA very good job well done to the creators of this anime. I think it was ALOT of potential to be honest. Now that all the main characters are fleshed out, all they need to do is develop them even further, expand to the rest of the supporting cast, dump all of them into a convincing plot narrative/conflict and you will get an amazing sequel.",

            "content": "The perfect balance of spiritual conflict and slice of life comedy.\r\nStory - 8/10 Noragami is another installation of a trend of recent series that are trying to incorporate youkai battle plots with a light hearted slice of life/comedy/romance element, and surprisingly Noragami is able to pull it off. Without giving away any spoilers, the story is quite unique because it is able to find a great balance between series scenes and funny moments. The drama and action are enough to keep you enticed, and the RomCom isn't so overbearing that the side stories take away from the main plot. The only part of the storyI didn't care for was Yukine's arc. I thought it was a bit too dramatic and lasted too long, but if you can get over his annoying immaturity for a few episodes the rest of the series is great.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8/10 the artwork of Noragami is pretty good, with a unique op and closing to boot. The fighting scenes aren't over done, the scenery has great detail, and all the characters have unique characteristics compared to the typical anime types.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -10/10 The best part of Noragami is the characters, literally the only one that wasn't a 10/10 was Yukine. However, I realize he had to have more drastic development than other characters so I'm still giving this section a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - 8/10 overall I thought Noragami was a great series, and has a lot to offer everyone. It is funny, exciting, and heartfelt at times without having too many filler episodes. My only complaints are the distribution of episodes to certain arcs, and the fact that the series itself is only 12 episodes. I feel that if it had been given 25 or so, there would have been more time for better plot development and the ending wouldn't have felt so rushed. But alas 12 is all we get, and I would recommend this series to anyone, and especially those who like sword play and spiritual world genres.",

            "content": "Noragami, or as I like to call it \u201cEveryone Loves Yato\u201d, has a lot going for it. It looks nice, it's got appealing characters, and has a unique soundtrack. But the way the story presents itself in its short 12 episode run time has some dire consequences.\r\nStory (6/10):  \r\nNoragami is all over the place. First we are introduced to the supposed main conflict of fixing Hiyori\u2019s condition, but that gets put off as we get some filler of Yato desperately trying to make some money. These episodes were amusing and can pull off some good action and laughs, but being time wasters, there prettymuch insignificant. The majority of the show focuses on the relationship between Yato and Yukine which was actually well done and the only part of Noragami that had a decent payoff. It contains enough teen angst to be relatable, but not too much to be irritating. But this leaves us with just three episodes left to explore Yato\u2019s past. It not really compelling as its not really explored in depth and in the end, it turns out to be another damsel in distress story. It just ends up feeling insignificant like the filler before it, not the best way to end the series.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I could compare its pacing style to be Bebop. After all, both have a main conflict which is delayed in favor of some filler episodes. Cowboy Bebop succeeded as the fillers were good (for the most part) and its main conflict was resolved within its 26 episode run. Noragami, on the other hand, doesn't just leave its main conflict hanging, but various sub-plots are unsolved and the filler we got ranged from decent to plain extraneous. This was inevitable because of the 12 episode run. With 12 episodes, you simply don\u2019t have the time to mess around too much when you have so many open subplots left hanging. \\n\\n\r\nSome may say that this is excused because season 2 was announced. To that I say, not really. You cannot rely on the hopes for a 2nd season to resolve conflicts. When i'm watching a season, I at least expect some kind of a satisfying resolution (i'm looking at you Tokyo Ghoul), because to be honest, most anime don\u2019t even get a second season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nYato, our main protagonist, is a well rounded character. He\u2019s funny (with some of the funniest faces you\u2019ll ever see) and can even be bad-ass when he wants to be. But thanks to the shaky plot, what we know about Yato is incredibly vague. Oh yeah, remember how I called this show \u201cEveryone Loves Yato\u201d. Well lemme explain, Yato seems to have a relationship with everyone in the show. Its constantly implied he has history with them, but the show never really touches upon these histories. The side characters aren't really fleshed out and it leads to them just being there cause the plot said so with the worst offender being Bishamon. She\u2019s out to kill Yato for a simple reason, but the show never actually shows the story behind it other than they hate each other. \\n\\n\r\nYukine is the most developed character in the show. That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s the most likable, but seeing Yukine struggling with the problems of being dead coupled with the frustration of teen angst is believable and at times heartfelt. Seeing him grow and develop is truly satisfying. As for Hiyori, she\u2019s a mixed bag. She starts off rather decent and strong with her inspiration of wrestling moves. But as the series progresses, she suffers something I\u2019d like to call the Asuna effect in which she devolves to become less of a character and less capable of defending herself to the point of becoming a damsel in distress. As likable as she was, she\u2019s really nothing more than the typical schoolgirl archetype with some minor quirks.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (7/10): \\n\\n\r\nStudio Bones once again does a great job with the animation. The character designs were appealing and the phantom had a very creative look to them even if they were just colorful, floating sea creatures. When the phantom\u2019s die, they let some sort of a, how do I say it, wordy explosion and it looks gorgeous every time. Unfortunately, the phantom fights got to be underwhelming at times as it was just Yato doing the same chant over and over again with the same animation and line (sometimes twice per episode) followed by a single slash. The stand out action scenes were the ones involving two gods which was definitely the highlight of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening for Noragami just screams cool. While I don\u2019t think the show reaches the Rule of Cool, this opening got me hyped for every episode even when the story got underwhelming. The black and white characters blended well with the blue colored environment. The song on its own is catchy and is fitting with the show. The ending, on the other hand, is meh. Its not bad and it slightly grew on me after a few listens, but it just felt a bit generic and didn't blend well with the upbeat nature of the show or the opening.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Noragami is a hit or miss. At first glance it may sound a little odd with one of the battle themes sounding like a guy saying \u201crectangle\u201d over and over again. But for me, it fits with the show quite well. The soundtrack has quite a bit of hip hop along with some tunes that fit really well with the shinto themes. You\u2019ll definitely get used to it and eventually the soundtrack will hype you up during the battle scenes. The voice acting is fine as everyone fit their role. Standouts include Yato\u2019s voice actor for balancing between goofy and serious and Yukine\u2019s voice actor for capturing the teen angst and struggles you would expect of an adolescent boy. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nDespite its many flaws, Noragami is still a fun show to watch. It\u2019s a likable show and it\u2019s easy to see why this was the stand out show of the bland Winter 2014 season. Its got some major holes in the story which may be fixed in the upcoming season, but I wouldn't count on it. I give Noragami a 6/10.\\n",

            "content": "*spoilers*\r\nNoragami is an action adventure with a rich history and characters such as God's, Phantoms, Regalias, and how could you forget the most important a beautiful High School Girl. Our lead character is the 'God of War' named Yato, voice acted by the ever so lovely Hiroshi Kamiya; yes this is only subbed as of now, who wishes to become a very rich and popular God but has to earn his way up 5 yen at a time! which in dollars is ~5 cents. In the very first episode his weapon, Regalia, decides to leave him because of how poor he happens to be, butalso because his hands get really sweaty! \\n\\n\r\nYato takes several jobs as a God in the first episode and amidst the arduous task of finding a lost kitten a girl named Iki Hiyori notices he's about to get hit by a bus and decides to jump to the rescue. Soon after, at the hospital, Yato explains to her how God's cannot be seen and that she herself is special because she can see him. Amidst the confusion of Hiyori's and the job seeking of Yato's they suddenly get under attack, and here our second male lead, Yukine, is spotted and Yato turns him into his new Regalia in the shape of a sword. He is a very annoying character for reasons I will let you find out on your own. \\n\\n\r\nThere are several other God's including Kofuku, Tenjin, Rabo, etc all with there respective Regalia(s). Most of these characters fill in several typical tropes your average anime has and in fact most of the show revolves around battles with these Gods. Yato has a rich history with the Gods and it's one of the bigger themes of the story. This story has no main plot, nothing driving it to keep me hooked to it, and because of that I found it hard continuing it all the way through. I felt as if the story was just going on for the sake of having the story.. go on. The fights were gorgeous and the art was just as gorgeous and it had the music to back it up but the fights were always lacking to me as if they really had no meaning to them; the God would fight Yato because they held some sort of 'past grudge' on him which really seemed like a lame excuse to add these fights in.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't really mentioned much about the female lead Hiyori simply because her character seemed very unneeded. She never developed by any means and was simply there to act as a cheerleader for the male leads, helping them through there troubles, although that might be giving her a little too much credit. There might still be hope for her character because a season two is coming out soon which I look forward to reviewing as well!\\n\\n\r\nOverall mediocre at best! 5/10",

            "content": "Noragami was simply decent, although if someone were to ask me whether I liked it, my answer to that question would lean more towards a \"No, not really\" oriented answer. Quite frankly, this show disappointed me, to say the least. And its unfortunate because I really thought I was going to like this one, but sadly, the hype just didn't cut it for this one. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nDefinitely not the best, and fails to be in many ways. It lacked too many major details, and I found it somewhat choppy in some areas. At first, I liked the whole, \"stray god trying to make it big\"idea, and the first half of the series was manageable, if not, enjoyable, but as it progressed further, I felt myself beginning to lose it. It lacked detail and sophistication, a show that would only be worth posing as a time-killer, just another thing to keep you semi-busy until you can find something more interesting to do. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Visuals: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWasn't too bad, especially since I also watched this on in high quality (I always watch my animes in HD in order to give it's visuals a better judgement). The anime was also filled with many scenic parts, which proved to be beautifully colored and detailed, as well as decent looking effects. However, during most, if not, ALL the fight scenes, the animation dropped by at least 50%. This isn't particularly uncommon in most anime, but that certainly doesn't mean it isn't a problem, especially since this is a shorter series. Most short anime series I've seen lately (ones that have aired around the same time as Noragami) have all managed to keep a steady and nice animation quality, even throughout moments where most animators would get lazy and throw in some half-assed frames or cheap looking CG animation, which is what I saw in this series at many points. Examples of some short series who stayed consistent with crisp looking visuals would be Stein's Gate (well, this one's actually 23, but this only further proves my point), Psycho-Pass S2, Angel Beats, Black Butler S2, and Baccano (this one came out sometime earlier, but I can easily compare its animation qualities to Noragami).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn't too bad either, honestly. It was very unique and had a very nice touch to it. The music in this particular show was quite different form the typical rock-ish J-pop you usually hear. It was mixed with some dubstep qualities and, how should I say it... funk?  which in my opinion is a plus. My favorite track from the series, however, was Harmony. I for some reason really enjoyed it when this particular one was playing, so soothing~\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nHm, I think it's safe enough to say they weren't the best. I mean, as whole, they were funny with the way they interacted, and the the relationship Hiyori and Yato gradually developed wasn't too bad either, especially because it wasn't forced, it made sense, and it was, for the most part, practical. But other than that, I found the cast very mediocre. Many of the problems that arose in this anime were basically the fault of the characters not being able to communicate their feelings in a sensible manner. They were in fact selfish, only thinking about their own needs and what they thought they wanted, without giving a thought of \"Gee, I wonder how 'so and so' feels about me doing this/acting in this way? Maybe I should ask them...\" But in most cases we got, \"I do what I want because I'm 'so and so' or because I deserve 'this and this'. Screw you.\" (this is 110% directed towards the poor relationship Yato and Yukine had among themselves, just so you know. But keep in mind, Yato brought into the show the things that made it watchable, to say the least, and was definitely one the few reasons why I decided to complete the series) If they had just taken the time to tone down their bitching about 'xyz' and just, I don't know, TALK about how to improve their partnership, many of the problems that occurred in the anime would've been solved or prevented, easily. And then there's Hiyori. She was an okay character at first, her being a half-dead phantom and having to pursue (I guess you can say) Yato in order to be changed back to a full human. That was a story line I didn't have many qualms about, but for some odd reason unknown to me, as the series progressed, she was pretty much demoted as a main character to a petty damsel in distress for some villain we only got to know anything about during just the last 2 episodes of the series... hm... how unsatisfying. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then that brings me to the villain, whom I found extremely random and unappealing to the story. Honestly, my reaction to the last-minute introduction of this character was \"Oh look... a random villain with little to no back story appeared... yay.\" It felt so misplaced because the time in which we began hearing even a hint about this Rabou character was, I believe, episode 10 or 11, and this is like what, a 12 episode series. I mean, you've just gotta be kidding me on that one. Not only that, the information we finally learn of him is nothing too special, nothing that would or should make you think his debut was anything to be particularly excited for. Additionally, he was an idiot. Like, I don't know whether it was just a petty pride thing, but for some reason, he was so hell-bent on fighting against his partner after what, hundreds of years, after Yato had clearly moved on and even told him to move on as well. But nah, this Rabou dude decided consuming himself with Ayakashi was a swell idea, which there was no real point in doing. Which then brings us to the ending fight scene, which was also unsatisfying. Yeah, we saw some waterbending and water Jutsu stuff going on, but that was it. We experienced nothing different from Yato, EVEN when he switched to rage mode after Rabou had broken the orb containing Hiyori's memories. I honestly expected Yato to have some hidden ability, something much cooler and unexpected than Rabou's, but all we got was a generic 'last one standing\" ending where the villain was easily defeated, and therefore had no business being a villain in the first place. Villains like that are for kids shows, not more elaborate ones, but then again, this was not an elaborate anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I must also mention Bishamon. Not too sure what her purpose to the story was other than the fact that one of her shinki was killed by Yato, and now wants to kill Yato for doing so. We know nothing about her, her past, and who her deceased shinki even was. She also wasn't given  sufficient enough screen time, which only made me more irritated about trying to figure out who exactly this woman was. But of course, this may have been intended, as a second season may be on the way (whether another one is actually needed is debatable).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the comedy and the visuals of the anime. The comedic aspect of it was childish (sometimes mature), but I laughed, and I tend to have a soft spot for shows that manage to make me laugh, seriously. That's a always a plus. However, that is only the surface, most of the things that went underneath the series in terms of story and characters wasn't very appealing, and these are all important factors that are meant to add to the watching experience, not take away from it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was simply... decent, a show that clearly fell below the hype level. Many aspects of the show seemed bland and unfinished, always building up to some interesting ideas, only for it to be discontinued later on, a reoccurring trait I observed in this series. The characters weren't very interesting and sometimes irritable, and the ending was unsatisfying. But even so, they had great visuals and music, and the series was nonetheless an enjoyable one, even if how enjoyable it was was all the series had to begin with. So fellow denizens reading this review, all I can say to you about this series is, if you have free time with absolutely nothing to do, I guess you can give this one try, just be sure not to expect much, especially if your the type who prefers well thought out, detailed storylines with great characters and supporting details... which Noragami didn't exactly have. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*I apologize for any grammatical errors* \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So, I think it's important to write a review on this, since I may have a perspective that a lot of people don't really have on this one.\r\nNoragami is about Yato, a minor god of calamity who can't get a shrine of his own, and is kind of a bum, who lives with other gods. He also can't seem to keep a servant spirit, because they all run off because he's too poor, and they want a higher lifestyle. Enter Hiyori, a girl who has an accident that causes her to slip in and out of astral travel. This is very dangerous for her, andso she ends up befriending Yato who promises to find a way to save her. Along the way Yato battles lots of demon monsters who are corrupted spirits. \\n\\n\r\nTo many people, Noragami is just another shonen. Battles and action sequences, and some light comedy. And to many people that's all it will be. \\n\\n\r\nBut at it's core, Noragami is a spiritual piece. It contains elements of Buddhist (and Shinto)  teachings that make up the core of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe main premise of this anime is all about the Buddhist concept of Karma, and Sange. Sange is the act of making spiritual contrition: being freed from the burdens of one's mistakes, and harmful acts, by truly being sorry and remorseful.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami, is at it's core, a story about people who do willful, harmful behavior, and then when the karmic burden becomes too great, realize the error of their ways, and truly and sincerely redeem themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an extremely powerful, and deep story in that sense. For many people, they won't get that, they will see gods, and demons, and spirits, and ghosts, and a girl who does astral travel, and think it's all about battles, and another shonen. People have even oddly compared it to Hataraku Maou-sama! (the Devil is a part-timer!) simply because Yato has a part time job. But it's while there are some similarities in the comedy aspects, in Noragami, Yato's \"job\" aspect truly is a very minor, almost glossed over aspect of the story, and the anime itself is about much deeper concepts. \\n\\n\r\nNoragami has a lot of different elements in it. If all you want is action and battles, hey, it has that, and enough to keep you entertained. If you want romance, it has bits of that too. And if you want character development it's loaded with that. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you want something deeper, there is an extremely deep spiritual element too. And that, to me is really the heart of Noragami. All else is just window dressings to provide entertainment. But it's the spiritual development of the characters, and the overall deep spiritual meanings that make this one special.",

            "content": "Up until today, i've never heard of Noragami. It is relatively new but if my friend haden't asked me to watch this with him i probably wouldn't have seen it for a while. That being said i'm glad i took a couple hours of my time to watch the whole first season in one night. I didn't think much of it at first, it looked cool but I personally didn't think it was going to be anything special. This show surprised me ALOT, this a great anime with very little flaws. \r\nStory (9). The story is great, I love how it took time to developthe characters and relationships without sacrificing action or excitement. The drama between the characters worked good as well very rarely being boring. In the first few episodes I thought the show was going to go one way, and it evolved a great deal molding into a fantastic plot without holes. The story picks up quickly as well, getting right to the point in the first episode and then continuing from there. There are no major plot twists, but there are alot of unexpected actions that happen causing my interest to grow. The story takes time to develop the character relationships and still have a central plot point, then in the last few episodes it introduces the main antagonist. At first glance this wouldn't really work well, but when you see the drama between characters you understand why it was structured like this and you see how it actually works. Each episode isn't just about the drama though, episodes typically have excitement and an obstacle for the characters to overcome while progressing the story simultaneously.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (10). Oh lord, this animation was spot on perfect, bones did a fantastic job making the show look gorgeous. All the characters have vibrant colors and unique and pretty designs. The environments look good and clean as well. The CGI effects aren't overused at all and look perfect where ever they're placed. Water and rain effects look fantastic and blend really well with the overall animation. This is a very colorful series, having unique and bright but real looking characters and creatures. The Phantom creatures look bright and beautiful, very unique as well. The action scene choreography is done perfectly and looks very smooth and fluent. Overall the animation is spot on perfect, everything is pretty and interesting to look at while not being over done.\\n\\n\r\nSounds (9). This really goes without saying, the sounds are all crisp clean and very interesting in the case of characters using special powers or other supernatural creatures as well. The soundtrack works very well too, the music binds perfectly with fight scenes and doesn't eclipse the action. The intro and outro songs are very good as well, nothing amazing but they set the tone well and I didn't mind listening to it every episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8). The main characters, Yato, Hiyori, and yukine all worked very well and served as great protagonists. Yato is a very likable guy and is humorous as well. He is also a badass and shows that he truly cares for his friends. Hiyori is very good as well, her voice acting performance was great and she brought alot of emotion and depth to the show. Yukine came off initially as annoying, then he grew on me and by the end I liked him alot. This show does a great job at making you care about all three main characters and being concerned about what happens to them. Another thing the show does well involves the antagonists. Being introduced late in the series normally it would feel like they're shoehorned in. In the few episodes they were there they actually made great villains with a decent back story. They really gave Yato a struggle and the show does a good job at making you hate them. The supporting characters were very good as well, they didn't eclipse the main cast but at the same time they all had great unique personalities and brought a great presence to the show. They all got equal screen time for the most part and they had some funny, intense and subtle moments. It doesn't overcrowd you with a shit ton of supporting cast it nails just the right amount. The show also does a great job at developing the relationship between the main characters, they all have really good chemistry and you really get the sense that they're friends. The relationships evolve and change as well and it's very interesting to see unfold.\\n\\n\r\nI just really liked this anime, it surprised me alot and i was glad with the results. The story had good closure as well and had a good subtle ending. It also gave me excitement for the next season. This show is light hearted and funny but at the same time carries a decent amount of emotion and action at the same time. I wouldn't say it mixes the action and comedy but it does a great job at distinguishing it and at the same time binding it together. The episode endings didn't leave me demanding more but i was very interested with the story.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this show i enjoyed it alot and it was very solid all the way through, if you liked my long review (I'm sorry) please give it a thumbs up (:\\n",

            "content": "Bones and a supernatural shounen? This just might be amazing...\r\nUnlike previous works of Bones that may prompt one to think of the magical works of Fullmetal Alchemist or Zetsuen no Tempest, the concept of Noragami is rather peculiar; it takes the concept of deities and the supernatural, and places it in a shounen atmosphere. Such concepts have nevertheless been done many times before, however, Noragami takes a strange twist on it. Yato is a rather poor god (being a newcomer), and in order obtain respect and fame he must earn it through favors. On his path to fame, he encounters Hiyori Iki, a seemingly randomschoolgirl. Hiyori notices Yato in danger (he isn't usually noticed) and \"pushes him out of the way of a speeding bus; unaware of his status as deity.\" This ultimately causes Hiyori to become a \"half-phantom\" and  thus becomes a major driving factor for the plot in the series. Unfortunately, Noragami (in this aspect) lacks strong plot and premise. There are many inconsistencies that seem to arrive, and many questions unanswered. For example, why was it possible that Hiyori could see Yato in episode 1? The anime itself makes a rather ridiculous example of how deities and phantoms from the \"far shore\" are unnoticable, and later it becomes a huge plot device. Such holes continue when one considers the lack of proper backstory of many side-characters, such as the later revealed incidents with Bishamon, Nora, or even Kazuma. Without a proper amount of content, one has to question their true relevence aside from being plot devices or canon fodder. Unfortunately, Noragami totals at a whopping 12 episodes, so there isn't much time to provide for such things. Luckily, Noragami doesn't take up the challenge of compressing so much into a miniscule amount of episodes, as seen many times before by previous failures. \\n\\n\r\nThe primary focus of Noragami seems to be the characterization of Yato's trio of: himself, Hiyori and Yukine. Because of this, the pacing of the story seems to be quite slow, and one could easily get lost at the shift of plot's goal. The whole thing does seem a bit messy; however, Noragami does manage to maintain great characterization. The driving factor of this anime seems to be Yukine, a wandering spirit who still has regrets from when he was still alive. This is (more-or-less) due to the fact that he died while still young. Upon reunion with the world, his \"regret\" is slowly shaped into \"jealousy,\" and as a spirit, these emotions do not come cheap. These concepts of his \"regrets,\" and the \"punishments\" regarding them really starts to ameliorate the plot; Yato is left with the trial to properly discipline Yukine, while concurrently trying to maintain his own ideals and respect. From this point on, the series itself takes quite a bit of an emotional turn, and the darker pasts and truths of the characters are revealed. Noragami does a great job with the aspect of \"regret,\" and utilizes the supernatural aspect of the anime to further the emotional progression. Unfortunately, Hiyori herself doesn't develop into a substantial character, but fills the role of both an inspiration to the others and an essential advocate. \\n\\n\r\nWhether Bones has done a good job with the animation is quite important, as Noragami is (despite the lack of emphasis of it) an action anime. Ultimately, it seems like Bones really delievered quality content. A good representation of how this is portrayed is shown in the first few minutes of Noragami. A girl named Matsumi is seemingly being attacked (quite reminiscient of schizophrenia), and Yato descends as she pleads help from the gods. Yato slays a rather menacing looking phantom by a means of many flashy jumps and slices. The animation in this scene in particular is very much like many of the other battle scenes in the anime. It's done quite well, and very much gives an impression of a typical shounen with many action scenes. Noragami also suppplies an array of impressive swordsmanship shown throughout the series, delivering what many who were interested in Noragami came to see. Unfortunately, Noragami isn't entirely action, as it seems to be a minor aspect of the series. Most of the anime scenes fail to live up to a continuing expectation of colorful looking phantoms and artsy buildings as seen in the opening. It should also be noted that the consistency isn't regarded too highly in terms of animation, but it's honestly hard to complain when Noragami was produced in 2014.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the opening, the selection of music was quite appropriate throughout the series. After an introduction of various closeups and 3D gimmicks, Yato is seen around a rather surreal city while \"Goya no Machiawase\" plays, a J-rock song that seems to maintain the mood of a typical shounen. The ED in particular, \"Heart Realize,\" a standard J-pop song, captures a much more realistic mood of Noragami; Hiyori is seen searching for Yato and Yukine with an umbrella in a rather frigid, yet exciting atomsphere. Supercell in particular did a nice job of introducing Tia, a young Nico Nico singer. Her voice needs more exposure to the anime industry, as with Noragami, I am now a fan of hers. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, in retrospect, is quite conventional. Yato is voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya, a very credible voice actor who won best  \"Best Lead Actor\" and \"Best Personality\" at the Third Seiyuu Awards. Many viewers may be familiar with his work in Attack on Titan as Levi. The other seiyuus can be held into equal respects, as Maaya Uchida, who acts as Hiyori, won Best New Actress Award in the 8th Seiyu Awards. I'm quite impressed by the voice actors' level of ability, as the amount of emotion needed is essential for success. Without the proper voice acting, it wouldn't be proper to call Noragami a \"tear-jerker,\" while it certainly does hold the title. Unfortunately, the voice acting can only do so much for the series. \\n\\n\r\nNoragami is an anime that had some mediocre plot points, but shapened it up with its great production and characterization. Its pacing is slow, but correct, as it manages to slip in its high points. It's a bit unfortunate that Noragami received only twelve episodes; it could have easily become something special in the anime industry.",

            "content": "I had heard great things about this anime so I decided to give it a shot. I went in with an open mind. Overall I thought the anime was well done but not without it's flaws.\r\nStory: I've mentioned in a previous review the Action/Romance genre dilemma. Basically you get one or the other, rarely both, sometimes none. I feel like both story elements (action and romance) could have been done better. What this anime does have in large quantities is anime-style slapstick comedy. \r\nAction: Most of the action (really until the last episode) is very boring. The main enemies for most of the series areglowing, psychedelic lobsters/crabs/frogs called \"phantoms\". They are poorly drawn and are in no way intimidating or scary. They really serve no purpose other than to pop up and serve as target practice for Yato. To make matters worse, they insist on having Yato recite the same 3-4 line speech before he executes a sword slash (btw, 1 hit kills these phantoms) before cutting to a prolonged death sequence for the phantom. It feels like filler. Two things save the action aspect anime. First there are other struggles besides slaying these mindless drones. These other struggles are interesting but will easily bore someone who wants Attack on Titan or Darker Than Black fight scenes. The second thing the fight at the end. I won't spoil anything but it's actually pretty good and I wish they hadn't waited till the end to introduce it. If they got rid of the giant floating creatures and replaced it with God fights this anime would have rocked.\\n\\n\r\nRomance: The other side to the coin is the romance angle. To be honest, this anime forgot that it was only 12 episodes long. The pacing made Hiyori seem clingy and Yato seem completely aloof until about 3/4 through the season. My biggest problem though comes back to the 12 episode limit. It's really hard to make two characters bond in that amount of time, especially when there is no mutual struggle to bring them together. Basically Hiyori lives a normal life as a student and Yato tries to earn money. No Death game, no Invasion, no Titans. What saved this series is the possibility of a second season and more character development. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Those fucking Phantoms. It's like they lifted the voices from Star Wars and borrowed Jabba the Hut's voice and layered it with a Jawa's. It's really awful. They F'd up  the phantoms. I was also very plus minus on their sound track. The action sequences use this industrial/electronic theme that's unique but imo not too pleasing on the ears.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's Bones so the quality is pretty good. When I said the Phantoms were poorly drawn it wasn't from lack of skill, it was the creature design and style. Maybe it's just me but they looked super silly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I kept an open mind and, despite my complaints, I actually wasn't too disappointed. This is a 12 episode PG-13 anime and it entertained me.",

            "content": "Noragami is a supernatural action series with a hint of romance produced by Studio Bones. Along with Shinichiro Watanabe\u2019s Space Dandy, Noragami signaled the current wave of productivity from the studio in 2014, after a slump of low productivity and shows with lukewarm reception which lasted a few years. While not all the shows in this new wave are gems (or even good), Noragami is a keeper. Though it does stick rigidly close to genre conventions, the show casts a wide range of appeal, and effectively hits every one of its targets. It is frequently funny, continuously engaging, and on rare occasion even a littlecreepy. Most importantly, however, Noragami has a lot of heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when Hiyori, a kind-hearted teenage girl, starts having out of body experiences and meets a down on his luck god named Yato. Where most gods have shrines or attendants, Yato goes around doing odd jobs as a \u2018delivery god\u2019 charging 5 yen for his services. Hiyori requests Yato to find a way to stop her out of body experiences, Yato agrees but says it will be an extended task and will take some time. In the meantime, Hiyori gets drawn further into the world of spirits and gods as she joins Yato and his newly acquired and rebellious Shinki (spirit servant/assistant for lack of better term), Yukine, on their various assignments. All the while, Yato\u2019s dark past is slowly catching up with him.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is a nicely paced, well-rounded show. It deftly switches between action, drama, and comedy on a regular basis, and does a remarkable job keeping the tone consistent even as it shuffles back and forth. The somewhat episodic nature of the show works well to frame the world in which the story takes place, while giving the cast a plenty of time to develop, and allowing the main plotline to slowly reveal itself over the course of the series. The dialogue hits just the right balance of exposition and character interaction, allowing for explanations which further develop this world and how it works, while never really feeling tedious or dry. Dramatic and comedic moments flow naturally, giving a very good sense of who these characters are and how they interact with one another. Even when the show delves into darker material, it usually does not come across as jarring or unnatural, although sometimes a bit forceful and melodramatic. Really, the execution of the plot and all its elements is quite exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nThe strong execution here is very important because the plot, and even characters, in Noragami aren\u2019t anything particularly special on paper. Sure, its world of gods and spirits which exists side-by-side with the world we know is well developed, but it is hardly an original concept. In fact, the setting is one of the most commonly used in the medium of anime; recent shows like Beyond the Boundary and Kami-sama Kiss feature similar settings, and really, they\u2019re only the tip of the iceberg. Having a character such as Hiyori go down the rabbit hole, metaphorically speaking, and entering a world that she is not familiar with is hardly a fresh idea. Neither is Yato\u2019s goofball with a dark past backstory, or half a dozen other plot elements in the show. And yet, the material somehow shines in spite of this. The skillful yet sincere storytelling makes the plot intriguing and emotionally engaging, keeping the viewership invested in the characters and various plotlines even though it is essentially material we\u2019ve seen multiple times before.\\n\\n\r\nMost instrumental to the show\u2019s success is the chemistry between the three leads. Hiyori is a bright, compassionate, and friendly young lady. She\u2019s na\u00efve and unknowledgeable of the mystical world, yet she\u2019s proactive and responsible, always trying to help and understand those around her. In stark contrast is Yato, who seems to be purposely negligent and irresponsible. He\u2019s laidback and only occasionally takes things truly serious, despite his aspiration of being a famous and widely worshiped diety. Unlike Hiyori, Yato can be apathetic to those around him and lets things run their course, even if they lead to disastrous ends. Completing the trinity is Yukine, the confused and defiant spirit of a young teenage boy. Having died at a young age, Yukine is constantly dissatisfied with his situation, and hardly heed the advice and warnings of those around him. He\u2019s also envious of those who have things he does not and cannot have, namely a normal teenage life and friends. These three very different individuals form a makeshift family which is the emotional core of the show. They argue and hurt one another, they console and comfort each other, they have awkward misunderstandings and share laughs. Despite all coming from varied backgrounds and having clashing personalities, there is a genuine connection between the three, one which can sometimes bring them pain, but other times bring them a sense of comfort and acceptance. It\u2019s a connection that is formed through odd circumstances, but one that runs deeper than it might originally appear, and one that the three depend on as the series progresses. The threat of this connection being broken is what makes the antagonists so menacing, and the main plotline so rewarding, even though it is built on a cluster of overused tropes.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is produced by the prolific Studio Bones, and as such, the show looks expectedly stellar for the most part. The character designs have a bi-shounen/bi-shoujo flavor to them, but thankfully have the best aspects of such designs. They\u2019re attractive and expressive designs, and each character has their own distinct body language. The animation is quite good majority of the time, especially during action sequences. There are a few noticeable technical hic-ups and budget restrictions, but overall it is a very good looking show. It sounds just as nice, with well composed music which is implemented effectively. It\u2019s not a soundtrack that is going to stick in your memory or be considered one of the all-time greats, but it supports the show\u2019s content as all good soundtracks should. Likewise, the voice work from the Seiyuu is solid across the board. There isn\u2019t really a performance that stands out as great, but it is an admirable ensemble effort.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Noragami lacks in creativity and originality, it makes up in execution. This is director Koutarou Tamura\u2019s first stab at a full-length TV series, having only directed individual episodes or served as assistant director in various project previously, and it is quite an admirable one. It is clear that the staff behind this project cared about producing a quality work, and they succeeded in doing so. Noragami won\u2019t go down in history as a game-changer or anything of the sort, but as it stands, it is a great genre piece.  \\n",

            "content": "All of us have seen that one series or show or book that didn't seem to know which direction in which it was going. Noragami, however, manages to pull off all of its elements perfectly without even batting an eye. Keep in mind that this is my first review so anything I\u2019m about to say may be incredibly biased or just inexperienced as a whole. With that said, let\u2019s begin.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story of Noragami begins with Hiyori: an average high school girl who has a fated encounter with Yato, a homeless god, but we'll get to them later. Hiyori, being the angel of a personshe is, pushes Yato out of the way of an incoming bus when he suddenly runs into traffic. This results in not only an accident and her being taken to the hospital, but from then on she gains the somewhat troublesome habit of losing her physical body and taking on a similar form, but travels around as her soul seperated from her body. Deciding she can't live on like this, she begs Yato and pays him in advance to restore her back to her original form, and thus, the two connect and Hiyori is abruptly introduced to the world outside of our reality.\\n\r\nAt least, that's what the show would have you believe from its broad overarching plot.\\n\r\nNoragami consists of several plot lines that all mesh in beautifully with each other both in terms of pacing and execution. It wastes no time in moving the story forward, save some of Yato's comic relief and character introductions here and there. It even has some realistic darker undertones thrown in smoothly. They make sure you understand the weight of loneliness and just how invisible those who are not of the living can be, how painful it is to be forgotten and wanting to be remembered. Having read the majority of the manga so far, the anime followed it quite well, had it not been for the filler arc that took up the remaining 3-4 episodes. But for the most part, I enjoyed the story very much and hope that it will follow the manga if it were to receive a second season, which is HIGHLY FAVORABLE. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason why I love the characters of Noragami is not only how diverse they all are, but it seems to have a Hiromu Arakawa feel to it; no character is used solely for fanservice or comic relief in spite of their first appearance. Every person in this series is well fleshed-out, developed, and not one-dimensional in the slightest, though that's what you may get the impression of in early episodes. \\n\r\nYato, our main character, is somewhat of an underdog aside from being homeless and having a strange fashion sense. He is definitely the real propeller of the show, providing us with not only mystery, insight, and of course, more comic relief than you can shake a stick at, but just such a fun time watching him in general. There wasn\u2019t a moment I didn\u2019t appreciate his presence on my screen. What\u2019s not to like about a bratty, teenage looking god taking up job requests for only 5 Yen? Much about him is still to be revealed, though they\u2019ve given us enough to go on for right now. His viewpoints on humans and life as a whole is somewhat irritating yet fascinating due to his experience of both and naturally, having lived for thousands of years as a vicious war god who has somehow faded to an insanely silly and docile version of that is still unkown. But to end his profile, Yato is a great character who differs from the typical shonen hero who still has plenty of development to go and is an amazing joy to watch at any given time. And personally, my favorite character of the series, so bias warning there.\\n\r\nNext up is Hiyori. I definitely don\u2019t have as much to say here, as she is a pretty bland character until she meets Yato and gets caught up in the world of gods and evil spirits. Before that she is just the average high school student who goes to school with her friends, has a loving and rich family, and is just normal overall. Her most defining trait is without a doubt, her extreme levels of kindness that most female protagonists seem to ooze with these days (hence the reason why she pushed a complete stranger out of the way of an oncoming bus because she\u2019s a female and therefore is /just /that /nice.) But of course, she isn\u2019t simply that customary for no given reason. Her main purpose is to serve as more of a window into the hidden reality we see that is so different from our daily lives, since she lives the everyday life that most of us do either as well or similarly to a fair extent. She reflects more of the confusion and shock the average human being would feel upon having a million revelations thrown into her face via Yato, and I suppose if you really don\u2019t care for her she could be more of a wish-fulfillment character into an alternate universe. Unlike other leading characters, she\u2019s determined and knows when to take the initiative when the situation is tight. But alas, she starts out as the badass female lead and then ends up getting damseled like some million-dollar-prize in the last couple episodes, which I hate with the burning passion of a million suns. But moving on. \\n\r\nLast of the main three is Yukine, Yato\u2019s sarcastic, stubborn fourteen-year-old Regalia who serves as his weapon for 98% of the show and also adds some more comic relief to (but mainly against) our poor underdog god. Out of those already mentioned above, he undeniably undergoes the most drastic character development in the entire show and /all of it/ is so, so, so satisfying. It surprises me how much hate he gets from the fandom, though not only is that a) more personal bias, b) not the time to bring this up in a review, and c) a time to complain about the fandom giving him crap, but I thought all of it was well justified, mainly because it is so simple to see what it is he wants, where he\u2019s coming from, why he wants all these things that he can never have. Plus he actually acts similarly to how an actual fourteen-year-old boy with raging hormones and inner angst would. The show finally starts to get into a rhythm of a plot with his introduction, which is majorly important as well. The only complaint that I would have is that I felt that the episodes just took a /little/ too long having the buildup to his extremely Paramount conclusion, though it was so intensely satisfying in the end that I completely forgot about it. It added a sense of desperation to the entire thing, which, when I think about it, is not necessarily a bad factor now. But of course, since he is a part of this show, he is a brilliant and extremely adorable character to watch if you can understand him, which should not really be a problem at all. \\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast is also great, each to their own with their own stories, pasts, and different sides, but are all also incredibly fun to watch as they give the show so much colour and variety. The only reason why I wouldn\u2019t give the character aspect a full-on 10 is because of Yato\u2019s rather-late-introduced arch-nemesis from thousands of years ago (who just happens to be a filler character because of the unfortunately short length of this series right now) and Hiyori\u2019s demotion of \u201cPrize to Be Won After We Win Because we Love Her\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI definitely don\u2019t have any complaints here. For the most part the animation style is typical Bones fare, with the art looking approvingly alike to that of the manga\u2019s. Each character design is bright and interesting to the eye, from Yato\u2019s cat-like blue eyes and strange scarf to the brighter colours of the giggly Kofuku and the other personified gods. Scenery is also well done and detailed, though I wish there were more fight scenes included because this is where the animation /really/ shines through. (Yato\u2019s Rend attack in particular, and mainly since this little cut is re-used multiple times in each episode.) Naturally there are times when the quality would dip here and there, but it does its job and doesn\u2019t fail to please. Solid 8 here. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Noragami was composed by Taku Iwasaki, the genius who had previously created OSTS for the famous Black Butler and Soul Eater, both of which were known for their very prominent themes varying from rock ballads and pop to Victorian-era themes. Most of the music is light-hearted and a bit repetitive in its loops, but it sets the mood extremely well and never feels out of place. It occasionally mixes in a few classical Japanese themes into it too, and that never feels unnatural either. The battle music is the main point in this entire OST along with a few other tracks that will make you go, \u201cOh, this played when ______ happened and it sounded awesome!\u201d because honestly it is just that great. No complaints. \\n\r\nAs if it could possibly add onto the already existing 10, the voice acting of Noragami is simply SUPERB and there is no other way I can say it. The casting of the actual god Kamiya Hiroshi as Yato was an absolutely perfect choice that would be practically impossible to imitate by anyone else. I wasn\u2019t used to hearing him play such a wide range in a single role, but I have faith in that man. I got used to it, and he was simply amazing. In fact, even if I didn\u2019t have any interest in Noragami\u2019s story I would still watch this anime just because this guy is present in the cast. I don\u2019t even think I need to mention Yuki Kaji, but I will anyway just for the fact that he pulls of Yukine\u2019s pre-teen angst and personality so intensely well that I almost burst out sobbing the second he spoke a single line. Both of them are really what pull off the characters and that goes for the rest of the cast too. Having seiyuu regulars such as Sawashiro Miyuki, Fukuyama Jun, and Daisuke Ono were all great choices as well, and again, no complaints at ALL. Don\u2019t even talk to me about the OP and ED. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Final Verdict: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, even though I\u2019d like to call it as such, Noragami is not perfect, as is anything else out there. But though it has its problems, I was never once bored or dissatisfied with this show to a large extent. The only thing that would make this bump up to a ten would be the confirmation of more to come. Though the anime had its happy (if not rushed) ending, there is still so much manga content to be animated, including the /incredible/ arc focusing on Bishamon, Yato\u2019s other arch-nemesis from centuries ago, but now\u2019s not the time to mention that. Noragami is a great blend of comedy and the supernatural, a character-driven show that really gets you to feel and has a tone that tends to capture. Beneath it all are underlying tones of darkness and grief, but still manages to put on a lighthearted tone when it needs to. But all in all, I had a great time watching the ride and grew attached to it. This anime will most definitely have a little reserved corner in my heart as one of the greatest animes of the Winter 2014 season and I\u2019m looking forward to the possibility of a future season. And with that, I leave you. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cMay our fates intertwine.\u201d \\n\\n",

            "content": "I, like most everyone on this planet, like things.\r\nThe things that I like come in many different shapes and sizes. One such thing that I like is the Winter 2014 show Noragami, a 'feels' shounen brought to you by Studio Bones, that brings together elements of shows like Soul Eater and Rurouni Kenshin to give you a 'family-centric' journey exploring what it means to be alive. \r\nOr rather I wish it did. At its best you've got tear jerking moments of mortality, family, and the struggles of existence. You have a cast of characters you care about, the voice acting encapsulating each character almost perfectly,flowing between emotions and the changing tone beautifully. At its worse you have long 'bouts of 'struggle of the week'. Slow buildup to something with mediocre story telling until the conclusion. And foreshadowing that is either so obvious it hurts, or massively fascinating and never really answered.\\n\\n\r\nThis show's strengths are in its characters, mainly Yato - who consistently brings out the best interactions of the entire show, be it his sweetness or his harshness - and are the primary reason that I want more and more of Noragami. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the cast are all better than average. Certainly better than what I expect from a battle shounen. And when the show is being a harsh drama I am utterly entranced, fulfilled and cathartic.\\n\\n\r\nBut. When it is not being amazing. It is mediocre beyond belief. Slow pacing, which ,whilst forwarding the overall plot, could easily have been something else more in line with the show at its best. This is further exemplified by the animation quality which just seems disappointing. The art style deserves better than what it got. The art style on its solid and certain 'Phantoms' (The primary antagonistic beings for most of the series) just ooze awesome. Others look about as cool as a blue frog can look. And whilst I couldn't call the animation terrible, for the most part it does nothing good, the creepiness is not exemplified, the sadness is not exemplified, the little details are simply absent. I'm never impressed and at my worse I'm disappointed by how often the shounen \u201cPower up to kill shit\u201d is copy and pasted. Sure it is cool the first couple of times, but with the amount it is reused it loses its power quickly. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack takes some interesting steps. Using more electronic and dubsteppy tracks than your standard rocky shounen. I personally found it kind of bland, but I can easily see others enjoying it far more as the tracks are not out of place and certainly match the moods of the scenes. Being unique in this regard should be applauded, but whether it really works or not is something we can question heavily.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the biggest and most substantial flaw of this show is where the overall plot goes. This is a 12 episode series that does not buckle down and focus. Most of what fascinated me in the earlier episodes was not really built upon. Instead I have a Kenshin-esque fight scene and a re-establishment of the strange 'friend-family-esque' trio, which was only broken up an episode earlier. I want more exploration of Yato and Yukine's character depth and backstory. I want my weird romance subplot between a kinda human and a deity. I want the three main plot lines to be resolved. \\n\\n\r\nBut I don't have that. Instead I'm left here waiting and hoping for a season two that takes everything amazing about this show and continues, without the flaws of the first season. Which in itself is an issue, because the ending track is completely and utterly gorgeous. Easily amongst one of the best EDs, based on track alone, that I have had the fortune to listen to in my lifetime. But a single music track alone is not something most people will watch a show for.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Lacking both recognition and a shrine, Yato (Kamiya, Hiroshi) is a god down on his luck, forced to take on mundane requests in order to earn his meager offerings. On one of these menial tasks he is rescued from the path of a racing truck by Iki Hiyori (Uchida, Maaya) who subsequently is subjected to inconvenient out of body experiences when her soul leaves her body. After Hiyori requests for Yato to fix her condition they meet Yukine, (Kaji, Yuuki) a wandering spirit who becomes Yato\u2019s divine weapon. The three fight ayakashi and do odd jobsin order for Yato to one day become a recognizable god with both a shrine and followers.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nNoragami has a fairly small cast which can be nice in terms of simplicity however it can also lead to the show feeling over-reliant on only a few characters. Yato, the penniless god who dreams of becoming a well-respected deity, is a fairly lighthearted and comedic character however is perfectly capable of becoming serious given the proper conditions. He\u2019s not afraid to take on simple jobs in order to earn his 5-yen donations however I also felt that this trait was somewhat troublesome as the character has high aspirations but only progresses towards them at a snails pace.\\n\\n\r\nIki Hiyori is a generic enough school girl (outside of her interest in professional martial-arts). She isn't a very intricate or even interesting character however her place in the show is well situated enough as she acts as a sort of layman for the viewers so we can have an introduction to the implications and concepts of Noragami\u2018s world. She is a good source of comedy however I don\u2019t think she holds much intrigue within the story.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we have Yato\u2019s divine weapon: Yukine. He was a wandering spirit when Yato found him and by nature of this was once human which makes for a good deal of the shows drama as well as Yukine\u2019s own internal anxiety. I found him to be rather irritating as a character \u2013 it is eluded to that he had a tragic or traumatic past as a human however his conflict with Yato and his lot in the show is not tied to this and therefore feels needlessly whiny and unpleasant. He is often at odds with Yato however there didn't appear to be any unique character qualities within Yukine that would give way for this and so his discomfort feels petty. He doesn't exhibit very good character development either and while he does become less unpleasant after a point, it is not even his own doing that leads to this near 180 of attitude. All in all, I felt he was rather annoying and I thought his poorly written character exploration took up much too much time.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs in Noragami are fairly simple except when it comes to the more supernatural characters like other gods or the ayakashi \u2013 Yato himself is best visually characterized by wearing a jersey and sweat pants. The character designs tend to get a little relaxed or lazy if the scene is not of great import or when the characters are depicted as far away however they never become outright terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe combat in the show could almost entirely be described as single-strike or clash based because many of the battles are between Yato wielding Yukine against an otherworldly monster. This isn't necessarily bad however if one was to look into the show for action reasons then these scenes leave a bit to be desired in terms of choreography, length, and overall complexity.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nI think this is where Noragami falls short for most people \u2013 not because the story is poorly written or because the characters act stupid but because there doesn\u2019t seem to be much there to begin with. The premise of the story \u2013 that Yato wishes to become a famously worshiped god and that Hiyori wants her body fixed \u2013 is not something that the story spends much time chasing after. Yes, Yato takes odd jobs in order to increase his recognition and earn his offerings however, as I stated in the [Characters] section, he seem to have much actual ambition and therefore hardly progresses towards his dream within the course of the 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe content that the show actually covers, concerning primarily Yukine\u2019s emotional disposition and later Yato\u2019s dark history, I didn't find as interesting as if the show pursued its original premise more actively. In all honesty, because the show is primarily lighthearted for a good deal of its episodes, I would say that the comedic interactions between the main cast of characters is ultimately of more interest than the plot the show shallowly explores.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music was pretty good and some people may recognize a similar approach and style as to that of Katanagatari as the composer is Iwasaki Taku. I wouldn't say that the music is nearly as good as his other work in my personal opinion however I would say the soundtrack is one of the show\u2019s better appeals. The music mostly occupies a BG-type quality whereas Iwasaki\u2019s work normally takes more of a center stage role in my experience \u2013 the action scenes do play up the music accordingly so I generally enjoy these parts of the music more than others.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nWhile there is a second season now confirmed for Noragami, these 12 episodes felt forgettable to me. The characters weren't very interesting and there were so few of them that the cast of the show felt pretty lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 5\\n\\n\r\nI gave the show a 5 because its well enough animated and has decent music but the show spent its 12 episode run quite poorly in the progression department and had a few actively annoying elements such as Yukine\u2019s dialogue and characterization.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nBecause the show offers very little in overall content \u2013 I have a hard time recommending the show to anyone for genre purposes however someone that\u2019s looking for a supernatural anime would not go amiss as the ayakashi and gods are fairly present throughout the show. The action in Noragami i felt was pretty lackluster save maybe the final confrontation in the show however I don\u2019t think it was a worthy payoff and wouldn't recommend it for this reason. I would say that the show\u2019s strongest point is its comedy and so anyone looking for a good few comedic reaction faces and decent gags would do fine in watching the show however there is a fair amount of drama as well so its not a pure comedy by any means.",

            "content": "This is one of the few anime I got to watch with my brother all the way until the end, which is quite the rare feat. It isn't all that surprising, however. If you read the summary or watched the show already, you know its plot and characters show potential, or that it at least is serviceable/enjoyable.\r\n... Serviceable it was indeed, but it's nothing more than that quality-wise. The plot is basically about this chick named Hiyori saving a guy from a car accident but in the process, becoming half-dead (her soul can leave her body and all that jazz). That guy turns out tobe a minor god named Yato who wants to have his own shrine with many followers one day by doing all sorts of services in exchange for five yen each. Wanting him to turn her back to normal, Hiyori sticks to him because she has to remind the guy that he needs to solve her problem practically every time she sees him.\\n\\n\r\nWell, when you get down to it, this conflict stops having any actual importance a few (2 or 3, I think) episodes later, so uh, no wonder Yato basically shrugs it off. Anyway, gods apparently need these spirit things called Regalias to cut down phantoms and basically be their personal servants, which is where the third protagonist Yukine (can also be Yuki or Sekki because these Regalias apparently have three different names for some reason) comes in to become Yato's Regalia. The story follows these three characters, and the conflicts they go through together... or... something like... that... Pfft.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, right. You're at first made to think the focus is gonna be on Hiyori and Yato, and trying to get her back to normal, but that's a ruse. Instead, Hiyori turns into thin air and acts on nothing despite her initial actions making you think she'd be a decent girl protagonist and Yukine's problems become the focus of the show for way too many episodes, especially when you consider the fact that it all could have been solved if Yato and Yukine just bothered talking to each other about said problems. However, how could there be the magnificent/pointless thing called misunderstandings if they just talked to each other like normal people? I mean, Yato's not technically a person anyway, am I right? \\n\\n\r\nI wasn't asking for the story to be about taking down phantoms, the recurring monsters that influence people on bad levels that only the people on the Far Shore (aka the afterlife) can see, and figuring out how to get Hiyori back to normal: in hindsight, focusing on creatures with no character or depth whatsoever would make for a dull episodic format, which I wouldn't want. However, I also wasn't asking for it to go in this strange direction, all the way until episode 9 at that! The problem with this, if you put aside the bit of stupidity present, is really just the fact that it takes up the majority of the show, and not that it's focusing on a character, or that character in particular: focusing on him is great and all, but I also wanted focus on other characters throughout the anime, like, I dunno, Hiyori (too much to ask out of the show).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, after that, you're introduced to the final arc (I guess: if you consider the beginning to be one arc, and the Yukine part another, then this would be the last arc in the anime), where there's a fairly dramatic conflict caused by a villain that challenges the friendship formed between the three protagonists. Sounds good, right? Even better, you see that no matter what methods are used, this dramatic conflict doesn't get solved so easily, and instead, the villain has to be confronted in this great climax of a final fight and episode. Hyped, aren't you (if you aren't, just roll with it!)?\\n\\n\r\n... Let me tell you why this didn't work:\\n\\n\r\n- There's this character cooperating with the villain who has clear ties to Yato's background and seems really important overall, and yet you get to know nothing about her. At all. Even though you can basically attribute the good dramatic part of this arc to her, you don't see anything about her!\\n\\n\r\n- The villain himself is mediocre. Serviceable, even, like the whole show. Even though he was somewhat hyped with stuff like the opening and whatnot, he's really as generic as you can get. Needless to say I was disappointed, as you'd expect someone more... important or grand from the villain that shows up at the end. You could replace him with a different guy with an equally generic backstory and nothing would really change;\\n\\n\r\n- The fight's not very interesting. It's basically sword fighting, with no noteworthy moves and, well, it's emotional and, uh, um, power-ups, I guess (the pinacle of fine writing). Seriously, the people behind this anime even bothered to put a PANTY SHOT in the midst of the final episode (possibly the most pointless panty shot in the world, by the way, and panty shots are practically pointless to begin with), and it's not like Noragami is littered with fanservice or anything like that! It can make up for not being anything special by the stakes being high (making things more emotional and getting you to care about what's happening), which they were... somewhat. If you care about the characters, that is. Besides, you can't really care about the action when...\\n\\n\r\n- The resolution of the conflict and climax is just stupid. As in, devoid of intelligence, yes. I can even give you examples: Yato is very, very early on established to being able to teleport. He teleports a fair amount of times in the show. He tends to scare Hiyori with this from appearing so suddenly! Teleporting is a total thing with Yato. And yet, Yato doesn't teleport at the very end, when it's needed most, to save a really important x that's on the verge of falling (avoiding spoilers as much as possible), basically dooming what he was trying to save in the first place. Why? Because consistency, man: this show has it in spades, I guess. The stupidity doesn't end here, however: I'm just gonna tell you straight up that every method used to try to solve this conflict, which were legitimate attempts, apparently pales in comparison to the CLEARLY much more meaningful solution of \"I can smell dudes!\". Not even joking (beyond the sarcasm). And that's when the situation's seemingly hopeless in every aspect! Like, are you freaking kidding me?!\\n\\n\r\nIn general, when it comes to the plot of Noragami, my brother even goes as far as to say that \"It's like the show was passed around ten different people\" (basically, that it's all over the place) and you can kind of see what he's talking about. It's first about gods and phantoms and Hiyori's problems (somewhat), but then it starts being all about Yukine, and afterwards it shifts its focus 100% to Yato and gods and the final stuff with their friendship. If you think about it, phantoms are basically irrelevant to the final arc, Yukine's stuff is irrelevant to the first arc, and Hiyori herself becomes irrelevant for a good chunk of the show. They just have no connections whatsoever with each other, so it really feels like certain details get suddenly forgotten along the way for no reason whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I could sort of sense (with shipping goggles) Yato/Hiyori shipping coming with the show, my brother and I legit got misled into thinking Hiyori/Yukine was gonna be a thing midway to the point where my brother got confused when this turned out not to be the case at all. Despite these direction problems, you do end up being behind the developments of Noragami: it's that serviceable. Part of that's because of the equally serviceable cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nYato is a likable, cheerful guy, and a lot of humor comes from him. He wants to be well-known, and us, the viewers, want to see that happening too. He's also mysterious in the sense that there's a lot of backstory to him that we don't know, and that he's not devoid of a serious side. However, we don't get to know anything truly relevant about Yato's past in this anime beyond the fact that he has many female acquaintances and that he killed stuff or whatever (totally unexpected of a god of war, huh?). Not only that, but his serious side wasn't what you'd call meaningful: it just seemed like it was there for the sake of being there, as in, \"Ooooh no, I'm serious, you can't get close to me!\". You know, that sort of thing that easily gets brushed off.\\n\\n\r\nYukine's also not that bad of a character. You can't expect him to be rainbows and sunshine when he's a spirit who's died at a young age, after all. It's just that he was the victim of that middle arc, which I can imagine got many people annoyed with him. Sure, he's not that likable when he basically acts all mean towards Yato and whatnot, but it's not like he's insufferable, and he does fit in with the cast alright.\\n\\n\r\nHiyori's another problem entirely. She's shown to be fairly spirited (badum-tss), with an interest in wrestling and overall a personality you can get behind. This goes as far as to have her copy a move from her favorite wrestler to take down a phantom at the very first episode! Sadly, you don't see any of this afterwards. Instead, she just happens to be 'there' for the rest of the show. You can understand why this is the case: she has no ties with the stuff happening; only Yato and Yukine do. Even so, that doesn't excuse the striking flaw of making a pointless protagonist: when you have a protagonist, they have to have some sort of tie with the events of the story, some role, or at least participate in something.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Hiyori doesn't do anything special until final episodes, though you could argue she actually doesn't do much there either seeing as it's still Yato saving the day and she's basically a damsel in distress. While I also can't call her a wasted potential because she's not amazing or anything of the sort, she was definitely poorly-handled. I'd literally get surprised whenever Hiyori had some semblance of focus in the middle of the show, like, \"Oh, wait, she isn't being thin air now?\". It was pitiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are alright, I guess. They weren't explored all that much, like a lot of the actually interesting stuff going on in the show related to Yato. After all... everything is tied to Yato. Might as well call the show 'Yatogami', am I right? Overall, the character cast is nothing special as far as I could tell from watching the show. Like the story, it's likable, enjoyable and serviceable.\\n\\n\r\nThe same applies to the art and sound. The art looks pretty good, and some of the designs for the phantoms were somewhat creepy, along with the voices they'd have. The character designs are also good, and the animation's not bad at all. The opening's pretty cool to listen to, but I personally didn't really like the rest of the soundtrack. The techno-ish, japanese style-ish sounds with some dude singing out vowels just did not appeal to me (with this, I'm referring to the more prominent tracks). Even so, I can't say it didn't fit the anime. When it comes to voice acting, Hiroshi Kamiya did a good job as always, Yuki Kaji was chosen for an unfortunate role as always and Hiyori\u2019s voice was somehow growing to annoy my brother. In other words, it was good, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the criticism I throw at it, my brother and I were enjoying Noragami a fair amount: though I knew it'd be worthy of a 5 (which doesn't count as a negative score to me) from the get-go, I didn't have a terrible time watching it. Even my brother, who doesn't watch anime all that much and drops anything if the tiniest thing doesn't appeal to him, wanted to see it through to the end, which is definitely saying something about how enjoyable it is to watch, and not in that 'so bad it's good' way. Instead, Noragami is the kind of show you enjoy in that 'turn your brain off and it's a masterpiece' way, and there's nothing wrong with that. After all, it is really serviceable.\\n\\n\r\n... Seeing something yet? Like me hammering the fact that Noragami's serviceable? Because that's really the point of the review. To point out that Noragami's an alright show. That it's enjoyable, likable, 'meh'. There's nothing really deep you get out of it, and you don't have to either. It doesn't convey anything truly meaningful or absolutely breathtaking, but that's fine: you can pass time with this anime. The story's enjoyable, the characters are likable, the production values are pretty nice, and it's overall a serviceable, 'meh' show. There's nothing in it that makes me feel anything more. But that's not what I can call a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nSo, well, I suppose I'd recommend this to basically anyone as a way to kill time. It can appeal to a lot of people, after all. I mean, it's even got a second season now... which I'll never watch. Though I've originally written the review before such an announcement was even made, I decided to re-write it since its writing quality wasn't good enough, in my opinion, to get my points across. Let's hope it's actually better now. Either way, I can imagine that Noragami won't fail to deliver the same quality with its second season, so if you really liked this show, you might as well give that a try. \\n\\n\r\nServiceable it was indeed, but serviceable never hurt anyone.",

            "content": "Thunder's Review no.1: Noragami\r\nIt seems that Noragami caught attention of many this winter season, witch is understandable based on the fact that it's produced by studio Bones, famous for their rather high production values. Additionally being an adaptation of rather famous manga certainly make it a high priority show for many. Is Noragami really worth attention it gets from the community? Well, it is definitely enjoyable show but it have its share of problems that keep it from being really good.\r\nThe Story 5/10\r\nIn world of Noragami gods exist and walk the earth in secret. Just as in human society some have it better than others.There are those who have legions of followers and many shrines dedicated to them and those lesser gods that have to run around as errand boys to require believers. Our main protagonist, war god Yato ranks among the latter. Day by day Yato bravely hunt hollows (monstrosities born of human suffering) and brush toilets clean for a low price of 5 yen per wish. One day he stumbles upon a girl named Iki Hiyori and saves her life. By doing so Yato grubbed her soul out of her body and she became a half hollow. And so our favorite war god try to help Hiyori get back to normal. Of course things get complicated on the way. Hiyori gets introduced to different gods and a whole different world alien to her.\\n\\n\r\nThe story have some interesting concepts, mostly surrounding Yatos past but many things are just introduced to us just to be left out in the dark later on. Noragami obviously suffers from the same problem as other manga adaptations, parts of the story are just being left out of the anime or simply didn't get there yet. The ending is not that great either and do a poor job on summarizing everything up and giving us a decent conclusion. Still, story have some value to it. It's interesting enough to keep you engage so you can enjoy the rest of what this show have to offer. It also include some good morals you can keep with you as you leave the show behind if you care for that sort of things. I know that I do to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of studio Bones Noragami is beautifully animated. Movements are fluid, light effects flashy and backgrounds full of details. Of course fight scenes are parts when the animations are on their best. Even comedy parts of the show keep up the high quality of animation. Also I have to give a praise for character designs they are quite memorable, mostly thanks to colour contrasts. There are just few short moments when animation quality drops for a moment and they are not easily found.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack in Noragami is different from what you will hear in other shows. It have original sound to it. There are few trucks that stand out witch of my favorite is Noratan, it appear to pump up atmosphere when something epic is about to happen. Just listen to it:\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOpening is very good, both when it comes to song(performed by \"Hello Sleepwalkers\") and the animation. In fact when I watched opening first time I thought that it was animated by SHAFT and that it's saying something about its quality. Ending was all right (girls with umbrellas getting really popular nowadays).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also top quality featuring some of the best in the industry. Even Mr. Fukuyama known mainly for his role as Lelouch in Code Geass voiced one of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of interesting characters present, sadly we don't get to know much of their past. Even when they are members of the main cast. Nonetheless most of the characters are charismatic and fun to watch. Everybody of the main cast goes through bigger or lesser development. It's rushed, it's forced but it's their. Hopefully we'll get second season that will explain backstory of the key characters more, or I would be forced to read manga. When I think about it, it doesn't sounds that bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nThanks to great production value, decent comedy, amazing fight scenes and overall coolness of the show I enjoyed it quite a lot. If we would just get good conclusion at the end it would be great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nNoragami turned out to be a decent show, definitely worth few hours of my cold winter evenings. When it's failed to give us story with good conclusion its high production values and overall coolness make it enjoyable to watch.",

            "content": "Noragami Full Review\r\nHave you ever felt that you wanted an anime with relatable and well-written characters, coupled with an interesting story filled with action and comedy? Well, look no further, because Noragami is here.\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nNoragami\u2019s story, I would have to say, be a rather unique one. I say so because the anime spends a lot of time in the beginning introducing you to the characters, and make you wonder, just where is the main story? When are they going to get on with it? However, that\u2019s where this anime shines. The overarching story has been there the whole time \u2013 blended well with the characterdevelopments, which provides an even stronger impact when it reaches the climax. So, what is Noragami mainly about? I would say that it is the relationships between our characters, and what they did to solve them. Why did I give the story a 9 out of 10, then? This is because of how relatable these stories are, and of course the valuable lessons it has taught us \u2013 Appreciate what you have.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nI have one word for Noragami\u2019s main cast and side cast: \u201cAmazing\u201d. This was perhaps one of the few anime where the cast support and play off each other so well, that makes it not only seem realistic, but also a joy to watch as well. Not forgetting, the characters by the end of the series have totally changed from what they used to be in the first episodes.\\n\\n\r\nYato is a God who doesn\u2019t have a shrine built for him, and so grants people wishes for 5 yen, in hopes that one day, he\u2019ll finally get enough money to built a shrine for himself. In the anime, Yato is more like a fatherly figure to all of the other characters. Sure, he fools around, but he always does what\u2019s best for the group, even though his reasons are not seen immediately. That\u2019s just like how a father is, isn\u2019t it. One who doesn\u2019t always seem to be there with you but supporting you quietly.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Yato is like a fatherly figure, Hiyori is the motherly figure. I would say that she is the exact opposite to Yato. She looks at things mostly on the surface, but she is always there to support both Yato and Yukine, often reprimanding them for their actions. But why is this so? It\u2019s because she cares for them, just like a mother would. Additionally, in the beginning of the anime, most people would think that Hiyori would be this damsel in distress; basically a useless character that needed saving by the guys. However, this is not the case, as we see she can capably handle herself in fights, and sometimes even be the one to help out both Yukine and Yato.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be spending a little bit more time to talk about Yukine. I would say that Yukine is probably the most controversial character in the series. There has been a lot of hate towards him, but I\u2019ll have to say that the hate is unjustified. Why? Yukine is a teenager. Merely a 13-year-old boy. Of course by that age he would know from right and wrong, but from 13 to 18 years of age, it is known as the rebellious age. You know what is right and wrong, but you still commit the wrongdoings anyway. Why? Because it is fun to disobey the rules. Rules are meant to be broken, right? Everyone, or almost everyone has been in this stage before (unless you\u2019re under 13 of course). That is why Yukine was acting the way he was. However, the problem kicks in when his rebellious nature is coupled with the longing to belong somewhere. This is yet another trait of the teenagers. In school, just as Yato mentions, everyone wants to be popular right? Everyone wants to have the most friends. The point here is that Yukine is dead, and he cannot interact with them. Yet the living, which can have almost everything and anything that Yukine doesn\u2019t, complain and do not appreciate it. Chasing after something he can never obtain\u2026 That is what made Yukine lose his mind. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks really beautiful. You can notice this especially with the character designs (just look at Yato\u2019s eyes) and during the fight scenes. The destruction of the phantoms after Yato\u2019s killing blow looks amazing. I do have one little gripe though, they reuse the same animation when Yato does his final move every episode. Yes, I get that that\u2019s because it's the same move, but it would be great if they could vary that up a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great since it matches every scene perfectly, whether it being a scary scene, or action scene. I have to give credit to the phantom\u2019s voices, for being so creepily fitting. Of course, our voice actors are amazing as well, being able to bring both the comedy and serious voices when they are required.\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening and Ending are both really, really good; There\u2019s no way you\u2019d want to skip that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I have with Noragami, is perhaps the wait every week. Just as something interesting was about to happen, the episode ends.  In other words, I enjoyed it immensely. This is mainly because they know when to inject comedy, and when to make it serious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is a really amazing anime. It not only provides great characters, but awesome stories that are highly relatable. Coupled with beautiful art and soundtrack, this anime is a must watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever needed help with something from a higher being? Was there ever a moment where you decided to seek help because you couldn\u2019t get the task done yourself? There\u2019s an answer to that now: Delivery God Yato. The catch is that he does require a fee for his services. Yet, the guy gets his hands dirty to the point and is the solution to your problems.\r\nAt first glance, a series about a God trying to be a deity of worship seems something that\u2019s hard to take in by heart. Rather, Gods are usually depicted as being powerful, omniscient, and shines with brilliance. That\u2019s what Yatotries to be anyways someday. As someone who is barely known in the real world community, he\u2019s far from that. Yato\u2019s job of helping others for a price as a God is something that doesn\u2019t seem so appealing at first. His goal is apparently to build a shrine of worship and have his name being recognized by everyone. He doesn\u2019t have many followers nor does he have the ability of omniscience. Yet, he does have the ability to draw attention towards him, especially Hiyori Iki, a high school student who almost witness him get into a car accident. Fate has it for them when Hiyori saves him but not without her life being changed forever. \\n\\n\r\nBy traditional standards, high school girls saving a supernatural being isn\u2019t new to the anime industry. Yet, Noragami shines with its own charms on various terms. For instance, we have a young girl who is selfless, brave, and eager to help others in need. She puts others before herself and her actions often speak louder than words. Despite her life being seemingly changed forever, she doesn\u2019t blame anyone for it but rather hope to use her new abilities to continuously help others. This brings her in terms with the n narcissistic God, Yato. Their relationship is odd at first with the duo often complaining and arguing about seemingly events of little importance. Despite that, they are surprisingly entertaining to watch in particular Yato. He makes the time fly fast with his characteristics as a God by helping others but not without a price. (Charging 5 yen for a completed task) It stands out for the fact that Yato helps others for his own personal gain rather than just \u2018doing the right thing\u2019. With this set up, you can guess why Yato and Hiyori often gets into debates. These are often comical because in some ways, they are compatible. Hiyori is no shadow to be stepped on despite her kindness. She is able to stand up for herself and take responsibilities. Similarly, Yato has a natural sense of humor with a sense of himself. Sometimes, his behavior reflects human emotions such as regret, jealousy, and solitude. Despite being so different, Yato and Hiyori has a special relationship viewers will feel attached to.\\n\\n\r\nOn other hand, there\u2019s one character where viewers will find less appealing at first and hard to get used to. Meet Yukine, a wandering spirit that Yato made into a weapon for his job. To appreciate Yukine will be difficult as he acts just like his age as a brat. He isn\u2019t mature for someone his age and neither does he have a tolerable sense of humor. Despite being a spirit, he acts like a human such as his perverseness, curiosity, and even suffers from kleptomania. It is somewhat acceptable at first to understand where he came from \u2013 a child whom missed the opportunity of a normal life as evidenced by some flashbacks. Yet, his present actions does not constitute to justify his reasons to do collateral damage to others. Yukine becomes a character that is developed by deconstruction. Rather than having him remain like a brat, he undergoes through phases and reflects his change in a way that he seems like a whole new person. Noragami depicts his character at his best with this change that shows development in a way that is humane, credible, and stands as a visage of redemption.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show focusing a lot of in characters, the plot is also attractive with its themes. Various themes explored in the series includes suicide, bullying, revenge, and temptation. As a fantasy series, it colors these themes in a way that is both humorous but at the same time feel so real. It sticks with the premise as well throughout its duration to explore concepts involving dealing with Phantoms, beings of the supernatural world that inhibits in the world of the living. Most of these features in a format of the\u2018monster of the week\u2019 scenario. However, it is important to note that every monster or conflict explores a concept to send a message. As the plot is unraveled more and more, we also find more about Yato\u2019s past which seems to be ominous. One particular character holds a deep grudge for Yato in a cat-and-mouse like game throughout the series. It sparks curiosity to viewers as Yato\u2019s past life as compared to his present. But with new friends, it also sets up a contrast between the two stages; it makes Yato view his weapons as a different light, perhaps as friends rather than just tools of war. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps fitting with the stories\u2019 concepts are the spirits involved. After all, this show does present it in fantasy form with the way spirits behave around humans. The rather obvious trope of the spirits revolves around their behavior as nearly all of them behave in an aggressive manner. As malevolent as they can be, these spirits are to be tamed with Yato as the delivery God. Even though it has a serious premise, the comedy coming from Noragami can be described as healthy. Rather than lifeless fan service, we get Yato whom presents himself as a character of charisma that invites laughter. Some of his lack of social behavior is marked with comedy thanks to his failures in the field. To support even more of the high dosage of humor are characters such as Kofuku, an energetic girl and acquaintance of her beloved \u201cYatty\u201d. On the other hand, there\u2019s Nora, a girl of many mysteries that brings in a moody sphere of gloom and doom. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of Noragami is simple yet consistent handled by Bones. Taking place in modern world means that nothing should be out of the ordinary. Yet, we get those spirits decorated by malevolence as harbingers of destruction. Background designs also makes its point with the suburban city combined with traditional Japanese themes such as shrines and altars. The character designs sparks curiosity such as Hiyori\u2019s tail. Yato\u2019s artwork design also looks interesting with his electric blue eyes, tough attitude, and jersey that comes with a scarf. The weapon (Shinki) that he uses is attractive with its stellar design. That\u2019s not the only weapon the show focuses on though. Later in the series, we witness other powerful weapons in the form of whips, guns, and even earrings all decorated with a sense of fantasy vibe. On a more negative note, Yukine\u2019s design matches those of a rebellious teenager with his blonde hair and smirk that seems to reflect loneliness. \\n\\n\r\nA strength that brings the action packed scenes of Noragami would be the soundtrack. The OST elaborates on the solid movements of the characters. No movement is wasted and all of them matches consistently with its well-coordinated orchestra. The OP song by Hello Sleepwalkers is highly decorative with characters from the cast colored by an unique form of artistry. The voice mannerisms mostly matches such as Yato\u2019s sarcasm, Hiyori\u2019s maturity, Yukine\u2019s childishness, and Kofuku\u2019s cheerfulness. Nonetheless, do appreciate the OST. I bring this to attention again as headphones are a must to enjoy this at fullest.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami will offer everybody a chance for enjoyment. It will deliver action, drama, comedy, and fantasy at your footsteps. Being a more character driven show, its small yet small cast of characters delivers credibility related to human behaviors that are explored in a relatable way. The soundtrack will blow your mind along with its high dosage of comical power. It\u2019s not just the way dialogues are spoken but how it connects to the character and story. Speaking of the story, Noragami does take a bit of patience to get used to but in the end is worth it to reap its rewards. On a more negative note, a story arc involving Yato and a particular character who has hunted him down for her entire life doesn't resolve. The length of the series prevents the anime from creating a resolution for its pace. Still, this show to me is a dark horse and something of a gem, a sparkling jewelry you won\u2019t find at any shrine but here. \\n",

            "content": "Okay, I believe that many of you have heard of the term that is widely used in anime reviews, book reviews, moview reviews, etc. Yes, it's the \"Don't judge a book by its cover\". Apparently, that idiom applies to Noragami as well. Why? It\u2019s quite simple, while the anime has a nice cover, a nice premise, and also nice previews (which came out several of times before the anime aired) the anime itself isn't nice at all. Then, is it bad? No no no, not at all. It isn\u2019t nice because it's actually above nice . It-it was amazing, way beyond expectations. Of course i'mnot going to say that without preparing a reason before hand. *cough* Lets begin then.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 9/10\\n\\n\r\n(If you haven't, please read the synopsis above first then continue reading). Okay then, simply put, the story is about a god named Yato; his weapon,Yukine; and a schoolgirl which is a half phantom, Hiyori. There isn't anything complex about the story, though it could be described as a unique. The plot is great, well executed and also well paced, though it feels like it's rushed a bit at some point. But it seems that doesn't really affect the enjoyment since it's pretty much unnoticeable anyway. The individual elements of the story is also a surplus, for example the action. Action in this anime is a no joke at all. Battles are very fluid and isn't pointless no matter how you look at it. Please don't group this anime with those typical shounen action anime with battles in every episode throughout the anime from the beginning till the very end. I don't say this often, but the thoughts on my head while I was watching it was like, \"really cool\", \"awesome\", \"amazing\", \"we want more, we want more\". All the battles in this anime has a meaning and also a lot of emotions . Though, there aren't that many battles since it's not the sole main aspect of the story. Another element of the story that you'll be getting a lot if you're going to watch it is the relationship progress between the characters which spans until the last episode. And, although the anime doesn't have a comedy genre written in the information page, there are actually comedies in this anime and they're are really funny. There's also little a romance in it, but maybe too little. \\n\r\nOh, maybe it's too a little too late to say this but the anime is dark themed. The main time of the anime seems to be evening till night. Also, sometimes the phantom are really scary with many creepy eyes in its dark body, creepy voice of multiple people saying a sentence together telling a certain someone to desperately commit suicide. That\u2019s not a bad thing though. \\n\r\nAfter going through a lot of battles and conflicts with a lot of emotions, the ending was really satisfying. Maybe not that satisfying since it causes the anime to end and made a lot of people demanding more and more. :P But still, an ending is an ending, and i'm going to say this again ~it was really satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother great aspect that made this anime better and better is the characters. The characters in Noragami are all well rounded. The different types of personality of the three main characters was great. I'm sorry if I used too much good adjectives in this review since it's undeniable-ly(bad English of mine) great in many ways. Yato is strong, badass and looks pretty stupid, but he gets serious when something happens to  Yukine or Hiyori. On the other hand, Yukine is a rebellious boy, something like a delinquent who isn't really grateful of Yato's decision of picking him as his sacred weapon. He gets ...*spoiler*. Then there\u2019s Hiyori. A human who turns into a Half-Phantom because she tried to save Yato from getting hit by a bus, but made herself getting hit by it instead.  Hiyori is a nice and cheerful girl who likes to tag along with Yato and Yukine\u2019s godly activities. She can\u2019t stand the idea of the the two getting hurt. Supporting casts are pretty good too, but i\u2019m not going to go too deep into it. (Watch it by yourself okay?)\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that popped in my head when watching the first episode was \u2018Beautiful\u2019.  The studio responsible for this beautiful artwork and animation is Bones. If you haven\u2019t heard about it, it\u2019s the studio well-known for many great and popular shounen anime, like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Darker than Black, Soul Eater, Eureka Seven and a much more. And... if you\u2019re not familiar with any of those, I\u2019ll tell you how it\u2019s very pleasant for the eye.  Fluid eye-catching battles, nice character design and, beautiful breathtaking backgrounds is what you\u2019re going to get from Noragami. So, that\u2019s how it got a 9/10(great) score from me.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nReally nice OP and ED. The OP is called Hello Sleepwalkers, which is a a rock themed song.  The artist is a band named Hello Sleepwalkers and the name of the song is Goya no Machiawase. I don\u2019t know about the band before and I just found out about it from watching Noragami, but hell it was really good. And, the ED is called Heart Realize by the famous group of musician in the anime industry, Supercell. The quality of the song is superb.\\n\r\nVoice acting are great too. Seiyuu\u2019s voice really feels like it matched the characters\u2019s personality. The background sounds also fits the atmosphere. I really like the battle\u2019s background music which is really unique. Of course, sounds are undescribable by words so, please watch it by yourself to hear it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOh, those good times of waiting every week for a new episode. I enjoyed this anime fully with all of my heart. It get\u2019s me anxious every time and I really want to know what\u2019s going to happen next. There are some episodes that has a great comedy and made me laugh out loud, some that has great battles, some that has a lot of emotions and affects my emotions as well, and the last episode that made me say \u201cplease don\u2019t end!\u201d.  Of course, I\u2019ll be hoping for a second season since there are plenty of story material waiting to be animated, but I guess hoping to much could lead to bad day if it doesn't go your way.  But overall I really enjoyed this series. 10 points from me :D.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words\\n\\n\r\nNoragami or \u30ce\u30e9\u30ac\u30df is a great action-shounen anime that has a great story and not-pointless battles and also a little comedy. If you liked those genres, then without doubt, you\u2019ll like Noragami even more. I highly recommended it to everyone looking for a great series to spend their time at.\\n",

            "content": "Its really honestly a shame that this anime isn't more popular than it is. I find more and more its harder to get into action animes when you've watched so many that let your hopes down in the last two episodes. Nowadays, anime seem to either wow me to tears or bore me with uninteresting characters set in a plot that's way too cool for the likes of cardboard characters. Or your get anime that is just plain worthy of throwing to the depth of the internet where you could care less whether someone actually gives any shit about. Forgettable. Noragami for me wasn't anyof those. Not even worthy of putting into the wow me to tears section. What this anime did for me was made me think - and that's why this anime, in my opinion, is definitely one of the best Ive ever seen this season.\\n\\n\r\nTo be totally frank, I'm not usually one for the typical shounen, and tend to like the dark more gritty animes. I usually watch these sort of shounen ones when I just can't find anything worthy of my tastes. But oh boy, was I glad to have picked up Noragami. This anime really sets in the terrifying mind set of being forgotten by all the people around you, and what one must to do be remembered and to feel wanted by those people. I found each time Yato struggled to maintain himself, through being remembered and worshiped, my heart would go out to him and I felt the pain of being lost and old and forgotten.\\n\\n\r\n-I'm not going to rewrite a synopsis, so if you really want to know all the nitty gritty details, read it at the top-\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around God names Yato, his regalia and a half phantom, Hyori. I learned to love each and every character in this series - each having good character and executing realistic choices int he plot of this anime. The blend of Japanese folklore was very visually interesting, and I always seem to enjoy those types of anime with underlying subtexts and messages.\\n\\n\r\nI tend to dislike when Main characters are treated badly by the rest of the cast, just because they seem to give off a weak or annoying sort of aura ( even if us viewers know how bad ass they really can be) So i was very cautious with Noragami. It seemed like everyone thought Yato, the protagonist, was your typical bum and purposefully exclude him for only that reason, even if he was a god. But that soon turned around, in about the second episode. Sure, they still liked to tease the protagonist about his habits and how poor and helpless he was - but there was still a sort of underlying respect that each character had for him, and they grew to cherish Yato. Hyori for example, explains her dislike and annoyance in yato, yet still respects him and wants to be with him. Hyori is a typical female lead, who can actually hold her own and has a decent personality. I have a thing with helpless female leads that pisses me off to no end, so seeing a female character, strong and willing like Hyori, is a breath of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is stellar. I tend to be quite nitpicky with art and Noragami was outstanding. The character designs were realistic, clothing appropriate and animations amazing. The colours used for the fight scenes and phantom deaths made you want to stare at the sequence for hours, analyzing the design of the star that seemed to explode out whenever Yato killed a phantom. The phantoms themselves were drawn organically lovely - but still gave a sort of creep atmosphere. The blights and eyes were done marvelous, showing the disgusting of infection. The blue hue all over yato gave him a godly aura, yet he still looked human from the blend of his modern clothing. I could go on but I wont. Just that the art of this anime seemed to never cut loops and always keep me interested.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is absolutely amazing, bringing in traditional Japanese music with a sort of modern rap and hip hop themes. The opening fits extremely well, though it changes three times throughout the series. I didn't mind it at all, and actually enjoyed seeing the variety. The ending was cute, not that memorable but I did actually watch the ending, which I never do so that's saying something. The music during the fight scenes was intense, and got you into the mood of traditional style, not unlike the Yato god himself. The music for the phantoms was down right creepy, and suited the atmosphere to a T. And finally the music played for yato's silliness... was down right hilarious. The funky off tones of the beat made me giggle every time even if the situation wasn't that funny.\\n\\n\r\nYato in particular is a very interesting character to follow. Development wise, he didn't really change much outwardly form what originally saw. I would almost call it a sort of backwards character development, because we got to see how he developed into the Yato god he is now. Throughout the anime I found myself gaining respect for the god, seeing his struggle and triumphs. He mirrored it through Yukine, his regalia. Yukine had the most character development in this anime. We see him rise, to fall, to slowly rise back again. His personality was bitchy, yes, but with good reason. Characters who lash out for no reason, and all the cast seem to be okay with it is just plain bad writing, but Noragami gives Yukine a damn good reason for it and has the characters react to it positively, because of particular a reason as well. Forget about a hollow anime, this one actually bothered to give good, concrete reasons for a melt down, which I find animes recently have been lacking severely. The interaction between Yato's extravagant character and Yukine's major attitude was very interesting to see. Both grew closer together throughout the anime making me yearn for more scenes of Yato and Yukine interacting.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gives a perfects blend of action, comedy, supernatural and mystery that will have you itching for more every episode. The anime is well spaced, even though it diverges slightly at the end from the manga (if you bothered to read it) - but still keeps it fresh and fulfilling. I would recommend this anime to anybody, and hope you enjoy it as much as I did - this anime will always have a special place in my heart.\\n\\n",

Great show for younger teenagers\r\n-If you are looking for something intellectually stimulating, I would not bother.  \r\nThe show takes stuff that has been done before and presents it in a way that flows well and feels pretty natural.  \r\nThe Good:\r\n-characters are likable and despite them being gods and regalias, they are pretty believable.\r\n-humor is very well executed.\r\n-no filler\r\nThe Bad:\r\n-Thisshow screams chuunibyou syndrome.  Almost everytime Yato, the MC gets into a fight, he has this very cheesy spiel involving a special backdrop.

            "content": "Five yen is all it takes to get your wish granted. (If only that were true).\r\nNoragami is a series that I really enjoyed and felt good watching. The saddest part being the fact that it only had 11 episodes and honestly deserves a lot more. I am left hoping for a sequel that I am certain will not disappoint.\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nSound: 9/10\r\nCharacter: 8/10\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\r\nOverall: 8/10\r\nGood points:\r\n+Very good male and female protagonists\r\n+Diverse range of character personalities\r\n+Comic humour\r\n+Touching, romantic scenes\r\n+Good actions sequences where it counts\r\n+Great OP and ED themes\r\nBad points:\r\n-Lack of overarching conflict\r\n-Underwhelming antagonists\r\nYou will love this anime if you love:\r\n1. Cute scenes that makes you feellike this --> :3\\n\r\n2. Shounen action sequences\\n\r\n3. Cut-the-long-story short romance (like seriously, enough of those long monologues, romance should be short and sweet)\\n\r\n4. Swordfighting/Slashing YEAH!\\n\r\n5. Comic humour\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is split into three main arcs. The first being an introductory arc which tells you all about the 3 main characters, Yato, Yukine and Hiyori and how they came to meet, the second arc being the main conflict with Yukine's corruption and the third arc (lasting only 3 episodes) being the final battle against Rabo, the killer god of calamity.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc is full of comedy and funny parts thanks to Yato's very lively and exaggerated personality, Hiyori's kick-ass moves and Yukine's cute reactions. The three share a chemistry that would make anyone comfortable watching through all of it, even if there isn't much of a plot line. All we have is the trio doing odd jobs and trying to earn money to build a shrine (+1)\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is where the first main conflict kicks in, where Yato and Yukine's life is threatened through  \"corruption\" of Yukine's soul. Yukine becomes stubborn and violent and ends up blighting Yato so much that Yato nearly dies. Yato however, refuses to give up Yukine or punish him, and instead sacrifices himself in order to show Yukine his sins. The plot line is quite gripping, so I'm giving full points for it (+3).\\n\\n\r\nThe third arc is where Yato faces off with his long-time old partner Rabo, who is still clinging on to the wicked wishes of people. Yato, however, has changed and shows Rabo who's boss in a very action-packed sequence. The main inconsistency though is how Yato kept on saying that Yukine \"might die\" against Rabo's power, but clearly, even when Rabo absorbed all the Phantoms for power, Yukine was nowhere near dying, and Yato was essentially still going strong. I thought that Rabo was generally underwhelming near the end and had little or no plan at all against Yato. Doesn't he know how strong Yato can actually be? He ended up saying \"I actually wanted to die, btw\", and I was like... uhh ok. Meh. (+2)\\n\\n\r\nSo altogether, there were only 2 main plot lines, but they were quite okay independently. There was no overarching conflict, although the anime does hint to a second season because of the mysterious Nora that we still don't know much about.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought that art was clean and smooth. I didn't like the way the phantoms were being drawn though. The shapes and sizes of the phantoms were also really random, and incidentally just resembled about anything the artist thought about (frogs, stingrays, snakes, crabs) basically based off random animals in general. But everything else was nice, especially the animation of Sekki which I was totally hooked to, as well as the abilities of all the other Regalias as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound for the anime was definitely top-notch. I loved both the OP and ED themes, and the back ground music for both the touching scenes and action scenes were really good. It never bore me at all, so it was a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's only a 11 episode anime so I can't ask for much, but I thought that character development fleshed out definitely could be improved. Only Yato's past and backstory was even touched upon, but that was interesting enough to keep me watching. I wished they had put more backstory to Yukine though, maybe what Yukine was like when he was still alive? There was, however, a lot of character growth in Yukine, so I think that makes up for all the lack of backstory that he had. (+3)\\n\\n\r\nThough Yato is my favourite characters (just because he can hack N slash), I want to specially mention Hiyori as well. She's generous, kind, full of love and compassion and understanding. She makes sacrifices, shows appreciation, gives hope and is just this stable rock that completely compliments Yato. I think Hiyori is an excellent female lead in this anime and she NEVER felt annoying like so many other female characters that I come across. She can also kick ass, so that's why she's awesome. (+2)\\n\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters were also very interesting. We have the Bishamon team, the Kufuku duo and the \"Tenjin and his concubines\", all of whom really help with the whole comic element to the anime. The character personalities are very diverse and interesting, and definitely a pull factor for this anime. (+2)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the antagonists, Rabo was interesting at first, but honestly he became very shallow toward the end. Only Nora was a point of interest in the entire anime, but she also didn't do much but tempt Yato to use her. Although the anime never really explained why Yato didn't want to use her, as if using a Nora would corrupt his soul or something, but this is something that I am assuming.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I thought that the character interactions and relationships were very well crafted. This was one of the few animes where I actually LOVED the main characters for who they are and felt a sense of emotional attachment to them just because of that bubbly feeling inside. Aww. Especially all the cute face rubbing and general cuteness of all the characters. :3 (+1)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe comic element to this anime is really good. And I love it because it doesn't even pride itself as a \"comedy\" genre, but it made me laugh a lot more than other comedy animes that I've watched, just because of the really good characters and solid slapstick. One particularly funny part was when Yato was flying downwards and talking to a guy who was falling off a the top of a roof for like 5 minutes and Yukine was like, \"Hmm this seems like a really long fall, dont'cha think?\" (+3)\\n\\n\r\nOther funny parts include almost every interaction with the Kufuku duo and every time Yukine gets into a rather awkward position with Hiyori. (oh yes and Hiyori falcon kicking everyone in her way). The anime also got me very excited across each episode, and I honestly didn't want to stop until I reached the end. It wasn't that it was very suspenseful, but that it was very engaging and I knew that it would not disappoint my taste time and time again. (+3)\\n\\n\r\nThere was not a single time when I felt bored watching this anime, and I think that's a plus point. The pacing was just right. Not too fast and not too slow, they really emphasized on the parts that made you feel for the characters. (+2)\\n\\n\r\nI particularly loved the Sekki activation scenes, it just gets me every time. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA very good job well done to the creators of this anime. I think it was ALOT of potential to be honest. Now that all the main characters are fleshed out, all they need to do is develop them even further, expand to the rest of the supporting cast, dump all of them into a convincing plot narrative/conflict and you will get an amazing sequel.",

            "content": "The perfect balance of spiritual conflict and slice of life comedy.\r\nStory - 8/10 Noragami is another installation of a trend of recent series that are trying to incorporate youkai battle plots with a light hearted slice of life/comedy/romance element, and surprisingly Noragami is able to pull it off. Without giving away any spoilers, the story is quite unique because it is able to find a great balance between series scenes and funny moments. The drama and action are enough to keep you enticed, and the RomCom isn't so overbearing that the side stories take away from the main plot. The only part of the storyI didn't care for was Yukine's arc. I thought it was a bit too dramatic and lasted too long, but if you can get over his annoying immaturity for a few episodes the rest of the series is great.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8/10 the artwork of Noragami is pretty good, with a unique op and closing to boot. The fighting scenes aren't over done, the scenery has great detail, and all the characters have unique characteristics compared to the typical anime types.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -10/10 The best part of Noragami is the characters, literally the only one that wasn't a 10/10 was Yukine. However, I realize he had to have more drastic development than other characters so I'm still giving this section a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - 8/10 overall I thought Noragami was a great series, and has a lot to offer everyone. It is funny, exciting, and heartfelt at times without having too many filler episodes. My only complaints are the distribution of episodes to certain arcs, and the fact that the series itself is only 12 episodes. I feel that if it had been given 25 or so, there would have been more time for better plot development and the ending wouldn't have felt so rushed. But alas 12 is all we get, and I would recommend this series to anyone, and especially those who like sword play and spiritual world genres.",

            "content": "Noragami, or as I like to call it \u201cEveryone Loves Yato\u201d, has a lot going for it. It looks nice, it's got appealing characters, and has a unique soundtrack. But the way the story presents itself in its short 12 episode run time has some dire consequences.\r\nStory (6/10):  \r\nNoragami is all over the place. First we are introduced to the supposed main conflict of fixing Hiyori\u2019s condition, but that gets put off as we get some filler of Yato desperately trying to make some money. These episodes were amusing and can pull off some good action and laughs, but being time wasters, there prettymuch insignificant. The majority of the show focuses on the relationship between Yato and Yukine which was actually well done and the only part of Noragami that had a decent payoff. It contains enough teen angst to be relatable, but not too much to be irritating. But this leaves us with just three episodes left to explore Yato\u2019s past. It not really compelling as its not really explored in depth and in the end, it turns out to be another damsel in distress story. It just ends up feeling insignificant like the filler before it, not the best way to end the series.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I could compare its pacing style to be Bebop. After all, both have a main conflict which is delayed in favor of some filler episodes. Cowboy Bebop succeeded as the fillers were good (for the most part) and its main conflict was resolved within its 26 episode run. Noragami, on the other hand, doesn't just leave its main conflict hanging, but various sub-plots are unsolved and the filler we got ranged from decent to plain extraneous. This was inevitable because of the 12 episode run. With 12 episodes, you simply don\u2019t have the time to mess around too much when you have so many open subplots left hanging. \\n\\n\r\nSome may say that this is excused because season 2 was announced. To that I say, not really. You cannot rely on the hopes for a 2nd season to resolve conflicts. When i'm watching a season, I at least expect some kind of a satisfying resolution (i'm looking at you Tokyo Ghoul), because to be honest, most anime don\u2019t even get a second season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nYato, our main protagonist, is a well rounded character. He\u2019s funny (with some of the funniest faces you\u2019ll ever see) and can even be bad-ass when he wants to be. But thanks to the shaky plot, what we know about Yato is incredibly vague. Oh yeah, remember how I called this show \u201cEveryone Loves Yato\u201d. Well lemme explain, Yato seems to have a relationship with everyone in the show. Its constantly implied he has history with them, but the show never really touches upon these histories. The side characters aren't really fleshed out and it leads to them just being there cause the plot said so with the worst offender being Bishamon. She\u2019s out to kill Yato for a simple reason, but the show never actually shows the story behind it other than they hate each other. \\n\\n\r\nYukine is the most developed character in the show. That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s the most likable, but seeing Yukine struggling with the problems of being dead coupled with the frustration of teen angst is believable and at times heartfelt. Seeing him grow and develop is truly satisfying. As for Hiyori, she\u2019s a mixed bag. She starts off rather decent and strong with her inspiration of wrestling moves. But as the series progresses, she suffers something I\u2019d like to call the Asuna effect in which she devolves to become less of a character and less capable of defending herself to the point of becoming a damsel in distress. As likable as she was, she\u2019s really nothing more than the typical schoolgirl archetype with some minor quirks.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (7/10): \\n\\n\r\nStudio Bones once again does a great job with the animation. The character designs were appealing and the phantom had a very creative look to them even if they were just colorful, floating sea creatures. When the phantom\u2019s die, they let some sort of a, how do I say it, wordy explosion and it looks gorgeous every time. Unfortunately, the phantom fights got to be underwhelming at times as it was just Yato doing the same chant over and over again with the same animation and line (sometimes twice per episode) followed by a single slash. The stand out action scenes were the ones involving two gods which was definitely the highlight of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening for Noragami just screams cool. While I don\u2019t think the show reaches the Rule of Cool, this opening got me hyped for every episode even when the story got underwhelming. The black and white characters blended well with the blue colored environment. The song on its own is catchy and is fitting with the show. The ending, on the other hand, is meh. Its not bad and it slightly grew on me after a few listens, but it just felt a bit generic and didn't blend well with the upbeat nature of the show or the opening.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Noragami is a hit or miss. At first glance it may sound a little odd with one of the battle themes sounding like a guy saying \u201crectangle\u201d over and over again. But for me, it fits with the show quite well. The soundtrack has quite a bit of hip hop along with some tunes that fit really well with the shinto themes. You\u2019ll definitely get used to it and eventually the soundtrack will hype you up during the battle scenes. The voice acting is fine as everyone fit their role. Standouts include Yato\u2019s voice actor for balancing between goofy and serious and Yukine\u2019s voice actor for capturing the teen angst and struggles you would expect of an adolescent boy. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nDespite its many flaws, Noragami is still a fun show to watch. It\u2019s a likable show and it\u2019s easy to see why this was the stand out show of the bland Winter 2014 season. Its got some major holes in the story which may be fixed in the upcoming season, but I wouldn't count on it. I give Noragami a 6/10.\\n",

            "content": "*spoilers*\r\nNoragami is an action adventure with a rich history and characters such as God's, Phantoms, Regalias, and how could you forget the most important a beautiful High School Girl. Our lead character is the 'God of War' named Yato, voice acted by the ever so lovely Hiroshi Kamiya; yes this is only subbed as of now, who wishes to become a very rich and popular God but has to earn his way up 5 yen at a time! which in dollars is ~5 cents. In the very first episode his weapon, Regalia, decides to leave him because of how poor he happens to be, butalso because his hands get really sweaty! \\n\\n\r\nYato takes several jobs as a God in the first episode and amidst the arduous task of finding a lost kitten a girl named Iki Hiyori notices he's about to get hit by a bus and decides to jump to the rescue. Soon after, at the hospital, Yato explains to her how God's cannot be seen and that she herself is special because she can see him. Amidst the confusion of Hiyori's and the job seeking of Yato's they suddenly get under attack, and here our second male lead, Yukine, is spotted and Yato turns him into his new Regalia in the shape of a sword. He is a very annoying character for reasons I will let you find out on your own. \\n\\n\r\nThere are several other God's including Kofuku, Tenjin, Rabo, etc all with there respective Regalia(s). Most of these characters fill in several typical tropes your average anime has and in fact most of the show revolves around battles with these Gods. Yato has a rich history with the Gods and it's one of the bigger themes of the story. This story has no main plot, nothing driving it to keep me hooked to it, and because of that I found it hard continuing it all the way through. I felt as if the story was just going on for the sake of having the story.. go on. The fights were gorgeous and the art was just as gorgeous and it had the music to back it up but the fights were always lacking to me as if they really had no meaning to them; the God would fight Yato because they held some sort of 'past grudge' on him which really seemed like a lame excuse to add these fights in.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't really mentioned much about the female lead Hiyori simply because her character seemed very unneeded. She never developed by any means and was simply there to act as a cheerleader for the male leads, helping them through there troubles, although that might be giving her a little too much credit. There might still be hope for her character because a season two is coming out soon which I look forward to reviewing as well!\\n\\n\r\nOverall mediocre at best! 5/10",

            "content": "Noragami was simply decent, although if someone were to ask me whether I liked it, my answer to that question would lean more towards a \"No, not really\" oriented answer. Quite frankly, this show disappointed me, to say the least. And its unfortunate because I really thought I was going to like this one, but sadly, the hype just didn't cut it for this one. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nDefinitely not the best, and fails to be in many ways. It lacked too many major details, and I found it somewhat choppy in some areas. At first, I liked the whole, \"stray god trying to make it big\"idea, and the first half of the series was manageable, if not, enjoyable, but as it progressed further, I felt myself beginning to lose it. It lacked detail and sophistication, a show that would only be worth posing as a time-killer, just another thing to keep you semi-busy until you can find something more interesting to do. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Visuals: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWasn't too bad, especially since I also watched this on in high quality (I always watch my animes in HD in order to give it's visuals a better judgement). The anime was also filled with many scenic parts, which proved to be beautifully colored and detailed, as well as decent looking effects. However, during most, if not, ALL the fight scenes, the animation dropped by at least 50%. This isn't particularly uncommon in most anime, but that certainly doesn't mean it isn't a problem, especially since this is a shorter series. Most short anime series I've seen lately (ones that have aired around the same time as Noragami) have all managed to keep a steady and nice animation quality, even throughout moments where most animators would get lazy and throw in some half-assed frames or cheap looking CG animation, which is what I saw in this series at many points. Examples of some short series who stayed consistent with crisp looking visuals would be Stein's Gate (well, this one's actually 23, but this only further proves my point), Psycho-Pass S2, Angel Beats, Black Butler S2, and Baccano (this one came out sometime earlier, but I can easily compare its animation qualities to Noragami).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn't too bad either, honestly. It was very unique and had a very nice touch to it. The music in this particular show was quite different form the typical rock-ish J-pop you usually hear. It was mixed with some dubstep qualities and, how should I say it... funk?  which in my opinion is a plus. My favorite track from the series, however, was Harmony. I for some reason really enjoyed it when this particular one was playing, so soothing~\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nHm, I think it's safe enough to say they weren't the best. I mean, as whole, they were funny with the way they interacted, and the the relationship Hiyori and Yato gradually developed wasn't too bad either, especially because it wasn't forced, it made sense, and it was, for the most part, practical. But other than that, I found the cast very mediocre. Many of the problems that arose in this anime were basically the fault of the characters not being able to communicate their feelings in a sensible manner. They were in fact selfish, only thinking about their own needs and what they thought they wanted, without giving a thought of \"Gee, I wonder how 'so and so' feels about me doing this/acting in this way? Maybe I should ask them...\" But in most cases we got, \"I do what I want because I'm 'so and so' or because I deserve 'this and this'. Screw you.\" (this is 110% directed towards the poor relationship Yato and Yukine had among themselves, just so you know. But keep in mind, Yato brought into the show the things that made it watchable, to say the least, and was definitely one the few reasons why I decided to complete the series) If they had just taken the time to tone down their bitching about 'xyz' and just, I don't know, TALK about how to improve their partnership, many of the problems that occurred in the anime would've been solved or prevented, easily. And then there's Hiyori. She was an okay character at first, her being a half-dead phantom and having to pursue (I guess you can say) Yato in order to be changed back to a full human. That was a story line I didn't have many qualms about, but for some odd reason unknown to me, as the series progressed, she was pretty much demoted as a main character to a petty damsel in distress for some villain we only got to know anything about during just the last 2 episodes of the series... hm... how unsatisfying. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then that brings me to the villain, whom I found extremely random and unappealing to the story. Honestly, my reaction to the last-minute introduction of this character was \"Oh look... a random villain with little to no back story appeared... yay.\" It felt so misplaced because the time in which we began hearing even a hint about this Rabou character was, I believe, episode 10 or 11, and this is like what, a 12 episode series. I mean, you've just gotta be kidding me on that one. Not only that, the information we finally learn of him is nothing too special, nothing that would or should make you think his debut was anything to be particularly excited for. Additionally, he was an idiot. Like, I don't know whether it was just a petty pride thing, but for some reason, he was so hell-bent on fighting against his partner after what, hundreds of years, after Yato had clearly moved on and even told him to move on as well. But nah, this Rabou dude decided consuming himself with Ayakashi was a swell idea, which there was no real point in doing. Which then brings us to the ending fight scene, which was also unsatisfying. Yeah, we saw some waterbending and water Jutsu stuff going on, but that was it. We experienced nothing different from Yato, EVEN when he switched to rage mode after Rabou had broken the orb containing Hiyori's memories. I honestly expected Yato to have some hidden ability, something much cooler and unexpected than Rabou's, but all we got was a generic 'last one standing\" ending where the villain was easily defeated, and therefore had no business being a villain in the first place. Villains like that are for kids shows, not more elaborate ones, but then again, this was not an elaborate anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I must also mention Bishamon. Not too sure what her purpose to the story was other than the fact that one of her shinki was killed by Yato, and now wants to kill Yato for doing so. We know nothing about her, her past, and who her deceased shinki even was. She also wasn't given  sufficient enough screen time, which only made me more irritated about trying to figure out who exactly this woman was. But of course, this may have been intended, as a second season may be on the way (whether another one is actually needed is debatable).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the comedy and the visuals of the anime. The comedic aspect of it was childish (sometimes mature), but I laughed, and I tend to have a soft spot for shows that manage to make me laugh, seriously. That's a always a plus. However, that is only the surface, most of the things that went underneath the series in terms of story and characters wasn't very appealing, and these are all important factors that are meant to add to the watching experience, not take away from it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was simply... decent, a show that clearly fell below the hype level. Many aspects of the show seemed bland and unfinished, always building up to some interesting ideas, only for it to be discontinued later on, a reoccurring trait I observed in this series. The characters weren't very interesting and sometimes irritable, and the ending was unsatisfying. But even so, they had great visuals and music, and the series was nonetheless an enjoyable one, even if how enjoyable it was was all the series had to begin with. So fellow denizens reading this review, all I can say to you about this series is, if you have free time with absolutely nothing to do, I guess you can give this one try, just be sure not to expect much, especially if your the type who prefers well thought out, detailed storylines with great characters and supporting details... which Noragami didn't exactly have. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*I apologize for any grammatical errors* \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So, I think it's important to write a review on this, since I may have a perspective that a lot of people don't really have on this one.\r\nNoragami is about Yato, a minor god of calamity who can't get a shrine of his own, and is kind of a bum, who lives with other gods. He also can't seem to keep a servant spirit, because they all run off because he's too poor, and they want a higher lifestyle. Enter Hiyori, a girl who has an accident that causes her to slip in and out of astral travel. This is very dangerous for her, andso she ends up befriending Yato who promises to find a way to save her. Along the way Yato battles lots of demon monsters who are corrupted spirits. \\n\\n\r\nTo many people, Noragami is just another shonen. Battles and action sequences, and some light comedy. And to many people that's all it will be. \\n\\n\r\nBut at it's core, Noragami is a spiritual piece. It contains elements of Buddhist (and Shinto)  teachings that make up the core of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe main premise of this anime is all about the Buddhist concept of Karma, and Sange. Sange is the act of making spiritual contrition: being freed from the burdens of one's mistakes, and harmful acts, by truly being sorry and remorseful.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami, is at it's core, a story about people who do willful, harmful behavior, and then when the karmic burden becomes too great, realize the error of their ways, and truly and sincerely redeem themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an extremely powerful, and deep story in that sense. For many people, they won't get that, they will see gods, and demons, and spirits, and ghosts, and a girl who does astral travel, and think it's all about battles, and another shonen. People have even oddly compared it to Hataraku Maou-sama! (the Devil is a part-timer!) simply because Yato has a part time job. But it's while there are some similarities in the comedy aspects, in Noragami, Yato's \"job\" aspect truly is a very minor, almost glossed over aspect of the story, and the anime itself is about much deeper concepts. \\n\\n\r\nNoragami has a lot of different elements in it. If all you want is action and battles, hey, it has that, and enough to keep you entertained. If you want romance, it has bits of that too. And if you want character development it's loaded with that. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you want something deeper, there is an extremely deep spiritual element too. And that, to me is really the heart of Noragami. All else is just window dressings to provide entertainment. But it's the spiritual development of the characters, and the overall deep spiritual meanings that make this one special.",

            "content": "Up until today, i've never heard of Noragami. It is relatively new but if my friend haden't asked me to watch this with him i probably wouldn't have seen it for a while. That being said i'm glad i took a couple hours of my time to watch the whole first season in one night. I didn't think much of it at first, it looked cool but I personally didn't think it was going to be anything special. This show surprised me ALOT, this a great anime with very little flaws. \r\nStory (9). The story is great, I love how it took time to developthe characters and relationships without sacrificing action or excitement. The drama between the characters worked good as well very rarely being boring. In the first few episodes I thought the show was going to go one way, and it evolved a great deal molding into a fantastic plot without holes. The story picks up quickly as well, getting right to the point in the first episode and then continuing from there. There are no major plot twists, but there are alot of unexpected actions that happen causing my interest to grow. The story takes time to develop the character relationships and still have a central plot point, then in the last few episodes it introduces the main antagonist. At first glance this wouldn't really work well, but when you see the drama between characters you understand why it was structured like this and you see how it actually works. Each episode isn't just about the drama though, episodes typically have excitement and an obstacle for the characters to overcome while progressing the story simultaneously.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (10). Oh lord, this animation was spot on perfect, bones did a fantastic job making the show look gorgeous. All the characters have vibrant colors and unique and pretty designs. The environments look good and clean as well. The CGI effects aren't overused at all and look perfect where ever they're placed. Water and rain effects look fantastic and blend really well with the overall animation. This is a very colorful series, having unique and bright but real looking characters and creatures. The Phantom creatures look bright and beautiful, very unique as well. The action scene choreography is done perfectly and looks very smooth and fluent. Overall the animation is spot on perfect, everything is pretty and interesting to look at while not being over done.\\n\\n\r\nSounds (9). This really goes without saying, the sounds are all crisp clean and very interesting in the case of characters using special powers or other supernatural creatures as well. The soundtrack works very well too, the music binds perfectly with fight scenes and doesn't eclipse the action. The intro and outro songs are very good as well, nothing amazing but they set the tone well and I didn't mind listening to it every episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8). The main characters, Yato, Hiyori, and yukine all worked very well and served as great protagonists. Yato is a very likable guy and is humorous as well. He is also a badass and shows that he truly cares for his friends. Hiyori is very good as well, her voice acting performance was great and she brought alot of emotion and depth to the show. Yukine came off initially as annoying, then he grew on me and by the end I liked him alot. This show does a great job at making you care about all three main characters and being concerned about what happens to them. Another thing the show does well involves the antagonists. Being introduced late in the series normally it would feel like they're shoehorned in. In the few episodes they were there they actually made great villains with a decent back story. They really gave Yato a struggle and the show does a good job at making you hate them. The supporting characters were very good as well, they didn't eclipse the main cast but at the same time they all had great unique personalities and brought a great presence to the show. They all got equal screen time for the most part and they had some funny, intense and subtle moments. It doesn't overcrowd you with a shit ton of supporting cast it nails just the right amount. The show also does a great job at developing the relationship between the main characters, they all have really good chemistry and you really get the sense that they're friends. The relationships evolve and change as well and it's very interesting to see unfold.\\n\\n\r\nI just really liked this anime, it surprised me alot and i was glad with the results. The story had good closure as well and had a good subtle ending. It also gave me excitement for the next season. This show is light hearted and funny but at the same time carries a decent amount of emotion and action at the same time. I wouldn't say it mixes the action and comedy but it does a great job at distinguishing it and at the same time binding it together. The episode endings didn't leave me demanding more but i was very interested with the story.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this show i enjoyed it alot and it was very solid all the way through, if you liked my long review (I'm sorry) please give it a thumbs up (:\\n",

            "content": "Bones and a supernatural shounen? This just might be amazing...\r\nUnlike previous works of Bones that may prompt one to think of the magical works of Fullmetal Alchemist or Zetsuen no Tempest, the concept of Noragami is rather peculiar; it takes the concept of deities and the supernatural, and places it in a shounen atmosphere. Such concepts have nevertheless been done many times before, however, Noragami takes a strange twist on it. Yato is a rather poor god (being a newcomer), and in order obtain respect and fame he must earn it through favors. On his path to fame, he encounters Hiyori Iki, a seemingly randomschoolgirl. Hiyori notices Yato in danger (he isn't usually noticed) and \"pushes him out of the way of a speeding bus; unaware of his status as deity.\" This ultimately causes Hiyori to become a \"half-phantom\" and  thus becomes a major driving factor for the plot in the series. Unfortunately, Noragami (in this aspect) lacks strong plot and premise. There are many inconsistencies that seem to arrive, and many questions unanswered. For example, why was it possible that Hiyori could see Yato in episode 1? The anime itself makes a rather ridiculous example of how deities and phantoms from the \"far shore\" are unnoticable, and later it becomes a huge plot device. Such holes continue when one considers the lack of proper backstory of many side-characters, such as the later revealed incidents with Bishamon, Nora, or even Kazuma. Without a proper amount of content, one has to question their true relevence aside from being plot devices or canon fodder. Unfortunately, Noragami totals at a whopping 12 episodes, so there isn't much time to provide for such things. Luckily, Noragami doesn't take up the challenge of compressing so much into a miniscule amount of episodes, as seen many times before by previous failures. \\n\\n\r\nThe primary focus of Noragami seems to be the characterization of Yato's trio of: himself, Hiyori and Yukine. Because of this, the pacing of the story seems to be quite slow, and one could easily get lost at the shift of plot's goal. The whole thing does seem a bit messy; however, Noragami does manage to maintain great characterization. The driving factor of this anime seems to be Yukine, a wandering spirit who still has regrets from when he was still alive. This is (more-or-less) due to the fact that he died while still young. Upon reunion with the world, his \"regret\" is slowly shaped into \"jealousy,\" and as a spirit, these emotions do not come cheap. These concepts of his \"regrets,\" and the \"punishments\" regarding them really starts to ameliorate the plot; Yato is left with the trial to properly discipline Yukine, while concurrently trying to maintain his own ideals and respect. From this point on, the series itself takes quite a bit of an emotional turn, and the darker pasts and truths of the characters are revealed. Noragami does a great job with the aspect of \"regret,\" and utilizes the supernatural aspect of the anime to further the emotional progression. Unfortunately, Hiyori herself doesn't develop into a substantial character, but fills the role of both an inspiration to the others and an essential advocate. \\n\\n\r\nWhether Bones has done a good job with the animation is quite important, as Noragami is (despite the lack of emphasis of it) an action anime. Ultimately, it seems like Bones really delievered quality content. A good representation of how this is portrayed is shown in the first few minutes of Noragami. A girl named Matsumi is seemingly being attacked (quite reminiscient of schizophrenia), and Yato descends as she pleads help from the gods. Yato slays a rather menacing looking phantom by a means of many flashy jumps and slices. The animation in this scene in particular is very much like many of the other battle scenes in the anime. It's done quite well, and very much gives an impression of a typical shounen with many action scenes. Noragami also suppplies an array of impressive swordsmanship shown throughout the series, delivering what many who were interested in Noragami came to see. Unfortunately, Noragami isn't entirely action, as it seems to be a minor aspect of the series. Most of the anime scenes fail to live up to a continuing expectation of colorful looking phantoms and artsy buildings as seen in the opening. It should also be noted that the consistency isn't regarded too highly in terms of animation, but it's honestly hard to complain when Noragami was produced in 2014.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the opening, the selection of music was quite appropriate throughout the series. After an introduction of various closeups and 3D gimmicks, Yato is seen around a rather surreal city while \"Goya no Machiawase\" plays, a J-rock song that seems to maintain the mood of a typical shounen. The ED in particular, \"Heart Realize,\" a standard J-pop song, captures a much more realistic mood of Noragami; Hiyori is seen searching for Yato and Yukine with an umbrella in a rather frigid, yet exciting atomsphere. Supercell in particular did a nice job of introducing Tia, a young Nico Nico singer. Her voice needs more exposure to the anime industry, as with Noragami, I am now a fan of hers. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, in retrospect, is quite conventional. Yato is voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya, a very credible voice actor who won best  \"Best Lead Actor\" and \"Best Personality\" at the Third Seiyuu Awards. Many viewers may be familiar with his work in Attack on Titan as Levi. The other seiyuus can be held into equal respects, as Maaya Uchida, who acts as Hiyori, won Best New Actress Award in the 8th Seiyu Awards. I'm quite impressed by the voice actors' level of ability, as the amount of emotion needed is essential for success. Without the proper voice acting, it wouldn't be proper to call Noragami a \"tear-jerker,\" while it certainly does hold the title. Unfortunately, the voice acting can only do so much for the series. \\n\\n\r\nNoragami is an anime that had some mediocre plot points, but shapened it up with its great production and characterization. Its pacing is slow, but correct, as it manages to slip in its high points. It's a bit unfortunate that Noragami received only twelve episodes; it could have easily become something special in the anime industry.",

            "content": "I had heard great things about this anime so I decided to give it a shot. I went in with an open mind. Overall I thought the anime was well done but not without it's flaws.\r\nStory: I've mentioned in a previous review the Action/Romance genre dilemma. Basically you get one or the other, rarely both, sometimes none. I feel like both story elements (action and romance) could have been done better. What this anime does have in large quantities is anime-style slapstick comedy. \r\nAction: Most of the action (really until the last episode) is very boring. The main enemies for most of the series areglowing, psychedelic lobsters/crabs/frogs called \"phantoms\". They are poorly drawn and are in no way intimidating or scary. They really serve no purpose other than to pop up and serve as target practice for Yato. To make matters worse, they insist on having Yato recite the same 3-4 line speech before he executes a sword slash (btw, 1 hit kills these phantoms) before cutting to a prolonged death sequence for the phantom. It feels like filler. Two things save the action aspect anime. First there are other struggles besides slaying these mindless drones. These other struggles are interesting but will easily bore someone who wants Attack on Titan or Darker Than Black fight scenes. The second thing the fight at the end. I won't spoil anything but it's actually pretty good and I wish they hadn't waited till the end to introduce it. If they got rid of the giant floating creatures and replaced it with God fights this anime would have rocked.\\n\\n\r\nRomance: The other side to the coin is the romance angle. To be honest, this anime forgot that it was only 12 episodes long. The pacing made Hiyori seem clingy and Yato seem completely aloof until about 3/4 through the season. My biggest problem though comes back to the 12 episode limit. It's really hard to make two characters bond in that amount of time, especially when there is no mutual struggle to bring them together. Basically Hiyori lives a normal life as a student and Yato tries to earn money. No Death game, no Invasion, no Titans. What saved this series is the possibility of a second season and more character development. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Those fucking Phantoms. It's like they lifted the voices from Star Wars and borrowed Jabba the Hut's voice and layered it with a Jawa's. It's really awful. They F'd up  the phantoms. I was also very plus minus on their sound track. The action sequences use this industrial/electronic theme that's unique but imo not too pleasing on the ears.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's Bones so the quality is pretty good. When I said the Phantoms were poorly drawn it wasn't from lack of skill, it was the creature design and style. Maybe it's just me but they looked super silly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I kept an open mind and, despite my complaints, I actually wasn't too disappointed. This is a 12 episode PG-13 anime and it entertained me.",

            "content": "Noragami is a supernatural action series with a hint of romance produced by Studio Bones. Along with Shinichiro Watanabe\u2019s Space Dandy, Noragami signaled the current wave of productivity from the studio in 2014, after a slump of low productivity and shows with lukewarm reception which lasted a few years. While not all the shows in this new wave are gems (or even good), Noragami is a keeper. Though it does stick rigidly close to genre conventions, the show casts a wide range of appeal, and effectively hits every one of its targets. It is frequently funny, continuously engaging, and on rare occasion even a littlecreepy. Most importantly, however, Noragami has a lot of heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when Hiyori, a kind-hearted teenage girl, starts having out of body experiences and meets a down on his luck god named Yato. Where most gods have shrines or attendants, Yato goes around doing odd jobs as a \u2018delivery god\u2019 charging 5 yen for his services. Hiyori requests Yato to find a way to stop her out of body experiences, Yato agrees but says it will be an extended task and will take some time. In the meantime, Hiyori gets drawn further into the world of spirits and gods as she joins Yato and his newly acquired and rebellious Shinki (spirit servant/assistant for lack of better term), Yukine, on their various assignments. All the while, Yato\u2019s dark past is slowly catching up with him.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is a nicely paced, well-rounded show. It deftly switches between action, drama, and comedy on a regular basis, and does a remarkable job keeping the tone consistent even as it shuffles back and forth. The somewhat episodic nature of the show works well to frame the world in which the story takes place, while giving the cast a plenty of time to develop, and allowing the main plotline to slowly reveal itself over the course of the series. The dialogue hits just the right balance of exposition and character interaction, allowing for explanations which further develop this world and how it works, while never really feeling tedious or dry. Dramatic and comedic moments flow naturally, giving a very good sense of who these characters are and how they interact with one another. Even when the show delves into darker material, it usually does not come across as jarring or unnatural, although sometimes a bit forceful and melodramatic. Really, the execution of the plot and all its elements is quite exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nThe strong execution here is very important because the plot, and even characters, in Noragami aren\u2019t anything particularly special on paper. Sure, its world of gods and spirits which exists side-by-side with the world we know is well developed, but it is hardly an original concept. In fact, the setting is one of the most commonly used in the medium of anime; recent shows like Beyond the Boundary and Kami-sama Kiss feature similar settings, and really, they\u2019re only the tip of the iceberg. Having a character such as Hiyori go down the rabbit hole, metaphorically speaking, and entering a world that she is not familiar with is hardly a fresh idea. Neither is Yato\u2019s goofball with a dark past backstory, or half a dozen other plot elements in the show. And yet, the material somehow shines in spite of this. The skillful yet sincere storytelling makes the plot intriguing and emotionally engaging, keeping the viewership invested in the characters and various plotlines even though it is essentially material we\u2019ve seen multiple times before.\\n\\n\r\nMost instrumental to the show\u2019s success is the chemistry between the three leads. Hiyori is a bright, compassionate, and friendly young lady. She\u2019s na\u00efve and unknowledgeable of the mystical world, yet she\u2019s proactive and responsible, always trying to help and understand those around her. In stark contrast is Yato, who seems to be purposely negligent and irresponsible. He\u2019s laidback and only occasionally takes things truly serious, despite his aspiration of being a famous and widely worshiped diety. Unlike Hiyori, Yato can be apathetic to those around him and lets things run their course, even if they lead to disastrous ends. Completing the trinity is Yukine, the confused and defiant spirit of a young teenage boy. Having died at a young age, Yukine is constantly dissatisfied with his situation, and hardly heed the advice and warnings of those around him. He\u2019s also envious of those who have things he does not and cannot have, namely a normal teenage life and friends. These three very different individuals form a makeshift family which is the emotional core of the show. They argue and hurt one another, they console and comfort each other, they have awkward misunderstandings and share laughs. Despite all coming from varied backgrounds and having clashing personalities, there is a genuine connection between the three, one which can sometimes bring them pain, but other times bring them a sense of comfort and acceptance. It\u2019s a connection that is formed through odd circumstances, but one that runs deeper than it might originally appear, and one that the three depend on as the series progresses. The threat of this connection being broken is what makes the antagonists so menacing, and the main plotline so rewarding, even though it is built on a cluster of overused tropes.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is produced by the prolific Studio Bones, and as such, the show looks expectedly stellar for the most part. The character designs have a bi-shounen/bi-shoujo flavor to them, but thankfully have the best aspects of such designs. They\u2019re attractive and expressive designs, and each character has their own distinct body language. The animation is quite good majority of the time, especially during action sequences. There are a few noticeable technical hic-ups and budget restrictions, but overall it is a very good looking show. It sounds just as nice, with well composed music which is implemented effectively. It\u2019s not a soundtrack that is going to stick in your memory or be considered one of the all-time greats, but it supports the show\u2019s content as all good soundtracks should. Likewise, the voice work from the Seiyuu is solid across the board. There isn\u2019t really a performance that stands out as great, but it is an admirable ensemble effort.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Noragami lacks in creativity and originality, it makes up in execution. This is director Koutarou Tamura\u2019s first stab at a full-length TV series, having only directed individual episodes or served as assistant director in various project previously, and it is quite an admirable one. It is clear that the staff behind this project cared about producing a quality work, and they succeeded in doing so. Noragami won\u2019t go down in history as a game-changer or anything of the sort, but as it stands, it is a great genre piece.  \\n",

            "content": "So back in January of this year, Noragami was one series I was really looking forward to. Sadly I only got to watch the first few episodes before having to turn off my internet and prepare for moving; and even after said move I only got around to watching it recently. Now since this series is adapted by a monthly manga series, I decided to read the manga portion that was covered in this anime and give my thoughts on it then. I honestly don't like comparing two forms of a series side by side, because I do believe that each one is a differentexperience for the reader/viewer, but it is really just a force of habit by now I think.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for this anime can be split into 3 parts (4 if you count the ova); the first part focuses on the first few episodes, introducing the main characters Yato, Hiyori, Yukine and the a few of the supporting cast to make reoccurring appearances throughout. The second part, personally I feel being the strongest of the series, focuses on Yato and Yukine's relationship, hints at their individual pasts and ultimately solidifies the bond between them and Hiyori. And the third part being an original ending not pertaining to the manga itself but once again drives home the message of keeping those you care about close and always thinking of their best interest. Unfortunately, the fact that this is only a 12 episode series means that a lot of loose ends aren't dealt with and left up in the air; the whole explanation of Yato's past and Yukine's death, the state of Hiyori's body and a few other things that I won't mention for spoiler reasons. The story does however accomplish making you love the relationship between the three protagonists which is still pretty good I would say.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest draw for ANYONE to this series would be the animation and music! The characters move and act very fluid and the scenery and action sequences are just eye-candy galore. The OP, ED and OST are all great to listen to and set the mood of each episode almost perfectly. The show also has a TON of well known voice actors; Kamiya Hiroshi, Yuuki Kaji, Jun Fukuyama and Miyuki Sawashiro just to name a few. \\n\\n\r\nAdapting the characters from the original story is where I have mixed feelings. For starters I would say that they made Yato and Yukine both more likable compared to the how they are portrayed in the manga; Yato is just more funny and isn't trying too hard to be the 'strong, mysterious-type' while Yukine is shown to have more of a kinder side compared to just being a 'shitty brat' when first introduced in the manga. That said though my main problem comes from the lack of depth into characters pasts and what their goals and drive are. Again, this is the fault of only being 12 episode long so I can understand that, but I feel for anime only viewers who don't read manga could very easily be left feeling unsatisfied. \\n\\n\r\nMy final 'verdict' is, I REALLY like this series; Anime AND Manga together. Like I said before there are a few problems story wise and if someone wants the whole thing wrapped up nice and neat in only 12 episodes then that someone will be disappointed. But is someone just wants an interesting series with supernatural setting, funny and amusing characters, well animated action sequences and a potential interest in a new manga afterwards than I would recommend this one to you. These are just my thoughts and if anyone feels like giving any feed back feel free to comment on my profile; I would greatly appreciate it.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so I\u2019d be very happy if you had suggestions to help me improve. I\u2019d like to point out that English is not my first language, which is in fact Portuguese, so be free to correct me if I mess up with the grammar. Let\u2019s get started:\r\nStory: 3\r\n   In my opinion, the \u201ctheme\u201d of this anime is far from original. There are monsters, the phantoms or ayakashi, which are in fact dead human beings who are stalked by the negative emotions they had on their lives. This remembers me of the hollows of Bleach. There is alsothe fact that dead human beings can transform into weapons, which remembers me of Soul Eater. \\n\\n\r\n   Now comes the plot. This anime doesn\u2019t really have a focus, it has comedy, action, and a little bit of drama. I\u2019m not saying that this itself is bad, but I found every one of those boring. 1: The comedy is not funny. It only has weak tsundere jokes, and other jokes with Yato being a failure as a god. 2: The battles with the phantoms and the other gods were also boring, it lacks emotion and \u2026 action. 3: The drama with Yukine was the best of the worst, it was silly of Yato to let his shinki do things that would hurt them both. Again, the drama would be a lot better if their respective pasts were shown. \\n\\n\r\n  The story had four \u201carcs\u201d: The first was the search for a way to help Hiyori and a shinki for Yato, the second was the Yukine arc, the third was the battle with Bishamon and the final one was the battle with Ebisu. For me, the Yukine arc was the best, it didn\u2019t had any battles, but was the only one that managed to have character development. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\n  The characters simply weren\u2019t developed, the unique exception would be Yukine, but his development was simply thrown away because he was deprived of attention during the final \u201carc\u201d of the anime. I would also like to point out that the lack of information about the past of both Yukine and Yato is sad, because the viewer become curious during the course of the anime, but in the end they can just speculate what happened.\\n\r\nThe problem with a 12 episode anime is that we don\u2019t really have the time to like the villains or the support characters, we only get to really know the principal ones, which are also boring in this case.\\n\\n\r\nVisual: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was neither good nor bad, it was average. The movements of the characters during the battles wasn\u2019t amazing but was fluid enough. I personally liked the phantoms, which were very colorful and had fluid movements. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\n  I loved the opening sound, I and started to watch the anime because of the opening. However, the ending was average and the OST didn\u2019t had very much to offer, with the exception of the song Lurk. It simply didn\u2019t had that moment in which you listen to a song and start to search for it on the OST. However, I have to admit that the songs are not that bad and fit on every moment of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4,5\\n\\n\r\n  Noragami is not that good of an anime, and is overrated by many. I don\u2019t recommend you to watch this show if you are looking for an action anime, nor if you are looking for a comedy one. \\n",

            "content": "Everyone's been in situations where someone asks them \"How are you?\", and you reply with \"Fine\", when what you're really feeling is far from fine. Noragami works in very much the same way, it comes off as a very cheery show, but holds so much more emotion behind what it shows at first glance.\r\nThe story is nothing special; an unknown God called Yato tries to gain recognition by answering the prayers and calls for help from people. Things happen to Yato and people around him that branch from that, which would be fine usually, but nearly everything that does happen to him and his friendsarises from something from Yato's past, which is never even explained. It doesn't flow very well, but at least it is entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very nice to look at, with character designs unique and animation that flows. It is very reminiscent of Bleach in fact, having the backdrop of a city/town, where Phantoms (Hollows) reek havoc on the town at nighttime, and Yato and fellow God's fight them. The fights aren't ever anything original, but they do look nice for sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are both very good. It's rare that I won't skip through an OP and end the video before the ED, but Noragami got me to sit through them, which is pretty impressive. The music throughout the show is something I've not experienced before... It's just so strange... With automated singers against very new-world synths, I can't say I always enjoyed it, but it was at least it's own style, and something Noragami will be remembered for.\\n\\n\r\nThe character's are what make this show so good, and if it weren't for their development throughout the show, I'd have dropped it easily; disregarding it as another generic action/comedy. I don't know how they managed to fit such intricate stories to Yato and Yukine, but you really do feel for them when things get dire. Hiyorin (the damsel in distress) isn't as fleshed out as the boys, but with another season, I'm sure she'd get her own spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Noragami; it's simply a lot of fun to watch. It has a great combination of comedy, action, story, packed with great visuals and a unique soundtrack. The only thing I have to say that dissapointed me was the plot and the 12 episode length. Another season with a plot that had more focus would really help this show become top-notch. Either way, this is worth your time whether you want a comedy show, an action show or an emotional ride, because Noragami fits into every category.",

            "content": "Have you ever had a sudden urge to do something evil and unpleasant to someone else?\r\nWell, to be honest, we all had. But we didn't do it, at the end. Why? Because a homeless delivery god is out there to cut those wicked intentions away. It's a very interesting concept portrayed in the story because it shows our consciousness in form of gods and add a reminder that one wrong step and you'll be succumbed by the Phantoms into another realm with no turning back, in other words - death and despair with no end.\r\nYato, is the main drive of Noragami. Noragami managed to succeedin its supernatural and shounen genre because of him with his fair share of drama and serious moments that could lighten up the ambience and increase the suspense at the same time. There's also the casual quirky action and words by the fine ensemble of gods with their Regalias that adds in the comedic value, engaging in the interaction and actions scenes to keep the story from being dull, all while centering Yato with his tiny bit of childishness. But, as silly as he seems to be, they know they can count on him whenever he's needed.\\n\\n\r\nHiyori, on the other hand, as unimportant as her character is depicted, she serves as the crucial link that bonds Yato with his problematic Regalia, Yukine. She is the cute and precious tie to their relationship. Yukine, as annoying and immature he can be, he serves as the emotional and physical support to Yato and although he does mistake, you can't blame it all on him, he's a teenager after all. Yukine is the one who brings emotions of the story to a certain point, the stubborn trouble maker that we could resonate with and yet, Yato never gives up on him.\\n\\n\r\nThe trio combined, and you've got Noragami. One for all, all for one.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the art part, the eyes stood out as they managed to capture the essential personality of each characters, with dark blue on the coldness of Yato, the bright warm orange on the impulsive Yukine and the warm pink on the active and beautiful Hiyori. For the OP and ED, the Japanese rock rhythm really sets up the mood and it's nicely structured that shows you how deep their bond goes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Noragami will make you laugh, leave your heart hanging in the air and then make you cry. It's composed of action, comedy and shounen at its finest and perhaps, even more.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it only costs you 5 yen.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Noragami. What a stellar season it has been. After watching 12 episodes of this mindblowing anime, i can say it is one of the best of 2014 Winter anime.\r\nAt first, when you read the synopsis, you would probably think this. Yea, its one those demon or phantom/ god anime where they try to kill each other or this anime seems almost like a copy of Soul Eater. Well, Noragami takes that idea and throws it in the trash. Noragami's plot is very intriguing and really interested me.Being a huge fan a supernatural or superpower animes, Norgami gives everything a superpower anime fan wants. Tons ofaction balanced with funny and serious moments.  Not only do they pace the anime very well (considering that this is a 12 ep anime) they also balance out the romance and comedy to the point where one does not completely overwhelm each other.If you are looking for a very well placed and interesting plot, then give this anime a shot.\\n\\n\r\nAs for artwork, i can say that Noragami had superb artwork. Of course, being in the 2014 season, its not a surprise. But I can say that i really enjoyed the fight scenes being animated, especially towards the end. Each episode had no drop in the quality of animation and art is one of the strongest departments in this anime. As for sound, theres not really much to tell besides the fact that they had awesome OP and ED along with excellent voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nAs for character, i believe this is the best, if not, the ultimate reason why Noragami lives up to its potential. Each character is very likable with thier own special personalities. I'm actually impressed with the writers because they managed to dish out character transformation in such a little amount of episodes. For example, without trying to reveal spoilers, each character had some sort of insecurity or past that they did not like, but then thanks to friends, they overcome these insecurities and learn from them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed Norgami as whole. Its satisfied everything that I enjoy watching as an average anime watching lover. If you enjoyed reading this review, give a thumbs up and feedback is always appreciated!\\n",

            "content": "I had heard about the rave hype from social blogging sites and was curious to check out this anime myself, and so I did. Although the run was very enjoyable and fun-filled, I was left with the same feeling when I began the series to when I finished it.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nAlthough the interaction between other characters and learning more about the Shinto belief was interesting, there is no over arching climax or exposition throughout the anime. There may be instances of character development, but that's about it that the anime (at this point) seems to provide. However, I really want to stress that the story getsbetter and starts to pick up where the anime ended, so basing the overall story on the anime is too quick to judge. After finishing the anime, I was immediately hooked and motivated to read the rest and I was glad I did! The story got so interesting that I can't wait for a new chapter and second season to come out soon!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm actually quite amazed by the art. The action scenes are filled with fluidity which greatly appeals to me, and I've also taken time to observe the backdrops/backgrounds which the production seems to add a lot of intricate detail to. I'm very fond of the mangaka's style also.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nAlthough there are some tracks that stand out than others such as 'Conversation Heart' (one of my favorites tracks from the OST), the rest are pretty mediocre at best. It does help paint the atmosphere for the viewer, which I believe the production did a pretty good job at.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI must stress in all sorts of storytelling from novels, to television shows, and to even anime/manga: strong characters are able to carry a weak plot, but weak characters are unable to carry a strong plot. In the case of Noragami, what I believe truly kept viewers going and what carried the story till the end were the characters. Not only does Yato serve as a comic relief in the anime, he is also displayed with a range of dynamics that make his character very interesting than other protagonists, the same can be said about Yukine. Although I couldn't really stand Hiyori at first because she seemed very Mary Sue-ish, I knew I had to bear with it because she served as a major character within the anime. I was very interested in the characters that I had often forgotten about the plot of the anime at times. Even though the story was  bit subtle, the character development of both Yukine and Yato caught my attention the most. I was so interested and involved in their development, it helped to connect with them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 9/10. It was a fun watch and I hope to see a second season soon because it was very interesting. After reading the manga, I'm sure more people will definitely appreciate it more than they do now, and a second season will definitely increase its viewings. I really recommend to those who have rated the anime poorly to read the manga. The manga elaborates more on the plot and the story begins to pick up after the anime. Although the pacing may be a little sputtered at times, the plot is very interesting. Not only does the story pick up, but it also begins to explain things such as Yato's past, more history/lore pertaining to Regalias and Ayakashi. All in all, if you weren't satisfied with just the anime, I really recommend reading the manga up-to-date.",

The story is not one I would have jumped at if I read it any other day but my friend suggested it strongly for me and for what it is worth - I enjoyed it.\r\nStory: Simple story for this genre - defeat the evil that no human can see with the most unmatched comrades you can find. It dishes a lot of comedy and that also makes it fun to watch. When drama and seriousness is needed, it is delivered.  Story line is set on a straight path and only strays for necessary character development which I thank theanime gods for!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: MC is lol-worthy but he is also swoon-worthy and has a badass streak about him too. I thought he would be pathetic the entire series but his past and development got me excited - not gonna lie. Hiyori and Yukine have some development missing in the first season, nothing too dramatic, but I imagine their expansion will get picked on in the second season. Some drama on both their accounts that werent all that bad - quite thrilling actually. Obviously nora has some mystery to her and Bishamon has a history I think is worth the wait as well. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Art: OP is life. Spot on. battle sequence soundtracks hit spots too and the \"in between\" stuff is pretty solid. Never listened to the ED though.. Art is very very well done - especially with the color and array of flowing movements in action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely give this anime a try! If you are after a dead-serious action anime, dont let yourself watch this.. not with preconceptions, otherwise you will be disappointed when you dont need to be! Go into this with an open mind and enjoy it!\\n",

Shrine-less god Yato strives to get recognized by scribbling his cell number anywhere he can and granting the wish of any worshiper for the low, low price of 5 yen.  I really loved Yato and was prepared to follow him on his journey to be #1 god.  But this is not what the series is about.  The series is about this annoying little girl who constantly gets in his way and causes problems in his life to the degree he almost died.  Then when she begs people to save him he is all appreciative andgrateful that he has her in his life despite her being the root cause of the problem in the first place.  A lot of unnecessary drama.  And what annoying anime chick would be complete without an episode of amnesia?  In summary Yato makes absolutely no progress in his quest and gains a truly annoying companion.  Sucky by all accounts.",

The best thing i liked is the concept that the work of the GOD is to fulfill request from People and they described that concept amazingly.  The one thing I felt that concept of central plot. I guess they will focus on it on 2nd Season.\r\nArt: Animation is decent if you compare them with other action packed. Fighting with Phantoms, among themselves. \r\nSound: Background sounds are perfect , can't be more good.\r\nCharacter: A god named yato pretty self centered is accepting any kinds of request to make hisown shrine. During it, he countered a girl half phantom half human impacts on his way of thinking.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : Concept of rivalry between gods made this anime pretty enjoyable, Other concept that I like is about after life and this life. You can't compare them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Pretty good series and recommended for those who like watching super natural thing with action.",

            "content": "Whenever I decide on an anime to watch, there are a few things I take into consideration. Sometimes it depends on my mood, sometimes I want to check out a show that has been reveled by the general populous to be good, or sometimes it is based off of the show I watched previously. Based on all of those things, a certain show called Noragami popped into mind. I needed a fun, exciting action anime to free myself up from all the romance/SoL stuff I have been watching lately. In this regard, it succeeded, but this is only a small part of what makes upNoragami, whether it be good or bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that struck me right away when watching Noragami was it's setting. It's setting is very simple yet very captivating. The world of Noragami isn't packed with so many mechanics to the point that it makes the viewer confused, but gives it enough depth to make me immersed in the world Noragami presents. The thing is, like many elements of Noragami, it doesn't get expanded to the level that I would like it to be. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I really liked about the setting in particular, as well as other aspects of this anime, was how it portrays sin. For example, I liked how the phantoms were more than just random creatures for the MC's to kill off. They themselves symbolize sin, as they cause the humans in the anime to do sinful things. \\n\\n\r\nOther than the setting, however, the story barely stands up to be anything above average. A lot of this is due to the fact of this being a 12 episode series. Other than Yukine's story arc, which I found to be the best part of the entire anime, almost all of the other plot points are not given much focus, to the point where I am left with more questions than answers. Why did Yato turn from being a god of calamity to a delivery god? Why did he kill one of Bishamon's regalia's? Why does Kazuma, one of Bishamon's other regalia's, feel like he owes Yato? These, along with so many other points of interest, are left with no conclusion, making the viewer  gasp for a second season that we may or may not get.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, we have the less than exceptional bad guy arc that takes up the last three episodes. The main antagonist has nothing much to him other than the usual \"I do bad stuff because I'm evil\" motive, which could have been solved with a better explanation of his backstory. Also, he gets introduced way too late into the series, giving him even less of an impact that he already had. That, coupled with the fact that the main herione is, once again, the damsel in distress, and you have the recipe for failure.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, let's start off the characters with the main herione, Hiyori Iki. For a good majority of the series, she is actually a good female lead. Before the shit bad guy arc, she had a strong presence in the anime, even if the presense slowly depleted as the anime chugged along. She is shown to be a very compassionate, selfless character who will do what she is able to do to help her friends, namely the two male leads, through the problems they face. I do wish she kicked some more ass like she did the first few episodes, because my god, that drop kick on that phantom's face was badass.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Yato, the peniless, shrineless, god. Yato is a bit of a mixed bag for me. Although he did grow on me as he started to develop as the series progressed, I really did not like him during the first half of the series. He just kind of came off as an asshole for the most part, talking about how people should die if that's what they want, even knowing full well that the phantoms were the main cause of the characters problems. However, this was also the fact that made me like him later in the series. He believes that doing all the work for others to face their sins leaves little impact, and he rather gives them the incentive to face their sins, while the person with the problems has to face the brunt of their problems themselves. I know I didn't explain this very well, but I hope you get what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nA prime example showing this side of Yato is Yukine, Yato's regalia. Yukine, while not the most likeable character by a longshot, has the most character development out of anybody else in Noragami. He is someone who is more driven by his emotions rather than common sense (which makes sense considering he is a young teen at a \"dangerous age\", something that the other characters bring up every so often). This makes him do some reputable things, tying back to the whole theme of sin mentioned earlier. Yes, his whining was annoying at times, but it was justified to an extent, and his stellar development and climax of his arc more than makes up for it. \\n\\n\r\nSo, the main cast of Noragami is good, but really not anything special. Each character has positive and negative points about them, but at the end of the day, they are at least enjoyable to watch. I can't say the same about any of the other characters, however. Like the many unexplained plot points, the side characters had enough personality to get me interested, but little development or even screentime to get me emotionally attached to them. I would love to know more about Nora and why she is so attached to Yato, and I crave for more depth into Bishamon's character and her and Yato's bitter relationship, but I didn't get any of it. Once again, another aspect of the show ruined by lack of time. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, there isn't much negative I can say about it. Bones has always had a nice mark of quality both art and animation wise, and Norigami is no exception. I personally liked the use of more dimmer colours to emphasize the season of winter to the fullest. And even if the character designs didn't have many different colours used, especially in Yato's case, everything else design-wise was easily above average. Also, the explosions created after a death of a phantom looked extremely cool. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, while nothing too spectacular, was refreshing while keeping the tone of whatever scene it was used in. More electronic music was used, which was very different to what we normally hear when watching battle-shounen, and it worked quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, I can't write a review of this show without mentioning the absolutely phenomenal opening theme. If I had the chance, I would totally see Hello Sleepwalkers perform. It was just that good. The ending was very good as well, even if not to the level of the opening.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as battle-shounens go, Noragami was a cut above the rest. But, there are far too many problems with the show for it not to be much more than an enjoyable watch. If there were to be a second season to this show, it has the possibility to tie up all the loose ends that were left at the end of this anime. Still, it has enough value to be recommended to people who like more action-related content, and I know that there will be people who like this show more than I do. But when looking back, all I wanted  was a fun, action anime get my mind off all the romance shows I have been watching as of late, and for that purpose, it did just fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

A second season is confirmed later this year with hopes that they at least find a main focus for the story and continue on that path.",

            "content": "Noragami, or Stray God, starts out with a typical shonen feel.  However the show quickly begins to unravel into something completely different.  A show with a great setting, unique world building, and interesting characters that all create a flavor of its own.\r\n*Story/Character-------\r\nHiyori Iki is a fairly average girl with an interesting secret.  She loves pro wrestling. Though her secrets stretch further when one day she sees a man walking in front of an oncoming bus and she pushes him to safety. As she speaks to the man, her attention is turned to the front of the bus where her body now layseparate from her. Later, after regaining consciousness in a hospital, she\u2019s surprisingly given a clean bill of health and told to get some rest. The reason why she made it unscathed is revealed later that night when the man she saved shows up in her bed.\\n\\n\r\nTurns out the man she thought she saved is actually a god. Yato is a dysfunctional god that has no shrine to call home and does odd jobs to fund his dream of having one. He points out to Hiyori that her spirit is now half way dislodged from her physical self and may detach at random. After later running into corrupt spirits named phantoms, she\u2019s informed that the destruction of her tether (that comes in the form of a tail) will cause her to pass on from the living.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Hiyori is a crucial part of the series, as the eyes for the viewer to this interesting world, the scope of the story branches further from there. Yato turns out to have quite a history as a god, though many characters may come to find it shocking. Then there\u2019s the many gods of this world and their use of \u201cequipment\u201d called Regalia. Regalia are spirits of humans that have met an early and unavoidable death. Once a god gives them a name, they form a pact with the god to be used at their discretion. This is further expanded in the relationship they carry and the burdens they can ultimately place on one another.\\n\\n\r\nCombining all of these elements with a really great cast of characters proves to be a truly enjoyable experience from start to end. I really liked Yato\u2019s silly and dysfunctional personality, then meshing that with the far more enduring plot elements that come into play late in the show made for a really dynamic character. Supporting him in the entirety of the series was Hiyori, of who I absolutely adored as a character. She didn\u2019t follow any tropes and really stood out as a lovable and level-headed character. Then there\u2019s Nora, who had a great deal of mystique about her that just made you crave for her to show up.\\n\\n\r\nAs expressed above, the real treat in this series was the way it fools you into thinking you really know the characters. They did well in designing a false sense of lightheartedness that later is transferred to a dark, gripping, and serious underlining plot. When it hits, it makes you want to see what\u2019s next around the corner. I also really enjoyed the more technical aspects that make up the gods and their relationship to the Regalia.\\n\\n\r\n*Animation------\\n\\n\r\nFrom start to finish, the folks at Bones Studio manage to create a beautiful and realized world. The characters have a great deal of detail and life to their movement that really sells the storytelling. While there was some use of CG for Phantoms, the style in which they utilized makes them blend into the world and never become off-putting. Quite a bit of the action and combat scenes also look fluent and pleasing to watch.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound------\\n\\n\r\nAnother element that makes this series stand out is the music. With a very unique and modern vocal track that is as stylish as the animation itself. I couldn\u2019t help myself but feel caught up in the more action oriented segments when the vocal tracks kick in. It also helps that the opening \u201cGoya no Machiawase\u201d is a great track that I listen to regularly.",

I don\u2019t read reviews, watch teasers, or even follow what\u2019s being released. Old or new, I check out what looks interesting, read a description, and look up its rating because more likely than not it\u2019s going to be decent. I\u2019ve been burned before, but trying anything new is a gamble. You have to play the odds because we don\u2019t have all the money and time in the world to sample everything.\r\nIt\u2019s why IMDB for movies is a much saferbet than MyAnimeList is for anime. Movies appeal to a far more diverse demographic than anime so the ratings combine into an accurate, almost objective measure of how good a movie is. Unlike IMDB, everyone on MyAnimeList gives their favorite shows 9\u2019s and 10\u2019s without stepping back and saying, \u201cIs my favorite show really a perfect 10 or am I just being a fanboy?\u201d I have favorite shows, too, but I can easily admit when they\u2019re shit.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I choose to give something a rating, I\u2019m balancing two things: if it\u2019s objectively good and if I\u2019d recommend it to you. I don\u2019t want you wasting your time because I don\u2019t want some asshole wasting my time either. I\u2019ve been disappointed by a lot of 9- or 10-rated shows so I make it a fucking mission to not disappoint you.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I have a hard time rating Noragami. I liked this. A lot even. I thought it was well-written enough with good animation. It was funny, the characters were charming, but I can\u2019t in good faith directly recommend this to you.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s set in modern day Japan. Our hero is a nearly forgotten god that takes up menial work to stay relevant. He does everything from cleaning bathrooms to killing evil spirits. To fight them, he needs a soul which he can turn into a weapon. He becomes friends with a girl who can basically do astral projection (leaving her body as a ghost). The forgotten god, the soul weapon, and the half-dead girl are the three main characters.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t know Noragami was hyped or even considered an action show. I watched without expectations, and realized it was a character story. Our hero wants to become a famous, well-worshiped god. His soul weapon is a punk kid who gets angsty a lot which was annoying, but he gets a lot of character development. And the half-dead girl hangs around, and keeps them together. They meet other gods, the rules are fleshed out, concepts are introduced, and there\u2019s a nice action scene here and there.\\n\\n\r\nThe plotting isn\u2019t the most engaging. I wasn't left craving the next episode, but I certainly wasn\u2019t bored. The quality of the writing is subtle. There isn\u2019t a scene I can point to and say \u201cTHAT'S QUALITY RIGHT THERE, BOY.\u201d It was the little moments that added together to make this show better than most.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of recommending it, I'd say give this show a shot. Two or three episodes maybe. I won\u2019t blame you if you\u2019re not feeling it and drop it. There are no plans for a season 2 so if you end up liking it like I did be prepared to accept unresolved plot lines.",

            "content": "This is only my second review and English isn't my first language so I apologize  if this isn't the best. \r\nNoragami, one of my favorite animes. I remember watching the first episode and not being very impressed. I only kept watching it for Yato, because I thought that he was a fun character. But after episode 2 I really started to enjoy the series more. So let's begin this review.\r\n Story:\r\nNoragami is a story about a god named Yato, who does not own his own shrine. To do so he fulfills people's wishes, and in return takes a payment of 5 yen, to buildhis own shrine. The concept of gods in Noragami is really interesting and so are the other concepts in the anime. The show starts off more as a comedy, but later becomes more serious with it's characters. Overall Noragami has a good story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite thing about the Noragami manga are the characters. So how good are the characters in the anime? First we have Yato, a god who works for 5 yen. He is shown to be a character who is typically very playful and childish with a sneaky side to him. But there are times when Yato appears very serious and mysterious,he can also be crude and unpredictable, although it is hinted that he can also be a cruel and merciless person. Yato is one of my favorites characters, his personality and backstory makes him very enjoyable to watch, he's a character who you really get attached to quickly. I enjoyed every minute that he was on screen.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Yukine. Yato's shinki. (Shinki are weapons for gods) Without spoiling much, at the beginning of the series, Yukine is portrayed as being a bit cold and cruel. He is clearly upset and annoyed at the fact that he died, and became Yato's weapon. His attitude may seem annoying to some viewers, but later in the series and in the next season he becomes a lot more likable and you really start to feel bad for him. Yato and Yuine do argue a lot but their bond becomes a lot stronger later in the series. Yukine is probably the one who went through the best development.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Hiyori, a kind-hearted girl who's a fan of martial arts. She's always trying to help out Yukine and Yato whenever she can even if it means that she has to risk her life. Hiyori might be my least favorite of the trio, since she doesn't have as much development as Yukine and Yato, but she's still a likable character who you root for.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some supporting characters, like the cheerful Kofuku and her shinki, Daikoku. Tenjin, the god of learning and his shinki's. Nora and Rabo, the series antagonists and the war God Bishamon and her shinki, Kazuma.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with having only 12 Noragami episodes is that characters like Bishamon didn't have enough time to develop. Season 2 did a great job of adapting the Bishamon arc that explains why Bishamon hates Yato so much, but he had to wait a whole year just to see it explained. The supporting characters are also colorful, likable and fun to watch, especially Kofuku. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that made me watch Noragami, despite not knowing anything about it, was the colorful animation. Studio Bones has done a lot of great action anime so I wasn't surprised from how fantastic the animation looks here. The scenery and character designs, Noragami really has a nice look to it. Each action scene is animated in a way that it makes the scenes exciting and fun to watch. The animation might not be the best from Bones, but it's still impressive. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nNoragami has a great cast. Characters voiced by, Kamiya Hiroshi, Kaji Yuki, \\n\r\nUchida Maaya and Sawashiro Miyuki. Every voice fits the characters great. Hiroshi does a fantastic job as Yato, knowing when to act silly and when to be serious. I could't think of a more perfect role for Yato opther than Hirosh Kamiya. And Yuki Kaji as Yukine was another fantastic voice. Even though I could find a lot of other fitting voices for Hitori, Uchida Maaya still does a great job as Hiyori. Every voice actor shines in this anime. The soundtrack is also great. It really fits with the tone of the show. The opening is performed by \"Hello Sleepwalkers\". A really catchy song with some great visuals. The ending is really nice too, but not as good as the opening. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWith great comedy, emotional moments, amazing and catchy soundtrack and opening, well-developed and likable characters, Noragami was a really fun ride for me.  I'm not saying that Noragami is the best anime ever, but everyone should give it a try. I know this is a bit cliche to say, but I really do think that the manga is better than the anime. Studio Bones did a pretty good job of adapting the manga, but they missed out some things in the first and second season. \\n\\n",

            "content": "After reading the manga...I thought that I should make a review on how this anime failed to show the epicness of it's manga counter part.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nWhile watching the anime, I couldn't help but feel disappointed with how the anime failed to deliver the intense feeling that I get while reading the manga. I couldn't feel anything while watching the anime, they added a lot of things that made it look so cliche and too girly for a shounen anime.\r\nI didn't like how they change Bishamon and Ebiso's arc and made it overly dramatic to the point of making me cringe. I also don't like howthey made Hiyori forget about Yato \"twice\" - Yato always fear that Hiyori will forget him one day, that's why he often stalked  her, he never found out about the incident in which Hiyori forgot about him and for me, it holds a very important part of the story...the day that Hiyori will forget Yato - sadly the anime ruined that for non-manga readers.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, Yato looked really handsome in the anime. However...there were times when the anime look dead or dull.. which made some episodes boring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening song is also good, it's one of those  opening songs that I wouldn't mind not skipping.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nYato: At first..I thought he was just another \"funny but cool\" shounen male lead, but he changed a lot from how he was at the start of the series. He became so noisy, whinny, a bit of an emo and he can be annoying to watch sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nHiyori: She's not your badass female lead nor the weak and annoying female lead. She's kind of like Yamato Nadeshiko with a weird side. But for some reason..I can't help but feel like she's slowly becoming more like a side character.\\n\\n\r\nYukine: He got the biggest character development in this series. Almost half of the series was spent for his character development on how he slowly change from that annoying and ungrateful brat to Yato's blessed and loyal shiki\\n\\n\r\nOverall:4 /10\\n\r\nIt's sad how the anime ruined what was supposed to be one of the best shounen manga and made it look cliche and too girly and failed to deliver the epicness of it's manga counterpart.\\n\\n",

Unfortunately, his dream is far to become real, because he doesn't have a sanctuary yet. To make matters worse the only member that he had for help solve the problems of people just give up. His lucky change when he meets Iki Hiyori, who saves his life. This fact puts Hiyori in a mess, so she stays beside himuntil the problem is resolved. With Hiyori and his new member Yukine, Yato will do all that he can for win fame, recognition and a chapel dedicated to him.\\n\\n\r\n[Opinion]\\n\\n\r\nThe story, the comedy and the characters that were presented in the first chapter were quite interesting, so I could not avoid to be completely hooked. Luckily, I was not disappointed and I enjoyed every episode.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing we have to highlight are the characters and their personalities. All of they have their point. First, Yato the God, he is so charismatic and he's one of the main characters. Him knows how to handle the comedy, and he have an history and a dark past too. His \"shinki\", Yukine becomes in a nice companion. I think his personality can irritate some people, but you have to understand him. And Hiyori, I really love she, she isn't the typical weak girl, and she have a really nice personality.\\n\\n\r\n[Animation & Sound]\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is beautiful and each chapter is noted; I adored each design and the atmosphere was more than perfect. In addition, the soundtrack is wonderful (the opening became one of my favorites). Two clean sections.\\n\\n\r\nSome things stay incomplete the serie have a 2nd season, and you can read the manga too.\\n\r\nI really love Noragami, it became one of my favourites animes, I recomend it for have a good time, I will see it again.  \\n",

            "content": "\"Hello! Thanks for calling! Fast, affordable, and reliable. Delivery God mercury1980, at your service!\" \"What, a review on Noragami, the anime?\" \"Well, I'll just give it a shot.\"\r\nI am actually not a God, just a human being. I just put the God title for fun. Anyway, let me say that Winter season anime has been the weakest season. By me just saying this, you would understand that watching and reviewing anime in the winter season is definitely a hard one for me.\r\nHowever, there are 2 anime that stood out among the crowd in the winter season. One of them is D-Frag and the other oneis the anime that I am reviewing now. So without further adieu, let's get on with the review.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (7):\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Iki Hiyori, a normal high school student, who saved Yato, a jersey-wearing person, from the bus. Unfortunately, she became a half-phantom and things happen from there.\\n\\n\r\nThe story introduces the concept of phantoms which are evil spirits that exist in the world. Evil spirits can control people's minds and trick them into doing evil things like insulting, hurting, etc... The story managed to blend evil spirits and the real world very well.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one scene whereby the phantom says \"Smells nice\". This sort of reminds me of the time when I watched Venus Versus Virus when Sumire is in her \"Berserker Mode\". The difference is that the plot is better executed in Noragami than Venus Versus Virus.\\n\\n\r\nART (7):\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was amazing. The art style was very subtle in the sense that it made the phantoms look like they are communicating to human beings.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme \"Overnight Appointment\" is a rock song that is very catchy and addictive. This opening theme was sung by Shuntaro.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme \"Heart Realise\" is a smooth song. It was composed by Supercell and was sung by Ria.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music actually fits the tone when performing rituals.\\n\\n\r\nIt was very surprising to see well-known voice actors portraying the voice very well for each characters. (eg. Rie Kugimiya voiced Nora)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (5):\\n\\n\r\nThe only good characters are Yato &amp; Kazuma.\\n\\n\r\nYato has charisma and he is also a badass when fighting phantoms. in fact, his statement \"People should appreciate the meaning of being alive\" was a good statement from him. It shows that he really cared for everyone. During the final confrontation with Rabo, he sort of reminds me of Kenshin Himura from Rurouni Kenshin when Kenshin fights with Jinei Udo.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma was also calm and collected. In fact, he was an interesting character when he was given a back story. Kazuma was voiced by Jun Fukuyama who was the voice actor for Lelouch vi Britannia.\\n\\n\r\nYukine was very annoying although he went through a development in the later episodes. In fact, I appreciated his development as a character.\\n\\n\r\nHiyori Iki at least managed to help Yato in the slightest possible way she can. However, this anime never gave her any powers to kill phantoms and bosses. She is treated like a damsel in distress.\\n\\n\r\nI always see damsel in distresses in most action anime nowadays and this really killed the enjoyment I had with the characters and the anime itself. As I have mentioned in my early review Sword Art Online that I am very tired of damsel in distresses and wishy-washy female characters. For male characters being wishy-washy, I can tolerate them to a small extent. (eg. Yukiteru Amano from Mirai Nikki)\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (6):\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I have problems with this show, I really did appreciate the way how they integrate phantoms into the real world. However, this anime didn't stand out among most anime that I have watched. I was neither surprised nor bored.\\n\\n\r\nI really didn't want to give this anime a very low rating just because of a damsel in distress, Hiyori Iki. I really try to be as generous as possible when it comes to Winter Anime Season.\\n\\n\r\nI also hope they will have an ova or season 2 to cover Bishamon's arc. It is because I would love to know more about her and especially Kazuma.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, for what it's worth I enjoyed bits and pieces of this anime and I will give this anime a 6 out of 10. If you enjoyed this show a lot, that's good. Stay tuned for more reviews to come.",

He also fights evil phantoms who try to posses people into doing by things with his trusty regalia (a weapon that serves gods) Yukkine. Together, Hiyori, Yato, and Yukkine adventure through the city as Hiyori pesters Yato to return her to normal.\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nAfter reading some other reviews on here, it seems that alot of people didn't like the story progression.

As they fight, you think \"oh so I guess this is the main plot conflict then\" (it also features them fighting in the OP as a main focus), but then we see Yato has issues with Yukkine, and as this takes up about 85% of the anime you think so this is the main plot then I guess, but then after all that is fixed, we meet some other god and things go crazy, but this is solved in like 3 episodes. As you can see, the story does indeed jump all over the place. Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to the viewer. Personally, I didn't mind it so much. I liked meeting all of the different characters and seeing a variety of things and conflicts. I know with the second season, Bishamon will be expanded upon, so I'm looking forward to that!\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nAhh the art was beautiful. It was really detailed and all the phantoms were unique in design and everything was really nicely animated. The fight scenes were super cool, but really short as well. I'm hoping in the next season they will be a little longer. However, all of the past flashbacks are the same, and they seem to appear like twice every episode, so I got tired of seeing them.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nVoice acting was great. All of the voices matched the characters well. All of the background songs and OP are great. Ending is just alright.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nIn this anime, we get to meet a lot of great and interesting gods and regalia alike, and I really wish we got to learn a bit more about them. However, I love watching the comedic and supportive relationship between Yato, Hiyori, and Yukkine, so it wasn't a major problem for me. Both Yato and Yukkine go through some major character developments as well, so it keeps things interesting and fresh. However, Hiyori is a bit of a disappointment. Although I admire her for her determination and care for our male heros, she seems to just get in the way a lot and have a bit of a useless presence. I almost wish Yukkine was cut out of the story and Hiyori was the regalia, because then maybe she wouldn't had more of a purpose. However, as it is Hiyori doesn't have any kind of unique or interesting power or addition about her that makes her stand out as a character. You would think she would develop something or learn something cool considering all of the cool fantasy stuff that's happening around her, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nFor whatever reason, I really enjoyed this anime. I finished it in about 2 days, and stayed up late to finish it last night. Personally I think it's a great short anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime, but I think this big fantasy world may have been too much for just 12 episodes. I've heard that a lot of the manga story was left out of the anime, so maybe that's why it feels a little empty and rushed. However, I think it's worth a shot, and I'm sure the second season will expand on a lot.",

            "content": "Noragami is something unexpected, something that I hadn't awaited from an anime to be. While not being something extraordinary it certainly scores well in the rannks of Animes.\r\nHello and Welcome to my Review of Noragami, lets look into the Realms of Gods - shall we?\r\nThe story has you follow Yato, a young god of calamity on his quest to help the people in need , so he can store up money to make his own temple. The problem herewith is, that he always buys stuff that he doesnt need, thus making it worthless in trying further more. The catch on this Anime is mostly thatthe Gods use wandering spirits as their weapons to slay the evil phantoms that take advantage of human needs and amplify them, sometimes so bad that they would inadvertendly kill or kill themselves to achieve their goal. \\n\r\nAnyways, Yatos weapon decides to quit on him - leaving him alone to search for a new one. On his way, he  meets unconciciously a girl called Hiyori, who was on her way home with her friends - she thinking that she saw ghosts, and then also seeing that he was about to be overrun by a bus  - she then tries to save him by pushing him out of the way. This then gives her the power to go out of her body and become a half phantom, which unfortunately is never explained why this happens. Has she a superb talent? Has she a connection to something supernatural that gave her the chance to become a half-phantom. The cast just speculates on the fact that she might have too much to do with the gods, and thus cant revert. \\n\r\nThe story then goes further until Yato has been driven into a corner , when he finally then finds his new weapon - a young boy called which he calls Yukine.. troubling him more then he ever should , yet Yato would never give up on him.\\n\\n\r\nYato himself is partly a cardboard cutout of a rather clumsy but still rightous character, you find out about his cruel past and that he decides to live on with the desire to fulfill those wishes that were given to him. Hiyori then gave him basically a ray of hope , for a normal life at the end of the tunnel. \\n\r\nHiyori on the other hand is a caring character with the tick of being a martial arts fan. And this...is unfortunately the only thing you get to know in the anime as the story only revolves around Yato, he naturally is fleshed out well but Hiyori could have deserved some more attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe one Character I certainly couldnt get along with, or at least whose desires I didnt get, are those of Yukine. What you will see at the first minute, by Yatos reaction when he got him, but you never hear why, or why he couldnt give up wanting to be human - you just see it outright happening. I dont know, maybe I missed his reasoning , but simply flatout ,,because im dead'' seemed a little unreasonable to me.'\\n\\n\r\nI dont have much to say to the Artdesign , as simply..watch it. In my opinion it deserves praising and fits the situation en point. Those creepy Phantoms especially and that also making it expecially scary at a certain scene.Sound is well done as well - the fight theme particular never goes out of my brain, which is a good job meaning that im a  big music fan. There is unfortunately no other theme that especially caught my attention.\\n\\n\r\nThen here we are already at the end of my review. I  have calculated the overall score, depending on my rating on story, art, sound and characters as naturally also my personal enjoyment and thus have given Noragami a : 7.4 which would be a solid 7. \\n\r\nAt the moment of this review, Noragami still isnt licensed - thus you have to watch the subbed version , if you want to give the series a try.\\n\r\nI thank you for reading all the way through, and hope that this review could help you in the choice if you would like to watch Noragami. See ya next time!",

I would call Yato any day! :D But nooo\u2026.I live in the real world where no spirits exist\u2026or do they? Dun dun DUNNNNN!\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nIf I received five yen every time a demon/god/spirit sort of show was created, I would probably have\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026probably over 100 yen or something. Either way, this plot is overused. Clich\u00e9, but very, very addicting none the less. There is some sort of suspenseful addition in this anime. Perhaps it\u2019s because the characters seem so\u2026weak and yet theycan destroy a whole city if they want. There is also the hilarity of it all too. This girl just wants her body back and yet this all powerful God nobody has heard about is just ignoring her all the way making her follow him to gods knows where. The conflict being man vs. God or God vs. God\u2026.uh\u2026strange conflict\u2026also brings the interest level up since the antagonist is a little girl. Yeah\u2026it\u2019s a strange dilemma.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSo pretty! I loved the design of the characters, the brightness of the artwork and colour, the background\u2026it was all so original! It brought out the new style in anime. It\u2019s fresh!  It\u2019s new! It\u2019s very shiny. The character designs are the same. They\u2019re a style I actually like. Seems like the animators understand that not all anime needs to have colourful, big eyed characters. This is what I like to see. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voices of these characters weren\u2019t bad. They really weren\u2019t. I am currently watching Noragami: Aragoto in subbed of course, but I\u2019ll be re-watching it when it\u2019s in dubbed. The voice actors were very well picked and they really match the character\u2019s personality well. I\u2019m impressed with it! The opening song\u2026now Hellow Sleepwalkers\u2019 Goya no Machiawase is one of the best opening song I\u2019ve ever heard. It was catchy; it set the tone of the anime well. I loved it! Perfect opening!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved Yato. As you can see, he\u2019s currently on my favourite character list. Reason? He\u2019s funny, he acts silly and can be a total idiot sometimes, but he\u2019s probably the strongest character in this anime, and of course\u2026he\u2019s a BLOODY GOD! He doesn\u2019t try enough with his powers I feel. And because he\u2019s a God, he has so much potential in Aragoto. The other thing is his eyes! They are so\u2026.beautiful! Okay\u2026enough of the fan girling. His past has an interesting start. I\u2019m really excited to know more and more about him! \\n\\n\r\nYukine is absolutely adorable! As a shinki, this guy as a lot of potential to become a powerful weapon. I have a feeling Yato will train him in a hidden way to become so. The relationship between these two are growing too. Their brother/brother relationship shows that these two hold a strong bond from the beginning. I would love to see Yukine before he became a shinki. His past does seem somewhat interesting. \\n\\n\r\nHiyori is probably one of the only female main characters I actually like. I find it hilarious she goes out of her body without her knowing. She also has a bond between these two boys that cannot be broken. Although it might be tragic when this all ends, I\u2019m very interested in Yato and her\u2019s relationship. They have some what a romantic connection. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters have a development ongoing. This second season will determine what these characters will do and perhaps the outcome. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime. Although it might not be on my favourite it is in my \u201cmight not be my favourites but still pretty awesome anime\u201d list. I couldn\u2019t stop watching this, and could probably watch it over and over and over again. I enjoyed this a lot, and I\u2019m excited for what is to come in the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nI give this an 85% on the God scale. \\n",

With my personal preference being action that doesn't take over the entire anime, I was pleasantly surprised and by the end I was begging for more. The characters are obviously flawed and imbalanced but I believe that is what makes them great. This is the type of Anime that needs more, I feel as though there are more stories to be explored with all of the great main characters, and also astounding background characters that could stand on their own. If you like a bit of action and comedythis is the anime for you. While one particular part never out weighs another.",

            "content": "Exactly two months ago today I stumbled across Noragami, three episodes in and I was kind of worried about starting it because I am very bad at keeping up with ongoing anime series but I am so unbelievably glad I did start it. It's not one of my favourite anime series of all time.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nNoragami actually has quite a unique plot considering Gods have been portrayed hundreds of times in anime. It uses comedy a lot which makes the seriousness behind some topics brought up in the anime like suicide and bullying seem much more powerful.  \r\nArt 9/10\r\nI loved the art style of Noragami!Everything had a smooth, neat design and the colours used definitely enhanced the atmosphere to each scene (dark colours for fights with the Phantoms, light colours for times at Kofuku's, etc.) and the horrible, clashing colours of the Phantoms really did bring out how terrible they are supposed to be, which I liked a lot. The characters designs were very good too.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is my ringtone, I loved it that much! The ending theme is also on my phone. Both were amazing in my opinion, but as said in previous reviews, that is all down to music taste. I think the seiyuu's were wonderful; Yuki Kaji as Yukine especially! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I adored each different character and their personalities and different little quirks, I would have loved to learn a little more about each of their backstories like we do in the manga. We know the bare minimun about each character in the past but since Noragami was only 12 episodes long then I feel it isn't too big an issue. Despite this, all the characters are extremely lovable! They are all unique and watching the relationships grow between characters as the story progresses was one of my favourite things about the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 \\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really, really do feel this is one of the best anime I have ever watched so if you have some free time and haven't watched this yet then you really should!",

            "content": "Aimless, boring, stupid. This is probably the first anime I've ever dropped so far in (other than three episode rule situations).\r\nThe concept seems ok at first. Gods battling ayakashi (tormented souls, essentially), whilst simultaneously doing jobs in order to gain worshipers that keep them existing. The trouble with this is that it is not explained (at least in the 7 episodes I could handle) why these ayakashi need to be dealt with or why the pantheon of Gods even needs to exist. Regular humans can't even see the demons so it doesn't really effect them. Basically, there is no ultimate goal for the Gods.\r\nYato spendshis days doing odd jobs to get by alongside battling ayakashi, and the joke is that these jobs are not very Godly, such as cleaning bathrooms, minding shops etc- in order to gain followers. This joke is not played out particularly well though and falls quite flat for me. Hataraku Maou-sama! does a similar set up much better, with the devil working at McDonalds, but this is funny because it conflicts much with his prideful and evil over the top personality as the devil. Yato simply isn't that likable as a character, and so a bum doing bum-tier jobs just isn't that funny.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, where as Maou has some kind of character development from pompous devil-king to kindhearted fast food worker, Yato remains the same rather dull, mean-spirited guy.\\n\\n\r\nI will cut short my review as I haven't seen the whole anime, but all I am really trying to get across is that Noragami is essentially a much less funny and interesting version of Hataraku Maou-sama! and I would heartily recommend you to watch that instead.",

So there's this god, Yato. He's a god that is slowly losing follower to his shrine so in order for people to remember him he does job for people for only 5 yen. Now one might ask \"do we follow him on his jobs for a story?\" Thoughi think that would be a interesting concept there's more to the show then that which in my opinion hurt its but hey, let's continue.Every god for some reason is supposed to fight random creatures people can't see and stop them from screwing up the world, they do so with souls that are now dead but pure that are still wondering around earth of which they can turn into weapons, (kinda like soul eater but lamer). Yato loses his only weapon one day because a soul weapon can defect from a god (...what?) and has to find a new one, his new weapon and our ACTUAL MC are what really start to make the show go to down in the ratings. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Yatos weapon is an annoying little brat-- I mean, a teenager he names Yukine, this kid isn't really happy about his circumstances and wants to live again so he acts his age and pouts and whines about it to the point he literally causes pain (i won't say how to avoid spoilers). BUT WAIT, we didn't talk about our MC yet have we, why you may ask? Because she was so forgetful and enabling that i almost completely forgot she existed. Apparently teenage girl Hiyori one day passes out and finds she can become a spirit thing and leaves her body to become said spirit thing like in insidious with the same set of issues. She meets yato who practically nobody can see (MIRACULOUSLY) and follows him along on his misadventures with Brat boy. She i guess helps them, but only verbally really, she also screws shit up but hey MC am i right?! (they fix a lot of stuff in aragato). I enjoy yatos character and the god of misfortunes character somewhat in the show but thats all so 3/10 because i'm being nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: eh, i really didn't see anything standoutish, in fact it was less them standoutish honestly. 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening is good but nothing else was noteworthy, 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I felt like was in pain going through this show, not really any enjoyment, i liked seeing Yato and the god of misfortune doing stuff, but the rest was just bad, 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10 I felt at times i needed to force myself to continue to watch it and that should be enough to say how bad it is honestly 3/10. \\n\\n\r\nLet me tell others 2 things, 1: I will not tell you or encourage you to give the same rating, this is just my personal opinion on this show and 2: honestly I\u2019m doing this review and other reviews as a hobby and for my own \u201canime records\u201d so to speak, so if you see this and don\u2019t like it just ignore it honestly because its more for me then to help others in the long run.",

            "content": "SHITTY REVIEW\r\n-shamelessly presents-\r\nNoragami(sub)\r\nNoragami is an anime that some people may find unique or common. It can be seen as a  typical shounen anime, yet there are some elements that make it a little different from them.\r\nStory 10/8 - Noragami is a tale about Yato, a stray god ( Hence the name nora-stray and gami-god.), who does not own his own shrine. To do so he fulfills people's wishes, and in return takes a payment of 5 yen (The price of an incense stick.) to build his own shrine. The concept of gods in fiction has always interested me; so I instantly liked Noragami. Whileit may have some interesting concepts, Noragami still has its share of all-ready-used concepts such as creatures that cannot be seen by humans that feed on negative emotions, and weapons being personified. Overall Noragami has a good story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/8 - When I watch the trailer it reminded me of Madhouse. The character design is great, and has an overall feeling that makes it unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 - I really loved the OST of Noragami. Noragami mainly consisted of beautiful soundtracks, and the voice acting was nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10 - Yato was a nice shounen-like protagonist (Man, he made me LMFAO many times.) Yuki on the other hand annoyed me a little bit, but still was an ok character. Hiyori, she is your \"nice girl\", but gets tsundere at times. The other characters were not very special, but they still were great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 - I enjoyed Noragami. It was very funny with some serious elements.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 - If you are a person who does not mind cliches, and are okay with shounen anime; then I recommend Noragami to you.",

            "content": "This is my first review and English is not my first language, so please bare with me.\r\nI must say, I started and ended Noragami on the same day. Perhaps art is not the most atractive thing on this show. Ayakashis have strong colors, are well-developed and dynamic. However, this is not as good when we talk about the main characters. You will look at Yato and say \"What? This is how a God looks like?\". His appearance is not strong or powerful. Then you will see his eyes, which have everything his apparence doesn't, and understand (\"okay, maybe he doesnt look like it and doesntact like it but...\"). Eyes really are the mirror of the soul, even in anime. Pros and cons included, Yato is the series' engine. Deities, humans and akayashis revolve around him. \\n\\n\r\nSo will watch episode after episode and find this character really charming. And, wow, girls who can kick ass! Yukine is kind of annoying but he's a pre-adolecent, so it's understandable. It's frustrating how he acts, I disliked Yukine for a good part of the anime. Hiyori and Yato were amazing, though. I found their dinamic really enjoyable and pleasant. Hiyori is somewhat relatable. She fights and runs and gives and expects nothing in return. Maybe this is why you'll find her bland.\\n\\n\r\nBoth main and supporting characters have very distinct personalities. I would have liked to know more about Kofuku and Bishamonten, flashbacks, past, feelings,... something! Why do all these deities appear in the anime? Why are they trying to help or destroy Yato? What does Tenjin have to do with anything? Why does this anime never answer any of my questions?\\n\\n\r\nIt seems to be that either I didn't put much attention to the show or this series doesn't go as deeper as I wish. We have brief explanations to why this is like that but we don't have a final response. That's not good. The plot will leave you unsatisfied because it doesn't reach any conclusion, but that's what catched my atention in the first place: enjoyable show, episodes that doensn't go any further and \"to be continued...\", good characters,... This changed when the show changed. The show wants to go further? Well, go fully. Don't get me wrong, I did like the story, what I didn't like that much is that it didn't go deeper when it had to.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, this series is so intense I can't say I dislike it. I like passionate things, the soundtrack is not what I'm used to but it fits very good with the show. I like that electronic vibe, it provides dynamic and movement. I can't say much about it since the soundtrack is not what catched my attention the most. I do remember it wasn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this intesity comes in bursts. Again, this anime won't answer any of the questions you have. But it'll make you enjoy. This is the first series I watch after months. Maybe that's why I liked it so much, I don't know. It sure has a lot of flaws, both animation and story are not strong points, soundtrack is good but not memorable, but characters and enjoyment are a big \"yes\" from me. This series is not a masterpiece, but is not as bad as you may read.",

I get it most of the times by perfect animated backgrounds and the sound of japanese crickets in the summer.\r\nNoragami gave me that feeling with every episode.\r\nIt's the heartlighted happiness that the main character Yato chose, besides his struggling of keeping alive as a god without any followers, that catched my heart. And while the anime continues you get to know what absolute coolness lies within this slackish behaviour, because boy has he some background...\r\nHe slays phantoms, dark and sinister beings that turn humans intovessels of their negative emotions and cleans toilets and all for the ammount of Five freaking Yen.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that makes Noragami not a diamond so perfect that it blinds might be the story part.

            "content": "Story : 10/10\r\nYou know how certain anime just to be interesting make an overly complicated story, which unless you are Fate/Zero kinda kills the whole anime? Well in Noragami, you are not going to have huge episodes of explanation, the information regarding the story is well spread along the anime. Other than that, the story is completely original, and has a clever twist to it. It doesn't have that \"Episode 11 *unexpected* plot twist\" episode, and the story is not rushed in any way.\r\nArt : 10/10\r\nThe art is Majestic. All the characters are well reflected by their appearance, and every person who says that Yatolooks lousy is completely missing the point in character design. The art at moments when needed gives that chilly aura to the Ayakashi, and when not needed, complements the \"zen\" part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGod damn the opening is catchy! The ending for once doesn't suck, and is actually good. And the voice acting is perfect. The voices were chosen perfectly for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, one of the best character roster I have ever seen. You know when people complain about how the main character is usually \"The sole survivor of an ancient super powered human race than were exterminated\", well Iki Hiyori is just a casual high school girl, who gained the power to temporarily go into spirit form. She is not useless, but is used to develop other characters like Yukine, and every person who says she is useless misses the point. Yato is just perfect. He is a comic relief and a badass god at the same time. Yukine is just what he is supposed to be, a misunderstood teenager. I could go on and on talking about how every character is perfectly built and developed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI am not even a fan of the Shounen and Supernatural genres, and I still enjoyed this. This is not one of those anime you are gonna watch just cause you're bored, and in no way are you going to cringe at this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10/10 \\n\r\nWould I recommend Noragami? Hell yeah I would!",

Personally i loved the main character, Yato, because of it's way to be considering that he is a god xD. \r\nAlthough it's size (12 eps) it has a nice development either in the action and in the characters. \r\nIf you like crazy stuff and ifyou are looking something different, bet on this one. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is good, not brilliant as well but you will laugh a litle bit. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, i gave it a 8 because the sound is nice, so as the art. Personally, i loved the opening and the plot. I recommend for those who have a open mind, because can be hard for you to acept the story here if you don\u00b4t like fiction and everything related to it.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only bad thing, it's because of it's size, it couldn\u00b4t go deep enough into the plot so at the end at least i felt like \"i wich it could have more eps for explore the plot\" because they don\u00b4t explore it that much ..",

            "content": "This review will no doubt be consumed in my personal bias and favors, but I can clearly state that \"I love Noragami.\"  I watched the whole series within a night never losing interest in every single moment.  Noragami I'd say is a combination of the action, slice-of-life, and super natural genres.  One they I'd like to say is that though action is not a main focus what so ever, its so beautifully animated and executed that its a reason alone to watch Noragami.\r\n7/10\r\nThe plot of Noragami is not at all driven.  In a sense there really is no story but moreof a foundation for the premise of Noragami's world and for the characters.  Yes it is fairly exciting and extremely interesting but the simple fact is, nothing's really happening in terms of a story, but rather in terms of character development and setting.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nThe animation is beautiful and probably one of Bones' best works in terms of graphical fidelity.  It's overall done really well and gives life to every Character's expressions, movements, and how they interact with the world.  Definitely a selling point for Noragami.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nNoragami does not skimp out on music at all.  Not only is the opening frustratingly addicting but the soundtrack has a lot of unique style (that reminds me a lot of Persona at some points) and accompanies every event wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nCharacters is definitely a strong aspect.  Not only is every character unique and loveable, but they're all characters you can relate to.  Noragami's presents many underlying themes than tie in to real world struggles whether it be isolation or escaping one's past.  Characters are extremely funny for comic relief, but they are so many layers to them underneath.  The complexity of the characters is central to the course of the Anime.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed everything about Noragami.  It made me laugh, cry, and filled with awe and excitement.  Noragami is just a plethora of the feels and good times.\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend that anyone that is an enthusiast for anime, even if you're of the pure shounen race, to check out this anime.  Watch it and decide for yourself how good it is, outlying my personal bias.",

            "content": "So Studio Bones was able to make a great anime in 2014! Just not the one everyone expected...*flashes an image of Captain Earth*\r\n\tNoragami is just an extremely solid show, with no real significant flaws in either its story-telling or in the presentation of that story. It\u2019s benefited by having a very intriguing premise, as our main character is actually a minor god named Yato who doesn\u2019t even have a single shrine. Because of this, he pretty much becomes the Gintoki of the gods, doing whatever odd jobs he can find for a mere 5 yen so that he can slowly build up his wealth andone day realize his delusions of grandeur.  Our other two lead characters are Hiyori, a sweet high-school girl that Yato saves from dying in a car accident, only too accidently gain the ability to separate her spirit from her physical body and be dragged into the world of gods and phantoms, and Yukine: an angsty teenager who has the ability to transform into a weapon that Yato can use in order to fight against Phantoms: which are your typical Hollow/Kishin/Apparitions/bad souls that you find in pretty much anime about the spiritual realm. All three of these leads receive great development throughout the show, leading to each of them feeling like fully-fleshed out and rich characters. The character dynamic between our three main characters are an absolute blast to watch as well and ends up being the best and most balanced Power Trio from this year. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe story\u2019s sort of a mix of the Monogatari franchise and Soul Eater, since while it\u2019s similar to Soul Eater in that there\u2019s the whole \u201cpeople that are weapons\u201d thing going on, a lot of the plot focuses more on the character\u2019s backstories and drama related to spirits like in Monogatari. As is the case with both of its counterparts, Noragami is able to balance comedy and serious moments almost effortlessly, leading to you having a show with both some great emotional scenes and hilarious light-hearted moments. So if you\u2019re a fan of either of these series, you\u2019ll probably find yourself enjoying Noragami. \\n\\n\r\nAnother similarity to the Monogatari series is that this show possesses a very unique and appealing art style. Every character design is unique and gorgeous to look at and Bones returns to form in order to bring us some downright amazing animation whenever the action ramps up in the series. Alongside an appropriate score, incredible voice acting, and a super catchy opening, there\u2019s really nothing to complain about in the technical side of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nReally, the biggest flaw in this show is that it really deserved more episodes than the twelve it got. It has that typical just \u201cFull-Stop\u201d ending you get in a lot of ongoing manga adaptations and it just left you wanting more from this series. Still though, even with a lackluster ending, Noragami ends up being a great anime that is definitely worth the watch. And if we\u2019re lucky, we might get a Season 2 in the near future! \\n",

The art style is amazing too, I especially love the animation after a phantom gets cleansed.\r\nThe characters are pretty interesting, especially the gods and their ungod like behavior.

            "content": "Noragami is a short 12 episode series, featuring gods, \"dead\" humans, demons, and a girl who is half demon, half girl. In many ways a lot of these basic premises are similar to the Bleach anime. The demons (called Akayashi or Phantoms) are like hollows. Gods have special powers and some even fight each other with special weapons. One protagonist is half and half of both worlds, and death is a common theme. Shaman King strikes me as another similar example off the top of my head. \r\nNone of that is necessarily a bad on it's own. The god aspect helps explain things that wouldotherwise be impossible to. The ideas themselves I've always been attracted to, and this series definitely piqued and maintained my interest throughout. \\n\\n\r\nYet the story is simply average at best, and sadly it uses too many common tropes and handles them too poorly not to notice. When a god needs to be stronger for a fight, they are; when they need to be weaker, they are. Dialogue, which was mostly utilized correctly early in the series, eventually made recurring mistakes which too many anime insist on repeating. Excessive monologuing and ham-handed progression makes the final part fall on it's face.\\n\\n\r\nPrimarily, however, the plot's main problem stems from the lack of an overarching goal or reason to move forward. Two of the three main characters, Hiyori and Yato, are both unfortunately lacking. Hiyori, the half human, half Akayabashi girl has no reason for following Yato, and nor does she have any reason in general for being around other than as an occasional plot device. Yato is a god whose only motivation is to one day have enough money for his own shrine, which is great and all, but why should anyone care? I alluded to it earlier, but he also suffers by being a character whom becomes strong whenever it's needed. No other character gets anything noteworthy about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe one exception is Yukine, the gem of the series. Not only is he designed beautifully as a teenager with blonde hair and glowing orange eyes, he is by far the most developed character in the series. First introduced as a naive teenage boy, he is made into a divine instrument by Yato early on, as the God's weapon. But he is also a dead human with no purpose other than to serve his master, and as a result, is left questioning his own existence. He experiences a wide variety of common emotions, such as greed, lust, loneliness, and despair, making him the easiest character to sympathize with.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, the series is fine. Even despite being poorly developed overall, the entire cast is designed nicely, even if nothing else stands out about it. Nothing noteworthy to mention about the sound or songs either, but the voice-acting was good (subs). I didn't watch the dub.\\n\\n\r\nWere it not for the superb development of Yukine, it'd be hard to recommend the series. Too many promising aspects are undercooked and ultimately fall victim to overrused tropes. Even so, the enjoyment value and development of Yukine are reason enough to enjoy the series. I quickly followed up with the second season.",

            "content": "Noragami is one of those anime I completely forgot to review. I'm smart, aren't I? My reviews cover my opinions and don't focus on being factual. If my opinions are not to your liking, I personally do not give eight shits. Let's start.\r\nNoragami was made a few years ago, a.k.a, last year. A long time ago, I know. Now since I only started watching anime at the start of this year, I didn't get to watch the anime when it was airing. Personally, I hate watching anime whilst its airing, so I'm glad I made it in time when it was just finished.\r\nConsidering a newseason of Noragami will be released soon, I thought I'd do a review of the first season just before the second season comes out. Why? It's pretty obvious. To convince people to watch the series just before the next season releases? No idea.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've covered a couple of things, let's get this review started.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is about a god named Yato, also known as \"Yatogami\". Now, I personally never understood why the anime was called Noragami, besides the fact that there is a character called \"Nora\". But, Nora isn't a god, she is a Shinki, or \"Regalia\" in English, which are dead humans that can turn into weapons. Along with that, let's actually start what the story is about.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is about a god called Yato, who has a minor shrine, or rather, none at all. He grants wishes across the world for only 5 yen, and sometimes, when he puts them fingers up, he gets mistaken for \"50,000\" or \"500\". I think that happened once, my memory is garbage. Anyway, he and his Shinki, Tomone, used to do that, then Tomone is like, \"Bitch I quit\" and Yato is like \"fine bitchstick, i no need u\" and then she leaves.\\n\\n\r\nYato is about to get run over by a bus and a woman called Hiyori saves him. He didn't need to be saved, considering he is a god. But, Hiyori didn't give shit, nor did she know that he was a god, so GG. By doing this, this caused Hiyori to get a power to turn into a ghost for some reason. And from time to time, she accidentally leaves her body and sleeps.\\n\\n\r\nYato needs to look for a new Shinki, so one day, which is about Episode 3, he finds a Shinki called Yukine and fights with him. Gods need a Shinki to fight things, so that's why he got Yukine.\\n\\n\r\nI should explain, Shinki's are humans that can turn into weapons, but those humans are dead and also known as \"loose souls\". Gods need Shinki's to fight off phantoms, or ayakashi. The Phantoms feed off the darkness in people and corrupt the good in their heart. Therefore, by killing the Phantom, the person returns to normal. Good 'nuff.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is decent, actually, it's quite good. This anime was from 2014, so the art style and animation is quite recent. Literally. 1 year ago. It's not that different to the ones we have now.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also very good, though I didn't get a good listen to it, because I watched it in the lounge room where my family members wouldn't shut the fuck up and I couldn't hear shit. But, I listened to the entire soundtrack on my own once, and it's FUCKING awesome. I advise you listen to it, if you're bored one day.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good, especially all the main characters you have to deal with. I had mixed feelings with Yukine, because he acted like a dick in early episodes but in the future episodes he started acting normally. So, I ended up liking him in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is great, especially for a Supernatural/type thing. This was like, my 10th anime I watched, and yes, it was that long ago. This made me get into the 'Supernatural' genre, and eventually, I was into every genre except for ecchi, cause' it's weird. Anyway, I hope my opinions got to you, and bye-bee!",

            "content": "Action comedies are a popular genre but they rarely manage to hit the right balance between the action and comedy parts. Noragami is special as it manages to make a incredibly smooth transition from an all out comedy into an action packed drama.\r\nIn the beginning we are introduced to Iki Hiyori who, while searching for a stray cat, jumps in front of a car trying to save our other hero, the tracksuit clad god Yato. While she sustains no serious injuries her spirit sometimes escapes her body and can move around independently. While she is still in the hospital she catches Yato checking up onher, who then explains to her that he is a barely known god without a shrine and does work for anyone prepared to give him a contribution towards building a shrine. They hit it off quite well and she hires Yato to help her stop escaping her body.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself starts of in a unbelievably lighthearted manner, it just oozes this positive energy. Then we witness the gradual descent into darkness as the story becomes darker and darker, but manages to transition so seamless that I managed to forget that this was ever a comedy until the very end. This transition is not uncommon in anime but the transitions are rapid and normally seem forced because of that like in Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica, while it was a great show I never managed to enjoy it as much as I enjoyed Noragami. There are some problems in the story and a few questions go unanswered, the ending could be executed better but overall the storytelling is exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are positively awesome. First tracksuit wearing god Yato, who has to be one of the most original and funniest characters I have seen. His shameless upfront personality, his reactions on the ridicule of others and his extreme enthusiasm for doing meaningless jobs. I just cannot forget him spray-painting his adverts for his \u201cdivine\u201d assistance. This is how he is in the beginning but later on the story starts to slowly get darker and darker and he changes appropriately and some of his dark secrets start coming out. Hiyori is this average playful high school girl without a care in the world before meeting up with Yato. Her personality would be best described by that of a  young cat and even the animation emphasises that as her spirit form features this nice tail. Through the anime her personality remains the most static, but we can get to know her caring side while she is worrying about Yato and Yuki. This brings us to Yuki, Yato\u2019s divine instrument. He is a untainted spirit who Yato can make transform into a sword with which he can use to fight evil spirits. Yuki is a young boy who is extremely stubborn and selfish in the begging but later on changes into a respectable character. We also have several other side characters all of which are at leas interesting if not amazing, my favourites have to be the god of poverty Kofuku and her divine instrument Daikoku. She has the form of a young girl while he is this gruff middle-aged man who is completely devoted to her.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami also deserves praise in the art department as the animation is just beautiful if not particularly original. The characters look great and feel distinct, the animation is smooth and the backdrops detailed and lively, the fights beautifully choreographed, so all in all I have to say I was really impressed by the look of the anime. I would have to point out just how beautiful eyes the individual characters have and that manages to make Noragami stand out of the crowd. I haven't even noticed the soundtrack, which is in my opinion great, as that means that there was never a moment where it felt out off place. The opening was exceptional and quickly made it\u2019s way into my iTunes library while the ending is pretty great as well.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is not perfect but it manages to get pretty darn close, the balance of seriousness and comedy is about as close to perfection as you can get and while there were a few problems and a mediocre ending it still deserves a 9 out of 10. I can wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone and I am already waiting for the second season to come out.",

            "content": "Before starting with this review i want to say that it will cover both season, Noragami and Noragami Aragoto, however, i will try not to spoil anything of any season.\r\nYato is a god, and because he is a god the reason of his existence is to fulfill the wishes of normal people. The problem is that a normal wish needs not only a God, yet by a Shinki (a human soul that can transform into a weapon by being called by its god) and the god itself. \r\nThat is the problem that follows Yato, his last Shinki quit her job and he is unable tofulfill those wishes by himself. The reason of the necessity of a weapon is simple, if you feel depressed, angry, nervous, or any bad feeling it creates an Ayakashi. Similar to a Shinki an Ayakashi is a spirit but in this case those spirit represents those moods. To make the wish come true, the god needs a weapon in order to kill the Ayakashi that has the intention of doing bad things to the people.\\n\r\nNoragami starts like that but the reason for Yato of doing such things is for fame, yes, thats it, he wants to be recognised as a god and want people to pray him.\\n\\n\r\nIn general the story is very good, it has a good progression and its interesting and its good to see a shonen where you dont need +20 episodes to see a clearly improvement. The synopsis can or can not convince you to watch the series, but it doesnt really matter because it doesnt focus a lot in killing Ayakashis but it has side characters as well with their stories.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters is where i think this series shines the most, they are all likeable, they are all funny and their are all important, its normal to find animes where there are 5 characters in the complete series and thats it, the rest are useless and boring, well, this doesnt happen in Noragami, every character has its back story and their reason to  be there.\\n\r\nAnother positive aspect of the characters are, as I said before, their backstories, we now only some things about some characters, but the way they relate each other in the past as gods or spirits is interesting and i find it very clever from the author of the manga because it can create relationships between them in so many different ages and it wont seem like it has been pulled out of nowhere.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about the animation i have to said that is good enough, it surely isnt the best but its good, I have to say, however, that Noragami isnt a shonen where you need flashy animation because even if it involves supernatural creatures and spirits, it only uses swords or guns as weapons, no magic or anything like that.\\n\r\nDespite the fact its surely isnt the anime with the most flashy fight scenes, the animation is fluid and correct though and it shines when it has to.\\n\\n\r\nI think that the worst part of this anime comes from the Soundtrack, itself its amazing, the songs are catchy and the style of Japanese/Indian/Arabic music is truly good, but, have you seen the error?. If not, i will tell you. This is a story based on the Japanese folklore,one their religion, the Japanese Budism, well, its not like it variates a lot from the others in a general view, but it has to do with their gods, as they differ depending on the location and variety of the Budism so in terms of music, some folk music and less of Arabic style would have been better in my personal opinion, but dont get me wrong, the soundtrack is pretty good and there are some songs that accomplish my condition.\\n\r\nApart from that, i think the vibe of the music is also something that could have been better, being the setting the actual world, i think the correct thing would have been to make the vibe more youthful, like more funky music or a rock style like in the openings, that I think they transmit that feeling, there are also some songs with those vibes but those are 2 or 3 songs in a 24 songs OST.\\n\r\nThe other tendency of this OST are the creepy songs that are put in scenes related to the Ayakashis, i personally love them and think they are exactly what those scenes need.\\n\r\nThere are also some dramatic songs but they are your tipical Piano solo, they are OK, but nothing unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment this anime truly is enjoyable, its has a lot of humour and jokes yet also some dramatic scenes and the accion scenes are very good too, it also has to do with a bit of romance so it covers a lot of genres.\\n\r\n I personally like this anime, but I dont consider it something that new or fresh, it offers an enjoyable ride with good action and good characters, nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPD: If you plan to watch this anime, please stop Noragami at episode 9/10, after that it starts with a totally invented story without sense. After that continue at Noragami Aragoto.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The story just hooked me in from the very first episode, and trust me that usually never happens. It made me wanting more because it was so intriguing, heart-breaking and hilarious. I honestly cannot compare this to any other anime because it stands out on it's own phenomenally. I felt all the joy, the laughs, the struggles and the pain the characters were going through in each single episode, it pulled my heart strings inmore ways than I could have ever imagined. Every time I finished an episode I had to go to the next, needless to say I watched the whole season straight through because I could not stop, I had to know what would happen next. Though I will admit, I wish they had gone greater in depth with some of the characters (their backstory) because some seemed to just be there for the stories sake to connect together. However, that does not mean it did not ruin the stories progression in anyway, it was just a little chunk missing to complete the story in whole. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is very different and interesting that it had me glued to my computer to find out more about this world and what would happen next. The art is also beautiful, very bright and vibrant but it also had soft, somber moments when necessary it certain scenes. The music is on point, I would love to have the soundtrack to listen on repeat. The characters are so charming and riveting that I fell in love with almost all of them, though some lacked backstory which left a bit of a gap but it does not take away their role in the anime. Did I enjoy this anime? A thousand times yes. This anime is one of the best I have seen thus far and I would watch it again and again because of its charm, humor and all the emotions I felt through the series. A++++",

            "content": "What would happen if there were so many gods out there that people slowly started forgetting more than half of them? I don't know. I just needed an opener to this review. \r\nNoragami was one strange ride. Riddled with kind of a bad story, coupled with some great characters, accompanied by decent art and solid sound, it's really hard not to like for what it is. It kind of sucks you in, despite its flaws, and ultimately you end up feeling as if the time spent watching it was a good waste - but waste nonetheless. So ... why such a high score? Let's dwellinto it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is ... ah, the story is bad. I want to say otherwise, but can't. Events pop out of nowhere, alongside the characters, and cheap sub-plots suddenly appear just to keep the anime moving. Instead of going with the premise - Yato building  his name as an unknown deity, that part of the story is quickly disregarded for some other stuff that don't exactly ... go well. I'll try not to spoil anything, but be  warned: some minor spoilers are possible. \\n\\n\r\nIt is not the lack of story that draws back this anime, it's the fact that there's too much of it. Too many sub-plots are thrown into it, so much in fact that it starts feeling like a mash-up of a very bad meatball that nobody really wanted. While there are some bright points - especially through the mid-part, most of it is riddled with bad decision making on the part of the writer, and a terrible focus on the story overall. It jumps from one event to another in a matter of minutes, without proper pace or explanation, and things that supposedly mattered are soon thrown into sidelines to appear maybe 5 episodes later as a reminder to the audience that they exist. This is extremely apparent in the later parts of the anime, where the \"main antagonist\" (I'm playing heavily with the word \"main\" here) appears. It comes literally out of nowhere - with 0 foreshadowing, 0 reason or logic, and it thrusts you into a story that no one could have expected even if they tried. From what I've heard, the ending deviates from that of manga, but that's besides the point really. The jumps all over the story, with plots that, either standalone or as the part of the wholesome setting, make no sense and are quite terrible, it's really just a mess. Why 4 then? As I said beforehand, there are SOME bright spots. Yato's past is quite intriguing, yet we get to see little to none of it, as well as some parts with Yuki (although it's mostly bad). Other than that, there really isn't much to tell about the overall story. Just a bad mess. \\n\\n\r\nOn the production side, though, it feels like a completely different spectrum. Art is beautiful - it's colorful, it's crisp, animations are, for the most part, fluid and fights are animated well. Character designs, while not super-unique or anything, do bear their own charm. Even as a guy, you'll definitely think that Yuki is just terribly, unrealistically cute in a true sense of the word, while the main girl, Hiyori, is just run-of-the-mill average girl. What I really did like is the way they did eyes, especially Yato's and, at some parts, Yuki's. I really wish more anime would take the same approach.\\n\r\nOn the sound department, there really isn't much to complain about. Opening and ending are slightly above average, but you'll most-likely skip them after a few viewings. One song kind of sticks out above the rest - but it's mostly because it's used for each and every fight. Regardless, it's actually pretty good so I didn't mind it as much as I thought I would. Voice acting, while not phenomenal, really delivers. While side characters do stumble occasionally, the main trio (those who occupy the screen for the most part) are acted well enough, some even above average. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really saved this show, at least for me, are the characters. Are they unique? Uhm ... kind of? But that fact doesn't really stop them from being extremely enjoyable and interesting to watch. If not for some especially annoying moments, presented mostly by Yuki and Hiyori, I would have gladly given 10 in this department. Still, the drawbacks of those two characters are somewhat understandable once you grasp who they are, their age, and how they've been thrown into this random world full of surprises. \\n\\n\r\nI'll start with Yato - to be honest, I was really close to just flat-out adding him to my favorite characters collection. From his random moments, quirky jokes, attempts at being serious as well as being serious, to some of the flashbacks and information we get about him - they make one amazing character. He's rarely (if at all) annoying, and extremely likable. One flaw, possibly, is that he sometimes gets overzealous and that we seriously lack information about who the hell is this guy. By the end of the season, you'll know some bits and pieces about his past, but beyond that - nothing. When was he born? How old is he? How was he born? How does he know all these other gods? That's quite possibly his biggest drawback as the character. (note that I'm not taking into account the announced 2nd season; even with it, the lack of info about him is just way too big of a problem).\\n\\n\r\nI'll put Hiyori and Yuki together because they're quite similar. They're both around the same age and, while they do face different dilemmas, their characters do flow well together. Yuki is a teenager full of angst, envy and resentment and, while it is understandable, the show kind of beats you over the head with it far too many times for my liking. His age, at times, does not excuse his actions, but, after a certain episode, he'll really grown onto you. Hiyori, on the other hand, deals with this world a little bit better. I really think that her character is the weakest of the main trio - all we know about her really is that she likes wrestling, that she's somewhat rich, that she likes taking care of Yuki and one more thing I don't really want to spoil. She feels like somewhat of a generic human character in these types of stories - as somewhat of a \"moral plug\" for our main character so he doesn't go astray. While not as annoying as most of the characters that fall into that category, she really does like some decent development. \\n\\n\r\nAs for other characters, we meet them far too little to know anything more than basic info about them. Another drawback of this anime is that very fact - the lack of characters. Not really characters, but more the lack of gods. Throughout the show we meet less than dozen of gods although it's mentioned that there are a lot of them out there. Those few that we introduce feel mostly generic and not too fleshed out (two of them are basically just comic relief and a plot device). I do hope second season fixes this. \\n\\n\r\nThat really about sums it up. For better or worse, I enjoyed Noragami. The lack of any decent story was filled up with great production and good characters. The comedy is funny, action is great, and pace is kind of decent, I guess. The show would have gotten a whole lot of a worse score if I'm not accounting characters for the majority of my score in my reviews. For others, who don't really value good characters as highly as me, this will probably waver around 6 or so. The lack of good focus and storytelling really draws this anime back from potentially being a good gem. Irregardless, I felt that the time spent with this show was a good waste. But waste nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend it? Surely. It should be a good view if you're looking for something not too serious and quick, to get you in-between the weeks of waiting for your favorite show's next episode. \\n\\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated.",

The story is very well put together for being as short as it is. the only thing that bugs me is that a portion of the two enemies that they have to do battle with, doesn't even appear until the last two episodes. \r\nArt wasn't anything special but the reason I rated it so high wasbecause of Yato's eyes. they are so pretty.............!\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound track was so different but if fit really well. the music was strange at times but I kinda liked it! the characters for both the sub and dub versions are spot on!\\n\\n\r\nThe character did require some back story but the way the story unfolds, each character is given enough information for you to continue on with the story. A lot of characters were not given much back ground but it still makes sense, so im not going to complain.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime and it doesn't take to long to finish, so  I say that you should give it a shot!

            "content": "As a huge fan of the supernatural genre, especially anything to do with kami-sama (gods) and youkai, Noragami was definitely in my list for anime of 2014. And I am so glad it was! My only complaint is the length of the anime (too short!) which obviously means I loved it.\r\nStory: The story grabbed me within the first 1 minute of the show, as I could see that there's gonna be action (which I love), supernatural stuff (also my fave) and comedy (always good to have some). The story revolves around Yato, an obscure god trying to make a name for himself; Hiyori, a normalgirl who ends up being not very normal and becoming a half Phantom; and Yukine, a young boy who is a spirit and ends up being Yato's weapon. The story is quite fast paced, with never a dull moment, but takes it time when necessary (especially when important scenes are happening). There's a lot going on in the background, and you can tell there's more to the story than what is obvious, and that just keeps reeling you in to find out more, especially about Yato's past. But unfortunately due to the length of the anime, not everything is revealed yet, and a sense of unfulfillment settles in, which is why I gave the series 8 instead of 9 overall (here's to hoping for a second season!)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Clean dynamic art, with very intense colours (I absolutely adore Yato's eyes!) typical of Bones studio style. Reminded me off Ao no Exorcist and Zetsuen no Tempest's art style. I think other reviewers mentioned it too, about the scenes where Yato slices up the Phantoms and how it's such a cool scene with great artwork but keeps getting repeated (yes,I agree some variations would be nice). But other than that, the artwork is awesome, especially battle scenes! Character design was also really good, I felt that the characters matched their appearances quite well, and nothing was too overdone (something I have a bit of a bias against)\\n\\n\r\nSound: Loved the rock style opening, and the OST during the battle scenes especially were fantastic and set the mood really well. The ending song was also quite good, setting a more gentle tone. But the most wonderful thing about sound was definitely the amazing cast of seiyuus! The voice actors were amazing, with Yato being voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi, who I absolutely adore! How he manages to juggle the different sides of Yato is superb, and Kaji Yuki as Yukine was also fantastic! He's always had a penchant for voicing young troubled boys, and this time he did a great job yet again. Fukuyama Jun is also one of my favourite seiyuus, and despite being a supporting character, he made quite an impression as Kazuma too. Overall, the voice cast is just superb!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is also where Noragami shines for me. The happy-go-lucky guy with a dark past has always been my weakness, and Yato is exactly that. He comes across as idiotic and funny, but has a dark past; he acts like he doesn't care, yet does so much for the people he cares about. Yukine is a typical boy in puberty, filled with his share of problems that we all go through at that age, with his case being much worse because he's already dead.But he manages to over come his issues, and shows the greatest change among all three main characters. Hiyori is a favourite of mine, being such a difference from the typical girl, instead pulling out a martial art/wrestling move in her first appearance, and always reacting in a way that I didn't see coming.  But Noragami manages to make every character shine, with even supporting characters being fleshed out and developed really well, so you felt like you could relate to all of them.The supporting characters are the key players that make this anime shine, and I enjoy seeing their interaction with the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Noragami is a great anime, with colourful characters, a fast paced storyline, and a good balance of action,comedy and drama. Really hoping for a second season!\\n",

Characters are well drawn and the background is decent. Sadly if I didn't raise an eyebrow to the synopsis from what I had seen on the first episode I probably would of dropped this one as like I said it has a slow starting point. But I stuck it out only because I expected to see this anime grow, and I was right. With this anime being a bit of a late bloomer inunderstanding who the characters really are and where the plot was going to lead me. I'm glad I stuck it out. About half way through the anime the beat finally picks up. And some more devious and under lying plots finally arise that make this anime start too sing as being worth seeing. I know now that my original feelings behind this one were wrong and in fact would rather enjoy a second season. \\n\r\nTo sum this one up. If you are looking for an out of the box action anime this one probably wont do it for you. But if you stick it out you'll probably still enjoy it.

            "content": "THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE PAST THE FIRST EPISODE!\r\nToo lazy to read the whole Review? Read the Character and Story sections! Or if even more lazy, the TL;DR section!\r\nNoragami's Setting:\r\nWhat is Noragami? Noragami is a world in which Gods fight creatures called Phantoms (basically creatures that feed off of sin.) Although they are Gods, they do not necessarily all get along with each other. (Like not how all humans get along with each other.) These Gods use weapons to defeat these Phantoms called Regalia. Regalia are spirits who were once Humans who have died with a will to continue living. This is why these previoushumans are now Regalia. For a mere 12 episode show, Noragami has an incredibly in depth story and setting. They did an incredible job of developing the characters, story, and the universe in a time frame of which most shows cannot do given 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nStory overall 9:\\n\r\n Everyone has their own tastes and preferences, Noragami is likely to appeal to people interested in Fantasy, Shounen, Comedy, and people who like a hint of romance in their shows. The story was well developed. Through little nuances and certain actions performed by the characters, you get a thorough understanding of the universe in which they live. There are a few cliff hangers in the story which a possible season 2 can easily fill. However, these cliff hangers are by no means a deal breaker for this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7\\n\r\nOkay, a 7, that is pretty low. But why is it a 7? While I really enjoyed the art, (I would score that a 9) the animation was good, but nothing special. The animators were great at choosing key frames during fight scenes. The animation is typical fast paced fighting. Because the animation isn't extremely fluid compared to other shows of similar genre, I give the animation a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe opening theme and ending theme are both very good. They use multiple songs for different fights, different songs for different moments. It is not the same song over and over. That would be tiring. Most importantly, they used a variety of sound tracks that helps inspire the mood they want you to feel. Quite well, I might add. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis, is one place I believe this show really shines. A show of this genre to develop the characters with such depth in a mere 12 episodes is nothing short of astonishing. The characters are entertaining, and play off of each other really well. Many shows have characters that are boring by themselves, and are only good because of how they play off of each other, but Noragami is not like that. Noragami's characters play well off each other, and are independently, really entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nBy far the most important aspect of an anime. The characters mixed with the incredible story make this show incredibly enjoyable to watch. There is never a dull moment in this show! I found myself watching all of the opening and ending themes resisting the incredible urge to skip straight to the next episode!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR 9:\\n\r\nBecause of the incredible depth of the characters and story, this show is a must watch for anyone who is interested in these genres!\\n\\n",

This is the only anime out of 148 animes that I have watched including Ano Hana that has every made me cry. \r\nIt is an unique well thought through anime. It has quite unique characters with really good character development however still missing a few mysteries that they did not solve at the end. Also making the ending slightly disappointing. Despite this, everything that had happened in the anime made up for it completely. \r\nThe characters had voice actors that fit them, great music especially when Yato casts the 'spell'. \r\nIt is incredibly impressive despite the short 12episodes.  I think it needs a second season. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend it very much if you like anime that I like (take a look at my profile ;)) \\n",

            "content": "K-konichiwa everyone. I want to start off my fourth review with saying thank you all so much for liking my last three reviews and for everyone that commented. I enjoyed everyone's criticism and without all of your support and brutally honest opinions I wouldn't be  writing reviews like this. \r\nA-arigatou Gozaimasu! *bows* \ud83d\ude02\r\nNoragami is about a young man named Yato. Yato is a minor god who wears a jersey, who's extremely playful and sneaky (like a cat), and most importantly, he doesn't even own a single shrine. In order to fulfil his dream of having a shrine and becoming recognized as an actual god,he always draws his cell phone number in every nook and cranny, telling people that he will grant whatever wish they desire for a charge of 5-yen. In other words, he is delivering god. Hiyori, a normal high school student and daughter of a wealthy family, is almost killed in a traffic accident, but, she is rescued by Yato. This causes her to become a  half-human, half-phantom who can always leave her physical body in phantom form. She hunts Yato down, and they begin to work together in order to help Yato be recognized as a god. On their adventure, Yato finds a boy named Yukine, who becomes his regalia that can be used by a god as a weapon. The three young teens, fight phantoms and other gods who harm humans as Yato's dangerous, yet sexy (yes,  I added sexy)  past is revealed. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nI love this anime's plot. It sort of has an Ancient Greek, Japanese god feeling to it, which I love! I gave this anime an 8 because unlike any of the anime I have watched, it has made sure to have comedy into all of its seriousness and action and mystery, with a tiny bit of  possible love interest and sexiness from Yato. \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has allowed me to have another anime boyfriend (everyone should already know who that person is \ud83d\udc99). It has given me a dose of what life is really made of from a god's point of view.\\n\\n\r\nArt and design (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nWas the art of this anime sexy as hell? YES. Honestly, what turned me on about the art and design of this anime was Yato's beautiful and sexy blue eyes. I'm sorry if I'm being a bit fangirlish about Yato but he is so amazing that it's not even funny. Why does this anime get a partially high score in art and design???? Yato, of course, but honestly and seriously, I love the battle scenes and the slaying of phantoms and their after affects. It won my affection!!!!  \ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\\n\\n\r\nSound Effects (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's voice actors did an amazing job with these characters! I hope that this anime comes up with a live action! \ud83d\ude3b\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\\n\r\n*blushes* I-i fell in love with Yato-kun....\\n\\n\r\nHis sneakiness and his sexiness during different situations and his reactions to everything comical is amazing! Yato-kun's emotions are perfectly compatible to my own, which is shy and a tiny bit evil. He is my new anime boyfriend! (w-well....#3 of course...) \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udc99\\n\\n\r\nOverall Experience:\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to anyone who is interested in Ancient god history and comedy. If not,  then I still recommend you watching it because it is really amazing!  \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\\n\\n",

However, only a few have made that list, and I am glad to say that Noragami is one of them.\r\nStory: A fun filled comedic story with good serious elements added at the right points. Not to mention that the fillers in this actually enhance the viewing experience.\r\nArt: Probably the best art I have ever seen. Nostalgic, yet tone shifting to adapt to the mood of the scene. I could say that without a doubt, Studio Bones has a real good chance at remaking the animeindustry.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: Everything in there is just cool. Uber cool. Haven't heard such good OP or Yato soundtrack after all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Just watch the anime. I cannot emphasize how much of a good character arc is taken by this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: To the max. The fighting sequences and the funny moments are just so awesome.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, since this anime has introduced me to my one true god, I feel that this is a good anime to begin your journey as a Yatoite. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone can watch this anime. It fits everyone's tastes right away!",

            "content": "The anime I was excited for the 2014 winter lineup were Buddy Complex, which turned out a disappointment, and Bones\u2019 Noragami, an adaption of the manga with the same name. Bones can make some pretty stellar anime series. From Soul Eater to Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, they have a nice resume of making anime. Noragami is no exception.\r\nNoragami takes place in modern day Japan. The story follows a minor god named Yato, who wants to be the most worshipped god in the world, but he is homeless and poor. Adding insult to injury, his shinki, an item forged from the spirit of a dead human,left him. A shinki can also take form as a human or a weapon. A good analogy is a demon weapon from Soul Eater. After the shinki leaves Yato, he takes a job to find a cat so he can build his shrine.  he is looking for the cat, he almost gets run over by a bus. However, Hiyori Iki, a high school girl pushes him out of the speeding bus.  Hiyori gets hit by the bus, which somehow disconnects her soul to disconnect from her body. After this incident, she realizes she keeps on leaving her body unwillingly and able to see dead spirits. She asks Yato to help her out, and with his new shinki Yukine, they try to solve Hiyori\u2019s problem. The story gets much more complicated then this, and I love every single storyline. \\n\\n\r\nNoragami deals a lot with the corruption of humans. Suicide is a major theme in the early episodes and the development of Yuki as a new shinki is a compelling storyline. My only gripe of the story is that the middle of the ending arc is terribly battle-heavy, losing the story aspect and the charm it had, though the ending is fantastic. Other than the middle of the ending arc, the story will engross your mind and you\u2019ll want to watch the next episode as the previous one ends.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami\u2019s art is marvelous. Every establishing shot looks visually stunning. It sucks you in the environment and is one of the best artistic settings I have seen in an anime in recent time. I griped about the battle scenes dragging out the story, but the battle scenes look amazing as well. The characters are also designed well, but sometimes they look off a bit. The art is flawless and impeccable, and the best part of the anime in my personal opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Noragami are definitely some of my favorite. All of the characters are likable, even side characters are memorable. The 3 main characters, Yato, Hiyori, and Yukine, play off each other wonderfully. These characters are all three-dimensional. I like to think of them as a family sometimes, since they function like one. Yato is the father figure of the leading characters. He is egotistical, focusing on himself becoming a more popular god. Later on in the series though, he starts to care more about Hiyori and Yukine, protecting them from dangers. When the series draws to a close, his character changes from narcissistic to caring. Hiyori is the motherly figure of the leading characters. She doesn\u2019t develop her characters a lot, but she more or less portrays the audience\u2019s reactions. She is kind and courteous. She is fond of Yato and protective of Yukine. She helps the both of them change into better people. Yukine is the most controversial out of the three main characters. Many people don\u2019t like him, since he plays off innocent when he does terrible things. Despite that, I like his character a lot. I don\u2019t see him as a manipulative person, but as a lost person, trying to find himself. People might call him greedy, but he never lived a full life, and wants to. He also changes to be less greedy, which makes me like him even more. The characters are crafted carefully and wonderfully, which creates some of my favorite characters in any anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Noragami is good, however, not as stellar as the whole anime. The voice acting Noragami is solid, I didn\u2019t find anyone annoying and remember all of the voices ringing in my head. The opening, Overnight Appointment performed by Hello Sleepwalkers, and the ending, Heart Realize performed by Tia, are fantastic works. Overnight Appointment has an adrenaline rush that pumps you up for the episode, and Heart Realize is a nice medley that is mellow. The soundtrack has its hits and misses. I hate the techno styled songs during battles, but I love the traditional, orchestral songs. Overall, sound-wise it is not bad, not outstanding like the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot stress this enough, but Noragami is out of this world. The story is wonderful, the art is gorgeous, and the characters, though having a god status, are relatable. The sound is not bad as well. Overall, I recommend this anime to everyone and give Noragami a nine out of ten.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

In my rating system, I count my score for characters for 35% of the total, story as 30% of the total, art as 20%, and 15% for the sound. \r\nI give Noragami a 7.15 and I'll tell you why.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story in itself was very unique and creative. Noragami brings you into a world where Gods have their own personalities and are assisted by spirits, aka Divine Instruments, in accomplishing the wishes of those who ask for their help. The idea is pretty creative and well done. \r\nCharacters: 7\r\nThe characters were well thought out and had decent personalities. I didn't find toomany characters stereotypical but I also wasn't shocked by the characters' personalities. There was really only character development of one character throughout the entire season and the rest of the cast seemed to stay the same. \\n\\n\r\nHaving a dark and mysterious past is definitely a good hook but I didn't really feel the intensity behind some situations that I get the feeling were supposed to make you shake from anticipation or cry. There was some good repartee between the characters but if they keep the relationships of the characters the same into season 2 it will get very boring very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nothing special. At times, like when an ayakashi is destroyed, the animation is creative, but after the first few times, it can get repetitive. Unlike Bakemonogatari, whose animation blew my mind every episode, I really wanted to love this art, but I feel like it let me down. Not bad, but not great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe truth is I didn't notice the music in this anime. Some might say that is good, but not only did I not take notice of it, I can't recall a single scene in which it really gave me perspective on what I was watching. The voice acting, specifically of Hiyori, was quite good, which is why I'll give sound a 6.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.15\\n\\n\r\nI'm amazed that this anime was able to combine comedy and romance into this fantasy setting and still make a coherent and entertaining story. Unfortunately, even with the original story, this anime is not very memorable and did not make me feel very strongly one way or the other, so that's why it gets a 7.15. I'm looking forward to season 2 but not expecting too much from it.",

            "content": "I instantly watched it when I heard the popular voice actor Kamiya Hiroshi is the main character. When the series ended I was a little bit disappointed how there was only 12 episodes. \r\nStory: Is about a god named Yato, a legendary mass killer god then changes later on to be a positive god. He wants to build a shrine and be worship by people. He then meets a girl named Hiyori, he made a promise to her that he will return her back into a human when she became half phantom and half human. Then he fights bunch of conflicts that explains humans fallinginto despair and ended up to suicide. He fights these \"Phantoms\" that drives humans into madness with a weapon that is called a \"Shinki\" I believe, the exact opposite of phantoms, Shinki are spirits that wants to live and regrets their decisions, they come into weapon physical form if it's chosen by a god. Yato has some conflicts with his Shinki and then keeps all the pain he gets from his weapon. The anime has some conflicts, the story didn't even finish and it wasn't anticipating as others. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I give sound a 10/10 rating because like any other anime they sync there soundtrack on to the anime. It definitely has the \"japanese war good\" and \"traditional\" theme. Which I enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: What makes this anime quite decent is the characters, there is a lot of characters that is hiding a lot of pain and there back stories are upsetting and can make you feel a \"lucky\" person as you are now. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The action scenes were good, excellent swordsmanship/way of the samurai. I enjoyed it but not as I enjoy it a lot, there are a lot of scenes where a character falls into despair and makes foolish and stupid scenes, you can't blame them because they are \"human\". But then you have too because we're human too, I face-palm my ass off watching this anime. But then there will be pretty deep quotes and actions that awes me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Noragami is like SAO, very over rated, I believe it deserves a lower rank around 500-1000, well that is just my opinion.",

I had been waiting for this anime in anticipation, and it didn\u2019t disappoint me in the least. \r\nStory \u2013 9/10  The story, about a human girl - Iki Hiyori - meeting a god \r\n- Yato - and getting into trouble (which she solves of course) , was detailed and maybe not entirely unique but still refreshing, it's not your usual story about gods. Though the story is light hearted it has a somewhat dark side and that makes the anime even more intriguing. I\u2019m also following the manga so Iknow Bones could have taken the story further so it\u2019s a pity the anime is only 13 episodes long. I also think the end is a bit disappointing but it\u2019s satisfying and doesn\u2019t leave the watchers hanging.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 8/10 I loved the art and the colors, they truly made the world and the characters come to life but it wasn\u2019t really unique. One thing about the art I absolutely loved were the main characters\u2019 eyes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9/10 The characters too were wonderful and each had a well-worked out personality and background.  It\u2019s incredible to see how Iki Hiyori (the protagonist) manages to help the people (mainly gods) she meets help through an identity change. The voice actors too were chosen well and certainly added charm to their characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs conclusion I\u2019d say, it was a wonderful anime, a little too short but worthy of a high score. I certainly recommend both the anime and the manga and hope that you will enjoy the series as much as I did.\\n",

            "content": "For every 100 animes out there (stats pulled out of my ass) that contains ecchi, harem and lolis, there will be that 1 anime that contains none of those. Noragami is that 1 anime. I mean, when was the last time you had seen an anime where there's more male main characters than female main characters?\r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (8/10)\r\nYato is a minor deity who lacks even a single shrine. In order to build his own shrine and fain recognition as a god, he scrawls his cell number on the wall on the streets of downtown telling people he will help themin exchange for a 5 yen offering, becoming a self-styled \"delivery god\". Hiyori, the daughter of a respectable family, saves Yato from being killed by a bus. This caused her to become a \"hanyou\". Yato also finds a boy named Yukine who becomes his \"Regalia. Yato, along with Hiyori and Yukine battle phantoms who bring harm to humans as Yato's dark hidden history is gradually revealed.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't know what to expect when I started watching this show. I didn't read the synopsis nor did I do any research on this anime at all. So I had no idea about the main character being a god and et cetera, et cetera. I also had no idea that the show was going to be this freaking hilarious..I mean, there's no \"Comedy\" stamped on the show's tag. I'll get to Noragami's comedy later in my review but for now, I want to focus first on the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is divided into two arcs. The first arc focuses on Yukine and this arc is more of a character-driven story..It's mostly Yukine's character development, his struggles, and etc. that drives this arc. I'll talk more about what happened in Yukine's arc at the \"Characters\" category. The second arc focuses on Yato and this arc, like the first one, is also a character-driven story. This arc focuses on Yato's past and that past hunting him back to this day. I'll talk more about what happened in Yato's arc at the \"Characters\" category. \\n\\n\r\nThe first 4-5 episodes are one of the funniest episodes I have seen in a while and I haven't laughed this hard ever since watching the \"Haruhi Suzumiya\" anime show. Story introductions, character introductions and expositions are usually boring as f*ck so what the show did here is spice it up by adding a ton of funny moments. 95% of the time, Yato and his interactions with other characters are what makes the show extremely funny. For example, the faces that he makes, offering his service for only \"5 yen\" (which is about 4 cents USD), advertising on the wall of the bathroom stalls, the \"Falling down from the building\" scene, Yato and Hiyori arguing/Yato and Yukine arguing and the list goes on. 5% of the time, the characters make fun of Yato being a lazy bum god who doesn't even have his own shrine. Thanks for the laughs \"Noragami\", I needed it after having just watched a depressing anime. If you did not laugh at the first 4-5 episodes of Noragami then I recommend that you go get checked because living a life with a crappy sense of humour is bad for your health.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami knows when to use the jokes and when not to use jokes. When the show gets all dark and serious then they will not use the jokes...for the most part, at least. There were some serious scenes where they inserted a joke or 2 but it's only a minor issue. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the show has tons of great moments, the show also has flaws and there are at least......2 of them...I think. I'm kidding, I only found one flaw and it's the show's pacing. The show's pacing went a bit fast in the second half of the show. This could have been easily solved if the show had 16-19 episodes but unfortunately, most animes today suffer of only having 12/13 episodes which is clearly not enough and Noragami is no exception.     \\n\\n\r\nLast thing that I want to point which might disappoint some manga fans is the anime original route in episode 10-12. In other words, Yato's arc is a filler. Now that you know  Yato's arc is a filler, what you're probably wondering right now is...Is Yato's arc a good filler or a bad filler that deserves to be skipped? Having only watched the anime version, I'm going to have to say that Noragami is one of those animes which contains a good filler arc. I mean, the arc is not better than Yukine's arc but the arc is watchable and it also developed Yato's character.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)   \\n\r\nI have only watched few of Bone's (name of the studio who created Noragami) anime so I don't really know the studio's animation style. What I do know is that Bone's did an amazing job in animating Noragami. The visuals looks great, the character designs are well down, and the fighting scenes are fairly smooth but with some few choppiness. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nNoragami did a great job on the soundtrack department. The themes that they used in the battle scenes are well done. There was 1 battle theme that I heard which sounded like an Indian Ritual song..Even the singer sounds Indian. The soundtrack used for the \"slice-of-life-ish\" scene are pretty decent and they indicate whether a hilarious moment will come or not. Now the OP and ED theme song. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Goya no Machiawase\" by Hello Sleepwalkers and the ED theme song is \"Heart Realize\" by Tia. I really don't get why some people are saying that Noragami has one of the best OP theme song. I mean, it sounds good but in my opinion, it's not the greatest OP theme song out there. The ED theme song, on the hand, is a lot better than the OP theme song. I just love supercell's songs. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English VA's. In my opinion, FUNimation did a great job with the cast and the voice actor themselves did a great job voicing the characters. None of them sound monotonic and you can hear the emotions on their voices when one of the drama moment comes up. This is most noticeable in Hiyori's English VA. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9.5/10) (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nLike I promised, I'm going to talk about Yukine and Yato's arc first before the rest of the characters. Yukine's arc is one of the most memorable arc in Noragami. \\n\\n\r\nIn this arc, Yukine became jealous once he saw the students in a school having fun, fooling around, talking to other students....you know, typical teenager stuff. They also have a family and a future that they can look forward too, something Yukine doesn't really have. This caused Yukine to have a mental breakdown (or something similar to that) and you know what happens if Yukine has a mental breakdown. Yato also suffers...physically. The moral lesson of this arc is you need to accept that you're dead and move on. Like Yukine says, it isn't fair that they're having fun and he's not. Life isn't fair bud. Any one of us could be dead by tomorrow. I'm probably going to face the same thing as Yukine when I die because I'm only 17 and I haven't experienced the adulthood yet but sooner and later, I'm going to have to accept the fact that I'm dead and move on. The lesson of this arc and how Yukine accepted it is the whole reason why I love this arc. \\n\\n\r\nYato's arc is different. Yato has a dark past that continually tries to haunt him even to this day. He's obviously changed and has moved on. One of the gods doesn't want him to change and wants him to stay the way he was over a hundred years ago. Look, the moral story of this arc is everyone changes over the years. A person cannot stay exactly the same. A person you knew 50-100 years ago might not be the same person 50-100 years later. Especially when that person has a dark past..In this case, Yato. \\n\\n\r\nLast Main character that I want to talk about is Hiyori. Hiyori, who got hit by a bus in order to save Yato, is now a \"hanyou\". She now suffers from a problem where her spirit randomly leaves her original body. Thus, she payed Yato 5 yen in order to fix her problem *wink wink* For the most part....he can't. I'm going to make this short..I like her character. She's a strong independent female character who doesn't suck on the MC's dick nor does she ever need Yato's help. She's also one of the few female character in the anime industry who isn't overly-sexualized (i.e she doesn't have big boobs, she's not a loli, etc.). Thank.f*cking.Lord\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nMy expectations weren't that high when I first watched the show so I completely enjoyed the anime from start to finish. This is also one of the few animes that I marathoned which is very rare considering that I'm busy at school and work. Everytime I get a free-time or lunch break, I immediately turned this show on. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Noragami\" is one of the most amazing anime that I have ever watched. It contains a great character-driven story arcs, characters that are relatable and are also developed, great side-characters, great comedy and only contains few fanservice scenes that aren't really distracting. If you're looking for a dark and serious anime with a slice of funny moments then this is the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great Character-Driven stories\\n\r\n+Great Visuals and Animations\\n\r\n+Awesome Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Characters are great, relatable and are also developed\\n\r\n+First half of the show is extremely funny\\n\r\n+Dark and serious tone on the second half\\n\r\n+Fanservice scenes are not distracting\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Pacing Issues on the second half\\n\r\n-Anime Original Route might disappoint some manga fans",

A sense that a human can communicate and become friends with gods. It tells a tale of friendship mixed in with a dash of supernatural elements. \r\nIn the story, Yato, Yukine and Hiyori make a wonderful trio. They never fail to amuse the audience, make themscream in frustration, make them cry. The way they present themselves is something that most of us can relate to. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, this was a great anime. Rating: 9/10.",

The anime is not stretched out at any point in time; each episode brings the same quality with it.\r\nThe idea of spirits lurking in the shadows, tempting humanity to do evil, and consuming those that give in to temptation, is easy to relate to and brings a valuable message across, namely that everyone has a battle in life that has to be dealt with.\r\nHiyori is what makes this anime extraordinary. The artwork of her character isexquisite and her two lives, one as a human, one as a spirit, bring forth many funny scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real downside is the out of place animation of Yato's signature combat move.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to everyone, including grown ups, especially if you are looking for something entertaining without constant combat.",

Guess i'm gonna go and collect those precious 5 yen and start wishing lol\r\nStory:8\r\nA story about a forgotten god , Yato who is a god that's only want 5 yen for every wish thathe granted . He is also known as the God of Calamity by other gods . When he was searching for a lost cat , he met Iki Hiyori who actually can see Yato despite other people can't see him . There , his journey as the 5 yen god begins . The story plot was actually quite good . I really like the idea of a forgotten god . Noragami is also an anime where it teaches us about life which is very ironic for me .\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nThe arts and animation here were nice . Some able to capture my interest with it's beautiful animations and some didn't . It's an anime where you can or can't fall for it's beautiful arts .\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nThe voice actor and actress did a good job at voice acting . I really like the voice actress for Kofuku Ebisu , who is voiced by Toyosaki Aki . The OP and ED were great . With it's thrill  effects on OP , it just make me pump up to watch the episode . The ED have this relax effect when i hear it .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8\\n\r\nThe character plot were good actually . Some does have a bit of background and a character development and some didn't . We have other gods beside Yato , who is either know as the delivery god or the Calamity god , Bishamon , the combat god who has a problem with Yato due to Yato killing her Shinki , Kofuku Ebisu , who is the poverty god and so on . Beside gods , we have a non-god characters like Iki Hiyori , who is the heroine of this series , Yukine , who is a shinki that Yato is using , Kazuma , who is the handsome prince that is also a shinki for Bishamon and others . There are so many characters here that some didn't last long . Beside some characters that didn't have much development and a background , there are really no other flaws for the character plot .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\nThe enjoyment that i get from watching Noragami is a new experience for me . Noragami taught me a very good lesson about life like killing one self to escape one pains isn't the best way . That path is only for those who are weak minded or just want an easy way to escape painful life really . The comedy is funny as hell . There are a bit of drama at some episodes but it didn't make me cry or anything .\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nI really enjoy watching Noragami . With it's way of showing us that life doesn't have a price because it is priceless to begin with , it just make me wanting more . Looks like my wish is granted because season two is coming up . Since my wish was almost granted , i will give Yato a 5 yen lol . Anyway , if you want an anime where it doesn't have too much episodes , an anime where gods are related , this one is for you .",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nWhat if evil or bad thoughts, such as the desire to end your own life, didn't come from your own consciousness? What if there was someone working behind the scenes possessing you and prompting you to even have such thoughts? And what if there were others destroying these defilements and, in the process, eliminating such thoughts from your mind? While these questions would seem strange in ordinary conversation, they are explored in \"Noragami\", a fun but flawed bangsian fantasy influenced by such works as \"Bleach\", \"Soul Eater\" and even \"Inuyasha\" to a degree.\r\nStory & World (7/10):\r\n\"Noragami\" is largely set in between the afterlife and theworld of the living (or the Far Shore and Near Shore as they are referred), where Phantoms latch on to the depression of people and make them do all sorts of bad things, the most prominent being committing suicide. Thankfully, there are gods (yes, gods) who work to destroy these creatures and eliminate such thoughts from their minds. One such god is Yato, the 'stray god' of the title, who, as the name implies, is a minor god with not even one shrine dedicated to him. His lifelong dream is to build his own shrine and become a god that everyone bows down to. To accomplish this, he works as a delivery god, taking whatever job people give him for 5 yen. One day, an ordinary school girl called Hiyori Iki encounters this outsider after saving him from being hit by a car. However, she gets hit as a result, and wakes up in her family's hospital discovering who Yato is. Furthermore, she finds out that she has become a half-Phantom and stuck between the Near Shore and the Far Shore. Horrified by this change, she pays Yato to fix her condition.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, despite being a god, Yato can't do very much by himself. To tackle large jobs, he needs a Regalia, the spirit of a human moulded into a weapon. Thankfully, Yato soon finds one in the form of Yukine, a teenage boy. Together, the three of them take on jobs and soon Hiyori and Yukine realise there's a lot more to Yato than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason for the story's not-so-glowing score is that it's little more than an introduction. Ultimately, we have this fantastic concept and the show does very little with it, with the bulk of the story being Yukine learning to cope with his new life with Yato and them (along with Hiyori) gradually forming a bond. Thankfully, the last three episodes rectifies this somewhat by having a great battle between Yato and a figure from his past, complimented by a touching ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (8.5/10):\\n\r\n\"Noragami\" is very well-animated, but it feels kind of lacking considering it only came out a couple of years ago. It seems to rely a lot on wacky facial animations just to get comedy across, when what's happening on screen is funny by itself. What looks really good, however, is the Phantoms. Yato says in the second episode that they come in all shapes in sizes and he is absolutely right. There are many that take the forms of various animals including frogs, butterflies and even scorpions. Besides the variety, their design is amazing, having a distinct CGI look to them.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (9/10):\\n\r\n\"Noragami\"'s soundtrack is really good, having some really great themes, the most notable being the opening, \"Noratan\" and \"Misogi\". This also happens to be the first anime I watched start to finish in dubbed and subbed and I would say I liked both about the same. They both have their own strengths and advantages over each other. Bryn Apprill, for example, does a better job at voicing Hiyori than Maaya Uchida, while Hiroshi Kamiya makes for a better Yato than Jason Liebrecht. Yuki Kaji and Micah Solusod, on the other hand, deliver equally good performances as Yukine, giving two distinct voices that both fit him really well. Besides them, each version contains a strong supporting cast including Alexis Tipton, Eric Vale, Miyuki Sawashiro and Daisuke Ono. \"Noragami\" also has more than its fair share of good dialogue, both awesome and hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\r\nThe characters are brilliant, having more than one dimension and believable personalities. As I said before, there is a lot more to Yato than he appears. Despite coming across as lazy, selfish, greedy and an outright pervert most of the time, deep down inside his soul lies a very tragic, remorseful figure. As a god of war born from a wish, he killed many people in his past and eventually became sick of it and now desires to leave that past behind. He also has no sympathy for those who choose to commit suicide and while unsympathetic characters are universally hated, (due to being nasty and spiteful towards people who have usually suffered enough for the audience to feel sorry for them) Yato avoids this by having a good justification. Souls who commit suicide can't become Regalias. Therefore, every single Regalia (Yukine included) are people who lost their lives unwillingly. Yato despises seeing people waste lives that Regalias would love to live, believing that even if things are painful and tough, people should appreciate what it means to be alive at all, which, when you think about it, does make a lot of sense.\\n\\n\r\nHiyori is a great character as well. After the car accident, her soul frequently slips out of her body, turning her into a half-phantom. In this state, she gains a cat-like tail (which is actually the thing that connects her soul and body) as well as superhuman strength, speed and agility. Despite being raised to be lady-like by her mother, in private she is a huge fan of the martial artist Tono, and frequently copies his moves against Phantoms. While she can't outright destroy them, she can definitely hold her own and in fact saves Yato's life several times. She also has the kindness of a typical anime heroine, judging by the fact that she's established as risking her life to save a complete stranger. \\n\\n\r\nThe main arc puts a large focus on Yukine's development, as he learns to cope with being dead and how he can't do what the living can do anymore, as well as being thankful for what he does have instead of complaining about what he doesn't have. Then again, his early attitude is kind of justified as Yato initially sees him as a tool rather than a human being. It takes Hiyori to finally have the two come to terms with each other and she does so in more ways than one. The supporting cast is cool, but they're called the supporting cast for a reason, and so Hiyori, Yato and Yukine get by far the most screen time, with them only helping every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\\n\r\n\"Noragami\" may seem boring for some as not an awful lot happens overall. The anime is definitely fun to watch but if you're expecting anything massive to happen you will definitely be disappointed. That being said, it is very funny and will cause you to laugh out loud multiple times, if you're into comedy that is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDespite its obvious flaws, \"Noragami\" is great fun to watch with awesome music and interesting characters. It may not do very much with its concept, but what it does do is still good in its own right and makes this anime at least worth a look. For more on \"Noragami\", be sure to check out for my review for the second season, \"Noragami Aragoto\".\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n7+8.5+9+9+8=41.5/50=8.3/10",

            "content": "I just finished watching this anime's first season since it's second season, Aragoto, is getting much hype on the internet recently it seems. I found it very interesting how they used the idea of shrines and their gods and bring it to life in a world where these things aren't simply giving an offering for a wish to fall on deaf ears. In the world of Noragami, Each shrine has it's respective god and are able to answer the wishes/prayers of human beings. Though being a battle shounen anime, it's pace is not too slow and keeps you interested. I know this because when Ibinge watch and it gets a little dull or slow down, I don;t feel like watching the entire thing through. In this case, I watched all 12 episodes without a pause. I even at my lunch while watching.\\n\\n\r\nThis first season has set the groundwork for understanding how the world works in the series, and I've got to say I really like the concept and execution so far. Surely the second season has to be better especially with its hype.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many gods and shrines and history for each that have lived for a very long time. I look forward to learning more about the people in the anime. Character development should be interesting indeed! I love learning about the history of how something came to be as well. I'm looking forward to rating the second season higher than I did this first season.",

If there's one thing i don't believe in, it should be that i don't believe in overrated animes. If they are popular, there must be a reason to it. I'm not gonna ramble much about the storyline because it's in the synopsis. Long story short, Yato is a god who thrives to become famous, does many silly jobs just to be believed in and collects 5 yen in order to build his own shrine. Hiyori saves him from being hit and since then her soulalternately leaves and returns to her body without her permision. She asks Yato to help her. Yukine becomes Yato's \"weapon\" in order to fight their enemy, the Phantom. \\n\\n\r\nWhen i first started this series, i was not very hyped. But i was entertained. For me, it was not something that gives me the crave to watch this specific anime every morning i wake up. I felt like it was predictable. It was ok. After a few more episodes, i started to feel more interested because it took another turn from what i originally expected. It triggers my emotion little by little and i love that feeling. \\n\\n\r\nThe character themselves are entertaining to watch. Yato is that type of person or god who is funny and ridiculous but wise and serious at the same time. These characteristics of his are what make him likable in my opinion. Yukine is the special trigger here. His character development is what makes this show worth watching. As for Hiyori, she's just another typical school girl we see in any other animes. I did not expect much from her but that does not make her less interesting. \\n\\n\r\nI won't say that Noragami is not for those who have a weak heart because it is obviously not as heart wrenching as Anohana and Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, but that does not mean you will not be moved. I watched this anime because of all the hyped but i definitely stayed for the \"plot\" plot. \\n",

            "content": "7/10\r\nThe main character of Noragami is  a girl caught in a limbo between the afterlife and the physical world, a state that reflects the show itself. Noragami is an anime that is caught between true greatness and forgettability.\r\nThe setup is nothing you haven't seen before: through a few bizarre circumstances, a high school girl gets involved in the lives of an immortal demon hunter and his compatriots, and over time they learn to trust and understand each other, despite their own personal demons, and didn't we just watch Kyoukai no Kanata? The twist here is that these demon hunters are actually gods, and theirweapons forged from the souls of regretful spirits.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami's style is undeniable. Gods fight phantoms while leaping from skyscraper to skyscraper while their enemies roll their eyes eerily and speak in distorted, disjointed childlike muttering. Yato, Hiyori's accidental god-friend, is especially theatrical, finishing off his enemies with a flourish of his sword and a triumphant recitation: \"You who would desecrate this land of the rising sun, etc.\" is heard nearly every episode, sometimes multiple times in one.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the plot is where the show falters. The story is set up into roughly three arcs: an introductory arc where all the pieces and elements are put into place, a crisis arc where a big threat shows up and tears the team apart, and the \"boss\" arc where the team comes together for a final, earth-shaking clash. It is with the last two arcs that I take issue.\\n\\n\r\nBishamon, the antagonist in the second arc, has undeniable stage presence. She is a busty lady who rides a lion, wields a whip and a pair of pistols, and has a grudge against Yato. But I know nothing about her, or her past, because the show didn't have time to dwell on her. The same goes for Nora, the mysterious girl who obviously has a history with Yato and appears every so often to make mysterious pronouncements. Noragami accelerates the relationships between Hiyori, Yato and Yukine (the spirit of Yato's sword) to a blistering pace, at the cost of all else. The final conflict seems especially rushed, with very little setup and no explanation until it's all over.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationships between the three main characters is where this show shines. Yato is a prickly, vain layabout whose lifestyle choices fail to endear him to his companions quite as much as they do to his audience. Much of the show is spent with the trio at odds because of Yato's attitude, and while this would seem like a cheap attempt to create drama, it becomes integral to the plot during the second arc. It is not spoiling too much to say that gods and their weapons are affected by each others' thoughts, and that Yukine is a sullen adolescent, but I will say no more.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, what could have brought this show on par with similar \"urban fairy-tale\" anime like Durarara! or Kyoukai no Kanata would be a 24-episode runtime instead of a mere 12. More time could have fleshed out the supporting cast and generated a bit more intrigue without sacrificing the relationships at the core of the show. Given that the manga is still running, one wishes for a second season to realize Noragami's full potential. Unfortunately, I'm all out of 5-yen pieces.",

            "content": "Aww yeah. Noragami. Holy Yato. I don't want to make a big *ss text, so i'll just say what i think about it.\r\n     THIS... umm... PART OF THE REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS, BUT IT'S JUST THE STARTING OF THE STORY, SO WHATEVER\r\nStory 6/10 - Actually, the Story isn't THAT good. It's pretty simple. So here's the start, Yato is a stray god (that means Noragami, so that's the reason of the name) that realizes wishes dor 5 Yen. Iki Hiyori is a girl who gets atropelated to save Yato from a bus, because he was crossing the street and didn't see it.Then, Iki Hiyori kinda gets between the Near Shore, where we are (or at least big part of the people reading this review) and the Far Shore, where gods and spirits and everything from the spiritual world are. As i said, it's pretty simple.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 8/10 - Man, i did like the art. It's, you know, detailed and it's well colored and vivid and well-animated. I mean, it's the same studio that has made FMA and FMAB.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 - Holy crap, the opening is so badass that it makes me want to listen to it all day long. The soundtrack is pretty good, also. But most of the 9 is about the opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 - The characters have good personalities and Yato's pretty badass. Bishamon is also cool, if you know what i mean ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). But seriously, why doesn't Bishamon wear a t-shirt or close her jacket? Anyway they have nice characterystics.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - Man, i hoped SOOO MUCH for the sequel. And it came :D But we're talking about the prequel or the normal Noragami or, i don't know.\\n\r\nAnyway, every episode of this makes me want more. More. MORE EPISOODES. I'm now watching the sequel, so it's nor finished yet, so i pretty much rage after the last episode i can watch ends.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - I had so much fun with this show! It has everything! Like, non-sense comedy, normal comedy, good action, not-OP gods, good art, good characters, everything! It's pretty much underrated, but what can i say? It's just a theory. An ANIME Theory!

            "content": "Noragami is great in terms of humorous content, art style and music that hits at the right pauses. \r\nThough, it could have used some depth in the story as my main issue with most anime nowadays is that the context speeds up to its climax way too fast. Some other series have done it rather brilliantly but Norgami, you missed the mark.\r\n**Light spoilers ahead, so please tread carefully!**\r\nNoragami celebrates the beautiful concept of humans tainting the god they're connected to. Shinki as we know by watching the first two episodes rather, are souls of humans that are not yet tainted by dread. Once turned intoa shinki, any kind of malicious thought may sting their master i.e. the god they are tied to. I think its a rather precious relationship between God and Man that the writer of noragami has tried to depict and he does so masterfully, continuing to increase the bond of said story.\\n\\n\r\nThough, as the story progresses, its kind of obvious of the love interest that shall establish between god and human, which is a pro and a con at the same time, as it sates the appetite of the watcher and kind of kills the suspense throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development could have used more depth. \\n\\n\r\nYato is pretty much your generic wannabe-protagonist who is likable to the extent that nearly everyone is ready to help him. Yukine is your clueless and heplful protagonist (quite generic there as well) and Hiyori, your generic all-kind and loving heroine.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, its a humorous anime and is quite entertaining to watch, so I'll give it a modest 7.5/8.\\n",

            "content": "I think its pretty obvious where the fan base draws. The % of boys and girls who enjoy this series very much is split. Truth is probably 70%+ girls find Noragami to be much more entertaining than guys... probably cause Yato is visually stunning in physical appearance.\r\nThat's not to say guys aren't a victim of this also. Series that please both genders that are gut wrenching, fun and touching are preferably ones I'd lean towards.\r\nLet me start off with that Norgami is very lacking and did not deliver what I expected, and of course my expectations were pretty HIGH due to the amount ofrecommendations and seeing as to how it is #1 on a lot of peoples anime lists whom of which ranked it above particular series that I found mind blowing, seat shaking, heart aching tear jerkering, nerve racking, overall explosive.\\n\r\nSO I WAS THINKING THAT THIS ANIME WOULD ASCEND ME TO HEAVEN! \\n\r\nAnd... it didn't do anything but be very very very average. I was not shaking in my seat really wanting the next episode and this series did not make my heart ache so bad, nor was it a tear jerker.\\n\r\nIn fact, there are plenty of other series similar to Noragami but deliver much more impact, which I will list at the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10:\\n\r\nYato, the god of war basically is unknown to the modern age compared to other Japanese gods such as the god of luck, etc. \\n\r\nIf a god is forgotten, it will greatly harm them, hence Yato runs an odd jobs business, doing any job for about \\n\r\n(5 yen)5cents USD. Hiyori, your typical teenager saves Yato one day but for some reason didn't die because she has some quirk or something special. Here we follow the adventures of Yato as he tries to survive in the modern era where gods are being forgotten. \\n\r\nI've seen this plot in (Odd jobs aspect)Black Cat, Gintama, Bleach(with the whole boy meets girl situation) and various others. \\n\r\nIt's not that the story was bad but it was poorly delivered. They eventually go off on their own(too fast for my tastes) and strayed from the fun \"will do anything for 5 yen\" formula.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound 10/10:\\n\r\nGreat. I liked the opening. Very fluid animation, nothing to complain about really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\r\nYato supposedly is every girls dream guy(in real life, not the series). Hard working, very hot, playful, strong, mysterious etc.\\n\r\nHis character is pretty fine but very bland? Similar to Kirito from SAO and that main character from \"The Irregular at magical highschool\", these characters are very static, and a little robotic. I mean he does have some traits that make him unique but nothing that leaves a dent in my memory.\\n\\n\r\nHiyori: most typical highschool female heroine..... 0/10 character, I forget of her existence sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nYukine: Very annoying teenage kid. Also hardly anything that stands out other than I guess he appears \"cute\"?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10:\\n\r\nAs said earlier, I wasn't blown out of my seat itching to watch the next episode as the atmosphere drags me into the show. I didn't really feel the heart warming inducing story that would make my eyes teary. \\n\r\nIf any how, seeing Yukine develop was pretty annoying as it went back and forth with this mushy concept of \"purity\" and how you have to be withdrawn from the 7 sins, particularly lust and greed.\\n\r\nThe action was meh, towards the end it got pretty good but not good enough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10:\\n\r\nOK series. Though Black Cat, Gintama, Assassination Classroom, Bleach and Inyuuasha are series with very similar aspects that deliver much more impact. \\n\r\nThis series was really an \"ideal boy meets girl and takes her away from normal life\"... \\n\r\nThere's not much that stands out from this series that makes me want more or prefer it over a different series. The characters were pretty average, the plot was good but didn't deliver well overall\\n\r\nthis is a very lacking series.\\n\r\nAnd the last 4ish? Episodes were filler... soooooooooooooooooooooo ... all it did was push the Hiyori-Yato ship... personally I even noticed: \" this doesn't seem like the style I've been watching so far...\"\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Wow. The fantasy world itself is vaguely, and by that metric poorly, explained, but just done enough to let us understand some of the feelings for the characters drama to come through. The rest is left up to the viewers mind to very easily piece together the incoherence of the premise. Lack of focus and creativity leads the author to pitfall into the classic trope of stumbling through the climax through pure shonen, while the entire point of that genres use is architecturally auxiliaryto the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAside from one, the entire shows cast is never explored. The author even insults us by iterating a disgustingly common writing habit of completely changing what was the initial premise of one of the main cast for an attempt at some sort of pseudo depth. I consider actions like this to be blatant lying to the audience. Changing a characters backstory several episodes later isn't a twist, it's retconning. And as you can assume, opportunities to answer questions of the audience for actually interesting development are missed, furthering infuriation at the authors lack of competence.\\n\\n\r\nArt is standard. Sound is above standard. Without the well doing of the audio department, many of the scenes would probably fall flat and rank this show even lower. All in all though, mediocre.

            "content": "Noragami hits all the good spots. It is my favorite shounen series.\r\nNoragami is very reminiscent to popular shounen series like Bleach, Naruto, Full Metal Alchemist, etc. In other words, it's all about story with cool battles, comedy, and then a punch to your gut. We have our goofy main character who intermittently becomes serious and unsurprisingly has some sad, dark moments. We have our archetypal high school sideline chick. \r\nWhat makes Noragami stand out from all others is that I found its combination of everything - romance, comedy, tragedy, plot progression, action, character design, music - to be perfect (for me). The story is wellthought out and paced. Uncharacteristic to most shounen genres is that Noragami prioritizes relationships and characters. The story IS the characters. Battles, comedy, and eventual events that build up the story all support the characters rather than the other way around.  I found it impressive how the author was able to weave seemingly independent storylines back into one progression. I haven't watched another series where I found myself laughing  ... then holding my sobs ... then laughing ... then crying with such frequency AND during the entire time, the plot and battle scenes continue to occur smoothly. OST is also very on point in supporting the story. The OP hypes up the audience, and soundtrack compels me to be even more sad, tense, or excited. That being said, I am rating the story while knowing how the story continues in the manga. As a standalone, these 12 episodes may seem more lackluster. Because I know how the story continues, and I thought the anime adaptation completely exceeded my expectations, I am able to say this is my favorite series.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Noragami is underrated, and if you haven't watched it, you should.\\n\\n",

            "content": "God of War Yato at your service for just the cost of a five yen coin. This anime had received a huge amount of praise. It holds much mystery with the world of the Gods but mainly focusing on three protagonist which consist of Yato, Sekki, and Hiyori. It leans on more the comedy aspect with intense moments.\r\nGomenasai like always but minor spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk.\r\nStory: 7\r\nA small cutscene starts us off with our Yato being a slayer of the a 'Phantom' which are the creatures that consume and are the evil existence of the human world. Yato 'Shinki' which is hisweapon that was once a living person, which died prematurely. Decides to leave him to find a better God to serve, leaving Yato weaponless.\\n\\n\r\nOur story starts with Hiyori a highschool student going on about her everyday life. Until her faith is intertwined with a Yato a God without a Shrine working on any task at the cost of a five yen coin. His current task is finding a cat known as 'Milord'. Eventually, he spots Milord in the middle of street with a bus going at a rapid speed. Hiyori spots Yato and pushes him aside to take the fault and hit. She's rushed to the Hospital, were Yato comes to check up on her. Hiyori is soul is separated from her body becoming a wandering soul where it's in the state of the living and dead. \\n\\n\r\nHiyori thus pays Yato to restore her to her original state. Although it it\u2019s Yato main task right away having other side jobs. That\u2019s really the first episode with very vague detail. Yukine comes in later into the picture, the first few episodes are filler and establishment a feel of their world that\u2019s incorporated with Phantoms. The first few episodes are filler but are pleasant it starts picking up around episode five taking its first real arc centered around Yato and Yukine.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 7 | 8\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is gorgeous without a doubt. There weren't any drops in quality that were too noticeable. Phantom should have been characterized or have a more appealing design but that\u2019s not to much of a trouble. Everyone has distinct and unique design nothing too absurd nor believe. Even Kofuku was the most eye-catching character with her pink characteristics and one of my favorite side characters. The fight scenes felt like were most of the budget went towards to even if they were short. The Opening Ost nice and easy flowing, but distinct from the show being that it was more on serious tone unlike the show overall comedy aspect but the Ending Ost wasn't all that great didn\u2019t keep me watching but visually was more appealing than the Opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nYato is driving force without a doubt. A God with much mystery, backstory, and harsh past. Often times his past seems to haunt him and label him the person he doesn\u2019t seem to be. His personality is often a silly one trying to make the best of a situation and when he needs to take a serious tone you can feed of from his expression and know when something going down. He\u2019s really a charismatic and deep person. Each one of his actions have very much meaning and though even if they seem cruel at times. \\n\\n\r\nHiyori on the other half is pleasent surprise a bit dense airhead that's fanatic of Wrestling World. Having her new profound abilities she's able to hold her own being able to against Phantoms. She\u2019s the common sense and the brains of the operation of times when Yato & Yukine seem to get in trouble.\\n\\n\r\nYukine is Yato new 'Shinki' a Katana that died a young age, around Hiyori age. He's incredibly stubborn and hot head being a nuance to Yato since Master and Shinki share mind and body. Being a teenage boy there are troubles since he seemed to have trouble past that doesn\u2019t expand in this season. He doesn\u2019t receive the most character development at the main Arc focuses on him the most.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy anime that are built from the ground up. However, I wish the world was affected more by the Phantoms they weren\u2019t or didn\u2019t seem like to much of a trouble. It did feel overhyped but it was definitely a surprise anime from that season.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts/Overall: 7\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d say give a this Noragami a shoot. You shouldn\u2019t drop until you reach past the halfway point as the first 3-4 episodes are really filler with establishment of the world and giving us an insight of their personalities. Each character is fun and are there own believable person that you feel for and care for. The first season was without a doubt setting itself up for a Second Season giving us all these other Gods that will perhaps take a larger role in the Second Season",

            "content": "This review might be a little biased, but I feel that's okay. I haven't seen very many good reviews for this anime, which is a little crazy to me since I basically became obsessed only on the first episode.\r\nI just had to give a 10 in every category.\r\nFirst of all, the art was absolutely outstanding. It's hard to keep fighting so fluid and monsters and sceneries so detailed but the creators of this anime did just that. The sound was also amazing. Whoever was in charge of music hit it out of the ballpark so to speak in the aspect that they were able toset a tone and make it so clear whether or not it was a light-hearted tone, a serious one, or a scary one. Next is character. To me, character development is so important and the main characters all went from being selfish or childish to someone who was strong and independent. Even some of the side characters developed. Lastly is enjoyment. This anime had me on the edge of my seat (well more like on the edge of my bed) scene after scene whether it was a romance scene, a fighting scene, a circumstance that showed character development, etc. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, this anime had a little bit of everything that I look for in an anime. That includes humor, romance, fighting, character development, friendship, and supernatural beings. If you look for any or all of those, I HIGHLY recommend this anime. I have seen a lot of anime and even after watching over 100, Noragami is still my favorite and probably will be for a while.",

            "content": "This one's a bit of a mixed bag. Noragami focuses on middle school student Hiyori who winds up having her spirit blurring the line between the living and spirit worlds after she saves a young man named Yato from being hit by a bus, who actually turns out to be a god trying to raise money from fulfilling wishes to those who seek his services and slays ayakashi trying to negatively influence humans facing situations of duress in the living world. While trying to help Hiyori with her unique predicament, Yato gains possession of Yukine, a spirit that can turn into a sword that Yatocan use to slay ayakashi threats, and finds himself coming to grips with his past in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami spends much of its time exploring the spiritual world that makes up the series and focusing on the God/ Shinki bonds that make it up. Within the series, Shinki are spirits that become bonded to Gods that serve as their tools to fight against corrupt threats. As gods don't exist with concepts of human sins and have their life force linked directly to a Shinki, the Shinki must keep their desires and thoughts in check lest the emotions and thoughts are felt by the god and cause them to suffer. If the Shinki gives in too much to negative emotions and desires, it has the negative effect of causing the god to eventually die from being corrupted by their Shinki's sins. This dynamic is explored throughout much of Noragami's run as it explores the relationship between Yukine and Yato as the former tries adjusting to their unique union and finds himself giving into temptations from not being among the living world any longer. Hiyori finds herself trying to assist Yukine and Yato in their uneasy relationship and dealing with ayakashi threats as she becomes a source of support for the two in their ordeals. The drama facing their developments is the highlight of the series as the bond between the three is a genuine one that gradually develops throughout the course of the anime's run, particularly when things with Yukine's ordeal get resolved in the ninth episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe major components to Noragami that make it a mixed bag have to do with its comedy and exploration of Yato's character. I'll first cover the comedy since it's the more straight-forward to address. The series often mixes in comedic elements that show exaggerated takes on some of the character's notable quirks such as Yato's obsession for money and Hiyori's love of professional wrestling. Noragami is smart enough to known when to add in its comedic scenes so they don't intrude upon more serious moments in the series, though I did find the gags it pulled to be a bit hit and miss in terms of timing. The comedy does really miss its mark during an early episode when it does an exaggerated fall scene where Yato and pals are trying to help a down-on-his-luck office worker avoid committing suicide through recalling the true identity of his lover.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's exploration of Yato's past also has its high and low points. On the one hand, it is a major component of Yato's character as the bonds he establishes with Yukine and Hiyori allow him to establish positive relationships that allow him to appreciate things in the present as early episodes hint to him having a rather violent and dark past and he actively avoids relations with a Shinki named Nora due to her reminding him of this. His past does get fleshed out in the final three episodes of the series when confronted by a former comrade he had, though this story arc does suffer in quality due to some rather rushed plot development as these episodes lack the solid pacing given to the development of Yato and Yukine's developing relationship. This issue also extends to a plot during the middle of Noragami's run when Yato comes at odds with Bishamonten, a war god with a past grudge to settle with him. While an interesting plot development, Noragami never goes into a great deal of depth on exploring what led to their issues. Much of this is more likely due to the show's manga source material still being ongoing and will likely be more explored with the show's current season airing, Noragami Aragoto.\\n\\n\r\nStill in spite of its flaws, Noragami is a decent supernatural action title that offers a good deal of development and chemistry on the relationship that develops between Yato, Yukine and Hiyori; as well as offering a good deal of exploration on the spiritual world that makes up the series. It's still worth a look if you like anime titles influenced through Eastern folklore with their story elements.",

            "content": "Noragami is an enjoyable anime. I find Yato's personality quite likable and the concept of the phantoms really nice. The anime has both playful and serious times and maintains a good balance between the two. \r\nStory:6\r\nNoragami is defiantly not original. I say that it is a mix between Soul Eater and Kamisama Kiss but that is not really bad. The creators provided a nice anime even if the plot is quite normal and generic. If the anime was given more episodes then I think the story would develop much better and since I am caught up with the second season I can say that itis. Since there are only 12 episodes and 22 minutes with each episode, it is understandable that the story is quite underdeveloped. \\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nThe art is quite beautiful. The phantoms' designs are very nice and does well with giving the monsters a supernatural look. What really caught my eyes was when Yato would either summon something or destroy a phantom. Just looking at the ruins encrypted onto the animation was amazing. It gave him and other gods a heavenly glow. The style of the opening theme is really nice too. The monochrome animation with hints of color really works with the song that plays with it. It also makes every character unique with each character having a completely different eye color.\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nI LOVE the OST. I reminds me of the Danganronpa: Goodbye Despair OST which is amazing. I especially love the music that plays when Yato is about to kill a phantom. It gets me so pumped up and is so memorable. I am also addicted to the opening of the anime. Hello Sleepwalkers is a fun song in the anime and also if you just listen to it. The whole entire soundtrack is so memorable and I have listened to the soundtrack alone and I can tell you that some of the songs made me want to hide under my bed because of how dark and creepy it was.\\n\r\nCharacters:7\\n\r\nIt is mostly made up of generic characters which is pretty boring. I find Hiyori quite annoying at times and even Yato. I wished they explored more into Yukine; his character really did interest me. I do give the creators credit to be able to show the audience how close the threesome were. There were many times where I would just smile at the fun that the three were having together. I really enjoyed the God of Poverty's, Kofuku, character. I had some problems with Tenjin's character and found myself very confused at what I thought of him. I would love him sometimes but at other times I would want to kill him. I really like the character designs of all of the characters but especially Yukine's outfit with his cute beanie and blue hoodie. \\n\r\nIn concludsion, Noragami is an okay anime that could of done better if it was longer. Good thing that Noragami Aragoto came out because this anime deserves it. \\n",

Personally, I can't watch animes which don't have sufficiently qualified drawings if their story and characters aren't amazing.\r\nSound 10/10\r\nCharacters have sounds which fit in to their disappearance. And I also learned that Yato's seiyuu is samewith Levi's(Shingeki no Kyojin) and Yukine's seiyuu is same with Eren's(Shingeki no Kyojin) seiyuu.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters are funny(especially Yato), strong and I can say that they have all the properties that a successful anime's character should have. There isn't any very emotional character(this is a thing that I appreciate) and all of them are lovely. And I think, even if you don't like the story(but I am PRETTY sure that you will LOVE it) you can watch this amazing anime just for its characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nBecause of the things that I had listed above, I enjoyed it a lot.

In not many too shows, you get to see a God being humanized like the way they did in Noragami. But, the fact we get to see him in such a state struggling to find worshippers is one of those qualities that make Noragami especially stand out. \\n\\n\r\nAt first I was skeptical about the pairing of a human girl with a God, because I didn\u2019t see the point of that unless they trying to include some irrelevant romance.\\n\\n\r\nBut, despite having some very tender and subtle romantic vibes, I love how Noragami decided to focus more on developing the relationship between our three characters instead. Where after twelve episodes you can actually say that, \u2018damn, they make a really good team.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nOther than the ever so great Yato, we have our main female character Hiyori Ikki. She is your typical high school girl with minor tsundere traits and an unusual love for kick boxers. \\n\\n\r\nHiyori reminded me so much of Nanami from Kamisama, mainly because they are both strong and cute girls, who don\u2019t really stand out all that much. Sure Nanami became a total boss by the end of season 2, and I hope it will be the same case for Hiyori.\\n\\n\r\nWow, I can\u2019t go a second without comparing this to Kamisama can I? \\n\r\nEven though, she is overshadowed by the likes of Yato, I must say that without her the show would have been dreadful. Mainly, because from her perspective we not only get a better understanding of Yato\u2019s character, but also his world. She helps to move the story along and also contributes a lot in helping Yato towards the second half.\\n\\n\r\nThe last main character is Yukine, Yato\u2019s shinki (divine weapon possessed by Gods),who is basically just like a meister\u2019s weapon in Soul Eater. Out of the three, he probably got the most character development throughout the series and it was a breath of fresh air to see him grow as a character. And even though the show\u2019s main selling point is Yato and Hiyori pairing\u2019s, I must admit I just adored the relationships  Yukine had with them. Like I said earlier they make a good team, and so far I am glad that even though the show gives importance to friendship very subtly, and not necessarily by not shoving it down your throats, and making us believe that friendship is the answer to all the problems!\\n\\n\r\nLong running shounen anime series, I am looking at you! \\n\\n\r\nAs for the bad bits, Noragami\u2019s pacing was off during the first half off the show. I considered dropping it mainly because of how little plot progression there was. I, at first loathed that in every episode all we got were a few laughs and just a random battle with a phantom thrown at the end. It felt very episodic and not necessarily the good type of episodic. That, however changed half way between the show, and to my surprise I couldn\u2019t help but want to watch the next episode. It\u2019s a feel feeling which I did not have before episode 6!\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists in my opinion didn\u2019t really stand out and felt like unnecessary characters at times. Bishamon might be a badass who\u2019s reasons for hating Yato are acceptable, but it felt as if she hardly had any purpose to serve in the show, for the most part. Sure, that changes in the second season but in this one her character didn\u2019t make the show any better. Her regalia on the other hand, despite not getting much screen time was more relevant to the show than she was.\\n\\n\r\nRabo and the titular Nora, were just downright despicable and not even in the entertaining type of way, like Gilgamesh from Fate/Zero or Lust from Fullmetal Alchemist. \\n\\n\r\nRabo might have had more relevance to the plot than BIshamon, but unlike her his, rivalry towards Yato was not properly conveyed. Sure, you can make an argument and say he did what he did along with Nora because they are evil or they want Yato to be like his old self again, but I wish they were was just more to it than just that!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for the show was done by Studio Bones, and they did a great job in making everything look really fresh and clean. I guess the animation quality however wasn\u2019t really consistent and only stood out during certain scenes of the show. Also, there was also a small issue with the contrast of colors in some scenes, but that shouldn\u2019t be too big of a problem. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening of the show, it suits it so perfectly that I don\u2019t even have words to explain. Yeah, it took me some episodes to fully fall in love with it, but nonetheless it is an epic opening that helps the show be a little bit funkier. In fact, you can imagine Yato walking down on the streets with his hands in his pockets like a badass, while this song plays in the background. \\n\r\nThe ending of the show was satisfying and was a good stopping point, until season 2.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, an English dub of the show recently came out which is average at best. Sure, I prefer the subbed version more, but if you have a short attention span and don\u2019t want to read subtitles then you can definitely watch this dub.  Jason Liebrecht as Yato is actually decent, and even though his performance isn\u2019t better than that of Kamiya Hiroshi. He did however do a good job at capturing Yato\u2019s personality. I also like Micah Solusod as Yukine, and I am glad to see him in more English dubs, because he is a fantastic voice actor. And what a weird coincident that he is again playing the role of someone\u2019s weapon again. \\n\\n\r\nSo, overall I enjoyed Noragami and would have loved this season even more if it wasn\u2019t for its lackluster first few episodes, but none the less, it managed to redeem itself towards the end which I am grateful for\\n\\n\r\nI think that Noragami is worth the watch! \\n",

            "content": "Noragami or as translated in English \"Stray God\" is an anime written by Adachitoka was aired in Japan March of 2014 by Bones. Noragami is a great animation that offers a mature script and combines comedy with the actual serious plot.\r\nGraphics/ Art: Noragami has Awesome art as the graphics engine is great. In general the world is made with great detail and the characters design is very good especially with their emotional expressions. Of course it has some special \"effects\" for the combat but it is not so much as other animes, you can say its not extreme. The most fighting is about combat movementsinstead of \"energy\" skills. Also the colors of the animation are exactly as they should be and they offer a fantasy experience.\\n\r\n The opening is awesome , not spoiling the whole animation but just showing some things and the music is awesome. The OST's are the best and if you own a surround system you are gonna have an awesome time listening to them especially if you watch this in HD quality which i recommend!\\n\\n\r\nPlot: We are in a world where the Gods actually exist. They live on peoples prayers and offers and as the people remember then and pray to them they get more power and are greater gods! One of our first protagonists is Yato, a god that is fighting to survive in a world where no one remembers him and will do almost anything for anyone. Yato being left by his weapon is trying to fight evil spirits from this world when he gets a new weapon, a young boy named Yukine. Yukine is still young and cannot recognise and respect fully a god, so they have a few problems in their relationship which leads Yukine to soul corruption. They also meet a young girl named Hiyori which has an ability to see and sense spirits and gods. Hiyori by mistake becomes half demon and occasionally loses her body.\\n\\n\r\n(SPOIL) What no one knows yet is that Yato is a very old God of Calamity that has killed countless people and souls in order to survive and his past will bring problems to everyone!\\n\\n\r\nIn Depth Plot(Spoil): The way that the animation describes its world is very good and gives you a realistic style of Gods that actually exist and people can see them but forget almost immediately they exist. It gives you the feeling of loneliness they get because they are surrounded by people but they are practically alone. Also i believe that the names of the Gods used are actual Japanese gods used by mythology.\\n\r\nYukine has to deal with the fact that he is dead and forget about the things he wanted to do as alive. He no longer remembers his past life and as he sees people his own age with a family and friends he is jealous so in the first part of the series we see a lot of Yukine's personality Development. He has to accept that bad things happen to everyone , not only him and to learn how to deal with them.\\n\r\nYato is a God that has done terrible things in his past and he is trying to break new and forget all about it by becoming a good god and doing good deeds. A character named Nora follows him as Nora is his former weapon. Nora means Stray and is a weapon owned by many gods at the same time. Nora weapons are used to do actions a god would never place his actual weapon to do. This will bring much trouble to him as an old friend or foe is searching for him.\\n\r\nHiyori is always mocking Yato that he is a slacker which is not actually true as Yato gets jobs for 5 yen and does them all and constantly exploits him to fix her body that has been half demon due to \"bad timing\" i would say. In general Hiyori has a strange character and doesn't actually knows what she wants, but in general thought she is a kind character. Actually she could be a character with a personality disorder...",

            "content": "I have never been more thoroughly impressed with an anime's pacing than I was watching Noragami, and by far that is its greatest strength. From start to finish, it has this wonderful flow of comedy, action and a healthy mix of drama contributing to the plot that makes for a very well-rounded story. The most impressive part is that every episode manages to be engrossing without ever feeling rushed. So much happens and yet you never get the sense that something important has been skimmed over or left out.\r\nI don't want this review to be too involved, but what you need to know about thisshow is that its characters have interesting development and appreciable design barring maybe Bishamon, whose skimpy outfits are jarring with reference to the other characters. The story centres around a wandering god (noragami) who tries his best to fulfill the wishes of others in an effort to avoid being forgotten. He comes off as incredibly earnest, and you can't help but fall for his charm as the show develops. It draws you in and makes you a fan.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and background work to bring forth the vibrant characters and themes. All of this works together synergistically to become one of the best anime I've watched in a long time; I'd even go so far as to say it's a new favourite.\\n\\n\r\nYou owe yourself the pleasure of watching Noragami. It's short, fast-paced, but never rushed. It's a brilliant experience, and one I'd highly recommend.",

From episode one this series had me hooked, not to mention that Yato was my first anime crush haha. It was the eyes. Anyway, I loved the story this anime portrayed. It has fighting in it, but it's much more than that. The relationships between the characters are beautiful. The emotions this anime put me through was bittersweet. I also love the fact that the characters aren't complete tsunderesor airheads. There's something to love about all of them. This series had everything; action, drama, romance, and comedy. It has something for everyone. I recommend this anime to everyone.",

            "content": "We know for a fact that using the shinto gods as main characters is a very risky course of action for the progress of anime/manga. Because there are numerous gods in the shinto religion, it is a necessity to have a considerable knowledge on it and know as many gods as possible. Also, because of their status as gods, they are usually portrayed as an absolute evil or absolute goodness, which results in a boring story.\r\nNoragami is the anime that breaks these rules.\r\nFollowing the most human-like god in the history, Yato, and his company shinki (regalia) yukine and his \"follower\" Hiyori, the story does anexcellent job in entwining the godhood with humanness and produce yatogami.\\n\\n\r\nThen, without haste, let's start with the review.\\n\\n\r\nps. Unless your IQ is over 300, there are no spoilers in this review that you can pick up without problem.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (8+5)/2=6.5\\n\\n\r\nThe story part is divided into two parts: the one that appears in the actual manga, and the filler 3 episodes, and we learned what filler does to the overall anime in one failed masterpiece called Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S. Although some fillers have wonderful cohesion with the actual story, this one, unfortunately, does not.\\n\\n\r\nThe first part follows the story of Yukine and Yato, and is a developmental story of Yukine as he becomes a true regalia from a spoiled brat. The touching return of the prodigal son is a scene enough to make this a masterpiece anime. The story develops nicely, with an exception of the ova--the falling man, which is why I gave only 8 out of 10. If the story of falling man was pushed into the actual ova or if it came in transition of the filler and the first part, or if it were just excluded from the first part and was used to develop the filler, this anime could have gotten a much higher score than 6.5.\\n\\n\r\nThe filler was actually not a half-bad job, developing a minor plot in the story and explaining the past of Yatogami. However, the reason I gave only 5 out of 10 was that the second part included a lot of cliche used in Dragon Balls and the like, which is never a good idea. Moreover, although it is understandable that the anime only had 12 episodes to fit the story, the story was too quick-paced. Like I said earlier, if the first part were rid of the unnecessary ova's and everyday lives and were used to lengthen and develop the filler, the anime could have easily gotten a 9 and possibly even 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe well-known producers of cowboy bebap, darker than black and the like, in short the animes with the greatest battle scenes, Bones does a wonderful job of animating the battle scenes and the rending of the ayakashis, or the shinto demons. The openings and the battle scenes and everything are wonderfully animated, possibly rivaling IG Entertainment. The only minor point that I cut off from the art segment is that in battle scenes of Yato and Rabo, the main antagonist of the filler, the battle scenes seems a lot less dramatized and less captivating. The positions of the camera are not rotating or under the two gods to dramatized the battle intensity, but right beside them and not even close to feel a little intensity. It was like watching two ants fight. Of course, there were also scenes where the two were zoomed up close to increase intensity, but major segment of the fights were an ant-fight. Still, I only cut off 1 point because it was a minor point and I still felt intense from the two's fight.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nBefore you run off mad from giving 9 for anime that has supercell, let me explain myself.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the OP/ED.\\n\\n\r\nIt's freakin' supercell. What more do you want? An anime rich enough to hire supercell deserves an 11. But of course, I gave a humiliating 10.\\n\\n\r\nSecond of all, BGM.\\n\\n\r\nThey did their jobs of heightening or serenading or saddening or sharpening the moods. When a BGM does their job, the viewers cannot ask more. I gave BGM 10 as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, the voice-acting.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a little difficult to grade.  We have the best of the best seiyuus in this anime, such as Hiroshi Kamiya, the seiyuu of the world's most famous gentleman pervert (and who taught us the strength of a toothbrush), Arararagi Koyomi (ah, i bit my tongue) and the strongest soldier and the coolest male of 2013, Captain Levi. We have Yuki Kaji, the famous loser-voice-actor who portrayed Yukine's voice perfectly, Jun Fukuyama, the eternal glasses and the smart-cookie, portraying the sum of Lelouch and Yukio perfectly, and Aki Toyosaki, the woman who opened a brand new segment of anime history by her \"cute\" chipmunk voice.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, again, the filler did a disappointing job at using these amazing seiyuus.\\n\\n\r\nThe most disappointing of all was how Yato was grunting every 5 seconds. It certainly does make me happy to hear Hiroshi Kamiya, but done too much and it starts to annoy anyone, even if it were said by Hiroshi. This also breaks off the mood. Sometimes silence and a flash of a shocked face is more heightened than grunting. If the anime mixed the grunt and silence appropriately, the rating could have gotten a 9.\\n\\n\r\nAnother disappointing thing that, this time,  only the filler does, is how Yato goes \"Yoooooooh!\" every 10 seconds. I get it, you're swinging your sword at full strength, but like I said, too much is never a good idea. This makes the viewers feel a little corny or weirded out, like how people feel while watching the newest Yu-Gi-Oh or old Pokemon. If the number of yells were decreased, I would have given 11 for sound.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in the end, I gave the most disappointed 8 for the voice over, resulting in a humiliating 9 for, I say again, supercell.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe character development of all the characters is fairly nice, and I was going to give this segment a 9.\\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't for the filler again.\\n\\n\r\nYabo is a god that appears conveniently and disappears just as conveniently. If he were hinted at the first part or were developed more thoroughly by, again, lengthening the filler, the anime could have easily gotten a 9.\\n\\n\r\nStill, all the characters are adorable and a fun to watch. So I give 7 for the character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nYato's adventure, Yukine's development and Hiyori's firmness were an amazing combination. The sort-of -love between Yato and Hiyori weren't done in a twilight style. The battle intensity also captivated me, and Kofuku's, another god, adorableness soared above the heavens itself. The anime was, despite the disappointing end and the filler, a fun to watch. For that, I gave 8 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nGreat art, the greatest sound, and great story for the first half. It is worth watching 5 times and if the second series gets out, I will leap in joy. Go watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThen, again, happy anime-ing.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS\r\nHello everybody, Master Iruka, better known as my real name, Brady, and I recently completed an anime by the name of Noragami, an action - comedy - drama - mecha - slice of life - harem - psychological thriller - hentai anime, about a god named Yato, a lazy, homeless, and mostly useless god who one day wishes to have his own shrine dedicated to himself and have millions upon millions of religious follows across Japan. But, in order to collect money to one day get his dream shrine, he does odd jobs and delivery for anyone who will hire him.But, after his constant homelessness and failure after failure in everything he does, his weapon partner, or Regalia, or divine instrument, or whatever the term is depending on what translation you watched, leaves him homeless and alone. Just as things begin to turn south for Yato, his fortune changes for the better when he meets 16 year old girl Hiyori Iki, who saves him from a car accident, taking the hit for him. Luckily, she survives, but, that same event caused her soul to become \u201cloose\u201d and allows her to leave her own body. She demands Yato helps turn her back to normal, but once finding out that Yato needs a new weapon partner to help her, she, reluctantly, agrees to help him find a new one. And together, Yato\u2019s luck may be finally turning around. But, with a campy monster-o\u2019-tha-week type concept like that, will the show have execution to match? Or will it be a bland, boring, and unfunny show? Well, let\u2019s look. But first, let\u2019s look at the people behind this show\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\t(Headline : Staff Overview)\\n\\n\r\n\tNoragami was originally a action-shounen manga created by mangaka Adachitoka, who also did the artwork for another manga, Alive : The Final Evolution which ran for 7 years in monthly shounen magazine. Noragami itself is serialized in monthly shounen magazine as well, which has run popular manga such as Your Lie in April, Beck, and Violence Jack, the first two of which were also turned into very well received anime series as well. The manga has been running for over 6 years now, since December 23rd, 2010, and in the winter 2014 season, received an anime adaptation as well by Studio Bones, creators of such influential series as Eureka Seven, My Hero Academia, Ouran Host Club, Soul Eater, and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. The series is directed by Koutarou Tamura, known for working on Wolf Children, Baccano, Negima, and Sword Art Online. The show also features music from the legendary Taku Iwasaki, the soundtrack composer behind Akame ga Kill, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Gatchaman Crowds, JoJo\u2019s, Black Butler, Soul Eater, and a billion other amazing anime soundtracks. The show features voice acting from some of my personal favorite voice actors in the industry, including Hiroshi Kamiya, who has also performed in Angel Beats, Attack on Titan, and Monogatari, plays main character Yato, Maya Uchida, who has also starred in Love, Chuunibyou, and other Delusions, Gatchaman Crowds, Dan Machi, and Hunter x Hunter, plays Iki Hiyori, Yuki Kaji, who has performed in Accel World, Arslan Senki, Bananya, Guilty Crown, and Kiznaiver, plays Yukine, and Toyosaki Aki, who has acted in K-On, Spice and Wolf, Knights of Sidonia, and Yuru Yuri, plays Kofuku. So, now that we know of the people who made the show, of which many of them are extremely talented, let\u2019s go ahead look at the show itself.\\n\\n\r\n\t(Headline : Characters)\\n\\n\r\n\tAs with any character driven show, Noragami has very good and likeable characters, and without a shadow of a doubt are the best part of the entire series. There is Yato, the lovable idiot, Yukine, the moody teen, Iki, the straight man, Kofuku, the silly but powerful goddess, Bishamon, the femme fatale, and some other, less notable characters. While yes, the characters do fall into common archetypes, that doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t ever get any development or aren\u2019t complex, and each character is easy to root for, except for the antagonists, of course. I mean, Yato alone his likeable enough to carry the show alone, nevermind all the other cool characters. But, as much as I personally love all the characters, there isn\u2019t a lot of character progression throughout the season, and not every character even has any development throughout the first season of this show. For instance, until episode 6, Yato, Yukine, and Iki basically don\u2019t change at ALL, until Yukine is shown feeling sad over not being able to be a normal kid anymore, and again in episode 8, when Yukine gets angry over not being able to have a group of friends anymore after visiting the nearby school, and destroys the windows of the building in a fit of rage, causing Yato to be blighted. The main trio does grow better as friends throughout the season, but very little. I mean, Iki and Yato\u2019s relationship develops more in the first 15 minutes of episode 1 than the entire rest of the show! I guess, in short, the characters in the show are likeable, and easy to root for, but rarely develop throughout the course of the show.\\n\\n\r\n\t(Headline : Animation, Soundtrack, and the Technical Stuff)\\n\\n\r\n\tStudio Bones has historically been known to make some gorgeously animated fight scenes and shows in general. From My Hero Academia, to Soul Eater and Mob Psycho 100. And, Noragami is definitely no exception to this rule. Not only does the show have some really good looking sakuga scenes, but the show as a whole looks pretty nice. The character designs and outfits are very distinct and memorable, not to mention just pretty good designs in general. Each design does a pretty good job of displaying the personality of each character, at least the main ones. From the menacing snake eyes of Bishamon to the tight tracksuit and rigged scarf that Yato wears, to the simple school uniform that Iki wears. The character animation is expressive and fluid, and can change from more realistic movement to silly, comedic movement, as shown in the opening theme. The backgrounds are decent, but fairly simplistic and mostly forgettable. Now, moving on to the soundtrack, like I previously stated in the staff overview, legendary soundtrack composer Taku Iwasaki composed the soundtrack for Noragami, and unsurprisingly, the soundtrack is great. Somewhat similarly, the voice acting in the series is pretty good as well. Toyosaki Aki and Hiroshi Kamiya\u2019s performances as Kofuku and Yato respectively really stand out for outstanding acting, which doesn\u2019t surprise me considering both actors previous works have also been equally good, if not, better. Overall, the soundtrack, voice acting, and animation are all pretty good, which really isn\u2019t shocking coming from such a prolific anime studio.\\n\\n\r\n\t(Headline : Comedy and Drama)\\n\\n\r\n\tSadly, now we need to talk about the weakest part about Noragami in my opinion, the comedy and drama featured in the show. Noragami may be an action show, and of course the action is pretty good, but the show is just as much a drama and comedy as it is action, which seriously sucks, mainly because the comedy and drama scenes in the show are really mediocre. The humour is pretty hit or miss, but never once have I more than cracked a smile, and I love comedy shows and find a lot of things funny, not to mention a show like K-On has me smiling throughout the entire runtime of the show, and a show like KonoSuba has me dying in laughter almost the whole way through. Some of the humour or more lighthearted or heartwarming scenes do make me smile every once and awhile, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever laughed during the show, which is very disappointing for a comedy show. And, yes, I get it, humour, for the most part is subjective, but it never really clicked for me. I\u2019m hoping that the second season is funnier, but I\u2019m not even sure if I really want to watch the second season if I felt that the first season was this disappointing to say the least, in the comedy department. What\u2019s even more poorly executed is the drama in the show. There is maybe 3 dramatic scenes in the entire show that hold any meaning to the plot, and I didn\u2019t even feel much emotion in them. The first is in episode 6, where Yukine steals a skateboard to feel like a kid again, which is pretty sad, you can really feel for Yukine during the episode, and when he realizes he can\u2019t do bad things or else Yato gets blighted, I really did feel how that just sucked for him, not being able to feel like a kid. But, the episode just kind of felt, generic, to say the least. I feel like I\u2019ve seen that same plot setup many times before, where a kid does something bad and learns how it\u2019s wrong. The next emotional, dramatic scene is in episode 8, where Yukine again feels rage after he can\u2019t have any friends since he can\u2019t live through childhood, and he smashes all the windows in the middle school, which eventually leaves to Yato being on the edge of death after near-fatal blighting, it's a similar and familiar setup, but with an \u201coh crap!\u201d twist that comes with it, which leads to the next emotional climax, the dangerous ritual to try and purify Yato and clear his blighting by gathering 3 regalias to help, which\u2026 didn\u2019t make me feel much of anything. How it ends is just obvious, and it's probably the most \u201cpredictable\u201d of these emotional, dramatic, plot-twistey moments. Not to mention, there are literally 3 episodes and an entire second season after Yato\u2019s fatal blight, so I\u2019m just going to assume he survives onward. Plus, the thumbnails of the next episodes on Crunchyroll literally show Yato perfectly fine, so it\u2019s obvious he survives. Overall, the comedy is mediocre and the drama is mostly uninteresting or predictable, and are obviously the weakest elements of the plot in Noragami. \\n\\n\r\n\t(Headline : Final Thoughts & Would I Recommend?)\\n\\n\r\n\tOverall, I think that Noragami is a show with loveable characters, an interesting concept, good action, good animation, and some great voice acting and backing soundtrack, but is sadly brought down by the mediocre, hit or miss comedy, and weak emotional moments that are very predictable, which is just as important as the action in an action-comedy. But, would I recommend Noragami? The short answer, yes. The long answer? Well, the comedy may be better for people with different comedic tastes as my own, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if other people got more invested in the emotional moments than I did in the show, and I think just about anyone can appreciate the good action scenes. So if you like action-comedy shows, give this a watch. But, with all things said, my final rating for Noragami, is 6.5 / 10.",

            "content": "\"There's a Girl That Rides a Lion So That's Cool\"\r\nNoragami\r\nRecently, I've been watching more and more anime. So far I've seen some of the highly recommended ones (SAO, AOT, etc.), but this month I watched an anime that I knew nothing about.\r\nThe show's called Noragami, which means (I think) \"Stray God.\" \r\nI thought it was quite good, and I'm here to give you my thoughts on the first and only season that premiered in early 2014.\r\nStory\r\nNoragami's world is one full of gods and creaturescalled phantoms, both of which exist between planes of existence.\\n\r\nThe \"stray god\" that also happens to be the main character in this show is Yato. Yato is a poorly dressed, goofy, and unpopular delivery god who is desperate to gain popularity and eventually build his own shrine.\\n\r\nAnother main character is Hiyori, a girl who after being hit by a bus becomes half-human/half-phantom.\\n\r\nShe has a pink tail.\\n\r\nPhantoms, by the way, are spirits from the \"Far Shore\" (basically the afterlife) that like to influence the minds of humans, normally in negative ways.\\n\r\nThe final main character is Yukine, Yato's Regalia.\\n\r\nWhat's a Regalia you ask?\\n\r\nWell, funny you should ask. Regalias are \"pure\" spirits that have not crossed over to the \"Far Shore.\" Once bound to a master, Regalias take a human-like form until called upon for battle. When this happens, the Regalias transform into weapons, clothing, and lions\u0085 I guess\u0085\\n\r\nI'm sure I at least got some of that wrong. I apologize for my very limited understanding behind the magic of Regalias.\\n\r\nAnyway, Yukine is kind of a punk, and as it turns out, when you act like a punk, your master pays the price, that price being death\u0085. eventual death.\\n\r\nYes, as Yukine becomes more and more\u0085 terrible, Yato's health decreases, which makes combating the many, many, people that Yato has angered very difficult.\\n\r\nThat's all I'm gonna say about the plot, because anymore might spoil some stuff. Let's just say that the story is diverse. Sometimes it's serious, sometimes it's funny, and it's always good.\\n\r\nArt Style\\n\r\nNoragami's art style is all about contrast. Most of the backgrounds are dull, dark colors, while the main characters and phantoms are colorful. The three main characters' eyes are bright colors (blue, pink, and orange) that kind of match their personalities.\\n\r\nIt's a pretty show.\\n\r\nVoice Acting\\n\r\nAt the moment, there is no dubbed version of this show. So I watched it in Japanese.\\n\r\nI don't speak Japanese\u0085. So I guess that's all I've got to say\u0085\\n\r\nAction\\n\r\nThere are some cool fight scenes in this show, but for the most part, Yato kills phantoms in one slice. When Yato actually fights other gods, however, the action increases and some memorable scenes ensue.\\n\r\nBut the final fight scene with Rabo could have been a lot better. Just sayin.\\n\r\nAward Time!\\n\r\nBest Episode: Where Happiness Lies\\n\r\nBest Regalia: The Lion that exists for no reason\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nNoragami is my favorite anime of 2014\u0085 mostly because it's the only anime that came out in 2014 that I watched.\\n\r\nBut it's still good! I give Noragami an 8/10.\\n\r\nWatch it and enjoy.",

            "content": "*short and spoiler free*\r\nIf you enjoyed Ao No Exorcist, you're gonna love Noragami too. There are quite a few similar elements in both the series. However, I can't state them without spoiling either or both the series for those of you who haven't watched them.\r\nAnyway, please know that you have to watch this anime with a pinch of salt. There are MANY unexplained situations, character motivations and plot holes. There is also poor character development, and some confusion which could have easily been solved with simple conversations. I also wish the Yuki arc was shorter, seeing how a lot more episodes were dedicated to hischaracter \"development\" as opposed to Yato's, who by the way is the protagonist of the show. And then there's the sudden jump from being a light hearted series about Yato and his struggles, to two big story arcs, which are full of action and drama. This tone carries forward into the second season as well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite the anime's flaws, I believe it was Yato and his lovable personality (not to mention his impish good looks and his unbelievably gorgeous eyes) that made it very enjoyable for me. I really liked the humour in the series and I only wish there was more of it. Sadly, it was sprinkled sparingly throughout the 2 seasons. But the 4 OVAs made up for that.\\n\\n\r\nI also really liked most of the musical score of the series, which is rare for me. \\n\r\n8.5/10 for the music. \\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who have watched Noragami, I highly recommend Ao No Exorcist.",

            "content": "If I was a God, I would be extremely nonchalant and mysterious so that when I go into ass kicking mode I seem twice as bad ass. Then again, I am pretty narcissistic and would want as many people to know of my badassery as possible...\r\nAnyway, if you came to this MAL page to look at Norogami and contemplate whether or not you should watch it, know this: The MAL page won't be able to tell you half of what this anime actually is. At a first glance, it looks pretty sciencey and brooding. On top of that, the synopsis makes it sound like Deathnote,but, don't be misled, Noragami is an incredibly colorful adventure with enough personality, humor and lightheartedness to give any other anime a proper run for its money.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\r\nNoragami, obviously, involves Gods. Now, as an English person, I have absolutely no idea how religion in Japan works. Luckily for me, Norogami not only does an amazing job of helping me understand who everyone is, but also provides them with detailed relationships, morals and personalities - more on that later though. Yato, as one of the pleb gods, has nothing to his name, not even a shrine. From there, you get your standard introductions and by episode 3 were all set for our wacky RomCom.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really know what to say about the story... The first bit is spent running around pretending to be Odd Jobs Gin while a typical teen rebellion stirs up in the background. The second bit seems to juuuuust squeeze in some of Yato's history.... Kind of like Gintama...\\n\\n\r\nYou know, this whole thing is a lot like Gintama...\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say its bad, of course, the story is fast passed and engaging with every episode being of relevance. One thing I will say though is that throughout the entire season they were playing Yato up to be some kind of nonchalant bad-ass but that never really went anywhere... which was disappointing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\r\nNoragami has some pretty smooth art, I don't usually put too much stock into it but this one looked very fine-tuned and provided an extra layer of environment whenever it was needed. Similarly, the art behind phantoms and purging phantoms was unique and pretty damn cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise... I didn't really like it. That's not to say it was bad. It just... wasn't my style - except for the intro (Its f*ckin delicious by the way). Of course, taste in music is subjective and my score represents that as unbiased  as possible.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\r\nI actually really enjoyed the cast of this show, they all had their own story to tell and they were all so appropriate for the role they had to play. The characters in this show, being super-duper old, have a long lasting relationship that varies between them. Some people are friends, some are enemies. The cute and cuddly one... Yeah, she's an uber-powerful warlord with a fan. Her beefy bodyguard/weapon... cooks....\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, our make-shift Odd Jobs Gin work really well as a main cast, even if the whole teenager vs girls thing gets a bit old after 5 minutes. As I said earlier, it would be nice if the whole 'mysterious bad ass' act actually paid off with a bang but eh... I guess Yato is cool none the less.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nI am so mad at myself for taking 3 months to pick this up. Its short, sweet and fun. The characters are a blast and leave so much to be expected of the 2nd season... Which I'm going to watch now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\r\nI can wholly recommend this season of Noragami, I can only hope that the second season turns out as good because this is an anime that will leave you wanting more and when I want more, I pull all nighters.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "tl;dr: An episodic series about an interesting cast of characters dealing with various problems, though with some themes that were somewhat grating.\r\nThis is an anime that's I would best describe as structured quite a bit like a slice of life\u00a0anime\u00a0but\u00a0with a good amount of plot that gets quite intense. What I mean by that is that so far, there's no real overarching plot. Sure,\u00a0Yato\u00a0wants to rise in the ranks and Hiyori wants to become normal, but these are far off things that don't really have much of an effect and are usually used for comedic affect rather than having any impact on the direction ofthe plot. The plot itself is composed of a number of smaller episodes that sometimes have some common story threads common between them, but for the most part\u00a0are\u00a0episodic in nature.\u00a0These smaller episodes largely have to do with dealing with various jobs that\u00a0Yato\u00a0is given, which usually involve fighting against phantoms, but often have to do with dealing with other problems various people are having as well. These parts sometimes have serious aspects to them, which can be interesting in that they show\u00a0Yato's\u00a0unique take on humanity and their interactions.\u00a0Though\u00a0for the most part, they're mainly amusing.\u00a0Yato\u00a0and\u00a0Kofoku\u00a0are amazingly hilarious, especially when together, the first OVA being a major testament to that, and also when interacting with the various other characters. And just in general, gods acting strange is a really funny concept they execute well.\u00a0The overarching threads largely have to do with character development, the two main ones in this season being\u00a0Yukine's\u00a0character development in coming to terms with who he is and overcoming his corruption,\u00a0and\u00a0Yato's\u00a0past and relationship with a regalia named Nora, who wishes for him to return to his violent self, though another thread regarding\u00a0Yato's\u00a0relationship with a god named\u00a0Bishamon\u00a0who hates him to the point of wanting to kill him is also touched upon.\u00a0These aspects were somewhat hit and miss for me.\u00a0Yato's\u00a0past and relationships I think are interesting and I do want to learn more about.\u00a0Yato, Hiyori, and\u00a0Yukine\u00a0are also developing what seem to be a really strong bond, so watching that develop is\u00a0also\u00a0really interesting. Yukine's whole character arc I really wasn't a fan of, though that could come down largely to personal preference, in that the whole troubled teen that's hard to deal with thing I really don't like so how long it took and how it was such a core aspect of most of this season grated on me. Still, that was wrapped up pretty well and seems to be over and it followed it up with a pretty strong arc to end on, so I was satisfied with how the show went overall.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, the general style to the world with the modern setting with a heavy focus on Shinto mythology came through really well. The action was stylish and looked flashy, though there wasn't much to it mechanically yet. The art and animation\u00a0were\u00a0pretty solid. The OP/ED were really good both audio and visually. The soundtrack also had a lot of really good unique tracks that seem to fit with\u00a0it's\u00a0Shinto based themes.\u00a0",

            "content": "Noragami is...well...mediocre. It has its ups and downs but sadly spends most of its time along the equator, motionless. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was a struggle to get through, but I simply wasn't engaged. The animation, soundtrack, art, and almost every part of it was average. Unlike some of my favourites, I wasn't waiting to get home from school just to power up my laptop and...uh...legally watch anime. Instead, I would put on an episode when I felt exceptionally bored or really didn't have anything else to do. Now, there's nothing wrong with the so-called \"filler\" anime (the ones youwatch in between shows you expect to be good) but this wasn't supposed to be one of those. To top it off, there's a mystery component regarding Yato's past. Did it make me care? Nope.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my complaints, I still gave the show a 7/10 overall. Yato is a magnificent character and, I mean, I'm not gay but... *clears throat* \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, he is complex and three dimensional - really the only reason I continued watching. Unfortunately, this doesn't apply to the rest of the cast. Every personality is bland, lacking any spice whatsoever. Yukine, a secondary character, is also unnecessarily edgy, almost like it was an attempt at creating another authentic character.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond this, the plot is subpar. Don't get me wrong, monsters invading the real world is a genius idea but it has been done one too many times already. As an experienced viewer, I was expecting something more, something with sincerity and genuine conflict, but this didn't happen. The first season of Noragami is simply a one-way ticket to the improved, refined, and rejuvenated season two, which is significantly superior.\\n\\n\r\n~Jackun",

His past was harsh and not salvation.\r\nFirst of all, Noragami is one of my awesomely favorite works. I love this series so much. Let's talk about first season's wonderfulness.\r\nCharacters are quite attractive. Yato, Hiyori Iki, and Yukine. They are freaking adorable. Just like family.\r\nEspecially Hitori is so cute. She is brave and try her best. She clutched my pure heart. I want to nab her seriously!\r\nShinki and Ayakashi. These setting are utilized enough. Nostory without these. Others also very nice.\\n\r\nFight scenes are stylish, cool, exhilarating. In a word, amazing. Later episodes are more great.\\n\r\nOf course, Art and animation in normal time are beautiful. You can enjoy this worldview of many handsome men and women fully. All hail, Bones!\\n\r\nMusic also colorize flamboyant this series. OP song is full of coolness. Sometimes I hum 'I was waiting there speechless' of OP Lyrics. I like it.\\n\r\nED song is in charge of supercell vocal (Bakemonogatari). Snow scenery in cooperation, fits this show very well.\\n\r\nStory is fairly simple though, feeling somewhat nostalgic. The first half is funny and comedic. The latter half is serious.\\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't mean atmosphere change completely. Modestly balance. You'll like Yukine from the latter half.\\n\r\nOh shoot. I forgot about Yato. He has good personality and reliable. I love this guy as same as other twosome. He is big brother of ideal.\\n\\n\r\nThis show (first season) has a little flaws. Bishamon and Kazuma's turn, highlight are little because they are sequel precondition.\\n\r\nDon't get them wrong. They also good characters. If this work has 2-cour from the first, you can see their activity. And more.\\n\\n\r\nIn whole, this show is really interesting. Too enjoyable. At the same time, story what focus main characters are warmness.\\n\r\nSecond season Aragoto is more sophisticated and tense. If you liked first season, worth a try. This series is spectacular for me. So I bought Complete Series.\\n\\n\r\n\"May God Bless You.\" - Yato",

I completely recommend Noragami!\r\nCharacters: 10/10\r\nThe characters are really well designed and all of them have complete backstories that are important to the plot of the anime, which is great.\r\nSoundtrack: 9/10\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing, the start generic my new second favourite after Guren no Yumiya (Shingeki no Kyojin), and punctuated by some kind of Japanese Raeggae-style music that sounds amazingly well with the action scenes.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nGreat plot ideas and scenario development, though I really wish we'd gotten a bitmore of an insight into Bishamon and Yato's story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nAmazing graphics, diverse and appropriate at all times.

            "content": "This is really something special. My eyes were glued to the screen. This is a quirky yet visually stunning anime. It starts off more light hearted and fun with some dark undertones and then totally flipped 180 and got serious with cute moments dispersed in there. This anime is unique in that it weaves together extremely nonchalant moments of comedy in between scenes which are action packed and tension filled. It does an excellent job at blending these two aspects which is why it shall be ranked up there on the list of my favourite anime.\r\nSo the plot follows Yato, a forgotten God who waslistening to people\u2019s wishes and running seemingly trivial errands for humans with the dream of one day becoming famous enough to have his own shrine filled with his own batch of Regalia (spirits which can act as weapons for the Gods). When on one of his errands, he is saved by the high school girl Hiyori and Yato and Hiyori\u2019s lives merge in an unbreakable way. Capturing/befriending the Regalia Yukine, a lost, young teenager, the three set out on their adventures to rid the world of phantoms (supernatural beings which are the cause of human misery, greed, jealousy and the like) and together work on increasing Yato\u2019s path to stardom.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really enjoyed about this anime was that there were three major plot complications which felt like the just right amount for the allocated 12 episodes of this season. The first one involved Yukine working out some issues of teenage angst and yearning for his life as a human which I found was a really nice addition to introduce Yukine\u2019s character and also how after he overcame these feelings of frustration, the Yukine-Yato-Hiyori group felt closer than ever.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the Yukine-Yato-Hiyori bunch, this anime has found a way to create the most incredible bonds between these characters as it genuinely feels like they are a family with Yato being the protective and patient father, Hiyori being the loving mother and Yukine being the kid that acts out and is going through his hormonal phase hahaha. The scene in which this really felt accurate was when Yukine was back to being a good kid and was doing the chores and was wanting to study with Hiyori\u2019s old school books and Yato and Hiyori\u2019s were so happy and proud that they started crying tears of happiness like real parents would. It was amazing. Really though, you cannot go wrong with this trio and they made me really invested in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe second climax point involves a tussle with another God wanting vengeance which reveals the darker side of Yato\u2019s personality. This is also another great climactic inclusion as it really fleshes out Yato\u2019s character and makes you question how he could change so much and adopt such a adorable and cringe-laughter worthy personality which he has now. For curiosity inducing purposes, it does a great job.\\n\\n\r\nThe final twist in the show tugs on your heartstrings as it is totally bittersweet. The connection between the group is put to the test and strengthened. This anime also avoids the clich\u00e9 in which the guy distances himself to protect the girl which has become totally eye-worthy so I was really won over by this one. The connection between Yato and Hiyori is also put to the test specifically and highlighted just how much they meant to each other. It also included some totally gush-worthy scenes that could totally be interpreted as romantic!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is clean and stunning during battle scenes and shifts perfectly as the show switches between dark and light-hearted. The eyes of the characters are what really caught my attention\u2026see for yourself:\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters also hold their own, with the villains feeling appropriately fear-worthy and the accomplices feeling as fleshed out as the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately I am absolutely glad that I took the time to watch this anime and am most definitely going to go on to read the manga and go on to the second season! This anime which feels like a strange but amazing merge between Kamisama Hajimemashita and Inuyasha is definitely highly recommended!!",

I feel to much things in the plot are stolen from the very famous anime BLEACH ... when we go on the story we find so much things alike such as fighting with swords which are actually real people .. these phantoms and those hollows .. and much more that I cant say because I'll spoil bleach if I do .. so the story deserved 7/10 \r\nTheart of the anime is just wonderful ... the drawings were perfect in my point of view ... the characters and all were perfect .. it deserves 10/10 absoultly \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nfor the sounds of the anime :- \\n\r\nThe opening :10/10\\n\r\nThe OSTs in the anime were very good and different from any other anime .. it deserved 9/10 \\n\r\nThe ending is something that no one cares about but still it deserves 8/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the anime were different and good ... but they weren't the perfect characters to an anime .. there is very good characters that I really liked such as The guy called Rabu ... while i really hated the gut called Yukine in the beginning .. but he was fine to me at the end of the anime ... characters get 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nFor the enjoyment .... I think I pretty enjoyed the anime ... the beginning was a little bit slow ... but I liked the comedy of it ... and then as we moved on to the serious part it was amazing ... 9/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nfor the ENDIND of the anime ... I will start to spoil now so if you didn't watch the anime you can leave now \\n\\n\\n\r\nthe final episode of the anime ws about the fight between Yato and Rabu ... I really enjoyed the fight but it's ending was not satisfying to me ... you know .. the unrealistic way of how hiyori returns her memory ... and the unrealistic way of how yato beats rabu .. I think it deserves 8/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nand for that the overall is 9/10 \\n",

The story is lacking in that it does not have a proper conclusion and has already finished airing.  However, the part of the story that it does include is entertaining enough to hold my attention until the end.  The art style of Noragami is one of its more impressive aspects and because of this,  the action sequences are always something to look forward to.  The music in the show never stood out to me, but it was not bad by any means, and the themesong is an aggressive and playful intro to an aggressive and playful anime.  All of the characters in Noragami are either interesting because of who they are or because of the way they look, and there are definitely some killer character designs here.  I really did enjoy the time I spent with this show and although the story is not very complex and lacks a satisfactory ending, the charming and intriguing characters and art style won me over.",

            "content": "I would definitely say watch this if you want to be convicted. Apparently, I did. I was looking for something that would leave me thinking about something (even after all the spontaneous laughter). This is one where I rated it pretty high for one great detail that left me heart-broken (in a good way). I have not read it before, so whether or not it follows close to the manga is not for me to say. For what it represents, it is fairly solid. It is pretty visually appealing too--a lot of the characters have those beautiful shiny eyes. *___* Some character development is surprising,especially Yukine's story, I might add. In fact, it pretty much made up my mind about how much I wound up enjoying the show. It was particularly found in one episode, but it's significant to me. If there's one thing you can take from this, the most important thing I took from it, this is it:\\n\r\nRepentance is a heavy matter. It's greater than any typical disappointment we may face. Ignoring it will only make it worse. Anyone who believes that sin exists will agree. Every day, we are disappointing someone or something greater than ourselves even when we don't realize it. Chances to change are around every corner, but we have to turn there ourselves. Though we might have greater convictions telling us to turn, we're the ones who can turn ourselves. It's a chance to be humbled and to discover something greater than mortal life itself. After all, there's a difference between living for an appointed time and the chance to live eternally with Someone. I am sure I am causing Someone's heart to break everyday, and I need to tell Him when I do wrong. Nonetheless, He is always bearing something for me, and I cannot forget that. This incident (as you will see) was a great reminder of that. It is right that I weep when I do wrong and to beg that forgiveness. \\n\r\nIt was touching that an anime show could remind me of this.",

My only complaint is that I didn't get to see his background very much or an explanation of why he has changed, buthopefully there will be a second season.\\n\\n\r\nYukine...is irritating.  But, I suppose it was only for a few episodes and before and after that he is tolerable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are interesting, especially Kofuku and her man.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty unique and I never got bored with it.  It seemed more about the characters, their relationships, the look, the comedy, more than the actual plot to be honest.  But I was totally fine with that.  It kind of has this devil is part timer vibe to it?  But it's way better than that show.   Maybe like, Devil is a part timer crossed with Durarara.  \\n\\n\r\nThe OST is really, really good and the animation is terrific.  The fight scenes were really good and there weren't too many of them which kept them interesting.  \\n\\n\r\nIt has AMAZING VA's in it.  You could watch it just for that.  Every time a new character came in it was another awesome VA.\\n\\n\r\nI was really feeling for the characters the whole way through.  I was laughing a lot.  And even though it did feel rushed toward the end, I didn't really mind.  It is a very, sort of eccentric show.  The way the characters interact and things they do are very unexpected and catch you off guard.  That was very refreshing since a lot of anime can be very cliched and predictable.  \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this!  It is pure entertainment with a heart and brain.",

            "content": "Noragami really took me by surprise this season. I figured it wouldn't be much, considering no one seems to talk about it, but upon watching the first episode I was hooked. It's a show that offers a lot, with an interesting premise and complex characters that combine to form an enjoyable experience.\r\nSOUND: 10/10\r\n I'll review the aspects of Noragami in order of my impression and procession of them as I go along. That being said, goddamn this show has some great music. I currently have both the OP and ED on my personal music player, a position held exclusively with Noragami because music in animeseldom stands out to me. The rest of the OVA doesn't shy away from that level of quality, either. Many of the intense scenes are matched with energetic electronic music, with vocals that reinforce the theme of gods and the other-worldly. I enjoyed the cast of voice actors as well, especially Yato.\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\r\nNoragami has a really cool art style going for it. Its use of vibrant colors and radiant shading schemes complemented the atmosphere of the show at many key points, and the animation is stellar in key scenes, while never really falling below consistent otherwise.\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters of Noragami are what make the show so fun to watch for me. Yato makes for a really interesting character. He can go from stern and serious to silly and playful in a way that isn't jolty, and still supports an overarching personality. Yukine doesn't start off very favorably, but his light shines later in the story. I did feel as though Hiyori was more of a support character than anything; one that exists more to enhance the character of others rather than have an equally established story of her own. She seems to pull through at the end, but everything is over before her chance to grasp at any complexity, as it would seem.\\n\r\nSTORY: 6/10\\n\r\nThis is where Noragami starts to take a bit of a dive, I feel. The show offers such a rich atmosphere, with so much potential for growth and extrapolation and development... aaand, then you see the episode count. Twelve episodes was not enough for this show. That starts to show near the end, where the introduction/conflict/resolution process accelerates. Things happen so quickly, and certain plot points are resolved before they really have time to be impactful. Noragami, in my opinion, has more than enough energy and passion, to have been a 24 episode series, but for whatever reason it was cut down to 12. If a second season were made it could flesh out some more-or-less forgotten characters, close loose ends and help things overall, but as it stands this is the glaring weakness of Noragami, in my opinion.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\r\nDespite that, though, I still really enjoyed Noragami. Its premise is unique, and it matches its exciting fight sequences with really emotional scenes so that many people can get something out of it.\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\r\nIt really is a shame that this show was only 12 episodes long, because it isn't even necessarily the show itself that's to blame, just the fact that, for whatever reason, it wasn't able to get the >20 episodes it deserved. I hate that such a thing has to knock a point or two off my final score of the show, but I don't have anything more to work with. Regardless, it's still a great show, with a superb audio-visual style, interesting characters and an intriguing universe in general.\\n\\n\r\nSeason two, maybe?",

            "content": "Noragami is a kind of UFO in the animation world. Let me explain this thoroughly through my review.\r\nFirst of all, the story is slow in taking place. Without saying any spoil, they throw out an incongruous situation out of nowhere, and build a story around it. This is without a doubt a comedy, but can you mindfreely make any jokes when you need to describe meanwhile an impossible fantasy situation from the very beginning? We are not immersed, the effect is absolutely the opposite.\r\nMoreover, there are too many flaws in the story, they are building up a relation ship with the main protagonists the morethe time goes by, and this is the only red link that we got, the knowledge that at the end of the episode, their friendship will be strengthened. \\n\\n\r\nThe end of the story... is not memorable. It is the logical conjecture of every episodes we followed on. In one word, they are flooding the viewer with the magical ' Power of Friendship ' u_u\" .\\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay, overall it is a good anime to waste your spare time, the end is dynamic. The beginning is a little boring. The graphism are very good, the opening is great, and is the reason for which I began Noragami (most of the time, when the op is great, the anime follows :p).\\n\\n\r\nI said a lot of bad things on Noragami, but that's what it is. Here's what I liked otherwise: Going through the first episodes, we are bored less and less, because the incogruosity is more enormous, there are questions, questions that we wished to be answered (and unfortunately, they aren't), and thus we wish to know what's next, and this situation is cool.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Noragami is a UFO for the only reason of that, even now and from the very beginning, I don't know what end and what meaning the authors want to give it.\\n\\n\r\nI read another review of Noragami. Contrarily to what he says, Noragami hasn't any philosophical sense at all, this is bullshit. They were talking about suicide due to mysterious creatures, but there's no philosophy in it, nothing.\\n\\n\r\nOne final word, watch it if you wish to spend a good time, but don't think it to be the anime of the decade.",

In a certain way it reminds of Heracles and the twelve labors he performed, the difference existing in the fact that he did not wish for notoriety.\r\nThe course of action takenby Yato eventually comes down to meeting Hiyori, a normal girl thrown into a world of mystery, conflict and suffering as she gets to know Yato better.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is a well made combination of vivid colors,edges and shapes with the style focusing mostly on art rather than a regular approach which is rather appealing given the genre of this series.\\n\r\nBoth the backgrounds and the character templates were rather constant allowing me to focus mostly on the story rather than the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are designed in order to suit the aims of the producers, they wear normal outfits have or will have dark thoughts mainly seen through their eyes and in all acting according to a certain template. Personally, I felt that the antagonists needed more to their story than their personal vendettas since the talk is nothing more than a mere exchange of words and the displaying of the past.\\n\\n\r\nI overally enjoyed the series because of the wellmade animations as well as the flow of emotions coming from each character when faced with his/her own problems as well as the ever-present comedy scenes which some of us love and others hate.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a good time watching a series with a potentially good story then I would recommend Noragami. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for the time taken to read this review.\\n\\n",

There's just a need of additional flavorings to make the characters' build-up a masterpiece of some sort.\r\nEnjoyment:\r\nThe non-stop funny punchlines and comedic stuntsof the characters would never fail you in this department. I honestly think that among all the other elements of this anime, the comedy must stay, or else--this would be nothing.

            "content": "I love 12-episode animes that makes you ask \"it's over already?\" upon completion.  That says two things: it was well-paced, and thoroughly entertaining.  Noragami  is both, and stands as one the best anime to debut in 2014.\r\nThe world in which Noragami inhabits is artfully crafted and full of intrigue.  The conceit isn't original -- supernatural beings battling fiends in a realm invisible to the naked eye -- but it works in part to the clean execution, likable characters, and various themes it explores.  In Noragami, the world is split into two realms: the Near Shore - the land of theliving, and the Far Shore - the land of the dead.  Gods and their spiritually-infused weapons called Regalia wage war against emotional clusters called phantoms, while at the same time granting the wishes of those in the Near Shore.  The main characters are Yato, a lesser-known god; Yukine, his unsullied regalia; and Hiyori, a school girl/half-phantom that finds herself trapped between both realms  as a result of an accident she had while trying to save Yato.\\n\\n\r\nYukine and Hiyori are more or less stuck with Yato; Yukine's stuck because he's Yato's regalia, and Hiyori's stuck because Yato is dragging his feet curing her condition.  They have a tumultuous relationship with Yato at first, but gradually they begin to coalescence creating a tight-knit and lovable trio.  The chemistry between those three is one of the highlights of the anime.  The way they interact with each other can be funny, upsetting, and poignant.  The banter and dialogue is witty, and often echoes what the viewer is thinking (speaking for myself).  And while an underdeveloped romance/attraction has been hinted between Yato and Hiyori, it isn't needed to fully appreciated the bond they formed, Yukine included.\\n\\n\r\nHiyori acts as the tether that grounds both Yato and Yukine.  Ever since her attempt to save Yato, she's developed a condition where she falls asleep and awakens in spirit form -- hence her existence as a half-phantom.  As a half-phantom, she can see gods and phantoms in addition to obtaining some enhanced physical abilities.  Hiyori isn't in the same league as the gods, but she quickly adapts to her condition by applying her love for wrestling in battles.  This allows her to be more than just a spectator/damsel-in-distress.  And while she still requires assistance from Yato, it's only because she's outclassed, not because she lacks resolve.  Speaking of Yato, both him and Hiyori have strong moral values that complement each other.\\n\\n\r\nWe first meet Yato after he accepts the wish of a socially troubled high schooler.  Then without breaking a sweat, he kills the phantom tormenting her.  It's clear Yato's experienced at what he does, but his appearance says different.  He wears a casual jumpsuit (jersey) that's topped off with a tattered scarf.  Very much in contrast to his former Regalia, Tomone, who belittles him for having sweaty hands, and lacking the regality befitting someone calling himself a god.  And make no mistake, Yato is a god, but a forgotten one, who's trying to rebuild his reputation.\\n\\n\r\nHe has grand designs for a luxurious shrine equipped with adoring shrine maidens.   But due to his low-profile existence, he's forced to take on menial tasks that pay a measly 5 Yen.  However, you'll hear no complaints from him; Yato is humble and more than happy to take any job that inches him closer to becoming a grand deity.  Yato is by no means perfect, but during the series you'll learn a lot about him and his origins.  In the past he was a force to be reckoned with, destroying any and everything in his path.  Now, he's a delivery god that no one's ever heard of, or -- if they have -- don't take seriously enough to use him for anything more than slight inconveniences.  He's laidback and disheveled, yet possesses a work ethic that's completely void of bitterness.  But his appearance and stature, as compared to the other gods, annoys the living hell out of Yukine.\\n\\n\r\nYukine probably develops the most out of any character.  He's inexperienced as a regalia,  spending most of the anime coming to grips with the fact that he's dead and can't enjoy life like his living contemporaries.  His struggles are relatable, and no matter how much he comes off as petulant, you can't help but to feel sympathy towards him.  His arc from reluctant regalia to loyal companion is filled with powerful, though-provoking moments dealing with themes of envy, solitude, and atonement.  Yato and Hiyori support Yukine through his trials as if they're his older siblings, and that makes their relationship with him feel earned.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters aside from Yato, Hiyori, and Yukine that leave a favorable impression.  You have Kofuku, the manic pixie dream god of poverty, who hurts more than she helps.  Nora, the \"slut\" of regalias, who technically belongs to multiple gods and manipulates events from the shadows.  And then there's Bishamon, the god of war, who possesses an army of talented regalias.  However, Bishamon particularly sticks out, but that's only in terms of her appearance.  She's the god of war, yet goes into battle dressed like Poison from Final Fight.  And what we know about Bishamon doesn't lead us to believe she'd wear such an ill-fitting outfit to battle.  With that said, they don't use her appearance to facilitate any fanservice (a plus), but unused sex appeal notwithstanding, it's incongruent with her personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters -- notably the main three -- are, as mentioned, one of the highlights of the anime.  The other noteworthy aspect of Noragami is its animation.  The battles are short but easy to follow.  Characters display nice, fluid moves when attacking, and when phantoms are killed, their flashy death animation is evocative of the end of a JRPG battle.  Though it bears mentioning that Yato's pre-finisher battle quote can get repetitive.  Elaborating a little more on the phantoms, clusters are usually represented by disembodied eyes, but individual phantoms are depicted with a surreal translucence.  Furthermore, their inaudible whispers occasionally add an element of horror to the anime.  Altogether Noragami contains some slick visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest criticism of Noragami is that it waits until 3/4 into the series to introduce the main protagonist, leaving the history between him and Yato incomplete.  Still, Noragami rightly wraps up the villain's arc, and leaves unanswered questions for a potential second season to address.  Overall, Noragami emerges as one of the biggest surprises this season with its cool battles, equal balance between drama and moments of levity, and clean aesthetic.  But the selling point is undoubtedly the chemistry between the main trio.",

            "content": "If you\u2019ve ever been unemployed, you\u2019ve got some idea of what Yato is going through.  Nobody respects him, nobody believes in him, and nobody wants to hire him.  On top of all that, the one person he has by his side in life has just left him, citing his constant failures on both personal and professional levels as her grounds for doing so.  Now that he\u2019s all alone and struggling to scrape by, he\u2019ll have to set aside his dignity and take every single job that comes his way, whether he\u2019s qualified to complete them or not...  We\u2019ve all been thereat some point, but where Yato\u2019s experiences differ from ours is that for each job, he can only accept about five hundred yen in payment...  Because he\u2019s an aspiring Japanese God.\\n\\n\r\nJust when it seems like he\u2019d be forever alone on his journey, his life takes a sudden turn with the introduction of two people he may have just been fated to meet...  Hiyori, a high school girl who somehow obtains the powers of astral projection when she attempts to save Yato\u2019s life, and Yukine, the resurrected spirit of a long-dead teenage boy.  Their lives quickly become intertwined with his as the sins of his past start to take notice and haunt him once more.  Can these three kindred spirits get along with each other long enough to help Yato realize his ambitions in the spiritual hierarchy, or will simply surviving turn out to be a tough enough challenge on it\u2019s own?\\n\\n\r\nNoragami was animated by the once famous Studio Bones, and while it\u2019s not their best looking work, it\u2019s probably their best looking recent work.  There is a budget disparity, because this is Bones and there\u2019s always a budget disparity, but it's relatively well managed.  While there is a good chunk of action throughout the story, it\u2019s also a very dialogue heavy series full of character-banter and exposition.  The budget gets cut during these scenes, which is generally the ideal way to go about it unnoticed.  In exchange for this, the action scenes have a great flow to them, the comedic scenes can use just enough movement to give them the energy they need, and guys, the spirits that Yato and his friends have to fight are just resplendent.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are simple and a little on the generic side, utilizing templates that you\u2019ve no doubt seen in many modern anime.  They do their job well enough, but the only thing that sets them apart from the norm are a few unique touches that were added to their outfits and the attractive design of their eyes.  That\u2019s not to say they\u2019re bland looking in any way, but there isn\u2019t much visual flare to any of them.  The backgrounds and environments are highly detailed and richly colored, but in keeping to form with the character designs, this is nothing you haven\u2019t seen before.  The exception to this is in their highly expressive faces, which are versatile enough on their own to distract you from the few times that a key frames lingers on screen for a few seconds too long.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, on the other hand, is a lot more original and inspired.  I didn\u2019t notice it for the most part...  Not because it wasn\u2019t there, but because it was doing it\u2019s job well...  But the few tracks I did notice were the kind that I\u2019d have no problem playing in my car, thanks to the diverse compositions of Taku Iwasaki.  Most of the show\u2019s more noticeable tunes are blends of rock and traditional Japanese music with contemporary styles like drum and base and techno, creating a unique sound that helps to elevate the series beyond the general aimlessness of it\u2019s story.  Blood pumping music makes for good action, and a good beat is essential for making it work.  The beat on most of these tracks tracks is so good that you may catch yourself nodding your head and tapping your foot in time with it.  \\n\\n\r\nEven outside of the opening and closing, there\u2019s a surprising amount of vocal work in the background music.  There\u2019s rapping in these songs...  Yes, it surprised me too, not just by how good it sounds but the fact that it\u2019s there at all.  Straight up rapping, and if that\u2019s not unusual enough, there are also a lot of instances...  Especially in the tune Noratan...  That use vocals as if a person were shouting random sounds into a megaphone rather than singing them, and it all comes together really well.  This is a series that blends classic Japanese mythology with modern styles and attitudes, and while it\u2019s nowhere near the first anime to do this, it is the only one I can think of that used an equally anachronistic music style, and it fits the series perfectly.  The opening, Goya no Machiawase by Hello Sleepwalkers, is a little more standard than the rest of the soundtrack, but it\u2019s still on the high end of the scale.   It\u2019s a soundtrack that shines with effort and inspiration over-all, and it sounds just as good whether out of context or in context.\\n\\n\r\nThe recently released English dub was a Funimation endeavor, and with the Japanese being such a solid blend of comedy and drama, they had quite a bit to live up to...  But Funimation has proven themselves before, and with Bonny Clinkenbeard behind the wheel, they prove it once again.  Brynn Appril plays the lead role of Hiyori, the quirky high-schooler who gets caught up in this whole mess, and boy does her voice get a work-out.  Between having to scream whenever her character over-reacts to something(which is a thing that happens a lot) and lecturing her new friend over his behavior, or just singing to herself over her new-found powers, she never recites a single line without amping up the emotion behind it.  She's the cornerstone of the chemistry that these three possess, and Brynn does a great job upholding it.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, neither do her costars, Jason Leibricht and Micah Solusod.  Their performances are just as animated as hers, if not moreso during their stronger moments.  As the down-on-his luck Yato, Liebricht really does sound like a guy holding onto hope and trying to enjoy his life despite the huge weight hanging over him, and the dark past that he\u2019s supposedly put behind him.  Micah Solusad goes on more of a journey than the other two, following the spirit Yukine as he tries to make do with his situation, although never shying away from openly criticizing the boss he\u2019s been saddled with.  He keeps it together, but it\u2019s clearly a struggle, and...  As they say...  Something\u2019s gotta give, and when it does, he breaks through as the star of this dub.  Alexis Tipton as Kofuku is...  Alexis Tipton.  Which is a good thing.  \\n\\n\r\nNoragami gets off to a great start.  It introduces us to a very interesting universe and a strong premise revolving around the ambitious but heavily flawed Yato, and his two friends who are just likable as he is, and through them, we get to explore the intricacies of this spiritual society existing just out of reach of normal human acknowledgement.  There\u2019s a lot of potential in these early episodes, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of people say that it sort of drops the ball after that point.  In a way, I\u2019m inclined to agree, as once everything\u2019s laid out on the table, well, Noragami does lose start to show some cracks.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, it kind of can\u2019t be ignored...  This series is based heavily on Japanese mythology, and it makes the mistake of assuming the viewer is familiar with that kind of material.  A lot of the details of it\u2019s universe are mentioned without any explanation or build-up, and while those in the know will be able to understand the context of those details enough to not question how it works, most American viewers will likely treat each piece of it with a raised eyebrow and, at best, an \u201cif you say so...\u201d kind of response.  \\n\\n\r\nSee, in order to do his job, Yato needs the aid of a shinki, or...  In the dub...  A Regalia.  He takes the spirit of Yukine as his regalia, and can turn him into a weapon whenever necessary (See Soul Eater for more on this concept).  For those of us who don\u2019t regularly study Japanese mythology, we\u2019ll hear something like \u201cA God will start to deteriorate if their regalia misbehaves, and their deterioration can be caught by other Gods like a flesh eating bacteria,\u201d and we\u2019d respond to this with a blank stare.  It fits together about as well as saying that \u2018once the human population reaches one million, the moon will blow us up.\u2019  Yeah, we\u2019re along for the ride, but it kind of wrecks the immersion of the experience.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the details are explained to us through Hiyori...  Which I\u2019m sad to say is her main job in the series...  But it rarely ever goes any deeper than just \u201cThis is how this works, don\u2019t worry about the logic of it.\u201d  You could say it\u2019s my fault for not being worldly enough to get it, but I\u2019ve always been a strong believer in accessibility.  You shouldn\u2019t have to study to understand what\u2019s going on in a story.  That\u2019s not to say an anime with rich cultural subtext shouldn\u2019t inspire people to seek out more information about said culture, but you should still be mindful of those who haven\u2019t or even won\u2019t.  I\u2019ve criticized much better shows than this one for their accessibility issues, and I won\u2019t be giving any quarter over it today.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the halfway point, the series loses it\u2019s sense of direction, as well as any interest it may have had in Yato\u2019s pursuit of higher godhood.  Concepts brought up during the first half are dropped entirely, enemies from his past reappear in the story out of nowhere...  Like, seriously, one of them just happens to show up because one of Hiyori\u2019s friends prays to him offhand at a shrine...  And the stakes drop rapidly to the point that the only thing Yato\u2019s really fighting for is the one thing that works the best in the series;  His friendship with Hiyori and Yukine.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of Hiyori, she\u2019s kind of a pitiful main character.  My plot summary focused mainly on Yato because he\u2019s a lot more interesting than she is, and she doesn\u2019t really become important to the plot until episode 10.  She\u2019s likable, and she gets a few laughs in the early episodes, but she\u2019s never really given an identity beyond that point, other than being the glue of their friendship.  While the idea of her leaving her body behind whenever she goes spirity comes off as funny at first, they do so little with it, and the fact that her lifeless body has been sitting out in public for extended periods of time is just swept under the rug.  She leaves her body outside in the rain for over a full episode, and when she gets it back, she doesn\u2019t have a cold or anything.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can understand people saying that the first half was a lot stronger than the second half, I would like to respectfully disagree.  I took issue with this series as early as the third episode, and found myself hating it throughout the fourth episode, and my feeling has a lot to do with it\u2019s attitude towards depression and suicide.  See, in the world of Noragami, people don\u2019t decide to commit suicide on their own...  A malicious spirit attaches itself to people who are experiencing negative emotions and pushes them towards expressing it through extreme methods. \\n\\n\r\nNow, an immediate defense for this might be \u201cIsn\u2019t that how the witches in Madoka Magika work?\u201d  Well, no. The witches in Madoka Magika use suicide as a weapon, but they attack indiscriminately against anybody in the area.  They\u2019re not the sole cause of suicide, they just utilize it.  In Noragami, Yato states twice in episode three alone that if a soul wants to kill itself, then it\u2019s being possessed.  Unless this is a translation error...  Which I doubt...  Noragami openly blames suicide(And murder, and even bullying) on spiritual possession.\\n\\n\r\nOn the one hand, you could say that possession is a metaphor for depression, that an undeniable force is taking control of you and urging you towards things you don\u2019t want to do.  And yeah, that metaphor kind of adds up, save for two serious problems.  First of all, it\u2019s a situation that can conveniently be solved by simply killing or exorcising the offending demon.  This throws the metaphor argument directly under the bus, as even if you\u2019re able to stop a depressed person from killing themselves, depression is not that easy to cure.  It\u2019s a complicated illness with countless possible catalysts, and to imply that they can all be erased by getting rid of that pesky negative feeling is just insulting.  This isn\u2019t a metaphor...  It\u2019s a Strawman.\\n\\n\r\nIn fiction, a Strawman is a person or entity to whom you attribute negative feelings or behaviors in order to dehumanize them and ultimately defeat them.  It\u2019s the equivalent of getting over an ex by placing your desire for them in a stuffed animal and tearing it to pieces.  A good example of this is Gatchaman Crowds, a series that\u2019s become infamous for using an evil villain as a Strawman for bullying and online harassment.  Japanese culture has a lot of Strawmen in it...  \u201cBreak the gate, bad feelings be gone\u201d and stuff like that...  But when you\u2019re dealing with serious issues, they deserve to be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami didn\u2019t set out to belittle a lot of peoples\u2019 real life problems...  I know that wasn\u2019t it\u2019s intention, and demonic possession isn\u2019t the worst way to explore it.  It\u2019s been done, and it\u2019s been done well.  The problem is that this show just doesn\u2019t show any evidence of understanding the topic it\u2019s dealing with.  For the perfect example, there\u2019s an extensive scene in episode 4 where Yato & Feiends are accidentally dialed by a man who\u2019s jumping off of a building.  Throughout what must be the longest fall in history(Seriously, you could do your taxes before hitting the ground), he tells them that he fell in love with a young woman and from then onwards, he had worse and worse luck resulting in his business failing and going bankrupt.  It\u2019s revealed that he was dating the goddess of poverty, so Yato severs his connection to said Goddess, saves him from the fall, and then...  Eureka, everything\u2019s resolved!\\n\\n\r\nExcept no, it\u2019s not.  They haven\u2019t solved his financial problems, nor have they rid him of the hard times and deep shame that clearly came with it, so there\u2019s no saying whether or not he\u2019ll try to die again.  Also, his cruel sociopath of a woman gets off easy just because she thought what she was doing to him was funny.  No, I\u2019m sorry, they haven\u2019t undone the damage that was done to him, and I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s never going to target anybody ever again.  And this is one of my biggest problems with Noragami...  By defeating these spirits, you\u2019re not helping anybody, you\u2019re just putting a band-aid on a wound that\u2019s going to reopen again, and you\u2019re just stopping there.  \u201cI don\u2019t care what you\u2019re going through, or how much you\u2019re suffering...  Just as long as you don\u2019t resort to any methods that\u2019ll make people sad!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I know this has some kind of ties to Japanese beliefs, but there\u2019s another Eastern belief that I\u2019d like apply to this;  If you save somebody\u2019s life, you\u2019re responsible for that life.  It\u2019s not Japanese, but it\u2019s still relevant.  Now that proverb may have many meanings, but in this case, I\u2019d like to use it as meaning that if you step in and prevent them from committing suicide, you\u2019ve become involved in their struggle.  You have just taken away their way out, and you\u2019d better be damn well ready to show them another way out, otherwise you\u2019re just pushing your belief on other people to preserve your own sensibilities.  In Noragami, the idea seems to be \u201cNope, you\u2019re not gonna die...  Good luck!\u201d  And to me, that seems just as irresponsible as not doing anything.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with all of these problems that I had with Noragami, is it a bad show?  Nope!  It\u2019s two strongest elements, thankfully. take up the majority of the series.  The first is the action, which...  While poorly set up through rushed villains...  Is freaking awesome, whether your brain\u2019s turned off or on.  The animation never really looks bad, but these fight scenes are where the budget shines through gloriously, and while the villains may have had writing issues, they\u2019re all a lot of fun.  They\u2019re well designed and intimidating, and they have compelling motives that are tied to Yato\u2019s dark past, which is a really smart way to grow him as a character...  By showing him literally battling against his past sins.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the second is the relationship between Yato and his Regalia, Yukine.  Their dynamic is very effective at holding up their separate yet still intertwined arcs.  Yato brought Yukine back to life in order to use him as a tool to help him get back on his feet and maybe even restore his long lost glory.  He thinks of him as an object, needing to follow orders and obey his beck and call.  Yukine hates this, and rebels almost immediately, acting out in ways that damage Yato.  Yato has to learn how to be fair and treat his Regalia like a person, and Yukine needs to learn to accept his fate and respect the one who gave him his second chance.  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a very parent/child sort of dynamic, and it works really well because nether character is fully in the wrong, and they\u2019re both acting in relatable, understandable ways.  We\u2019ve all been to that place where we resent somebody for disrespecting us and taking our generosity for granted.  We\u2019ve all been in places where we felt disgruntled over situations that were forced upon us without our consent, and yes, some dark part of us wanted to see other people suffer what we have to suffer.  It\u2019s a very well-developed conflict, and with Hiyori acting as the glue between them, we never have to wonder why Yukine doesn\u2019t just quit the way Yato's previous Regalia did.  In fact, I\u2019ll be perfectly honest, I liked the second half of this series more than the first half, simply because it spent so much time on these two aspects of the series that I enjoyed the most.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is available from Funimation.  At the time of this writing, you can find it on Amazon in the DVD/Bluray combo pack format for just over half of the original price.  You can also find it on Funimation.com and Amazon Instant Video, and the undubbed subtitled version is available on Netflix.  The original manga IS available stateside from Kodansha comics USA, and from what I\u2019ve heard, it tells a much more complete story than the series does.  A second season is scheduled to air in Japan in October, and from the summaries I\u2019ve read, it will be following the story of one of Yato\u2019s enemies, a blonde woman with an eyepatch named Bishamonten.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is a somewhat problematic show, suffering from issues on almost every level, but the product as a whole is worth more than the sum of it\u2019s parts.  If you\u2019re interested in Japanese mythology, then its world-building makes it out to be a decent introduction to the subject.  The inconsistency of the writing kind of works in it\u2019s favor, as it tends to give up on the things it\u2019s doing wrong and focuses most of it\u2019s time on the things it does right, for better or worse.  Personally, I did enjoy the good parts of it enough to watch it a second or maybe even third time in the future, although I\u2019ll probably be skipping episode four when I do so.  Combining that with some solid animation and the most interesting soundtrack I\u2019ve heard in years, I give Noragami a 6/10.",

The female protagonist is very strong but also very cute! Yato is a god but not undefeated like other anime in which the hero is unbeatable and can defeat almost everyone! I highly recommend this one! From the first episode it just shows the story and then the adventure begins! In other anime we have to wait for 2 or 3 episodes till we fully understand what is going on! Also we have an excellent character development. I literally cried from laughingso hard. It has epic laughing scenes and epic jokes and dialogues!",

            "content": "A decent world that while simple, is fairly charming.\r\nGods used divine instruments (they seem to be people that died, i think, i dont remember them being explained properly enough) to fight and exorcise evil spirits.\r\nThe story follows a minor god Yato in his quest to become a famous god with a big shrine and a lot of followers, but this premise just represents the feelings of Yato, not what the actual show is about.\r\nWe get instead how Yato starts searching and taking care of a new divine instrument and the problems that come with it.\r\nAfter a certain number of episodes there is a plot twistand we start getting less comedy scenes while the show gets more serious. While this is not a bad change in itself i was actually expecting to see more of the slice of life parts of this anime and how Yato was trying to become a famous god (Yato screen time is always golden) rather than a villain and a cliche that has been beaten to death appearing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise the show doesnt show what happens to Hiyori when she is in her spirit time. There is a few slight mentions of it but it feels like that happening all the time on all kinds of places has no repercussions at all. Well i guess that actually never matters (seriously what happens with her when she splits) and never bothers her as long as she can hang around Yato.\\n\r\nYato and Yukine are pretty well written and while i read a lot of criticism against Yukine i felt that his character and his role was completely on point.\\n\r\nI don't have criticism against any character but Hiyori. She seems to be important to the plot sometimes but she feels like a side character until the final episodes.\\n\r\nDespite my mixed feelings about the change of pace and Hiyori i definitely had a great time with this anime. There is also a second season that i'll go watch right away!",

            "content": "Noragami is one of my more recently watched anime, and it has to be one of my favourites. Sure, it's not perfect, but then again nothing is. \r\nThe story was well thought out, with essential plot points developed well and other filler parts executed excellently as well. I would like to have seen a bit more character history (especially for Yukine and Hiyori) but I suppose not everything can be covered properly in twelve episodes. I did love the little twists and turns every so often, further compelling me to watch even just a little more at any opportunity I could.\r\nI loved the animation andart style of Noragami, with battle scenes being amazingly animated although some features were reused repeatedly. Fluid animation is something I always look for when I start a new anime, and this certainly delivered.\\n\\n\r\nI was very impressed with the soundtrack, and the opening theme song I loved more than anything - in fact, it is now one of my most listened to songs on Spotify! I never felt that the music hindered the quality of the scenes; if anything, it only enhanced my watching experience. The music wasn't perfect, I'll admit that, but it was never completely wrong for the moment it was used in either.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here are some of my favourites, especially Yato, Yukine and Kazuma. They all experienced some tragedy which, through true strength of character, they finally overcame. I felt they were all superbly developed, with maybe only a few details missing from their histories and personal lives. Other characters, such as Hiyori, I loved as well, because they all interacted with each other in a believable way and their personalities never seemed to get in the way of the plot or anything major like that. Each and every character was amazing in their unique way.\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching this anime, I cannot say that I felt anything towards it other than love. Each aspect worked together to create something truly awesome. I sometimes see hate for it because of some minor thing that might not have been done too well, but it is hard to make everything perfect, and twelve episodes is quite a small time frame - look at other anime that have been running for years and have hundreds of episodes! Overall this anime was, in my opinion, close to perfect. Potentially the content does not appeal to everyone, but I don't think it is possible to completely hate Noragami. At the very least, the animation is something to appreciate, or even the soundtrack. This anime is one I will treasure forever.",

            "content": "With being both unique but in the same time a bit cheesy show, Noragami manages to approach a lot of stuff in a clever way while trying to portray its own story, loneliness and severe depression that drive people to consider suicide is a serious problem, especially nowadays, people tend to let go of their lives so easily with no deep consideration, thinking that they will find an escape in dying, but that's only after they forsake God, Noragami presents a world that has several gods, much like the ancient cultures, where you have for every aspect a God, for instance, God of health, Godsof war, and so on..., and it also goes deeper and focuses on even more common social phenomena like teenage rebellious behavior and what not. This is a dark tale, but with light-hearted comedy half of the time, but yet remains to be serious the other half, this is the telling about a long forgotten God!\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\\n\r\nYato, is the God of war that became to be forgotten in the modern world, seeing how people started having faith in science when dealing with war and conflict rather than praying to that one divine being that used to grant wicked wishes, and keep the blood flow going, which he is saving up a budget from doing several every-day tasks for 5-yen in order to build himself a shrine of his own, he gets to meet this very interesting girl, Iki Hyori who got herself involved with him unwillingly in a chain of events that changed her view on life.\\n\r\nAlong the way, Yato gets an acquaintance, a young boy who has yet to meet somebody who guides him the right way, rebellion can be really tough on both sides, but at the end, gentle words can patch up the deepest injuries of the heart.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (9.0/10):\\n\r\nAbsolutely stunning, In most modern anime shows, the quality of the animation tends to lower few episodes in, but that was not the case with Noragami. With this series, I got to see some of the best drawn male figures to date, I mean, take the protagonists, Yato's eyes are just beautiful and so wonderful to look at, so blue they can distract you from the action going on display.\\n\r\nThe animation was fluid, almost flawless, never noticeable sluggish or lazy, and let's not forget about the backgrounds, the details are just on point, all the lighting and shadows, ugh, just perfect.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\\n\r\nI could go all day praising the wonderful opening and end them songs, probably the most thing I'm going to miss after finishing this up.\\n\r\nthe protagonist's voice actor, is the astonishing Kamiya Hiroshi, who also voices the beloved (Levi in Attack on Titan) and (Law in One Piece) and many other popular characters is doing a fine job with this role, balancing between the serious voice tone and carefree comedic tones amazingly, the soundtrack was okay for the most part.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\\n\r\nThe character rooster here is not that big, but remains very consistent to the storytelling, Yato is just greatness over greatness for a protagonist, I don't think I've ever complained or disliked his decisions, so smooth and easy going, a very likable and mysteriously interesting character with a lot for him to say than appears on the surface.\\n\r\nThere are other annoying characters too, but they are upon improvement later on, which is a payoff in itself.\\n\r\nAside from the main cast, the side characters are also rich and intriguing too, it gets you begging for more screen time for them.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this watch, I was brought here because of a random encounter with the series's opening theme song, but the story and characters were what kept me hooked till the end, I even got to finish this in 3 days, with is rarely ever to happen for me lately, I know it's too much for a 12 episodes long series, but for my tight schedule, I had to postpone some more important stuff just to follow along this.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (8.7/10):\\n\r\nI would totally recommend this series, at least for now, I know I have a new trump card in my disposal when discussing anime series with friends, the series while having some minor fanservice, and I repeat, very minor, it's safe to watch it with friends and family.",

            "content": "Ok, so lets talk little about Noragami. For starters I can say that i really ejoyed the show. For you out there whom really liked shows like Bleach, FMA or D-Grayman this i the show for you. Noragami concist a lot of the same elements as these shows withhout feeling like a ripoff. So lets get down to the reasons why I enjoyed the show so much. Hopefully i manage to do so without any spoilers. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe things I appreciated with Noragami where the balaced mix of comedy, action and more serious moments. The plot isnt super fast pacing but I appreicate that theydidnt rush the plot so it has time to get some depth. To be just a twelve episode show, Noragami have the content that makes it feel much longer than that. And have in mind that this show has a sequel and a third season is  likley to be seen, so the end can appear cut in the middle of a story (which it kinda is). I cant really go in to why I truly enjoyed the story without any spoilers, but if you watch you will know why (or mayby not). \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the art. I think the art and animation is original in its own way with its coloration and clean lines. I enjoyed how they had taken the time to give each character ther own peronal featers, even less important characters. The characters is nicely drawn and there are some nicly designed backgrounds. The action scences very well exicuted with fluid motions and nice angles. Like in most animes there are som smaller flaws like there feet looks really small inte a zoom out scene but overall the art is great!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nFirst of all I need to say that I loved the opening song. It really gets you in the right set of mood and I think it reflects the show very well. I feel like listening to it at least once a day, even after finishing the show. The music dominating the show is rock for the more action oriented scences and more classic music with flutes in more emotional moments. I think they  matched the music and the scences well. My only reason for an 8 is that even due i liked most of the music some songs wasnt just for me. Thats a peronal opinion, so you may think its great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters is way I love this show so much and giving it a 10. Even if we have the not so original male male female trinity MCs so are the characters the more unique and complex. They all have wishes and dreams, fears and dispairs. My personal favrouite is Yato, whom you first may disgard as a good for nothing goffball but has a lot more depth to him. And Hiyori isnt your mainstream type av MC girl ethier, it was refreshing to see her in this show. I really enjoyed to follow both their relationship and personal developments. The side characters doesnt feels like side characters at all, so much peronality has been put in to them. They add to the story nicely and thet all have functions to fill. Overall I enjoyed the characters and the dynamic between them very much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThen all the above is put together, then we have Noragami for me. I enjoyed every second of this show. I watched the dubbed version and I really liked the vocie actors, they put up a good preformance. If you have wtached your fair share of dubbed anime you will probaly recognize some of them. A great opening to set you in the right mood, you bounce right down in to the story, nice colors and character designs, a intresting but not overcomplicated story and a bit of romance, so for me its more like a question of what NOT to enjoy?\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nIm not gonna motivate my 10 any more then I all ready have, so I gonna keep it short. Noragami is one of those shows which makes me wanna start to read the manga as soon as I have watched the last episode. I cant simpley wait for the next season. Great show, I realley hope for a third season soon, Noragami really present it self well as an anime.\\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoy the show as much as I did! \\n",

            "content": "Personal Rate: 8\r\nOverall Rate based on the different criteria: 7,6 rounded up to 8\r\nAt first glance, Noragami is a mix between Soul Eater and Ao no Exorcist\u2026 which didn\u2019t bode well  as far as I was concerned since I hate the former with a vengeance and have slowly but surely fallen out of love with the latter\u2026 Not being familiar with the manga itself though, I\u2019ve been able to watch this show without expectations. So far so good\u00a0: Nothing new under the sun but still a pleasant ride.\r\nStory: 7\r\nArt: 8\r\nSound: 7\r\nCharacter: 7\r\nEnjoyment: 9\r\nOverall: 8\r\nStory\u00a0: 7\r\nUnlike many 12 episodes shows I\u2019ve watched recently which tendto want to pack too much in too small a space, Noragami takes the opposite approach. I found the leisurely pace just right though it might not appeal to everyone. It\u2019s very obvious this series is just an introduction as we don\u2019t really go into the meat of the story. Most of the series consists of portraying the newly established relation between our three mains which given the length was just right for me\u2026 but arguably doesn\u2019t add much in terms of plot progression.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\u00a0: 8\\n\\n\r\nLove the art full of details and bright colors though again I\u2019m forced to say Yato\u2019s character design is strangely reminiscent of Rin in Ao no Exorcist. Black hair, haircut almost the same, blue eyes and catlike face when he acts like an idiot. Apart from that, the animation is fluid though for a shounen I was surprised by how not that much care has been put in the choreography of the action scenes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\u00a0: 7\\n\\n\r\nThumbs up for the opening and ending. The rest is totally lost on me to be honest. Nothing that really stuck to mind EXCEPT that awful auto-tune theme you hear in fight scenes. Admittedly, we don\u2019t hear that ear-splitting auto-tune enough for it to make my ears bleed so I can\u2019t remove points for it but I needed to mention it. DIE AUTO-TUNE DIE.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nNothing remarkable about any of them to be honest. So I give a 7 because I liked them all overall but  since the series is taking it slow there\u2019s not a lot to say about any of them. Bishamon is here to fill the boob quota but  I was \u00ab\u00a0pleased\u00a0\u00bb to see that even her BDSM outfit is supposed to be a \u00ab\u00a0war\u00a0\u00bb weapon and that her normal clothes are more serious and military looking.\\n\\n\r\nYato and Yukine\u2019s bickering never last too long which could have been tiring and the same can be said about Yato and Hiyori whose relation is really sweet. I\u2019m totally onboard their ship, they\u2019re just too cute together.\\n\\n\r\nWe get the usual cute airhead in the character of Kofuku but she\u2019s not given enough screentime to make me want to break my screen so points to that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\u00a0: 9\\n\\n\r\nBinged it. Frankly I was not really that curious to know what was going to happen because as I typed above, the story is slow going but it didn\u2019t bother me because I enjoyed watching Yukine, Yato and Hiyori. It felt more like watching some kind of slice of life with a fantastic bent to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\u00a0: 8\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure I can recommend it to anyone\u2026 It\u2019s a bit of a hit or miss. It\u2019s very obvious the anime just scratches the surface of the manga but it might not work to make people invested. For a shounen that from the first episode promises action\u2026 people might be let down because action\u2026 is not really what you get. Sure there\u2019s a couple of fight scenes but they\u2019re far in between and usually end up quickly even the last fight in episode 12 is subpar. Watch it for the characters\u2019 interactions which for once don\u2019t contain boob jokes and moe girls. Just for that, it gets my seal of approval. For the rest, I\u2019ll see how the second season fares\u2026 but I\u2019m not expecting much plotwise\u2026 The anime doesn\u2019t even cover a 5th of the manga.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

What I mean by distorted spirits is normal human who\u2019s spirit has been came out of there body but there body is still find. Once your in spirit form your spirit leaves your body which once that happen you can not interact with anything in the real world only the spirit reality. Regalias are spirits that weapons used by gods that are very hard to find attimes to tame and could range from being a useless to very useless full. These weapons are used to defeat the Phantoms which are created from spirits that have gone bad.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBrief plot overview:\\n\\n\r\nThis happens to the a young middle school student named Iki, Hiyori once she has a fated encounter with Yato a god right before she pushed him out of the way of a bus in heavy traffic. Even though like one she gotten hit by the bus she didn\u2019t and did at the same time. The second Hiyori seen Yato about to get hit by the bus and Yato was already running across the street she spirit left her body to go save him even though the bus would have went throw them in spirit form. This lead to Hiyori ending up in the hospital. After she had left her body that first time she started to gain a bad habit of her soul leaving from her body out more to find out more about this god Yato that she bumped into. After finding out that she can\u2019t really control when she leaves her body or not she seeks help from Yato trying to solve this problem she is having. \\n\\n\r\n[Brief Characters overview]: \\n\r\nThe main characters are all very relatable and have great personalities. Yato is lovable guy and jokes around a lot. He is a amazing guy that cares for others even though he may seem to never be serious sometimes. Hiyori is one of the roles best acted from her voice acting performance to the animation and emotion Uchida, Maayaand puts into her character makes the show overall perfect. Yukine is lazy a bit and is a character that learns from his little mistakes for being a Regalia for Yato but that makes him enjoy him more throw out the show. \\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nStudio bones did a great job making the animation/art really unique and new to are eyes by not looking like a different style from what they have done in the past. To me the closest thing i could compare the animation to is like they combined Soul Eaters animation with a style of Durarara animation. The animation also\\n\\n\r\n[Music]: The opening is THE BEST OPENING i have ever seen its so well put together opening and thats how I got into this anime I had seen the opening in a top 10 and could stop watching it and ended up loving the opening and the show even more. The OST is amazing especially during the fight scenes its perfect tone will gets you hyped as if u were there. Also the build up for some of the OST songs is great.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nNoragami is a show that i enjoyed to watch an didn\u2019t expect it to be as good as i started it because i only seen the opening before starting the show an didn\u2019t expect a amazing plot well put together action senses that would make you want to fall of the edge of your chair also a lovable cast of main characters that couldn\u2019t have been any better.",

            "content": "Guess I'm a bit late to the Noragami party, considering I am reviewing its first season, while its second one has already finished recently.  Anyway, are the first 12 episodes any good to even make a consideration for its continuation with higher ratings?  Let's go and see.\r\n[VOICE ACTING]\r\nRight off the bat, I like the voice actors in Noragami.  This is straight bias, but I really like Yato's voice actor.  The voice actor is Hiroshi Kamiya, who also plays Koyomi Araragi in the Monogatari series.  His playful and unique voice has helped cement a more detailed personality of our protagonist, Yato.Yukine, one of the other two main characters, is voiced by Yuki Kaji.  This man portrays emotion very well and he might be recognizable if you have watched Attack on Titan before.  The voice acting in Noragami is simply great.\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\r\nOther positive components of Noragami include art and sound.  The art is generally very nice to look at.  Bones, the studio, does a great job at the various visual effects in fights presented and the crispness of the characters.  Yukine, in particular, stands out.  When he is on camera, his hair colour and design stick out and look great.  Action scenes' art ranges from decent enough to very good.  Some camera angles, I have noticed, turn out badly and make the viewer question the scene.  Also, when the characters are seen from far away, I have seen a lack of intensity in the strikes and clashes between weapons.  It's just not there.  On average though, action scenes are good from the design of Sekki (Yato's Divine Instrument).  The sword looks shiny and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\r\nSound is top notch.  The OP is one of the best in the year of 2014. It's catchy, upbeat, and has some intriguing visuals.  The ED is also above average.  What may prove to be a mixed bag is the OST.  Many viewers dislike the male voice autotune that sounds like it has Indian roots (I'm not trying to be racist here, sorry to anyone that this offends).  I believe the song accents the style of Noragami.  At its heart, I have thought that Noragami is a light-hearted action.  The soundtrack helps create the atmosphere of the streets...if that makes sense.  It makes the scene feel more urban.\\n\\n\r\n[STORY]\\n\r\nThe story is pretty solid.  We have a tale of an infamous god with no shrine to his name, picking up odd jobs for 5 yen coins.  I have found the premise to be pretty unique.  However, the pacing in the beginning of Noragami feels sluggish and boring.  The first quarter has not caught on in my experience, as there is a lack of tension and Yato drags the viewer into his mundane, repetitive lifestyle that others seem to dislike.  Later, in the anime, however, as the anime watcher becomes more exposed and engrossed towards the main characters, they gain charisma and the slice of life style works.  This is also complemented by the tense drama with Yato's past.  Since his past is so mysterious, there is an extra layer of depth into the story: mystery.  Overall, this is a pretty good story with a loose grasp on many genres including: supernatural, romance, mystery, slice of life, and action.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTERS]\\n\r\nYato, the god, has ended up being the only character of notice for me during the anime.  His personality is so fun and his telephone slogan is godly (GET IT?).  The other two characters, Yukine and Hiyori, are pretty average.  However, near the middle of Noragami, Yukine has been very annoying due to his almost immoral actions from my perspective.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\nAfter around episode 5, my interest has started to steam up a little.  The story has become more interesting and the characters more likable.  Around episode 9, I have found Noragami to be pretty contagious.  The tension and the build up for the next episode bloom a lot near the end, as there are more consequences and events unfolding from the viewer's point of view.  \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\nA solid anime that has a bizarre mix of genres that can work well together on a certain level.  Watch this if you like:\\n\r\n-Supernatural elements, with a deep amount of lore waiting to be discovered\\n\r\n-Slice of life, but not entirely slice of life\\n\r\n-Good action/art\\n\r\n-Urbanish music, amazing OP to put on your playlist",

I found it on Hulu and decided to give it a shot without really knowing anything about it, and what I got was pretty fair.  I did quite like the characters in the show, but I didn't really get the feeling that I got to know them as much as I'd like.  They did pretty well in setting up who is who, who's going through what, but I'm not so sure that I know everything that there is to be known about them.\r\nI suppose that's what you get for going into ashow with one planned season, and manga pending.  With that, most of my disappointment stems from me just wanting more of it.  The art was amazing, and the potential for a storyline is there.  The entire first season to me feels like a setup for something more.  I'm trying my best to not give anything away here, so it may sound really vague.\\n\\n\r\nSome very small plot points were solved in the long-run, but I didn't think they were serious enough for a show to be based on.  It's common knowledge that the main character runs into a god, has a problem retaining her soul, etc.  That much is kind of delved into, but everything else that happens is relatively erroneous, just small obstacles.  There's no grand scheme, and to get it, you'd probably be best reading the manga afterwards.  \\n\\n\r\nIn short, if the series continues, my ratings for the story would absolutely be higher.  All the other elements of Noragami are really amazing, but there's so much potential here for something awesome, I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed by the end.",

            "content": "I didn't think this series would be polarizing for many anime viewers. That said, I enjoyed it thoroughly. \r\nRight off the bat, I'd say watch this if you're a fan of good world-building. This series just sucks you right in with its concept, myths, and system. Honestly, it's probably the most intriguing aspect of the show and what made me bingewatch the first half in the first place (I paced myself, of course). For a short 12-episode season/1 cour, not once did I feel like the pace was too slow (okay, there were MOMENTS! But they're few and far in-between and they're your run-of-the-mill gotta-monologue-while-in-a-tense-situation!)or that it ended on a note that left me high and dry. While I can appreciate more of the misadventures and the lore (oh gods yes, give me more of that lore!), Noragami's first season can be viewed as a standalone in itself. I'm good with where and how it ended, even if I wanted to learn more about the characters but I guess I can start picking up the manga for that. Good thing we have a second season that's ongoing and I've heard it's even better. Nonetheless, I found this season to have a tight and cohesive storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, I have particularly found Yukine to be such an interesting one. You can either love him or hate him, but I feel like he makes sense and acts like a 14 year old does. I wanted to learn more about his past before he became the Regalia or the Shinki, but I liked how they didn't dwell on that at all. After all, would it matter now? Like Yato and Hiyori, I was pleased and proud of his character development by the end of his arc. As a character, Yato is pretty entertaining, too, like with most of the gods shown. He steals the scene every time and his VA/Seiyuu probably helps a lot. I've known him (most memorably, I believe) as Levi from SNK but this show really shows his versatility. At times, I can't believe that it's the same guy who voiced Levi and then there are other moments later in the season that I realized how perfect he is for it. Hiyori, oh sweet Hiyori. So endearing with her wrestling nerdiness, and while I adore her, I frankly find her a bit bland in comparison to the other characters in the show. While everyone else is amped up to their own archetypes and distinguishing characteristics, as the everyman and the audiences' stand-in, Hiyori works to balance and compliment them all. So I'm not really complaining. (She had badass scenes, too, anyway.) \\n\\n\r\nOn to the Art and Sound, I wasn't particular on those aspects of the show. Perhaps it's because it's something I already expected from its production? That none of it actually felt like it stood out or was already exceptional for me. I have to say, though, that the animation for banishing phantoms was pretty cool at first. None of it really wowed me enough to pause and take a picture. Soundtrack-wise, too, nothing much stood out for me but I did noticed that it was more experimental in some ways yet kept a touch of traditional Japanese music in at the same time. That was pretty neat but nothing to write home about (in my opinion, anyway). Not once was it distracting, though. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, would this be a title I'd recommend to anyone? Yes, I would wholeheartedly. It's a good watch, regardless of how you might feel about its characters. Highly entertaining and it makes for a great bingewatch. I let my thoughts and feelings for it simmer after I have finished watching it a couple of days ago (in the hopes of striking a balanced review that won't be too overcome with OH SHIT THAT'S GOOD I WANT MORE PLS) but still, my feelings about it remain the same: YES THIS IS GOOD SHIT I WANT MORE.\\n\\n\r\nSo thank the Gods that we now have Noragami Aragoto!",

It also features a decent soundtrack, wonderful animation style, and memorable characters. Before you get too excited, though, be warned that this series contains some major downsides, mostly in the story and character development.\r\nIt's difficult to explain without giving spoilers, but there were several elements of the plot and the Noragami world which ruffled my feathers and nearly ruined the series for me. The system of Gods and Weapons is flawed and unfair. The protagonist is a Narcissist posing as a moral authority.The development and closure for the character of Yuuki was, without giving spoilers, thoroughly disappointing. Many plot holes appear in this series as well. You can probably tell without hearing any spoilers that Noragami is not all it's cracked up to be.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I do think viewers should give this show a try; others may be less critical of the Gods' systems and less disappointed at the outcomes of the characters. One thing it really has going for it, too, is the humor of the series. In short, this one is hit-or-miss. You be like me: continually puzzled at the show's popularity, and thoroughly disappointed with the main characters. On the other hand you might fall in love with the characters, beautiful art, and comedic escapades. For me it only gets two and a half stars out of five.",

It combines just the right proportions of humor, action, reality, morality, and drama.   Noragami's pacing is great -- neither too fast nor too slow and at the end of each episode, you'll feel satisfied. The climaxes in this first season (which will hopefully not be the only season) do not disappoint.\r\nArt: The art deserves an A+. It's quirky since it combines fantasyelements with a normal, everyday environment, but the art really grows on you. The animations are also great, especially in the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: One of the first things I noticed about Noragami is how its music really enhances the story. The voice actors did a very good job too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Probably the most enjoyable part of Noragami was watching the characters evolve. (TINY SPOILER ALERT) The characters in Noragami are all flawed in their own ways and that's what makes the show so interesting. Seeing how the characters deal with their demons and grow up is really worthwhile. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall, 10/10. This show has everything I look for in an anime -- humor, action, good art and animation, a good storyline, touching moments, and memorable characters. Hopefully there will be a second season.",

It is a good one but not as good as Mirai Nikki, SAO, NGNL, Gnagsta or Gosick that have a rating of 8. But what is it now about, is the question?\r\nUp to the setting... The world of Noragami is divided into two parts: The Near Shore, the place where people recide, and the Far Shore, or the so called Afterlife where Gods, phantoms and dead souls live. The phantoms,or in Japanese Ayakashi, are emotional fragments that try to posses humans and cause all sorts of trouble. Now, the gods, fight the Ayakashi, and our main protagonist of this anime is none other than Yato, the god of war. They do it with the help of weapons called Shinki that are actually  spirits of dead poeple. \\n\r\nIn the very beginning of the story we meet Yato with his Shinki Tomone, that leaves him shortly after three months of work together. After being left alone, Yato decides to run simple errands without all the ayakashi stuff. And while chasing a little cat, he nearly got hit by a buss, but luckily a girl saved his life. Her name was Iki Hiyori. Hiyori was dead for a second but came back to life afterwards, causing her soul to become unstable and leave her body from time to time. In that \"body-less\" state Hiyori has a fancy, pink tail. In order to become normal again she asks Yato, as a god, to help her stabilize her soul. He accepts the job for 5 yen, but he firstly needs to find a new Shinki. (I think this an \"as expected\" situation, and so I don't see it as a spoiler). Yato will eventually find a new Shinki and that's when the whole fun begins. \\n\\n\r\nWhen talking about the story it self, it is necessary to mention that it is more the character development that makes the show, rather than the happenings.\\n\r\nThe idea behind the anime is very good in my opinion. The spirits and the gods fighting phantoms together, a girl whose soul leaves her body at least twice in one episode and  the steady flash backs from the past. I know I said in the beginning that I love 12-episode-long anime but while some anime would be better with less, Noragami would be better with a few more episodes. The background story of Yato's new Shinki, Yukine,  and the way he died weren't mentioned at all. There are some scenes in one episode where you can grasp a thought, but nothing more. Also, Yato's background story was told but it's not enough. There are a lot of questions left and I really wanted to get the answers in the anime because I don't feel like reading the manga now. Luckily, on October 3rd, 2015 Noragami Aragato (the 2nd season) started and is still airing. I am still not sure if I will start watching before it finishes airing, but I'll see. I think that we might get some answers about Yukine's history but not about Yato's. Still, figers crossed. \\n\r\nYet, I consider the character development and all the psychology in the anime to be its main turning point. The way Yato tries to kill the ghosts of his past, the way Yukine is being eaten by the causes of his own death again and the way Hiyori finds acceptance with her new self...Awesome. In addition to that, you also have the various cases of people trying to die or kill that actually happen everyday. Yato kinda finds his own way in solving those, although being the one that said that If they wanted to die, they should. \\n\r\nAnd while being very deep from time to time, Noragami is an anime that will sure make you laugh. There are tons of scenes that force at least a smile on your face. Especially Yato, being a person as he is, always does something very entertaining. \\n\r\nAnd while talking about entertainment, I don't want to forget all the action in the anime. Awesome fights are one of the shiny sides of Noragami and I definitely expect to see more in the next season. Can't wait for it. \\n\r\nNoragami has a very smooth plot line with a little plot hole here and there mostly while talking about the past. Still, a good character story and action blended everything out and made it so good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe happy-go-lucky YATO is actually one of the gods of war, but better known as the \"God of Calamity\". After his first Shinki leaves him, he starts calling him self  \"stray delivery god\" doing some odd jobs for just 5 yen. When it comes to his personality it's like he has two souls inside. At one moment he is the childish young man that does all kinds of silly things such as buying fake good luck charms. He is really persistent in trying to become a more popular god and so he writes his cellphone number wherever he goes. The other Yato is more serious and very mysterious. Some secrets of the past reveal his old self form a different time, and that is what I found the most intriguing part o the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here is she, our main female, IKI HIYORI. She is a daughter of a respectable family and a martial arts-loving junior high school student. She also has a older brother, and that's my dear readers what you know about her. I little bit more about her life would have made the anime considerably better. When it comes to her personality you can clearly see the positivism she carries all the time and her open and free soul. Also a very caring person that  thinks about others before her self. I hope the second season shows us more about Hiyori because I personally liked her a lot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is now YUKINE, Yato's new Shinki. He is a 14-year-old boy that was found by Yato while wandering around as a small spirit. In the Shinki form he has the name Shekki and transforms into a katana. Yukine died at a very young age and so he misses his normal life as a middle schooler. A bit sad and frustrated he stole money from people thinking it would be alright since he is dead. Luckily Hiyori saves him from becoming a \"bad boy\" and from then on Yukine becomes more respectful an obedient towards Hiyori and Yato. As said before, I juts hope that we will find out more about his life in the second season. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style\\n\\n\r\nAs expected, a very good job done by Bones, the same producers of Fullmeetal Alchemist, Soul Eater, Darker than Black, Gosick etc. The animation is great, I mean it would kinda be impossible  to be bad since we have the year 2014. When it comes to the style, there is something special about it, but I really can't figure out what exactly. I think it's the colors, but whatever it is, I love it. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nI can't wait to see the second season of Noragami. It is really an awesome anime with and intriguing and  well developed plot, nice story line and pretty good characters. I think that there is nothing left to say despite the fact that this anime is worth your time, and worth giving it a try in the second season Noragami Aragato (2015). \\n\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "I should probably say that the only reason the anime did not live up to expectations (despite the fact that it was a BONES production - I'll get to this later) is because it veered off the manga at the very end.\r\nALRIGHT, NOW THAT SAID, Let's begin my mediocre review.\r\nI. Story/ Plot & Pacing:\r\nLike many others I watched the anime first. Yes, I liked it. And Yes, there were plenty of things I didn't understand AT ALL. The reason being that the manga takes good time explaining various things (it has excellent pacing btw, the manga) but the anime is just 12 episodes. 12 episodesof 25 minutes each, no, not even that will do justice to something the manga explains in 12 chapters. This might sound unbelievable, but... well, that's the truth. The anime is rushed, especially with regards to Yukine's Arc (which is the first arc) and because of this, I think, Yukine's character doesn't develop as well as it did in the manga. More of that later. \\n\\n\\n\r\nII. Characterization:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the manga brings out the very best when it comes to character development, the anime doesn't do so good a job. Again, this is because it is only 12 episodes. I enjoyed the anime when I saw it, but after reading the manga later on I understood what the anime had missed out on. Yato, Yukine, Hiyori, Mayu, Kofuku, Daikoku, Bishamon, Kazuma... they all have spectacular characters but the anime doesn't do them justice. Well, not as well anyways. For example you see Bishamon in season 1 and she's depicted as a revenge-hungry, Yato-blood thirsty villain - when in reality that's not what she is at all! \\n\r\nThis would probably be the anime's biggest flaw - in twelve episodes there's only so much you can do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIII. Art & Animation:\\n\\n\r\nBONES always delivers when it comes to this, and Noragami is NOT an exception. The art and animation is SPECTACULAR in my opinion and this is no surprise - BONES is famous for its high quality production team.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIV. SOUNDTRACK:\\n\\n\r\nYES, IT IS IN CAPS. It's because Noragami's soundtrack is SO EPIC on SO MANY LEVELS that it's impossible to put it in words! Noragami's soundtrack defines the show's entire personality - something you don't find a lot of other shows having. Taku Iwasaki is a genius! After getting the CD and playing it on repeat for something like a month (I still do LOL), I find that I cannot watch OR read Noragami without this soundtrack playing in my head. IMPOSSIBLE. SPECTACULAR. ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. \\n\\n\\n\r\nV. The Ending:\\n\\n\r\nThe only qualm I have is that the anime veered off at the end. After Yukine's arc, theoretically it is supposed to be Bishamon's arc. But to conclude as an ending to season 1, they decided to put in a subplot (Yato vs. Rabo) which isn't even in the manga, to be honest. It's a side story special instead. Integrating this minor story with the original was not... um, a very good choice, but I don't blame BONES because Bishamon's arc is a hefty piece. You need a minimum of 10 episodes for that alone, and I suppose BONES wanted to see how season 1 goes before going any further. Which is why the anime abruptly ends the way it does. \\n\\n\r\nHey, but then we have Season 2 which looks like it will stay true to the manga adaptation of the second (Bishamon's) arc! :D! Woohoo!\\n\\n\\n\r\n VI. Overall:\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was decent. I liked it enough to get into the manga (which I should mention at this point is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT, SO GO READ IT!) and therefore, I am now obsessed with Noragami. With this show you will find yet another quality anime - I guarantee that. \\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that the a few of the low ratings for Noragami (like 5, 6 and 7) are because of the rushed-12 episode factor. If not for that, the ratings would've been pretty high - like the manga (and even season 2, yes!) has ^^/",

            "content": "Damn. Damn. Damn. \r\nWell done. Finally an anime with something decently different and exciting. \r\nI am pretty happy with this anime. Before I get into talking about the specifics, let me just say that the overall impression of this anime at first wasn't anything that great. However, right away this series dives right into a world pretty unique  that just grabs your attention. \r\nUsually I would point out a section of the anime that deserves less praise, but with this anime I really felt that doing that is unnecessary. The story, which is the downfall of many anime, did not lose its touch. Manyseries get a good start but then really flop, hence why people become disappointed. Noragami does not slip up one bit. It continues to add to the plot, not only holding my attention more but strengthening the bonds made with the characters. It is pretty rare that a story can tie well into the character's essence but I would say this does a fine job.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is stellar; really one of the best parts of this show. It is sharp and clear, as well as vibrant and colorful. Each fight scene, which doesn't come too, too often is just action-packed and stuffed with great moves. All too often the action feels stale after awhile but the style was so jumpy and all over the place that it really gave each fight its own flare. The monsters are all super colorful which really brings power not only to the fighting but to the story as well. I would really recommend this anime for the art alone. Thankfully, the other parts are all pretty awesome as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was very spiritual while still managing to be modern and cool sounding. The elements of the Japanese deities can be felt through the different sound-bytes and tunes that glimmer through the story. This music really makes you feel the main character's feelings. For having such diversity in its moods, I would say the music plays a large part. As music usually does, the music sets the stage for each change of pace. And let me note, there are quite a few in this anime. From lighthearted, comedy to intense battles, threats, evil auras and despair, the music changes each time. I really thought the sound brought the art and story into the realm of a great anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are captivating, holding my attention and making me really feel for each mistake or triumph the characters had. This anime really knows not to shove too many faces into your head and focuses on a few at a time. Due to that, you really connect and feel like you are a part of the team. There were a few times where I wanted to cry along side the characters. I won't waste your time explaining what I liked about the characters. See for yourself. This anime is definitely worth seeing. It did not leave a giant void in my mind about some horribly unforeseeable ending, nor does it lose my interest once finished. I want a second season but at the same time I am content with what was made. Isn't that odd? That can't be true very often. Anyways, this is a must see anime. Enjoy!\\n",

            "content": "This review does not contain any spoilers for the series.\r\nNoragami is far more rooted in comedy than I had anticipated when beginning the series. I oftentimes anticipate the 'feel' of a show through its key visual, and more often than not I am wrong in my initial assumptions. Noragami isn't as serious as I would have liked, but the comedy doesn't necessarily fall flat nor dampen my experience too much. It works for the most part, but comedy usually isn't what keeps me coming back to a show. I found most episodes to follow the same relative formula of a comedic first half and amore serious second half interspersed with goofy moments. With such a focus on comedy and considering the series begins with little more than mere hints at something more than an average show - namely the introduction of Phantoms - I was certainly wary. The first three episodes of the first season of Noragami lack intrigue. What is provided was enough to keep me going and the setting created is a few steps away from generic, but it was another series where I struggled to become interested.\\n\\n\r\nMy most serious concern, however, is Yukine. Part of me feels like this is because the voice actor played Shuu, an equally unlikable character from Guilty Crown. Yukine is a character that lacks depth, an average teenager with issues of angst. While he does see some change near the end of the first season, it does not feel as though he truly understands the weight of his actions and their consequences. It could be argued that this was intentional - that this is how an average teenager may respond in such a situation - but I can't get over how bland of a character he truly is. This becomes an issue in more serious scenes, as the true identity of Yukine is unknown, leading to each of his actions, especially those which are good intentioned, seeming somewhat out of character.\\n\\n\r\nThere are enough elements working against the series that the anime must constantly work to keep me pleased. Fortunately, it does a good job of outweighing the negatives. Yato is a great character who actually has a personality. In stark contrast to Yukine, Yato is likable and is among the few characters whose comedy works on me. Kofuku, the God of Poverty, was another character who I enjoyed quite a bit. Each Phantom also has a really interesting design; although most Phantoms take on the shape of an animal or mythical creature, I really like the use of eyeballs and colors to depict something other-worldly. The eyeballs which occasionally appear on dark backgrounds remind me a lot of similar scenes in Aku no Hana. The sounds these Phantoms make are also very reminiscent of the ending theme to Aku no Hana, which I thought was actually pretty interesting, given both deal with themes of angst and pressure. Above all else, though, I am a huge fan of the soundtrack for Noragami. The music alone is able to carry the show in my opinion, as each track is simply delightful (save the ED, however, which I am not much a fan of).\\n\\n\r\nNoragami's first season was solid. What it provided was certainly cool and a step in the right direction, but I'm not sure that it is entirely memorable. Unfortunately, the series is dragged down by various elements. Yato seems to have carried the series on his shoulders alone, being the character which provides the greatest humor, depth, and emotion. I do feel that it is worth watching, but do not anticipate brilliance nor absolute cohesion.",

            "content": "I originally gave this series a 10 without any other thought, but coming back I realized that it's not all that I made it out to be. But it still got spunk.\r\nNoragami! An anime about gods, tails, and teenage years. And a story that follows Yato god, or better known as your personal agent who'll help you clean out your bathroom by six, and then will be slaying ghosts by nine. The story revolves on the fact that Yato almost gets hit by a truck, but Hiyori, an average high school student, comes to his rescue. She then wakes up in a hospital and realizesthat she can hear things, and that she isn't fully human anymore; and that there's a stray god under her sheets with her. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I really like best about this series is it's characters. Yato, with his tragic past, changed his ways to become more...entertaining, and clumsy. He later finds his \"Shinki,\" or weapon that only gods can use. And finds out that it's a young boy around the teenage years, and soon finds out that he's a mixed bag. It's a really great story with interesting characters, but it does fail at times when it falls short to the obvious tropes that it shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was just, good. Nothing amazing about it. But personally I found the phantoms to be kind of creepy-looking. The sound, and more specifically the OP and ED are excellent and really catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this anime to anyone who likes a lot of good action with a hint of romance to it. It's got some cliches, but if you can look past them, it's definitely worth the time.",

I kinda got bored of the part about Yukine's wrongdoings , and maybe the final part was a bit short.\r\nSo, in a nutshell, I guess the rhythm was not adapted. 7\r\nArt : Visually, I was pleased : it's a colorful anime, especially the \"execution\" scenes. It sometimes had over the top art, which imo blended well when used. Also, the fights were clear, something I consider really important in anime like these. 9\r\nSound : I don't really know what to think of it. I watched the dub version, andI had no problem with the voices. I did find some part of the OST corny. 7\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : The trio is really memorable and charming. The other gods also are well designed. I kinda regret the lack of development and explanation on the Bashimon-Yato relationship but I think it is explained in S2. 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : Although I did find the part about yukine long, I really got hooked up by the setting. 9\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : I would recommend this anime as it is versatile : it has fights, humor, and some kind of romance in a way... And my hopes are up for S2! 8",

So this story is about Yato a God of War that isn't really all that well known. Gods use weapons called Regalia that are actually pure human spirits. So Yato finds a wandering spirit that had not been tainted and gave him a human name Yukine, which then turns him into human form. He also gave him a regalia name so when he calls that name, Yukine turns into his weapon form.So the story goes on about Yato and Yukine as they are in search for jobs so Yato can build his own shrine. They struggle to get along as they face many challenges together. I though the characters had really good development throughout both seasons. This show never got boring to me and had some good hit ya in the feels moments but also had many moments that made me laugh! I found this show super entertaining and would recommend it to people!",

            "content": "When i started watching , i got a feeling that this would be really similar to bleach . But although the two share some similarity, the main elements of the two are completely different. And this makes for a really enjoyable experience.\r\nBut unlike bleach , Noragami has a  little more darker tone to it. But at the same time , it maintains a comedic atmosphere for the most part , thanks to some very likeable MC's\r\n~MAIN CHARACTERS~\r\n1. Yato - A minor deity who does odd jobs for anyone for a meagre payment of 5 yen , all in the hopes of building his ownshrine .\\n\\n\r\n2. Hiyori - A school girl, who becomes a half-phantom ( half dead) follwing a traffic accident involving Yato. She is able to see Yato, amongst other dieties and phantoms.\\n\\n\r\n3. Yukinae - Yato's regalia ( Divine Instrument ) , he is just a stubborn small boy and hence acts as such towards his equally childish master\\n\\n\r\n~SYNOPSIS~\\n\\n\r\nThe story basically follows Yato trying to fix Hiyori. Hiyori's soul occasionally slips out of her body as a result of which her physical body enters into a sleeping state, while her conscious state steps out of her body. The story takes atleast 3 episodes before it becomes truly interesting. But after that it is one roller coaster ride. \\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT~\\n\\n\r\nBut as far as character development is concerned , i was pretty disappointed . We only get a vague insight into Yato's past , whilst Yukinae gets a few short seconds regarding his past. But they did do a good job of DEVELOPING his character post his entry into the story . Hiyori atleast does serve a more important role than just being there for driving the plot, she really helps to forge the bond between Yato and Yukinae. As for the rest of the characters , they dont get too much development as you'd want. But with the corporate pressure to pump out a story un just 12 episodes , i'd say the anime makers did a good job. \\n\\n\r\n~SHOUNEN TAG~\\n\\n\r\nAs a shounen anime , it left me wanting more. The main focus isnt killing phantoms , but it felt more like a side quest and just a plot device to make the ending a but more interesting. Barring the last few epsiodes , the fights felt  really repetitive ..as if they were placeholders.. to keep us watching till eventually the final fight produces something different (Kind of like all those monster who get destroyed in every Power Rangers ever ) .  And Yato's finishing move becomes kind of overused and boring. \\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~ \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the opening and ending songs were excellent , thats where the good ends . The BGM was really unspectacular and forgettable. Which was kind of a let down\\n\\n\r\n~ARTSTYLE~ \\n\\n\r\nThis all boils down to one's subjective preferences. I personally loved the art style they use for the characters. Although, i did wish they'd have been a little more imaginative with the monsters.\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL VERDICT ~\\n\\n\r\nI went into this anime having high hopes. But what i got was completely different to what i'd expected. I had expected a more dark story with plenty of action. But i got a little more light hearted experience , which wasnt bad at all , but i just felt they should have given the fights little more importance.\\n\r\nThe way the story ended , it kind of suggested that they wanted to make a second season , but they were unsure if the anime would be well received. But it went to do very well and as expected it has a second season. \\n\\n\r\nI gave it a 7 /10 purely because of lacklustre action and character development that left me unsatisfied with season 1. \\n",

It seemed to have covered all my questions about how Gods/Goddesses see the world. I think after maybe 5 or 4 episodes they begin to get into the story.\r\nWhen it comes to art even if you don't like the show you would probably still watch it because it is so incredibly visually pleasing. Yato has these brilliant blue eyes that contrast the black & white colours of his clothes and hair. It has a very nice style that describes each and every charactervery well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music on the other hand was quite unique but would repeat quite a lot. I wouldn't find myself listening to it anytime soon and whenever people heard this song while I was watching this anime it would be quite humiliating.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise it's either a hit or miss. Personally my favourites were Yato, Kofuku (The God of Poverty) and Nora. Many agree that Yato and Kofuku are their favourites too. I personally like Nora because she is such a mysterious evil villain.\\n\\n\r\nIt was quite enjoying and I would personally recommend it to a person planning on watching anime for the first time.\\n\\n\\n",

The serious scenes make you invested in the situation or plot at hand. Every one of the characters possesses the ability for you to care about them, whether or not you do is up to you. The heartwarming scenes are cute and put a smile on your face. The animation is crisp, and visually pleasing. Theworld is interesting, and spends a lot of time fleshing it out, but does it in a great way to where it does not bore you.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, this anime is everything you've seen before, and nothing you've seen before. It is feels familiar, and at the same time continues to show you something new and fresh. It might not be the greatest thing you'll watch, but without a doubt it is entertaining and worth all 12 episodes.",

            "content": "Noragami is definitely one of the best anime I have ever seen in my life! I\u2019d give this an 8.5 if I could. When I first watched this, never have I expected to witness such a well-laid out plot and story with actually flawed and more realistic-feeling characters. No wonder Noragami is so popular!\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe new and rather unique concept Noragami has with Phantoms and Regalias make the anime interesting for one thing. It\u2019s certainly not just some slice-of-life romantic (not that it is, lol, tho it looked like that to me a few years ago). This is the kind of anime that majorly wrapsaround a concept we\u2019re not familiar with, so it gives us new information on it as well as plot advancement with the characters as the episodes progress. The plots are definitely good as well! I\u2019d only have to criticize the first episode around Hiyori and Yato\u2019s meeting (just of how the anime was making it way way WAY too obvious that Hiyori would become a main character and really need to decrease some of that) and Yukine\u2019s arc for the most part, but even that\u2019s rather fine once you realize how easy it is to have the same situations as he did if you were him. Also, this is just random, but I love how Noragami\u2019s story developed the characters well enough to where ships like Yato x Yukine, Yato x Hiyori, and Hiyori x Yukine are 100% understandable. I\u2019ll just say I used to not really like Yatori due to the shippers of it I found indirectly claiming Hiyori x Yukine as pedophilia despite shipping REAL pedophilia themselves, and prefered Hiyori x Yukine, until later on when Yato and Hiyori\u2019s relationship developed to where I started shipping Yatori a bit instead. Not sure what to do about Yato\u2019s age, tho-\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI admit, there were a few times I didn\u2019t like the artstyle due to how the noses didn\u2019t set very well with me at those times. However, it\u2019s actually really nice! The hair of the characters tend to be quite beautiful and attractive, especially around the end of the anime, and the eyes are practically breath-taking! I often found myself staring at the characters\u2019 hairs or eyes during episodes due to how eye-catching they were. The designs are very nice and appetizing as well, and gives off a kind of uniqueness that don\u2019t seem to be able to be matched with other characters (specific examples include how I think Hiyori doesn\u2019t look good with Yato\u2019s eyes, and how Yukine probably wouldn\u2019t look right at all if he had Kazuma or someone\u2019s eyes. Not to mention, I love how Nora was the only one given raven-black eyes! It really references to the rumor/sterotype that started some years ago that black-eyed children were mysterious and drop-dead dangerous, due to the number of times such children created peculiar horrifying memories for some people).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nBrO, have you heard the opening and ending?? While I don\u2019t think the opening don\u2019t fit entirely well with the anime, it does compliment the intensity of the anime that comes when Phantoms or whatever similar and their antics come into play. It\u2019s also catchy and l i t, and I definitely like it. It doen\u2019t help that it has an alternate/fanmade version called \u201cMyths Break Down,\u201d since that one\u2019s catchy as HELL (still prefer Hello Sleepwalkers, tho). The ending is also beautiful and breathtaking, and its music goes very well with its lyrics! With how the ending compliments the wisdom and sweet friendship that comes with Noragami as well, I feel that Heart Realize also contrasts with the opening quite well! Maybe. But I like the contrast regardless-\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nIf you were expecting another Kirito (I\u2019m so sorry, I do know he does have a little bit of deep character, but almost all of us know he\u2019s basically nothing but a Gary Stue-), prepare to have that expectation wrecked. Yato is a silly dork yet jerk (at first, anyway) that next to no one trusts/likes, Hiyori is a kind yet somewhat flawed girl (that I found myself relating to up to the later episodes), and Yukine is a stubborn yet lonely teenager that\u2019s originally very perverted. The other characters are definitely flawed as well, though it\u2019d be too much to review theirs here as well. Technically, Hiyori is the least flawed out of the entire character cast in my opinion. She also slowly became more of a cliche anime girl, but she\u2019s still not as bad as some anime girls (not that I hated any, but you know-). <spoiler>I think Yukine was being a bit too edgy during his arc, however. There was a bit too much focus on that, too. It took me a while - and it still is - to understand that Yukine had plenty of reason to be like that. We must remember that he\u2019s only 14, an age where it\u2019s easy af to become edgy, ESPECIALLY if you\u2019re stuck with a useless and old-fashioned jerk who treats you like nothing but a tool and a dead-alive life that makes it impossible for you to have the same welcoming-seeming life kids YOUR age get to have. Let\u2019s also remember that when you\u2019re younger, it\u2019s easier to exaggerate things in your mind and only notice the bad things, so that would explain why Yukine started making a bit too much of a deal over his lonely and \u201cfriendless\u201d life.</spoiler>\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nYou... can tell I definitely enjoyed this anime. While I still can\u2019t officially call myself a fan (though others may find it fit to call me such), I know I most likely would\u2019ve given myself that title if I watched Noragami within less time and continued watching the OVA & reading the manga soon after as well! I must also mention how I love how Noragami doesn\u2019t seem to love naked anime girls THAT much, though apparently enough to show Hiyori in her bathtub quite a number of times for some reason. Oh, and I have to say, the times whenever Yato gets shocked are my favorite! He has the freaking best (general) shocked reactions ever-\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nWhile there are some things here and there that could certainly be improved, Noragami is overall a very good anime! I would definitely recommend this to people, though I would actually wimp out, maybe, haha... ^^\u201d Mostly since my internet friends seem to hate these kind of things easily? It\u2019s not that I think it\u2019s not ok to dislike Noragami, because it really is ok to dislike this kind of show. (In case some of the Noragami fandom attacks me for this, knowing how aggressive it can be-) It\u2019s just how it might not be wise to recommend stuff to people who hate these kind of shows and earn yourself the reward of hearing them say \u201cI hate this.\u201d \u201cSorry, but I lowkey hate this; it sucks-\u201c \u201cI wouldn\u2019t stop cringing-\u201c (I\u2019ve lately gotten more sensitive to opinions, ok, I'm sorry-). Aanyway, if you have\u2019t watched Noragami yet, I definitely recommend you try it out! It\u2019ll definitely be worth it! Make sure to watch 3 episodes and not 1 if you\u2019re thinking of trying it out! ^^",

            "content": "Noragami seems to have a lot of mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed it. I think this has a lot to do with where you approach it from: by far the vast majority of unfavorable reviews seem to be disappointed in Noragami's lack of focus in its plot. \r\nI can see where this would be a major downside to a lot of people; many shounen series with a similar target audience focus a lot on plot and a lot on battles. They're mostly about the journey of the main character down some kind of plot-based rabbit hole, whether it's being \"the best\" at something orfighting against a big power.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is neither of those things; it's billed as a comedy, and while it definitely has moments of humor, Most of them are character-based. This show is really a character-based comedy, I would say similar to earlier Takahashi in overall feel. There is a lot here that is episodic and more about exploring this very interesting world than focused on some overarching conflict that includes Yato. Like character-driven anime comedies of the nineties, this show is mostly a show about characters interacting in this world with some plot sprinkled in than a show about exploring big plot-focused ideas. \\n\\n\r\nIn that vein, Noragami succeeds *wonderfully*--every character in this show is very lovable and interesting while being complex and not one-note. Yato, Yukine and Hiyori--our three leads--in particular show wonderful growth as human beings over the course of this series. The mark of a truly successful anime romcom is that you start the show neutral on the main couple and by the end want to write terrible fanfic about them. [SPOILER] Hiyori and Yato definitely fit that definition and by the end I was cheering them on. [/SPOILER] Yukine really shines as a Japanese delinquent, with hints of what his past might be without overwhelming the show with them, and delivering *just* enough conflict with his character arch that you're on the edge of your seat without being exhausted by his trauma.\\n\\n\r\nIt's been awhile since I watched a show like this--I tend to gravitate toward more \"big idea\" anime that are considered somewhat \"artsy\", like Moribito. This was a wonderfully refreshing return to earlier anime I loved back in the late nineties and early naughts, but much better balanced in terms of plot progress and characterization. Unlike some of those shows, this one never feels too filler-y or confused on where the character arcs are headed.\\n\\n\r\nif you are looking for 12 episodes of pure enjoyment--something that brings you along for a ride without making you feel exhausted--I heartily recommend \"Noragami.\"",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nNoragami is supposed to be a shonen. Let's take the assumption back: \"Noragami\" is a shonen. That ambiguous term so ambiguous that the theory says it is given by a target audience (literally meaning boy, teenager), but that in the end it has become practically a genre in itself. Male protagonist, companions and camaraderie, many fights, lots of humour and occasionally a more serious plot. Maybe always, or practically always, settled in a fantastic world or at least in a world with lots of fantasy elements.\r\nSo is this \"Noragami\"? Well... actually, yes. It has all these elements in greater or lessermeasure, but it transmits something different, as it does not end up anchored in the \"simplicity\" (not as something bad) that usually has the shonen. It's atypical. It is true that the protagonist is masculine and has friends, but it is not a relationship like Luffy's with his \"nakamas\" in \"One Piece\". It's true that there are fights, but it's not that they have a great importance in the story, you won't see fights of several chapters as \"Dragon Ball\" or they will become a string of techniques and increasingly strong powers as in \"Naruto\".\\n\\n\r\nComparisons apart, one of the strong points of this anime is precisely its variety of situations, that ability to combine all sorts of circumstances. There are more serious moments which the plot is advancing, more relaxed moments with a fairly good humour (remember me to \"Gintama\", overcoming distances), sad and melancholic moments, epic moments of action and struggle... practically everything. And also each one in its right measure, very well fitted and with an agile rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nThe staff of characters is not too extensive. Nor too remarkable, in this sense one could say that it is more typical. Still, they do their job and I found them pleasant. The protagonist, Yato, others like Hiyori or secondary characters like Kofuku and Daikoku are good characters. The only one who squeaks me a little bit is Yukine, at least in part of the season (nearly all of it). I'm sorry, but I'm not the one who's putting up with selfish, firecrackers and unbearable pre-teen characters. They become completely insufferable to me in their absurd crusade against everything and everyone.\\n\\n\r\nI spoke earlier about the varied \"Noragami\" situations. This sensation is also contributed by the great soundtrack of the show, which adapts perfectly to this diversity. Instrumental melodies of classical style, electronic music, ethnic songs... Great work of the composer. Also special mention for a good ending. The opening, although original, is no more than standar in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, despite continuing the story in a second season and leaving many loose ends, the plot is interesting, especially considering that they have only had 12 chapters to develop it. There is still a lot to tell and clarify, but somehow the end would not be out of place at all if it had to be a unique season. It is worth seeing even if the shonen don't catch your eye, \"Noragami\" is a different shonen.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Translated and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nSe supone que \"Noragami\" es un shonen. Quitemos la suposici\u00f3n: \"Noragami\" es un shonen. Ese t\u00e9rmino tan ambiguo que la teor\u00eda dice que viene dado por un p\u00fablico objetivo (literalmente significa chaval, adolescente), pero que al final se ha convertido pr\u00e1cticamente en un g\u00e9nero en s\u00ed mismo. Protagonista masculino, compa\u00f1eros y camarader\u00eda, muchos combates, mucho humor y de vez en cuando alguna trama m\u00e1s seria. Si me apuras siempre, o pr\u00e1cticamente siempre, en un mundo fant\u00e1stico o como poco con much\u00edsimos elementos de fantas\u00eda.\\n\\n\r\n\u00bfEntonces es eso \"Noragami\"? Bueno... en realidad s\u00ed. Tiene todos esos elementos en mayor o menor medida, pero transmite algo diferente, como que no termina de anclarse en la \"simpleza\" (no como algo malo) que suele tener el shonen. Es at\u00edpico. Es cierto que el protagonista es masculino y tiene sus compa\u00f1eros, pero no es una relaci\u00f3n como la de Luffy con sus \"nakamas\" en \"One Piece\". Es cierto que hay combates, pero no es que tengan una gran importancia en la historia, ni mucho menos ver\u00e1s combates de varios cap\u00edtulos como en \"Dragon Ball\" o estos se convertir\u00e1n en una ristra de t\u00e9cnicas y poderes cada vez m\u00e1s fuertes como en \"Naruto\".\\n\\n\r\nComparaciones aparte, uno de los puntos fuertes de este anime es precisamente su varidad de situaciones, esa capacidad de combinar todo tipo de circunstancias, por decirlo de alguna forma. Hay momentos m\u00e1s serios en los que la trama va avanzando, momentos m\u00e1s relajados con un humor bastante bueno (me recuerda a \"Gintama\", salvando las distancias), momentos tristes y melanc\u00f3licos, momentos \u00e9picos de acci\u00f3n y lucha... pr\u00e1cticamente de todo. Y adem\u00e1s cada uno en su justa medida, muy bien encajados y con un ritmo \u00e1gil.\\n\\n\r\nEl plantel de personajes no es demasiado extenso. Tampoco demasiado destacable, en este sentido s\u00ed que se podr\u00eda decir que es m\u00e1s t\u00edpico. Aun as\u00ed, cumplen con su labor y me resultaron agradables. El protagonista, Yato, otros como Hiyori o secundarios como Kofuku y Daikoku son buenos personajes. El \u00fanico que me chirr\u00eda un poco es Yukine, al menos durante parte de la temporada (pr\u00e1cticamente toda). Lo siento, pero a estas alturas de la pel\u00edcula no soy yo de los que aguantan bien a los personajes preadolescentes ego\u00edstas, petardos e insoportables. Se me hacen completamente insufribles en su cruzada absurda contra todo y todos.\\n\\n\r\nHablaba antes de lo variado de las situaciones de \"Noragami\". A esta sensaci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n aporta la grand\u00edsima banda sonora de la que hace gala, que se adapta como un guante a esta diversidad. Melod\u00edas instrumentales de corte cl\u00e1sico, m\u00fasica electr\u00f3nica y con ritmo, canciones \u00e9tnicas... Grandioso trabajo del compositor. Menci\u00f3n aparte tambi\u00e9n para un ending a buen nivel. El opening, aunque original, no pasa de cumplidor en mi opini\u00f3n.\\n\\n\r\nPor \u00faltimo, a pesar de continuar la historia en una segunda temporada y quedar muchos cabos sueltos, la trama resulta interesante, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta que solo han tenido 12 cap\u00edtulos para desarrollarla. A\u00fan hay bastante que contar y aclarar, pero de alguna forma el final no desentonar\u00eda para nada si hubiera tenido que ser temporada \u00fanica. Merece la pena verla aunque los shonen no te llamen demasiado la atenci\u00f3n, \"Noragami\" es un shonen diferente.",

            "content": "Noragami is not the best anime ever, but al put together it's a really enjoyable anime. The plot is alright, and has flaws in it. But it is the character development that makes this a great anime. The band between Yato and Yukine is one of the greatest thing of the show. It starts of rocky, but ends up in loyalty. Which is really pleasant to see. It's childish as well mature. The dynamics between the others characters are quite questionable. Yato seems to have dark and famous past and they all react differently on it. Which it makes me wonder how serious it should'vebeen.\\n\\n\r\nThe season is divided in 2 stories which both are good (compared to SAO the second part of the season was getting worse).  I quickly rushed through the season to watch the second one as well. Noragami, is combination fantasy, shounen and comedy, So if you're looking for a action and a good laugh, Noragami is worth a watch, and the second season as well!\\n",

I can count on one hand how many anime I have dropped.  I usually grit my teeth and bear it until the end. But I just couldn't do it for Norigami. Maybe the last 2 episode completely change and redeem everything about the show, but I really doubt it. It had a lot of potential that was wasted, and in the end, Bad story + Bad characters = Bad Anime. There are so many better anime out there with similar genres. Don't waste your timewith this one.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nNorigami has a very cool interesting world, with lots of potential. Which is why it sucks that the story is so mediocre.- an old god that wants to be famous befriends a girl that wants to be human again. We get glimpses into Yato's past, but the slow pacing of the show ruins any suspense or drama. There are other things going on, but none of them are developed enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nThe characters are incredibly mediocre. The background characters aren't developed enough with the exception of one or two.\\n\r\nYato is the only main character of interest, and although we get some insight into Yato's backstory, overall he's just not enough to redeem the other characters.\\n\r\nHiyori Iki loses all relevance after 3 episodes, and her only job becomes to scream and cry, and act as cheerleader/babysitter for Yato and Yuki. \\n\r\nYuki is just awful. Maybe you were tempted to sympathize with Yuki initially, (because being dead and having no family sucks) but he just keeps being an asshole, and even after his 'redemption', he's still just a whiny asshole with no redeeming qualities. Every time I saw him on screen, I wanted to just skip past the scene, because I found him so unlikable.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 7/10\\n\r\nBoth the art and sound are average, with nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nBad story + Bad characters = Bad Anime.\\n\r\nI really wanted to like Norigami, because I really liked the world, but I couldn't.\\n",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Noragami. Overall this was really an enjoyable experience. One of my biggest issues comes with typical righteous attitude, but more on that in a bit.\r\nThe story is good.  We follow a god named Yato as he goes around and helps people with their wishes. Yato however is a third rate god it seems. He is poor, and doesn't even have his own shrine. This of course isn't a problem to him, he says one day he will and dreams of having a huge shrine and several female divine instruments attending to him.\r\nDuring one of his jobshe runs into a girl who for most of the story has an unfulfilled wish. The first few episodes are mostly getting to know Yato, this girl and understanding the world of gods, humans, dead, and monsters. The middle to near the end we have to suffer through sickening annoying character interactions between this girl, Yato's divine instrument and Yato. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is alright, nothing spectacular. The soundtrack was awesome and the voice acting was good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bag. Yato being our main character is really fun. He is mostly childish and comedic. They play up the lower status god bit early with him getting clothes from gym rooms and eating out of trash cans. He is powerful but not overly so. His divine instrument which he calls Yukine is a young boy(middle-high school). He however has issues with his own death and accepting things as they are and is the center of a lot of fuss. Iki, Hiyori is the girl as previously mentioned. She is connected to this hidden world due to her actions early with Yato. Now she tries to get him to help her, but she is insanely interfering. Never mind her new found power and how shes ignorant about the limitations and dangers, but how she tries to be the moral good that is trying to correct Yato. Watching her interfere with Yukine is like having someone come over to your house and start feeding your dog treats or food from their plate and telling you its fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters play a supporting role. They seem rooted in the story but we don't get to learn much about them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoy Noragami. I hated dealing with Hiyori. The story started off comical and less action based and I wished they stayed with that. However they went off into crappy growing pains drama and moral backbone interfering character. This took the focus away from Yato and gave it to Yukine and Hiyori but we know next to nothing about them after its all said and done. That being said, the world of gods and divine instruments and how they interact with one another and with humans was really well done and fun. The world building was solid and I loved it, the characters/story could have been better. Still looking forward to season 2.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Pretty good. Kinda funny, great world building, poor character conflict for the majority of the show. I would recommend this to anyone who likes shows with hidden powers or gods.",

            "content": "Noragami was one of the first anime I had seen when I started watching anime and was no doubt my favourite. \r\nNow that I go back (and this is after Noragami Aragato came out) I realize that the first anime, Noragami, was really just a filler.\r\nStory: 7.5/8\r\nNoragami is an anime about Yato, a \"stray god\" who'll do any job for the charge of 5 yen. While barely staying alive from his lack of worshippers his shiniki (weapon) quit, realizing that he's a 'good for nothing god' and decided to go elsewhere, leaving Yato more desperate for jobs and vulnerable.\r\nCoincidently, while doing a job of findinga cat, a young girl named Hiyori Iki comes into the play when she jumps and pushes Yato away from a bus that would hit him, hitting her. This leaves Hiyori now a soul that is between the Near Shore (normal life) and the Far Shore, where evil spirits called Ayakashi remain. \\n\\n\r\nNow stuck together by a wish Hiyori made, Yato's job is to restore Hiyori to the way she was before the accident, find a new Shiniki, and to try not to die in the process.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nIn Noragami, the art I'd say was very nice, having a very nice art style, the animation was very fluid and fitting in the everyday life as well as the action scenes. Not much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe music was fitting according to each scene. I watched the anime when there was only an English Sub, so the Japanese voice acting was good I guess? I'm Canadian and don't know Japanese so..... yeah.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all unique in their own way, which is refreshing from the bland predictable ones.\\n\\n\r\nHiyori- A middle school girl who is obsessed with MMA (I think) fighting and her true love, (whatever that guys name is, lol)\\n\\n\r\nYato- A cheerful no-name god that at times is a pervert, is the comedic relief but can be fatherly to characters to come.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nIt was a really good anime, but I can't rank it higher than an 8 because, for me who read the manga, it wasn't a really good adaptation and was kind of useless besides character introduction and plot creation if you compare it to the second anime, where actual plot content that suffices to the story is shown.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is a very good anime for a newcomer to anime or manga, but for someone that has been in the community for a while, I'd say either read the manga (it contains the events that matter) or just skip to the second anime, Noragami Aragato.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely do recommend it, though watching it again now, I was very displeased at how they continued the story (I own and have read all of the manga up to release, 1-18)\\n",

Yet the God Yato declares himself beyond the boundaries of human morality by which his human foils wish to define him.\r\nThe world building is curious and fascinating just like Yato's conflicted character. Fickle humanity has left the unchanging god without purpose. We Pity Yato the proud god brought low eeking out what meager existence he can in a world that has long since left his ways behind; even while we fear him as the unknown, and as a manifestation ourthe evil within us. He suspends our judgement of him indefinitely and the careful atmosphere of tension is interspersed with disarming humour and slice of life scenes.\\n\\n\r\nit's highly enjoyable, and I think it has a high rewatch value.

            "content": "Noragami, being a supernatural series, was the first in my list of must-watch episodes only because of one reason: my friend wanted to watch it.\r\nI had no idea how the anime was going to be, because I did not read the manga. From observing the net about both the sources I found there was not much hype  about Noragami being aired. The only thing that drove me to watch was the cast-with Kamiya Hiroshi and Yuki Kaji as the main leads, I decided there was no way I was going to miss this and boy am I glad I watched it fully, even takingthe time to re-watch it two to three times.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that attracted me during the very first episode was, undoubtedly, Yato. I could swear to god that he is one of the most dynamic and best characters I have seen in anime history. He was like Lelouch, yet at the same time, he was funny. Despite being a God, you could say he was vey un-god-like, but this is exactly why this character was good and extremely funny. Understanding his character can be done only when one watches the series, and coupled with his voice actor, Hiroshi Kamiya, Yato was the man of the show for me. \\n\\n\r\nHiyori Iki was also in my list of favorite characters for one, major reason: she was NOT ANNOYING. Unlike other heroines in shounen anime where the girls are either too arrogant or too shy, Iki was the correct example of how a girl actually could play an important part in the anime. There were other characters I loved too- Kazuma, Bishamon and Yukine were perfect side characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is something that can be executed nicely, and it has indeed played itself well. I like good, sensible and logical anime that have supernatural elements along with these aspects. However, it does not loyally follow the manga during the last episodes, and it turned out to be somewhat disappointing because adding a new character just for the sake of finishing the anime was something I do not support in any anime. It certainly would have been nice if the episodes were extended a little, that would have helped the anime to be more faithful to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, as usual, was brilliant, as expected of Eureka Seven's producer, Bones. The scenes where Yato summons Yukine, coupled with the music, were amazing to watch, except they were used repetitively. Yato's design was attractive, and the whole anime was in the manga's style.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked more than the art, though, was the music. There were some themes that sounded very absurd, yet, they were addictive and nice to hear, such as the theme called \"Harmony\" where a high-pitched voice sings something called a \"sangathi\", which is a very famous style of singing in South India(yes, being a south Indian, I am very familiar with the sound). The main theme used autotune but was a liitle lacking in the sense that it was repetitive. I liked the opening theme, \"Goya No Machiawase\" by Hello Sleepwalkers, as the tune was catchy and addicting. I did not give much attention to the ending song as it was quite boring and gave a gloomy feeling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series very much and would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch supernatural elements with drama. \\n\r\nThank you for reading my first review.",

            "content": "I\u2019m going to review this first season of Noragami as if it were a separate entity from the second one, even though I\u2019m uncertain whether that\u2019s a good idea. The first season functions mostly as exposition for the second one, but it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been served, so let\u2019s get down to business.\r\nNoragami is a show that struggles to do a lot of things right, but fails at most.\r\nIts cast of characters is derived from something that\u2019ll feel familiar to you if you\u2019ve watched at least some anime before this. There\u2019s the charismatic, goofy lead with a hidden dark side, the I-have-as-much-personality-as-a-blank-sheet-of-paper female lead, the troublesomekid that pisses everyone of, the wise old dude, the bikini hot chick, the moe girl, the tough guy... You get where this is going. I don\u2019t have anything against stereotypical characters if the show used its time to make them more than that, which it sadly doesn\u2019t. The lack of depth and any significant development gets apparent towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters being a bit to far on the bland side would not be much of an issue if the show had a plot able to back them up, which (you guessed it) it does not. It struggles to lay out its exposition and at the same give the characters something to do. That amounts to a plot that can best be described as: \u201ccharacters running around, doing nothing\u201d. Again, a plot that doesn\u2019t stick to usual story tropes isn\u2019t an issue. What is, is that Noragami doesn\u2019t really do much to help it be more than a lackluster mess. The plot could\u2019ve been overlooked if the characters were able to get it out of the gutter, and vice versa, and you get where this is going as well.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, some characters do get developed. However, the show chooses the most roundabout way to do that. A lot of problems could\u2019ve been avoided if the characters sat down and talked to each other like regular human beings. Saying that they\u2019re all confused teenagers isn\u2019t a good excuse. The show didn\u2019t need to shove a monster fight in my face every episode to be appealing. What it lacks is a little bit of substantial dialog and some common sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great and there\u2019s not much to complain in that compartment. If I were to say anything it\u2019s that the character and monster designs aren\u2019t anything revolutionary. On a side note, whoever thought that dressing the main lead in a tracksuit with some boots on and a dirty old rag to go along with them should get their ass fired immediately.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are nicely animated. The songs didn\u2019t really stick in my head, but they might in yours. The show\u2019s overall music is fine, but in the long run forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Noragami is your average action-packed anime. If you\u2019re just a simple viewer as myself and haven\u2019t read the manga, there\u2019s not much here to look at. If Japanese gods in the modern society are your thing, you could give it a try, but you\u2019re probably better of with something else.\\n",

            "content": "One word to describe this anime: Bland. It is popcorn fluff that tries its hardest and succeeds at being neither terribly creative nor terribly offensive. I have seen quite a few reviews on here lauding it as the greatest anime ever created and even a few calling it the worst ever. I agree with neither of these, the show is merely Studio Bones or whoever made it trying to fill in the space between airings of larger more developed projects.\r\nThe Story 2/10\r\nIf you have ever seen a fluff anime before you already know what the story is going to be, girl meets boy. Girl fallsfor boy, something gets in the way, boy basically admits to being in love with her, is empowered to stay the same to be with her and finally he beats the bad guy. The side stories never go on for long enough to be boring and distract from the main story, or interesting enough to make you want to see more about it. The characters (which we\u2019ll get to later) have some ability to grow, but it is stifled by the short run of the show and the desire to keep the show as bland and fluffy as possible; the final scene of the show hints at more to come in a season that will never come.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation is fine; I never found it distracting I know little to nothing about animation. From what I can surmise it was not poor enough to keep me from enjoying the show nor impressive enough to merit any special credit from me. If you liked the animation style from Code Geass, you\u2019ll probably like this style also.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound 7/10\\n\r\nThe sounds are fine. The voice acting was pretty good, there wasn\u2019t really much need to really test voice actors as just about nothing happened the whole anime, but they were overall pretty good. The intro and ending songs were pretty good on their own, but didn\u2019t fit as well as I would have liked with this type of anime, however in keeping with the theme of basically this whole review it wasn\u2019t overly offensive and didn\u2019t really merit any special attention. Just listen to it and judge for yourself:\\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD7OlVs_pRI\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are flat. They don\u2019t evolve at all throughout the course of the entire anime. When they do grow the slightest amount it feels forced, and the character you are left dealing with doesn\u2019t even seem like the character you\u2019ve been watching for the past ten episodes. Another problem this anime suffers from relating to this is the effective white-washing of all of its characters into this blob of good and evil characters. It almost seems like the writer thought up all of the characters in the beginning, set up whole arcs for them to explore and evolve and then at some point in the implementation of the show, someone from up top showed up and said that\u2019s all cool and stuff but I need this this and this in the show, and you only have this long to do it in. This meant that that deep back-story the writer had planned where the character evolves over the course of ten episodes had to be cut down to 1 and now he had a goal to meet for his character.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this being said, however, I find it much more important that an audience be able to relate to and fall in love with the characters in the show, and this show does that impeccably. While they may not have been deep by the end, it was hard to not fall in love with the characters in the show, and there is something to be said about that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nDespite the show\u2019s obvious downfalls, I definitely say the fluff is well worth watching at least once. It won\u2019t change the way you think about anything or really stick out in any way when you try thinking back to it later, but mind-numbing popcorn blandness is good for you every once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nOverall, this show is nothing special; enjoyable with fun to watch characters no doubt, but not worth the time if you\u2019re looking for anything more than something to pass the time watching. I doubt I\u2019ll ever want to rewatch it a later point in time or even that I\u2019ll be able to remember the name of it, but I don\u2019t regret sitting down to watch this enjoyable waste of time.",

            "content": "Yato is portrayed as a jersey-wearing young boy of about high school age, and so is his problems and mannerisms at first glance like any other high school boy, doing odd jobs for 5 yen is what he thinks will enable him to get followers and get him his own shrine someday. Despite all these appearances Yato\u2019s character doesn\u2019t seem to be as shallow as most protagonists\u2019 are seen having a lot in these kind of comedy-centric anime...use to being a God of Calamity during the war Yato\u2019s personality seems to be pretty dark as well as wise. The support characters Yukine, Yato\u2019s shinkiand a human girl named Hiyori----who seems to have gained a strange property after coming in contact with Yato, which further drags her into unlikely situations--- seems to have complemented the Stray-yet-fascinating-God\u2019s characteristics well. Yukine\u2019s character first portrayed and then developed along the progression of the series is really an eye-catching thing and Hiyori\u2019s adventures in the medium of Gods despite being a normal girl is just the average requirement for attracting anime fans since its been done in different anime since a long time back...Special mention of Nora and Rabo can made here due to their contrasting personalities which is another plus point since it is the antagonists\u2019 personalities which usually attract fans in most anime.\\n\\n\r\nSummary: Anime made on God, there are a lot of them out there, good ones and the bad ones but the idea of using something like religion and giving it a twist for people of varying ages to enjoy, just doesn\u2019t seem to die...so from that box came out yet another jack...the name being called Noragami. Basically the word Nora refers to Stray and Gami refers to God so the name stands something like Stray-God in English...the name itself is very innovative and strange yet seems to express a lot of things about this anime in just one word.... Overall through its animation and story-telling Noragami seems to have hit all the right marks. Bones seems to be back on track through it.... An anime with a mixture of supernatural yet attracting gimmicks for the ones who stays above these genres seems to be what Noragami is and it would probably end up in the list of one of the good oldies that foretold the development of anime in visual and aural aspects in the years to come...\\n",

            "content": "Before I review Noragami I want to just say that this review is my opinion so that you may not agree.\r\nReview:\r\nNoragami is one of my favorite anime I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of anime. My anime list is small only because I have just decided to do this. Anyway this is beside the point. Starting with the intro I want to say that it's rare for me to find a intro that I like because to me the intro has to sound good but the intro's animation has to be good and more importantly the song has to fit theanime. Example if you have some death metal song for a light hearted romance anime it's not gonna be a good intro. In Noragami's case this intro is excellently done. Next has to be the anime itself. As a whole it's very well made with a really intriguing story about gods and goddesses living throughout the world trying to grant wishes. One of the MC, the god of calamity, Yato is very interesting and hilarious. Next is Yukine who works with Yato. He is an adolescent kid and usually I hate brats in anime but his character is done so well I enjoy most scenes with him. Notice how I say most. One thing I have a problem with anime is that I get pissed off at them for example when stupid things happen that can be easily resolved but the characters decided to do it the hardest way possible to get it done in which for Noragami this is the case. But in the end even when I was irritated at the show it kept me coming back and it kept me watching, not fast forwarding till something interesting happens. The whole show got me interested. This concludes my review for Noragami. Thank you for reading and if you decide to check out this anime I hope you enjoy it.",

            "content": "Noragami was good; I liked it. However, I'm not blind to its flaws - and there were quite a few of them. The biggest problem was the overarching storyline that existed throughout the whole season: it was barely there. Blink and you will miss it. Therefore once the \"main\" conflict came into play, it felt random and disrupted the flow of Noragami. I was confused, lost and wondering what I had missed. The problem could have been avoided if the pacing of the show had been faster as it would have allowed for more plot development in a twelve episode show. Sometimes, whole episodes werededicated to an introduction of a character (for example, the episode that introduces Kofuku) whilst completely ignoring the overarching storyline. Their should have been more relation to the overarching plot in the other arcs that were explored throughout the series. The again, the problem might just lie with the fact that the storyline itself doesn't exist in the manga which is why it felt so disruptive to Noragami's framework. \\n\\n\r\nSaying that, I did really enjoy the separate arcs of Noragami - especially Yukine's arc which was beautifully executed. They really captured the feel that Noragami was going for, even though the main plot was somewhat disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nNoragami is definitely a character-driven anime rather than a plot driven one. This is most prevalent due to the fact that one of the main arcs of the show focuses on Yukine's redemption and acceptance of his death. Also, a lot of time is spent on the development of the trio's relationship with each other which is something I appreciated because the audience was able to see how the characters developed in relation to the dynamic they have with one another. Individually, Hiyori, Yato, Yukine are all quite well developed and their personalities are well established from the beginning through their actions and mannerisms. There isn't much original about them, but they aren't one dimensional or generic (you can lack orginality and still not be as boring as cardboard). I was also surprised at how well-developed supporting characters like Kofuku and Nora are - we got a real idea  of their personalities despite them not appearing as often as our trio. The characters are definitely one of the strongest aspects of Noragami.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, as well, is beautiful. Noragami has been sitting on my list for a while, but I didn't decide to actually watch it until I saw GIFs of the fights and Yato's magnificent eyes. His eyes are beautiful, not only aesthetically, but also emotionally. The animators express a lot of what Yato feels and his nuances through the shape of his pupils and the shine in those glowing blue eyes. Yeah, I have a huge fascination with Yato's eyes.\\n\r\nErm, I don't really pay attention to the music in the background of an anime - especially one like Noragami - because it tends to be your usual stock rock music in a fight scene or a piano sonata in an emotional scene. However, I will say that the opening theme for Noragami was awesome (and I'm somewhat upset that I they changed it for season 2).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, although Noragami had its flaws it didn't stop me from wanting more. I was glad I got more because season 2 is a big step-up from season 1 (and shall be reviewed shortly).\\n\\n",

            "content": "What is it about this anime that makes it stands out like an absolute gem?\r\nNoragami (Stray God) is about \r\nYato, a minor god (fast, affordable and reliable!), who is trying his hardest to get people to believe in him.\r\nHiyori, an average high-school who, due to a freak accident, gains the ability to slip out of her body into spirit form.\r\nYukine, Yato's shinki (Regalia), or sacred weapon, a troubled fourteen-year-old.\r\nCharacters\r\nCharacters are superb, Yato is the perfect mixture of hopeless, charming and cool. Hiyori (now I could go on about her), for once you get a heroine who isn't the damsel in distress! She is the gluethat makes the characters work and is herself, sweet, determined and likeable. Sometimes she can be a bit too upstanding, and there's almost some hero-worship going on with yato/yukine and her, but a more likeable heroine I've yet to see.\\n\r\nNow Yukine, rebellious, frustrating but so, so relatable. \\n\\n\r\nKofuku and Daikoku are just love.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThis anime doesn't just provide some entertaining, super-cool fight scenes (with AWESOME soundtrack), it focuses so much on cherishing what you have. Shinkis are human souls taken before their time and not able to interact with the world around them.Troubling as that would be for anyone, they cannot fall into despair because of it. I'm not entirely sure about the precision of the morality in this show-how are shinkis expected to behave? How do you control your thinking? The banishment of one of Tenjin's shinki (not a spoiler) was one of the defining moments for me as it raises so many questions the most prominent being: where is the line drawn? When does -sin- begin?\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nCoolest soundtrack ever! Fight scenes are amazing and the music gets you excited.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nSee (music). The art can possibly be called non-nondescript as it has nothing that sets it apart from other average anime, but it doesn't need that. It is very pretty in a normal way and very fluid. Perhaps what makes it stand out is the way it is so perfectly normal, not too cute, not too airy fairy, not to dark, not too spiky (running out of adjectives here).\\n\\n\r\nAnd have I mentioned how cool the fight scenes are??\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch only one anime this season, make it this one.\\n\\n",
