            "content": "Seeing as how hilarious this show is, I'm really surprised there are no reviews for it yet. Usually there are 10 reviews for any given show that's only a couple of episodes in. Same goes for the relatively low score. My guess is it's because of the art style that many people seem to be turned off by. Don't be mislead however, as this is by far the funniest thing to happen to anime this season.\r\nStory - It's really difficult to describe a show based on only a few episodes, but Mitsudomoe doesn't really need a full season's worth of episodes for that. The animeis gag driven, much like Azumanga Daioh. Each episode works as a standalone one, divided into multiple mini gag-based plots. That's not to say that there is no long term plot throughout the series, because there is. The story revolves around a male teacher, who begins his new career teaching a middle school class that contains the troublesome Marui triplets. There is also a clumsy school nurse that he falls in love with at the beginning. This love progresses, if you could even call it progress, as the episodes go on. Primarily though, the show is about the triplets and their teacher getting into all manner of hilarious circumstances, often involving the classmates and the school nurse. Beware however, since Mitsudomoe is adult humor driven much of the time.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - The first thing you might notice is that the art is reminiscent of Azumanga, particularly the heads. Unlike most of the anime released, it does not rely on the more realistic design approach, instead opting for the super cute. This suits Mitsudomoe perfectly in my opinion, since it amplifies the hilarity of many of the circumstances. In episode 3 you're introduced to the triplets' father, who is drawn in a rough/sketchy style. I find it makes for a funny contrast between him and everyone else. The animation is fluid and consistent in terms of quality, with often exaggerated expressions for added comedic effect. This works seamlessly in my opinion. \\n\r\nAs for the bg art, there isn't really much to say other than that it's drawn to compliment the simple character designs. The bg coloring is appealing with a muted palette, which sometimes exhibits a slightly marker rendered look.\\n\\n\r\nSound - This is where many shows fall flat in, typically not having anything praise worthy. The seiyuu's are noteworthy, especially Tomatsu Haruka (known for voicing Lala Deviluke from To LOVE-Ru) and Shimono Hiro (known for voicing Akihisa Yoshii from Baka To Test). The voice work is well done and brings out the characters' personalities really well. The sfx and atmospheric music also deserve to be praised, since they play an important role in the comedy. There are some truly hilarious sfx here and music that cues in at just the right time. The blood draining sound is especially amusing.\\n\r\nThe OP also deserves mentioning for its cute and catchy tune.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - We have the 3 Marui sisters, Yabe-sensei (main teacher), Kuriyama-sensei (school nurse), as well as many side characters that are introduced in more detail through various points in the story. The triplets consist of Futaba who is the perverted muscle girl, Hitoha who is the dark and gloomy one, and Mitsuba who is the sadistic type as well as the self proclaimed king of the class. The inexperienced, newly transferred teacher and super clumsy school nurse round out the main characters. There is also the father of the Marui sisters, who looks like a big, creepy pervert. I'd also mention all the other secondary characters, but I'd need a lot more space to describe them all. Needless to say, they all have their own unique personalities that get their spotlight as the anime progresses. Overall, a great and entertaining assortment of characters make up Mitsudomoe.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I'm loving this! Simple as that. Sometimes gag based shows are needed to change the pace and this manages to do just that for me. The relationship between the triplets and everyone around them is entertaining and I can't help but cheer up after watching each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - If you loved Azumanga Daioh, then you will probably like this. Keep in mind that even though Mitsudomoe has a very innocent air about it, it is meant for a more mature audience largely because of the adult humor. If you can appreciate humor the way I do, but at the same time are not easily turned off by the cute art style or the adult themes, then give Mitsudomoe a serious consideration. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "Mitsudomoe is the stupidest anime I have ever had the good fortune to see. The premise is clich\u00e9; the everyday life of three very unique sisters. The art is awful and follows a long line of under-budget slice-of-life comedies that always end up in your computer's recycling bin after viewing. But by some miracle, Mistudomoe is fresh and funny, and will always leave you craving for another episode. What Mistudomoe also is though, is vulgar. It's rude and frequently disgusting, idiotic and atrocious, and violent and inappropriate in any way it can be. That being said you should easily be able to tell it's oneof the funniest things on TV.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nYabe-sensei is class 6-3's new teacher. His class appears normal and easy-going at first, but then to his dismay, he has to control all three of the craaaaziest kids in school who just HAPPEN to be triplet sisters. The Marui triplets run amok through the school and cause everyone problems everywhere. Now, that's about it for the actual story, but whatever segment you watch in Mistudomoe always ends up being laugh out loud funny by the end. The jokes rely a lot on misunderstandings, running gags, and dirty humor. For example, the Marui's father is drawn with a thick black line around him, and the line makes him look extra suspicious. How is this supposed to be funny? Anytime their father tries to do something for them he always ends up getting arrested by the cops. Eventually the joke becomes so frequent you have dialogue like \"Sorry girls, I was late because I was arrested three times on the way here.\" If you've a certain disdain for bathroom humor, I would not recommend this. There were actually a few scenes that made me so sick I almost gagged myself (a shining example is the episode in which the nurse accidentally spills everyone in the schools urine samples on the ground).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nOh, well, it's bad. If you're watching Mistudomoe then the visuals aren't your top priority. It looks very basic and some would as far to say it looks generic - but oh the reaction faces. Even if what just happened in the anime wasn't funny, if Futaba (the middle sister) does her euphoric \"my brain is dead\" face I'd laugh. The emotion that comes out of the characters faces definitely increases the quality of the humor and characters. The art style works for what kind of anime this is, but I think many things could have been improved upon, and if Mistudomoe were re-done the thing that I would ask be worked would be the backgrounds, CG, and overall fluidity of animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great! The very main cast was voiced by some pretty obscure folks, the most well known one, who voiced Nagi in Kannagi, is Tomatsu Haruka, who voices Hitoha (the youngest sister) in Mistudomoe. The side cast is blooming with stars, including Aki Toyosaki (Yui from K-ON!), Inoue Kikuko (Lust from FMA:B), Saito Chiwa (Aika from Aria), and last but not least, Chihara Minori who voices Yuki in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the musical portion. The opening instantly caught me off guard, all three girls of the main cast could sing so well! The singing and dancing set you up for an exciting episode every time - not once did I skip the opening song. The ending song was rather unfitting though. It's a slow almost melancholic song that doesn't really seem right until the very last episode. Then there's the BGM. Always supplying a chuckle the music ranges from parodies of talk shows to classical music pieces played in incredibly unfitting ways. Since this show uses a lot of slapstick, the sound effects are also an important part. I found the noises that came from whatever always top notch (the blood leaking noises were so silly I got hearty laugh the first time it happened).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe \"three stooges\" concept has been in media for quite a long time and has become so frequent that it's become clich\u00e9. I started watching Mistudomoe expecting some ridiculous corny character archetypes, and I kinda got exactly that. No there's not a lot of character development, no changes over time, no sudden changes in character, and so on. What Mitsudomoe has that other shows lack is the application of such poor designs into being jokes themselves. I've already explained the storyline - and if you take it for face value - it's horrendous. Now if you were to take the storyline and combine it with a colorful cast of different personalities bumping back and forth into each other, you'd have something much more interesting. Each side character has his or her little own story, and after the point that they have been introduced they fall back into being side characters - but the thing is that now they keep adding to the story. Whereas the usual slice of life would have episodic episodes of characters and then you'd never see them again, Mistudomoe repeatedly brings back the same characters again and again making a refreshing feel every time they come back.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast includes the sadistic eldest sister, Mistuba, the perverted middle sister Futaba, and the introverted youngest sister Hitoha. Their teacher is an unlucky geek, their dad is loving fellow easily mistaken as a pedophile, and their friends are plentiful. There's the pervert, the nice kid mistaken as a pervert, his three female stalkers, the rival girl and her clique, the romantic, the occult freak, the hamster named nipples and the monkey faced kid. The best part about this anime is seeing how each character interacts with another, and every time they do, something ridiculous happens.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI laughed so hard I got sick and had to go to bed for over 14 hours to recover. Or well, maybe I was sick and the laughing triggered my allergies and then I kept coughing until I had to lie down and go to sleep.\\n\\n\r\nWant an interesting approach to something that has already been done, and want it from a viewpoint where it hacks the slice of life genre to pieces? Mitsudomoe should hit right home. The thing is though, if you didn't listen to warning at the beginning of this review about vulgarity and stupid humor then you're going to hate this. Hate it a lot. This is not an anime to be viewed for it's cutesy moments so abundant in slice of life (although it does has some), it's meant to be a hilarious attempt to get revenge upon the predictable slice of life genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIn short, Mitsudomoe is both great and awful. Plot wise, it's no better than the worst of anime, but the common misconception is that Mitsudomoe is an anime that is dependent on it's jokes for goodness, not it's riveting storyline (for it has none). The way the characters collide with such wit kept my full attention, while the chance of seeing it again kept me watching. The slapstick might not be for everyone though, it's sure to turn off a fair amount of people and I think that's a shame, because I really enjoyed this anime. So if you're interested in a good laugh, just throw on any episode of Mitsudomoe and have at it.",

            "content": "\"Did you think all kids are pure? Think again\" - Me\r\nThose phrases are the best word to describe this anime,anyway  Mitsudomoe is your funny and eccentric anime that you wouldn't find in anywhere. If there was anime that something like this, it would be Azumanga Daioh. This anime suprisingly is EXTREMELY funny, i am not exaggerate it, but it really does. beside of the awful art and average sounding, This anime gives some fresh jokes, not like the other comedy-gag anime which is usually really pushes the jokes, repetitive and even nothing funny at all. Thanks to the god, this anime wasn't like that.\r\nMitsudomoeis not all-age-gag-anime, i am must saying this again NOT-ALL-AGE-GAG-ANIME. since there is so much mature material that involves in this anime. Dont judge the anime just because of the covers. and it applies for this anime, It maybe like an anime for kids since this anime was all about kids and their activity in school. If you had thinking like that, then you have made a mistake. If Azumanga Daioh or Nichijou focus on how cute, pure and clumsy child is, then it Mitsudomoe is the \"EVIL version\" of them. Mitsudomoe jokes are literally a kind of adult jokes like Seitokai Yakuindomo, If Seitokai Yakuindomo usually use \"vulgar\" jokes then Mitsudomoe more less than that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in  Mitsudomoe is about The 11-year-old Marui triplets, yeah TRIPLETS. that being known as the most problematic kids in the school, and unluckily, Satoshi Yabe, the newly graduated teacher must led the class that have the trouble maker triplets.\\n\\n\r\nSince this anime is a gag anime, so, it doesnt have any main story or main goal. Usually their story in each episode are standalone, and from each episode, it usually consists of  mini gag-story like Danshi koukoushei no Nichijou. and its really usual for a gag anime that they use this method in their anime so its not surprising, If we're talking a gag anime, of course the story is not their main priority, the main focus of a gag anime is jokes. No matter how good their art, sound, or story is, if the jokes wasnt funny then its not a gag anime. So, the main question is, Is Mitsudomoe amusing to watch? For me, Yes it is.\\n\\n\r\nLike what i said before, Art is not the main priority in a gag. So does in Mitsudomoe. The weakest section of this anime are in art, but, for me is not something that we would critize at. Furthermore, there is something special in Mitsudomoe's art. Like how different between the triplet father with other character (The triplet father is being drawn differently with the other character). and do not miss the comedic effect too (like the funny expression that the character does or overly reaction to something). Something like comedic effect is usually intend to make the anime more funnier and sometimes to cover the lack in art section (See how Seto no Hanayome works) and with that method, its really work in Mitsudomoe.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, there isnt something that really prominent, but how the each character respond the jokes are really amazing. The timing between their jokes and how they respond is really hit the spot.Especially Yabe Satoshi. Well, if you hear carefully you will realize that the seiyuu (Hiro Shimono) is an expert about this one (respond on the jokes) are the seiyuu for Akihisa from baka to test which we known are always use \"respond\" jokes and exaggerate respond. and for the OP and the ED, i didnt really notice it, since its just some catchy-child tones that i dont really like it. But how this story was about, its really fits with the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to Character section, the main character in Mitsudomoe is the triplets marui and the new graduated teacher, Yabe Satoshi. for the triplets, there is Marui Mitsuba, Marui Futaba, and Marui Hitoha.\\n\\n\r\nMarui Mitsuba is the eldest sister between three of them, she is someone who likes to torturing people or we can call the sadistic one. But for the eldest, she is somehow care for her younger sisters even she is didnt show it openly. She has obsession with being a king and more she proclaimed that she is a mature even though no people are really care about it.\\n\\n\r\nMarui Futaba is the second daughter in Marui triplets, she has a weird obsession and it was Boobs (yeah, a 11 YEARS old that has obsession with boobs), even she was like that, she is so athletic errr... not athletic maybe the words that fits with her is \"superhero power\". She is able to destroy wall, table, or doors without any sweats and even she can run more faster than a scooter. Even she is strong like a superhero, she is kinda clumsy.\\n\\n\r\nMarui Hitoha, the youngest sister in Marui Triplets, my favorite character. She is a taciturn girl which always carries a \"glory\" books. What i mean in glory book is PORN magazine. beside of her emotionless, introvert and taciturn. She is a being feared by the other sisters and even the other sisters not dare to make her angry.\\n\\n\r\nYabe Satoshi, is the homeroom teacher for the triplets. He always being a victim of the triplets. Not too much known for this character, since he was too normal for main character, maybe like Shinpachi from gintama.\\n\\n\r\nSummary, every character in Mitsudomoe have their own unique personalities, from the one that really perverted, the one that has obsession with supernatural things, even into a several girls who claimed as the Hopeless squad. With each their uniqueness, it brings Mitsudomoe into a bunch of people with their unique personalities, and for me, its really amusing to watch all of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last, Mitsudomoe is something unique and keeps the viewer to watch it, with all the randomness that happen and all the unique personalities that all of the character have, you mustn't miss this funny anime. This anime always makes me laughing from the first episode to the last episode. I really recommend this.\\n\\n\r\nCritize, comments, or any feedbacks are welcome. :)\\n\\n",

Today, we shall be reviewing the series: Mitsudomoe!\r\nStory: While the whole loli's harrassing teacher plot is alittle over used, I still love this type of plot, so I give it a 10. \r\nArt: I really love the art style alot. It's so cute yet detailed.\r\nSound: I really like the opening song. The ending one is pretty good too, but not really my cup of tea. The voice actors sound epic, too.\r\nCharacters: There's Mitsuba, my favorite, who is the oldest, and kinda mean to all the other characters, but still somewhat shy and lovable. Futaba, the natural airhead who'samazingly strong and almost always happy. And Hitoha, the somewhat demonic emotionless loli. Then there are side characters and teachers that I won't bother with.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment and overall: This was a cute and funny series, but not reccomended for people who like more \"All ages\" type of jokes. If you don't mind somewhat gross and perverted humor, then you may like this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Story:\r\nIt is about three elementary school triplets that have three very different personalities and a teacher who teaches all of them. However sadly the teacher barely had any role in this show which would probably have made it much funnier. Near the end the jokes get tiring as they are repetitive.\r\nArt:\r\nAnimation is sufficient. The girls are cute enough, the exaggerations for comedic effect were well executed, however predictable and repetitive.  If you are into the cute elementary school animation then you will appreciate it, however if you are one of those that absolutely despise the cutesy animation then this is not for you towatch.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBackground music is bearable. They could have really used less silences, because at some points of the show, it just got boring without any background music. (This is hard to notice though unless you pay attention it) The opening song though is very good, and I love the chorus with the dance. Cheers me right up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe highlight of the show is the very defined characters, each with their own stereotypical personalities. Once again, it did get repetitive, but there were a diverse amount of characters to show sufficient originality in terms of the comedy of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really am a sucker for comedies such as these. However the problem with this is that the comedy was not very original, and almost every joke was a dirty joke, so you could practically predict every punchline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis is not something that you must watch, but more of something you watch if you are extremely bored. It is not a show to marathon, but to spread out over a long time period so you might forget a joke that they are planning to use again. You might look at this review and think that a 6 is really low, however given that a 5 is average, this show is indeed above average.",

            "content": "now as you are reading this and seeing that i gave this anime a 10, you maybe thinking that i really overrate this anime or that i'm really lenient when scoring there things. well maybe you're right, maybe i do give out too many 10s. but that because i think it really deserves it. and here why\r\nstory- 9\r\nthe story most revolved around the three sisters, Futaba, Hitoha, and Mitsuba. at first i thought it would circle around the teacher yabe, which it didn't and that made me glad since he was kinda of dull and whinny. now every episode of this series has a style,like Azumanga, where is it like a random scene then it transition to another scene and each episode has like 4 or 5. as you know random scene does not make a complex story and i'm ok with that as long as it make me laugh and it sure does. ok i will say this now. 80 to 90% of this anime's joke come from misunderstanding. i really love it but if you hate joke like this then i recommend you stay way from it. the only problem is that if there it gets a little repetitive since they use it a lot and i guarantee if they had 26 episodes instead of 13 then the these joke would get stale and old by like 18\\n\\n\r\nart- 8\\n\r\nthe art was good nice and colorful. the only complain for me would be that the animation look like it appeals more to kid when it is aiming for teen. and there is a lot of perverted thing in this anime that kid should not see.\\n\\n\r\nsound-10\\n\r\nnow i'm going to talk about the opening only since i did not listen to the end and i really don't worry about voice acting as long as it not really horrible or bad. the opening was so awesome that i never skipped it. every week i see this anime i love to always hear that song. it was catchy, upbeat, and had 3 (don't know ,but sound like 3) great sings behind. the video was good too. i laugh hard when i saw futaba break that desk the first time i saw it and i never got tire of seeing this.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter-10\\n\r\nnow if you know me (which many of you don't) you know that i think character are the backbone of any good anime and i say \"now\" a lot. i think this. i mean if someone make the all time greatest action story of all time with a lot of explosion and then the main character are the Alvin and the chimp muck guys. would you see. shit no you wouldn't. now getting back on topic this anime each of the sister  is unique and funny. hell even the minor character are funny too. futaba is superman strong but lack a IQ point. she is also very fond of the chesty area. hitoha( my favorite character) is a very shy person but can be very scary since she has the ability to turn into the girl from the ring. and finally mitsuba who love hurting other and think she is better than other but sometime she can be nice which really count.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment- 10\\n\r\nnow out of all the anime i watch for the summer season i think this has to be the best. every week when i watch anime this is the first to be pick and i love waiting for it to come out. it was really great with awesome character and the great opening. it really deserves this 10\\n\\n\r\noverall-10\\n\r\nyou maybe questioning my math right now saying \"9+8+10+10+10 is not 10 it is 9.4 which is close to 9\". and you are right but i disregard the laws of math and make it 10. JUST KIDDING.  i'm not the type to grade to harsh or exact. i'm the type to forgive a little (especially the skypier arc in one  piece that shit was long) since i really like it. and now THAT IS ALL",

I wanted to be self-righteous ...\r\nBut I can't do it.  I can't because ... this is one of the funniest animes I have seen in a long, long while!\r\nYou'll feel guilty laughing and you'll constantly look over your shoulder to make sure no one sees you but you wont be able to help it!\r\nThis is a series that is probably best described as the messy end result after a car crash involving Minami-ke, Nichijou andKyou no Go no Ni.  It combines three sisters with hugely different personalities with zany comedy and light perversion in a elementary school setting.\\n\\n\r\nTo say there is no plot would be an understatement but you wouldn't be looking for one if you were considering watching this in the first place.  What makes this series so humorous are the characters which are extreme to say the least!  The interactions of the three sisters with one another and the sensei will have you laughing out loud in every episode guaranteed.  It is further enriched with the varied support cast, all of whom contribute to the ridiculous comedy.  The situations are crude, bordering on criminal but just prevents it self from going too far.  I wont say too much for risk of spoiling it but watch a random episode and you will see what I mean. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is further enhanced with the catchy opening theme, a rather surprising melodic ending theme and with the stellar seiyu cast including Haruka Tomatsu,  Hiro Shimono, Chiwa Saito and a cameo from the ever eternal Kikuko Inoue. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a great series to watch if you want a break from the more serious series out there.  I've watched it in between Bokurano and Monster, which has allowed me to slow my heart down a little!\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended!",

I have been watching anime for 25 or so years and this is one of the funniest ones yet.  \r\nThe Marui triplets are either dangerous or insane.  I feel sorry for their homeroom teacher that has to watch after them.  It is gag-based and it works.  Some animes just can't pull this off.\r\nThe animation I thought is pretty good.  Note: I have seen some really bad animes in the past.  But that is the evolution of anime.\r\nI am only on episode 4 soit could get worse.  We shall see in the next few months.\\n\r\nWatch and enjoy.  Make sure you are eating or drinking anything while watching the exploits of the Marui triplets, you may just have to clean up a big mess.\\n\\n\\n\r\nfollow me on twitter: anime_guru\\n\\n",

            "content": "As a fan of comedy and slice of life anime, I am pretty surprised at how well-received this anime is. I just didn't find it very funny - for the most part it just grossed me out.\r\nThe story? Well this isn't a story-based anime. It's a slice of life comedy, so calling it out on its lack of story would be foolish. The idea is that a nervous new teacher has a class of bratty children to deal with, including three sisters who are sure to give him a hard time. \"Hilarity\" ensues.\r\nThe art and sound are both sub-par. Which is unsurprising from the forgettablestudio Bridge. I dislike the character designs a lot. They are very unappealing in that they aren't at all cute. They are sort of comedic with some occasionally funny expressions, but not exceedingly. I'm no expert on OST but this left on impression on me whatsoever. The OP is... alright at capturing the tone of the show. So yeah, it's pretty grating and not very listenable. I have no issues with the voice acting - there are a few big name seiyuu's but none of the voices I heard left much of an impression.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters, I am not a fan either. Some of them have okay personalities, or at least personalities that clearly fit what archetype they should be. But the character comedy was weak. The tropes were set in stone and just sort of acted accordingly. This can be done well but the characters themselves were just not likeable for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe teacher is forgettable and just sort of has no spine. He lacks personality. The sisters - I actually find all of them annoying. One is a real himedere, and likes seeing others suffer - but she's often downtrodden herself. Then there is the airheaded one who is also very strong. She is also mostly a nice person, but then is inconsiderate sometimes too? She had the most potential to be likeable, but between doing some physically gross things and just not being helpful I couldn't warm to her. The youngest sister is the worst. She's got a very dark aura, but not in a brilliant relate-able way like Tomoko Kuroki from Watamote for example. She's just sort of... terrible. A very unpleasant character. Other supporting characters are mostly forgettable and not likeable. The boys are pretty much just perverts which is... ugh. And there is the new school nurse who is just a ditz. In a very over-the-top and annoying way. She's absolutely useless, and it goes too far to be funny. I just wound up disliking her. She's also part of the most disgusting scene ever - let's just say it involves urine.\\n\\n\r\nNow I know it seems that I have been overly-critical of these 11-year old characters. After all, they are kids. Kids are supposed to be bratty. Well... Sure. But maybe in a less vulgar way? And maybe they shouldn't all be so consistently irritating? I'm not saying they necessarily had to be cute, but they REALLY weren't cute. At all. They are about as un-cute as it gets. And yet, there are all of these swimming pool scenes, various scenes about getting a bra and boys being interested - I don't really like this aspect of it either. It felt weird to me. I know they aren't babies so it's not exactly unreasonable, but I just couldn't get enjoyment over that stuff that happens in the class at all. Again, a lot of this would be forgivable or maybe even a good thing if it was actually funny. But for me, it just wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nI may have touched on this, but my personal enjoyment was the problem here. It got barely a couple of chuckles out of me. I think I cringed more while watching it. The jokes were pretty predictable and never really caught me by surprise - except for when it got more unpleasant than I expected it to.\\n\\n\r\nPlease by all means take this review with a pinch of salt from the fact that I've seen so little of the show. But with these kinds of anime with no real plot, that is less of an issue that clouds judgement. I think this anime has too many overly-positive reviews, so just please be warned that this anime might not be as hilarious to you as some are painting it to be.",

This anime was so great i don't really know how to express it, well it made me a fanboy that's for sure, this is exactly what i want from Comedy anime, i laugh so much i had to pause to breath XD\r\nArt- 9/10\r\nThe Art is great, it does not rely on the more realistic design approach, instead opting for the super cute, funny and scary, Hitoha scary scenes are so well done, then you have Futaba destruction scenes and rampage style witch was done so well.\r\nCharacters- 9/10\r\nThe Triplet Sisters are just AWESOME!!!! The youngest is dark and scary, socially awkward but cute and softon the inside, The middle sister is a pervert for boobs, so athletic that she can break walls but easy embarrassed, The eldest sister is sadistic, glutton but worried about her weight, and craves for attention. These combination makes for great and funny scenes that will make you laugh more than you possibly can.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall i had never laugh so much watching anything from movies to tv series, Mitsudomoe is Comedy non-stop, funny stuff one after another, i might be over-rating who knows and who cares it's comedy or you like it or you don't. So i totally recommend this to everyone.\\n\\n",

I rated the \"story\" a five because, let's face it there is no story. Just the three Marui triplets enjoying their everyday life :) And their everyday life just so happens to be the funniest life ever!\r\n     Any ways, I HIGHLY recommend this anime. It's not for children obviously. But it's still awesome! Granted they are young, and a lot of ignorant people call it a \"lolicon\" anime even though theyhaven't watched the show. JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE CHILDREN DOESN'T MAKE IT LOLICON! I mean seriously (-_-) people judge too quickly. Yes, they do draw them kind of erotically sometimes, but the overall script between characters is HILARIOUS. \\n\\n\r\n     Now, let's see....oh yes, the \"art\". The \"art\" was really good. they made all the characters kawaii looking. It might only be me but I love the chibi style animes, they're just so cute! (^.^) Next is sound. Yes I loved the sound. All of it. The music, background noises and panning when necessary. I especially love the \u30b9\u30a4\u30fc  (Suiii) whenever Hitoha walks by and people stare at her! NEXT is characters. All the characters were amazing, all unique in their own way and all of them easy to remember. \\n\\n\r\n     Now my conclusion...Well I enjoyed this anime so much I rated it 10, but if the numbers went higher, I would go even higher than that! It was just such a funny show. Laughed so hard almost all the time!\\n\\n\r\nMy overall rating is of course 10 \"Outstanding!\"\\n\\n\r\nI hope you all enjoyed my review! :)",

It's your slice of life Anime; it follows the lives of 'ordinary' people while throwing real life situations (well, exaggerated ones at least..) at you. I can honestly say that I was kept laughing well through EACH and every episode.\r\nStory? There's not much of a story. Though they do connect with each other slightly, each episode can be watched out of order, and it wouldn't take too long to catch on with what's going on. Seeing as it's a slice of life though,I wouldn't take any regards to a story rating.\\n\\n\r\nThe art worked well for it's genre. The little round faces just made everything all the funnier, while the girls never failed to put on an expression that would send me literally 'LOL'ing at my computer screen. \\n\\n\r\nSounds? Well, it's catchy. I love the voice actors, if it counts for any. The OP songs are incredibly cute and catchy -- you wouldn't expect to watch what you're going to watch from watching the OP. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are your stereotypical 'Tsundere', 'Airhead', and 'Silent' type girls. ...While the males are strung about perverse characteristics (+the one popular boy). \\n\\n\r\nAll this being said, Mitsudomoe is definitely high up on the enjoyment level. Whenever I'm in need for a laugh, Mitsudomoe is there for me. :')",

            "content": "THIS FUCKING SHOW OMG\r\nLet me start by telling you, Iv'e seen my fair share of comedy anime from the satirical take of fantasy genre's like Konosuba, to the Slap stick comedies that is daily life of highschool boys. After watching watching TDLHB i thought there isnt anything funnier than this, im sure, But then i came across mitsudomoe.\r\nokay so right of the bat people looking at the synopsis are gonna think its some moe blob shit with a light hearted tale about these 3 triplets and their teacher. Well its not\r\nThis anime is like the southpark of american television. It has no shame in talkingabout panties, and bra's and straight forward sex jokes in the open without making it weird for the viewers. So if u like that sorta shit, this is for you\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nIts slice of life and comedy, although more comedy than slice of life, but what are you gonna expect. The plot itself is pretty basic, 3 crazy ass triplets in a class full of crazy ass people with a teacher. standard stuff\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nI really dont get why people hate on the art so much, its usually because of the type of art style, I think this type of art style perfectly suited the show. The animation was just as it should be to fit the basic comedy elements in it, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Those facial expressions tho\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nI did particularly like the ost for this series even though they were basic comedic ones. AND THAT 2ND OPENING OMG, its legit in my top ops ever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nAnd damn do i like these characters. Mitsudomoe is primarily on how the characters act with one another in different situations. They've all build unique relationships with each other so it makes it seem like you know them personally sometimes.\\n\r\nSo 1stly we have the triplets, Futoba, Hitoba and Mitsuba, all pretty likable with their own flaws.\\n\\n\r\nFutaba is the swwt naive one who has a HUGE interest in boobs and is oblivious to how taboo it really it. Shes physically strong and breaks alot of things\\n\\n\r\nMitsuba is a sadistic fuck who eats alot and puts on weight. But when it counts she comes through and shows that she has emotions. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then theres Hitoba my literal favourite. I adore her relationship with the teacher Yabechi sensei, as their moments are my favourite in the show. I regret to say that there arent too many of them, but when there are, its down right the funniest thing. Hitoba at 1st glance looks like the quiet shy book worm, but her books to peoples surprise are ecchi magazines and she has this super creepy face when shes pissed so people dont get close to her\\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters are pretty standard, the occult freak, the sass mcqueen, the hopeless romantic. Seeing them interact in different circumstances is what the highlight of this show it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI usually dont put series into my top favorites as im very critical about them, and my favourite shows usually just stems from the ones i watched long ago, so its difficult to find anything close. But Mitsudomoe now has a special place in my hear. Not one episode went by where i lmao'd on the fucking floor, it legitimate hurt. Now im not saying everyone should laugh, but I really doubt there wont be moments where you at least chuckle\\n\\n\r\nComedy 10/10\\n\r\nNow obviously the best part of this series is the comedy. Yabechi's hopeless single life as a virgin, Kotoba's obsession with boobs, the occult freak, the mauriu's dad who gets arrested every time bc he looks shady af, the dumbass nurse, the fact that everyone almost bleeds to dead whenever they get injured. Its all part of the package. The jokes arent predictable, they slowly take you through it and surprise you with a twist. Most of the comedy here although comes form misunderstandings, some repetitive but some just downright unique and hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nMitsudomoe is the stupidest most random best thing ive ever discovered this year, and Im so glad I did. I finished 2 seasons in one day and Now i dont know what to do with my life. I desperately tried to find shows which are similar but had no luck. I hope in the future we get comedy golds as this show and it bring as much happiness to others as it did for me\\n\\n\r\nIf you love your comedy anime, and even if you dont, I desperatly urge you to watch this series. It pains me to see that its not as high up as shows like Nichijou (Although personally i like mitsudomoe better oops)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Don't let the kiddy-looking kids fool you. This anime is about the adventures of the Marui triplets in sixth grade and their newly hired teacher who often gets pushed around by these girls into trouble which leaves the audience laughing till their stomach hurts. The oldest one, Mitsuba, is sadistic and kind of mature for her age. The middle one, Futaba, is perverted and very athletic and has the strength of a full-grown man. The youngest one, Hitoha, is generally very quiet and gentle but when push comes to shove, she might just be the strongest, the most perverted and the most sadistic out ofthe three. Though rated for middle ages, the anime encloses adult jokes and requires certain mind set to enjoy. Each episode is divided into different joke scenarios roughly connected within that episode.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems that MCs of Mitsudomoe has slight resemblence with that of K-ON! in terms of appearance and behaviour.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6.2/10 Not much of a story, but family relations got my attention. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10 Not much texture or character design. The kids look like they are in class 3. But the funny effects, stunned pos,camera angles, blood, drool, etc all adds to the comedic punch.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7/10 The anime has well made audio FX which uplifts and adds power to the awesome voice acting. This makes the humorous scenes heavily enjoyable. The opening being kiddish and very catchy is apt for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMC: 9/10 I loved the triplets for they make the show really enjoyable. The voice acting suits the character animations. They are well defined and unique.\\n\\n\r\nWorth watching?: Depends on what category of jokes you can enjoy. Watching a single episode can help make that decision.",

This is a review for both seasons of mitsudomoe.\r\nMitsudomoe is something most people aren't proud of liking. although i can't help but Love this show and give it a 10. It Knows what it is and it does It's job right, it's hilarious, Doesn't Attempt to have a plot, and it doesn't have anything too crude or too Sexual, it has everything. the person who made this show does not give a shit what people think of it. and it's Great because it's this way\r\nStory:6/10, there isno story,the three triplets and the Teacher's daily lives with some Side characters here and there.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10, the art is very subjective, you either love it or hate it, in my case i loved it, it's cute, not too detailed and not too bad either, there are sometimes were the art fucks up but most of the time it's well done and it makes it more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10, another subjective thing, i really liked the Openings and endings were alright, The background music was Great and the voice acting was the best part of it, especially Hitoha and Futaba's Voice actors, i really loved the sound in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10, Mitsudomoe has a bunch of very unique and hilarious characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe main three Sisters are each unique and funny in a way.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuba, who is sadistic and is Slightly overweight, Wishes to be called \"mitsuba-sama' and wants people to respect her, Fails most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle sister, Futaba, is an airhead but is also incredibly Strong to the point of being able to destroy tables with her hands, she also has an unhealthy obesssion with boobs.\\n\\n\r\nThe youngest, Hitoha, is my favorite. She's Very similar to Tomoko from Watamote, She's quiet,Gloomy, and people are scared from her but she's actually cute when people talk to her more. she also has a pet Hamster called Chikubi ( Nipples ) and she also likes Gachi rangers ( power rangers ripoff ).\\n\\n\r\nWith other characters like the triplets 'sketchy' dad,the Clumsy nurse, The Fresh new teacher, the pantsu loving student and a masochistic mother, the series has lots of unique and fun characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall rating:10/10, This show is Crude, it has tons of sexual themes and it has lots of crude,sexual humor. it's like a not-so-innocent version of Nichijou, there is no logic in this anime, there is just Lots and lots of hilarious moments, misunderstandings and stuff you don't want to be caught watching. the series doesn't have fanservice in it's Ecchi, as most of the Students are just middle schoolers but if you're into that then..suit yourself.",

It's the combination of the teacher, nurse and students which makes the plot so good.\r\nI don't think I've ever seen a series with more misunderstandings and it's hilarious.\r\nThe art is really fitting.

This show is a perfect storm of comedy and cuteness, and when I say cuteness, I don't mean moe.\r\nStory ~9/10~\r\nWell, there really isn't a story to this anime, at the end of the second season they tried to put in a story-ender (and they did successfully), but there was really no story to end. The show doesn't carry and underlying plot, it's more of a random slice of life about three triplets who are going through many new experiences from maturity to immature actions. Ididn't know sixth grade was so hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nArt ~8/10~\\n\r\nThe art isn't genre defining, but I like how the artists put in many different colors throughout each episode and because they did that, the situations often felt unique and worth continuing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound ~10/10~\\n\r\nThis is where I was most impressed. When watching this, I could easily see how much effort the voice actors/actresses had put into this show. The music was great, the dialogue was great, but I didn't get the feeling that the Japanese used by these sixth graders were easy to understand, as if a lot of the show was more adult oriented.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~8/10~\\n\r\nThe characters are not unique, but how these three triplets interact with each other does seem unique to me. One is a loud mouth who yells and commands respect, but her fatal flaw is here bad luck and weight concerns. The other is a dumb, blunt-athletic girl who often says things out of context very loudly and who's fatal flaw is a boob obsession. And finally the third and youngest triplet who is smart, but not social and her fatal flaw is a porn obsession, she'll sit there reading her porn magazines (with a fake book cover) all day during class.\\n\\n\r\nThose are some twisted kids.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, i fully enjoyed this anime. There was only a few moments were I wasn't rolling on the floor, but otherwise, the show was nearly perfect when it came to the comedy aspect.",

            "content": "Seeing as how hilarious this show is, I'm really surprised there are no reviews for it yet. Usually there are 10 reviews for any given show that's only a couple of episodes in. Same goes for the relatively low score. My guess is it's because of the art style that many people seem to be turned off by. Don't be mislead however, as this is by far the funniest thing to happen to anime this season.\r\nStory - It's really difficult to describe a show based on only a few episodes, but Mitsudomoe doesn't really need a full season's worth of episodes for that. The animeis gag driven, much like Azumanga Daioh. Each episode works as a standalone one, divided into multiple mini gag-based plots. That's not to say that there is no long term plot throughout the series, because there is. The story revolves around a male teacher, who begins his new career teaching a middle school class that contains the troublesome Marui triplets. There is also a clumsy school nurse that he falls in love with at the beginning. This love progresses, if you could even call it progress, as the episodes go on. Primarily though, the show is about the triplets and their teacher getting into all manner of hilarious circumstances, often involving the classmates and the school nurse. Beware however, since Mitsudomoe is adult humor driven much of the time.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - The first thing you might notice is that the art is reminiscent of Azumanga, particularly the heads. Unlike most of the anime released, it does not rely on the more realistic design approach, instead opting for the super cute. This suits Mitsudomoe perfectly in my opinion, since it amplifies the hilarity of many of the circumstances. In episode 3 you're introduced to the triplets' father, who is drawn in a rough/sketchy style. I find it makes for a funny contrast between him and everyone else. The animation is fluid and consistent in terms of quality, with often exaggerated expressions for added comedic effect. This works seamlessly in my opinion. \\n\r\nAs for the bg art, there isn't really much to say other than that it's drawn to compliment the simple character designs. The bg coloring is appealing with a muted palette, which sometimes exhibits a slightly marker rendered look.\\n\\n\r\nSound - This is where many shows fall flat in, typically not having anything praise worthy. The seiyuu's are noteworthy, especially Tomatsu Haruka (known for voicing Lala Deviluke from To LOVE-Ru) and Shimono Hiro (known for voicing Akihisa Yoshii from Baka To Test). The voice work is well done and brings out the characters' personalities really well. The sfx and atmospheric music also deserve to be praised, since they play an important role in the comedy. There are some truly hilarious sfx here and music that cues in at just the right time. The blood draining sound is especially amusing.\\n\r\nThe OP also deserves mentioning for its cute and catchy tune.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - We have the 3 Marui sisters, Yabe-sensei (main teacher), Kuriyama-sensei (school nurse), as well as many side characters that are introduced in more detail through various points in the story. The triplets consist of Futaba who is the perverted muscle girl, Hitoha who is the dark and gloomy one, and Mitsuba who is the sadistic type as well as the self proclaimed king of the class. The inexperienced, newly transferred teacher and super clumsy school nurse round out the main characters. There is also the father of the Marui sisters, who looks like a big, creepy pervert. I'd also mention all the other secondary characters, but I'd need a lot more space to describe them all. Needless to say, they all have their own unique personalities that get their spotlight as the anime progresses. Overall, a great and entertaining assortment of characters make up Mitsudomoe.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I'm loving this! Simple as that. Sometimes gag based shows are needed to change the pace and this manages to do just that for me. The relationship between the triplets and everyone around them is entertaining and I can't help but cheer up after watching each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - If you loved Azumanga Daioh, then you will probably like this. Keep in mind that even though Mitsudomoe has a very innocent air about it, it is meant for a more mature audience largely because of the adult humor. If you can appreciate humor the way I do, but at the same time are not easily turned off by the cute art style or the adult themes, then give Mitsudomoe a serious consideration. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "Mitsudomoe is the stupidest anime I have ever had the good fortune to see. The premise is clich\u00e9; the everyday life of three very unique sisters. The art is awful and follows a long line of under-budget slice-of-life comedies that always end up in your computer's recycling bin after viewing. But by some miracle, Mistudomoe is fresh and funny, and will always leave you craving for another episode. What Mistudomoe also is though, is vulgar. It's rude and frequently disgusting, idiotic and atrocious, and violent and inappropriate in any way it can be. That being said you should easily be able to tell it's oneof the funniest things on TV.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nYabe-sensei is class 6-3's new teacher. His class appears normal and easy-going at first, but then to his dismay, he has to control all three of the craaaaziest kids in school who just HAPPEN to be triplet sisters. The Marui triplets run amok through the school and cause everyone problems everywhere. Now, that's about it for the actual story, but whatever segment you watch in Mistudomoe always ends up being laugh out loud funny by the end. The jokes rely a lot on misunderstandings, running gags, and dirty humor. For example, the Marui's father is drawn with a thick black line around him, and the line makes him look extra suspicious. How is this supposed to be funny? Anytime their father tries to do something for them he always ends up getting arrested by the cops. Eventually the joke becomes so frequent you have dialogue like \"Sorry girls, I was late because I was arrested three times on the way here.\" If you've a certain disdain for bathroom humor, I would not recommend this. There were actually a few scenes that made me so sick I almost gagged myself (a shining example is the episode in which the nurse accidentally spills everyone in the schools urine samples on the ground).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nOh, well, it's bad. If you're watching Mistudomoe then the visuals aren't your top priority. It looks very basic and some would as far to say it looks generic - but oh the reaction faces. Even if what just happened in the anime wasn't funny, if Futaba (the middle sister) does her euphoric \"my brain is dead\" face I'd laugh. The emotion that comes out of the characters faces definitely increases the quality of the humor and characters. The art style works for what kind of anime this is, but I think many things could have been improved upon, and if Mistudomoe were re-done the thing that I would ask be worked would be the backgrounds, CG, and overall fluidity of animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great! The very main cast was voiced by some pretty obscure folks, the most well known one, who voiced Nagi in Kannagi, is Tomatsu Haruka, who voices Hitoha (the youngest sister) in Mistudomoe. The side cast is blooming with stars, including Aki Toyosaki (Yui from K-ON!), Inoue Kikuko (Lust from FMA:B), Saito Chiwa (Aika from Aria), and last but not least, Chihara Minori who voices Yuki in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the musical portion. The opening instantly caught me off guard, all three girls of the main cast could sing so well! The singing and dancing set you up for an exciting episode every time - not once did I skip the opening song. The ending song was rather unfitting though. It's a slow almost melancholic song that doesn't really seem right until the very last episode. Then there's the BGM. Always supplying a chuckle the music ranges from parodies of talk shows to classical music pieces played in incredibly unfitting ways. Since this show uses a lot of slapstick, the sound effects are also an important part. I found the noises that came from whatever always top notch (the blood leaking noises were so silly I got hearty laugh the first time it happened).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe \"three stooges\" concept has been in media for quite a long time and has become so frequent that it's become clich\u00e9. I started watching Mistudomoe expecting some ridiculous corny character archetypes, and I kinda got exactly that. No there's not a lot of character development, no changes over time, no sudden changes in character, and so on. What Mitsudomoe has that other shows lack is the application of such poor designs into being jokes themselves. I've already explained the storyline - and if you take it for face value - it's horrendous. Now if you were to take the storyline and combine it with a colorful cast of different personalities bumping back and forth into each other, you'd have something much more interesting. Each side character has his or her little own story, and after the point that they have been introduced they fall back into being side characters - but the thing is that now they keep adding to the story. Whereas the usual slice of life would have episodic episodes of characters and then you'd never see them again, Mistudomoe repeatedly brings back the same characters again and again making a refreshing feel every time they come back.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast includes the sadistic eldest sister, Mistuba, the perverted middle sister Futaba, and the introverted youngest sister Hitoha. Their teacher is an unlucky geek, their dad is loving fellow easily mistaken as a pedophile, and their friends are plentiful. There's the pervert, the nice kid mistaken as a pervert, his three female stalkers, the rival girl and her clique, the romantic, the occult freak, the hamster named nipples and the monkey faced kid. The best part about this anime is seeing how each character interacts with another, and every time they do, something ridiculous happens.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI laughed so hard I got sick and had to go to bed for over 14 hours to recover. Or well, maybe I was sick and the laughing triggered my allergies and then I kept coughing until I had to lie down and go to sleep.\\n\\n\r\nWant an interesting approach to something that has already been done, and want it from a viewpoint where it hacks the slice of life genre to pieces? Mitsudomoe should hit right home. The thing is though, if you didn't listen to warning at the beginning of this review about vulgarity and stupid humor then you're going to hate this. Hate it a lot. This is not an anime to be viewed for it's cutesy moments so abundant in slice of life (although it does has some), it's meant to be a hilarious attempt to get revenge upon the predictable slice of life genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIn short, Mitsudomoe is both great and awful. Plot wise, it's no better than the worst of anime, but the common misconception is that Mitsudomoe is an anime that is dependent on it's jokes for goodness, not it's riveting storyline (for it has none). The way the characters collide with such wit kept my full attention, while the chance of seeing it again kept me watching. The slapstick might not be for everyone though, it's sure to turn off a fair amount of people and I think that's a shame, because I really enjoyed this anime. So if you're interested in a good laugh, just throw on any episode of Mitsudomoe and have at it.",

            "content": "\"Did you think all kids are pure? Think again\" - Me\r\nThose phrases are the best word to describe this anime,anyway  Mitsudomoe is your funny and eccentric anime that you wouldn't find in anywhere. If there was anime that something like this, it would be Azumanga Daioh. This anime suprisingly is EXTREMELY funny, i am not exaggerate it, but it really does. beside of the awful art and average sounding, This anime gives some fresh jokes, not like the other comedy-gag anime which is usually really pushes the jokes, repetitive and even nothing funny at all. Thanks to the god, this anime wasn't like that.\r\nMitsudomoeis not all-age-gag-anime, i am must saying this again NOT-ALL-AGE-GAG-ANIME. since there is so much mature material that involves in this anime. Dont judge the anime just because of the covers. and it applies for this anime, It maybe like an anime for kids since this anime was all about kids and their activity in school. If you had thinking like that, then you have made a mistake. If Azumanga Daioh or Nichijou focus on how cute, pure and clumsy child is, then it Mitsudomoe is the \"EVIL version\" of them. Mitsudomoe jokes are literally a kind of adult jokes like Seitokai Yakuindomo, If Seitokai Yakuindomo usually use \"vulgar\" jokes then Mitsudomoe more less than that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in  Mitsudomoe is about The 11-year-old Marui triplets, yeah TRIPLETS. that being known as the most problematic kids in the school, and unluckily, Satoshi Yabe, the newly graduated teacher must led the class that have the trouble maker triplets.\\n\\n\r\nSince this anime is a gag anime, so, it doesnt have any main story or main goal. Usually their story in each episode are standalone, and from each episode, it usually consists of  mini gag-story like Danshi koukoushei no Nichijou. and its really usual for a gag anime that they use this method in their anime so its not surprising, If we're talking a gag anime, of course the story is not their main priority, the main focus of a gag anime is jokes. No matter how good their art, sound, or story is, if the jokes wasnt funny then its not a gag anime. So, the main question is, Is Mitsudomoe amusing to watch? For me, Yes it is.\\n\\n\r\nLike what i said before, Art is not the main priority in a gag. So does in Mitsudomoe. The weakest section of this anime are in art, but, for me is not something that we would critize at. Furthermore, there is something special in Mitsudomoe's art. Like how different between the triplet father with other character (The triplet father is being drawn differently with the other character). and do not miss the comedic effect too (like the funny expression that the character does or overly reaction to something). Something like comedic effect is usually intend to make the anime more funnier and sometimes to cover the lack in art section (See how Seto no Hanayome works) and with that method, its really work in Mitsudomoe.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, there isnt something that really prominent, but how the each character respond the jokes are really amazing. The timing between their jokes and how they respond is really hit the spot.Especially Yabe Satoshi. Well, if you hear carefully you will realize that the seiyuu (Hiro Shimono) is an expert about this one (respond on the jokes) are the seiyuu for Akihisa from baka to test which we known are always use \"respond\" jokes and exaggerate respond. and for the OP and the ED, i didnt really notice it, since its just some catchy-child tones that i dont really like it. But how this story was about, its really fits with the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to Character section, the main character in Mitsudomoe is the triplets marui and the new graduated teacher, Yabe Satoshi. for the triplets, there is Marui Mitsuba, Marui Futaba, and Marui Hitoha.\\n\\n\r\nMarui Mitsuba is the eldest sister between three of them, she is someone who likes to torturing people or we can call the sadistic one. But for the eldest, she is somehow care for her younger sisters even she is didnt show it openly. She has obsession with being a king and more she proclaimed that she is a mature even though no people are really care about it.\\n\\n\r\nMarui Futaba is the second daughter in Marui triplets, she has a weird obsession and it was Boobs (yeah, a 11 YEARS old that has obsession with boobs), even she was like that, she is so athletic errr... not athletic maybe the words that fits with her is \"superhero power\". She is able to destroy wall, table, or doors without any sweats and even she can run more faster than a scooter. Even she is strong like a superhero, she is kinda clumsy.\\n\\n\r\nMarui Hitoha, the youngest sister in Marui Triplets, my favorite character. She is a taciturn girl which always carries a \"glory\" books. What i mean in glory book is PORN magazine. beside of her emotionless, introvert and taciturn. She is a being feared by the other sisters and even the other sisters not dare to make her angry.\\n\\n\r\nYabe Satoshi, is the homeroom teacher for the triplets. He always being a victim of the triplets. Not too much known for this character, since he was too normal for main character, maybe like Shinpachi from gintama.\\n\\n\r\nSummary, every character in Mitsudomoe have their own unique personalities, from the one that really perverted, the one that has obsession with supernatural things, even into a several girls who claimed as the Hopeless squad. With each their uniqueness, it brings Mitsudomoe into a bunch of people with their unique personalities, and for me, its really amusing to watch all of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last, Mitsudomoe is something unique and keeps the viewer to watch it, with all the randomness that happen and all the unique personalities that all of the character have, you mustn't miss this funny anime. This anime always makes me laughing from the first episode to the last episode. I really recommend this.\\n\\n\r\nCritize, comments, or any feedbacks are welcome. :)\\n\\n",

Today, we shall be reviewing the series: Mitsudomoe!\r\nStory: While the whole loli's harrassing teacher plot is alittle over used, I still love this type of plot, so I give it a 10. \r\nArt: I really love the art style alot. It's so cute yet detailed.\r\nSound: I really like the opening song. The ending one is pretty good too, but not really my cup of tea. The voice actors sound epic, too.\r\nCharacters: There's Mitsuba, my favorite, who is the oldest, and kinda mean to all the other characters, but still somewhat shy and lovable. Futaba, the natural airhead who'samazingly strong and almost always happy. And Hitoha, the somewhat demonic emotionless loli. Then there are side characters and teachers that I won't bother with.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment and overall: This was a cute and funny series, but not reccomended for people who like more \"All ages\" type of jokes. If you don't mind somewhat gross and perverted humor, then you may like this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Story:\r\nIt is about three elementary school triplets that have three very different personalities and a teacher who teaches all of them. However sadly the teacher barely had any role in this show which would probably have made it much funnier. Near the end the jokes get tiring as they are repetitive.\r\nArt:\r\nAnimation is sufficient. The girls are cute enough, the exaggerations for comedic effect were well executed, however predictable and repetitive.  If you are into the cute elementary school animation then you will appreciate it, however if you are one of those that absolutely despise the cutesy animation then this is not for you towatch.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBackground music is bearable. They could have really used less silences, because at some points of the show, it just got boring without any background music. (This is hard to notice though unless you pay attention it) The opening song though is very good, and I love the chorus with the dance. Cheers me right up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe highlight of the show is the very defined characters, each with their own stereotypical personalities. Once again, it did get repetitive, but there were a diverse amount of characters to show sufficient originality in terms of the comedy of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really am a sucker for comedies such as these. However the problem with this is that the comedy was not very original, and almost every joke was a dirty joke, so you could practically predict every punchline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis is not something that you must watch, but more of something you watch if you are extremely bored. It is not a show to marathon, but to spread out over a long time period so you might forget a joke that they are planning to use again. You might look at this review and think that a 6 is really low, however given that a 5 is average, this show is indeed above average.",

JUST KIDDING.  i'm not the type to grade to harsh or exact. i'm the type to forgive a little (especially the skypier arc in one  piece that shit was long) since i really like it. and now THAT IS ALL",

I wanted to be self-righteous ...\r\nBut I can't do it.  I can't because ... this is one of the funniest animes I have seen in a long, long while!\r\nYou'll feel guilty laughing and you'll constantly look over your shoulder to make sure no one sees you but you wont be able to help it!\r\nThis is a series that is probably best described as the messy end result after a car crash involving Minami-ke, Nichijou andKyou no Go no Ni.  It combines three sisters with hugely different personalities with zany comedy and light perversion in a elementary school setting.\\n\\n\r\nTo say there is no plot would be an understatement but you wouldn't be looking for one if you were considering watching this in the first place.  What makes this series so humorous are the characters which are extreme to say the least!  The interactions of the three sisters with one another and the sensei will have you laughing out loud in every episode guaranteed.  It is further enriched with the varied support cast, all of whom contribute to the ridiculous comedy.  The situations are crude, bordering on criminal but just prevents it self from going too far.  I wont say too much for risk of spoiling it but watch a random episode and you will see what I mean. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is further enhanced with the catchy opening theme, a rather surprising melodic ending theme and with the stellar seiyu cast including Haruka Tomatsu,  Hiro Shimono, Chiwa Saito and a cameo from the ever eternal Kikuko Inoue. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a great series to watch if you want a break from the more serious series out there.  I've watched it in between Bokurano and Monster, which has allowed me to slow my heart down a little!\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended!",

I have been watching anime for 25 or so years and this is one of the funniest ones yet.  \r\nThe Marui triplets are either dangerous or insane.  I feel sorry for their homeroom teacher that has to watch after them.  It is gag-based and it works.  Some animes just can't pull this off.\r\nThe animation I thought is pretty good.  Note: I have seen some really bad animes in the past.  But that is the evolution of anime.\r\nI am only on episode 4 soit could get worse.  We shall see in the next few months.\\n\r\nWatch and enjoy.  Make sure you are eating or drinking anything while watching the exploits of the Marui triplets, you may just have to clean up a big mess.\\n\\n\\n\r\nfollow me on twitter: anime_guru\\n\\n",

            "content": "As a fan of comedy and slice of life anime, I am pretty surprised at how well-received this anime is. I just didn't find it very funny - for the most part it just grossed me out.\r\nThe story? Well this isn't a story-based anime. It's a slice of life comedy, so calling it out on its lack of story would be foolish. The idea is that a nervous new teacher has a class of bratty children to deal with, including three sisters who are sure to give him a hard time. \"Hilarity\" ensues.\r\nThe art and sound are both sub-par. Which is unsurprising from the forgettablestudio Bridge. I dislike the character designs a lot. They are very unappealing in that they aren't at all cute. They are sort of comedic with some occasionally funny expressions, but not exceedingly. I'm no expert on OST but this left on impression on me whatsoever. The OP is... alright at capturing the tone of the show. So yeah, it's pretty grating and not very listenable. I have no issues with the voice acting - there are a few big name seiyuu's but none of the voices I heard left much of an impression.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters, I am not a fan either. Some of them have okay personalities, or at least personalities that clearly fit what archetype they should be. But the character comedy was weak. The tropes were set in stone and just sort of acted accordingly. This can be done well but the characters themselves were just not likeable for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe teacher is forgettable and just sort of has no spine. He lacks personality. The sisters - I actually find all of them annoying. One is a real himedere, and likes seeing others suffer - but she's often downtrodden herself. Then there is the airheaded one who is also very strong. She is also mostly a nice person, but then is inconsiderate sometimes too? She had the most potential to be likeable, but between doing some physically gross things and just not being helpful I couldn't warm to her. The youngest sister is the worst. She's got a very dark aura, but not in a brilliant relate-able way like Tomoko Kuroki from Watamote for example. She's just sort of... terrible. A very unpleasant character. Other supporting characters are mostly forgettable and not likeable. The boys are pretty much just perverts which is... ugh. And there is the new school nurse who is just a ditz. In a very over-the-top and annoying way. She's absolutely useless, and it goes too far to be funny. I just wound up disliking her. She's also part of the most disgusting scene ever - let's just say it involves urine.\\n\\n\r\nNow I know it seems that I have been overly-critical of these 11-year old characters. After all, they are kids. Kids are supposed to be bratty. Well... Sure. But maybe in a less vulgar way? And maybe they shouldn't all be so consistently irritating? I'm not saying they necessarily had to be cute, but they REALLY weren't cute. At all. They are about as un-cute as it gets. And yet, there are all of these swimming pool scenes, various scenes about getting a bra and boys being interested - I don't really like this aspect of it either. It felt weird to me. I know they aren't babies so it's not exactly unreasonable, but I just couldn't get enjoyment over that stuff that happens in the class at all. Again, a lot of this would be forgivable or maybe even a good thing if it was actually funny. But for me, it just wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nI may have touched on this, but my personal enjoyment was the problem here. It got barely a couple of chuckles out of me. I think I cringed more while watching it. The jokes were pretty predictable and never really caught me by surprise - except for when it got more unpleasant than I expected it to.\\n\\n\r\nPlease by all means take this review with a pinch of salt from the fact that I've seen so little of the show. But with these kinds of anime with no real plot, that is less of an issue that clouds judgement. I think this anime has too many overly-positive reviews, so just please be warned that this anime might not be as hilarious to you as some are painting it to be.",

This anime was so great i don't really know how to express it, well it made me a fanboy that's for sure, this is exactly what i want from Comedy anime, i laugh so much i had to pause to breath XD\r\nArt- 9/10\r\nThe Art is great, it does not rely on the more realistic design approach, instead opting for the super cute, funny and scary, Hitoha scary scenes are so well done, then you have Futaba destruction scenes and rampage style witch was done so well.\r\nCharacters- 9/10\r\nThe Triplet Sisters are just AWESOME!!!! The youngest is dark and scary, socially awkward but cute and softon the inside, The middle sister is a pervert for boobs, so athletic that she can break walls but easy embarrassed, The eldest sister is sadistic, glutton but worried about her weight, and craves for attention. These combination makes for great and funny scenes that will make you laugh more than you possibly can.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall i had never laugh so much watching anything from movies to tv series, Mitsudomoe is Comedy non-stop, funny stuff one after another, i might be over-rating who knows and who cares it's comedy or you like it or you don't. So i totally recommend this to everyone.\\n\\n",

I rated the \"story\" a five because, let's face it there is no story. Just the three Marui triplets enjoying their everyday life :) And their everyday life just so happens to be the funniest life ever!\r\n     Any ways, I HIGHLY recommend this anime. It's not for children obviously. But it's still awesome! Granted they are young, and a lot of ignorant people call it a \"lolicon\" anime even though theyhaven't watched the show. JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE CHILDREN DOESN'T MAKE IT LOLICON! I mean seriously (-_-) people judge too quickly. Yes, they do draw them kind of erotically sometimes, but the overall script between characters is HILARIOUS. \\n\\n\r\n     Now, let's see....oh yes, the \"art\". The \"art\" was really good. they made all the characters kawaii looking. It might only be me but I love the chibi style animes, they're just so cute! (^.^) Next is sound. Yes I loved the sound. All of it. The music, background noises and panning when necessary. I especially love the \u30b9\u30a4\u30fc  (Suiii) whenever Hitoha walks by and people stare at her! NEXT is characters. All the characters were amazing, all unique in their own way and all of them easy to remember. \\n\\n\r\n     Now my conclusion...Well I enjoyed this anime so much I rated it 10, but if the numbers went higher, I would go even higher than that! It was just such a funny show. Laughed so hard almost all the time!\\n\\n\r\nMy overall rating is of course 10 \"Outstanding!\"\\n\\n\r\nI hope you all enjoyed my review! :)",

It's your slice of life Anime; it follows the lives of 'ordinary' people while throwing real life situations (well, exaggerated ones at least..) at you. I can honestly say that I was kept laughing well through EACH and every episode.\r\nStory? There's not much of a story. Though they do connect with each other slightly, each episode can be watched out of order, and it wouldn't take too long to catch on with what's going on. Seeing as it's a slice of life though,I wouldn't take any regards to a story rating.\\n\\n\r\nThe art worked well for it's genre. The little round faces just made everything all the funnier, while the girls never failed to put on an expression that would send me literally 'LOL'ing at my computer screen. \\n\\n\r\nSounds? Well, it's catchy. I love the voice actors, if it counts for any. The OP songs are incredibly cute and catchy -- you wouldn't expect to watch what you're going to watch from watching the OP. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are your stereotypical 'Tsundere', 'Airhead', and 'Silent' type girls. ...While the males are strung about perverse characteristics (+the one popular boy). \\n\\n\r\nAll this being said, Mitsudomoe is definitely high up on the enjoyment level. Whenever I'm in need for a laugh, Mitsudomoe is there for me. :')",

            "content": "THIS FUCKING SHOW OMG\r\nLet me start by telling you, Iv'e seen my fair share of comedy anime from the satirical take of fantasy genre's like Konosuba, to the Slap stick comedies that is daily life of highschool boys. After watching watching TDLHB i thought there isnt anything funnier than this, im sure, But then i came across mitsudomoe.\r\nokay so right of the bat people looking at the synopsis are gonna think its some moe blob shit with a light hearted tale about these 3 triplets and their teacher. Well its not\r\nThis anime is like the southpark of american television. It has no shame in talkingabout panties, and bra's and straight forward sex jokes in the open without making it weird for the viewers. So if u like that sorta shit, this is for you\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nIts slice of life and comedy, although more comedy than slice of life, but what are you gonna expect. The plot itself is pretty basic, 3 crazy ass triplets in a class full of crazy ass people with a teacher. standard stuff\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nI really dont get why people hate on the art so much, its usually because of the type of art style, I think this type of art style perfectly suited the show. The animation was just as it should be to fit the basic comedy elements in it, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Those facial expressions tho\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nI did particularly like the ost for this series even though they were basic comedic ones. AND THAT 2ND OPENING OMG, its legit in my top ops ever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nAnd damn do i like these characters. Mitsudomoe is primarily on how the characters act with one another in different situations. They've all build unique relationships with each other so it makes it seem like you know them personally sometimes.\\n\r\nSo 1stly we have the triplets, Futoba, Hitoba and Mitsuba, all pretty likable with their own flaws.\\n\\n\r\nFutaba is the swwt naive one who has a HUGE interest in boobs and is oblivious to how taboo it really it. Shes physically strong and breaks alot of things\\n\\n\r\nMitsuba is a sadistic fuck who eats alot and puts on weight. But when it counts she comes through and shows that she has emotions. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then theres Hitoba my literal favourite. I adore her relationship with the teacher Yabechi sensei, as their moments are my favourite in the show. I regret to say that there arent too many of them, but when there are, its down right the funniest thing. Hitoba at 1st glance looks like the quiet shy book worm, but her books to peoples surprise are ecchi magazines and she has this super creepy face when shes pissed so people dont get close to her\\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters are pretty standard, the occult freak, the sass mcqueen, the hopeless romantic. Seeing them interact in different circumstances is what the highlight of this show it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI usually dont put series into my top favorites as im very critical about them, and my favourite shows usually just stems from the ones i watched long ago, so its difficult to find anything close. But Mitsudomoe now has a special place in my hear. Not one episode went by where i lmao'd on the fucking floor, it legitimate hurt. Now im not saying everyone should laugh, but I really doubt there wont be moments where you at least chuckle\\n\\n\r\nComedy 10/10\\n\r\nNow obviously the best part of this series is the comedy. Yabechi's hopeless single life as a virgin, Kotoba's obsession with boobs, the occult freak, the mauriu's dad who gets arrested every time bc he looks shady af, the dumbass nurse, the fact that everyone almost bleeds to dead whenever they get injured. Its all part of the package. The jokes arent predictable, they slowly take you through it and surprise you with a twist. Most of the comedy here although comes form misunderstandings, some repetitive but some just downright unique and hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nMitsudomoe is the stupidest most random best thing ive ever discovered this year, and Im so glad I did. I finished 2 seasons in one day and Now i dont know what to do with my life. I desperately tried to find shows which are similar but had no luck. I hope in the future we get comedy golds as this show and it bring as much happiness to others as it did for me\\n\\n\r\nIf you love your comedy anime, and even if you dont, I desperatly urge you to watch this series. It pains me to see that its not as high up as shows like Nichijou (Although personally i like mitsudomoe better oops)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Don't let the kiddy-looking kids fool you. This anime is about the adventures of the Marui triplets in sixth grade and their newly hired teacher who often gets pushed around by these girls into trouble which leaves the audience laughing till their stomach hurts. The oldest one, Mitsuba, is sadistic and kind of mature for her age. The middle one, Futaba, is perverted and very athletic and has the strength of a full-grown man. The youngest one, Hitoha, is generally very quiet and gentle but when push comes to shove, she might just be the strongest, the most perverted and the most sadistic out ofthe three. Though rated for middle ages, the anime encloses adult jokes and requires certain mind set to enjoy. Each episode is divided into different joke scenarios roughly connected within that episode.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems that MCs of Mitsudomoe has slight resemblence with that of K-ON! in terms of appearance and behaviour.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6.2/10 Not much of a story, but family relations got my attention. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10 Not much texture or character design. The kids look like they are in class 3. But the funny effects, stunned pos,camera angles, blood, drool, etc all adds to the comedic punch.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7/10 The anime has well made audio FX which uplifts and adds power to the awesome voice acting. This makes the humorous scenes heavily enjoyable. The opening being kiddish and very catchy is apt for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMC: 9/10 I loved the triplets for they make the show really enjoyable. The voice acting suits the character animations. They are well defined and unique.\\n\\n\r\nWorth watching?: Depends on what category of jokes you can enjoy. Watching a single episode can help make that decision.",

This is a review for both seasons of mitsudomoe.\r\nMitsudomoe is something most people aren't proud of liking. although i can't help but Love this show and give it a 10. It Knows what it is and it does It's job right, it's hilarious, Doesn't Attempt to have a plot, and it doesn't have anything too crude or too Sexual, it has everything. the person who made this show does not give a shit what people think of it. and it's Great because it's this way\r\nStory:6/10, there isno story,the three triplets and the Teacher's daily lives with some Side characters here and there.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10, the art is very subjective, you either love it or hate it, in my case i loved it, it's cute, not too detailed and not too bad either, there are sometimes were the art fucks up but most of the time it's well done and it makes it more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10, another subjective thing, i really liked the Openings and endings were alright, The background music was Great and the voice acting was the best part of it, especially Hitoha and Futaba's Voice actors, i really loved the sound in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10, Mitsudomoe has a bunch of very unique and hilarious characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe main three Sisters are each unique and funny in a way.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuba, who is sadistic and is Slightly overweight, Wishes to be called \"mitsuba-sama' and wants people to respect her, Fails most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle sister, Futaba, is an airhead but is also incredibly Strong to the point of being able to destroy tables with her hands, she also has an unhealthy obesssion with boobs.\\n\\n\r\nThe youngest, Hitoha, is my favorite. She's Very similar to Tomoko from Watamote, She's quiet,Gloomy, and people are scared from her but she's actually cute when people talk to her more. she also has a pet Hamster called Chikubi ( Nipples ) and she also likes Gachi rangers ( power rangers ripoff ).\\n\\n\r\nWith other characters like the triplets 'sketchy' dad,the Clumsy nurse, The Fresh new teacher, the pantsu loving student and a masochistic mother, the series has lots of unique and fun characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall rating:10/10, This show is Crude, it has tons of sexual themes and it has lots of crude,sexual humor. it's like a not-so-innocent version of Nichijou, there is no logic in this anime, there is just Lots and lots of hilarious moments, misunderstandings and stuff you don't want to be caught watching. the series doesn't have fanservice in it's Ecchi, as most of the Students are just middle schoolers but if you're into that then..suit yourself.",

They all have funny personalities, one's more original than the other but definitely good enough to make you laugh.\r\nThe story's good but it still just a school anime. It's the combination of the teacher, nurse and students which makes the plot so good.\r\nI don't think I've ever seen a series with more misunderstandings and it's hilarious.\r\nThe art is really fitting. Especially some effects. The opening's done quite good as well.\r\nMitsudomoe is really enjoyable. It wouldn't be the first anime I'd recommend but I would eventually. Someof the running gags are just so good.",

            "content": "I watched this anime because on another website it said it was a romance... I quickly found it it wasn't. This show is a perfect storm of comedy and cuteness, and when I say cuteness, I don't mean moe.\r\nStory ~9/10~\r\nWell, there really isn't a story to this anime, at the end of the second season they tried to put in a story-ender (and they did successfully), but there was really no story to end. The show doesn't carry and underlying plot, it's more of a random slice of life about three triplets who are going through many new experiences from maturity to immature actions. Ididn't know sixth grade was so hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nArt ~8/10~\\n\r\nThe art isn't genre defining, but I like how the artists put in many different colors throughout each episode and because they did that, the situations often felt unique and worth continuing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound ~10/10~\\n\r\nThis is where I was most impressed. When watching this, I could easily see how much effort the voice actors/actresses had put into this show. The music was great, the dialogue was great, but I didn't get the feeling that the Japanese used by these sixth graders were easy to understand, as if a lot of the show was more adult oriented.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~8/10~\\n\r\nThe characters are not unique, but how these three triplets interact with each other does seem unique to me. One is a loud mouth who yells and commands respect, but her fatal flaw is here bad luck and weight concerns. The other is a dumb, blunt-athletic girl who often says things out of context very loudly and who's fatal flaw is a boob obsession. And finally the third and youngest triplet who is smart, but not social and her fatal flaw is a porn obsession, she'll sit there reading her porn magazines (with a fake book cover) all day during class.\\n\\n\r\nThose are some twisted kids.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, i fully enjoyed this anime. There was only a few moments were I wasn't rolling on the floor, but otherwise, the show was nearly perfect when it came to the comedy aspect.",

            "content": "This is most probably the first time I\u2019ve encounter a story about primary students because most of the series about students today are about high school. There are even middle school students. \r\nAs young as they may seem, surprisingly the storyline is very much for adults. There is so much ecchi-ness or censored materials in the storyline. It is so hilarious yet so surreal that the ecchi-ness comes from little children. Although, it is so surreal to see so much ecchi-ness from children, the comical acts and mature lines are still nicely done and could be considered tasteful. The comedy is well made and definitelynot far-fetched. I just love how simple misunderstandings make things complicated and hilarious. The misunderstandings are also brilliantly made. Every episode is just hilarious. There are definitely no dull moments in this series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think that because it is about primary students they are a bunch of innocent angels then YOU ARE HORRIBLY WRONG. I\u2019ve never seen characters with so much ecchi-ness like this and they are even children. That makes it a lot more interesting and for some reason more hilarious. I never thought mature jokes would blend well with very young characters. It becomes a lot more hilarious because the mature lines and comical acts are well delivered by the characters. Sometimes you would think that with their unique hilarious antics, there must be something wrong with them at their age. I love the character of the Yabe-chi who\u2019s usually the target of torture and weird antics of his students. Even the father is hilarious with his own way. Well, almost all the characters have their own role and own way of bringing laughter to the table. All of them are just so adorable and definitely likeable characters.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s not forget the most hilarious and ecchi of them all, the Marui sisters. Each three are very much different. The eldest is very tsundere like, the middle is so strong and air-headed, and the youngest is weird and scary. Though there are very different, all of them are very ecchi in their own unique way. And even if they are weird, they are still kind and nice children in their own weird way. They have their differences most of the time but they still genuinely love each other and care about the welfare of one another. Particularly the eldest, Mitsuba, whose very egoist but deep down cares a lot about her younger sisters. But my favorite is the very cute and most hilarious character, Futaba. She is just too much. A bundle of cuteness and weirdness. She\u2019s incredibly strong and extremely air-headed. Her personality just makes her a lot more adorable and hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not the typical like the ones of today\u2019s. It is quite different but in a good way. The unique and nicely done illustrations absolutely bring the most adorable characters I\u2019ve ever seen. Even the adult characters are very cute. I also love how the opening theme is made. It is cute and fun as well.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it so much I just can\u2019t stop watching and actually wanting for more episodes. There is absolutely no end for the cuteness and hilariousness for this bunch. I even wanted to just grab them from the monitor and cuddle them.\\n",
