            "content": "Witch Craft Works! An anime about witches and stuff. An average anime with clich\u00e9 characters and not much of a plot. Even though I say that, it was still an enjoyable watch. With outstanding animation and the great OST, WCW was a nice 12-ep anime which was pretty funny with it's catchy ending song.\r\nStory. 7\r\nThe story is about a normal boy, going to school as always, but then one day the schools most popular girl starts to interact with him. After getting to know her, he learns of her identity as a witch. She tells him about the special \"being\" inside of him and startsto protect him from danger. \\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple in the beginning, but after a while it gets a little better but it's not anything special. There are pretty cool fights sometimes but they don't really go in dept with the story, so don't expect anything extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nArt. 9.5\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is just outstanding as I mentioned before. Well, the characters might look a little weird but the background and all the details are one of the best I've ever seen in an anime. The action scenes are very beatifully drawn while also being epic!\\n\\n\r\nSound. 9\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really good, for real. I like the opening but the ending is just addictive, it's a very catchy song with a bit disturbing video, but it's cute! The voice acting can be a little annoying sometimes but it fits, it gives more of a comedical feeling to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 6.3\\n\\n\r\nWell, there some characters that were pretty cool but were not any of the main characters. Most of the characters are the archetypes and the main character is preeeettyy annoying, but if you're able to see trough that, you'll probably enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 7.8\\n\\n\r\nIt was an enjoyable anime for me and I do not regret watching it, it was very fun at times and the visuals and the BGM was very pleasant. However, it still has a lot of flaws and it isn't a masterpiece. If you are to watch this anime, don't have too high expectations, just think of it as a light hearted anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall. 7.8\\n\\n\r\nIt was definitely worth the watch, but I'm not too fond of these sub-harem animes. The ending was satisfactory but nothing special. The comedy part of this anime can be pretty fun and despite the main characters personality and the lack of plot, the other things makes up for it and it becomes a pleasant enough anime. \\n\\n\r\nSORRY FOR THE BAD ENGLISH. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "An anime where the villains are more entertaining to watch than the main cast, Witch Craft Works takes pages from Pokemon and does it better than Team Rocket.\r\nStory: 7\r\nIn a world with two warring witch guilds, the Workshop Witches and the more evil Tower Witches, our main hero is to be protected by a very strong Workshop Witch.  The typical story of a powerless protagonist to become a strong hero is overdone and things that happen throughout this story are standard to the plot of a rising hero.  There are parts where I was confused on contracts and such, but this comes morefrom my dislike of reading contracts and how a contract could contradict another contract or how establishing a contract can make one null and void.  Reasons why I never will be a lawyer.  \\n\\n\r\nThough I have said that the plot is of a typical rising hero, this common story help set a pacing that was perfect.  The rising hero storyline follows a rollercoaster of pacing, where it starts off slow and precedes to pick up as the main character learns new skills and eventually takes on the main antagonist.  One reason why this type of storyline is slow at the start is because of the pure focus on the main character, going from a weakling to a stronger hero, the pacing reflects that.  Witch Craft Works throws a wrench into that focus on the main hero as his teacher who is strong from the start helps with battles and fighting.  There are training scenes combined with scenes involving the teacher fighting that create a smooth pacing throughout the series.     \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was either super amazing or just super choppy.  Amazing parts include the animation of art and flying, the character designs as well as the designs for the minions and all the details put into the city.  Some choppy parts included a choppy 3D animation at the end, some fighting scenes, especially between minions, looked awkward as well as some explosions appeared to have missing frames.  The proportions for Kagari looks weird as well.. I mean anime with big-boobed characters look normal compared to Kagari... There is somethign about the way she is drawn that doesn't look quite right.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about the art was the use of color.  Monochrome art is something that isn't seen too often but Witch Craft Works uses it exceedingly well.  Certain scenes just blew me away with all the hues and shades used of a color.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OP, \"divine intervention\" was a decent OP that reflected the fantasy aspect of a mages world.  The way it did this was through playing \"happy\" notes on a synthpad.  The combination of happiness and a synth helps give the idea that this is an anime that isn't a dark witch anime, but rather a bright sided one.  The ED is by far my favorite thing of this anime.  Witch Activity is super catchy, fast-paced song that sums up everything that the these villains are, evil, but not truly evil. The ED itself awarded this score of a 9, it's just something about the song that makes me play it on replay.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was lacking.  It did not ave enough impact for it to be memorable and never really helped carry a mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe characters that made this anime were the 5 Tower Witches you get introduced to in the first and second episode.  They are very similar to the Team Rocket trio in where they appear villainous only to become comedic jokes throughout the series.  The only difference is that there Tower Witches are more entertaining to watch than the Rocket trio.  The Witches are serious at parts so they have to be taken seriously at times, unlike the Rocket trio where they aren't taken seriously after episode 1.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development... was lacking for the main characters.  The main character didn't really develop a new way of thinking but rather just gained information about the new world while Kagari didn't develop much besides giving more freedom to Takamiya.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nWith a story that is quite generic, I was surprised that I enjoyed this anime.  Most of my enjoyment came from scenes involving the Tower Witches but the main characters were also quite interesting to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nWitch Craft Works was an anime that surprised me as I thought it would be quite a dark show.  I was assuming that it would involve mages killing mages constantly trying to protect the important things.  Though this is right, it was nowhere near as dark as I imagined it and I was glad to give this anime a shot.",

            "content": "Recently, magical school anime seem to be very popular. Witch Craft Works is not much different, except it has magicians attending school alongside non-magical people. Our main protagonist, Takamiya, at first doesn't know about any of this. He just keeps to himself and avoids getting involved with people until the most popular girl, Kagari also known as Hime (princess), forcefully gets involved in his high school life. It turns out that Takamiya actually has vast magical potential hidden inside of him that evil witches want and would kill him to obtain, so Kagari (who is a witch) must protect him. And she does an excellentjob of protecting him considering she's an extremely overpowered magician with fire magic that can instantly obliterate half a city. Too bad her personality isn't as interesting as her magic, but oh well, it's still fun to watch her destroy stuff emotionlessly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Witch Craft Works jumps around a lot. Each episode is very fast paced and the story is always moving in one way or another (whether it has any effect on the plot or not). This results in certain parts of the story being very entertaining, while others are just annoying and bizarre.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I dislike most about this series, though, is the first episode. I thought this series was going to be absolutely terrible after I watched it. It takes every high school anime cliche (popular girl, guy getting beaten up for being around her, transfer students, etc) to the annoying extreme. The bullying part was especially stupid (and why is one bully named Obama?) because it was portrayed in a humorous way, but it just made you feel bad for Takamiya. However, after the first episode, most of these aspects are forgotten and don't affect the story at all, so it's not too much of a problem overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is a little too large for it's own good and tends to introduce unimportant characters as if they will be important. Takamiya and Kagari are really the only characters given proper introductions. These two are decent protagonists, but they don't bring anything new to plate. Kagari I found to be very boring both in every aspect aside from her overpowered magic abilities, and Takamiya is a generic protagonist who doesn't want anyone to get hurt. It also does a poor job of introducing some of the more important villains. The five initial comedic relief villains are just there for the hell of it since they do nothing except be funny and be in the ED. Another villain, Medusa (I'm sure you can easily guess what her powers are), is also just kind of there and doesn't do anything except make Takamiya develop more. Takamiya's younger sister who fights over him with Kagari is the only other memorable character. The rest are mostly unimportant or are introduced towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this anime is actually it's best aspect. The action and aerial scenes are stunning and the CG really isn't too bad, and at times it's meant to look funny anyway. The character designs aren't the best, and I didn't care for Kagari's design, but they're certainly not bad. Some of the more magical scenes also look splendid with vivid colors and crazy designs. And the magic itself looks great, especially Kagari's overpowered fire magic. If you like fire a lot, you'll at least like one part of this show. The music is good with an excellent OP and a strange yet catchy ED. The soundtrack during the action sequences fits them very well but other than that not much stands out.\\n\\n\r\nWitch Craft Works is pretty average in my opinion. It looks great, but some of the story is just random and strange and the characters needed more time to develop with a smaller cast of actually relevant characters. Too many characters are introduced quickly late in the show and too many are introduced for too long in the beginning only to fade out of importance by the end. The final villain was especially terribly introduced, and the show made it seem like the villain was just a precursor villain for the real one except that that wasn't the case. Takamiya's power could have also used a better explanation, but I'm not sure even he knows exactly what his power is either. But even with all those problems, it's not a bad show and it was fairly entertaining.",

            "content": "Magic exists. Maybe it doesn\u2019t in real life but it\u2019s a phenomenal power of curiosity that exists in the world of Witch Craft Works. It\u2019s not natural because people can\u2019t just be born with it. However, it is like an essence that becomes infused with the show itself. For our normal male protagonist, Takamiya Honoka, his typical life will never be the same again after coming head to head with magic. \r\nAs a series based on fantasy with supernatural elements, expect several attributes that defines this anime: magic, witchcraft, and competence. Well to be perfectly honest, Witch Craft Works shouldn\u2019t be judged by its meritsof premise. There\u2019s nothing distinctive about it. We have the normal boy, Takamiya Honoka who meets the idol (queen or princess as referred by others) at school known to many as Kagari Ayaka. Their meeting isn\u2019t very normal with the circumstances after she reveals herself as a witch. It\u2019s a trite formula used over and over in series similar to this. \\n\\n\r\nWitch Craft Works doesn\u2019t escape a sea of cliches in any way. Rather, it classically defines it with its dull protagonist, Takamiya. There\u2019s literally nothing special about the boy as many characters throughout the series sees him as the \u2018average Joe\u2019. On the other hand, we have a queen at school named Kagari Ayaka that serves as Takamiya\u2019s antithesis. Almost everyone at school literally worships and tries to get on her good side. The show emphasizes the idea that she is their Goddesses while Takamiya is viewed as nothing more than a sidekick, or even a servant. Some may even think Takamiya blackmailed their \u2018queen\u2019 into being his friend/accomplice. And in essence, their relationship is monotonous. It isn\u2019t just defined by their interactions or cheesy dialogues but rather by their lack of connection. There\u2019s almost nothing compatible between the duo whether it\u2019d be their traits, abilities, or status. More than anything, we only know that Kagari wishes to protect him with her life. Throughout the series, it does spark some curiosity as to what this may be. Otherwise, their relationship is about stone cold as a boulder lacking any features of enthrallment.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Takamiya\u2019s life now gets entangled with witches, magecraft, and a whole hoard of envious student unions. The story seems to focus on his life and what changes now from where it stands. On the surface, his life can be defined as a being in jeopardy now. This is because there\u2019s a secret that lies within Takamiya that makes other witches want to hunt him down. Think of it as a \u2018treasure hunt\u2019. Takamiya is the treasure while the witches are the hunters. While it does focus on a cat-and-mouse style of formula on occasions, the hype quickly dies out. Most of the characters, or rather witches can hardly make an effort against Takamiya thanks to the presence of Kagari. It isn\u2019t the fact that the witches are weak but rather Kagari who is abnormally strong. With a witch\u2019s hat, armed with her magic wand, and fiery attitude, there\u2019s almost nothing that can stop her from achieving her goal. Perhaps there is something that can stop her: Takamiya himself. If either of the duo are separated, it becomes a become problem for the duo as Takamiya would be unable to protect himself properly. This is where the clich\u00e9s comes in involving other characters trying to separate the duo. When that happens, we get a black comedy level of violence. Surprisingly, it does feel serious with the mood characterized by the action. On the other hand, the results are often predictable because of various circumstances. What you likely expect is what you will get: the typical paradox of friendship conquers all.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the show isn\u2019t necessarily colored entirely by friendship per se. Although the duo isn\u2019t very compatible, there\u2019s some romanticism going on. It\u2019s not easy to notice in this series because the two main characters contrasts too much from each other. Because Kagari is often the one saving Takamiya, it\u2019s also easy to notice that she is the senior of their relationship. Not only that but she holds authority at school and has a commanding presence. The good news is that the show doesn\u2019t depict them as a master/slave relationship. The bad news is that their relationship lacks connection. It doesn\u2019t characterizes itself as anything as sui generis. It\u2019s quite obvious to see how much Kagari dedicates herself to protect Takamiya beyond her line of duty. Whether her attraction towards the young boy is romantic or not remains anonymous because they don\u2019t connect in a way a normal couple should be. Furthermore, the series falls with the classic imouto, or otherwise \u2018little sister\u2019 trope involving Takamiya\u2019s sister. It won\u2019t take long for you to figure out that she holds some peculiar affections towards her brother. While it doesn\u2019t necessarily go into an incestuous route, Takamiya\u2019s sister resorts to violence to get what she wants. It defiles what an average family relationship should be while lengthening the gap between the siblings. \\n\\n\r\nMagic is prominent theme in the show because it defines the essence that the witches use throughout each episode. There\u2019s no official class or order that gives ranks to any of the witches. Some of the witches are categorized by types. Yet most often, Kagari just takes the stage and presents the testament of her powers. This brings a problem involving the other witches with their characterization. Only a few of them gets moments to shine with back stories with the most obvious being Kagari. That aside, the action the witches perform throughout the show does offer some memorable moments. Spells are thrown in the air with passion and often envelops a fight with its mystical aura. The fantasy element is credible with the bizarre bunny knights, transformations, and even artistic bomb explosives. The premise also takes itself seriously with actual magical content and emphasis on Takamiya\u2019s development in magical arts. Finally, Kagari can pull out some terrific performances from her hat thanks to her talent.\\n\\n\r\nTaken for granted, Witch Craft Works has the artistic style of a generic series. Takamiya looks normal, perhaps too normal to be defined as a distinctive character. There\u2019s literally nothing that stands out about him in physical characteristics. Kagari is the one that stands out the most with her witches hat, outfit, and attitude. Thankfully, the witches can also be distinctive judged by their physical standards. Most of them are decorated with flamboyant outfits that actually make them look like witches. Even the creatures they summon can be fun to get used to by their nature. J.C. Staff handles the series\u2019 production and plays out its theme correctly. However, there are some moments where the artistic style can be unfitting. In particular, there are usage of computer generated graphics during flight scenes of the backgrounds (i.e. buildings, cars, etc). \\n\\n\r\nMusic and soundtrack is noticeable throughout the series. There\u2019s a magical tone of its OST during scenes when mechanics of witchcraft is explained, most noticeably by Kagari. Soundtrack during action scenes is also consistent on most parts. Spells are also chanted that offers credibility of its themes with words that seems fitting. However, Takamiya once again becomes a problem that holds the characters\u2019 cast back. His voice stands out as dull and annoying. His role throughout the series makes it hard to endure for his lazy attitude and distressing responses. Otherwise, music plays the more fun element of this show in particular with its comedic ED song. It transforms the idea of torture into a parody based on its sensational lyrics. The OST also has a mystical aura behind its tone that may draw you in to the show.\\n\\n\r\nAn attempt to enjoy Witch Craft Works will be difficult if you dislike the main male protagonist, Takamiya. Even many characters in the series dislikes him for his normalcy and dullness. Also, expect the expected as most of the story will feel like a predictable trifle of what you may be used to for its generics. Do not expect major plot twists or deep characterization. Rather, just take for what is granted \u2013 a magical story between a normal boy and an abnormal with. Emphasis on the abnormal. \\n",

Witch! \r\nBueno, this anime has just ended, so how do I find it, well, I just gonna present my ratings without anymore BS, so, here are my ratings for each of this anime's category:\r\nGood 7: Story and Sound.\r\nStory:  I gave the story such rating co'z at one point I admire the girl protecting guy from harm kind of thing, I guess this is one anime where the girls havethe balls while the guys.......or guy were in skirts, however unlike other animes with such theme, this one has the girl falling in love with the guy and not treating him like shit and the girl itself wasn't treated like a nuisance. However, it's plot, thought it was suppose to be something that was exaggerated was turned into like rocket science where one could find it difficult as to the circumstances as to how the girl was linked to the boy and how the contract thingy works with the girl's madre who has the task of protecting the city. Also, there are a lot of conflicting situation as to distinguishing the difference between the antagonist and the protagonist even though this anime was meant to focus on the relationship between the girl and the boy. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Ok, for the most part, I kinda like most of the voice actors who portrayed the character's in this anime, but the one who did Chronoire's voice, well I think it doesn't fit her given that in this anime she is a hundred something years old witch, where in my opinion she should have been given a more matured voice. Also, I don't like the opening song, but I do like the closing, WITCH, WITCH.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDecent 4: \\n\\n\r\nArt: For the most part, everything was just too fancy, except the school uniform that them girls were wearing since I like its simplicity, but I got to hand it, this anime has no fanservice for the doggies to how about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8:\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Here, I admire Kagari for being this head strong girl who'd be willing to go to any extent to keep Honoka from harm, I also like the way that she acts as a mother figure to the guy, despite of the fact that she is suppose to be the guy's love interest.\\n\\n\r\nHonoka on one hand.......hummm, I do find him annoying at times, but I like the part that he has such integrity of not wanting to depend on Kagari and would rather see her safe that having to go to such effort of protecting him.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Ivory Quintet, well they do provide the comedy aspect of this anime and so as the guy's sister.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFair 6:\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was enjoyable, but understanding as to what is what and who is who about this anime makes look like rocket science even though this anime's genre was romance, magic, supernatural and action.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It wasn't that bad, however, as to how's and what's in this anime basically lacks a more simplistic explanations, but still it's ok to such extent and I'm not saying anything anymore. Adios chicos y chicas.   \\n\\n",

            "content": "I could not wait to write a review for this garbage can.  I will eviscerate this pile of crap and hopefully you will avoid at all costs.  Unless of course you're a masochist.\r\nI'll get to the point.  The main character is one of the most pathetic, sniveling, whiny, weak, pieces of crap i have bore witness to.  Not once does he man up, and the only time he does something actually somewhat noble, he's crying throughout.  For example, one character is dying, all he has to do is kiss the character to ressurect the character.  He decided to sniveland cry and whine for about 5 minutes.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's a point at which the pathetic-ness of a character reaches a point that you stop caring, usually i would have turned it off except I felt a payoff was due, i sat through over half of it, i was going to see it through, so why didn't i turn it off.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a certain plot device in anime, movies, tv, that is meant to build the suspense and anxiety, this particular device makes me rage.  In WCW, it reached such an absurd point that my soul actually left my body.  Imagine having super powers, there is an evil villian that comes to your town, destroys everything, tortures your friends, and then kills everyone.  You would think that if you had a slight advantage you would take it and dispose of this person.\\n\\n\r\nIn WCW, the villains come into town, devise evil, the main characters beat them up a little bit and then walk away leaving the villains half beat up.  Ofc they are villains, so naturally they go away and come back.  At what point should you expect the main characters to at least tie them up?  Nothing breaks immersion or even suspension of disbelief more than something so absurdly unbelieveable as letting the villains go.  I understand you might not want to kill them, i mean, they only killed everyone in town and destroyed everything.  Let them go.  The last episode of the trash bag, this probably happened about 10 times. In a row.  To the point where they would beat the villain up, turn around and start chatting to each other, and then the villain would get up right behind their backs and attack them again.  and everytime they did this, the attacks got more and more heinous until the villain actually killed both of them.  Oh, if it wasn't for love the heroes wouldn't have ressurected.  alas.\\n\\n\r\nSo after the villain literally stabs the main character in the back, she regrets what she's done so she uses magic to heal the mc a little bit and then walks right out in front of like 20 of their friends.  And she just walks away and they have no intention of doing anything to her.  Their jails in this show get broken out of by everyone who gets put in them.  Literally, everyone that ever gets put in jail in this show breaks out immediately.  Seriously what is the point?  The villains basically shit all over everyone and they love it.  I mean this is an anime for extreme masochists.  Japan is doing a great job teaching this shit to people.\\n\\n\r\nHow am i supposed to feel about this?  The protagonists were terrible to watch, the most uninteresting piles of crap i've ever seen.  The \"villains\" were the only redeeming factor in this entire show.  AND NOBODY WON ANYTHING.  Nothing was resolved, none of it even made any sense.  All of it was avoidable.  Every single plan that the evil doers plotted was obviously preventable.  The show didn't hide it, they wanted you to know that.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat was the story here?  MC has power, everyone tries to protect that power, everyone fails miserably, and then nothing happens.  I don't think i've ever felt this enraged after a show before.  I hope you didn't read all of this, but if you did, the moral to this story is stay away unless you can enjoy the fake, lazy suspense that the MC's create by doing virtually nothing and acting so naive and unreasonable that you have to suspect this entire show was written ad hoc on the back of a bar coaster.\\n\\n\r\nGood night.",

            "content": "This is a show which I thought would kind of separate from other mediocre shows with bland characters, bland plot, and uninspired animation. I was kind of right in watching this show.\r\nLet me first start out with the plot.\r\nThe story is not too bad. really. It's not, but it's not a gem either. To summarize... Some bountiful white bitch who refers to him as \"himesama\" or \"princess\" must protect him from this group of witches.. who have animal ears.. and stuff. That is pretty much the only distinction between them and the friendly witch group who is supposed to protect the main character.\r\nstuff happens, maincharacters gets attacked, and the hime to the himesama saves the day once again. Woopdeedoo! Why should I care? Once again, we are not informed of this strong power inside of this main character person the evil witches are after until the last episode. It doesn't even enlighten you as to why there are two separate witch factions and why animal-ears faction is targeting the city. Which leaves you wondering \"what the fuck is going on right now?\" half way through the show. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, just something I'd like to note: Does this anime realize how many buildings were crushed or blown up throughout this series? Enough to warrant a declaration of a terrorist attack. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to grade art and animation seperately then I'd give art a 9 out of 10. The animation however.. is pretty inconsistent to be frank. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is really good.. in some instances anyway. One scene that comes to mind is at some point in the very first episode. You get to see Kagari (the hime to the himesama or just that one heroine in the show) do some Cuuuurraaaazy spins and flame wheel attacks with her broom. It was really nice, I liked it. It gave me hope for the show. But as the show went on, I noticed how lazy J.C. Staff was being. (JCS also did K-Project or K for short) K is a pretty good anime. Not gonna lie but god damn did they mess up the fight animations. They did these pregenerated attack sequences with some of the main characters and it just didn't look well at all and not to mention the still frames... Well, I can strongly say that WCW was a step up from that but it definitely varies. \\n\\n\r\nThe monster (Giant rabbits and bears) animation looks GREAT I must say. I found myself really enjoying king kong one-on-one battles between two giant monsters (and its CG btw). It was very fluent and hilarious at times to see these wonderful scenes. However even though they did better with (some of) their fight scenes, the witch battles still varied from great to slightly average to still frames which I guess you could chock of to bad budget. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest offender of this that I can think of would have to be the second to last episode (without spoiling anything). There is a scene where heroine girl is fighting with the evil villain person-witch gal and it just goes into this 3rd person perspective of heroine gal for no goddly reason and basically she is just dodging all these explosions. It comes off as choppy and amateurish.\\n\\n\r\nSo to summarize, in some aspects as impressed with JCS's improvements and in others I was pretty disappointed with their slip-ups.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nPretty nice, however there is dat ED... There were so many times I would force myself to watch this brain tumor of a song. Words can not describe how much I despise it (not that's bad.. but good lord is it bad).\\n\r\n I'm not much of a musicoholic so can't say much else here. Hi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nMain character was kind of annoying, heroine was okay. All the sub characters are pretty dumb but some of them are quite interesting (Some). oh, and theres the yandere sister... Yahh. Also did not see any character development, the MC was a wuss through and through to the end. And the heroine was still just an overpowered silent hoe.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nDespite some flaws in budget, story and character development it was still pretty enjoyable but nothing I'd encourage for others to watch. But if you want to try it out, then go ahead. You won't be dissapointed but not so much awwed either.\\n\\n\r\nIf you found my review helpful (or not) then leave a like or whatever you do on this site and also leave me feedback so I can know what not to do or do in reviews in the future (I am not a writer for god's sake!) :)",

            "content": "Witch Craft Works is honestly a hard anime to review in my opinion. It contains a lot of cliches, standard anime stock characters, and has moments when 3D CGI is used to help stretch the animation budget. The 12 episodes cover a good bit of story but when the ride is over it feels a bit overwhelming as a whole, yet I highly enjoyed WCW. Is it because I expected this to be another run of the mill harem anime and turned out to be a quirky fantasy romance? That I can't truly say.\r\nWhat I can say about WCW is this: it's fun. While amajority of characters are the usual recycled stock characters, they have enough spice to them to keep them all interesting and they all work extremely well together which is something that a few too many anime fails to work out. The animation excluding the meh CGI moments is incredibly good and one of my personal favorite touches for the anime was how colorful it was just to look at, but a good anime has to have more than a pretty face right?\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned that the story feels a bit underwhelming, after all while most loose ends are explained they are so quickly brushed aside and conflicts end up so easily resolved it often feels like everything leading up to it was just for flashy show rather than story substance. However at the same time it almost works to its advantage where in its 12 episode run it doesn't feel like there are any leftovers that would beckon for a second season. Setting out on what it wants to do and finishing by the final time the ED rings out is something a lot of one cour anime have trouble with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have to say personally this was the surprise of the winter season for me. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did and found myself really loving all the characters in it and having a few good laughs along the way. WCW may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something familiar but different at the same time I would highly recommend WCW.",

            "content": "Witch Craft Works (WCW) was something of a dark horse for me. I was neither expecting to watch it, or even think that I would enjoy it once I actually started. Time, as it seems, has proven me wrong in both regards.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story to WCW is simple and not very complex, and is by no means the strong suit to this magic-endowed action/comedy. However, it is paced well enough, and crafted well enough to get you drawn in to what might happen next. \r\nArt: 8\r\nThe artistic part to WCW is easily one of the noticeably better parts to this anime, with well-designed backgrounds, characterdesigns, effects and 3D animated inserts that don't look like a kitten thrown in a lion's den. Most of the backgrounds are strikingly beautiful, while others are rather plain, but all of the art fits well and has a great color palate. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound design, music and voice acting is another good point to this show. WCW puts its interesting OST to good use, and manages to accompany its scenes well without standing out too much. The voice acting I think could use some work with some of the minor characters, but overall the cast did a good performance, fitting in with the style of their characters fairly well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow to the characters. I really like the centric characters to this story, and while a few of them might not be very unique, I find them endearing. Expect for one, that is. My main beef with this show's character lists is how they handled the main character. For the most part, Takamiya felt like he was just a tool to advance the story, and there weren't very many times were I felt like he was actually doing something, which is rather disappointing considering he is the 'main' character. Alternatively, Kagari was a very good character. Serious to the point of being funny, she represents, in my mind, the core feeling of WCW and why I found it so enjoyable. Another favorite character of mine is Weekend, who is a good example of a weak-but-dangerous villain.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall & Enjoyment: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are many elements that WCW does plenty well: Art, Sound and Characters are done better than the rest, if I say so myself. Fantastic backdrops and some good-quality artworks accents the odd and not very serious tone that the story creates, with sound adding on to the oddity that is Witch Craft Works. Overall, I found it to be a surprisingly enjoyable show. Serious humor (one of my favorite kinds) and the enjoyable ridiculousness of this show is something that I definitely ask of you to try.",

For one i believe a lot of clich\u00e9 situation were used on this serie as a method of comedy relief. Don`t get me wrong i really enjoyed the occasional joke and i laughed at this serie plenty of times myself, however i believe some of them were a little to obvious.\r\nThe plot of this serie however I loved. I like how it was thetypical story (guy appears normal but has a secret power) but with a twist,putting focus not only to the main character but the situation around him, the witches.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art in this serie was pretty good, simple but efficient not to mention that there were plenty of bright colours,well flowing action scenes and sceneries that were very enticing. I believe it lived up well to the standard of modern anime.\\n\\n\r\nsound:\\n\r\nI love the opening to this serie, its fun, catchy and i think it matches the theme of this anime serie perfectly. The ending was just as good and i love how each witch sang their own part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI find it really hard to judge the characters to this serie because on one side they are quite typical but at the same time their not. I feel like although quite a few clich\u00e9s were used i do believe they were used with a twist, a way to make they slightly different from the rest. for example Kagari Ayaka I loved her SO much i thought she was funny and unpredictable, however in the end she just plays the emotionless character... but when it comes to takamiya kun her persona took an unexpected turn that made her so memorable.\\n\r\nI do believe Takamiya kun could have had more of a background considering he was suppose to be the main character.... in the end i think i actually found him the least memorable.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this serie and i really hope there will be a season 2\\n\\n\r\noverall:\\n\r\nits funny, has a good plot and i would definitely recommend it",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT* All I have to say is, so someone's life is on the line, and you can't kiss them on the lips, until you are married??? what is he, 5 years old?? Why does every anime hold kisses on such a grand level like they are about to get married? Most of the show was good but the last episode really annoyed me. Someone that you have feelings for died for you, and they add kind of a comedic part, of him joking around about how embarrassing it is to kiss someone. I guess i might understand a little if he was too embarrassedto do it in a normal situation but for him to think like that when someone is about to die is absurd.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that part, i think the story was good. There are many animes that are so similar that you couldn't tell them apart if they had the same name, but there very few anime that use the \"older girl\" type feeling. Also the story, and the direction  it went was a little different from most as well. Many might complain that no one died, but this is a lighthearted type story, and it would make the story too dark if someone really did die. Even the villains on the show did not give off such  a dark vibe.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could add something to the show, i wish the show could have been longer, and it would have been kind of cool to see the MC learning how to fight on his own. At first i thought that was going to happen when he asked her to train him, but in the end she was too protective of him to train him other than teaching him how to run away if something went wrong.\\n\\n\r\nIf someone asked me if they should watch the show, i would say it depends on what they are looking for. If they are looking for a full on romance, or a combat type show, i would not recommend it because in the end they never really are together. But if you like a lighthearted romance that never tells the watcher that they like each other but the watcher understands by watching it, it is a perfect show to watch. This is the type of shows i look forward to every seasons while waiting for the 9 or 10 rating anime to finish.",

The story is pretty unique in its own right, but I don't think it had enough time to develop fully or to its fullest being just 12 eps long. The characters mesh together very well, and there wasn't that traditional relationship that usually exists between the lead male and female characters within the plot. The animation was pretty superb. Overall, this series was very enjoyable and I hope to see a season 2! If you are looking for something thatis fairly unique, and has a story that will draw you in...This should be on your list!",

            "content": "The character design and fight scenes alone make Witch Craft Works worth watching, but if you're expecting any sort of original or gripping story, you're going to be disappointed.\r\nThe worldbuilding is your generic Magic-Land-With-No-Apparent-Consistent-Logic-Behind-Magic-Use-And-Abilities, which *definitely* weakens the story. The series also relies a little too much on the whole, \"we're going to hide things about everyone's past to make stuff seem mysterious and dramatic\" to create suspense, instead of doing it with good storytelling. \r\nThat being said, the character designs in this series are awesome. Nearly every character (except for the two MCs, really) are imaginative and fun, which brings a lot to theenjoyment factor of the series. The animated fights are also done very well -- I actually kinda liked the use of CGI in Witch Craft Works. The music and sound are also great.\\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun with the earlier episodes in the series, but when it started to get a bit more 'serious' toward the end there, I found myself getting bored. The shift away from character-based episodes and toward plot-based episodes definitely highlighted the weakness of show. I pretty much made myself finish the final two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: if you're looking for a solid plot with some interesting twists, keep walking. If you want to have some fun with cool characters, magic/explosions, and decent fight scenes, sit for a spell and give Witch Craft Works a shot.",

            "content": "It`s somewhat rare nowadays that I stumble across an anime that isn`t based on some sort of manga, visual novel, video game, book, etc. Most anime of the late years have taken up this trend of creating an animation for ideas and plots that already exist.\r\nThis is not to say that anything`s wrong with that. Anime, of course, is another way to create a larger fanbase of the original thing or idea the anime was created upon. Some anime are created which crash and burn compared to the original product, while others soar above the sales of what was originally being advertised. There are someanime, or some gems, rather, which are looked over quite quickly, and never become as popular as they should. While these specific gems aren`t perfect, they aren`t incredibly terrible either. Not every gem is the shiniest or prettiest gem out there, but maybe, just maybe, it does have that extra sparkle or gleam which makes it so much better once investigated upon further.\\n\\n\r\nWitch Craft Works is one of these gems.\\n\\n\r\n~\\n\\n\r\nWitch Craft Works is about a high school student by the name of Honoka Takamiya, a rather regular character who is just passing by his life as quickly and as slowly as everyone else. The most popular girl in school, with great grades, great athletic ability, and great body, that goes by the name of Ayaka Kagari, is always by or near him, causing him discomfort as her raging fans constantly poke or prod at him, annoying Takamiya to no end. One day, Takamiya becomes the victim of a witch looking to steal his power, and she attacks him with her army of mechanical bunnies. Takamiya nearly succumbs to his death as a school building plummets towards him, but he saved by none other than the Fire Witch, and his pretty classmate, Ayaka Kagari. Takamiya acts as the `damsel in distress`, while Kagari is his `knight in shining armor`. The show is based around Kagari protecting her `princess`, as she calls Takamiya, and fighting other witches that are trying to steal Takamiya`s immense power within him. Together, Kagari is unstoppable because of Takamiya.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is pretty original and enjoyable as it unfolds. While there are quite a few plot-holes plaguing the anime, and ideas which are never expanded upon, the regular high school setting with fantastical witches is pretty impressive. It`s not a show that you`ll get serious or dark themes from. It`s carefree, funny, and bright, and stays that way, even when the show gets a bit more intense. The anime usually sets itself up for complex and extensive concepts about the story, but it never takes the chance to grasp upon them. Witch Craft Works is usually much too busy focusing on other things within the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of things it focuses on, Witch Craft Works takes pride in its own animation. The show is absolutely gorgeous, whether it be during fight scenes, regular slice-of-life events, or comedic clips, this anime knows how to begin, transition, and end with its animation. The drawings and settings are completely breath-taking, and the designs for almost all of the characters are charmingly over-the-top and fitting with the story itself. Everything is a plethora of color, while not being too annoying or in your face about the color scheme. It`s bright and happy, and the art will most definitely not leave you disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nWitch Craft Works also takes special consideration in its soundtrack. The music fits very well with the anime itself, but there are only a few which particularly stand alone, and could be listened to on any given day while not watching the show. I thoroughly enjoyed the opening, in both the animation and the singing, but my favorite was the ending. The ED is so catchy and happy-go-lucky, nestling itself in with the mood of the show almost spot-on. I can almost guarantee that it will be stuck in your head for quite some time.\\n\\n\r\nWhile both the animation and sound are superb, the characters are a little worse for wear. While I really adore the gender role reversal of the `princess and her knight`, the trope is what`s really focused on in comparison to the characters. Takamiya is comparatively bland, as most damsels are, and his backstory isn`t actually worked on throughout the course of the anime. Kagari is at somewhat of the same downfall, considering she is just like the quiet and stoic type of character, showing her badassery quite often, but never revealing more than that. Sure, her past is looked upon, but it mostly has to do with Takamiya, and nothing else. I love the dynamic between the two mains, but while the rest of the characters look really cool, there`s nothing special or superb about them.\\n\\n\r\n~\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I really had to think about whether or not to give this anime a seven or an eight. Personally, I`m a bit biased on gender roles reversed, considering I absolutely love when they are performed and done correctly. Sure, Witch Craft Works did a pretty good job on it, but I know some people aren`t as happy with that sort of dynamic focus in the anime. If I were to compare this show to something, it would be like...... It was mostly like a shonen anime, but with all of the genders switched around. And no. Damn. Harem. (For the most part)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while I loved every second of this happy, funny, optimistic show, the story just wasn\u2019t all there. At the end of the day, it was just another anime with great potential that was never expanded upon. Sure, I loved it, but it`s not the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen. If I were to recommend it, which I`m going to, I would say that it`s sort of like a `let`s take a break` anime. Something to watch in between intense anime or really lengthy anime. While I liked it, the only thing I can hope for is a second season, and character development.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7.5/10",

            "content": "I first encountered Witch Craft a few years back on a certain manga site. To my delight, last year it had an animation. It\u2019s been my principle to NOT watch on-going shows, so I\u2019m always late on what\u2019s happening. You see, I just don\u2019t like being left with cliff hangers. Anyway, let\u2019s get on with my ever-so-late review.\r\nStory: 7\r\nWith all honesty, I find Witch Craft\u2019s plot very similar with a lot of seinen series out there. And when I mean similar, It\u2019s your average hi-I\u2019m-the-protagonist-who\u2019s-a-normal-student-who-gets-joined-up-with-a-pretty-complicated-situation. Don\u2019t get me wrong, though! It is not a bad thing. I mean, there are no two exact same thingsin this world, except zubats and dugtrios in a cave. Kidding aside, like I\u2019ve said before, Witch Craft\u2019s plot isn\u2019t that unique.\\n\r\nThe show is about witches, (thanks, Captain Obvious!) and Takamiya Honoka our princess\u2014I mean our male MC. Takamiya is your regular high-school student who happens to sit and rides the same bus every single day with the most popular girl in his school Kagari Ayaka. One day, he takes out the trash from their room and disaster strikes our MC! Oh, don\u2019t worry; it\u2019s just a minor problem. It\u2019s just a part of the school building\u2026 That\u2019ll fall on his head. Of course, we wouldn\u2019t want to end the show with just one episode and let Takamiya die. By unknown reasons, he was saved by Kagari Ayaka. And everything about his normal life will turn around because of this event. What will happen to Takamiya\u2019s everyday regular life? Find out and watch it yourself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nLike I\u2019ve said with all my previous reviews, we will rarely see unpleasant art these modern days. Back with Witch Craft\u2019s; its art is nothing short of magnificent. Every bit is detailed, from the characters to the cute penguins, cats, rabbits, bears, snakes, which constantly appear background. Witch Craft\u2019s art is respectable, period.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nSound or music is a vital part of how good a series can be, too. From the special sound effects to the opening themes and closing themes, everything can be added up to judge how a series would turn to. As for Witch Craft\u2019s, it\u2019s sound effects during fight scenes were fine. What draws my attention was the ending theme done by the antagonist-esque five-women-group made titled, \u201cWitch Activity\u201d. Its upbeat tune made me gaga, and dance like a retard. Forget I said that. Anyway, the OP\u2019s not that bad, either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI like the way the characters turned out in the animation. When I first read the manga I thought that Kagari Ayaka was a guy. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t even think she was a she if not for her big \u201cplots\u201d. Back to the animation, everyone had a stable role in the show; distinctive personality to match themselves and flawless picking of Seiyuu to voice them. The development of the characters weren\u2019t that bad at all.\\n\r\nIt seems like Takamiya has a knack for being unconscious every episode and when he wakes up, he shouts Kagari-san almost always. It\u2019s not that bad, though, considering it\u2019s a light seinen (more like a shounen for me) series from the start and he seems like to possess every being and characteristic of an idjet MC. \\n\r\nThe blending from both the female MC and male MC is good, too. Although, I think they\u2019ve been switched. With the entire cool-beauty aura surrounding Kagari and the feminine side of Takamiya who loves penguins. They complement each other well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed Witch Craft Works a bit more than I should. It\u2019s definitely one of the better shows I\u2019ve seen so far. Everyone has a genre they prefer to watch. As for me, I am a fan of these kinds of show, so you can say I\u2019m a bit biased here. I don\u2019t want to sound overacting on how I liked the show and making your expectation of it high, so I\u2019ll stop here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nOverall, Witch Craft Works\u2019 is not a superb show. But I\u2019m not gonna deny its entertainment value. It was able to amuse me. And the other thing I liked about it was the light-hearted theme it possesses, unlike other dark-themed seinen shows out there. Tbh, I think it should be changed into a shounen rather than seinen. There are a lot of questions in need of answers, so I\u2019m expecting a season two or some sort of sequel to it. All in all, Witch Craft Works is not a bad show. It won\u2019t blow you off like other big-time series out there, but it\u2019ll definitely pique your interest.\\n",

            "content": "The art style of the anime is... rather silly. Like seriously, who creates giant pink teddybears with a summoning spell?!\r\nAnyways the story and the characters are amazing! This anime is exactly what happens when you have a standard shonen/sword&sorcery anime, where you swap genders. To top it off, the boy who always needs the saving is even called Princess!\r\nIt gets very funny and the fights are not bad either. I like how they are deliberately making fun of the \"enemy\" witches. Remember Team Rocket from Pokemon? Kinda like that. Other than that, the anime should likes to make fun of out little \"princess\". In yourtypical \"damsel in distress\" story this time the boy is the one who needs the saving all the time.\\n\\n\r\nKagura, the other main character, is your hero from your shonen manga, but yet again, gender-bent. She's strong, decisive and on-the-point. However, she does show her feminine side, often unexpectedly, which is also one of the things the anime relies on when making jokes. E.g. how she likes to pamper her boyfriends, or wear his shirt (which is super small on her because of her breasts by the way).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also have a normal high-school life though (bet you didn't expect that!). Kagura is the perfect example every girl should strive to be like on high school. The boy however is basically a nobody, a peasant. When he gets together with Kagura, everyone starts hating him, because \"it's not his place\".",

            "content": "For an anime that has a lot of characters for a one season series, the focus is quite firmly on Takamiya Honoka (one of only two males in the series, not that I'm complaining) and Kagari Ayaka, the main characters and practically the heroes of the series, the good guys you're supposed to root for. The story, full of mystery and the unknown at first, progressed nicely for the first 8 episodes, then I lost track of who wanted what and had to ask my younger brother for clarification, which was a bit humbling. The series didn't have much variety to the humorit brought to the episodes, but Kuraishi Tanpopo's karaoke was a blast to watch. The voice actress of Kuraishi, well chosen for her part, gave a sidesplitting performance. It was a scene that I watched again and again, and bolstered the ratings of Witch Craft Works.\\n\\n\r\n  The artwork, and often the computer graphics integrated in the drawing cells was perhaps, maybe, arguably the best I've ever seen in the 30 years I've been watching anime. Of course, anime from the 80's and 90's can't hold a candle to the extravagant and lush and imaginative and fanciful, breathtaking visuals that anime studios bring us these days. The genre of this series must be fantasy. It surpasses even Paprika in terms of trippiness. I say that with a firm assertion. The lowest scores of Witch Craft come in the story and character departments. The big reveal of all this hustle bustle is that not only EVERYTHING comes back to what it was at the start, but EVERYONE also. That is, there's no ending, happy or sad. There's no development from the characters. Ayaka never had much in terms of personality. Her schtick is to be icy, detached, cold but blindly devoted to Takamiya for reasons that are hinted at to tease us, but never revealed. She's the one who stays the most normal during these episodic escapades, and frankly it suits her. It's Honoka that fails lamentably in growing, growing up, evolving any sort of emotion beyond hopelessness and mild stress and confusion. He never grows into the role he has been entrusted. Having frozen everybody's interactions and interface, the story makes everything go back to normal. THAT was hard to take. It was a case of Simpsonland.\\n\\n\r\n  The type of magic used in Witch Craft is about bond and bartering. The bomb girl, Evermilion, a very annoying villain, seemed overpowered and her constant victories seem to undermine the invincible Ayaka. She even took out, seemingly, even Ayaka's powerful mother, who has been subtly and indirectly hyped up as the most powerful witch in that town.The type of magic used, is quite convenient, too much, and servile to the caprice of the story and is subject to the vagaries of the plot. Yet, the visuals are still at the service of the story, unlike most non anime and live action series I've seen. There has been quite some imagination spent into fleshing out this world. The worlds in between, the alternate dimensions are all memorable and intricate. There have been quite a few anime (cough, K, cough), that have put all their onus on the artwork and failed in all other respects. Witch Craft Works is an arresting series with a lot of heart, and I appreciated it very much, proof of which is reflected in my scores and this review. I definitely recommend it and will remember watching it for a long time.",

            "content": "\"Witch Craft Works\" manages to take a few cliches/average plots (weak main male characters surrounded by strong women, some harem, good and evil fighting for the main character because they have immense power they have no idea about, etc) and not completely beat them to death. In fact, they played around with their boundaries, breathed new life into them and all the while told a pretty good story along the way.\r\nHowever, I truly think this show could have benefited from a few more episodes to allow for more development and storytelling, but I think it did well for the small period it had to covereverything. Very little was left unexplained but the full background to Kagari and Takimaya's relationship was cut short and never finished which is rather disappointing. But I also have to commend them for not basing this on the obvious romance that could have erupted between the two main characters, but rather the bond/contract they share and how they have to grow with one another rather than simply being together.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nAs I said before, there's a few cliches, but overall it's enjoyable. It can feel rushed because they want to get all the big points put into 12 episodes, but if you can look past that little detail then watching this series is a breeze.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nAll the art seemed so average to me. Nothing too special, but not particularly bad either. Even my mom commented on the graphics being \"lame\" when she saw what I was watching. And that's all there is to it - the graphic didn't wow me or dazzle me and were just... there. Evermillion, Kagari in full-fledged Fire Witch form and the intricacy of the development of the tattoos on Kagari/Takimaya that would form are the only things that were moderately stunning.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nIt was good, well placed and never overpowering.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThere could have been a little more development in this area. The fact that the tower witches motives were purposefully left so vague worked out at first, but I think individual characters should have made their motives known. I mean, if all of these witches knew about Takimaya then why are they finally attacking now? This is also a failed plot point. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, I do like how they made it seem like Kagari was carefree (which mostly came off as lack of emotion), but would periodically reveal something that showed otherwise through flashbacks and small breaks. Also Kagari and Takimaya are phenomenal foils of each other that meet on certain levels; her lack of emotion is countered by his deep caring and emotional desires to keep everyone safe and their recklessness, for various reasons, show their similarities. \\n\\n\r\nEach witch from their respective side managed to have their own distinct personality and most showed why they were on their particular side.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment of the series is definitely high. At times, the show was extremely cute and at others it kept me engaged in the fights as I wondered how Kagari could do all she did and walk out just fine. And really, the characters were all pretty likable in their own right. \\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this anime. I don't think it's for everyone (but there's not a single anime that is, honestly), but I think it's worth taking a chance with.",

            "content": "Witch Craft Works is a show with tremendous potential and sadly no payoff.\r\nIf I were to tell you that this show had a cohesive story that was tied together tightly with plot lines that expand across multiple episodes I would be blatantly lying to you. Witch Craft Works takes an almost episodic structure and the only thing that ties the show together chronologically is the progression of the characters.\r\nAnd I\u2019m completely okay with that as this show had a large and great cast of characters. The thing that made this show so enjoyable for me was how goofy everyone was. It was very much likeThe Devil is a Part-Timer!Where the characters would normally be taken seriously but instead they are not. Often times these characters feel like actors in a play. Once their scene of fighting is over everyone is friends even living in the same house.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few episodes of plot that take two episodes to resolve but these are few. Any of the drama, action, and suspense this show could have had was removed in lieu of the romance. Which normally I would be alright with, however, that romance had no payoff. If you\u2019re going to remove many of your possible aspects to focus on one thing in particular than whatever you focus on should be damn good. Sadly by the end of Witch Craft Works our wonderful main characters are exactly where they were in the first couple episodes. We just simply understand them better.\\n\\n\r\nI should add this show is getting an OVA in July. When that airs it is possible to change my opinion of the show. However, for now this show is one with high enjoyment but absolutely no payoff, so most of that enjoyment is ruined in the end.",

            "content": "Witch Craft Works! An anime about witches and stuff. An average anime with clich\u00e9 characters and not much of a plot. Even though I say that, it was still an enjoyable watch. With outstanding animation and the great OST, WCW was a nice 12-ep anime which was pretty funny with it's catchy ending song.\r\nStory. 7\r\nThe story is about a normal boy, going to school as always, but then one day the schools most popular girl starts to interact with him. After getting to know her, he learns of her identity as a witch. She tells him about the special \"being\" inside of him and startsto protect him from danger. \\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple in the beginning, but after a while it gets a little better but it's not anything special. There are pretty cool fights sometimes but they don't really go in dept with the story, so don't expect anything extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nArt. 9.5\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is just outstanding as I mentioned before. Well, the characters might look a little weird but the background and all the details are one of the best I've ever seen in an anime. The action scenes are very beatifully drawn while also being epic!\\n\\n\r\nSound. 9\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really good, for real. I like the opening but the ending is just addictive, it's a very catchy song with a bit disturbing video, but it's cute! The voice acting can be a little annoying sometimes but it fits, it gives more of a comedical feeling to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 6.3\\n\\n\r\nWell, there some characters that were pretty cool but were not any of the main characters. Most of the characters are the archetypes and the main character is preeeettyy annoying, but if you're able to see trough that, you'll probably enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 7.8\\n\\n\r\nIt was an enjoyable anime for me and I do not regret watching it, it was very fun at times and the visuals and the BGM was very pleasant. However, it still has a lot of flaws and it isn't a masterpiece. If you are to watch this anime, don't have too high expectations, just think of it as a light hearted anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall. 7.8\\n\\n\r\nIt was definitely worth the watch, but I'm not too fond of these sub-harem animes. The ending was satisfactory but nothing special. The comedy part of this anime can be pretty fun and despite the main characters personality and the lack of plot, the other things makes up for it and it becomes a pleasant enough anime. \\n\\n\r\nSORRY FOR THE BAD ENGLISH. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "An anime where the villains are more entertaining to watch than the main cast, Witch Craft Works takes pages from Pokemon and does it better than Team Rocket.\r\nStory: 7\r\nIn a world with two warring witch guilds, the Workshop Witches and the more evil Tower Witches, our main hero is to be protected by a very strong Workshop Witch.  The typical story of a powerless protagonist to become a strong hero is overdone and things that happen throughout this story are standard to the plot of a rising hero.  There are parts where I was confused on contracts and such, but this comes morefrom my dislike of reading contracts and how a contract could contradict another contract or how establishing a contract can make one null and void.  Reasons why I never will be a lawyer.  \\n\\n\r\nThough I have said that the plot is of a typical rising hero, this common story help set a pacing that was perfect.  The rising hero storyline follows a rollercoaster of pacing, where it starts off slow and precedes to pick up as the main character learns new skills and eventually takes on the main antagonist.  One reason why this type of storyline is slow at the start is because of the pure focus on the main character, going from a weakling to a stronger hero, the pacing reflects that.  Witch Craft Works throws a wrench into that focus on the main hero as his teacher who is strong from the start helps with battles and fighting.  There are training scenes combined with scenes involving the teacher fighting that create a smooth pacing throughout the series.     \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was either super amazing or just super choppy.  Amazing parts include the animation of art and flying, the character designs as well as the designs for the minions and all the details put into the city.  Some choppy parts included a choppy 3D animation at the end, some fighting scenes, especially between minions, looked awkward as well as some explosions appeared to have missing frames.  The proportions for Kagari looks weird as well.. I mean anime with big-boobed characters look normal compared to Kagari... There is somethign about the way she is drawn that doesn't look quite right.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about the art was the use of color.  Monochrome art is something that isn't seen too often but Witch Craft Works uses it exceedingly well.  Certain scenes just blew me away with all the hues and shades used of a color.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OP, \"divine intervention\" was a decent OP that reflected the fantasy aspect of a mages world.  The way it did this was through playing \"happy\" notes on a synthpad.  The combination of happiness and a synth helps give the idea that this is an anime that isn't a dark witch anime, but rather a bright sided one.  The ED is by far my favorite thing of this anime.  Witch Activity is super catchy, fast-paced song that sums up everything that the these villains are, evil, but not truly evil. The ED itself awarded this score of a 9, it's just something about the song that makes me play it on replay.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was lacking.  It did not ave enough impact for it to be memorable and never really helped carry a mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe characters that made this anime were the 5 Tower Witches you get introduced to in the first and second episode.  They are very similar to the Team Rocket trio in where they appear villainous only to become comedic jokes throughout the series.  The only difference is that there Tower Witches are more entertaining to watch than the Rocket trio.  The Witches are serious at parts so they have to be taken seriously at times, unlike the Rocket trio where they aren't taken seriously after episode 1.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development... was lacking for the main characters.  The main character didn't really develop a new way of thinking but rather just gained information about the new world while Kagari didn't develop much besides giving more freedom to Takamiya.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nWith a story that is quite generic, I was surprised that I enjoyed this anime.  Most of my enjoyment came from scenes involving the Tower Witches but the main characters were also quite interesting to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nWitch Craft Works was an anime that surprised me as I thought it would be quite a dark show.  I was assuming that it would involve mages killing mages constantly trying to protect the important things.  Though this is right, it was nowhere near as dark as I imagined it and I was glad to give this anime a shot.",

            "content": "Recently, magical school anime seem to be very popular. Witch Craft Works is not much different, except it has magicians attending school alongside non-magical people. Our main protagonist, Takamiya, at first doesn't know about any of this. He just keeps to himself and avoids getting involved with people until the most popular girl, Kagari also known as Hime (princess), forcefully gets involved in his high school life. It turns out that Takamiya actually has vast magical potential hidden inside of him that evil witches want and would kill him to obtain, so Kagari (who is a witch) must protect him. And she does an excellentjob of protecting him considering she's an extremely overpowered magician with fire magic that can instantly obliterate half a city. Too bad her personality isn't as interesting as her magic, but oh well, it's still fun to watch her destroy stuff emotionlessly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Witch Craft Works jumps around a lot. Each episode is very fast paced and the story is always moving in one way or another (whether it has any effect on the plot or not). This results in certain parts of the story being very entertaining, while others are just annoying and bizarre.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I dislike most about this series, though, is the first episode. I thought this series was going to be absolutely terrible after I watched it. It takes every high school anime cliche (popular girl, guy getting beaten up for being around her, transfer students, etc) to the annoying extreme. The bullying part was especially stupid (and why is one bully named Obama?) because it was portrayed in a humorous way, but it just made you feel bad for Takamiya. However, after the first episode, most of these aspects are forgotten and don't affect the story at all, so it's not too much of a problem overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is a little too large for it's own good and tends to introduce unimportant characters as if they will be important. Takamiya and Kagari are really the only characters given proper introductions. These two are decent protagonists, but they don't bring anything new to plate. Kagari I found to be very boring both in every aspect aside from her overpowered magic abilities, and Takamiya is a generic protagonist who doesn't want anyone to get hurt. It also does a poor job of introducing some of the more important villains. The five initial comedic relief villains are just there for the hell of it since they do nothing except be funny and be in the ED. Another villain, Medusa (I'm sure you can easily guess what her powers are), is also just kind of there and doesn't do anything except make Takamiya develop more. Takamiya's younger sister who fights over him with Kagari is the only other memorable character. The rest are mostly unimportant or are introduced towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this anime is actually it's best aspect. The action and aerial scenes are stunning and the CG really isn't too bad, and at times it's meant to look funny anyway. The character designs aren't the best, and I didn't care for Kagari's design, but they're certainly not bad. Some of the more magical scenes also look splendid with vivid colors and crazy designs. And the magic itself looks great, especially Kagari's overpowered fire magic. If you like fire a lot, you'll at least like one part of this show. The music is good with an excellent OP and a strange yet catchy ED. The soundtrack during the action sequences fits them very well but other than that not much stands out.\\n\\n\r\nWitch Craft Works is pretty average in my opinion. It looks great, but some of the story is just random and strange and the characters needed more time to develop with a smaller cast of actually relevant characters. Too many characters are introduced quickly late in the show and too many are introduced for too long in the beginning only to fade out of importance by the end. The final villain was especially terribly introduced, and the show made it seem like the villain was just a precursor villain for the real one except that that wasn't the case. Takamiya's power could have also used a better explanation, but I'm not sure even he knows exactly what his power is either. But even with all those problems, it's not a bad show and it was fairly entertaining.",

            "content": "Magic exists. Maybe it doesn\u2019t in real life but it\u2019s a phenomenal power of curiosity that exists in the world of Witch Craft Works. It\u2019s not natural because people can\u2019t just be born with it. However, it is like an essence that becomes infused with the show itself. For our normal male protagonist, Takamiya Honoka, his typical life will never be the same again after coming head to head with magic. \r\nAs a series based on fantasy with supernatural elements, expect several attributes that defines this anime: magic, witchcraft, and competence. Well to be perfectly honest, Witch Craft Works shouldn\u2019t be judged by its meritsof premise. There\u2019s nothing distinctive about it. We have the normal boy, Takamiya Honoka who meets the idol (queen or princess as referred by others) at school known to many as Kagari Ayaka. Their meeting isn\u2019t very normal with the circumstances after she reveals herself as a witch. It\u2019s a trite formula used over and over in series similar to this. \\n\\n\r\nWitch Craft Works doesn\u2019t escape a sea of cliches in any way. Rather, it classically defines it with its dull protagonist, Takamiya. There\u2019s literally nothing special about the boy as many characters throughout the series sees him as the \u2018average Joe\u2019. On the other hand, we have a queen at school named Kagari Ayaka that serves as Takamiya\u2019s antithesis. Almost everyone at school literally worships and tries to get on her good side. The show emphasizes the idea that she is their Goddesses while Takamiya is viewed as nothing more than a sidekick, or even a servant. Some may even think Takamiya blackmailed their \u2018queen\u2019 into being his friend/accomplice. And in essence, their relationship is monotonous. It isn\u2019t just defined by their interactions or cheesy dialogues but rather by their lack of connection. There\u2019s almost nothing compatible between the duo whether it\u2019d be their traits, abilities, or status. More than anything, we only know that Kagari wishes to protect him with her life. Throughout the series, it does spark some curiosity as to what this may be. Otherwise, their relationship is about stone cold as a boulder lacking any features of enthrallment.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Takamiya\u2019s life now gets entangled with witches, magecraft, and a whole hoard of envious student unions. The story seems to focus on his life and what changes now from where it stands. On the surface, his life can be defined as a being in jeopardy now. This is because there\u2019s a secret that lies within Takamiya that makes other witches want to hunt him down. Think of it as a \u2018treasure hunt\u2019. Takamiya is the treasure while the witches are the hunters. While it does focus on a cat-and-mouse style of formula on occasions, the hype quickly dies out. Most of the characters, or rather witches can hardly make an effort against Takamiya thanks to the presence of Kagari. It isn\u2019t the fact that the witches are weak but rather Kagari who is abnormally strong. With a witch\u2019s hat, armed with her magic wand, and fiery attitude, there\u2019s almost nothing that can stop her from achieving her goal. Perhaps there is something that can stop her: Takamiya himself. If either of the duo are separated, it becomes a become problem for the duo as Takamiya would be unable to protect himself properly. This is where the clich\u00e9s comes in involving other characters trying to separate the duo. When that happens, we get a black comedy level of violence. Surprisingly, it does feel serious with the mood characterized by the action. On the other hand, the results are often predictable because of various circumstances. What you likely expect is what you will get: the typical paradox of friendship conquers all.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the show isn\u2019t necessarily colored entirely by friendship per se. Although the duo isn\u2019t very compatible, there\u2019s some romanticism going on. It\u2019s not easy to notice in this series because the two main characters contrasts too much from each other. Because Kagari is often the one saving Takamiya, it\u2019s also easy to notice that she is the senior of their relationship. Not only that but she holds authority at school and has a commanding presence. The good news is that the show doesn\u2019t depict them as a master/slave relationship. The bad news is that their relationship lacks connection. It doesn\u2019t characterizes itself as anything as sui generis. It\u2019s quite obvious to see how much Kagari dedicates herself to protect Takamiya beyond her line of duty. Whether her attraction towards the young boy is romantic or not remains anonymous because they don\u2019t connect in a way a normal couple should be. Furthermore, the series falls with the classic imouto, or otherwise \u2018little sister\u2019 trope involving Takamiya\u2019s sister. It won\u2019t take long for you to figure out that she holds some peculiar affections towards her brother. While it doesn\u2019t necessarily go into an incestuous route, Takamiya\u2019s sister resorts to violence to get what she wants. It defiles what an average family relationship should be while lengthening the gap between the siblings. \\n\\n\r\nMagic is prominent theme in the show because it defines the essence that the witches use throughout each episode. There\u2019s no official class or order that gives ranks to any of the witches. Some of the witches are categorized by types. Yet most often, Kagari just takes the stage and presents the testament of her powers. This brings a problem involving the other witches with their characterization. Only a few of them gets moments to shine with back stories with the most obvious being Kagari. That aside, the action the witches perform throughout the show does offer some memorable moments. Spells are thrown in the air with passion and often envelops a fight with its mystical aura. The fantasy element is credible with the bizarre bunny knights, transformations, and even artistic bomb explosives. The premise also takes itself seriously with actual magical content and emphasis on Takamiya\u2019s development in magical arts. Finally, Kagari can pull out some terrific performances from her hat thanks to her talent.\\n\\n\r\nTaken for granted, Witch Craft Works has the artistic style of a generic series. Takamiya looks normal, perhaps too normal to be defined as a distinctive character. There\u2019s literally nothing that stands out about him in physical characteristics. Kagari is the one that stands out the most with her witches hat, outfit, and attitude. Thankfully, the witches can also be distinctive judged by their physical standards. Most of them are decorated with flamboyant outfits that actually make them look like witches. Even the creatures they summon can be fun to get used to by their nature. J.C. Staff handles the series\u2019 production and plays out its theme correctly. However, there are some moments where the artistic style can be unfitting. In particular, there are usage of computer generated graphics during flight scenes of the backgrounds (i.e. buildings, cars, etc). \\n\\n\r\nMusic and soundtrack is noticeable throughout the series. There\u2019s a magical tone of its OST during scenes when mechanics of witchcraft is explained, most noticeably by Kagari. Soundtrack during action scenes is also consistent on most parts. Spells are also chanted that offers credibility of its themes with words that seems fitting. However, Takamiya once again becomes a problem that holds the characters\u2019 cast back. His voice stands out as dull and annoying. His role throughout the series makes it hard to endure for his lazy attitude and distressing responses. Otherwise, music plays the more fun element of this show in particular with its comedic ED song. It transforms the idea of torture into a parody based on its sensational lyrics. The OST also has a mystical aura behind its tone that may draw you in to the show.\\n\\n\r\nAn attempt to enjoy Witch Craft Works will be difficult if you dislike the main male protagonist, Takamiya. Even many characters in the series dislikes him for his normalcy and dullness. Also, expect the expected as most of the story will feel like a predictable trifle of what you may be used to for its generics. Do not expect major plot twists or deep characterization. Rather, just take for what is granted \u2013 a magical story between a normal boy and an abnormal with. Emphasis on the abnormal. \\n",

Which? tou to koubou \r\nmajo to majo de kongara gacchau kamo ne \r\ntattaka tattaka okose Fancy Crisis! \r\nnijuuyojikan docchi mo kocchi mo Witch! Witch! \r\nBueno, this anime has just ended, so how do I find it, well, I just gonna present my ratings without anymore BS, so, here are my ratings for each of this anime's category:\r\nGood 7: Story and Sound.\r\nStory:  I gave the story such rating co'z at one point I admire the girl protecting guy from harm kind of thing, I guess this is one anime where the girls havethe balls while the guys.......or guy were in skirts, however unlike other animes with such theme, this one has the girl falling in love with the guy and not treating him like shit and the girl itself wasn't treated like a nuisance. However, it's plot, thought it was suppose to be something that was exaggerated was turned into like rocket science where one could find it difficult as to the circumstances as to how the girl was linked to the boy and how the contract thingy works with the girl's madre who has the task of protecting the city. Also, there are a lot of conflicting situation as to distinguishing the difference between the antagonist and the protagonist even though this anime was meant to focus on the relationship between the girl and the boy. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Ok, for the most part, I kinda like most of the voice actors who portrayed the character's in this anime, but the one who did Chronoire's voice, well I think it doesn't fit her given that in this anime she is a hundred something years old witch, where in my opinion she should have been given a more matured voice. Also, I don't like the opening song, but I do like the closing, WITCH, WITCH.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDecent 4: \\n\\n\r\nArt: For the most part, everything was just too fancy, except the school uniform that them girls were wearing since I like its simplicity, but I got to hand it, this anime has no fanservice for the doggies to how about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8:\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Here, I admire Kagari for being this head strong girl who'd be willing to go to any extent to keep Honoka from harm, I also like the way that she acts as a mother figure to the guy, despite of the fact that she is suppose to be the guy's love interest.\\n\\n\r\nHonoka on one hand.......hummm, I do find him annoying at times, but I like the part that he has such integrity of not wanting to depend on Kagari and would rather see her safe that having to go to such effort of protecting him.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Ivory Quintet, well they do provide the comedy aspect of this anime and so as the guy's sister.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFair 6:\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was enjoyable, but understanding as to what is what and who is who about this anime makes look like rocket science even though this anime's genre was romance, magic, supernatural and action.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It wasn't that bad, however, as to how's and what's in this anime basically lacks a more simplistic explanations, but still it's ok to such extent and I'm not saying anything anymore. Adios chicos y chicas.   \\n\\n",

            "content": "I could not wait to write a review for this garbage can.  I will eviscerate this pile of crap and hopefully you will avoid at all costs.  Unless of course you're a masochist.\r\nI'll get to the point.  The main character is one of the most pathetic, sniveling, whiny, weak, pieces of crap i have bore witness to.  Not once does he man up, and the only time he does something actually somewhat noble, he's crying throughout.  For example, one character is dying, all he has to do is kiss the character to ressurect the character.  He decided to sniveland cry and whine for about 5 minutes.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's a point at which the pathetic-ness of a character reaches a point that you stop caring, usually i would have turned it off except I felt a payoff was due, i sat through over half of it, i was going to see it through, so why didn't i turn it off.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a certain plot device in anime, movies, tv, that is meant to build the suspense and anxiety, this particular device makes me rage.  In WCW, it reached such an absurd point that my soul actually left my body.  Imagine having super powers, there is an evil villian that comes to your town, destroys everything, tortures your friends, and then kills everyone.  You would think that if you had a slight advantage you would take it and dispose of this person.\\n\\n\r\nIn WCW, the villains come into town, devise evil, the main characters beat them up a little bit and then walk away leaving the villains half beat up.  Ofc they are villains, so naturally they go away and come back.  At what point should you expect the main characters to at least tie them up?  Nothing breaks immersion or even suspension of disbelief more than something so absurdly unbelieveable as letting the villains go.  I understand you might not want to kill them, i mean, they only killed everyone in town and destroyed everything.  Let them go.  The last episode of the trash bag, this probably happened about 10 times. In a row.  To the point where they would beat the villain up, turn around and start chatting to each other, and then the villain would get up right behind their backs and attack them again.  and everytime they did this, the attacks got more and more heinous until the villain actually killed both of them.  Oh, if it wasn't for love the heroes wouldn't have ressurected.  alas.\\n\\n\r\nSo after the villain literally stabs the main character in the back, she regrets what she's done so she uses magic to heal the mc a little bit and then walks right out in front of like 20 of their friends.  And she just walks away and they have no intention of doing anything to her.  Their jails in this show get broken out of by everyone who gets put in them.  Literally, everyone that ever gets put in jail in this show breaks out immediately.  Seriously what is the point?  The villains basically shit all over everyone and they love it.  I mean this is an anime for extreme masochists.  Japan is doing a great job teaching this shit to people.\\n\\n\r\nHow am i supposed to feel about this?  The protagonists were terrible to watch, the most uninteresting piles of crap i've ever seen.  The \"villains\" were the only redeeming factor in this entire show.  AND NOBODY WON ANYTHING.  Nothing was resolved, none of it even made any sense.  All of it was avoidable.  Every single plan that the evil doers plotted was obviously preventable.  The show didn't hide it, they wanted you to know that.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat was the story here?  MC has power, everyone tries to protect that power, everyone fails miserably, and then nothing happens.  I don't think i've ever felt this enraged after a show before.  I hope you didn't read all of this, but if you did, the moral to this story is stay away unless you can enjoy the fake, lazy suspense that the MC's create by doing virtually nothing and acting so naive and unreasonable that you have to suspect this entire show was written ad hoc on the back of a bar coaster.\\n\\n\r\nGood night.",

            "content": "This is a show which I thought would kind of separate from other mediocre shows with bland characters, bland plot, and uninspired animation. I was kind of right in watching this show.\r\nLet me first start out with the plot.\r\nThe story is not too bad. really. It's not, but it's not a gem either. To summarize... Some bountiful white bitch who refers to him as \"himesama\" or \"princess\" must protect him from this group of witches.. who have animal ears.. and stuff. That is pretty much the only distinction between them and the friendly witch group who is supposed to protect the main character.\r\nstuff happens, maincharacters gets attacked, and the hime to the himesama saves the day once again. Woopdeedoo! Why should I care? Once again, we are not informed of this strong power inside of this main character person the evil witches are after until the last episode. It doesn't even enlighten you as to why there are two separate witch factions and why animal-ears faction is targeting the city. Which leaves you wondering \"what the fuck is going on right now?\" half way through the show. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, just something I'd like to note: Does this anime realize how many buildings were crushed or blown up throughout this series? Enough to warrant a declaration of a terrorist attack. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to grade art and animation seperately then I'd give art a 9 out of 10. The animation however.. is pretty inconsistent to be frank. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is really good.. in some instances anyway. One scene that comes to mind is at some point in the very first episode. You get to see Kagari (the hime to the himesama or just that one heroine in the show) do some Cuuuurraaaazy spins and flame wheel attacks with her broom. It was really nice, I liked it. It gave me hope for the show. But as the show went on, I noticed how lazy J.C. Staff was being. (JCS also did K-Project or K for short) K is a pretty good anime. Not gonna lie but god damn did they mess up the fight animations. They did these pregenerated attack sequences with some of the main characters and it just didn't look well at all and not to mention the still frames... Well, I can strongly say that WCW was a step up from that but it definitely varies. \\n\\n\r\nThe monster (Giant rabbits and bears) animation looks GREAT I must say. I found myself really enjoying king kong one-on-one battles between two giant monsters (and its CG btw). It was very fluent and hilarious at times to see these wonderful scenes. However even though they did better with (some of) their fight scenes, the witch battles still varied from great to slightly average to still frames which I guess you could chock of to bad budget. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest offender of this that I can think of would have to be the second to last episode (without spoiling anything). There is a scene where heroine girl is fighting with the evil villain person-witch gal and it just goes into this 3rd person perspective of heroine gal for no goddly reason and basically she is just dodging all these explosions. It comes off as choppy and amateurish.\\n\\n\r\nSo to summarize, in some aspects as impressed with JCS's improvements and in others I was pretty disappointed with their slip-ups.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nPretty nice, however there is dat ED... There were so many times I would force myself to watch this brain tumor of a song. Words can not describe how much I despise it (not that's bad.. but good lord is it bad).\\n\r\n I'm not much of a musicoholic so can't say much else here. Hi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nMain character was kind of annoying, heroine was okay. All the sub characters are pretty dumb but some of them are quite interesting (Some). oh, and theres the yandere sister... Yahh. Also did not see any character development, the MC was a wuss through and through to the end. And the heroine was still just an overpowered silent hoe.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nDespite some flaws in budget, story and character development it was still pretty enjoyable but nothing I'd encourage for others to watch. But if you want to try it out, then go ahead. You won't be dissapointed but not so much awwed either.\\n\\n\r\nIf you found my review helpful (or not) then leave a like or whatever you do on this site and also leave me feedback so I can know what not to do or do in reviews in the future (I am not a writer for god's sake!) :)",

            "content": "Witch Craft Works is honestly a hard anime to review in my opinion. It contains a lot of cliches, standard anime stock characters, and has moments when 3D CGI is used to help stretch the animation budget. The 12 episodes cover a good bit of story but when the ride is over it feels a bit overwhelming as a whole, yet I highly enjoyed WCW. Is it because I expected this to be another run of the mill harem anime and turned out to be a quirky fantasy romance? That I can't truly say.\r\nWhat I can say about WCW is this: it's fun. While amajority of characters are the usual recycled stock characters, they have enough spice to them to keep them all interesting and they all work extremely well together which is something that a few too many anime fails to work out. The animation excluding the meh CGI moments is incredibly good and one of my personal favorite touches for the anime was how colorful it was just to look at, but a good anime has to have more than a pretty face right?\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned that the story feels a bit underwhelming, after all while most loose ends are explained they are so quickly brushed aside and conflicts end up so easily resolved it often feels like everything leading up to it was just for flashy show rather than story substance. However at the same time it almost works to its advantage where in its 12 episode run it doesn't feel like there are any leftovers that would beckon for a second season. Setting out on what it wants to do and finishing by the final time the ED rings out is something a lot of one cour anime have trouble with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have to say personally this was the surprise of the winter season for me. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did and found myself really loving all the characters in it and having a few good laughs along the way. WCW may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something familiar but different at the same time I would highly recommend WCW.",

            "content": "Witch Craft Works (WCW) was something of a dark horse for me. I was neither expecting to watch it, or even think that I would enjoy it once I actually started. Time, as it seems, has proven me wrong in both regards.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story to WCW is simple and not very complex, and is by no means the strong suit to this magic-endowed action/comedy. However, it is paced well enough, and crafted well enough to get you drawn in to what might happen next. \r\nArt: 8\r\nThe artistic part to WCW is easily one of the noticeably better parts to this anime, with well-designed backgrounds, characterdesigns, effects and 3D animated inserts that don't look like a kitten thrown in a lion's den. Most of the backgrounds are strikingly beautiful, while others are rather plain, but all of the art fits well and has a great color palate. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound design, music and voice acting is another good point to this show. WCW puts its interesting OST to good use, and manages to accompany its scenes well without standing out too much. The voice acting I think could use some work with some of the minor characters, but overall the cast did a good performance, fitting in with the style of their characters fairly well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow to the characters. I really like the centric characters to this story, and while a few of them might not be very unique, I find them endearing. Expect for one, that is. My main beef with this show's character lists is how they handled the main character. For the most part, Takamiya felt like he was just a tool to advance the story, and there weren't very many times were I felt like he was actually doing something, which is rather disappointing considering he is the 'main' character. Alternatively, Kagari was a very good character. Serious to the point of being funny, she represents, in my mind, the core feeling of WCW and why I found it so enjoyable. Another favorite character of mine is Weekend, who is a good example of a weak-but-dangerous villain.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall & Enjoyment: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are many elements that WCW does plenty well: Art, Sound and Characters are done better than the rest, if I say so myself. Fantastic backdrops and some good-quality artworks accents the odd and not very serious tone that the story creates, with sound adding on to the oddity that is Witch Craft Works. Overall, I found it to be a surprisingly enjoyable show. Serious humor (one of my favorite kinds) and the enjoyable ridiculousness of this show is something that I definitely ask of you to try.",

For one i believe a lot of clich\u00e9 situation were used on this serie as a method of comedy relief. Don`t get me wrong i really enjoyed the occasional joke and i laughed at this serie plenty of times myself, however i believe some of them were a little to obvious.\r\nThe plot of this serie however I loved. I like how it was thetypical story (guy appears normal but has a secret power) but with a twist,putting focus not only to the main character but the situation around him, the witches.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art in this serie was pretty good, simple but efficient not to mention that there were plenty of bright colours,well flowing action scenes and sceneries that were very enticing. I believe it lived up well to the standard of modern anime.\\n\\n\r\nsound:\\n\r\nI love the opening to this serie, its fun, catchy and i think it matches the theme of this anime serie perfectly. The ending was just as good and i love how each witch sang their own part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI find it really hard to judge the characters to this serie because on one side they are quite typical but at the same time their not. I feel like although quite a few clich\u00e9s were used i do believe they were used with a twist, a way to make they slightly different from the rest. for example Kagari Ayaka I loved her SO much i thought she was funny and unpredictable, however in the end she just plays the emotionless character... but when it comes to takamiya kun her persona took an unexpected turn that made her so memorable.\\n\r\nI do believe Takamiya kun could have had more of a background considering he was suppose to be the main character.... in the end i think i actually found him the least memorable.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this serie and i really hope there will be a season 2\\n\\n\r\noverall:\\n\r\nits funny, has a good plot and i would definitely recommend it",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT* All I have to say is, so someone's life is on the line, and you can't kiss them on the lips, until you are married??? what is he, 5 years old?? Why does every anime hold kisses on such a grand level like they are about to get married? Most of the show was good but the last episode really annoyed me. Someone that you have feelings for died for you, and they add kind of a comedic part, of him joking around about how embarrassing it is to kiss someone. I guess i might understand a little if he was too embarrassedto do it in a normal situation but for him to think like that when someone is about to die is absurd.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that part, i think the story was good. There are many animes that are so similar that you couldn't tell them apart if they had the same name, but there very few anime that use the \"older girl\" type feeling. Also the story, and the direction  it went was a little different from most as well. Many might complain that no one died, but this is a lighthearted type story, and it would make the story too dark if someone really did die. Even the villains on the show did not give off such  a dark vibe.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could add something to the show, i wish the show could have been longer, and it would have been kind of cool to see the MC learning how to fight on his own. At first i thought that was going to happen when he asked her to train him, but in the end she was too protective of him to train him other than teaching him how to run away if something went wrong.\\n\\n\r\nIf someone asked me if they should watch the show, i would say it depends on what they are looking for. If they are looking for a full on romance, or a combat type show, i would not recommend it because in the end they never really are together. But if you like a lighthearted romance that never tells the watcher that they like each other but the watcher understands by watching it, it is a perfect show to watch. This is the type of shows i look forward to every seasons while waiting for the 9 or 10 rating anime to finish.",

The characters mesh together very well, and there wasn't that traditional relationship that usually exists between the lead male and female characters within the plot. The animation was pretty superb. Overall, this series was very enjoyable and I hope to see a season 2!

            "content": "The character design and fight scenes alone make Witch Craft Works worth watching, but if you're expecting any sort of original or gripping story, you're going to be disappointed.\r\nThe worldbuilding is your generic Magic-Land-With-No-Apparent-Consistent-Logic-Behind-Magic-Use-And-Abilities, which *definitely* weakens the story. The series also relies a little too much on the whole, \"we're going to hide things about everyone's past to make stuff seem mysterious and dramatic\" to create suspense, instead of doing it with good storytelling. \r\nThat being said, the character designs in this series are awesome. Nearly every character (except for the two MCs, really) are imaginative and fun, which brings a lot to theenjoyment factor of the series. The animated fights are also done very well -- I actually kinda liked the use of CGI in Witch Craft Works. The music and sound are also great.\\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun with the earlier episodes in the series, but when it started to get a bit more 'serious' toward the end there, I found myself getting bored. The shift away from character-based episodes and toward plot-based episodes definitely highlighted the weakness of show. I pretty much made myself finish the final two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: if you're looking for a solid plot with some interesting twists, keep walking. If you want to have some fun with cool characters, magic/explosions, and decent fight scenes, sit for a spell and give Witch Craft Works a shot.",

            "content": "It`s somewhat rare nowadays that I stumble across an anime that isn`t based on some sort of manga, visual novel, video game, book, etc. Most anime of the late years have taken up this trend of creating an animation for ideas and plots that already exist.\r\nThis is not to say that anything`s wrong with that. Anime, of course, is another way to create a larger fanbase of the original thing or idea the anime was created upon. Some anime are created which crash and burn compared to the original product, while others soar above the sales of what was originally being advertised. There are someanime, or some gems, rather, which are looked over quite quickly, and never become as popular as they should. While these specific gems aren`t perfect, they aren`t incredibly terrible either. Not every gem is the shiniest or prettiest gem out there, but maybe, just maybe, it does have that extra sparkle or gleam which makes it so much better once investigated upon further.\\n\\n\r\nWitch Craft Works is one of these gems.\\n\\n\r\n~\\n\\n\r\nWitch Craft Works is about a high school student by the name of Honoka Takamiya, a rather regular character who is just passing by his life as quickly and as slowly as everyone else. The most popular girl in school, with great grades, great athletic ability, and great body, that goes by the name of Ayaka Kagari, is always by or near him, causing him discomfort as her raging fans constantly poke or prod at him, annoying Takamiya to no end. One day, Takamiya becomes the victim of a witch looking to steal his power, and she attacks him with her army of mechanical bunnies. Takamiya nearly succumbs to his death as a school building plummets towards him, but he saved by none other than the Fire Witch, and his pretty classmate, Ayaka Kagari. Takamiya acts as the `damsel in distress`, while Kagari is his `knight in shining armor`. The show is based around Kagari protecting her `princess`, as she calls Takamiya, and fighting other witches that are trying to steal Takamiya`s immense power within him. Together, Kagari is unstoppable because of Takamiya.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is pretty original and enjoyable as it unfolds. While there are quite a few plot-holes plaguing the anime, and ideas which are never expanded upon, the regular high school setting with fantastical witches is pretty impressive. It`s not a show that you`ll get serious or dark themes from. It`s carefree, funny, and bright, and stays that way, even when the show gets a bit more intense. The anime usually sets itself up for complex and extensive concepts about the story, but it never takes the chance to grasp upon them. Witch Craft Works is usually much too busy focusing on other things within the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of things it focuses on, Witch Craft Works takes pride in its own animation. The show is absolutely gorgeous, whether it be during fight scenes, regular slice-of-life events, or comedic clips, this anime knows how to begin, transition, and end with its animation. The drawings and settings are completely breath-taking, and the designs for almost all of the characters are charmingly over-the-top and fitting with the story itself. Everything is a plethora of color, while not being too annoying or in your face about the color scheme. It`s bright and happy, and the art will most definitely not leave you disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nWitch Craft Works also takes special consideration in its soundtrack. The music fits very well with the anime itself, but there are only a few which particularly stand alone, and could be listened to on any given day while not watching the show. I thoroughly enjoyed the opening, in both the animation and the singing, but my favorite was the ending. The ED is so catchy and happy-go-lucky, nestling itself in with the mood of the show almost spot-on. I can almost guarantee that it will be stuck in your head for quite some time.\\n\\n\r\nWhile both the animation and sound are superb, the characters are a little worse for wear. While I really adore the gender role reversal of the `princess and her knight`, the trope is what`s really focused on in comparison to the characters. Takamiya is comparatively bland, as most damsels are, and his backstory isn`t actually worked on throughout the course of the anime. Kagari is at somewhat of the same downfall, considering she is just like the quiet and stoic type of character, showing her badassery quite often, but never revealing more than that. Sure, her past is looked upon, but it mostly has to do with Takamiya, and nothing else. I love the dynamic between the two mains, but while the rest of the characters look really cool, there`s nothing special or superb about them.\\n\\n\r\n~\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I really had to think about whether or not to give this anime a seven or an eight. Personally, I`m a bit biased on gender roles reversed, considering I absolutely love when they are performed and done correctly. Sure, Witch Craft Works did a pretty good job on it, but I know some people aren`t as happy with that sort of dynamic focus in the anime. If I were to compare this show to something, it would be like...... It was mostly like a shonen anime, but with all of the genders switched around. And no. Damn. Harem. (For the most part)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while I loved every second of this happy, funny, optimistic show, the story just wasn\u2019t all there. At the end of the day, it was just another anime with great potential that was never expanded upon. Sure, I loved it, but it`s not the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen. If I were to recommend it, which I`m going to, I would say that it`s sort of like a `let`s take a break` anime. Something to watch in between intense anime or really lengthy anime. While I liked it, the only thing I can hope for is a second season, and character development.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7.5/10",

            "content": "I first encountered Witch Craft a few years back on a certain manga site. To my delight, last year it had an animation. It\u2019s been my principle to NOT watch on-going shows, so I\u2019m always late on what\u2019s happening. You see, I just don\u2019t like being left with cliff hangers. Anyway, let\u2019s get on with my ever-so-late review.\r\nStory: 7\r\nWith all honesty, I find Witch Craft\u2019s plot very similar with a lot of seinen series out there. And when I mean similar, It\u2019s your average hi-I\u2019m-the-protagonist-who\u2019s-a-normal-student-who-gets-joined-up-with-a-pretty-complicated-situation. Don\u2019t get me wrong, though! It is not a bad thing. I mean, there are no two exact same thingsin this world, except zubats and dugtrios in a cave. Kidding aside, like I\u2019ve said before, Witch Craft\u2019s plot isn\u2019t that unique.\\n\r\nThe show is about witches, (thanks, Captain Obvious!) and Takamiya Honoka our princess\u2014I mean our male MC. Takamiya is your regular high-school student who happens to sit and rides the same bus every single day with the most popular girl in his school Kagari Ayaka. One day, he takes out the trash from their room and disaster strikes our MC! Oh, don\u2019t worry; it\u2019s just a minor problem. It\u2019s just a part of the school building\u2026 That\u2019ll fall on his head. Of course, we wouldn\u2019t want to end the show with just one episode and let Takamiya die. By unknown reasons, he was saved by Kagari Ayaka. And everything about his normal life will turn around because of this event. What will happen to Takamiya\u2019s everyday regular life? Find out and watch it yourself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nLike I\u2019ve said with all my previous reviews, we will rarely see unpleasant art these modern days. Back with Witch Craft\u2019s; its art is nothing short of magnificent. Every bit is detailed, from the characters to the cute penguins, cats, rabbits, bears, snakes, which constantly appear background. Witch Craft\u2019s art is respectable, period.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nSound or music is a vital part of how good a series can be, too. From the special sound effects to the opening themes and closing themes, everything can be added up to judge how a series would turn to. As for Witch Craft\u2019s, it\u2019s sound effects during fight scenes were fine. What draws my attention was the ending theme done by the antagonist-esque five-women-group made titled, \u201cWitch Activity\u201d. Its upbeat tune made me gaga, and dance like a retard. Forget I said that. Anyway, the OP\u2019s not that bad, either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI like the way the characters turned out in the animation. When I first read the manga I thought that Kagari Ayaka was a guy. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t even think she was a she if not for her big \u201cplots\u201d. Back to the animation, everyone had a stable role in the show; distinctive personality to match themselves and flawless picking of Seiyuu to voice them. The development of the characters weren\u2019t that bad at all.\\n\r\nIt seems like Takamiya has a knack for being unconscious every episode and when he wakes up, he shouts Kagari-san almost always. It\u2019s not that bad, though, considering it\u2019s a light seinen (more like a shounen for me) series from the start and he seems like to possess every being and characteristic of an idjet MC. \\n\r\nThe blending from both the female MC and male MC is good, too. Although, I think they\u2019ve been switched. With the entire cool-beauty aura surrounding Kagari and the feminine side of Takamiya who loves penguins. They complement each other well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed Witch Craft Works a bit more than I should. It\u2019s definitely one of the better shows I\u2019ve seen so far. Everyone has a genre they prefer to watch. As for me, I am a fan of these kinds of show, so you can say I\u2019m a bit biased here. I don\u2019t want to sound overacting on how I liked the show and making your expectation of it high, so I\u2019ll stop here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nOverall, Witch Craft Works\u2019 is not a superb show. But I\u2019m not gonna deny its entertainment value. It was able to amuse me. And the other thing I liked about it was the light-hearted theme it possesses, unlike other dark-themed seinen shows out there. Tbh, I think it should be changed into a shounen rather than seinen. There are a lot of questions in need of answers, so I\u2019m expecting a season two or some sort of sequel to it. All in all, Witch Craft Works is not a bad show. It won\u2019t blow you off like other big-time series out there, but it\u2019ll definitely pique your interest.\\n",

            "content": "The art style of the anime is... rather silly. Like seriously, who creates giant pink teddybears with a summoning spell?!\r\nAnyways the story and the characters are amazing! This anime is exactly what happens when you have a standard shonen/sword&sorcery anime, where you swap genders. To top it off, the boy who always needs the saving is even called Princess!\r\nIt gets very funny and the fights are not bad either. I like how they are deliberately making fun of the \"enemy\" witches. Remember Team Rocket from Pokemon? Kinda like that. Other than that, the anime should likes to make fun of out little \"princess\". In yourtypical \"damsel in distress\" story this time the boy is the one who needs the saving all the time.\\n\\n\r\nKagura, the other main character, is your hero from your shonen manga, but yet again, gender-bent. She's strong, decisive and on-the-point. However, she does show her feminine side, often unexpectedly, which is also one of the things the anime relies on when making jokes. E.g. how she likes to pamper her boyfriends, or wear his shirt (which is super small on her because of her breasts by the way).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also have a normal high-school life though (bet you didn't expect that!). Kagura is the perfect example every girl should strive to be like on high school. The boy however is basically a nobody, a peasant. When he gets together with Kagura, everyone starts hating him, because \"it's not his place\".",

            "content": "For an anime that has a lot of characters for a one season series, the focus is quite firmly on Takamiya Honoka (one of only two males in the series, not that I'm complaining) and Kagari Ayaka, the main characters and practically the heroes of the series, the good guys you're supposed to root for. The story, full of mystery and the unknown at first, progressed nicely for the first 8 episodes, then I lost track of who wanted what and had to ask my younger brother for clarification, which was a bit humbling. The series didn't have much variety to the humorit brought to the episodes, but Kuraishi Tanpopo's karaoke was a blast to watch. The voice actress of Kuraishi, well chosen for her part, gave a sidesplitting performance. It was a scene that I watched again and again, and bolstered the ratings of Witch Craft Works.\\n\\n\r\n  The artwork, and often the computer graphics integrated in the drawing cells was perhaps, maybe, arguably the best I've ever seen in the 30 years I've been watching anime. Of course, anime from the 80's and 90's can't hold a candle to the extravagant and lush and imaginative and fanciful, breathtaking visuals that anime studios bring us these days. The genre of this series must be fantasy. It surpasses even Paprika in terms of trippiness. I say that with a firm assertion. The lowest scores of Witch Craft come in the story and character departments. The big reveal of all this hustle bustle is that not only EVERYTHING comes back to what it was at the start, but EVERYONE also. That is, there's no ending, happy or sad. There's no development from the characters. Ayaka never had much in terms of personality. Her schtick is to be icy, detached, cold but blindly devoted to Takamiya for reasons that are hinted at to tease us, but never revealed. She's the one who stays the most normal during these episodic escapades, and frankly it suits her. It's Honoka that fails lamentably in growing, growing up, evolving any sort of emotion beyond hopelessness and mild stress and confusion. He never grows into the role he has been entrusted. Having frozen everybody's interactions and interface, the story makes everything go back to normal. THAT was hard to take. It was a case of Simpsonland.\\n\\n\r\n  The type of magic used in Witch Craft is about bond and bartering. The bomb girl, Evermilion, a very annoying villain, seemed overpowered and her constant victories seem to undermine the invincible Ayaka. She even took out, seemingly, even Ayaka's powerful mother, who has been subtly and indirectly hyped up as the most powerful witch in that town.The type of magic used, is quite convenient, too much, and servile to the caprice of the story and is subject to the vagaries of the plot. Yet, the visuals are still at the service of the story, unlike most non anime and live action series I've seen. There has been quite some imagination spent into fleshing out this world. The worlds in between, the alternate dimensions are all memorable and intricate. There have been quite a few anime (cough, K, cough), that have put all their onus on the artwork and failed in all other respects. Witch Craft Works is an arresting series with a lot of heart, and I appreciated it very much, proof of which is reflected in my scores and this review. I definitely recommend it and will remember watching it for a long time.",

            "content": "\"Witch Craft Works\" manages to take a few cliches/average plots (weak main male characters surrounded by strong women, some harem, good and evil fighting for the main character because they have immense power they have no idea about, etc) and not completely beat them to death. In fact, they played around with their boundaries, breathed new life into them and all the while told a pretty good story along the way.\r\nHowever, I truly think this show could have benefited from a few more episodes to allow for more development and storytelling, but I think it did well for the small period it had to covereverything. Very little was left unexplained but the full background to Kagari and Takimaya's relationship was cut short and never finished which is rather disappointing. But I also have to commend them for not basing this on the obvious romance that could have erupted between the two main characters, but rather the bond/contract they share and how they have to grow with one another rather than simply being together.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nAs I said before, there's a few cliches, but overall it's enjoyable. It can feel rushed because they want to get all the big points put into 12 episodes, but if you can look past that little detail then watching this series is a breeze.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nAll the art seemed so average to me. Nothing too special, but not particularly bad either. Even my mom commented on the graphics being \"lame\" when she saw what I was watching. And that's all there is to it - the graphic didn't wow me or dazzle me and were just... there. Evermillion, Kagari in full-fledged Fire Witch form and the intricacy of the development of the tattoos on Kagari/Takimaya that would form are the only things that were moderately stunning.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nIt was good, well placed and never overpowering.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThere could have been a little more development in this area. The fact that the tower witches motives were purposefully left so vague worked out at first, but I think individual characters should have made their motives known. I mean, if all of these witches knew about Takimaya then why are they finally attacking now? This is also a failed plot point. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, I do like how they made it seem like Kagari was carefree (which mostly came off as lack of emotion), but would periodically reveal something that showed otherwise through flashbacks and small breaks. Also Kagari and Takimaya are phenomenal foils of each other that meet on certain levels; her lack of emotion is countered by his deep caring and emotional desires to keep everyone safe and their recklessness, for various reasons, show their similarities. \\n\\n\r\nEach witch from their respective side managed to have their own distinct personality and most showed why they were on their particular side.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment of the series is definitely high. At times, the show was extremely cute and at others it kept me engaged in the fights as I wondered how Kagari could do all she did and walk out just fine. And really, the characters were all pretty likable in their own right. \\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this anime. I don't think it's for everyone (but there's not a single anime that is, honestly), but I think it's worth taking a chance with.",

Witch Craft Works takes an almost episodic structure and the only thing that ties the show together chronologically is the progression of the characters.\r\nAnd I\u2019m completely okay with that as this show had a large and great cast of characters. The thing that made this show so enjoyable for me was how goofy everyone was. It was very much likeThe Devil is a Part-Timer!Where the characters would normally be taken seriously but instead they are not. Often times these characters feel like actors in a play. Once their scene of fighting is over everyone is friends even living in the same house.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few episodes of plot that take two episodes to resolve but these are few. Any of the drama, action, and suspense this show could have had was removed in lieu of the romance. Which normally I would be alright with, however, that romance had no payoff. If you\u2019re going to remove many of your possible aspects to focus on one thing in particular than whatever you focus on should be damn good. Sadly by the end of Witch Craft Works our wonderful main characters are exactly where they were in the first couple episodes. We just simply understand them better.\\n\\n\r\nI should add this show is getting an OVA in July. When that airs it is possible to change my opinion of the show. However, for now this show is one with high enjoyment but absolutely no payoff, so most of that enjoyment is ruined in the end.",

            "content": "I'm going to keep this review as short as possible. I don't want to make it boring as the anime is. Contains some spoilers and swear words, so if you want to avoid one of these things stop reading it now. One more thing, be aware of that English is not my first language. ;) \r\nStory (4): Pretty casual story. Main male character is a \"container\" who possesses hidden magic powers. Both the Workshop Witches and the Tower Witches want him. The first are trying to catch him, when the other one are trying to protect him. Simple as that. (If you want to knowmore read a synopsis or watch it yourself.) It seems like a plot is not really important and have changed few times during the show. I mean, the anime could be shorter if we cut some useless things like - let's call it side, because I don't have any better word for that - side story where Kagari was about to learn this moron Takamiya some magic. It took them so long to even start. When she was finally attempting to teach him, he got hurt while \"learning\" and she needed to stop. Really? That's it? He was talking some much that he needs to protect her... Blah, blah, blah... And it finished faster than it started.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6): The anime art is alright. I've seen some better and worse visuals. I have almost nothing to say against it, except moments where a 3D animations were used. It creates massive contrast between objects animated with a classic \"drawn\" way and a computer animated objects, destroys immersion and of course looks bad. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8): I'm sure that a sound is the best thing in this anime, especially the ending, which is really catchy. There is nothing more I can argue about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5): Here we go... That is the first anime where the main characters are so annoying. The male mc is a pussy and crybaby, what can I say more. He is just useless. There are two or three episodes, where he actually did something. I hate this type of MC... The female MC, his nanny. Overpowered, emotionless princess. And... That's it. Are you surprised? No need for that. She is not interesting whatsoever. The only good thing about her is some \"comedy\" aspects that happened and of course are related to relationship, between herself and the male MC.  If I would give a score based on these two I would give one point. What saves this anime are supporting characters. They were just lovely. I'm mostly talking about this small group of Tower Witches who used to live in MC's house, but the other were great too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4): Due to that the story doesn't add up and main characters were hard to swallow, it was really hard for me to finish this anime. It took me around month to do this. Which is quite an achievement, because that have never happened to me to watch an 12 episode anime so long.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5): A comedy bits were funny and were making me smile and even sometimes giggle. If you are a person who doesn't care about that the main male MC is a fag*t, you will enjoy this anime.",

The saving grace of this shitty anime, and although main cast of strong girl and her sissy boy that licks her feet before bedtime is somehow refreshing in shonen genre, what really shines are secondary characters, all of which are interesting enough that I wished they'd elaborate somewhat about their background instead of introducing another *bullshit villain that turns into ally* (puke from shonen gibberish overload).\\n\\n\r\noverall it was enjoyable enough that  I didn't regret watching it, but if I were you, pondering whether to give this series a shot, I'd pass it up.

Honestly from the soundtrack to the plot its amazing to watch. It reminds me alot of Trinity Seven with the types of magic they use and the soundtrack. \r\nThe characters in the show are all likable and very fitting in their role, even the main guy who at first seems weak ends up turning into a complete badass in the second half ofthe show.\\n\\n\r\nDon't let the low ratings on here put you off from this show trust me.",

I watched this anime because it was recommended by someone who said it was pretty okay. I had high hopes for this anime since it was a bit different from the usual anime I watch considering that the MC who protects is actually the Girl MC and not the Male MC, but I felt like it was just kinda swapped personalities of a typical male-female duo.\r\nSo that's enough of me rambling, let's get to the review.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\n| It was pretty okay for the anime, I mean it's nothingspecial but it's not bad either, it's pretty much mediocre. The only thing that prevented me from giving this a 5 was because it had some key story points in which they could've expanded more and would've made the whole anime much better and much more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\n| The animation is pretty good actually, I liked the visuals especially during the battle scenes, not much can be said about the animation other than it's pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\n| Like I said about the animation, it's pretty decent for the anime but nothing really special about the soundtracks and music the anime has. Again, nothing can be more said about the sound other than it's okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\n| The anime's Male and Female MC was pretty disappointing. It felt like the MC's just swapped personalities and the writers called it a day. The Male MC seemed like the typical Female love interest who can't really do anything but be eye candy, except it's a guy instead of girl plus the naivety of a Male MC's sense of justice. The Female MC was pretty much the typical Male MC who does all the fighting. To be honest the side characters were much more interesting than the MC's.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\n| The anime is pretty much a light-hearted plus action anime during the first half and tried to make somewhat of a conflict during the second half of the show. I'd say I enjoyed it, but not so much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\n| Overall, the anime is pretty mediocre. I would've liked it much better if they improved the story a bit more and made the characters much more alive.\\n\\n\r\nSo, that's my review for Witch Craft Works. I normally don't make reviews but for some reason I really felt obliged to make one for this anime. \\n\r\nOh, and this is pretty much my first review of an anime.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: Meh.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's been awhile since I watched an anime not having read a review or article about. It has a bevy of diverse characters and an interesting story. The world they live in is well throughout, the action is spectacular and the art is gorgeous. Despite a near all female cast, the show is chaste and modest. I even liked the fact that Honoka Takamiya needs to be rescued by Ayaka Kagari.\r\n  So many anime cliches that irk me. First is Ayaka's character design, which I understand. She's suppose to be the super smart and beautiful idol of their school; so her figure is designedwith giant boobs. But was that really needed? No other aspect of this series was that sexualized. Which brings me to my next issue. Am I the only one tired of the jealous, clingy little sister? Because I am. It's completely wasted here because despite the suggestive situations Kasumi Takamiya catches the two of them in, Honoka isn't that kind of guy. She doesn't know her own brother, who she adores, isn't the type of guy who lusts after girls like that? The bullying aspect was a nice touch. Also scoby syndrome a.k.a. characters who are tantamount to useless. 13 characters: two are our main characters, two are family members, six are antagonists and three are characters who have no bearing on this story. Worth mentioning is the fact the hero duo is so overwhelmingly powerful that I questioned finishing this series after five episodes. No matter what danger they face, you know the heroes will win.Throw in a cute mascot to help sell merchandise and we have a winner. It's not like these things ruin the series, but I mention them as a measuring stick. It's these little things that separate a five star anime from a four star anime.\\n",

            "content": "Its actually oddly difficult writing a review for this anime. Its wacky, funny, the art is well done and I liked the music. However the story and the characters are where this anime gets a little rocky. Now I haven't read the manga or any other adaptation so this is only for the anime.\r\n    The story starts off with the male main character Takamiya, Honoka being beaten up for dropping his eraser and having the school \"princess\" pick it up for him. This is where they introduce roughly the idea that the whole schoolloves the female main character Kagari, Ayaka. We go on to find out that Ayaka is also a witch who protects Honoka from dangers, which now are mainly the evil witches who are after him.\\n\\n\r\n    This is actually kinda interesting to me. Cute girls, funny cheeky combat, and the show doesn't take itself too seriously. The problem with this however is that there is some really interesting back story that never really gets explored and by the end of it that made the score take a big hit. The story starts slow, things happen in almost a slice of life pace. However the pacing picks up towards the middle and they don't take the viewer along. They constantly hint that the story and the answers to fully enjoy the show will be given sometime but it never truly comes. The last two or three episodes of the anime answer some questions however raise just as many as they answer. This wouldn't have been a problem if they kept to their slice of like pacing and story telling but eventually the story turned into a more serious one and the viewer was given no knowledge to propel themselves into the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\n    The characters were actually pretty well done, though the depth that people usually look for in characters isn't really their either. Each character had a part to play in the story and revolved around the male MC. However do to the sporadic story telling of the show we only find out some bits of information about certain characters but overall their isn't any sit down and learn about their past episode which was fine. My biggest issue with the characters was Honoka. He was playing the weak character role and played it well. At first I thought this was going to be more spoofy, as the first time Ayaka saves him she calls him her princess. This however was wrong, he constantly stops the progress of the story to constantly interject his weakness. This becomes repetitive and annoying after awhile.\\n\\n\r\n    The art and sound were actually really well done. I love anime art and honestly I cant put my finger on why. This doesn't strike me like SHAFT does but its very well done. The environment and the characters are all done really well. They use a lot of vibrant colors and add a lot of things that draws attention like floating orbs or ear and teeth that allow for some interesting visuals. The music was catchy and I can see myself adding it to a Youtube playlist.\\n\\n\r\n    Overall this anime was actually pretty entertaining. The reason it gets a six is that I don't think I will ever watch it again. It was hard for me to get past Honoka constantly being super weak. It was also hard to follow the story and I know if I watch it again I will only be left with the same amount of questions. That being said the comedy element was well done and I enjoyed my first watch of this show. Its not something I would recommend but if magic girls and Weak MC's are your thing give it a shot.",

            "content": "Witch Craft Works is a magical fantasy anime that may lack a bit in the area of plot development, it still excels in overall presentation.  The story is about a high school boy, Takamiya, who has his seemingly peaceful high school existence interrupted by Kagari, the schools smart and beautiful \"princess\".  Originally he laments about having to sit next to her in class which makes him both envied and ignored.  Then one day he is attacked by a girl who is a witch and Kagari swoops in to save him revealing that she also is a witch.  This is the beginningof a bizarre story about witches and their fights to retrieve the power that lies hidden within Takamiya.\\n\\n\r\nBizarre fight scenes, outrageous looking characters, and the secret dead pan ways that Kagari shows her love towards Takamiya make this a fun anime to watch.  Throw in a \"bro-con\" little sister witch and you can't ask for much more.  It is true that the overall plot of the story just starts to come around when the anime ends, but that is typical of most animes based on mangas.  The first season is never long enough to answer all the viewers questions about the story and leaves you wondering if they will ever make a second or if this is to get you to go read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this was typical of a  J.C.Staff anime, nothing complicated, just fun.",

            "content": "Witch Craft Works is an incredibly visually appealing anime with great character designs and concepts that aren\u2019t used all that well, and ends up as a kind of boring, sloppy mess that masquerades as your average battle romcom. Nothing is explained very well, but it's kind of charming anyway.\r\nThe role reversal concept (male princess, female knight) was what drew me into this anime, and really, it seems like it should be one of the more interesting concepts, but\u2026 it goes nowhere. The guy is just generally a useless softie who wants to be better, and the girl is your average kuudere school idol- perfect grades,trained in every martial art, perfect at everything except expressing her feelings\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nEverything is pretty. There\u2019s a Senran Kagura-level of creative and memorable design on the characters, and while most of the scenery is typical high school/Japanese city, the few times (2 or 3 that I can remember) they go into magical \u201cwitch\u201d areas, the landscapes are absolutely enthralling and magical, in a pastel, harmless way. (Fair warning: there IS CG in this anime. It\u2019s used very little beyond the beginning arc, but it\u2019s not terribly bad or distracting. I kind of like it.)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, how everything is used\u2026 is not terribly creative. Most of the episodes jump between two conflicts- that of the main guy\u2019s role as the Chosen One, and as a magic user (\u201cmagic plots\u201d), and that of the main couple\u2019s relationship, either in training or daily life (\u201cromcom plots\u201d). The magic plots are usually action-heavy and dramatic, while the romcom plots tend towards slice-of-life banter and very light ecchi. The comedy lands pretty often, for what it\u2019s worth, and the slice of life parts that revolve around the main couple are lighthearted and entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nThe action, though? The magical abilities are actually quite captivating, with each witch using a specific style of magic that suits their design. The problem is that they show their hand far too early. Characters early on display beautiful magic powers that pretty much blow any other effect in this anime out of the water. It removes a lot of the wonder and excitement at reveals later on in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s the main problem- this show\u2019s pacing. It jumps between plots, tones, and intensity far too fast, but with some recognizable patterns. There's always a moment during a slice of life segment where conflict comes in to put it on pause. Or during an action segment, there's some looming cutaway gag from the comic relief that breaks that dramatic tension so carefully created by great villains. (For what it\u2019s worth, all the villains\u2019 designs and fight sequences are excellent. Their motivations? Pretty much non-existent.)\\n\\n\r\n(start rant) It\u2019s not\u2026 bad. I\u2019ve seen a whole lot worse. It pretty much only switches between 2 tones, and the ending arc is pretty serious all the way through. But I much prefer the slice-of-life segments. Framing this as more of a romance or slice of life (in the vein of Oh My Goddess, or hell, Maid Dragon) would\u2019ve been a lot better, and a lot more conducive to the ensemble cast of villains and heroes. Seriously, having like 10 separate good witches and like 5 separate bad witches that are fleshed out nigh-equally is just horrible for a 12-episode anime! The focus is spread equally among every character who isn\u2019t \u201cmain,\u201d and every single one hurts for it. The sister is a bland brocon, the 5-person Team Rocket witch team literally never do anything productive (ignoring a tiny element near the end, that ends up being unnecessary), and the chairwoman\u2026 what, honestly did she do? Dang it, you have some good characters. USE THEM. Don\u2019t use them as bait for flashbacks, don\u2019t waste them in one-off fights or gags, don\u2019t restrict their character to one trait. You did fine with the main couple, why limit yourself? There are great ensemble cast series that actually flesh out a wide array of personalities and ideas. Jitsu wa Watashi wa (manga) is a great example- varying amounts of time were spent on each character to help them fit into the environment and realistically involve themselves in future story arcs. If a character is overall useless, or going to be\u2014 let them be, look, and act one-bit. Don\u2019t fool your viewers into liking or hoping for the spotlight on characters that are just going to be background butt monkeys. (end rant)\\n\\n\r\n6.2/10. Great visuals, great designs, with some good ideas. But it's pretty much all wasted. Bonus points for that catchy ED. And don\u2019t even get me started on the actual story...\\n",
