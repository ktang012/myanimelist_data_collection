Hell, I even thought that this might just be another shitty anime short with shit animation. But I was wrong. After watching the first episode, I enjoyed it very much! For a fan of dirty jokes like me, this series is perfect! \r\nThere's nothing more to discuss on this series. It's just an encyclopedia of dirty jokes. If you are a fan of those things, watch this, definitely watch this! It will definitely fulfill your inner desire. I wouldrecommend this to those who like Seitokai Yakuindomo, both anime are extremely similar in a lot of ways. \\n\\n",

            "content": "To be honest, I was looking forward to My Girlfriend is a Faithful Bitch (Sho-Bitch for short) at the start of the season. From what I could see, it was a bunch of cute girls making fun of the MC by being as lewd as possible. It didn\u2019t sound like anything amazing but it looked fun enough to give a try. I thought I was right with my judgement as the first few episodes were pretty funny and I genuinely enjoyed it. Then it just kept adding more and more characters, each lewder and dumber than the last one, and I slowly started to regretmy decision.\\n\\n\r\nAs I already said, I laughed at first. It didn\u2019t do anything extraordinary with the comedy but it was funny nevertheless. However, the show tried to become more and more extravagant with its lewdness, devolving into forced gags every single episode. At first, it only had the generic MC, an airhead girlfriend who can\u2019t figure out how to act in a relationship, and a childhood friend and little sister who were too close for comfort. This cast wasn\u2019t much but the jokes they created were just enough to make most chuckle. \\n\\n\r\nThat was until the cast slowly increased its numbers, which just overloaded the show. Each one would create misunderstanding after misunderstanding which got more and more unbelievable and unrealistic, throwing in an assortment of incest jokes, gay jokes, and public sex jokes. You just can\u2019t laugh at a show where a transfer student says she loves playing with hairy boys, which is what she calls her dogs for whatever reason, or when the most popular kid in school (who also happens to be gay) helps the MC to get better at baseball, which somehow manages to look and sound like him giving him a handjob from afar. \\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, it provides no breathing room as it transitions from scene to scene to show off the next new gag. The lack of a coherent flow just buries you under a mountain of bad comedy, making you want nothing more than to finish the episode already so you can be free of this torture. \\n\\n\r\nSho-Bitch tries way too hard to make the character's every piece of dialogue as dirty as possible that the only thing you can do is sigh in disbelief, unable to understand why these characters are so fucking stupid. After a while, the only time I could laugh was when someone running around went head first into a desk, which I think is a good representation of how much I dislike the cast. In fact, I will go as far as to say that by the time I reached the halfway mark, I hated every single character and would love nothing more to watch the entire school burn to the ground in a fiery blaze.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance isn\u2019t much better. It tries to be really sweet all the time, like the MC thanking his girlfriend for trying to make him lunch, even though it sent someone to the infirmary when they tasted it, or him trying to look cool in front of her by practising hitting a home run in secret. It really would have been sweet if the build-up to the romance wasn\u2019t riddled with the terrible humour mentioned above. When you can\u2019t take the show seriously, everything suffers, and the romance suffered the most.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason would be the actual couple. I said before that I hate all of them, but I was actually fine with Shinozaki and Kousaka (along with a few others) at the beginning. It was somewhat cute watching Kousaka try (fail) to understand Shinozaki's fetish so she can be a better girlfriend, but you soon grow tired of it. She just ends up looking like a massive idiot. Shinozaki ain't any better, as he doesn't have a defining characteristic about him. He's just there to either make a comment after each gag or be added to the evergrowing pile of misunderstandings. His boring personality doesn't stand out at all, making him more uninteresting than a bag of rocks.\\n\\n\r\nIt had a nice start. I\u2019ll give Sho-Bitch that, but what followed shortly after is unforgivable. If I haven\u2019t convinced you to avoid this show, then go for it. Proceed knowing the fact that you\u2019ll probably be in excruciating mental pain as you try to force your way through this disaster disguised as entertainment. I know I said I enjoyed it at first, but giving this show a higher score just would not sit right with me.",

            "content": "There is a real problem when it comes to comedy anime, some of them doesn't fucking know how to maintain its cool without overusing the same joke more than 4 times in a row every 2 or 3 minutes of an episode, this is seen in many anime like \"Sakamoto desu ga?\", \"One Punch Man\"or even \"Aho-Girl\" it gets old pretty fast, and this anime is no different... well, to be honest, it is worse.\r\nTL;DR: Overall Section\r\nThere is no story, the only concept we have is that the MC confessed to a girl he liked and that girl accepts him while they try to dotheir best as a couple. The problem is that the main heroine doesn't know how to act like a human being, instead she confuses everything and transform it into sex jokes. This \"anomaly\" happens a lot, it doesn't stop, it never stops, it just get worse time by time, you can see around 5 jokes in a row every 2 or 4 minutes, is not even funny, it is very disgusting and cringe inducing, there is absolutely NOTHING worth about the story on all the 4 episodes I've seen, and I think it is way too much to call it a day, if the show will maintain the same formula for the rest of the season, I'll rather stop here and warn people from wasting their time. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter hearing that, I don't think that people might be interested at all about the other aspects, but I'll take them in mind if someone ever wants to read it. The animation is your average budget for generic anime, there is nothing really special about it, there might be a character out there that you like for its design,  but I think that's all about it. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, at its best consist on character's VA of girls acting abnormally horny against the main character, it gets annoying pretty fast, the soundtrack doesn't even hit, nothing special on this point. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of this show are the characters, there's only 2 characters out there that I like just because they don't go around with an intense case of sex urgency, sadly for them, they got to meet the stupidest girl around that only thinks about sex, it doesn't matter if it involves underage girls, everything must be a sex joke, and not just that, the freaking childhood friend, and the little sister of the Main Character also has extreme urgency for dicks, I just don't know what the fuck is going on anymore, these characters doesn't even make any sense, not even for an Ecchi, it is just ridiculous. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nHow I expressed myself about the anime just shows how much I were enjoying it, Sadly, MAL doesn't include negative numbers, otherwise the count could have gone lower than -10 as Enjoyment factor. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10: Romance story goes wrong, girls wanting dicks 24/7, lame sex jokes, disturbing sex jokes, cringey sex jokes, nothing really worth it about it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I know that other people might like this show, and well I understand that and that's perfectly fine, this preview is aimed towards those people like me that expected a good romcom, but got nothing in exchange.",

            "content": "Great comedy anime, reminds me of the amazing Seitokai Yakuin Domo.\r\nDon't really understand all these people giving it 1/10. They're either 8 or 80 and don't know how to enjoy a comedy show or were expecting a completely different anime. As if they didn't knew in what they were getting into after reading the synopsys... (Or maybe there just weren't enough lolis? Who knows)\r\nSo, it's a great show for those who enjoy comedy, but if explicit jokes offend you, stay away from this.\r\nWhen it comes to characters, there's the mature ones, and the perverts, which creates many funny scenarios. There's not really any character development,but that's not the point for an anime like this anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent. It's the normal animation used nowadays. Can see that some money went into boobs physics. Nothing different or outstanding like Kujira no Kora or Hai to Gensou no Grimgar.\\n\\n\r\nThe ops and eds are your typical anime music. Nothing that I like too much but combines with the show, and that's what matters.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not really a story, here, just like Blend S or Himouto, things just happen, but here it's in a more funnier way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I enjoyed this so much. It's been a while since an anime made me laugh so much, and that's what anime is about. Enjoyment. You may think you're the best because the underrated boring show is your favorite of the season, while \"plebs\" are loving black clover, shokugeki and this, but that kinda attitude is the reason you have no friends. Like that annoying girl from Youkai Apato.\\n\r\nDon't force yourself into watching an anime. Don't like it? Go away. Enjoying it? Stay\\n\\n\r\nSo that's why I give it an overall 9. I enjoyed this and had a good time. Not the best show. But one worth watching to relax and chill after a hard day or just anytime.",

IT'S NOT YOUR NORMAL ANIME THAT JUMP SEASONS JUST FOR BIKINI AND SHRINE VISITING EVENTS... so many more should be coming if there was next season. \\n\\n\r\nART: two different anime studios collaborated on this series so don't ask for consistency of animation \"I ALSO SEE THE FLAWS BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT THAT MUCH\" for me.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: nothing bad to mention but \"ENDING THEME was TOO CUTE\".\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: every character has their time to shine.

But most of all, how come that he doesn't take advantage of the whole situation. Are you a friggin man or what?\\n\r\nFor the second character. Well, it's like a conglomerate of horny women who apparently gravitate around the MC's dick in an endless fall. \\n\r\nThree, or four, completely identical characters that put you in the very hard position of hating them or just punch the monitor in front of you.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI'll just say that finding the least enjoyment in this show is the most enjoyable part.\\n\r\nIt's been very, very hard to get to the sixth episode, but I tend to give second chances. \\n\r\nNot here, not again\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something arousing, just skip this crap.",

            "content": "You see, there are different kinds of Harems out there. Some I consider to be light, kinda like Grisaia franchise, where despite the main hero being surrounded by girls, the anime itself focuses on the overall story rather than the sexual moments between the characters. While other I consider to be \"extreme\" in a way that the sexual harassment and suggestive jokes play the main role. Also I have to note that meanwhile I don't mind the light harems, I'm not really into the extreme one's, purely because I don't like echiiness as a whole.\r\nAnd now, there is Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch (willuse just Sho-bitch from now on). A show that possibly couldn't be more extreme. Cause the only things the show has to offer are tons of ecchi moments and a huge ammount of ambiguous jokes.\\n\\n\r\nYou may want to ask, why did I even started watching this since I don't like this type of anime. Well, my stupidity comes to play here, because I very rarely read something about shows before watching them, so I really didn't know anything about Sho-bitch coming into it.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, the show offers an experience full of ecchiness and ambiguity. Which in itself isn't a bad thing at all. Yeah, I don't really enjoy it myself, but there is a huge ammount of people who do. And I can actually say that the first two episodes were actually really funny.(Everybody has to laugh at dirty jokes from time to time, right?). \\n\\n\r\nThe main duo, that being Kousaka and Shinozaki, works very well together. Kousaka is a pretty weird girl, with an unexpectedly dirty thoughts. Shinozaki is a boy, who tries to balance her dirtyness by just being a normal human being. They're encounters are funny and their also kinda cute together. Also the craziness of their whole relationship can be called a positive thing.\\n\\n\r\nThis is however, where the whole problem of having a anime based on \"sexual jokes\" starts to shine. And the problem is simply being: You can't base your series solely on those two-way jokes. Yes, they can be funny at times, but they'll stop being funny immediately when you stack every episode with dozens of them. Not just that, but also the fact that the jokes became superly predictable. Seriously, every single joke is pretty much the same. And there is nothing worse than when a comedy anime becomes predictable, because it ultimately loses almost all of it's value.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I have are the other main/side characters. They are just super bland and a pure copies from another harems. You have a little sister, big sister, girl who likes to touch other girls etc. etc., and of course, everyone of them is sexually harassing the main hero. This time around, they don't even have a particular reason to do so. They are just there to provide the fan-service moments, that this show lives from.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is somewhat inconsistent. I really like the look of some characters, yet really dislike some other ones. The animation itself is also quite inconsistent. Which just means that some scenes look better than some others, which in itself is understandable, however it becomes very weird when it happens as much as here. The sound is not bad, but like somebody else stated in their review, the voice-actors seem to be quite limited by the way their character acts and reacts.\\n\\n\r\nSo what do I actually think about Sho-bitch? First and foremost, it's an anime for the fans of harem and ecchi stuff. And while I think the first two episodes were kinda funny, the obscure ammount of dirty jokes really did ruin the number of episodes I can take. Also the fact that the anime just stopped being funny way too quickly.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Dropped after episode 5.",

Overall if you enjoy comedy with a more sexual flare than you will enjoy this anime. \r\nMore In Depth:\r\nSound:\r\nThe soundtrack is alright but not very memorable It's not bad but it's not mind blowing pretty average.\r\nArt And Animation:\r\nThe art aesthetic looks really nice I'm abig fan of the more modern look of ecchi these days, and the animation is pretty decent nothing too bad so far.

This girl is inexperienced but perverted in a way always assuming his fetishes. This is fine for like maybe the first two episodes then it just gets boring and repetitive. It wasn't that funny to start with but now it complete cringe as the same jokes get made every episode but in different ways.\r\nI like the art and love the character designs. It cute and fun. Can't say much more about itthan that.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and voice actors push a cute vibe. You might find it annoying you might not. If you are into moe anime you would probably like it. The voice actors do seem limited by their characters though. they really only have one tone to stick to so it's hard to judge.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fine at the start but get old fast. like I said before it just the same jokes being repeated over and over so the characters get tiresome also. The personalities are special they stick to their roles and nothing else. It's rather boring. They added a new character but nothing much has changed if anything about the vibe this show gives off. If she wasn't added the story would be exactly the same. She is just a gateway to the tired jokes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, watch the first episode then drop it. that first episode is all you are going to be seeing throughout this. It's not a bad anime just boring to watch because there is never anything new.",

            "content": "I once read an review here on MAL on the anime \"School Days\", that said that the only value said anime had was for opening pickle jars or any activity involving \"brute strength\". The reason was that School Days made you so angry that you needed to relieve yourself of the aggression.\r\nWell, this anime doesn't even have that quality. It serves no purpose except waifu material but I can't see how anyone can stand any of these characters or their deranged obsession with innuendo. I'll try to just summarize the three Prime evils of this anime so you don't spend too much time even readinga review of this godawful anime.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the sound. Dramatic Movies often tend to overuse simple piano music for their tender moments, or sometimes the background noise sounds very artificial. The sound team behind this anime have no sense of overuse and decided that Visual Novel background noise was the way to go. You know the saxophone solo from \"Careless Whisper\" by George Michael? Imagen hearing that over and over again with a saxophone being played by a guy with throat cancer. It will drive you insane if you don't gnaw your own legs off.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the animation. It is not the worst animation quality I've seen, but it's up there with the likes of salad fingers. But salad fingers is redeemed. This anime isn't. They have loads of animation errors, routine misuse of the human anatomy that will persist throughout the show. And the background is just as bad as the foreground but in a lazy carefree way. Your eyes are getting tortured by two different technics at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally. The writing. Someone, a human like you and me, wrote the script of this anime and said it was okay. The inhuman use of bad innuendo is remarkable if this show has one thing going for it it's the effort they put in to make every sentence available to innuendo. They have destroyed any hint of a story for the sole purpose to have a couple of sex jokes. \\n\\n\r\nIn Summation. This anime will leave you brain-dead, blind, legless and with no pickles on your sandwich.\\n\\n\r\nNothing against the author of the Review from School Days, it was a great review wich shared some of my views.",

And, after the buildup of a whole month's wait for this new show is spent fantasizing over how cool something named Sho-bitch could possibly be, we find that this anime is merely a light novelty. Clearly, the show's story is going nowhere interesting whatsoever. The characters are just unfathomably easy to HATE. All the female characters act like impure harlots with minds that containsevere psychological trauma. And, the sho-bitch herself is a total freak. There is a wacky, cheesy, disgusting, unfunny booby / weewee joke around every single corner of the show too. The show in and of itself is nothing what I expected from the previews. I thought this would be about a pure romance between two real lovers, not miscellaneous horny freaks running amok. And that's another thing. Sho-bitch seems random for no reason; as if the writers are just lazy. No characters have any depth at all whatsoever so far. The story is without meaning. No particularly memorable or truly interesting dialogue, only greasy interactions between male and female, occasionally female on female. This anime probably only exists for horny 13 year olds to watch to see what their fresh pubescence has in store for them. There is nothing of value for a mature audience here. If you too are mature, looking for some show that's funny and entertaining while running with a romantic aspect to the show, trust me, and do not waste your time watching this garbage. It's completely worthless.",

They could have made it more simpler by just having them wear blue pants both in winter and summer attire without any fancy shimancy crime of fashion, then again when it come with the girls school uniform , well nobody can go wrong with it as long as the skirt is short.\\n\\n\r\nFair 6, Sound:\\n\\n\r\nWell, since I have no comments about who did who, I'm just leaving this blank......\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3, Character:\\n\\n\r\nSo in every aspect we have a guy who's playing this goody in two shoes as he rebukes them girls sexual innuendo and green jokes, and as for the girls like Akiho, Shizuku, Kanata the imouto, Saori, Rina, sayo and gay guy Seiya were just soooo full of it. so, it is so poor poor.\\n\\n\r\nFair 6 , Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nOne silver lining about this anime was the relationship between between Akiho and Haruka, where we see them in a serious relationship, where it somehow, it is doing fine........and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3, Overall: \\n\\n\r\nEverything were just soooo silly......that only a LeFou would rate this higher. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGaston OUT,  PUUUUUTHWEEP  PTUI!!!!!!!!I've spitted again.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "[No spoiler review]\r\nIt's ironic that I just wrote that disclaimer, considering I'm about to tell you that there is nothing to spoil - unless of course you consider what is already a stale and flavourless anime as something worth consuming.\r\nIf you haven't notice by the score and opening line, I didn't enjoy this show, and don't think it's worth your time - which could be better spent proving Obama is white. Initially the anime draws you in with an interesting snippet from a future episode, one that was audacious and just screamed \"This anime is filled with ironic and over the top sexual humour\". Andthen we a greeted with the generic male protag who's just the observer/victim in this adventure and plays the all so important task of commenting on everything in the most unoriginal way possible. By this point you'll realised you've found what anime archaeologists call \"cliche\". It doesn't get any better from there with the full generic set of side character who felt like they need a pair of square brackets with the words \"Insert unique characteristics\" embedded in them.\\n\\n\r\n\"Alright, it had generic character, what anime doesn't?\" - You say. While I can't expect every anime to have a totally original set of characters with an unheard of combinations of traits, I expect it to use it's generic base structure to construct a unique plot or series of situations that I haven't seen more than a dozen times before. And unfortunately the anime fails to do that with the set ups for jokes always being ones that almost force you to roll your eyes as you anticipate the sexual comedic situation that they thought up - which are barely on par with the comedic product of a 7th grader new to puberty giggling over the mention of the word \"Penis\" in his biology classes. It come nowhere near the lever as Seitokai Yakuindomo which had it's petty boring moments but created an elaborate twist of events that lead to funny misunderstanding and setups for really good puns and clever sex jokes. Here we get no elaborate situation outside of the characters looking at people in the wrong angle - hence misunderstanding a situation that takes effort to misinterpret. It starts to get old when the main characters act surprised in situations that they would clearly be able to decrypt and class as a misunderstanting - at least in Seitokai Yakuindomo the characters were shown to be aware that there was a misunderstanding but went with the flow purposefully because they enjoyed messing with the main character - in ShoBitch there's a constant stream of what seems like genuine shock followed by a reset in all emotion and a full sweep on any saved data from previous situations - which make me reminiscent of how a brand new episodes of the Simpsons started post 2007 where the consequence of actions were volatile. \\n\\n\r\nSo why bother giving it a score above the lowest? Well I can't lie and say there wasn't genuinely good puns and jokes here and there - though that quantity of them is minuscule to the point that the the really bad ones eclipse it. I also can't say the above average art style didn't enchant me enough to keep me from dropping it. The art isn't amazing but from other anime I've seen like this - such as hajimete no gal - I can say it deserves some brownie points for the slightly better art direction (and story direction considering how unbearable Hajimete no gal's plot got). It is by all means watchable, there's just not much you'll get out of it. It won't have you slamming your head on the table as much as some other mentionable Ecchi comedy anime and I think many will enjoy the somewhat disturbing \"homosexual misunderstandings\" - If I can paraphrase it to that, they're definitely one of the most extreme jokes when it comes to misunderstanding between 2 male characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to be said about the generic sound track so I think I'll conclude. Who is this anime for? Probably people who are into 7th grade dirty humour or new to the ecchi comedy genre of anime and don't want something as intense as Seitokai Yakuindomo. However even if that is the case I'd recommend you just don't bother wasting your time and search for an alternative, because this anime will frankly put you off the genre if you're giving it's your first try and it will leave you unsatisfied if you came for a good laugh, a decent romance or even something to tease your sexual desires with (If you're looking for ecchi you're better off somewhere else, this is pretty much void of it visually other than covered breasts moving around). If you want the a better alternative with 2 seasons and an upcoming movie go look up the one I've referenced 3 times now, I don't think I need to retype it here.",

            "content": "I'm seeing an absolute smattering of ones for this show- and I can certainly see why it's being received so poorly, but I myself cannot in good conscious give this show a rating of \"one\", which MAL describes as \"pathetic\", or \"appalling\". It simply isn't that awful.\r\nSTORY: \"Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken\" (from herein referred to as \"Sho-bitch\") is a sketch comedy anime through and through. It's structured episodically, as opposed to serially- meaning there's no continuously running plot or need to remember minor details that may come back down the line.  There is very little to mention in terms ofstory, really- local MC goes to school and is shocked at the lack of innocence possessed by the girls around him. He tries to be a good boyfriend to rather inexperienced and outlandish class-rep girlfriend. As is life in \"moderately ecchi comedy\" land.\\n\\n\r\nART: I can literally only say that it's \"okay\". It does nothing interesting visually, save for a couple slightly funny sight gags here and there.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: OP and ED are not my thing, well produced enough. Sho-bitch overuses audio clips criminally however- putting them over splash cards and playing them at every gag. The sound otherwise is okay at best, hence my 1 point reduction from \"average\" in the sound category.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: MC Haruka Shinozaki is undeveloped, and his other half- whom the show is really named after, the \"loyal virgin bitch\"- Akiho Kousaka is underdeveloped as well. Their relationship goes nowhere exciting through multiple dates (and the episodes encompassing them). Both characters are quite monotonous in nature, at day's end. While this is excusable for the deadpan comedy Akiho Kousaka uses, it is quite annoying when Haruka Shinozaki reacts with the same absurdist phrases every single time he notices some absurd sexual innuendo. It's almost insulting to the viewer really- he's shocked when we're supposed to be shocked, quiet and listening when something \"\"intriguing\"\" is happening- the writers of the show are quite unsubtle in telling us how we're supposed to feel through Haruka. Several minor characters pop-up here and there, but not a single one of them is worth mentioning in the slightest. Every side character is a textbook trope and/or uninteresting- from \"creepy overtly sexual *heavy breathing*\" girl to \"ONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-CHAAAAAAAAAAAN\" girl. The show had some potential in this department, and squandered it.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I laughed a couple times, not going to lie. But for every joke that got me, 20 more made me groan and wish for death's embrace solely.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: It's somewhat entertaining and wholly trashy. If it's your thing/you can bear it/you're really bored, it might be worth a shot. There's worse stuff out there, but unless you're some 500 days into the medium, I guarantee there's better things out there.\\n\\n\r\n3/10",

I think anyone who enjoys dirty jokes this would be what you're looking for. \r\nFor the current 4 episodes, the comedy and romance is balance except for the first 2 episodes, so just sit through 2 episodes and the rest was very entertaining and enjoyable. \r\nAs for the story it's currently not muchbecause they are still introducing new characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only part I don't like would have to be how \"kiddy\" the male MC sound.",

Don't be put off by the first episode, which may appear to be a little dry.\r\nThe characters themselves have depth and you do see them, although, I suppose you could say that most go in the wrong direction...

            "content": "I had read a lot of negative reviews about this anime, and in fact, I agreed with most opinions. But at different angles, I want to give this series some love. It\u2019s a perfect one for someone has a little pervert in mind and termless imagination.   \r\nThe plot is really simple: daily comedy school life and romance.  Shinozaki Haruka is a normal male student who crushes on Kousaka Akiho, a proficient class monitor aka the perfect representative of every student in school. He tries to confess her and realizes her \u201cspecial\u201d hobbies. Despite of that, he still want to get along withher, also find a lot of interesting sides about Kousaka and friends. \\n\r\nAnd about some of those friends, I still wonder how many porn films did they watch before classes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMisunderstanding is the main comedy factor in this series, more interesting to see characters reactions though. They don\u2019t try to make a joke, but the humor comes from conversations and situations naturally because of their characteristics. Watching this really darkens my mind through time with lots of sex jokes, which is a serious threat to who want to enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRomance, luckily, is quite normal and not gone too far.  Kousaka and Shinozaki love story is the highlight of this: a cute couple with no childish anger or jealous. Boy love, girl love and harem don\u2019t have a permanent appearance but enough to add some other colors to this series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGood OP and ED, but I thought it would be harem + ecchi throughout 10 episodes.\\n\r\nDiomedea and Blanc have made a great background, but characters designs aren\u2019t unified and still need more uniqueness, they have done it better in the last 5, 6 episodes though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, even though Sho-bitch has a lot of things to judge about, this anime can bring us a good medicine in a sad day. And, just like the medicine, it may not adapt to someone, so let\u2019s think carefully and decide whether you want to take it or not.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Everything rateable in the world should be rated in relation to what it aims to achieve, and no one kind of art is superior or inferior to others. Two statements that are central to the defence of Shobitch that I will try now, having taken a peek at the three out of four scored one reviews on the front page at the moment. I think this deserves better than that.\r\nAnd such, I mean, it's underrated. What does Shobitch try to do that they don't really succeed to? In essence it's a lewd joke show with romance in large doses, which is clear on the title,clear on the poster and clear in the synopsis, and should have been clear to the viewer, and it simply delivers just that.\\n\\n\r\nDoes it fail in the jokes? It doesn't. They basically throw every sex joke they can think of on the wall, take everything including the jokes that don't stick and barrage the viewer with it for 20 minutes straight- and I'd say everyone would find at least a few that sticks every episode, surely. This is more than I can say for much of the other comedy anime, or any anime that procures comedy as part of it to be fair. Maybe because of the language barrier, it's very hard to find comedy anime sketches that genuinely make you lose your breath, and even if sex jokes is a rather easy way to achieve universal larger-than-smirk laughs they do achieve and I'd have to commend them for that.\\n\\n\r\nDoes it fail in the romance? No. This is a preference thing, but because they are polar opposites in tone I'd expect most people to at least like one out of Akiho and Shizuku- and they both have lots of scenes that can satisfy the viewers. They even take time out of every episode to develop the relationship somewhat and endear the couple to the viewers in a different tone. Does it beat around the bush and become a frustrating drawn out romance? Nah again, they set it in stone in the first episode and run with it, to the point and without any frills, without any embarrassment. What's not to like?\\n\\n\r\nThen is there any huge problems that drag the show down? Obnoxious as fuck characters? Not really. Stale writing? No, I'd even write it in as a compliment. Bad visuals? It's definitely cheap, but it's adequate enough. This kind of show is just fine with this level of art. Does it get boring at any point? Absolutely not. Frantic, fast every minute.\\n\\n\r\nThen why's the score a 6? Much of the jokes still don't really work(naturally, per above), there wasn't a 'great' episode and there's an innate cheapness that is hard to deny. But are there any fatal faults that warrant such a low score, as is currently? No. Not for me.",

            "content": "To be honest, I was looking forward to My Girlfriend is a Faithful Bitch (Sho-Bitch for short) at the start of the season. From what I could see, it was a bunch of cute girls making fun of the MC by being as lewd as possible. It didn\u2019t sound like anything amazing but it looked fun enough to give a try. I thought I was right with my judgement as the first few episodes were pretty funny and I genuinely enjoyed it. Then it just kept adding more and more characters, each lewder and dumber than the last one, and I slowly started to regretmy decision.\\n\\n\r\nAs I already said, I laughed at first. It didn\u2019t do anything extraordinary with the comedy but it was funny nevertheless. However, the show tried to become more and more extravagant with its lewdness, devolving into forced gags every single episode. At first, it only had the generic MC, an airhead girlfriend who can\u2019t figure out how to act in a relationship, and a childhood friend and little sister who were too close for comfort. This cast wasn\u2019t much but the jokes they created were just enough to make most chuckle. \\n\\n\r\nThat was until the cast slowly increased its numbers, which just overloaded the show. Each one would create misunderstanding after misunderstanding which got more and more unbelievable and unrealistic, throwing in an assortment of incest jokes, gay jokes, and public sex jokes. You just can\u2019t laugh at a show where a transfer student says she loves playing with hairy boys, which is what she calls her dogs for whatever reason, or when the most popular kid in school (who also happens to be gay) helps the MC to get better at baseball, which somehow manages to look and sound like him giving him a handjob from afar. \\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, it provides no breathing room as it transitions from scene to scene to show off the next new gag. The lack of a coherent flow just buries you under a mountain of bad comedy, making you want nothing more than to finish the episode already so you can be free of this torture. \\n\\n\r\nSho-Bitch tries way too hard to make the character's every piece of dialogue as dirty as possible that the only thing you can do is sigh in disbelief, unable to understand why these characters are so fucking stupid. After a while, the only time I could laugh was when someone running around went head first into a desk, which I think is a good representation of how much I dislike the cast. In fact, I will go as far as to say that by the time I reached the halfway mark, I hated every single character and would love nothing more to watch the entire school burn to the ground in a fiery blaze.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance isn\u2019t much better. It tries to be really sweet all the time, like the MC thanking his girlfriend for trying to make him lunch, even though it sent someone to the infirmary when they tasted it, or him trying to look cool in front of her by practising hitting a home run in secret. It really would have been sweet if the build-up to the romance wasn\u2019t riddled with the terrible humour mentioned above. When you can\u2019t take the show seriously, everything suffers, and the romance suffered the most.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason would be the actual couple. I said before that I hate all of them, but I was actually fine with Shinozaki and Kousaka (along with a few others) at the beginning. It was somewhat cute watching Kousaka try (fail) to understand Shinozaki's fetish so she can be a better girlfriend, but you soon grow tired of it. She just ends up looking like a massive idiot. Shinozaki ain't any better, as he doesn't have a defining characteristic about him. He's just there to either make a comment after each gag or be added to the evergrowing pile of misunderstandings. His boring personality doesn't stand out at all, making him more uninteresting than a bag of rocks.\\n\\n\r\nIt had a nice start. I\u2019ll give Sho-Bitch that, but what followed shortly after is unforgivable. If I haven\u2019t convinced you to avoid this show, then go for it. Proceed knowing the fact that you\u2019ll probably be in excruciating mental pain as you try to force your way through this disaster disguised as entertainment. I know I said I enjoyed it at first, but giving this show a higher score just would not sit right with me.",

The problem is that the main heroine doesn't know how to act like a human being, instead she confuses everything and transform it into sex jokes. This \"anomaly\" happens a lot, it doesn't stop, it never stops, it just get worse time by time, you can see around 5 jokes in a row every 2 or 4 minutes, is not even funny, it is very disgusting and cringe inducing, there is absolutely NOTHING worth about the story on all the 4 episodes I've seen, and I think it is way too much to call it a day, if the show will maintain the same formula for the rest of the season, I'll rather stop here and warn people from wasting their time. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter hearing that, I don't think that people might be interested at all about the other aspects, but I'll take them in mind if someone ever wants to read it. The animation is your average budget for generic anime, there is nothing really special about it, there might be a character out there that you like for its design,  but I think that's all about it. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, at its best consist on character's VA of girls acting abnormally horny against the main character, it gets annoying pretty fast, the soundtrack doesn't even hit, nothing special on this point. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of this show are the characters, there's only 2 characters out there that I like just because they don't go around with an intense case of sex urgency, sadly for them, they got to meet the stupidest girl around that only thinks about sex, it doesn't matter if it involves underage girls, everything must be a sex joke, and not just that, the freaking childhood friend, and the little sister of the Main Character also has extreme urgency for dicks, I just don't know what the fuck is going on anymore, these characters doesn't even make any sense, not even for an Ecchi, it is just ridiculous. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nHow I expressed myself about the anime just shows how much I were enjoying it, Sadly, MAL doesn't include negative numbers, otherwise the count could have gone lower than -10 as Enjoyment factor. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10: Romance story goes wrong, girls wanting dicks 24/7, lame sex jokes, disturbing sex jokes, cringey sex jokes, nothing really worth it about it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I know that other people might like this show, and well I understand that and that's perfectly fine, this preview is aimed towards those people like me that expected a good romcom, but got nothing in exchange.",

            "content": "Great comedy anime, reminds me of the amazing Seitokai Yakuin Domo.\r\nDon't really understand all these people giving it 1/10. They're either 8 or 80 and don't know how to enjoy a comedy show or were expecting a completely different anime. As if they didn't knew in what they were getting into after reading the synopsys... (Or maybe there just weren't enough lolis? Who knows)\r\nSo, it's a great show for those who enjoy comedy, but if explicit jokes offend you, stay away from this.\r\nWhen it comes to characters, there's the mature ones, and the perverts, which creates many funny scenarios. There's not really any character development,but that's not the point for an anime like this anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent. It's the normal animation used nowadays. Can see that some money went into boobs physics. Nothing different or outstanding like Kujira no Kora or Hai to Gensou no Grimgar.\\n\\n\r\nThe ops and eds are your typical anime music. Nothing that I like too much but combines with the show, and that's what matters.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not really a story, here, just like Blend S or Himouto, things just happen, but here it's in a more funnier way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I enjoyed this so much. It's been a while since an anime made me laugh so much, and that's what anime is about. Enjoyment. You may think you're the best because the underrated boring show is your favorite of the season, while \"plebs\" are loving black clover, shokugeki and this, but that kinda attitude is the reason you have no friends. Like that annoying girl from Youkai Apato.\\n\r\nDon't force yourself into watching an anime. Don't like it? Go away. Enjoying it? Stay\\n\\n\r\nSo that's why I give it an overall 9. I enjoyed this and had a good time. Not the best show. But one worth watching to relax and chill after a hard day or just anytime.",

The truth is i even re-watch this series after a day i finished it. There were anime they said its good for the first time they watch it but this was the TYPE THAT GETS MORE ENJOYABLE ON SECOND WATCH.\r\nSTORY: the girl want to know more about her partner on a slightly different approach(thru fetish jokes). \"Storywas slow\" Oi!! their story starts on spring time and their time move slowly but many things happen. IT'S NOT YOUR NORMAL ANIME THAT JUMP SEASONS JUST FOR BIKINI AND SHRINE VISITING EVENTS... so many more should be coming if there was next season. \\n\\n\r\nART: two different anime studios collaborated on this series so don't ask for consistency of animation \"I ALSO SEE THE FLAWS BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT THAT MUCH\" for me.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: nothing bad to mention but \"ENDING THEME was TOO CUTE\".\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: every character has their time to shine. They don't overlap other character that was important and \"EVERY MAIN CHARACTER HAS THEIR UNIQUE TRAITS\".\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: i re-watched it already after a day. Has a HIGH RE-WATCH VALUE for me to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: GREAT!!! GONNA KEEP THIS ONE UNTIL I FIND TIME TO WATCH THIS AGAIN",

Every episode is centred around sexual puns and jokes. usually, you get a couple and you'regood for the week, you can go outside and think you're still a worthy person. Here you have erotic jokes literally every sentence. I'd like to say it's frustrating, but it's a tad more than that.\\n\r\nThere is thought a slight, small, thin, kinda invisible growth in the MCs. But you to pay a lot of attention to notice it.\\n\\n\r\nart: 3/10\\n\r\nok, the art is bad. is pretty, pretty bad, but there are worse shows around, so I'll try to be good here. There are no good visuals, no good backgrounds, no good animations (gosh, it's already hard to find an animation, actually). But, still. It's not abysmal as (a few) other animes. \\n\\n\r\nsound: 3/10\\n\r\nI swear I cannot remember a single note of the OP or whatever. And it would be nice to be able to say something about the background music if only I could recall background music.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nThere are actually just two characters in Sho-Bitch.\\n\r\nThe first is a useless, idiotic, subhuman MC that you just want to kick from here to eternity, most of all because you (I) can't understand how could he want to relate to someone like the \"heroine\". But most of all, how come that he doesn't take advantage of the whole situation. Are you a friggin man or what?\\n\r\nFor the second character. Well, it's like a conglomerate of horny women who apparently gravitate around the MC's dick in an endless fall. \\n\r\nThree, or four, completely identical characters that put you in the very hard position of hating them or just punch the monitor in front of you.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI'll just say that finding the least enjoyment in this show is the most enjoyable part.\\n\r\nIt's been very, very hard to get to the sixth episode, but I tend to give second chances. \\n\r\nNot here, not again\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something arousing, just skip this crap.",

            "content": "You see, there are different kinds of Harems out there. Some I consider to be light, kinda like Grisaia franchise, where despite the main hero being surrounded by girls, the anime itself focuses on the overall story rather than the sexual moments between the characters. While other I consider to be \"extreme\" in a way that the sexual harassment and suggestive jokes play the main role. Also I have to note that meanwhile I don't mind the light harems, I'm not really into the extreme one's, purely because I don't like echiiness as a whole.\r\nAnd now, there is Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch (willuse just Sho-bitch from now on). A show that possibly couldn't be more extreme. Cause the only things the show has to offer are tons of ecchi moments and a huge ammount of ambiguous jokes.\\n\\n\r\nYou may want to ask, why did I even started watching this since I don't like this type of anime. Well, my stupidity comes to play here, because I very rarely read something about shows before watching them, so I really didn't know anything about Sho-bitch coming into it.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, the show offers an experience full of ecchiness and ambiguity. Which in itself isn't a bad thing at all. Yeah, I don't really enjoy it myself, but there is a huge ammount of people who do. And I can actually say that the first two episodes were actually really funny.(Everybody has to laugh at dirty jokes from time to time, right?). \\n\\n\r\nThe main duo, that being Kousaka and Shinozaki, works very well together. Kousaka is a pretty weird girl, with an unexpectedly dirty thoughts. Shinozaki is a boy, who tries to balance her dirtyness by just being a normal human being. They're encounters are funny and their also kinda cute together. Also the craziness of their whole relationship can be called a positive thing.\\n\\n\r\nThis is however, where the whole problem of having a anime based on \"sexual jokes\" starts to shine. And the problem is simply being: You can't base your series solely on those two-way jokes. Yes, they can be funny at times, but they'll stop being funny immediately when you stack every episode with dozens of them. Not just that, but also the fact that the jokes became superly predictable. Seriously, every single joke is pretty much the same. And there is nothing worse than when a comedy anime becomes predictable, because it ultimately loses almost all of it's value.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I have are the other main/side characters. They are just super bland and a pure copies from another harems. You have a little sister, big sister, girl who likes to touch other girls etc. etc., and of course, everyone of them is sexually harassing the main hero. This time around, they don't even have a particular reason to do so. They are just there to provide the fan-service moments, that this show lives from.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is somewhat inconsistent. I really like the look of some characters, yet really dislike some other ones. The animation itself is also quite inconsistent. Which just means that some scenes look better than some others, which in itself is understandable, however it becomes very weird when it happens as much as here. The sound is not bad, but like somebody else stated in their review, the voice-actors seem to be quite limited by the way their character acts and reacts.\\n\\n\r\nSo what do I actually think about Sho-bitch? First and foremost, it's an anime for the fans of harem and ecchi stuff. And while I think the first two episodes were kinda funny, the obscure ammount of dirty jokes really did ruin the number of episodes I can take. Also the fact that the anime just stopped being funny way too quickly.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Dropped after episode 5.",

Overall if you enjoy comedy with a more sexual flare than you will enjoy this anime. \r\nMore In Depth:\r\nSound:\r\nThe soundtrack is alright but not very memorable It's not bad but it's not mind blowing pretty average.\r\nArt And Animation:\r\nThe art aesthetic looks really nice I'm abig fan of the more modern look of ecchi these days, and the animation is pretty decent nothing too bad so far.

This girl is inexperienced but perverted in a way always assuming his fetishes. This is fine for like maybe the first two episodes then it just gets boring and repetitive. It wasn't that funny to start with but now it complete cringe as the same jokes get made every episode but in different ways.\r\nI like the art and love the character designs. It cute and fun. Can't say much more about itthan that.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and voice actors push a cute vibe. You might find it annoying you might not. If you are into moe anime you would probably like it. The voice actors do seem limited by their characters though. they really only have one tone to stick to so it's hard to judge.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fine at the start but get old fast. like I said before it just the same jokes being repeated over and over so the characters get tiresome also. The personalities are special they stick to their roles and nothing else. It's rather boring. They added a new character but nothing much has changed if anything about the vibe this show gives off. If she wasn't added the story would be exactly the same. She is just a gateway to the tired jokes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, watch the first episode then drop it. that first episode is all you are going to be seeing throughout this. It's not a bad anime just boring to watch because there is never anything new.",

            "content": "I once read an review here on MAL on the anime \"School Days\", that said that the only value said anime had was for opening pickle jars or any activity involving \"brute strength\". The reason was that School Days made you so angry that you needed to relieve yourself of the aggression.\r\nWell, this anime doesn't even have that quality. It serves no purpose except waifu material but I can't see how anyone can stand any of these characters or their deranged obsession with innuendo. I'll try to just summarize the three Prime evils of this anime so you don't spend too much time even readinga review of this godawful anime.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the sound. Dramatic Movies often tend to overuse simple piano music for their tender moments, or sometimes the background noise sounds very artificial. The sound team behind this anime have no sense of overuse and decided that Visual Novel background noise was the way to go. You know the saxophone solo from \"Careless Whisper\" by George Michael? Imagen hearing that over and over again with a saxophone being played by a guy with throat cancer. It will drive you insane if you don't gnaw your own legs off.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the animation. It is not the worst animation quality I've seen, but it's up there with the likes of salad fingers. But salad fingers is redeemed. This anime isn't. They have loads of animation errors, routine misuse of the human anatomy that will persist throughout the show. And the background is just as bad as the foreground but in a lazy carefree way. Your eyes are getting tortured by two different technics at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally. The writing. Someone, a human like you and me, wrote the script of this anime and said it was okay. The inhuman use of bad innuendo is remarkable if this show has one thing going for it it's the effort they put in to make every sentence available to innuendo. They have destroyed any hint of a story for the sole purpose to have a couple of sex jokes. \\n\\n\r\nIn Summation. This anime will leave you brain-dead, blind, legless and with no pickles on your sandwich.\\n\\n\r\nNothing against the author of the Review from School Days, it was a great review wich shared some of my views.",

And, after the buildup of a whole month's wait for this new show is spent fantasizing over how cool something named Sho-bitch could possibly be, we find that this anime is merely a light novelty. Clearly, the show's story is going nowhere interesting whatsoever. The characters are just unfathomably easy to HATE. All the female characters act like impure harlots with minds that containsevere psychological trauma. And, the sho-bitch herself is a total freak. There is a wacky, cheesy, disgusting, unfunny booby / weewee joke around every single corner of the show too. The show in and of itself is nothing what I expected from the previews. I thought this would be about a pure romance between two real lovers, not miscellaneous horny freaks running amok. And that's another thing. Sho-bitch seems random for no reason; as if the writers are just lazy. No characters have any depth at all whatsoever so far. The story is without meaning. No particularly memorable or truly interesting dialogue, only greasy interactions between male and female, occasionally female on female. This anime probably only exists for horny 13 year olds to watch to see what their fresh pubescence has in store for them. There is nothing of value for a mature audience here. If you too are mature, looking for some show that's funny and entertaining while running with a romantic aspect to the show, trust me, and do not waste your time watching this garbage. It's completely worthless.",

As for the boy's uniform , wtf is the illustrator thinking about the boys uniform when it come to their pants, I mean what's with putting some cuffs on the bottom part of their pants? They could have made it more simpler by just having them wear blue pants both in winter and summer attire without any fancy shimancy crime of fashion, then again when it come with the girls school uniform , well nobody can go wrong with it as long as the skirt is short.\\n\\n\r\nFair 6, Sound:\\n\\n\r\nWell, since I have no comments about who did who, I'm just leaving this blank......\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3, Character:\\n\\n\r\nSo in every aspect we have a guy who's playing this goody in two shoes as he rebukes them girls sexual innuendo and green jokes, and as for the girls like Akiho, Shizuku, Kanata the imouto, Saori, Rina, sayo and gay guy Seiya were just soooo full of it. so, it is so poor poor.\\n\\n\r\nFair 6 , Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nOne silver lining about this anime was the relationship between between Akiho and Haruka, where we see them in a serious relationship, where it somehow, it is doing fine........and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3, Overall: \\n\\n\r\nEverything were just soooo silly......that only a LeFou would rate this higher. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGaston OUT,  PUUUUUTHWEEP  PTUI!!!!!!!!I've spitted again.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "[No spoiler review]\r\nIt's ironic that I just wrote that disclaimer, considering I'm about to tell you that there is nothing to spoil - unless of course you consider what is already a stale and flavourless anime as something worth consuming.\r\nIf you haven't notice by the score and opening line, I didn't enjoy this show, and don't think it's worth your time - which could be better spent proving Obama is white. Initially the anime draws you in with an interesting snippet from a future episode, one that was audacious and just screamed \"This anime is filled with ironic and over the top sexual humour\". Andthen we a greeted with the generic male protag who's just the observer/victim in this adventure and plays the all so important task of commenting on everything in the most unoriginal way possible. By this point you'll realised you've found what anime archaeologists call \"cliche\". It doesn't get any better from there with the full generic set of side character who felt like they need a pair of square brackets with the words \"Insert unique characteristics\" embedded in them.\\n\\n\r\n\"Alright, it had generic character, what anime doesn't?\" - You say. While I can't expect every anime to have a totally original set of characters with an unheard of combinations of traits, I expect it to use it's generic base structure to construct a unique plot or series of situations that I haven't seen more than a dozen times before. And unfortunately the anime fails to do that with the set ups for jokes always being ones that almost force you to roll your eyes as you anticipate the sexual comedic situation that they thought up - which are barely on par with the comedic product of a 7th grader new to puberty giggling over the mention of the word \"Penis\" in his biology classes. It come nowhere near the lever as Seitokai Yakuindomo which had it's petty boring moments but created an elaborate twist of events that lead to funny misunderstanding and setups for really good puns and clever sex jokes. Here we get no elaborate situation outside of the characters looking at people in the wrong angle - hence misunderstanding a situation that takes effort to misinterpret. It starts to get old when the main characters act surprised in situations that they would clearly be able to decrypt and class as a misunderstanting - at least in Seitokai Yakuindomo the characters were shown to be aware that there was a misunderstanding but went with the flow purposefully because they enjoyed messing with the main character - in ShoBitch there's a constant stream of what seems like genuine shock followed by a reset in all emotion and a full sweep on any saved data from previous situations - which make me reminiscent of how a brand new episodes of the Simpsons started post 2007 where the consequence of actions were volatile. \\n\\n\r\nSo why bother giving it a score above the lowest? Well I can't lie and say there wasn't genuinely good puns and jokes here and there - though that quantity of them is minuscule to the point that the the really bad ones eclipse it. I also can't say the above average art style didn't enchant me enough to keep me from dropping it. The art isn't amazing but from other anime I've seen like this - such as hajimete no gal - I can say it deserves some brownie points for the slightly better art direction (and story direction considering how unbearable Hajimete no gal's plot got). It is by all means watchable, there's just not much you'll get out of it. It won't have you slamming your head on the table as much as some other mentionable Ecchi comedy anime and I think many will enjoy the somewhat disturbing \"homosexual misunderstandings\" - If I can paraphrase it to that, they're definitely one of the most extreme jokes when it comes to misunderstanding between 2 male characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to be said about the generic sound track so I think I'll conclude. Who is this anime for? Probably people who are into 7th grade dirty humour or new to the ecchi comedy genre of anime and don't want something as intense as Seitokai Yakuindomo. However even if that is the case I'd recommend you just don't bother wasting your time and search for an alternative, because this anime will frankly put you off the genre if you're giving it's your first try and it will leave you unsatisfied if you came for a good laugh, a decent romance or even something to tease your sexual desires with (If you're looking for ecchi you're better off somewhere else, this is pretty much void of it visually other than covered breasts moving around). If you want the a better alternative with 2 seasons and an upcoming movie go look up the one I've referenced 3 times now, I don't think I need to retype it here.",

            "content": "I'm seeing an absolute smattering of ones for this show- and I can certainly see why it's being received so poorly, but I myself cannot in good conscious give this show a rating of \"one\", which MAL describes as \"pathetic\", or \"appalling\". It simply isn't that awful.\r\nSTORY: \"Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken\" (from herein referred to as \"Sho-bitch\") is a sketch comedy anime through and through. It's structured episodically, as opposed to serially- meaning there's no continuously running plot or need to remember minor details that may come back down the line.  There is very little to mention in terms ofstory, really- local MC goes to school and is shocked at the lack of innocence possessed by the girls around him. He tries to be a good boyfriend to rather inexperienced and outlandish class-rep girlfriend. As is life in \"moderately ecchi comedy\" land.\\n\\n\r\nART: I can literally only say that it's \"okay\". It does nothing interesting visually, save for a couple slightly funny sight gags here and there.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: OP and ED are not my thing, well produced enough. Sho-bitch overuses audio clips criminally however- putting them over splash cards and playing them at every gag. The sound otherwise is okay at best, hence my 1 point reduction from \"average\" in the sound category.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: MC Haruka Shinozaki is undeveloped, and his other half- whom the show is really named after, the \"loyal virgin bitch\"- Akiho Kousaka is underdeveloped as well. Their relationship goes nowhere exciting through multiple dates (and the episodes encompassing them). Both characters are quite monotonous in nature, at day's end. While this is excusable for the deadpan comedy Akiho Kousaka uses, it is quite annoying when Haruka Shinozaki reacts with the same absurdist phrases every single time he notices some absurd sexual innuendo. It's almost insulting to the viewer really- he's shocked when we're supposed to be shocked, quiet and listening when something \"\"intriguing\"\" is happening- the writers of the show are quite unsubtle in telling us how we're supposed to feel through Haruka. Several minor characters pop-up here and there, but not a single one of them is worth mentioning in the slightest. Every side character is a textbook trope and/or uninteresting- from \"creepy overtly sexual *heavy breathing*\" girl to \"ONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-CHAAAAAAAAAAAN\" girl. The show had some potential in this department, and squandered it.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I laughed a couple times, not going to lie. But for every joke that got me, 20 more made me groan and wish for death's embrace solely.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: It's somewhat entertaining and wholly trashy. If it's your thing/you can bear it/you're really bored, it might be worth a shot. There's worse stuff out there, but unless you're some 500 days into the medium, I guarantee there's better things out there.\\n\\n\r\n3/10",

It\u2019s a perfect one for someone has a little pervert in mind and termless imagination.   \r\nThe plot is really simple: daily comedy school life and romance.  Shinozaki Haruka is a normal male student who crushes on Kousaka Akiho, a proficient class monitor aka the perfect representative of every student in school. He tries to confess her and realizes her \u201cspecial\u201d hobbies. Despite of that, he still want to get along withher, also find a lot of interesting sides about Kousaka and friends. \\n\r\nAnd about some of those friends, I still wonder how many porn films did they watch before classes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMisunderstanding is the main comedy factor in this series, more interesting to see characters reactions though. They don\u2019t try to make a joke, but the humor comes from conversations and situations naturally because of their characteristics. Watching this really darkens my mind through time with lots of sex jokes, which is a serious threat to who want to enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRomance, luckily, is quite normal and not gone too far.  Kousaka and Shinozaki love story is the highlight of this: a cute couple with no childish anger or jealous. Boy love, girl love and harem don\u2019t have a permanent appearance but enough to add some other colors to this series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGood OP and ED, but I thought it would be harem + ecchi throughout 10 episodes.\\n\r\nDiomedea and Blanc have made a great background, but characters designs aren\u2019t unified and still need more uniqueness, they have done it better in the last 5, 6 episodes though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, even though Sho-bitch has a lot of things to judge about, this anime can bring us a good medicine in a sad day. And, just like the medicine, it may not adapt to someone, so let\u2019s think carefully and decide whether you want to take it or not.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Everything rateable in the world should be rated in relation to what it aims to achieve, and no one kind of art is superior or inferior to others. Two statements that are central to the defence of Shobitch that I will try now, having taken a peek at the three out of four scored one reviews on the front page at the moment. I think this deserves better than that.\r\nAnd such, I mean, it's underrated. What does Shobitch try to do that they don't really succeed to? In essence it's a lewd joke show with romance in large doses, which is clear on the title,clear on the poster and clear in the synopsis, and should have been clear to the viewer, and it simply delivers just that.\\n\\n\r\nDoes it fail in the jokes? It doesn't. They basically throw every sex joke they can think of on the wall, take everything including the jokes that don't stick and barrage the viewer with it for 20 minutes straight- and I'd say everyone would find at least a few that sticks every episode, surely. This is more than I can say for much of the other comedy anime, or any anime that procures comedy as part of it to be fair. Maybe because of the language barrier, it's very hard to find comedy anime sketches that genuinely make you lose your breath, and even if sex jokes is a rather easy way to achieve universal larger-than-smirk laughs they do achieve and I'd have to commend them for that.\\n\\n\r\nDoes it fail in the romance? No. This is a preference thing, but because they are polar opposites in tone I'd expect most people to at least like one out of Akiho and Shizuku- and they both have lots of scenes that can satisfy the viewers. They even take time out of every episode to develop the relationship somewhat and endear the couple to the viewers in a different tone. Does it beat around the bush and become a frustrating drawn out romance? Nah again, they set it in stone in the first episode and run with it, to the point and without any frills, without any embarrassment. What's not to like?\\n\\n\r\nThen is there any huge problems that drag the show down? Obnoxious as fuck characters? Not really. Stale writing? No, I'd even write it in as a compliment. Bad visuals? It's definitely cheap, but it's adequate enough. This kind of show is just fine with this level of art. Does it get boring at any point? Absolutely not. Frantic, fast every minute.\\n\\n\r\nThen why's the score a 6? Much of the jokes still don't really work(naturally, per above), there wasn't a 'great' episode and there's an innate cheapness that is hard to deny. But are there any fatal faults that warrant such a low score, as is currently? No. Not for me.",

            "content": "This anime is a slice of life which is probably my favorite genre because I always expect something new and original from these, Sadly most of them turn out to be the cliche badly written romance which is pretty disappointing but on the other hand some of them turn out to be great and extremely enjoyable and i have to say that this anime is just that.\r\nWhen I finished Tsurezure Children i was sad that something that enjoyable and fun to watch in terms of character interactions and romance (which was actually good for once) ended, the type of anime where i could watch itwithout having to worry about useless drama or making ships throughout the whole season was refreshing so for it to end left me wondering what other anime can actually be enjoyable and just like that, and while there is gintama airing this season and it sadly not being to as good as the other seasons but still has a very good run so far I started watching other stuff and that's when i found this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken is pretty much a mixture of Seitokai Yakuindomo and Tsurezure Children and keeping a very well-balance between those two parts. The romance was good, the characters were nice and the overall atmosphere and jokes was very entertaining, so I started watching this every week and with the final episode out now I have to say that this was a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a slice of life so i'll just talk about the characters since there is particularly no story because just like I wrote this is a SOL anime.\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are good and tho sometimes cliche they never get too cliche that make you just hate them, for example we had a good MC that had actual good points unlike the MC from Sakurasou who was just a horrible person or an extremely boring like the one from Gabriel dropout, the MC here is kind and not the generic \"oh he is an MC so he must be kind\" but more because of the way his actions are presented in the anime and the way he acts with everyone from his sister to the rest of the characters, the heroine was a calm good girl that was never good at interacting with other people but she gets development more and more as the show progresses, the sister who is the all talk but no action type of character but has more than just that as her only characteristic , the gay character which was kinda unique to see and the way the heroine would get anxious over the MC when he was talking was him was kinda refreshing to see because it was different from the whole \"Add a new guy at the end and let the MC get worried\" and those useless drama parts being put out there for a lack of creativity and presenting a new character and using comedy instead of romance in that introduction, the other characters I could call them good or good enough characters at least to be considered acceptable side characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there are 2 bad things in particular about this anime, one of them is the animation and the inconsistency of the art, the second one being too many perverted jokes in some episodes and i understand why that would be annoying to some people but the fact even though this anime had lots of those jokes in it, the way it was presented was in most of the time great which is why i enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude: the anime is great and it has its good and bad points like any other anime but it's understandable if someone got bored of it because firstly it is a SOL anime and lots of people dislike that genre and secondly because there were too many perverted jokes with bad timing/presentation in some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i would give this a 9/10 because it was incredibly enjoyable for me.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it for anyone that likes SOL Anime.",

            "content": "\"Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken\"\r\nSo.. what is it about? Ecchi? Romance? or.. does it also contain harem? \r\nWell.. fortunately or unfortunately, it contains all of that. But.. are those genres uncommon? Obviously no.. when those things come together, usually it's just another half-assed seasonal anime with the same old story line. In other words, the cancer of the anime and manga industry. With ecchi as a tag, I'm sure it is one of the only main attractions of this series. Kind of disappointing am I right? Who needs to watch this series that's so predictable and similar to most titles? Why shouldyou watch this? Well... ladies and gentlemen I will now tell you why I am one of the critiques who gave a higher rating for this series. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, people get the wrong idea about these types of series. There are viewers who overhype a new airing series and somehow get disappointed later on. People tend to forget that this was just a series that was made for the LoLs and they expect it to be something that will be new and unique. This is not a series that is supposed to be seriously taken into account. This is just a series that will soothe those viewers who can't get over after finishing a drama and use this to get a good laugh in order to take the sorrows away. You do not watch comic relief with a serious mindset... you let lose and let out great laughs. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the main review.\\n\\n\r\nThe main selling point of this series is the comedy itself and I tell you that you will get great laughs even though the point of the jokes is always the same... misunderstanding. I can't count how many times I burst out laughing even if I was expecting the joke or event to happen. I can't really help it if the elements come together like that. The story, with all due respect, is all but cliche in every way. You may sometimes stop and think \"God, this show is so stupid\" but you will say that while bursting out laughing because that's how this show is. The artstyle, damn... even an average joe will realize that the art wasn't even given any much effort to. You can see how well drawn are the background characters and other miscellaneous objects. Especially that one guy who was all colored in green. So much effort put into making that guy. The sound... well.. atleast I can say it's decent considering an ecchi anime will have ecchi opening and ending themes.. I guess the studios took that into account. The characters.. one thing I can say is... What the f**k... every cliche ecchi-harem situation characters, the full set, you name it... this has it. With that overall, yes there's nothing unique about this show and even the jokes aren't really that new to me because this had a similar feel to Seitokai Yakuindomo which is another series similar to this, the only difference is the level of romance in this show. I forgot to mention that though this show is full of cancerous cliche s**t, atleast the Romance factor is well enough to be.... Exciting!!... \\n\r\nSo if you want me to say one good thing about it, I assure you that this is one of the only good things about this show. Thank you for reading this review and I hope you understood it very well.",

I went into it expecting a mediocre ecchi harem romance full of fanservice and dirty jokes, yet somehow my expectations were too high. \r\nThey could have produced a halfway decent show centered around the concept of a relationship between the plain boring protagonist and a cute girl who is simultaneously perverted in her mind but inexperienced and innocent in terms of a real relationship. Making dick jokes one minute and blushing at the thought of holding hands the next. Instead it is a race to the bottomthat continuously reaches farther and farther to make everything lewd. \\n\\n\r\nWatching this show is like watching that one kid you knew in high school say \"That's what she said!\" to everything he hears. At first it's pretty funny, until everyone else but him is tired of it.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is only 10 episodes long yet it manages to wear out its welcome after only 2 or 3. As an airing show, it was something to numb the mind or hate-watch between the weekly episodes of better shows. As a completed series, I can't think of any good reason to watch it. If you must, then avoid sobriety at all costs.",

            "content": "ShoBitch is exactly what it says on the tin: a full-length anime episode with non-stop lewding and dirty jokes. It never promised anything more and I won't fault it for that.\r\nWhat I will fault it for is the fact the jokes got stale about 1/3 of the way into the series. The episodes are \"boy talks to girl, girl has a lewd misinterpretation, boy further misinterprets ad nauseum until we finish the episode\". What variation comes in the form of other girls (the younger sister and the best friend) but they more-or-less repeat the \"who can make the lewdest statements\" game.  Don't get mewrong, there's some fun to be had, but it's hard to see why they decided to stretch it into full-length episodes instead of sticking with a 15-minute length \u00e0 la Aho-Girl. Variation doesn't come until we're well into the series when we're introduced to the other main male character, but he arrives a little too late. We're left with characters who make you wonder if they've experienced sexual trauma or were isolated from people.  \\n\\n\r\nStill, every so often it lands a nice joke, whether it's the imagined yuri between the main girl and the main guy's Haruka best friend or the main guy finally having enough of these antics, but there's not enough. You will laugh, but not as often as you roll your eyes. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, ShoBitch is redeemed by Aoi Yuki, who plays Akiho, the \"good girl\" who manages to lewd every conceivable situation. As we've come to expect, she plays the role with just the right amount of naivete, so you almost believe a near-adult woman could believe these things. That's about it for the characters. Everybody else is a trope: self-insert MC with his clingy younger sister, the lesbian friend, the will-they-won't-they best friend and the overly-sexual gay guy who isn't subtle at all. \\n\\n\r\nI've also argued ShoBitch has a halfway decent romance lurking below the low-hanging fruit which rears its head every now-and-then. We get to see the main boy and the main girl develop their relationship beyond mere interest up until the credits roll for the final time. I was shocked as this is something missing from better series.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's a fun romp in short bursts. Don't go in expecting anything that pushes the boundary in any new & innovative way. Definitely don't binge it.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nNot much to story. The usual high school slice-of-life comedy with a bit romance. The quirk this time around is that most characters have rather lewd mind.\r\nFor the most part I enjoyed the sexual jokes and dia/monologues. Chuckled quite few times and as whole found it quite enjoyable.\r\nProbably biggest 2 issues I found about this Anime would be the following. First of all, I felt that romantic progression was a bit too minimal for my taste, but that was eased for me with the finale, which wasfairly sweet.\\n\\n\r\nSecond issue I felt that for this type of comedy episodes were too long and felt too packed. As if 4-koma Manga got packed into 24min episodes. Here solution would been either having shorter episodes (max 12min) or have 24minutes more \"full\" rather than packed mess.\\n\\n\r\nBut do have to mention. Thank god this is light-hearted comedy Anime. If it would been a Hentai with it's specific fitting character, then I would despise this Anime as I can already imagine how such lewd-minded fairly \"pure\" characters would end up being mislead or used. So big kudos it being light-hearted with absolutely respectable main male character.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I have to mention that the title is quite misleading. Seriously, the \"girlfriend\" wasn't a bitch in any manner. Simply lewd minded. But more about that in characters section.\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow to sum it up. I found the \"story\" the weakest point of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nAnimation and art was good enough, but didn't really impress me as much. Meaning it was fitting, but nothing special. Also considering how lewd dialogues this Anime had, I'm surprised how minimally it had visual stimuli or innuendos.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music/OST. I have to say I did for the most part didn't notice it, but when I focused more to it. It felt fairly pleasant and bright.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nMale MC - the character who had the toughest part of having being the decent guy, who is kind and caring and has to constantly keep up the straight-man slapstick comedy act whilst being surrounded by such a dirty minded women.\\n\\n\r\nOur female MC - the girlfriend. Is a bit socially awkward person with fairly odd sexual mindsets. Would say she is perverted, but she is oddly \"lewd\" not as the rest of the cast, who are blatantly lewd minded. Anyhow, I did like her a lot. Very caring, interesting and loyal girlfriend with a little oddity element.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I won't bother explaining all other characters. But long story short, most of them are virgins, who simply have really perverted mind. That well, in different kind of Anime/story/situation/world would bring a dark turn of twists and problems. But thankfully it isn't that type of Anime. And well, they fairly relatable characters. In sense that I can be also quite lewd with my mindset but I am bound to my moral compass of not going in any sort of loose relationship. So if want to lewd, do it only with one I truly care about. Other than that, fiction and mind had satisfy the lewdness. \\n\\n\r\nANYHOW.. only characters can be defined \"bitch\" as title claims this word. Could be, but not necessary might be are the nurse character and the ojou-sama yuri bait. They seem the only \"succubi\"  around there.\\n\\n\r\nThere were few more \"clean\" characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short. Characters are pure, but lewd minded. Which for the most part were quite enjoyable and fun to listen to and see them reacting.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nI think I already mentioned everything I wanted to. It's a sexual themed comedy Anime with pure, but lewd minded women, whereas the male lead character is the one with the tough part of having to put up straight man act. \\n\\n\r\nThe queen of this type Anime is \"Seitokai Yakuindomo\". But nevertheless, in the end this Anime was fairly enjoyable and made me chuckle few times. First I wanted give it solid 6, but then I started to dwell and I felt that I enjoyed it more than I thought. Thus decided to bump up the score as I am rather soft to things I enjoy.",

Honestly fantastic job bonus points for that.\r\nStory (7/10) surprised to say but it was good for what it was. I mean it is a run of the mill relationship with a twist. The romance itself is pretty classic.\r\nThe twist is well, Kousaka and Haruka two truly unique personalities! More info at the characters section...\r\nArt. I have one thing to say. Great colors and character models. Congrats! Loved them! (10/10)\r\nSound was very good. Indeed worth an 8/10.\r\nCharacter design. Before I explain I have to say thatit was OUSTANDING 10/10. Some of you are skeptical I know. Every character support or main was very well made and though out (there is only one exception and thank god she doesn't appear too much and it is Sayo).\\n\\n\r\nAkiho Kousaka, amazing, truly. There is only one question for you reading this review. Do you like dirty jokes. If the answer is yes you will love her, her mother and the classy childhood friend  and little sister combo. In greater detail, she looks like a smart but inexperienced, awkward and shy girl but instead she is a closet pervert with a fantastic sense of dirty humor (just like her mother by the way).\\n\\n\r\nKanata, classic little sister  with brother complex.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku, the most amazing childhood friend. 12/10 rating just for her.\\n\\n\r\nHoshikawa, Seiya. The greatest gay friend in an anime. Fantastic looks I can see why the ladies in the school are all over him and a great sense of humor as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist is an absolute classy gentleman! Haruka, what a man! Do you except a pervert degenerate like in high school DXD to make an appearance. NO!, instead you get one of the most unique characters I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10. There is one thing I would change in this category, to get the perfect 10 they should have progressed a little more before the anime ended. No II don't want this to b e a hentai just show a little more passion and romance progression.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 9/10. Well deserved in my opinion.",

            "content": "I really do love a good comedy from time to time,  and shobitch was a lot of fun packed into just 10 episodes.  This Anime is wall to wall covered in innuendo and X rated subject matter,  so I would recommend only mature persons without disdain for low brow humor give it a go.\r\n                Sho-bitch has a very simple story basedaround the protagonist and his love interest.  The spice here is that this anime takes that simple story and drowns it in awkward situations and adult humor.  It definitely crosses lines but is very consistent in doing so.  I would go as far as to say \"parody\" wouldn't be a bad genre to categorize sho-bitch,  as the toilet humor is meant to be more humorous than erotic. Despite the subject matters being mature rated the show never resorts to nudity or genuine fan service to create humor.  Sho-bitch definitely offers unique perspectives and not so typical situations from seemingly stereotypical characters.   The story  is simple, its sweet,  its lewd, and  most importantly its hilarious.  A detracting factor for me was the anime kind of built a continuity around certain situations making it repetitive, but each episode did have unique jokes and situations making it watchable till the end.\\n\\n\r\n                The art is quite average and not very flashy, but also very bright and warm.  There might not be a lot going on but every scene did feel like some consideration was taken for the story they were trying to tell.  It did feel like a more modern animation and I can live with the simplicity when a \"slice of life\" type situation governs scenery and movement choices.  \\n\\n\r\n           The the songs and sound effects were also good,  again nothing to write home about,  but everything audible down to the performances of the voice actors was perfectly fine and decently entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n         The characters make this show.   I wont go into much detail about them, but everyone from the protagonist down are what make sho-bitch so hilarious.   Any other individuals or archetypes would have failed miserably for this type of parody story.  So the characters are really a tribute to the amount of consideration that went into the making of  this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n              When its all said and done,  I did enjoy sho-bitch .  Your  pal Grizzziff Kingsbeard drops an overall 6/10,  and that's perfectly fine. Not every anime can be top shelf, and that's  o.k. in my book.  It could have been better, but given the material it could have been a lot worse!",

It is a harem/ecchi anime, and yet it didn't try to shove boobs up your face in every situation possible, also, it actually had a romance instead of 5 girls chasing after the same guy without anything happening.\r\nMainly, I would consider this show a comedy. It is packed (and I mean, PACKED) with pervy/sex jokes, and basically every dialogue is phrased in some form that it gets misunderstood by others. Of course it is absolutely needless to say that the situationswere highly unrealistic, but you wouldn't really watch such a show for its realism anyway.\\n\r\nFor me, every single episode made me laugh. \\n\\n\r\nAll the episodes are pretty similar content-wise, so you can just give it a try - if you dislike the first ep, there's definitely no point in continuing.",

            "content": "I was actually fairly surprised by this anime, seeing how low of a score it had and how much hate it was getting.\r\nI got into this anime thinking that it would be similar to many other similar animes where sex jokes is the big focus. It wasn't really like that at all and especially the first episode made me doubt whether it would be worth it to watch and if it would actually be pretty bad, it actually made me cringe with the kinda ridiculous yet not powerfully delivered jokes that were present. However, after 2-3 episodes, I found out that this was actually quiteenjoyable in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does have a lot of sex jokes. That's true. However, I feel it was lacking that special \"oomph\" or \"sting\" that you usually get in an anime such as this. It was fairly slow and it wasn't really over the top like they usually are. The jokes ARE indecent for sure, there's a lot of stuff like that going on, but it wasn't high-paced and completely without a story, nor were the jokes so ridiculous that you laugh at them simply because it's something that would never happen and is so surreal you find it baffling.\\n\\n\r\nI found this to be a pretty nice anime, the relationship between the mc and the girlfriend was actually pretty good, we could see it developing and it felt pretty sweet in a way. The indecency was often fairly funny as well, quite a few of the jokes were relatively clever for a show like this. I loved how concerned his girlfriend was about him, and her actions due to that, which came across as a clumsy attempt to fulfill her role as a girlfriend and because of her own jealousy, was pretty well done.\\n\\n\r\nIt's certainly not the best anime out there, but I think it was a really good one nonetheless, it's unusual and I feel that the low score, which it doesn't deserve, is because some people came here without understanding the nature of this show and expected something else, thus they give it a low and unfair score. I recommend this show, but be prepared that every female around will be kinda lewd or at least love dirty jokes and the whole show revolves around dirty jokes overall, yet it's still fairly slow compared to similar shows and the romance is more important and well done than in those shows as well. 8/10, undoubtedly.",

            "content": "I think the one who actually saw that this anime contained dirty joke and all, just take the negative comment of the others reviewer with a grain of salt. The reviewers who criticise the sexual innuendo in this anime as if they doesn't see it coming were obviously came to a wrong place. Somehow it upset me when they speak as if it is just a dirty anime. The dirty joke is meant to be the comedy part and there are also an equal part of romance in this anime as well. TO me, the romance is nothing short of perfect as Akiho and Harulove story is very good especially during the last episode. It is the kind of scene you found in Shoujo Romance.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this anime is a story following our main protagonist and schoolboy, Shinozaki Haruka who finally mans up and decides to confess his love to the class rep, Kousaka Akiho. Much to his chagrin and surprise she says yes.\\n\\n\r\nI know what you're thinking, its just gonna be another light-hearted romcom, and in a way it is but what Kousaka says next turns the tables on this romcom type cliche, \"I'll start by memorizing 48 sex positions\".\\n\\n\r\nIf you have seen Seitokai Yakuindomo then you will highly enjoy this as they have the same type of humour as each other. Filled with sexual innuendos and loads of anime relief this story will make you burst not just laughing; if you catch my drift.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the story more characters will be added to the fray, most of which will be, in a sense, fetish cliche characters that we find in other anime i.e. brocon, childhood friend, rich girl. This artwork is pretty good however the characters have little development as of yet.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a time passer, want to laugh, and can understand at least some sex humour, then this is the show for you.",

            "content": "Yay it's a sex comedy.... but without the sex and the comedy was bad. This is unfortunately very poor attempt to make an ecchi harem comedy based on dirty jokes. Jokes are very dirty yes, but they are hardly funny. Many of these jokes are  predictable, awkward or just boring. At first I was not sure why they felt so bad. I usually love sexually themed humour. Then I came to a conclusion that timing and voice acting were ruining most of the actually pretty delicious jokes. They were too predictable, lasted too long and they were often taken too far. In the endthey were no more jokes and it feels like some weird pervy stuff just happens for no reason. Many things that definitely shouldn't be said out loud is said out loud but it doesn't feel funny, just weird. Most puns are impossible to understand in English and most are probably not that good in Japanese either.      \\n\\n\r\nStory 3: Poor love story overall. No real character development. Main character Haruka Shinozaki is boring as hell. He has no redeeming qualities really, he is \"normal\" guy and he likes the main girl Akiho Kosaka because she is pretty and seems smart and responsible. But when they start dating it turns out Kosaka wants to know everything about sex and be a perfect girlfriend, respectable goal I think but it seems to be an obsession. So what is supposed to be funny is this Kosaka's obsession of sex. But obsessions are not necessarily funny. It's like watching an alcoholic who drinks, it's more sad than funny. Most jokes are about Kosaka studying sexual things and talking all sorts of pervy stuff and Shinozaki trying to act normal. That is supposed to be funny. For me it was not. \\n\\n\r\nArt 3: Rather ugly art style IMHO. Animation was at times very poor quality and it was obviously low-budget. Nothing to write home about. \\n\\n\r\nSound 3: Voice acting was at times amateurish IMHO, I think that better acting could've also saved some of the jokes. Maybe....Acting was mostly not that bad as writing or art was, but overall it was very generic.  Music was very poor. Opening song was one of the worst I've ever heard. Very forgettable ending song as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4: Main guy Haruka Shinozaki is boring, he has no personality to talk about. Akiho Kosaka is obsessed about sex and is also pretty boring otherwise. There are attempts of cute scenes between them, but they feel mostly awkward attempts of romance that don't work. There are all sorts of pretty stereotypical side characters like clinging little sister, clinging Onee-chan from neigbour, clinging rich girl who knows nothing of men, clinging gay guy.... all these characters seem to be clinging to Shinozaki because he is so nice. This seems to mean that despite all those unscrupulous intimacies of those characters he stays as their friend. My favorite was probably the gay guy... surprisingly there is no fujoshi-character to enjoy about his interactions with Haruka (who has broken gaydar of course) which was actually quite refreshing, instead these near-BL moments made Akiho jealous. This in turn made supposedly funny scenes surprisingly serious which didn't really work that well.   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6:\\n\r\nI laughed like 5 or 6 times total when watching this 10 episodes long show, and some of those laughs were caused simply by bewilderment. I was so surprised how bad this show was at times that it made me laugh. So I guess that can be counted as enjoyment...\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4: Very forgettable attempt of ecchi/ sexual comedy, lots of missed opportunities to make it funny. Some ideas were actually nice, but in the end achievement was probably one of the worst ecchi shows ever.",

Lewd humor is abundant which i thoroughly enjoyed. On the surface it looks just like another ecchi, harem series, but when you start peeling back the layers its really quite funny and endearing. If you watch this series, take it with agrain of salt, as the romance between the 2 mc's grows subtly.\\n\\n\r\nTBH the worst thing about this anime though, is the title. The title is so abrasive and vulgar that the only conclusions that i could come to about the show (based on title alone) were that the male mc was either a huge douchebag, or the female MC was a crazy, bitchy person. Neither of which is true. Crazy? Yes. Douchey/Bitchy? No.\\n\\n\r\nThis is just a great anime that serves as a great example of why you dont judge a book by its cover.",

            "content": "It was ok.\r\nStory: The story of My Girlfriend is a Sho-bitch isn't of a developed plot, like most animes. Instead, it introduces more characters and has events occur that allow for the development of characters. I have no problem with animes having stories like this, but the only thing I didn't like as much with this anime was the constant bombardment of sex jokes. For sex joke standards, they were creative, but the frequency should have been regulated to a good Aho Girl standard. The amount of jokes in there was at a nice and steady rate. This anime, though, was kinda like the lovechild of Shimoneta and Aho Girl. It worked in some aspects, but struggled in some others.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art in Sho-bitch was hit or miss, with some scenes looking pretty good and others seeming like they needed some extra detail. Some scenes had still frames, which confused me, since they could have animated some mouth movement. However, I do like the brighter colours that they used for this anime, and each character looks vibrant and much different from each other (spare Haruka and his sister). \\n\\n\r\nSound: If there is one thing that this anime did do pretty well, it's the sound. I didn't really care for the opening and ending as much as I would for other animes, but what caught my attention was the voice acting. I feel that the voices were expressive, and did capture the emotions at times. However, the only annoying part was the fact that the female voice actresses made erotic and sexual noises at least once every minute. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters in this anime were eh. You had a straight man, his \"harem\", a dude who could be gay, and a few other people. Overall, they all did have different personalities, but they all were only there to make sex jokes. I was fine with most characters, but the only one that stood out was Haruka as he didn't make sex jokes 24/7. He was the sole reason that this anime wasn't just sex jokes the entire time. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Although Sho-bitch feels like Aho Girl but with more sex jokes and less enjoyable characters, I did enjoy it a bit. I don't know if this is just because I'm drawn to bad things, but it did have moments that had me snickering instead of wondering why I was watching this anime. In my opinion, it was pretty enjoyable, and people like me probably would enjoy it too but for reasons different to when you'd like an anime that's good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Well, this anime was technically just meh for my \"normie watching standards\", but I did find it to have things that appealed to me \"cringe watcher\" side of myself. So, overall, if you enjoy things that are just ok, but also do have moments that could seem interesting to people such as myself, I'd say go for this anime, but don't go in expecting too much. Now, if you're a normie (like 95% of people here), I'd tell you to probably just stick with the meme compilations and not the entire anime\\n\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment 9 because i enjoy this stuff\\n\r\ndon't judge me",

            "content": "The 4-koma.  A simple yet pure comedic style that has recently been sullied due to the sheer amount of attempts to stretch the original source material into a full-length series.  While yes, it can work sometimes, this is certainly one example in which having full episodes turns the experience into something that's long and hard to watch.  Yes that was intentional.  \r\nStory:\r\nSho-bitch, as my shorthand for this series will be, centers (quite literally) itself around our main protagonist, Shinozaki Haruka.  One day he confesses to the school beauty, Kousaka Akiho, and instead of getting a straight answer from her, isasked what position he prefers.  Yep, it's that kind of series.  \\n\\n\r\nFor 10 episodes, Sho-bitch runs the gag of 'perverted innuendo comedy' into the ground ranging from attempted subtlety, to no subtlety, to just outright violating your mind with images of the sexual nature as its cast of hormone-filled teenagers bombard the screen with everything from imagery, to twisting words towards their own sexual fantasies, all with questionable motives when you step back and look at this from a 'non-comedic standpoint'.  The show pretty much only does one thing, and that one thing persists throughout the entire series thrusting its way into your memory so that you've submitted your fate to it and just go along with the flow anyway.  \\n\\n\r\nIn essence, the style is based around a 2 man comedy team where our main protagonist is the only straight man (and Kousaka's father, I guess) and everyone from his girlfriend to his childhood friend, and everyone in between reveals their sexual fantasy for any given situation so that everything becomes awkward for the MC, and you laugh.  Or supposed to.  While indeed comedy is subjective, Sho-bitch's presentation and execution for jokes is the same for the show's entire 10 episode runtime.  The result of this creates a stale presentation that goes from being mildly funny to kind of annoying.  But again, even that's on the individual, so, at your own risk.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Sho-bitch attempts to be a sweet and genuine romcom as the main couple of the series gradually gets used to dating to the point that they get to the 'I love you' phase (clearly the penultimate stage in any relationship) as the episodes run by, the sincerity of those words get vastly overshadowed by the show's naturally filthy nature and attempts to be funny from that normally filthy nature.  Perverted comedy is nothing new in anime (as Seitokai Yakuindomo will attest to that), but the lack of flair and the show's crudeness become its downfall because each episode makes the viewer more and more blas\u00e9 from seeing the same thing over and over again, making the viewing experience lackluster as a result.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Genuine relationship?  (Cause there is technically progression.)\\n\r\n+/- Just all perverted comedy \\n\r\n-  Pretty much one long running joke (It would be a 'on you, aka +/-', but in this case it hurts more than helps)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nTo solidify the show as a series devoted to innuendos (which really aren't innuendos by the end of it), the characters for the most part exemplify a specific...theme to add some 'variety' to the cast and make the joke 'varied', even if that doesn't help much since the presentation is all the same.\\n\\n\r\nNow Shinozaki Haruka is the series's straight man.  No question about it, and he is honestly not that interesting.  His personality stems from him acting as the series's straight man and preventing whatever is happening now from going any further because if this cast was let loose into the world without any control, we would have a massive case of sexual assault on our hands.  Regardless, aside from that, he tries to be a good boyfriend and learns to try and be one for his new girlfriend despite her insinuating many a perverted thing because...I guess she's thirsty or something.  She's not really, but I guess we're supposed to get that impression.  All this leaves his personality to be stagnant because rather than really develop his character and give him more traits, he's stuck being the boring babysitter for the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nAnd...now for the rest of the cast.  To be honest, pretty much everyone else worth mentioning in this series falls into the category of 'specializing' in a particular style of perverted joke.  So here's them in a lightning round:\\n\\n\r\nKousaka Akiho: All-rounder.  Makes any kind of jokes but shows some genuineness from trying to be a good girlfriend.\\n\r\nAriyama Shizuku: Childhood friend that likes making jokes but can't take any herself.  May or may not have a crush on the MC (not confirmed) and has a bust complex.\\n\r\nShinozaki Kanata: Imouto who always wears something cat-like and insinuates stuff, but doesn't actually know the meaning half the time.\\n\r\nSaijou Rina: Oujosama-like girl who is basically a sexual predator for girls.  \\n\r\nHoshikawa Seiya: Comes in very late, but makes a splash due to an omnipresent 'yaoi hand' and appreciation for shafts in his hole.  \\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on, but this should give a rough estimate as to what we're dealing with her.  Characters with smaller appearances do follow this trend, so that isn't the end of what Sho-bitch has to offer.  Does this make the cast interesting?  Well, kind of.  Again, while the presentation is the same, the content at lest differs from person to person.  Is this a good thing?  Well...no.  They're all super one-note as far as I'm aware.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Variety?\\n\r\n-  One-note cast across the board.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by a collaboration of Diomedia and Studio Blanc, Shobitch is...not very pleasing to look at.  Aside from the violating amount of imagery (and clothing choices) from your everyday dick joke to pantsu and everything being covered in white liquid which in and itself can turn away a large part of the show's potential audience, the one thing the art lacks is consistency.\\n\\n\r\nVery often character frames from one scene to another, even key frames from ones side by side to each other don't look right.  Proportions and things like placement of the eyes, size of the head, etc all beg the kind of quality control that came about during production, and as such, create a very unappealing piece to look at.  Colors are also quite blinding and don't have any variety or contrast to it having this very saturated color scheme persisting throughout the show's runtime.  I know Studio Blanc doesn't exactly have many anime under its belt, but Diomedia at least has a half-decent team working under it so that this shouldn't be THAT much of a problem.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Lots and lots of perverted imagery\\n\r\n-  Vastly inconsistent art\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n'Eien Labyrinth' sung by Aoi Yuuki herself poses a weirdly high standard for the show's soundtrack.  Her performance contrasts her role as Kousaka who ordinarily has a lower tone to her voice to compliment her 'kuudere-like' appearance by showing off her higher range.  Oh, and the song's pretty good.  Personally, I wouldn't say it's anything worth listening to again, as it doesn't have that 'memorability' factor that I tend to look for in a show's OST, but it's by no means a bad track.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the show's ED, \"Koi no Himitsu\" by pua:re (who's basically a group of a bunch of the show's female seiyuus singing together), bears a more energetic tone that similar to its OP counterpart, is not terrible to listen to, but not that memorable all things considered.  I suppose the show's budget all went to the music rather than the art.  So I guess...that's a thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent tracks\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who read the original manga, this show at least from a visual standpoint...disappointed me.  Story-wise, it's about what I expected.  Since it was based on a 4-koma series, I didn't really expect it to be anything spectacular.  But each episode still gave me that sinking feeling of realizing \"Oh we're doing this now\" as scenes that I uncomfortably recalled from the source material were being replicated in the anime.  If the quality of the art had been up to what Diomedia's standards for art usually are, then I would've given this show the pass of meeting expectations so it's not great, but not terrible. But since the lack of consistency made the visual experience lackluster, I unfortunately have to dock it a couple points for that reason.  I have this joke theory that getting Aoi Yuuki to voice the female protagonist and do a song for the show took so much out of the budget that they had nothing left for barely anything due to her popularity.  I'd be amusing to think if that's the reason why the show's quality is below average.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nSho-bitch for me is kind of obligatory at this point.  It's not one of those series I look forward to, but when it's there I kinda just go \"Oh, its this one again.\"  So it doesn't really elicit a response.  I will say that out of the entire cast, Kanata is my favorite of the bunch.  Personally, I just find her cute and vaguely amused that everything she wears on her head has to have cat ears.  Because why not.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nI'd be remised to say that the comedy definitely got uncomfortable at times, but I was more annoyed by the lack of art consistency more than anything.  Sure the original art isn't great, but when you make Kousaka's eyes go even more further apart than they already are, then there's a problem.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nEven if you're a fan of perverted comedy...watch at your own risk.  The show itself adheres to the lowest common denominator, and it's pretty self-aware about it.  Despite that though, it's not really something that's worth putting on your list because the time could be used for other things.  Personally, I would've cut the runtime of each episode in half so that the series is presented more as a short since for snappy situational comedy, that format tends to do better for this kind of show.  All in all, Shobitch is a below average school romcom perverted comedy that has been done better so unless you're really interested in what these 10 episodes have inside them, I would best stay away from it.",

Unfortunately this show is average at best in a lot of departments. The main draw of the show in my opinion is it's comedy in which sex jokes are utilized. Even then, it takes until the mid-point of the series for the comedy to really get good, prior to which everything felt a little bland.\r\nThere is no meaningful story to be found here and the romance between two of the main characters Haruka Shinozaki and Akiho Kousaka is just there to mainlyfacilitate the comedy.\\n\r\nThe art style was good and I thought that the ecchi scenes were well done and complimented the humor very nicely. The OST in itself is average at best however the use of soundtrack to enhance certain moments has to be noted. Also the great use of the sound effects went a long way in making the dirty jokes as funny as they are.\\n\r\nThe two main characters of the show are for the most part uninteresting and this is the reason why a lot of the first half of the show felt bland to me. The show really benefits from a cast of funny side characters that ultimately makes Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken worth the watch. Some examples of my favorite side characters would be Seiya Hoshikawa and Sayo Shizumori.\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of crude humor, then you might be able to get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this show.

            "content": "Ohhh Ho ho ho...Seitokai Yakuindomo this is not...but it's trying?\r\nBoku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken for LA is as a sex comedy \"romcom\" as a surefire hit or miss series especially with it's level of humor it always gives off.\r\nBoku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken is what happens when Okusama ga Seitokaichou! perverted romance tries to shove itself into Seitokai Yakuindomo and trying to put these two together and flimsily bring up any chance of a phallic or sex joke whenever possible. Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken is essentially about Haruka Shinozaki voiced by Mitsuhiro Ichiki confesses toAkiho Kousaka voiced by Aoi Yuuki, that's it...ohhh and add some harem antics with different girls with their own *ahem* fetishes and sex jokes. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, since LA had been conditioned by Seitokai Yakuindomo and loving many of their unpredictable sex jokes, Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken is a hit or miss comedy for LA merely because for the majority of the anime LA CAN SEE THE JOKES COMING and the punchlines are played straight so there's nothing LA has seen from Seitokai Yakuindomo and that did better, but it becomes a hit for the rare times the punchlines either crosses the line thrice or really did come out of nowhere that LA just had to laugh, yes, LA did laugh a few times in this anime, so Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken DID do something right at times.\\n\\n\r\nSo uhhh is there a problem?, well it's to do with Haruka and Akiho's relationship and how the sex comedy is literally in the way of their own relationship, sure it's a sex romcom and everything, it's more comedy than romance but LA JUST KNEW where this anime would be going and that would be...not that much and it's just even worse due to the other main characters of Shizuku Ariyama, Miki Aikawa, Saori Igarashi, Rina Saijou, Kanata (who's Haruka's little sister....yes they go that way), Sayo Shizumori and Seiya Hosikawa lumped in, the \"relationship\" is highly taken seriously. To which LA sees Sayo and Seiya's skits are base annoying, Sayo for her voyeurism fetish 24/7 and Seiya for being the typical gay archetype and being extremely blatant about it. The only interesting characters besides the main cast would be probably Akiho's parents Natsuo and Fuyumi who are essentially the future interpretations of Haruka and Akiho with expected results. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Diomedea and Studio Blanc is average at best at how inconsistent it is. The character designs are decent enough and how moe they look but at times the animation degrades in quality which shows up quite often and this is for a sex romcom, shouldn't this have consistent quality?..LA doesn't know, maybe there was a miscommunication between Diomedea and Blanc which caused all this. The animation is overall inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting however is one of the only elements in Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken where LA can see any sense of strength. Aoi Yuuki is probably the best voice actor and that is because she steamrolls any of the newbie voice actors due to her even being a veteran and well known voice actor. Juri Nagatsuma who voices Saori is actually pretty decent in her reactions for the majority of her skits as well as Rarisa Takeda Tago who voiced Shizuku for similar reasons. The reason why LA says the voice acting is a major strength to Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken is merely because of HOW the voice cast knows their timing and reactions of many of the sex jokes land and alot of them land oddly enough.\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken \"tries\" and LA says that loosely in being a sex romcom but is stifled by it's harem antics which LA sees as unneeded which compounded by a hit or miss comedy makes this anime rather subpar in comparison to Seitokai Yakuindomo's brilliantly executed sex jokes. Does Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken utterly suck at it's comedy, well no, does it need to?, no. As long as it even manages to make you laugh in any sense for LA, it did it's job, it doesn't need to be Seitokai Yakuindomo as much as LA compared to it many times.\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken IS NOT Seitokai Yakuindomo but it tries in it's own way of being a sex romcom and it stumbles but at times it picks itself up and crosses that line....that sex-riddled line for a laugh AND IT WORKS.",
