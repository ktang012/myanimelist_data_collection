            "content": "Oh dear Shingeki no Kyojin, where do I even begin. If you've talked with your friends about anime, then the couple anime that everyone talks about are Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and... Shingeki no Kyojin. What's the difference between Shingeki and the rest? Shingeki only has 25 episodes so far yet it's on par in popularity with the other super long, Americanized anime. Why is it popular? Well that's simply because it's stunningly amazing. Those people that call Shingeki no Kyojin \"overrated\" may not have the same taste as me, and that's perfectly fine, but in my honest opinion, Shingeki no Kyojin isone of if not the greatest anime to be made. It's not popular for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is one of the most captivating stories I've ever seen. 100 years prior to the start of the anime, humanity has been on the bridge of extinction due to the monstrous humanoid Titans that devour humans. Now, present day in the anime, the remaining small population of mankind lives confined within 3 \"heavenly\" walls that are so tall and sturdy that even the titans can't break in. The most outward wall was named, Wall Maria, the middle wall was named Wall Rose, and the most outward wall named Wall Sina. Unfortunately for mankind, a colossal titan, one that is even bigger than the 50 meter heavenly walls, breaks Wall Maria, allowing the other titans to rampage the city, thus leading to another massacre of mankind. During this massacre, our main characters, Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman watch in horror as a horrifying titan rips their mother's head off, then gobbles her up whole. Vowing that he'd one day avenge mankind and exterminate all the titans, Eren Yeager trains to become a survey corp, brave heroic soldiers who go outside the walls, into the plains in order to fight the titans. But we soon find out, that Eren is much more special than he seems, not only is he a brave warrior, but he's also something else that could be the key to humanity's survival, but could also be humanity's destruction. \\n\\n\r\nMy 3-word thoughts on the anime: Epic, Dynamic, Masterpiece. The suspense build-up was absolutely amazing, yet there was still room for improvement; that shows just how epic this anime can get. The anime not only includes epic fights, but lots of dialogue, and for those of you that hate dialogue, I feel sorry for you people whom only watch for action. The anime includes lots of other things as well: there's lots of half-hearted, hilarious scenes, as well as sad, tragic scenes. The anime certainly has a good amount of gore, and will break your heart frequently (if you get attached to the characters). Many characters end up getting gobbled up mercilessly while trying to protect humanity in ways that are quite *shivers*. Have I teared up in the anime? As a matter of fact, I have. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters was another area (alongside every area) that was Shingeki's strongpoint. There's a diverse variety of characters that fight for humanity for all different reasons. There's trust, friendship, along with betrayals, and pains. There's comedy relief among many characters, especially Sasha \"Potato Girl\" Blouse. There are characters that people can definitely relate with, such as Armin Arlert, who wants to do the right thing and protect his friends, but can't seem to do much because of fear. Fear is something that haunts us all, and prevents us from doing things in life. Another character that people can somewhat relate with is Annie Leonhardt, who fights alongside humanity, yet fights opposed to humanity. What does that mean? Watch the anime. Why is she doing this? Because of her past scars, \"scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real\" (watch to find out more). There were too many characters to development fully, but certainly the main characters were developed to their max. Levi is certainly a fan-favorite character, because of the fact that he's cool, overpowered, badass, kind-in-the-heart, smart, straight-to-the-point, and most of all, hilarious with all his neat-freakiness. The main character, Eren Yeager is strong-hearted, and \"special\", but he's still not strong enough to defeat the titans. How he develops is one of the most interesting things, in this interesting-things-packed anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and music can be described in one word: WOW! The art drawings were absolutely stunning! From the characters/titans to the setting of the story to all the equipment used in battle. The characters all had a unique aspect to them. The settings of the anime were beautiful. The cities, and walls looked realistic, the plains that characters dreamed of seeing made me want to run outside to see for myself how beautiful nature really is, and how humans under appreciate the naturality of nature. The 3-D gear was something that really caught my eye, and will certainly catch other people's eyes as well. A new form of action that's never been seen before. The characters would literally fly from rooftop to rooftop slicing their swords at the titans at high-speeds that keep the viewers eyes locked onto the screen at all times. The soundtrack in the anime was epic as shit. The openings speak for themselves, they do the anime justice. The openings were epic and certainly set the mood of what was to come from the anime. \"They're the prey, and we are the hunters!\" The rest of the soundtrack in the anime was okayasgduyasgda AMAZING. How can one describe how amazing those German OSTs were. They fit in perfectly with the epicness of the anime, and certianly added tons of suspense to the 3-D maneuver gear action. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, I may be over-thinking things, but the anime certainly included some themes while creating this masterpiece of an anime. The aspect of being confined in an area, doing the same daily routine every day. People seek to be free, and to seek adventure. Watch for this. Another theme that the anime incorporated was that of the cycle of life. Humans, we steal animals away from their families, we kill them, we eat them. What's so different from us, and the titans? The feelings of not being at the top of the food chain... Anyways, if you haven't already watched this anime and you're reading this review, then you've clearly been living under a rock all this time, and I definitely encourage you to watch this show even if it isn't your style of anime.",

            "content": "I started to follow the manga after watching the anime and quite frankly I don't see where and how the plot of Shingeki no Kyojin can suck, which in my humble opinion is awsome. You can understand the anime very well even without having read the manga. However, SNK isn't understood by many because it's a psychological manga .. SNK isn't just a succession of empty and meaningless clashes and, of uncontrolled violence, stereotyped heroes who fight the bad (like Bleach). Here are shown the darkest sides of the human psyche with great mastery: the desire to be the best but can't do it, thedifference between men, their different modes of action (just think about the speech when Eren was discovered in which they show the reactions of the inhabitants of the inner walls Rose) and their motivations, some of the questionable actions that seems to be made in the right and instead the Justice of others that superficially seems foolish and petty (such as the choice of sending refugees to rebuild the wall Mary), freedom and the fact that they don't understand that what others inculcate to us sometimes are nothing more than mental cages. We stop at the appearances only because it suits us ( the walls is a symbol of that). Omitting the main and masterfully developed theme of \"Homo omini lupus\".\\n\r\nIn this anime there are no heroes! There are not brave men, without fear, that kill all the wicked. Here there are people who are fighting against their own fear and that sometimes they make it and sometimes not. The enemies aren't the giants !Although the anime does not say from where they come from and I won't do spoilers, it's repeated several times that the enemies are the human beings with their fear (who have surrendered to the giants without doing anything, ignoring and accepting to live like cattle) and the walls! But no one notices that because it would be too challenging to make two questions and wondering: \"Why the walls ? Shouldn't they be their salvation?\" and get an answer.\\n\r\nThe fact that many people aren't well characterized, and that physically are not very different from each other isn't a coincidence .. Isayama is putting on the same level all human beings, he is saying that we are all like that guy who shoots himself alone after he surrendered to fear, that we are all as Vernam (who during the attack fled from Trost ), that there is some of us who is better than others, but that we all live under the same fears, and even if we react differently, we act according to substantially the same nature. It still tells us that we might be the protagonists of our life, choosing our destiny, but only if we are ready to go beyond the stereotypes and mindsets that others impose to us, only if only if we work with all our strength. Because living by what others tell us, from what they show us, isn't to live, but survive!\\n\r\nAnd in addition to all the various points of reflection that SNK has to offer (and there are many, not just those listed ), there is a plot full of twists and turns, the suspense. In short, it is a masterpiece. \\n\r\nThen, if you are used to an anime where the bad guys magically becomes good after a lesson or in which the characters acquire super powers from nothing or from old men who appearing in their minds... Well, ok ...... that ... that's original and profound ........\\n\r\n(Hope my english was not so bad) :)",

            "content": "In the 80's, Mobile Suit Gundam catapulted anime in Japan.\r\nIn the 90s, Dragon Ball Z broke the mainstream walls while Neon Genesis Evangelion opened the doors to the now indispensable late-night anime slots in Japan.\r\nIn the 2000s, Fullmetal Alchemist marked the peak of manga-to-anime adaptations while Code Geass & Death Note headed the class of those who introduced the new anti-hero genre.\r\nAnd now, in 2013, Attack on Titan has shaken the industry once again.\r\nUnless you've been living under a rock for the past 5 months, you should at least know what the story is about, and for the sake of staying spoiler free, I'm notgoing into details on the plot.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I wrote this review, I wrote a different piece moments after watching the first episode stating that Attack on Titan had all the potential to become a landmark anime, knowing very little of how true that statement would turn out to be.\\n\\n\r\nI have watched anime ever since I can remember. I have seen the very best and the worst that this industry has to offer. And I, like most of you, am very familiar with the relationship of manga-anime adaptation, which is the case of Attack on Titan. It is because of such experience and knowledge that I am able to say with so much confidence that Attack on Titan is the best anime series ever produced from any standpoint, at least, in the last decade.\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan is such a well-done product that it has all the key strong points we all dream every series could have. By this I mean the story, characters, animation, OST, opening/ending sequences, art, directing, narrative, character development, and, most importantly, the \"it\" factor. These are all present with \"A grade\" production values. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I want to start with the OST. Simply put, Attack on Titan's soundtrack rivals that of Rurouni Kenshin and Evangelion. Period. Don't misunderstand, they are not similar by any means, they are simply equally as masterful. Check on the internet the impressions left by fans about the first soundtrack. And if you still don't believe me, tweet Hideo Kojima (creator of Metal Gear series) and ask his take on it.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is extremely important in this show because it allows you to feel the many epic moments that dwell in this 25 episode marvel. This is where the directing and narrative play a big role. For those of you who have seen Death Note (same director), you will feel an extra feeling of similarity with Attack on Titan, as the show relies heavily on its intense emotional scenes which you most certainly will feel the first 2 minutes of episode #1. \\n\\n\r\nIt is in these scenes where the golden cast of characters shine. I cannot stress enough how unique the characters are. You could say they are the cream of the many accolades that Attack on Titan has. I'm still amazed by the quality of voice actors that just seem to just pop out in this show. The voices of so many main characters from hit series come together in Attack on Titan to help provide that epic feeling you start to get once episode #1 ends. Note I emphasize the voice acting because it's part of the anime but, obviously, not of the manga. \\n\\n\r\nAnother key strong point is the work and effort put on the OP/ED sequences. If you've come this far in my review then you most likely understand when I say that Openings and Ending sequences are crucial. They provide that extra excitement to the show. It's definitely something not all anime series take seriously. Fortunately, Wit Studio took them seriously, and then came \"Guren no Yumiya\". The second opening, \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa\" is outstanding and marvelous in its own way and the second ending, \"great escape\", fuels that adrenaline rush of excitement you will get after those killing cliffhangers. Having said that, the first OP, \"Guren no Yumiya\", is simply epic. If there was ever something to describe as epic, it would be this OP. I am certain that as of today, it is the greatest anime opening ever. I'm amazed by the amount of attention it got on the internet and the hundreds of parodies derived from it. It was simply a treat to our eyes. The song. The animation in the opening. The sync between the two. Epic. \\n\\n\r\nYou won't be skipping that opening.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, an animation production is never as close to perfection without the animation and art being top class. Now, Attack on Titan has astonishing art, to the point where you are amazed of how far animation has come. The scenes where there is sunlight will leave you speechless. The animation, unlike the other aspects, is where some disagree. The only thing I have to say is I was extremely impressed throughout the whole show until I saw a certain scene in episode #11 where the 3D maneuver gear was used, and I was stunned. I was simply stunned. Then, of course, later episodes also take it to a whole new level, but you're probably gonna be used to that quality of greatness by then.\\n\\n\r\nThat's how ridiculously good Attack on Titan is.\\n\\n\r\nNow, like the characters, the story is mostly work of the manga's author. This includes character development, which I believe is the key to the success and extreme popularity of the characters. Also, the story maybe the most original aspect of this series. Nothing you have seen before is in this show. Nothing. Much like EVA, Attack on Titan gives you a world of \"dystopia\", on-edge, and uncertainty, so full of potential that just when you think you have it figured it out, it turns around and leaves you speechless. \\n\\n\r\nOh, that will happen to you for the first time in episode #5. Guaranteed. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, even IF all these characteristics of an anime series are top notch, it won't amount to its potential if it doesn't have that \"IT\" factor. Some series have the \"IT\" factor without having all of these production values. They tend have 3 or 4 at most. Those become popular because they give out that feeling of \"amazing\". Gintama, the greatest gag series ever, comes to mind. Its anime doesn't have overwhelming OST, or eye popping animation; it does have A class characters and A class story (among others), but that \"IT\" factor takes it to another level. Now, imagine having practically everything an anime series has to offer in A class value while also having that \"IT\" factor. Extremely rare. Eva rare. FMA rare. Attack on Titan is part of that elite group. This is why its popularity rose to highs only few series reach.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first time I have ever written a detailed review of an anime series. I did it because this one deserves it. It's The anime series of my adult era. I can now relate to those anime fans who watched Evangelion almost 20 years ago. They knew they had something special, just like we do now with Attack on Titan. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Attack on Titan is, of course, like MS Gundam, DBZ, EVA, FMA, Geass, and Death Note, not perfect. Like any other piece of greatness it does have its negatives. Having said that, when you add up the good and the bad, you end up with a landmark anime series that is currently shaking the industry with its mesmerizing, sensational, emotional, intense, and inspiring first season. Just imagine the wait and the hype for season 2. \\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of effect will Attack on Titan have on the anime/manga industry we love? Only time will tell...\\n\\n\r\nIn the meantime, this is simply the best anime series in the last 15 years. Enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nExquisite beyond words.\\n\r\n101/100.",

            "content": "Every once in a while, and even more frequently now than in the past, an anime appears that is completely and unequivocally shrouded in layers upon layers of hype and popularity from the anime community. It's the show that's on everyone lips, as well as everyone's TV screens. In the Fall of 2011, The Future Diary created an exceptional level of hype that had not been seen for quite some time. When the Summer of 2012 rolled along, it was time for Sword Art Online to take the spotlight, and its own popularity grew toheights far beyond that of The Future Diary. Then, in the Spring of 2013, we were treated to what one could consider the Game of Thrones or the Breaking Bad of the anime industry in terms of sheer popularity; a show that completed engulfed the entire anime community, dwarfing even SAO in popularity, but is this anime truly worthy of the hype that it received?\\n\\n\r\n          Our story is set in an alternate universe where, 100 years prior to the events of the story, giant humanoid creatures known as Titans appeared and began consuming and decimating the human population, though with no apparent purpose for doing so. In response, the remainder of humanity built three enormous, circular walls to encompass their entire population and keep the Titans at bay. In this world, we meet three young children Eren Yeager, his adopted sister Mikasa, and their friend Armin, as they live out their peaceful lives in the southernmost city at the edge of the outer wall, Wall Maria. This soon changes, however, when a 60-meter Titan smashes through the main gate of Wall Maria, allowing Titans to freely enter the city and devour every human in sight, and forcing those who lived in the outer districts to retreat behind Wall Rose. During the chaos, Eren witnesses his mother being eaten by a Titan, and now he, Mikasa, and Armin have joined the military in the hopes of acquiring the skills necessary to take vengeance on the creatures that destroyed their lives.\\n\\n\r\n          This series, as a whole, has almost completely mastered the art of building suspense, mostly through the use of very long plot arcs. There always seems to be something constantly pushing towards a conclusion, but not actually getting there until several episode later, and that push factor creates a sensation of rarely ever wanting to stop watching for fear of the resolution being just after the episode you just watched. Additionally, this series is also a master of what I call the \"morale builder,\" something that Gurren Lagann has shown mastery of in the past, and there are dozens of moments throughout the series where, no matter how grim and horrifying the situation, it provides an uplifting or rallying feeling that both immerses you in the world its sets up and makes you root for our heroes to the bitter end.\\n\\n\r\n          Speaking of grim and horrifying, that comparison to Game of Thrones earlier was far from being an off-handed comment. By this I mean that I hope you don't enjoy getting attached to characters, like I do, as you may find yourself curled up in a corner at some point. In the world of fiction, particularly in action series, there is a concept called \"plot armor,\" which basically means that characters who seem crucial to the plot's progression and the show's stability as a whole are protected from death or other nasty fates that might await them. In this regard, the plot armor for Attack on Titan is about as thick as a used piece of tin foil, and deaths of major characters are frequent and often times unrelenting. In regards to this, and on a more personal note, there are only three anime that have actually made me legitimately cry before. Two of them were KyoAni series, and the third was Attack on Titan. This show really does not care about who your favorite character is, and if you've made it this far without having had the major deaths in the series spoiled for you yet, then consider yourself lucky.\\n\\n\r\n          Unfortunately, there is one minor flaw with this series. There are certain points, especially at some slightly slower moments in the series, where its gets a little too over-dramatic, to the point of almost being ridiculous. This was especially noticeable during what is now referred to as the \"Boulder Arc,\" which encompasses roughly episodes 10-12. These moments are few and far between however, and are immediately drowned out once the hype builds back up again.\\n\\n\r\n          On the character front, for the sake of not getting your hopes up about the prospects of certain characters living, I'll talk only about the three main characters I mentioned earlier, with the knowledge that the rest of the cast, while incredibly massive in scale, still serves as a stellar group of vibrant personalities and ideals to create a surprisingly organic social environment. As for the big three, we'll start with Armin, who takes on the \"smart one/strategist\" archetype. While he is fairly generic and standard at the beginning of the series, we get to see him grow into being a more varied character at a constantly shifting rate, and his skills at strategy both on the battlefield and in complex conversations are practically unmatched, often allowing him the power to save the other two from the situations they get themselves into.\\n\\n\r\n          Next is Mikasa, who, for the majority of the series, is portrayed as being essentially flawless, taking on the role of the unstoppable badass Titan slayer fresh out of training who also makes time to coddle her adoptive brother, and this flawlessness is built up to the point of it almost being a flaw in itself. There are, however, a few quirks to her personality that make her feel more human, but at the same time make her seem even more distant. Her only notable \"flaw\" seems to be her undying loyalty and devotion to Eren, often throwing caution to the wind and bolting out against orders in order to make sure he's safe. This also leads to some rather disquieting moments where her own sanity seems to abandon her and, to put it lightly, causes her to act excessively hostile towards anyone who means ill will towards Eren.\\n\\n\r\n          Finally, we have Eren, our stereotypical \"perseverance\" character whose sole motivation for the majority of the season is taking revenge on the Titans, and while this does seem like a bit of a gaping flaw for the show's main character, it's actually both understandable and sort of refreshing. His intense focus on his own rage and desires for revenge slowly consumes part of who he is, which becomes especially present at several points throughout the series that I can't go further into detail on due to massive amounts of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\n         The animation was produced by Wit Studios, a new studio that serves as a surrogate of Production I.G. Regardless of its heritage, for a new studio to create such a massively impressive project is beyond incredible. Not only is the animation well-polished, but it also carries its own distinctive style, most notably in the fact that its characters are heavily outlined in varying thicknesses of black to make them pop out from the background. Speaking of backgrounds, the environments are shown to be incredibly rich and detailed despite how unvaried they may appear on the surface, and the action shots give us plenty of different perspectives on this environment. As for the action itself, Wit Studios has no qualms at all with handing out incredible fight sequences by the barrel-full via an in-world tool used by humanity's military known as 3D Maneuver Gear, allowing us to break away from standard ground combat and enter the world of high-flying intensity, with soldiers bolting off of every building in sight, into the air above them, and landing blade-first on the neck of a Titan. On course, all of these brilliant combinations of animation are to be expected from Araki, who has already brought us both the intensely stylized atmosphere of Death Note and the blood-pumping action of Guilty Crown.\\n\\n\r\n         The dub was produced by FUNimation, and, as someone who watched the subbed version first, I have no problems whatsoever recommending this dub. From heavy-hitting new favorites like Josh Grelle and Matthew Mercer to classic icons like Vic Mignogna and Caitlin Glass, Funimation has pulled out all the stop to create one of the best dubs this side of 2010. Grelle shuffles between nervously unstable and frantically stern for his portrayal as Armin, and Trina Nishimura pulls off both Mikasa's warmth and ferocity to near perfection. My only notable flaw with the dub is Bryce Papenbrook as Eren. To be fair, this is definitely Papenbrook's best performance yet, due in no small part to Mike McFarland's exceptional voice directing, but he does still tend to get a bit \"Bryce-y\" at some points and lets his excessively angsty style boil over, which is a rather dangerous idea considering Eren's character. Overall though, this is a minor blemish on an otherwise excellent dub.\\n\\n\r\n         The music was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano (Aldnoah.Zero, Kill la Kill), and this soundtrack is definitely one of the best to come out of anime in a long time, based in heavy orchestrations and laced throughout with electronica and hard rock. From the bombastic explosions of \"E.M.A\" and main theme \"Attack on Titan\" to the insert tracks of \"The Reluctant Heroes\" and \"Doa,\" this soundtrack dabbles in the art of perfection on all fronts. If it seems like I'm being much more in-depth with the soundtrack than usual, it's because I've actually purchased the soundtrack on iTunes and have been listening to it practically non-stop, and I highly recommend making this purchase as well. Both opening themes, \"Guren no Yumiya\" and \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa,\" were performed by Linked Horizon and give us massive eruptions of heavy rock combined with brass and vocal choirs (and on a quick aside, I'm one of the few people that actually preferred the second theme more than the first, though the first still kicks all sorts of ass). The first ending theme \"Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai\" by Yoko Hikasa gives us a rolling ballad to play us out of each episode, while the second ending theme \"great escape\" by Cinema Staff blasts through with a heavy rock track. Additionally, all of these tracks except \"great escape\" are available for purchase on iTunes, purchases that I also highly recommend.\\n\\n\r\n         Overall, Attack on Titan is simply an incredible experience, combining high-flying action that could even make ufotable nervous with a dark and nearly-overwhelming sense of fear and desperation, and this anime is more than deserving of the hype that it receives. However, as it stands right now, on November 4, 2014, the series is incomplete, and there has been no announcement of a second season yet. I highly doubt that this second season will never come however, and it has been reported that the original manga is planned to be finished in about four years\u2019 time (which actually isn't that much material for a monthly manga). In the meantime, there will be plenty of specials and spin-offs to keep us satiated until season 2 is officially announced.\\n\\n\r\n          Attack on Titan is currently licensed by FUNimation and is available from them for both streaming and purchase.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin... Where do I start?\r\nIn summary, Shingeki no Kyojin is a perfect anime to get somebody who loves action started on anime- I think it is literally the most mainstream anime ever made, and that is definitely not a bad thing. But with this comes downsides- ones not apparent to the viewer at first glance, but looking back on it after watching it around the time it first came out, definitely shine through.\r\nShingeki no Kyojin starts off with a roar- the first 2 episodes explode right out of the gate with high-octane action that also leaves mystery to draw the viewer in. Whoare the titans? What is in the basement? Why is Eren's dad so creepy? All this and more the viewer asks themselves as the end credits roll for episode 2.\\n\\n\r\nThen episode 3 and 4 jump in. It's a training scene for Eren and his friends, and it's dead slow in comparison. But that's ok- it's episodes like this that reinforce character development and get the plot rolling. And soon, the episodes with action will begin again, right? That High-Octane, bloody, gory action we've all been waiting for!\\n\\n\r\nWell, it does. But then shortly after, it grinds back to a halt. Why do I bring up the first 5 episodes out of all things to mention about Shingeki no Kyojin? Because it perfectly frames the pacing of the entire anime. First you're baited with that sweet, bloody action that makes you just stare at the screen in amazement of the beautiful animation and heart-pumping soundtrack, and next thing you know you have to sit through an hour of people arguing over the same issue over and over before going back to the action. This would be fine and acceptable if it actually resulted in plot and character development going somewhere- but rarely this bickering between Armin and Eren result in anything productive.\\n\\n\r\nActually, Shingeki no Kyojin seems to show perfectly how to pull off the ILLUSION of plot and character development- Eren struggling with his inner demons despite somehow going back to square 1 every 5 episodes, the Basement which has been explicitly mentioned as having \"all the answers\" being completely forgotten about while the group goes out to hunt titans, and Armin rehashing what we already know to other characters every episode or two. All of this combined create a huge mess that on first glance seems like a deep and interesting story, but only through reflection of a different lens you begin to notice how shallow the pool you're standing in really is. The characters are shallow, the story tries to go somewhere but the characters almost seem to prevent it from moving at all, and at some points the story tries to go to too many places at once, just confusing the viewer until the next trippy action scene kicks in.\\n\\n\r\nI like to compare Shingeki no Kyojin to a Michael Bay film. This also makes it easier to understand what I'm trying to say (and trust me, it's not your fault- I have a hard time expressing what I feel in words sometimes).\\n\\n\r\nImagine Eren as Shia Labeouf, and Shingeki no Kyojin as a typical summer blockbuster by Michael Bay. Eren zips around the scenes of the movie, fighting bad-guys and pulling off amazing stunts with beautifully rendered graphics and an amazing ost- but then hardcut to Eren getting mad at himself and people around him but not actually advancing the plot for 1/3rd of the movie as the action grinds to a halt. Add some comedic relief (if you want a Bay comparison, the classic transformers out of place masturbation joke fits well) including possibly some potatoes after a traumatic scene and then slap on the illusion of having a deep plot and you have Shingeki no Kyojin. It's a typical summer blockbuster! You go in, watch it, enjoy it, then leave and forget about it! I'm really not saying you're not allowed to enjoy it because it's shallow and noisy, I'm just saying you shouldn't walk in expecting a revolutionary masterpiece of anime- which is what some critics are raising it up to be.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY- 4 : The story's foundations are put up well, but the actual progression falls flat as no questions are ever really answered and the plot never seems to want to go in a single direction.\\n\r\nART- 9 : The art is amazing! There are some worse-off scenes and some animation glitches, but the art is one of the things that makes Shingeki no Kyojin stand out from the crowd. Even though I am not a huge fan of the anime itself, I have a massive poster above my computer of it as we speak.\\n\r\nSOUND- 10 : While the music and sound design is generic at worst, it is composed beautifully and always reinforces the mood set out by the show. I would highly recommend a download of the OST.\\n\r\nCHARACTER- 3 : Easily the worst part of Shingeki no Kyojin. Eren's constant back and forth attitude and behaviour that never goes anywhere, Armin's arguing with people that last an entire episode simply to recap what just happened on screen, Mikasa's constant fight to try and save everyone and pull everything together: it's just all poorly done.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- 6 : While watching Shingeki no Kyojin, I certainly enjoyed it- but I wouldn't say I enjoyed it the whole way through. Even while watching it, I noticed a lot of the fighting and arguing was going on too long, and let's not forget the 3-5 episodes of riding on horses. But the scenes that were enjoyable- notably the fight scenes and the pivotal plot twists certainly left a lot to talk about and were enjoyable enough to at least somewhat wipe away two annoying characters yelling at eachother on horses for 30 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 5: Watch it, get what you get out of it, but don't walk in expecting the next amazing revolutionary anime. Expect a summer blockbuster.",

            "content": "Attack on Titan is a particularly unique case for me. As such, my review needs to be broken up to properly analyze it. \r\nStory: \r\nAttack on Titan has an absolutely astounding setting. The sheer idea behind the setting, the exposition pieces, and the initial plot elements held the potential for it to be one of the best action anime ever. From the first three episodes, I could see how someone could believe this would be that one anime that is just absolutely amazing. It simply becomes disappointing as things continue. Long story short? The start is absolutely amazing. It's powerful. It's grabbing. It does everythingan introduction should do. The problem after that stems from the plot slowly becoming painfully predictable and a personal dissatisfaction with the protagonists in place as well as the decisions of various members of the cast completely destroying the story's credibility at times. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nArt is completely subjective. I would not actually judge art based on someone's own opinion. You would really have to see it for yourself to deem whether it is \"good\" or not. As for me, it seemed fairly mediocre. The effort is there, but something with the art style simply does not jive with me. The settings are well done, but the characters are quite bland. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nFinally. This is what I can praise Attack on Titan for. If anything, this series's soundtrack deserves to be remembered. It is excellent and its execution throughout the anime was not only strategic but tasteful. The tracks range from dark and depressing to powerful and moving pieces designed for a battle against a completely hopeless situation. In my opinion, the music in and of itself is the true beauty behind this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist Eren Jeager is heavily set on his goal to a fault. Some call this good writing, but given the setting, it actually works against the story and its credibility. It is literally almost difficult to not find the main character's obsession with revenge nostalgic and downright hilarious. If you don't like avenger-type characters, you will despise Eren beyond imagination by the time the story is over. The worst part? He finally starts developing three-quarters through and goes right back to the bratty child he was in the first few eps. The same can be said of Mikasa. This anime is one of the few to portray women with some form of decency, but Mikasa's obsession with Eren is a pretty sad window of how the author wants people to worship his poorly-designed protagonist. To boot, Mikasa literally has no flaws other than her obsession with Eren. No character flaws. No ability flaws. Her only real flaw is her obsession with Eren, which usually only winds up helping them, not causing them problems like it should. Your only real likable protagonist? Armin. He is one of maybe three characters we really see that has a solid character, solid flaws, and solid development based on those flaws and his interactions with other characters due to the plot. In all honesty, Armin should have been the main protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nNow we move onto enjoyment. Despite vehemently despising roughly eighty-five percent of the cast, I enjoyed Attack on Titan. Is it a great action anime? Sure. Definitely! Is it realistic? Sad to say, but no it is not. Is it the most well-written anime ever? Astronomically far from it. If you're looking for an action anime to sit down and enjoy, this is a wonderful choice. If you're looking for an action anime with a strong plot and emphasis on lovable characters, I recommend pretending that you never heard the hype and staying far away from this anime. \\n\\n\r\nWith a heavy heart, I cannot give the anime anything higher than a 5/10 in good conscience. It had oodles of potential, but an irritating cast, some half-baked plot elements, and predictability ruined it. Mediocre at best.",

            "content": "I started watching Shingeki no Kyojin a year ago, almost to the day that I am writing this. So I figured I would write a review on what has grown to be one of my favourite series of all time.\r\nWhat I've noticed is that people tend to be very split about this anime; you either love it, or you hate it. Clearly, in my case, I love this entire series (the show, the manga, the side-stories, etc.) Now onto the actual review.\r\nStory: 9\r\nAt its core, Shingeki no Kyojin is something that we have seen many times in the past: humanity is being attacked, therefore wemust defend ourselves. Many, many iconic shows start from this format. However, SNK (as I will be calling it for the rest of the review) takes this simple plot point and expands it into something very, very unique. We have the Titans: giant, humanoid creatures set on devouring humans. Because of the Titans, humanity has been driven behind three walls, with the population dwindling to less than 1% of our current population. \\n\\n\r\nEach and every single plot point in this series is completely thought out and executed stunningly. There are so many twists that you won't be able to see coming. Hell, check out episode 8- you'll be shocked. Even the filler is thought out, and has important significance to the main story. The story of SNK goes even further in the manga. At the time of writing this review, there has been 59 chapters released, and we are just only starting to scratch the surface of this world.\\n\\n\r\nLike most things out there, SNK does have its flaws. But the flaws are so minuscule that it's very, very hard to notice them. The brilliant storytelling of this series completely blew me away from episode 1, which is why it deserves a near perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIf you have read the SNK manga, you'll know that the art, while it is good, isn't amazing. The anime cleaned up all of the character designs, leaving us with a beautiful result. While there were some minor changes in characters (ex Eren's eye colour, Levi's physique, etc,) the anime designs did stay pretty true to the original material. The designs match the characters' personalities completely, which is something that not a lot of shows can brag about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the animation is breathtaking. Every single sky we see, the birds eye views; the scenery in this anime is absolutely stunning. And the animation for the characters and their situations is pretty great, too. To me, this is digital animation to the finest degree. But again, as is the case with most shows, SNK does have some animation flaws. For example, in one episode, the same frame is shown about three times. The characters can also have a case of \"far away face\", but that is pretty common. Again, these flaws in animation are pretty small, and are barely noticeable when you are watching the show. They do not take away from the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe score for SNK was done by Hiroyuki Sawano. If you don't recognize his name, he also composed the score for things like Kill la Kill, Ao no Exorcist, and more recently Aldnoah.Zero. If I could use any one word to describe the sound of SNK, it would be flawless. The score matches every scene perfectly, mixing electronics with more orchestral pieces. If you don't have any interest in watching the show, I would still suggest you download the OSTs. The sound for this show blew me away. Even the background noises, the additional sound FX- they were all done to the utmost perfection.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings for SNK were all absolutely amazing. It's no wonder that Guren no Yumiya in particular has landed on many \"top 10 anime openings\" lists. The songs will get stuck in your head, and refuse to leave. In my case, they have not left in a year, and that's something that is very hard to do in my case. Just check out the OPs and EDs online; you'll be amazed at how great they are.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the voice acting is nothing to laugh at, either. With many shows that I've seen, I've noticed that the voices don't match with the characters. Either the voice is too weak, too bold, meek, etc- this is not the case with SNK. Each character is voiced perfectly; each voice matches the personality of the character. The passion put into the voice acting of the show is nothing to laugh at. The voice actors were able to portray each and every line and emotion perfectly, which is something very hard to do. The dub is a different story (but we don't talk about the dub....)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis is where most people decided whether they love or hate this show. To be fair, the characters in SNK can sometimes seem a little extreme with their personalities. However, I love them. For example, the main character Eren can seem very angry, very passionate. Some people hate this. They think he's just a trope amped up to the extreme. In my opinion, Eren's character was done perfectly. His \"extreme\" emotions fit his personality up to a T. \\n\\n\r\nThe personalities of each character in this show are fleshed out near perfectly, in my opinion. Again, some aspects can seem extreme, but that is part of the enjoyment of this series. Not one character is deemed as \"perfect.\" They each have their flaws, which makes them seem very human and realistic. As the story goes on, each point in each characters' personality is explained in detail, even if it seems unimportant initially.\\n\\n\r\nEach character in this series serves a purpose. The main characters, the main supporting characters, the regular supporting characters- each and every one of them is important. There is a lot of death in this show, but every single death we see is important to the story and the character development. And while some deaths may seem insignificant, they really aren't. The entire emotional journey of this series stems from the characters, and SNK has pretty powerful ones.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of blood and gore. Really, I'm not. There have been several shows, live-action or animated, that I have had to drop because of their content. When a show like SNK, which has copious amounts of both blood and gore, can become one of my favourites, you know that it is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single episode of SNK had me captivated. Even the filler ones. Each and every episode was an emotional journey from start to finish. Waiting for the episodes to air every week was torture, because I so desperately wanted to see everything happen (even if I had already read the manga.) I loved every single episode, even the OVAs that have been released. Each release had me on edge, with both the show and the manga. Nothing was dull; everything was riveting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThere is a reason why this show doesn't score perfect. It has its flaws, as everything does. But there is also a reason why it scores so high.\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin was one of the most popular, if not the MOST popular anime of 2013. There is a reason for this. There is a reason why so many people watch, read, and enjoy this series, even if they're not into anime or manga. There is a reason why there are copious amounts of fan works for this series. There is a reason why so much merchandise has been released. There is a reason why so many people cosplay characters from this series.\\n\\n\r\nLike it or hate it, you really can't deny how popular it is. I personally love everything about it. Keep in mind that this is only my opinion; other people will tell you different things. But to me, Shingeki no Kyojin is stunning.",

            "content": "Let's get straight to it! Shingeki no Kyojin is an incredibly gripping, action packed show, and it is certainly capable of converting non-anime watchers. When you begin to understand the plight of humanity versus the titans, you'll quickly begin to realize that this is a show of epic proportions - essentially it is an inter species war: and violence comes hand in hand with this theme, so squeamish viewers might want to look elsewhere.\r\nThe show is incredibly engaging, and intense because the combat animations are executed perfectly, giving a really personal front row seat throughout. Not only this but peril is constantly a reinforced aspectof the anime, and what's scarier is the accurate scale of death that isn't afraid to engulf those that the viewer has become connected to.\\n\\n\r\nI'm liking this logical order, because with death brings me to the next area i'd like to explain: Drama! Oh boy you'll be astounded by the dramatic, emotional and often angry outbursts of the characters. I personally would rank Shingeki no Kyojin highly in all of its presentation methods.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not all, because in addition to being well presented, violent and dramatic, the show still then has the drive to steer you into corners via breakthroughs in the story. Another beautiful aspect of the show is that although the context would say that humanity had been surviving for over a century, the titans are still a great mystery to the present characters, therefore putting you (the viewer) on the front line for discovering more!\\n\\n\r\nDespite how i'm in awe with so many parts of the anime, the story if i'm honest is a bit too linear, as in i don't think enough goes on behind the scenes of titan combat. The plot summary introductions are also a pain due to their repetitiveness, it really is easy to pick up the story line behind the show, yet to an extent where it almost feels like it's been dumbed down.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, i agree with the masses, this popular anime lives up to its reputation, and you really must see for yourself!",

What have I done?\r\nHow am I not able to feel the stun?...\r\nI will write about \"Attack on Titan\" here;\r\nbut yeah, I'm no fanboy trying to endear\r\nmyself to mainstream now or in the longer run.\r\nI turned towards this show unbiased\r\nconsidering its popularity at highest.\r\nI wanted to see if this action show at least\r\nconveys more meanings than being a bloody feast.\r\nBut in the end: people and story at its driest.\r\nSo hundreds of years ago, the humankind\r\nis letting itself be completely confined\r\nby dim-witted looking titans there\r\ninside a 50-meter wall ensnare\r\nand is now searching for ways to get behind.\r\nThen suddenly, a 60-meter giant attacks\r\nand manymore titans are making their tracks.\\n\r\nThe wall can't hold it anymore\\n\r\nand so the humans are fighting another war.\\n\r\nTheir enemies won't give them more time to relax!\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes are quite intense,\\n\r\nexperiencing human's crumbling defence,\\n\r\ngetting their normal lives torn up again,\\n\r\nhaving to survive in a diminishing den,\\n\r\nand nearly losing their last kind of sense.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow Eren, who has to sustain\\n\r\nhis mother's loss, indeed a great pain.\\n\r\nHe wants to kick some titan's ass\\n\r\nand finally falls into the shounen mass,\\n\r\nalways acting like tightened by an angry chain.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanied by one of the few\\n\r\nmore normal humans, Mikasa, whose true\\n\r\nintention is to save her Eren\\n\r\nand so she's getting ears more barren\\n\r\ndespite her strength she would rather sue.\\n\\n\r\nThe third in league, weak fair-haired Armin, stays\\n\r\nthe cowardly one with a frightened face.\\n\r\nHe tends to think far more than others\\n\r\nbut is mostly hindering his brothers.\\n\r\nHe needs lots of time to realise his place.\\n\\n\r\nSo maybe you would think that some other\\n\r\nguys inside these walls don't try to bother,\\n\r\nbut instead act more heroic inside this hell.\\n\r\nYou see, Commander Levi's the only one memorable;\\n\r\nhe wouldn't even trade his tenacity for his mother.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, these characters just won't try\\n\r\nto develop properly and we ask why?\\n\r\nWhy haven't they used episodes five to twelve\\n\r\nto let them build some features or delve\\n\r\ninto their motivations or what they go by?\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, you won't remember any other names.\\n\r\nThey die like flies and only the main remains.\\n\r\nSo I really wondered the whole time where\\n\r\nthe more seasoned soldiers would deign to dare\\n\r\nto get into the fight, but you know what it claims...\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, the probably most important thing:\\n\r\nWhat are the titans? Ruled by a king?\\n\r\nWhat are their bloody true intentions?\\n\r\nHinder humanity from some kind of interventions?\\n\r\nWe aren't informed, and that's a serious sting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the style and art does kind of save all it\\n\r\nfrom falling into a much more deeper pit.\\n\r\nDetailed architecture and nice quality,\\n\r\nalthough the animations strive for equality,\\n\r\nbut the art got me astounded, I must admit!\\n\\n\r\nWhat you will hear is mostly amazing.\\n\r\nThe music improves the already fast pacing\\n\r\nbut cannot reach my most favourite sides\\n\r\nlike Code Geass with \"Stories\" provides.\\n\r\nSo it's epic, and rather the common saving.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention for an awesome opening theme\\n\r\nmixing German and Japanese for deserved esteem.\\n\r\nIt conveys this rather intimidating mood,\\n\r\nlets us taste of the upcoming action food.\\n\r\nBelieving the whole show's that epic: it stays a dream.\\n\\n\r\nNow summarizing art and sound: they're nice;\\n\r\nbut paying with a decent story at least twice.\\n\r\nMan, there are so many episodes for fill,\\n\r\nthe pacing is off, the direction needs skill,\\n\r\ninferring that eight episodes clearly would suffice.\\n\\n\r\nSome people will ask how I can say\\n\r\nthis show is average and carried away...\\n\r\nIt has nothing like a memorable plot\\n\r\nand tends to dramatize quite a lot,\\n\r\njust not worth for every fan to stay!\\n\\n\r\nI can't deny the certain amount of joy\\n\r\nthe first few episodes deliver, oh boy!\\n\r\nBut after that, it's nothing new...\\n\r\nNo inspirations I aim to pursue...\\n\r\nIts part to perplex hardly evens the one to annoy.\\n\\n\r\nSo this practically concludes my review.\\n\r\n\"Do not believe the hype\" became so true!\\n\r\nIf you like some standard action shows,\\n\r\nthen Attack on Titan doesn't have much to oppose,\\n\r\nbut otherwise it isn't worth any ballyhoo.",

            "content": "This anime made my mouth open wide for longer than 5 seconds more than a handful times. This is the type of world where more people get killed than the entirety of the A Song of Ice and Fire series. It exists in a timeless universe \u2013 not in the past, present or future of our world, but in a pocket universe where Titans existed long before the existence of machines. In this world, machines were not invented to improve humanity\u2019s lifestyle, but for the continuous existence of humanity itself.\r\nThere\u2019s lots of shouting (especially from Eren), lots of action, lots of character development, and lotsof tears. My friends weren\u2019t kidding. I felt like my ear drums would break from all the intense shouting. I think my mind is forever scarred, what with how everyone got crushed like ants all the time. And my heart has become immune to all other fictional deaths, what with all the deaths I\u2019ve experienced just from this show alone.\\n\\n\r\nIt teaches you a lot about what it takes to be a soldier, a survivor. Constantly, people have to be reminded to \u201cFIGHT!\u201d Some lines are repeated all over the anime that it kind of becomes engraved into your head and heart once you\u2019re done with it.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the kind of anime that sticks with you, the kind that leaves you with phantom faces with phantom voices following you around, making you feel as if you\u2019re still living in that universe, even after you\u2019ve told yourself that you\u2019re done with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of the villain, and of the world itself, is scary and genius. First off, the villain \u2013 the Titan \u2013 is basically a stupid giant human cannibal.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike other villains, it doesn\u2019t want revenge. It doesn\u2019t want world domination. It doesn\u2019t want power. It doesn\u2019t need to eat. It has lived a hundred years without eating humans. But it is all it ever eats. It doesn\u2019t eat animals. It wants only one thing \u2013 and this is just a theory, but it\u2019s one that I can side with, and one that I love the most \u2013 to annihilate the existence of humanity.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the fact that it looks human. It is, in every aspect, a human being, except for the fact that it doesn\u2019t have two things; sexual organs, and a conscience. Countless times, characters had their feet rooted to the ground, unable to fight, and I think it\u2019s because the image of a gigantic human biting off a human\u2019s neck is just too fascinatingly cruel that they feel they cannot look away.\\n\\n\r\nThe world itself is scarier than the world of the Hunger Games. And I think what makes it scary is the fact that humanity has never won against the Titans, ever. For the past who-knows-how-many-years, Titans have been eating humans.\\n\\n\r\nThe humans in this world pretend that they have a system.\\n\\n\r\no matter what plan the humans think of, no matter how determined every single one of their skilled soldiers are, they will still be crushed in less than a second without remorse, without even a body to prove that you have existed. This is their anarchy, their \u2018chaos\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single man, woman and child in this world lived with losing a loved one as a social norm. It\u2019s a dark fact I\u2019d like everyone to consider. Everyone is already dead, in everyone else\u2019s eyes. That\u2019s what\u2019s sad about this whole thing \u2013 even the humans think of other humans as just tiny insects with no importance. But it\u2019s also beautiful, because sometimes, sometimes a character sees through that corrupted notion and calls everyone else out on it, making us realize it along the way too.\\n\\n\r\nSo you have a dark world, and an even darker society. Combine that with real-life everyday problems like corruption in the system, hierarchy in social status, differences in privileges and human rights and what do you get? Awesome badass characters who naiively try to fight against it.\\n\\n\r\nThe differences in character personality is great, too. There are a few who are extremely righteous, but most of them just really don\u2019t care. They feign an act of indifference, but all for different reasons. But the fact that they had grieved over the death of a loved one united them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I think that\u2019s brilliant. These clashes of personality, and this unity for one tragedy, has bonded them together, and changed them greatly. You get to see how much they have grown in a span of 5-7 years. That\u2019s something I don\u2019t usually see in anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou also get to witness the amazing 3D Maneuver Gear.\\n\\n\r\nThis made the whole world look kind of sci-fi, but also, kind of not. The 3D Maneuver Gears are as close as we can get to a \u2018high tech\u2019 fictional gadget in this world. Every other man made thing you see in the anime is pretty mundane. But the function of it makes the people actually fly. It\u2019s a pretty brilliant concept, and I like how something as complicated as that is a seemingly-ordinary thing for them. Plus, it makes the animation really cool to watch. You gotta respect the amount of effort (and physics, I bet) put just to make sure each maneuver looks even just a little legit.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is amazing, too. There were some points where I gaped like a fish because \u201cwHaT just happened omg\u201d and the music dramatically intensified my feelings. So kudos to that! The animation was splendid, hands down. Especially, like I said, with the whole 3D Maneuver thing.",

            "content": "The hype of 2013 leading to an ending that closed off lots of action and questions throughout its run. With an anime that has a lot of hype, comes a lot of conflict between haters and people who genuine enjoy the anime. Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime that made peaks in sales and getting fans world wide, but is it really worth watching? \r\nThe concept of humanity being at the brink of extinction, this is one emphasizes it's fight for survival and the ups and downs of their fight for victory. With the first episode starting off with a great clincher to get youexcited for the rest of series, you get a little view of how each character is and their view point towards the situation. \\n\\n\r\nDue to the story of humans being driven to extinction, you often get an anime that can be a hit or a miss depending on how they unravel it throughout the series. Humans are declining with titans appearing onto earth and they eventually make a wall tall enough to the point where even the tallest titan can't break through. \\n\\n\r\nWith the show being a fight for survival, it does an excellent job actually dragging out the battle to its actual length. With anime these days battle scenes are usually only an episode with the exception of it being mostly dialog. Attack on Titan has arcs of each fight against the titans or progress in the story. You're given arcs that focus on a battle to take back a city, an expedition outside the walls, and even a battle taking place inside their safest town. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime you get stories of some characters past and they're definitely something that makes each character enjoyable and much more interesting to watch as the series progresses forward. The characters are mainly focuses on Eren, Mikasa and Armin. They're what drives the story and is the foundation for all the events that happen.\\n\\n\r\nYou have the main character Eren, a boy who does before he thinks. This often gets him into a lot of fights and is what drives his friends to do more than they expect they can do. With his mother being eaten in front of him, you get a lot of realism towards his feelings to the situation and an actual reason for his hate rather than the generic hero title.\\n\\n\r\nSecond you have Mikasa, a girl who is brave and does anything to protect Eren. They're not related, but they're brother and step-sister, but act just like siblings. They bicker and often get into fights due to different feelings  and agreements. She's usually level-headed and very mature, but you'll see when something happens to Eren, she breaks down and becomes very agitated. \\n\\n\r\nLastly you have Armin, hes the brains of the group and emotional support for both of them. While lacking in physical strength he excels in strategy and decision making. While not being the main focus of the anime, he's probably the character with the most development. At the start hes weak and afraid, but towards the end he becomes mentally strong and definitely a changed person due to the events that occur to him and his friends.\\n\\n\r\nWith anime being military themed, you're given characters who are joined in with them due to squads and become their friends. You have characters who disagree with a lot of what they do, and some that are just like them and get along well. The side characters are also important for what happens and really drive the story with their back stories and talent that they bring to the group.\\n\\n\r\nKnown for having excellent art, I have nothing to say that can disagree with that. The art through the entire anime stays at top quality and even has detail in every aspect of the show. With all the scenery being changed constantly through the battles, you see buildings that were once standing being ruined and detail in everything. You can see the emotion on all of the characters faces as they witness their comrades being eaten alive. \\n\\n\r\nThe scenery seems to be staged in what seems like Europe, you see a lot of forests and old-style buildings. With all the scene changes you can see detail in everything such as trees, buildings and even the clothes that the characters wear. It makes it feel like the Middle Ages or so, with the wool and texture the clothes has.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to the theme of extiction, you get 2 wonderful openings to hype you for the anime. With the first half being set around emphasizing their survival, you get an opening that has lots of action and despair to give the feeling of struggle the characters are going through. The second half is more towards the counter attack that mankind has and their subtle victories and their path towards winning against the titans. The opening gives that feeling of excitement and shows their steps to becoming closer to surviving and prospering once again. With battles happening constantly and emotion going across the board with characters dying, or even victory, you get excellent background music to support those feelings even more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is something that lives up to its hype and does a good job having a really serious tone, but also giving off some comedy to balance it out. The story is something that has been done often, but this is one that emphasizes humanities survival. The art is top quality and is the best of the 2013 season to make every battle scene beautiful and movements very clean. The characters were all really well developed and really makes the viewer sad when they die, even though they've only just been introduced a few episodes ago. Anyone who enjoys an action or looking for a great anime to pass time, this is definitely worth checking out.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin is an amazingly written story with a very dark premise and a lot of action. This is definitely not a series for the faint of heart, especially those with fears of man-eating giants that don't even have the decency to kill you before they eat you (sometimes). The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, there's a new reveal that completely destroys what you thought you knew and makes you wonder just how far the rabbit hole goes. The characters are very relatable and you really do want to see them succeed. What makes this series unique however is the protagonists veryrarely ever win a battle. Every mission the cast engage in usually ends in a blood bath, but it's not without purpose. The gruesome deaths we witness just cements how high the stakes are in this story, and the determination of the protagonists to push forward is very inspiring.\\n\r\nAnother unique thing about the cast is they are rather three-dimensional in comparison to a lot of anime and manga I've seen. Where I expect some characters to be completely flat jerkasses or emotionless bastards, there's always something that really makes you like them. The series also makes a point of establishing that no matter what you see on the outside, the characters certainly feel and act human deep down. This makes it really heart breaking when you see characters you like die in the line of duty, and only makes you want to see the good guys succeed all the more, which serves to make their victories so much sweeter.\\n\r\ntl;dr, This series is a must-read/watch. If you have a weak stomach or a phobia for cannibalistic slasher smiles, give it a miss. Otherwise, give it your full attention.",

            "content": "If you\u2019re an anime or manga patron, you\u2019ve more than likely heard of, if you haven\u2019t already read or seen, a series entitled Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan). Based on the popular manga, Shingeki no Kyojin had been made into an anime in 2013, that had literally taken the entire world by storm. It's even been airing on American Television alongside other popular shows such as One Piece and Naruto. It\u2019s popularity is getting to the point where it\u2019s damn near impossible to say the word \u201canime\u201d without someone bringing up Shingeki no Kyojin. But is Shingeki no Kyojin worth the hype? \r\nPlot: One-hundredyears prior to the start of the series, mankind was plagued by their predators, The Titans, gigantic humanoid creatures whose only purpose in existence is to devour humans, despite having no apparent need to eat in order to survive. Humanity was driven to the brink of extinction. The few surviving humans built a society behind 50-meter walls that kept the Titans out. The walls were named Maria, the outermost wall, Rose, the middle, and Sina, the interior. There, humanity enjoyed a century of peace... Until... Our main characters, teenage boy Eren Yeager and his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman witness something horrific... The city's \"divine\" walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother along with thousands of other humans are eaten alive. Eren vows to murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind. And so, mankind finds their secret weapon in defeating the Titans... \\n\\n\r\nFirst thing you may be wondering, is this anime as epic as everyone says it is, and is it filled with amazing action scenes? Well eh, I guess you could say that it's a tiny bit, not too much, but just a teeny bit ... IT'S DEFINITELY EPIC. This anime's introduction of the 3D maneuver gear was certainly an creative pleasant to the say the least, surprise. The way the characters jump/literally fly from rooftop to rooftop, swinging their dual swords at Titans, screaming their lungs at every second leaves the viewers mouths opened, and their eyes glued onto the screen. May I add that the soundtrack in this anime is arguably the best set of music in an anime ever. It's epic music certainly adds to the suspense of every single episode in Shingeki no Kyojin. The only thing I'd say took away from the EPICness in Shingeki, was that there was awfully too many dialogue scenes... Although some were pretty nerve-wrecking, others seemed to be useless and pointless.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly... is this plot depressing? Yup. Are there multiple scenes that have brought me to tears? Yup. Have I witnessed characters I love meet their end in horribly gruesome ways? Yup. This is not an anime for the faint-hearted. Shingeki no Kyojin will ruthlessly rip your heart out, throw it into a grinder, then turn it into processed dog food time after time after time ... after time again. This anime is also quite gory, so if you can't stand that, I'd... still recommend you to give Shingeki no Kyojin a try. \\n\\n\r\nAs for me, what I had wondered the most were, is this plot deep (theme)? efficiently written? And enjoyable to watch? Is there an explanation for everything that happens or is it one of those anime that something happens for no reason or leaves me going What happened to the _____ or how did he/she even know _____.\\n\r\nThe storyline itself has no contradictions, is full to the brim with plot twists that are almost impossible to predict. And most importantly, it is VERY enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\n(Skip if you don't care about historical information + deep themes) Well I will say that the plot has a deep theme. The circle of life and escaping every-day routine and achieving freedom (humans trapped within walls, never seeing the ocean, mountains, volcanoes, forests, plains, and never having an adventure until...) concept is included in the plot. What was also quite intriguing that you probably didn't know was in Shingeki no Kyojin was the use of Norse Allusions. Narrative tales for centuries have, for centuries, been borrowing and re-constructing myths from previous generations in order to create new tales to amuse and inspire. Mythology has been incorporated into many stories to provide emphasis on major themes and create a more complex universe for the reader to experience. \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d written by Hajime Isayama draws extensive inspiration Nordic myth such as Snorri\u2019s \u201cGylfaginning\u201d and \u201cProse Edda,\u201d creating integral elements and parallels within the story by incorporating fundamental Norse ideologies into the fictional universe\u2019s framework. It is these elements of inter-textuality that create a context in which hermetic moments can be experienced, while expressing creativity through the literary tradition of interpretation through connotation. As for the circle of life, humans for once are on the side of the preys. Why is it wrong for titans to eat us, while it's okay for us to (raise and) kill animals in order to eat them? In this world, the strong are the predators, and the weak are the preys. The strong steal all and win all, the weak get stolen from and lose all. That's just how this rotten world (in reality) works. The anime delves into the \"strength\" of humans vs the titans. Escaping everyday routine has been a theme in many famous stories, such as \"The Dubliners\" (read it, very famous). How can a person live when doing the same thing over... and over... and over everyday. How would you feel if you were confined within a small amount of space and never allowed to go outside of that tiny space because you would get eaten mercilessly by a predator out there?\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound in the anime is absolutely spectacular. The soundtrack of Shingeki no Kyojin, composed by Hiruko Sawano is (insert the greatest positive word you can think of). The openings were absolutely incredible as well, and I'm sure that everyone, whether or not you've seen the anime has heard of and fairly enjoyed/absolutely loved the opening, \"Guren Yumiya\". I believe it's the most famous anime song ever. The art is fairly nicely drawn up, and the drawn up 3D maneuver gear certainly was well made. I must say in terms of visuals, the titans were drawn up to perfection! Their faces are disgustingly disfigured and what is up their skin/teeth! They look creepy as fuck, which is great! As for the characters, each person was fairly well drawn up... Although I wouldn't say great! and the horses/skies/plains (nature) was absolutely beautiful and realistically drawn. I must mention that the freedom of wing capes were quite desirable, very cool capes/art.\\n\\n\r\nEren is anything but a traditional protagonist. While a typical hero is driven by a great sense of morality, honor, pride, or a desire to make the world a better place for everyone\u2019s sake and not just their own, Eren takes every stereotype and crushes it. Having lost his mother to Titian, monsters that he already despised to begin with, Eren\u2019s motivation to join the military and eradicate the Titans are based purely on his bloodthirsty need for revenge, not his desire to improve the world. While it is true that he has expressed that he wants to see the world outside the walls, he didn\u2019t really show initiative (his crazy hatred) until his mother died (although he did plan on joining the recon corps).Perhaps my favorite trait of Eren is that, even though he\u2019s the main protagonist, he is pretty weak as a fighter. That is a quality that makes Eren very real. He\u2019s not an overpowered main character; he\u2019s human. He has powers, but his powers are pretty much the only reason he\u2019s still alive. He\u2019s not some kind of god, and he\u2019s far from invincible. He\u2019s, at the core, just a very angry boy that has lost his mother and wants to avenge her, and he does so with an unbreakable spirit. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Mikasa Ackerman, she is a quiet and withdrawn girl and maintains a near constant stoic expression, except when Eren is in danger. Mikasa's attachment to Eren may or not not go beyond feelings of siblings (well, she is adopted). Mikasa is one of those characters that people will love because first off she's beautiful, secondly she's funny and somewhat kind and mean at the same time, and to top it off, and last not but least she's the concrete definition of badass (kicks some Titan ass).\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least our 3rd main character Armin Arlert, a cowardly smart boy who possesses a sharp mind and a natural intuition for strategy which has proven useful on many occasions. Armin Arlert is a character that some will hate for his cowardice and \"no fightingness\" but others will like because he actually uses his brain, and you have to feel bad for him for being so very human (fear). \\n\\n\r\nWhy did I present dragging info on the characters? Because, their charactistics all add so much to the anime. All the other characters in Shingeki no Kyojin are quite likeable, it's just a shame that a lot of them will die out one by one before your eyes. And of course, I will have to mention Levi because he's obviously the most popular character in Shingeki no Kyojin. Why? Well because first of all, he's smart, secondly he's always composed, thirdly he kicks everyones ass, both humans and titans, fourthly he wants to protect people and is in a way a \"jesus\" figure to mankind, and lastly and most importantly, his fetish for always cleaning makes him a hilarious character.  \\n\\n\r\nEven though the whole concept of naked giants devouring humans sounds a little weird at first, the main idea behind it (that is, humans not being on top of the food chain anymore) is pretty well done and the plot grows into an epic adventure that you would regret not watching. Overall the anime is very enjoyable and although some people may call it overrated (it can't be everyone's favorite anime...) I will tell you that you'd regret not watching it for sure. Epic is written all over the anime.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: I guess it's a bit overrated considering it could become the most popular anime of all time, but it's certainly not as bad as a lot of haters claim it is. I guess the hate can't be helped though since with popularity and greatness comes hate. But, people can have different perspectives on things, that's what makes humans so great right? That concludes my review, thanks for reading!~",

            "content": "It pains me in a way to not give Attack on Titan anything but a 10. I completely understand why this show got so popular so fast. I also understand why everybody is impatiently waiting for season 2. I want to say that it is really as flawless as people say it is.\r\nBut I can't. While I would genuinely recommend this show, I am still a critic. I still have to acknowledge that this show has problems.\r\nAs good as this show is, and it is very, very good, I cannot with a good conscience say that it does not have glaring flaws. The biggest isthe simple fact that this show has too much talk. I know that dialogue is crucial to telling a story and developing character, but there is a time and a place for it. There were several occasions where they have a really good story coming up in what should be the very next episode, but the show digs its heels into the ground and spends an entire episode talking about what was coming. It just seems like whenever this show can build up momentum, it feels the need to deploy the drag chute. This show is not nearly fast-paced enough. But this problem also appears within the action. There are so many five minute long conversations, or inner monologues, or flashback sessions smack in the middle of an action scene. The pacing of this show seriously needs work.\\n\r\nThankfully, the good aspects of this show trump the bad ones hundredfold. The action is incredible, the art is distinctive, and the voice acting is some of the best that I have ever seen. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But it is by all means worth watching.",

            "content": "This will be my first ever review on this website, and I figured it best to start with the one series most fresh in my mind.  Attack on Titan was one of the most rewarding anime experiences I've ever had.  Unique premise, serious characters and a vivid soundtrack and art style make the first season of this show one to remember.  I will keep this review spoiler free, as to not ruin the experience for anyone else.\r\nSometimes animes will fall into the trap of taking themselves too seriously.  The main difference about AOT is that it deserves the afforementioned comment.Humanity is on the brink of extinction, being overrun by several meter tall human-like \"titans\" that terrorize and eat humans for just the pleasure of it.  Humankind has succumbed to building three giant walls to protect themselves against the giants, and all was safe and sound....until the first wall was breached by an abnormally gigantic Titan, allowing the smaller ones to get in and annihilate the city.  Eventually the invasion stopped, but the damage had already been done... The number of casualties was astronomical.  The story continues by following Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert as they join the military in hopes of avenging the titan's invasion and The death of Eren's mother.  Throughout the series, their efforts are pivotal in regaining a stronghold in the apocalyptic world.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I love and hate about this series is the character development.  It's just so damn good.  At the same token, it occasionally feels so gut punching when a new character's past is explained, and then they are soon after another casualty in the struggle to survive.  The amount of emotions that are invoked while one watches AOT are tremendous.  I often found myself speaking out loud during a characters close brush with death or laughing during one of Sasha's hungry outbursts.  The story in itself is also unique.  I had been hearing wayyyy too many of the same plots floating around recently, so it was a breath of fresh air to experience AOT firsthand... At the recommendation of so many friends.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art style depicted in this series is also quite incredible.  Influences by Claymore and Casshern Sins are apparent, drawing from past experience of AOTs writer, Yasuko Kobayashi.  I love how dark and gritty the character models can be, and how vivid the backgrounds are drawn.  The music is also epic and fanfareish.  The 2 openings also represent the growth of the story and are both extremely catchy.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, AOT is an anime not to be missed by any fan, especially if you love action and greatly developed characters.  I can't wait until the second season rolls our way soon.",

            "content": "I don't think this review will make me very popular, because I didn't really like Attack on Titan. The first time I tried watching it, I found the first episode so boring and discomforting that I stopped right there. However, as the hype increased and people were hailing it as the best anime of the season, I thought I should give it another shot. The next time I tried watching it, I got to about episode 10 and gave up again. It was too much of a struggle for me. Though after 10 episodes I had started to see the value of the show. \r\nStory:6\\n\r\nI'm sorry, I really am, but there are fundamental structure and pacing issues with AoT. The basic premise is fascinating\u2014a post-apocalyptic world that was ravaged by an almost biblical plague. All of humanity trapped behind walls that are failing to protect them from the monsters outside\u2014but it's execution is lacking. The world, which appears to be richly structured, is never actually elaborated upon: how did they build the walls? What type of social hierarchy exists as a result of the wall? It spends about three episodes on a single battle and then rushes through the training: we go through 5 years in a matter of 3 episodes and then spend another three episodes on what is about a 4 hour period. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also some bizarre story telling choices: [SPOILERS] the protagonist is dead for two whole episodes and in that time they decide it's the best moment to do a flashback to a different character's childhood, while we're still in the middle of a battle sequence. I don't care about her childhood and relationship with the main character: all of the characters are currently in mortal danger and the main character is dead. This is simply not the time. [END SPOILER] There are also general pacing issues: it feels slow, yet we aren't given time to get to know the characters so when the inevitably die, it's hard to really care. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes also have a flat out depressing emotional arc. They start with a smidgen of hope that is just continually stomped down until the end of the episode. I'm sorry, but I like my characters to have a win at least SOME of the time. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also something lacking in the Titans as enemies. They aren't smart, quick, or focused. Watching battle sequences with them is like watching a bunch of flies swarm around someones head. It's just not very interesting. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is outstanding. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. It's gorgeous. The backgrounds are rich, the motion is fluid, and the characters just look good. There is CG, but it's well integrated, and the colors are appealing and appropriate. The only caveat I might have is that it's sometimes a little hard to tell characters apart (but when there as many of them as there in AoT, it's inevitably difficult). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is appropriate and distinctive, the voice acting is strong, and the sound effects don't sound unnatural. I only knocked a point off because the opening theme is sometimes a bit much (I was skipping it by episode 3).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEren is just not a very engaging protagonist. He's a jerk from the moment we meet him, and it feels like he's a jerk for no good reason. He then \"redeems\" himself by deciding to commit his life to a suicidal pursuit of revenge. I found it's tough to appreciate his character, though I did enjoy his inspirational qualities and his defiance of the hopeless state of humanity. \\n\\n\r\nThe side character come off as rather flat. They almost all fit into stereotypes that have predictable story lines. I do enjoy Jean, though, and I would be curious to see if he becomes the essential ally to Eren that I suspect him to be. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nIt was fun on occasion, but overall it was not very enjoyable or challenging. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nThis is definitely a good series\u2014and for those who enjoy dark, battle driven series, particularly fantasy, I highly suggest it (though I warn that I loved Code Geass, another dark, battle driven series, but disliked this). I hesitate, however to call it great.",

            "content": "What would happen if humanity was no longer on the top of the food chain?  How would we adapt, and how would our perception of the world change?  Tetsur\u014d Araki came to answer these questions with the release of his latest series.  It is a tale of tragedy and revenge; of uplifting hope and crushing sadness.  A love letter to the struggle of humanity and its destructive nature.  This is Attack On Titan.\r\nSetting:\r\nThe exact location and time place of AOT is unknown, but based off of the clothing, architectural style and character names it is safe to say that theseries is located around Germany and takes place during the 17th century.  Humanity has locked itself away behind three impossibly tall walls named Maria, Rose and Sina.  After the outer most wall, Maria is assaulted and damaged titans flood in, starting our tale of woe.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story of AOT is quite simple, but not in a bad way.  Yasuko Kobayashi (the anime writer) didn't over complicate the plot with half baked symbolism or conspiracy pandering.  AOT knows exactly where it wants to go and doesn't waste any time getting there.  Don't get me wrong I'm not saying the series is dull, far from it actually; I just find it refreshing to watch a show that doesn't spend the first half trying to convince about me how cool and artsy it is.  I knew exactly what I was getting, and AOT never changed that.  In addition to the narrative, the actual setting is wonderfully crafted.  While removed from reality AOT never strays to far from the believable.  Everything fits from a historical point of view; the powerful religious presence, the centralized political structure, the proper use of period weaponry.  The only problem with the story its pacing.  While fine for most the show it does tend to drag between episodes 10-15.  The show presents our characters with a simple task that takes them far too long to complete.          \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note I found a lot of similarities between AOT and the average mecha story line.  While AOT is leaps and bounds over most generic mechas I couldn't help, but make some connections.  Angry new-comer discovers hidden robot (titan power), uses robot to avenge loved one, fights others with similar robots, gets butt whooped, gets stronger, defeats opponent, rinse and repeat.  I just thought it was an interesting notion.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'll start off this section by saying that, for the most part, AOT was animated by a brand new studio with no other anime under its belt.  Studio Wit is a surrogate of the well know studio Production I.G.; so its member clearly have experience, but until AOT they had never worked directly on a project as a singular group.  So with this in mind it is literally astonishing how much quality this show has.  Seriously, if Attack On Titan were a fruit it would be dripping with the succulent juices of grandeur.  Most shows allocate their budgets to the most \"important\" parts of each episode, i.e. the action scenes.  In turn this causes most of the scenes involving dialogue and plot development to come off as unimportant and lack luster; when in reality these scene are just as, if not more, important than the ones involving action.  However, the animation for AOT never falters; each scene is given the same amount of care as the others.  In addition, this show has an air of excitement about it.  I could tell AOT was more than just another job to Studio Wit; they truly care about this series.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the animation beautiful, the art style itself is brilliant.  The varying thicknesses of black borders around each character and object helps to add an increased field of depth during scenes of rapid movement.  This creates a sense of urgency whenever the characters use their 3DM/ODM gear, only maximizing the excitement the show puts off.  The art of AOT is perfect, literally.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OST for Attack On Titan should be used as model to teach young composers about the necessary elements that make up a great soundtrack.  While not perfect, the OST hits every note it needs to, and then continues on to become even better than required.  Even though all the tracks are great in their own right; a few of them managed to reach the \"anime peak of greatness status\". Those would include the two openings of the series.  Which are easily up there with \"Cowboy Bebop\" and \"Baccano!\" (btw second opening is best....let the fighting ensue).  Sound design on the other hand sits right at the average mark.  Most of the sounds are over used, and were never that great to start.  So, after a while it can leave a bad taste in your mouth.  It works for what it is, but isn't anything to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nAs the astute reader you are, I'm sure you have figured out that I will always watch the English dub if available.  So how is the Attack On Titan dub?  The best way to describe it would be unique.  I say that, because some of the voice actors Funimation picked require a certain taste.  For example, Bryce Papenbrook choose voice Eren in a very forceful manner.  It reminds me how most people sound when they smash their toe; jaw clinched with a slight growl in their voice.  Personally, I rather enjoyed the English dub, but I understand that I am in the minority of this one.  I would recommend to watch the first four episodes in dub, and decide where to go from there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIn the character department I would compare AOT to the critically acclaimed video game \"The Last Of Us\".  I understand that not everyone is a gamer as I am, but just bare with me here.  The characters in both of these are as unoriginal as they come.  However, they weave such a unique story and have such interesting development, that in turn, they become fresh and a great enjoyment to watch.  Some of the development is a bit rushed at times, but it always comes from a natural progression and doesn't feel forced in the slightest.  As any anime junkie would know, that is an accomplishment on its own; especially in this sea of generic rom-coms and forced love triangles.  My main complaint is the lack of development for side characters.  Some get their deserved screen time, but others only receive some kind of goofy quirk as to be memorable without actually accomplishing anything.  We have potato girl (Sasha), bald dude (Connie) and freckles kid (Marco).  I want to know their stories and what kind of people they are beyond their stereotypical traits.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nAll flaws aside, Attack On Titan is one of the most entertaining shows I ever had the pleasure of watching; I can't wait of season 2 to be released.  The action is exciting, the story is tense and the animation is beautiful.  I give it a rating of Must Watch on my scale of recommendation.\\n\\n\r\nMasterpiece-Best\\n\r\nMust Watch\\n\r\nWatch\\n\r\nTry The First Couple Episodes\\n\r\nSkip It\\n\r\nRun For Your Life-Worst \\n\\n\r\nAs usual I recommend you buy a copy, and help support our local dubbing companies and the anime industry as a whole.  However, just taking the time to watch it is of greater importance.\\n\r\nAs a final statement I recommend that you take my numerical scores with a grain of salt; as numerical scores are easily skewed and each person has their own understanding of the 1-10 scale.       \\n",

            "content": "It's nice to have an anime this popular that isn't just tsundere school rom-com no' 10746 for a change. But does that alone make said anime great? No, not really.\r\nThis is a spoiler free review.\r\n*Story*\r\n*Insert synopsis here*\r\nAside from the monsters being replaced with Titans and the interesting weaponry the people have, we've definitely seen similar stories in anime before, whether it's Claymore, Blue Gender and maybe even Highschool of the Dead.\r\nLeaving that aside though, it doesn't do a very good job with its narrative. The story relies on coincidences, has forced exposition, uneventful pacing and it also has unexplored themes that are tossed away assoon as they're raised.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting in general is poorly explored. For example, they make it clear that there's a slave trade going on within these walls, but that issue is never raised again. Apparently they also have religious sects that worship these walls as deities or something, but that's never explored either, aside from killing them off in an ironic and disrespectful manner (hah! that'll teach those religious people for having faith and hope!).  There are even social classes among citizens, and of course, the higher the class, the more evil you are (that's how it works in clich\u00e9 land), but even that is just there to show us what good people the main characters are by comparison.. They also present corruption within the military and competition amongst its different branches. Granted, the latter is explored a little, but the former is hardly touched and is just there to shock you. So despite how rich the setting seems at first, at the end of the day all you will care for is the fight against the titans since the rest just remains background decoration.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a common thing to say that the first episode is Amazing, but I wasn't impressed. To me, the first episode is also the first mistake it made. It seemed deliberately rushed in an attempt to make the audience gasp at the sudden deaths of characters we know nothing about (pure shock effect). \\n\\n\r\nThis is the first mistake because the pacing does slow down significantly later on and I think the first episode was the only one worthy of getting fleshed out more, instead of diving in to the massacre straight away. The rest of the episodes don't even exploit most of their slow pacing very well. It has a habit of slowing down deliberately in order to end most episodes on a cliffhanger. Sure, it might raise the tension, but it also serves to make the series less eventful inside its already limited number of episodes (which means less of a story).\\n\\n\r\nAnd maybe I'm just nitpicking here, but the exposition insults me. It assumes I'm a retard who can't put 2 and 2 together and the characters have to go out of their way to explain things about their world that they should already know just by being born there. This show could've had no dialogue whatsoever and I still could've picked up on a great deal of what's going on. So the script just comes off as amaturish.\\n\\n\r\nAnd like I said, the story also relies on occurrences that are not very likely, but because it involves the main characters, anything is possible. It's nothing that bad or distracting, but I'm still gonna go on a limb here and say; that's not good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, it just ends in the middle of nowhere and leaves you with nothing but another cliffhanger (surprise, surprise).\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair though,  the setting is still pretty creative (as unexplored as it is) and it does do a decent job in foreshadowing some interesting plot twists and gradually revealing mysteries, mainly about the Titans. But that's pretty much it and even that is incomplete for now.\\n\\n\r\n*Characters*\\n\\n\r\nThese are tired shonen characters who are completely out of place.\\n\r\nYou have a Mary Sue who's super strong for no good reason, the smart one and mr angry pants.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, Eren, the angry one has good reasons to be angry, it's completely understandable. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all he is and it's probably not the best idea to have him as a main character since it gets old really fast.\\n\\n\r\nYou also have Mikasa who's an absolute perfect being for some reason (I gave up on questioning it). We can't make her flawed of course since that'd mean she'll have room for character depth, we can't have that. And there's simply nothing to remember her for besides her relationship with Eren, being perfect and her sexy lips. So yeah, a lame character with no development and the most ludicrous backstory I've seen in a while, which also happens to be Eren's backstory. Which explains why she's his pet.\\n\r\nNice..\\n\\n\r\nThe third character is Armin, the weak but smart one. I guess he's ok, since he does seem to grow more than the other two.. Aside from that he's forgettable as well since this show's characterization in general is very shonenish and obnoxious in an otherwise dark setting. \"The power of friendship!\" (ok, they don't actually say that, but they come pretty close).\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, these 3 characters are each supposed to complete each other with their traits, which is a nice idea, but that fact is stated directly to the viewer, much like everything else in this series (so much for subtlety).\\n\\n\r\nThere's also another notable character named Jean, who's kinda like the Vegeta or the rival in a shonen series. And much like Vegeta, he's the only one who goes through actual growth and he even reacts to the events in a way that resembles a human being. Too bad he wasn't the main character, he suits the grim setting much better than the others.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters are defined mainly by their quirks or their looks and there are others who are just evil for the sake of being hated by the audience and aren't shown more than once. Many secondary characters aren't fleshed out and the vast majority of deaths in this series are of nameless characters or ones you don't remember. It's understandable considering the circumstances, but that just makes the main cast appear more plot armored than they already are. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the characterization of common people during the intense moments is pretty decent. Probably a little over the top at times, but I still think it was handled rather well with how they panic and such.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters could've been worse, I mean at least they have character consistency, they are given some focus and I should probably applaud them for not being overly sexualized, which is a very rare thing in anime these days. But I have no clue what people see in them since most of them are pretty simple and feel ridiculously out of place.\\n\\n\r\n*Art & Sound*\\n\\n\r\nI'll cover this part more briefly.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are kind of unique, I guess. I actually like the thick outlines the artwork has, you really don't see those much anymore.  The surroundings look beautiful, both the forests and the towns. Everything just seems gigantic. The animation itself (while not always consistent) is great and the battles with the 3d camera movement is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. Though I wasn't too thrilled about most of the Titan designs, and some are significantly cooler than others.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is arguably one of the best openings in recent years, it's just masterful (too bad opening 2 happened midway). Same goes for the soundtrack in general which is beautifully intense and makes everything seem more epic. The voice acting is nothing special and maybe even over the top, but I realize that the script probably told them to scream a lot, which is not always easy to pull off so give them some slack.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed some of it, but from a point on I mainly just watched it apathetically. I do concede that it's not a boring watch, that's for sure.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI've been mostly negative in this review, but to be fair it was still a fine show, or at least passable in some respects and the production values are great. But I doubt it will stand the test of time\\n",

            "content": "Attack on Titan is one of the manga turned to anime on recent period. It is an Action anime with focus on tragedy and very dark tone, yet maintaining some Shonen-esque messages such as trust and overcoming fears.\r\nStory:\r\nWhile the story isn't as rich as other shows in general, it is rather a very fresh take on human tragedy without reusing much of the usual apocalypse elements. There is also much lore in the world to keep creative fans making fanworks and adaptions of the world of Attack on Titan. The thrill element is very high and makes you eager to see what's next.\r\nKeep in mindthis anime covers only a portion of the manga and stops at the end of an arc. You will have to wait for the 2nd season or continue on in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe visuals are extremely unique in style and well done. The value here nearly matches an OVA/Movie feels.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nPeople are digging the opening song of the show as well as some soundtracks. However for me it is good but other than the opening, I didn't feel much uniqueness to the soundtracks or specific themes to get attached with. Voice acting is good enough but there is no memorable voice so far.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are lots of variety of characters and they have high appealing. However, in term of design and visual uniqueness, it is very limited since everyone is sticking to his uniform. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe action scenes are well done specially nearing the ending of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you are into action, thrill, tragedy and want something that feels new, do not miss this anime.",

            "content": "If there was ever an anime experience that would leave you needing therapy, marathon-watching Shingeki no Kyojin is it. Perhaps this is the best way to watch this series; by the end, you'd be so emotionally exhausted and mangled, you'll know what total despair is like. Not since Berserk have I seen an anime capable of utterly destroying... hope. Yet in spite of its soul-crushing hopelessness, Shingeki no Kyojin is entirely about hope. Without it, mankind would have nothing.\r\nIn this world, giants roam the land. These \"titans\" (as it's been anglicised) prey on human beings. They are brutal, violent and unstoppable. Their arrival is asmysterious as their motives. They do not eat to live. They do not eat anything else. They consume human beings and vomit them out. Humans have become worse than livestock on the food chain. At least sheep or cows are eaten for a reason. There is no discernible purpose for why the titans eat humans. They just do, and living with this fear and confusion behind the giant walls of the last known stronghold is the dwindled population of all of humanity. They've been able to keep the titans out for over a hundred years. Life in a cage, but life nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin begins with the protagonist Eren Jaeger questioning whether this kind of life is worth it. Freedom does not mean breathing boxed in, awaiting death. That's not life and he vows to use whatever power he has to fight the titans. With him is Mikasa, a girl adopted by his family, and his friend Armin. While Eren is strong-willed and rash, Mikasa is calculated and fierce and Armin is thoughtful and soft-hearted; the trio play off one another's strengths and weaknesses in order to survive. And this anime becomes a war for survival.\\n\\n\r\nEren makes for a dependable protagonist. He carries the series well, despite having some \"shounen hero\" tendencies but perhaps his enthusiasm is necessary in a world where people drop their swords and flee in the face of danger or who opt to police within the safe walls of the rich inner cities. However, Mikasa is probably the show's great hero. Powerful, naturally gifted and determined, she carries Eren whenever he falls. As he is her only family, she is terribly protective of him. She lives entirely for him, and this may seem to be the only detriment to her character, but her loyalty to him is understandable when you learn of their past. Armin will be nobody's favourite off the bat. Wimpy, small and unable to fight, he has developed his intellect instead. The other characters are well-crafted and have distinct personalities (though they are just as many \"Who's that again?\" ones as well). Some of the stand-outs are Levi, a very short, extremely experienced and talented captain, Sasha, a girl who seems to gladly choose getting punched in the face by her superiors if it means she can get a potato, Annie, who like Mikasa is very strong and capable, and Jean, a spoiled and cowardly soldier who eventually becomes someone whose growth you can possibly be proud of. It's easy to like them... but maybe it's not entirely wise.\\n\\n\r\nOne of Shingeki no Kyojin's characteristics is that nothing and nobody is safe. It is not afraid of itself. It does not shy away from brutalising its audience or characters because honestly, this is a horrible place and time to be alive. It constantly reminds you of human mortality and fragility. Some people might tell you \"don't get attached to anyone\". Sound advice, but you won't take it. The characters in this series are constructed so well that you will root for them as they pick up their swords and then cry out in disbelieving grief as you see them crushed like a mosquito. Blood and then silence. It's not entirely right to say \"nobody is safe\" as plot-immortality applies to certain characters and that is quite evident. Although the anime is going to make you doubt yourself.\\n\\n\r\nGone are the anime physics where someone can go flying into a wall and can get up without a scratch. If someone flies into a wall in this anime, that's it. Game over, man. Game over. This is no anime for children; it is a complete bloodbath. It is not afraid to show you crushed limbs, torn-away faces, stinking, steaming bones, people's necks being snapped like chickens. It doesn't shy away from letting you hear screams of people facing their last moment on earth.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's not the violence alone that will sock you hard ones to the stomach -- it's the story itself. The concepts behind what is presented and also actual events will have you reeling. The second arc of this anime more or less will have you screaming \"NO, IT CAN'T BE\". Because you simply don't want to believe what you're seeing or who it involves. The entire series will have you holding your head wondering what is going on. The characters themselves don't really know, and you share that confusion with them. Shingeki no Kyojin's story is by far one of the most creative and well-crafted in modern anime history. It has the right tone, focus and content. It develops surprisingly at every turn. This is an anime you cannot necessarily lay out a trajectory for in terms of what is going to happen. You take every episode like it is tomorrow -- you ultimately cannot know what can or will happen.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, it boasts some finely animated fight scenes, especially when the soldiers use their gear to go \"flying\" through the city. This gear is pretty inventive and can be likened to Spider-Man's web-slinging. The soldiers train to be agile and precise using this gear as it catapults them through the air. The best users of this know how to manoeuvre throughout a city block, across a titan's back or across the sky as though it were their first nature. The animation makes sure to keep you on your toes during action scenes, angling shots to keep momentum or knowing just how close to do a close-up for the best effect. The dark lines and general colourlessness of the art style keeps with the tone of the overall series. However, you can see where budgetary shortcuts were had, and while nothing to deter from the series, it is not quite perfect. Music-wise, the sound builds on the horror and the dramatic tension, and while some tracks are certainly recognisable as you watch on, they aren't entirely memorable.\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin is all about experiencing it. You can have time later to think about what's happening or to theorise, but there is no time for that in the midst of watching. There are only held breaths, churning stomachs, wide eyes and feelings of absolute horror. There are times when humanity seems to be getting somewhere, where you think, okay, there's a chance now. Hope. It exists somewhere, as small as it might be, hidden in the depths of crushing losses and corpses and city rubble. It's there, and that's what Eren and his friends will give their lives to find.",

            "content": "Oh dear Shingeki no Kyojin, where do I even begin. If you've talked with your friends about anime, then the couple anime that everyone talks about are Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and... Shingeki no Kyojin. What's the difference between Shingeki and the rest? Shingeki only has 25 episodes so far yet it's on par in popularity with the other super long, Americanized anime. Why is it popular? Well that's simply because it's stunningly amazing. Those people that call Shingeki no Kyojin \"overrated\" may not have the same taste as me, and that's perfectly fine, but in my honest opinion, Shingeki no Kyojin isone of if not the greatest anime to be made. It's not popular for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is one of the most captivating stories I've ever seen. 100 years prior to the start of the anime, humanity has been on the bridge of extinction due to the monstrous humanoid Titans that devour humans. Now, present day in the anime, the remaining small population of mankind lives confined within 3 \"heavenly\" walls that are so tall and sturdy that even the titans can't break in. The most outward wall was named, Wall Maria, the middle wall was named Wall Rose, and the most outward wall named Wall Sina. Unfortunately for mankind, a colossal titan, one that is even bigger than the 50 meter heavenly walls, breaks Wall Maria, allowing the other titans to rampage the city, thus leading to another massacre of mankind. During this massacre, our main characters, Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman watch in horror as a horrifying titan rips their mother's head off, then gobbles her up whole. Vowing that he'd one day avenge mankind and exterminate all the titans, Eren Yeager trains to become a survey corp, brave heroic soldiers who go outside the walls, into the plains in order to fight the titans. But we soon find out, that Eren is much more special than he seems, not only is he a brave warrior, but he's also something else that could be the key to humanity's survival, but could also be humanity's destruction. \\n\\n\r\nMy 3-word thoughts on the anime: Epic, Dynamic, Masterpiece. The suspense build-up was absolutely amazing, yet there was still room for improvement; that shows just how epic this anime can get. The anime not only includes epic fights, but lots of dialogue, and for those of you that hate dialogue, I feel sorry for you people whom only watch for action. The anime includes lots of other things as well: there's lots of half-hearted, hilarious scenes, as well as sad, tragic scenes. The anime certainly has a good amount of gore, and will break your heart frequently (if you get attached to the characters). Many characters end up getting gobbled up mercilessly while trying to protect humanity in ways that are quite *shivers*. Have I teared up in the anime? As a matter of fact, I have. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters was another area (alongside every area) that was Shingeki's strongpoint. There's a diverse variety of characters that fight for humanity for all different reasons. There's trust, friendship, along with betrayals, and pains. There's comedy relief among many characters, especially Sasha \"Potato Girl\" Blouse. There are characters that people can definitely relate with, such as Armin Arlert, who wants to do the right thing and protect his friends, but can't seem to do much because of fear. Fear is something that haunts us all, and prevents us from doing things in life. Another character that people can somewhat relate with is Annie Leonhardt, who fights alongside humanity, yet fights opposed to humanity. What does that mean? Watch the anime. Why is she doing this? Because of her past scars, \"scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real\" (watch to find out more). There were too many characters to development fully, but certainly the main characters were developed to their max. Levi is certainly a fan-favorite character, because of the fact that he's cool, overpowered, badass, kind-in-the-heart, smart, straight-to-the-point, and most of all, hilarious with all his neat-freakiness. The main character, Eren Yeager is strong-hearted, and \"special\", but he's still not strong enough to defeat the titans. How he develops is one of the most interesting things, in this interesting-things-packed anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and music can be described in one word: WOW! The art drawings were absolutely stunning! From the characters/titans to the setting of the story to all the equipment used in battle. The characters all had a unique aspect to them. The settings of the anime were beautiful. The cities, and walls looked realistic, the plains that characters dreamed of seeing made me want to run outside to see for myself how beautiful nature really is, and how humans under appreciate the naturality of nature. The 3-D gear was something that really caught my eye, and will certainly catch other people's eyes as well. A new form of action that's never been seen before. The characters would literally fly from rooftop to rooftop slicing their swords at the titans at high-speeds that keep the viewers eyes locked onto the screen at all times. The soundtrack in the anime was epic as shit. The openings speak for themselves, they do the anime justice. The openings were epic and certainly set the mood of what was to come from the anime. \"They're the prey, and we are the hunters!\" The rest of the soundtrack in the anime was okayasgduyasgda AMAZING. How can one describe how amazing those German OSTs were. They fit in perfectly with the epicness of the anime, and certianly added tons of suspense to the 3-D maneuver gear action. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, I may be over-thinking things, but the anime certainly included some themes while creating this masterpiece of an anime. The aspect of being confined in an area, doing the same daily routine every day. People seek to be free, and to seek adventure. Watch for this. Another theme that the anime incorporated was that of the cycle of life. Humans, we steal animals away from their families, we kill them, we eat them. What's so different from us, and the titans? The feelings of not being at the top of the food chain... Anyways, if you haven't already watched this anime and you're reading this review, then you've clearly been living under a rock all this time, and I definitely encourage you to watch this show even if it isn't your style of anime.",

            "content": "I started to follow the manga after watching the anime and quite frankly I don't see where and how the plot of Shingeki no Kyojin can suck, which in my humble opinion is awsome. You can understand the anime very well even without having read the manga. However, SNK isn't understood by many because it's a psychological manga .. SNK isn't just a succession of empty and meaningless clashes and, of uncontrolled violence, stereotyped heroes who fight the bad (like Bleach). Here are shown the darkest sides of the human psyche with great mastery: the desire to be the best but can't do it, thedifference between men, their different modes of action (just think about the speech when Eren was discovered in which they show the reactions of the inhabitants of the inner walls Rose) and their motivations, some of the questionable actions that seems to be made in the right and instead the Justice of others that superficially seems foolish and petty (such as the choice of sending refugees to rebuild the wall Mary), freedom and the fact that they don't understand that what others inculcate to us sometimes are nothing more than mental cages. We stop at the appearances only because it suits us ( the walls is a symbol of that). Omitting the main and masterfully developed theme of \"Homo omini lupus\".\\n\r\nIn this anime there are no heroes! There are not brave men, without fear, that kill all the wicked. Here there are people who are fighting against their own fear and that sometimes they make it and sometimes not. The enemies aren't the giants !Although the anime does not say from where they come from and I won't do spoilers, it's repeated several times that the enemies are the human beings with their fear (who have surrendered to the giants without doing anything, ignoring and accepting to live like cattle) and the walls! But no one notices that because it would be too challenging to make two questions and wondering: \"Why the walls ? Shouldn't they be their salvation?\" and get an answer.\\n\r\nThe fact that many people aren't well characterized, and that physically are not very different from each other isn't a coincidence .. Isayama is putting on the same level all human beings, he is saying that we are all like that guy who shoots himself alone after he surrendered to fear, that we are all as Vernam (who during the attack fled from Trost ), that there is some of us who is better than others, but that we all live under the same fears, and even if we react differently, we act according to substantially the same nature. It still tells us that we might be the protagonists of our life, choosing our destiny, but only if we are ready to go beyond the stereotypes and mindsets that others impose to us, only if only if we work with all our strength. Because living by what others tell us, from what they show us, isn't to live, but survive!\\n\r\nAnd in addition to all the various points of reflection that SNK has to offer (and there are many, not just those listed ), there is a plot full of twists and turns, the suspense. In short, it is a masterpiece. \\n\r\nThen, if you are used to an anime where the bad guys magically becomes good after a lesson or in which the characters acquire super powers from nothing or from old men who appearing in their minds... Well, ok ...... that ... that's original and profound ........\\n\r\n(Hope my english was not so bad) :)",

            "content": "In the 80's, Mobile Suit Gundam catapulted anime in Japan.\r\nIn the 90s, Dragon Ball Z broke the mainstream walls while Neon Genesis Evangelion opened the doors to the now indispensable late-night anime slots in Japan.\r\nIn the 2000s, Fullmetal Alchemist marked the peak of manga-to-anime adaptations while Code Geass & Death Note headed the class of those who introduced the new anti-hero genre.\r\nAnd now, in 2013, Attack on Titan has shaken the industry once again.\r\nUnless you've been living under a rock for the past 5 months, you should at least know what the story is about, and for the sake of staying spoiler free, I'm notgoing into details on the plot.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I wrote this review, I wrote a different piece moments after watching the first episode stating that Attack on Titan had all the potential to become a landmark anime, knowing very little of how true that statement would turn out to be.\\n\\n\r\nI have watched anime ever since I can remember. I have seen the very best and the worst that this industry has to offer. And I, like most of you, am very familiar with the relationship of manga-anime adaptation, which is the case of Attack on Titan. It is because of such experience and knowledge that I am able to say with so much confidence that Attack on Titan is the best anime series ever produced from any standpoint, at least, in the last decade.\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan is such a well-done product that it has all the key strong points we all dream every series could have. By this I mean the story, characters, animation, OST, opening/ending sequences, art, directing, narrative, character development, and, most importantly, the \"it\" factor. These are all present with \"A grade\" production values. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I want to start with the OST. Simply put, Attack on Titan's soundtrack rivals that of Rurouni Kenshin and Evangelion. Period. Don't misunderstand, they are not similar by any means, they are simply equally as masterful. Check on the internet the impressions left by fans about the first soundtrack. And if you still don't believe me, tweet Hideo Kojima (creator of Metal Gear series) and ask his take on it.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is extremely important in this show because it allows you to feel the many epic moments that dwell in this 25 episode marvel. This is where the directing and narrative play a big role. For those of you who have seen Death Note (same director), you will feel an extra feeling of similarity with Attack on Titan, as the show relies heavily on its intense emotional scenes which you most certainly will feel the first 2 minutes of episode #1. \\n\\n\r\nIt is in these scenes where the golden cast of characters shine. I cannot stress enough how unique the characters are. You could say they are the cream of the many accolades that Attack on Titan has. I'm still amazed by the quality of voice actors that just seem to just pop out in this show. The voices of so many main characters from hit series come together in Attack on Titan to help provide that epic feeling you start to get once episode #1 ends. Note I emphasize the voice acting because it's part of the anime but, obviously, not of the manga. \\n\\n\r\nAnother key strong point is the work and effort put on the OP/ED sequences. If you've come this far in my review then you most likely understand when I say that Openings and Ending sequences are crucial. They provide that extra excitement to the show. It's definitely something not all anime series take seriously. Fortunately, Wit Studio took them seriously, and then came \"Guren no Yumiya\". The second opening, \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa\" is outstanding and marvelous in its own way and the second ending, \"great escape\", fuels that adrenaline rush of excitement you will get after those killing cliffhangers. Having said that, the first OP, \"Guren no Yumiya\", is simply epic. If there was ever something to describe as epic, it would be this OP. I am certain that as of today, it is the greatest anime opening ever. I'm amazed by the amount of attention it got on the internet and the hundreds of parodies derived from it. It was simply a treat to our eyes. The song. The animation in the opening. The sync between the two. Epic. \\n\\n\r\nYou won't be skipping that opening.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, an animation production is never as close to perfection without the animation and art being top class. Now, Attack on Titan has astonishing art, to the point where you are amazed of how far animation has come. The scenes where there is sunlight will leave you speechless. The animation, unlike the other aspects, is where some disagree. The only thing I have to say is I was extremely impressed throughout the whole show until I saw a certain scene in episode #11 where the 3D maneuver gear was used, and I was stunned. I was simply stunned. Then, of course, later episodes also take it to a whole new level, but you're probably gonna be used to that quality of greatness by then.\\n\\n\r\nThat's how ridiculously good Attack on Titan is.\\n\\n\r\nNow, like the characters, the story is mostly work of the manga's author. This includes character development, which I believe is the key to the success and extreme popularity of the characters. Also, the story maybe the most original aspect of this series. Nothing you have seen before is in this show. Nothing. Much like EVA, Attack on Titan gives you a world of \"dystopia\", on-edge, and uncertainty, so full of potential that just when you think you have it figured it out, it turns around and leaves you speechless. \\n\\n\r\nOh, that will happen to you for the first time in episode #5. Guaranteed. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, even IF all these characteristics of an anime series are top notch, it won't amount to its potential if it doesn't have that \"IT\" factor. Some series have the \"IT\" factor without having all of these production values. They tend have 3 or 4 at most. Those become popular because they give out that feeling of \"amazing\". Gintama, the greatest gag series ever, comes to mind. Its anime doesn't have overwhelming OST, or eye popping animation; it does have A class characters and A class story (among others), but that \"IT\" factor takes it to another level. Now, imagine having practically everything an anime series has to offer in A class value while also having that \"IT\" factor. Extremely rare. Eva rare. FMA rare. Attack on Titan is part of that elite group. This is why its popularity rose to highs only few series reach.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first time I have ever written a detailed review of an anime series. I did it because this one deserves it. It's The anime series of my adult era. I can now relate to those anime fans who watched Evangelion almost 20 years ago. They knew they had something special, just like we do now with Attack on Titan. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Attack on Titan is, of course, like MS Gundam, DBZ, EVA, FMA, Geass, and Death Note, not perfect. Like any other piece of greatness it does have its negatives. Having said that, when you add up the good and the bad, you end up with a landmark anime series that is currently shaking the industry with its mesmerizing, sensational, emotional, intense, and inspiring first season. Just imagine the wait and the hype for season 2. \\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of effect will Attack on Titan have on the anime/manga industry we love? Only time will tell...\\n\\n\r\nIn the meantime, this is simply the best anime series in the last 15 years. Enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nExquisite beyond words.\\n\r\n101/100.",

            "content": "Every once in a while, and even more frequently now than in the past, an anime appears that is completely and unequivocally shrouded in layers upon layers of hype and popularity from the anime community. It's the show that's on everyone lips, as well as everyone's TV screens. In the Fall of 2011, The Future Diary created an exceptional level of hype that had not been seen for quite some time. When the Summer of 2012 rolled along, it was time for Sword Art Online to take the spotlight, and its own popularity grew toheights far beyond that of The Future Diary. Then, in the Spring of 2013, we were treated to what one could consider the Game of Thrones or the Breaking Bad of the anime industry in terms of sheer popularity; a show that completed engulfed the entire anime community, dwarfing even SAO in popularity, but is this anime truly worthy of the hype that it received?\\n\\n\r\n          Our story is set in an alternate universe where, 100 years prior to the events of the story, giant humanoid creatures known as Titans appeared and began consuming and decimating the human population, though with no apparent purpose for doing so. In response, the remainder of humanity built three enormous, circular walls to encompass their entire population and keep the Titans at bay. In this world, we meet three young children Eren Yeager, his adopted sister Mikasa, and their friend Armin, as they live out their peaceful lives in the southernmost city at the edge of the outer wall, Wall Maria. This soon changes, however, when a 60-meter Titan smashes through the main gate of Wall Maria, allowing Titans to freely enter the city and devour every human in sight, and forcing those who lived in the outer districts to retreat behind Wall Rose. During the chaos, Eren witnesses his mother being eaten by a Titan, and now he, Mikasa, and Armin have joined the military in the hopes of acquiring the skills necessary to take vengeance on the creatures that destroyed their lives.\\n\\n\r\n          This series, as a whole, has almost completely mastered the art of building suspense, mostly through the use of very long plot arcs. There always seems to be something constantly pushing towards a conclusion, but not actually getting there until several episode later, and that push factor creates a sensation of rarely ever wanting to stop watching for fear of the resolution being just after the episode you just watched. Additionally, this series is also a master of what I call the \"morale builder,\" something that Gurren Lagann has shown mastery of in the past, and there are dozens of moments throughout the series where, no matter how grim and horrifying the situation, it provides an uplifting or rallying feeling that both immerses you in the world its sets up and makes you root for our heroes to the bitter end.\\n\\n\r\n          Speaking of grim and horrifying, that comparison to Game of Thrones earlier was far from being an off-handed comment. By this I mean that I hope you don't enjoy getting attached to characters, like I do, as you may find yourself curled up in a corner at some point. In the world of fiction, particularly in action series, there is a concept called \"plot armor,\" which basically means that characters who seem crucial to the plot's progression and the show's stability as a whole are protected from death or other nasty fates that might await them. In this regard, the plot armor for Attack on Titan is about as thick as a used piece of tin foil, and deaths of major characters are frequent and often times unrelenting. In regards to this, and on a more personal note, there are only three anime that have actually made me legitimately cry before. Two of them were KyoAni series, and the third was Attack on Titan. This show really does not care about who your favorite character is, and if you've made it this far without having had the major deaths in the series spoiled for you yet, then consider yourself lucky.\\n\\n\r\n          Unfortunately, there is one minor flaw with this series. There are certain points, especially at some slightly slower moments in the series, where its gets a little too over-dramatic, to the point of almost being ridiculous. This was especially noticeable during what is now referred to as the \"Boulder Arc,\" which encompasses roughly episodes 10-12. These moments are few and far between however, and are immediately drowned out once the hype builds back up again.\\n\\n\r\n          On the character front, for the sake of not getting your hopes up about the prospects of certain characters living, I'll talk only about the three main characters I mentioned earlier, with the knowledge that the rest of the cast, while incredibly massive in scale, still serves as a stellar group of vibrant personalities and ideals to create a surprisingly organic social environment. As for the big three, we'll start with Armin, who takes on the \"smart one/strategist\" archetype. While he is fairly generic and standard at the beginning of the series, we get to see him grow into being a more varied character at a constantly shifting rate, and his skills at strategy both on the battlefield and in complex conversations are practically unmatched, often allowing him the power to save the other two from the situations they get themselves into.\\n\\n\r\n          Next is Mikasa, who, for the majority of the series, is portrayed as being essentially flawless, taking on the role of the unstoppable badass Titan slayer fresh out of training who also makes time to coddle her adoptive brother, and this flawlessness is built up to the point of it almost being a flaw in itself. There are, however, a few quirks to her personality that make her feel more human, but at the same time make her seem even more distant. Her only notable \"flaw\" seems to be her undying loyalty and devotion to Eren, often throwing caution to the wind and bolting out against orders in order to make sure he's safe. This also leads to some rather disquieting moments where her own sanity seems to abandon her and, to put it lightly, causes her to act excessively hostile towards anyone who means ill will towards Eren.\\n\\n\r\n          Finally, we have Eren, our stereotypical \"perseverance\" character whose sole motivation for the majority of the season is taking revenge on the Titans, and while this does seem like a bit of a gaping flaw for the show's main character, it's actually both understandable and sort of refreshing. His intense focus on his own rage and desires for revenge slowly consumes part of who he is, which becomes especially present at several points throughout the series that I can't go further into detail on due to massive amounts of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\n         The animation was produced by Wit Studios, a new studio that serves as a surrogate of Production I.G. Regardless of its heritage, for a new studio to create such a massively impressive project is beyond incredible. Not only is the animation well-polished, but it also carries its own distinctive style, most notably in the fact that its characters are heavily outlined in varying thicknesses of black to make them pop out from the background. Speaking of backgrounds, the environments are shown to be incredibly rich and detailed despite how unvaried they may appear on the surface, and the action shots give us plenty of different perspectives on this environment. As for the action itself, Wit Studios has no qualms at all with handing out incredible fight sequences by the barrel-full via an in-world tool used by humanity's military known as 3D Maneuver Gear, allowing us to break away from standard ground combat and enter the world of high-flying intensity, with soldiers bolting off of every building in sight, into the air above them, and landing blade-first on the neck of a Titan. On course, all of these brilliant combinations of animation are to be expected from Araki, who has already brought us both the intensely stylized atmosphere of Death Note and the blood-pumping action of Guilty Crown.\\n\\n\r\n         The dub was produced by FUNimation, and, as someone who watched the subbed version first, I have no problems whatsoever recommending this dub. From heavy-hitting new favorites like Josh Grelle and Matthew Mercer to classic icons like Vic Mignogna and Caitlin Glass, Funimation has pulled out all the stop to create one of the best dubs this side of 2010. Grelle shuffles between nervously unstable and frantically stern for his portrayal as Armin, and Trina Nishimura pulls off both Mikasa's warmth and ferocity to near perfection. My only notable flaw with the dub is Bryce Papenbrook as Eren. To be fair, this is definitely Papenbrook's best performance yet, due in no small part to Mike McFarland's exceptional voice directing, but he does still tend to get a bit \"Bryce-y\" at some points and lets his excessively angsty style boil over, which is a rather dangerous idea considering Eren's character. Overall though, this is a minor blemish on an otherwise excellent dub.\\n\\n\r\n         The music was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano (Aldnoah.Zero, Kill la Kill), and this soundtrack is definitely one of the best to come out of anime in a long time, based in heavy orchestrations and laced throughout with electronica and hard rock. From the bombastic explosions of \"E.M.A\" and main theme \"Attack on Titan\" to the insert tracks of \"The Reluctant Heroes\" and \"Doa,\" this soundtrack dabbles in the art of perfection on all fronts. If it seems like I'm being much more in-depth with the soundtrack than usual, it's because I've actually purchased the soundtrack on iTunes and have been listening to it practically non-stop, and I highly recommend making this purchase as well. Both opening themes, \"Guren no Yumiya\" and \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa,\" were performed by Linked Horizon and give us massive eruptions of heavy rock combined with brass and vocal choirs (and on a quick aside, I'm one of the few people that actually preferred the second theme more than the first, though the first still kicks all sorts of ass). The first ending theme \"Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai\" by Yoko Hikasa gives us a rolling ballad to play us out of each episode, while the second ending theme \"great escape\" by Cinema Staff blasts through with a heavy rock track. Additionally, all of these tracks except \"great escape\" are available for purchase on iTunes, purchases that I also highly recommend.\\n\\n\r\n         Overall, Attack on Titan is simply an incredible experience, combining high-flying action that could even make ufotable nervous with a dark and nearly-overwhelming sense of fear and desperation, and this anime is more than deserving of the hype that it receives. However, as it stands right now, on November 4, 2014, the series is incomplete, and there has been no announcement of a second season yet. I highly doubt that this second season will never come however, and it has been reported that the original manga is planned to be finished in about four years\u2019 time (which actually isn't that much material for a monthly manga). In the meantime, there will be plenty of specials and spin-offs to keep us satiated until season 2 is officially announced.\\n\\n\r\n          Attack on Titan is currently licensed by FUNimation and is available from them for both streaming and purchase.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin... Where do I start?\r\nIn summary, Shingeki no Kyojin is a perfect anime to get somebody who loves action started on anime- I think it is literally the most mainstream anime ever made, and that is definitely not a bad thing. But with this comes downsides- ones not apparent to the viewer at first glance, but looking back on it after watching it around the time it first came out, definitely shine through.\r\nShingeki no Kyojin starts off with a roar- the first 2 episodes explode right out of the gate with high-octane action that also leaves mystery to draw the viewer in. Whoare the titans? What is in the basement? Why is Eren's dad so creepy? All this and more the viewer asks themselves as the end credits roll for episode 2.\\n\\n\r\nThen episode 3 and 4 jump in. It's a training scene for Eren and his friends, and it's dead slow in comparison. But that's ok- it's episodes like this that reinforce character development and get the plot rolling. And soon, the episodes with action will begin again, right? That High-Octane, bloody, gory action we've all been waiting for!\\n\\n\r\nWell, it does. But then shortly after, it grinds back to a halt. Why do I bring up the first 5 episodes out of all things to mention about Shingeki no Kyojin? Because it perfectly frames the pacing of the entire anime. First you're baited with that sweet, bloody action that makes you just stare at the screen in amazement of the beautiful animation and heart-pumping soundtrack, and next thing you know you have to sit through an hour of people arguing over the same issue over and over before going back to the action. This would be fine and acceptable if it actually resulted in plot and character development going somewhere- but rarely this bickering between Armin and Eren result in anything productive.\\n\\n\r\nActually, Shingeki no Kyojin seems to show perfectly how to pull off the ILLUSION of plot and character development- Eren struggling with his inner demons despite somehow going back to square 1 every 5 episodes, the Basement which has been explicitly mentioned as having \"all the answers\" being completely forgotten about while the group goes out to hunt titans, and Armin rehashing what we already know to other characters every episode or two. All of this combined create a huge mess that on first glance seems like a deep and interesting story, but only through reflection of a different lens you begin to notice how shallow the pool you're standing in really is. The characters are shallow, the story tries to go somewhere but the characters almost seem to prevent it from moving at all, and at some points the story tries to go to too many places at once, just confusing the viewer until the next trippy action scene kicks in.\\n\\n\r\nI like to compare Shingeki no Kyojin to a Michael Bay film. This also makes it easier to understand what I'm trying to say (and trust me, it's not your fault- I have a hard time expressing what I feel in words sometimes).\\n\\n\r\nImagine Eren as Shia Labeouf, and Shingeki no Kyojin as a typical summer blockbuster by Michael Bay. Eren zips around the scenes of the movie, fighting bad-guys and pulling off amazing stunts with beautifully rendered graphics and an amazing ost- but then hardcut to Eren getting mad at himself and people around him but not actually advancing the plot for 1/3rd of the movie as the action grinds to a halt. Add some comedic relief (if you want a Bay comparison, the classic transformers out of place masturbation joke fits well) including possibly some potatoes after a traumatic scene and then slap on the illusion of having a deep plot and you have Shingeki no Kyojin. It's a typical summer blockbuster! You go in, watch it, enjoy it, then leave and forget about it! I'm really not saying you're not allowed to enjoy it because it's shallow and noisy, I'm just saying you shouldn't walk in expecting a revolutionary masterpiece of anime- which is what some critics are raising it up to be.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY- 4 : The story's foundations are put up well, but the actual progression falls flat as no questions are ever really answered and the plot never seems to want to go in a single direction.\\n\r\nART- 9 : The art is amazing! There are some worse-off scenes and some animation glitches, but the art is one of the things that makes Shingeki no Kyojin stand out from the crowd. Even though I am not a huge fan of the anime itself, I have a massive poster above my computer of it as we speak.\\n\r\nSOUND- 10 : While the music and sound design is generic at worst, it is composed beautifully and always reinforces the mood set out by the show. I would highly recommend a download of the OST.\\n\r\nCHARACTER- 3 : Easily the worst part of Shingeki no Kyojin. Eren's constant back and forth attitude and behaviour that never goes anywhere, Armin's arguing with people that last an entire episode simply to recap what just happened on screen, Mikasa's constant fight to try and save everyone and pull everything together: it's just all poorly done.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- 6 : While watching Shingeki no Kyojin, I certainly enjoyed it- but I wouldn't say I enjoyed it the whole way through. Even while watching it, I noticed a lot of the fighting and arguing was going on too long, and let's not forget the 3-5 episodes of riding on horses. But the scenes that were enjoyable- notably the fight scenes and the pivotal plot twists certainly left a lot to talk about and were enjoyable enough to at least somewhat wipe away two annoying characters yelling at eachother on horses for 30 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 5: Watch it, get what you get out of it, but don't walk in expecting the next amazing revolutionary anime. Expect a summer blockbuster.",

            "content": "Attack on Titan is a particularly unique case for me. As such, my review needs to be broken up to properly analyze it. \r\nStory: \r\nAttack on Titan has an absolutely astounding setting. The sheer idea behind the setting, the exposition pieces, and the initial plot elements held the potential for it to be one of the best action anime ever. From the first three episodes, I could see how someone could believe this would be that one anime that is just absolutely amazing. It simply becomes disappointing as things continue. Long story short? The start is absolutely amazing. It's powerful. It's grabbing. It does everythingan introduction should do. The problem after that stems from the plot slowly becoming painfully predictable and a personal dissatisfaction with the protagonists in place as well as the decisions of various members of the cast completely destroying the story's credibility at times. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nArt is completely subjective. I would not actually judge art based on someone's own opinion. You would really have to see it for yourself to deem whether it is \"good\" or not. As for me, it seemed fairly mediocre. The effort is there, but something with the art style simply does not jive with me. The settings are well done, but the characters are quite bland. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nFinally. This is what I can praise Attack on Titan for. If anything, this series's soundtrack deserves to be remembered. It is excellent and its execution throughout the anime was not only strategic but tasteful. The tracks range from dark and depressing to powerful and moving pieces designed for a battle against a completely hopeless situation. In my opinion, the music in and of itself is the true beauty behind this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist Eren Jeager is heavily set on his goal to a fault. Some call this good writing, but given the setting, it actually works against the story and its credibility. It is literally almost difficult to not find the main character's obsession with revenge nostalgic and downright hilarious. If you don't like avenger-type characters, you will despise Eren beyond imagination by the time the story is over. The worst part? He finally starts developing three-quarters through and goes right back to the bratty child he was in the first few eps. The same can be said of Mikasa. This anime is one of the few to portray women with some form of decency, but Mikasa's obsession with Eren is a pretty sad window of how the author wants people to worship his poorly-designed protagonist. To boot, Mikasa literally has no flaws other than her obsession with Eren. No character flaws. No ability flaws. Her only real flaw is her obsession with Eren, which usually only winds up helping them, not causing them problems like it should. Your only real likable protagonist? Armin. He is one of maybe three characters we really see that has a solid character, solid flaws, and solid development based on those flaws and his interactions with other characters due to the plot. In all honesty, Armin should have been the main protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nNow we move onto enjoyment. Despite vehemently despising roughly eighty-five percent of the cast, I enjoyed Attack on Titan. Is it a great action anime? Sure. Definitely! Is it realistic? Sad to say, but no it is not. Is it the most well-written anime ever? Astronomically far from it. If you're looking for an action anime to sit down and enjoy, this is a wonderful choice. If you're looking for an action anime with a strong plot and emphasis on lovable characters, I recommend pretending that you never heard the hype and staying far away from this anime. \\n\\n\r\nWith a heavy heart, I cannot give the anime anything higher than a 5/10 in good conscience. It had oodles of potential, but an irritating cast, some half-baked plot elements, and predictability ruined it. Mediocre at best.",

            "content": "I started watching Shingeki no Kyojin a year ago, almost to the day that I am writing this. So I figured I would write a review on what has grown to be one of my favourite series of all time.\r\nWhat I've noticed is that people tend to be very split about this anime; you either love it, or you hate it. Clearly, in my case, I love this entire series (the show, the manga, the side-stories, etc.) Now onto the actual review.\r\nStory: 9\r\nAt its core, Shingeki no Kyojin is something that we have seen many times in the past: humanity is being attacked, therefore wemust defend ourselves. Many, many iconic shows start from this format. However, SNK (as I will be calling it for the rest of the review) takes this simple plot point and expands it into something very, very unique. We have the Titans: giant, humanoid creatures set on devouring humans. Because of the Titans, humanity has been driven behind three walls, with the population dwindling to less than 1% of our current population. \\n\\n\r\nEach and every single plot point in this series is completely thought out and executed stunningly. There are so many twists that you won't be able to see coming. Hell, check out episode 8- you'll be shocked. Even the filler is thought out, and has important significance to the main story. The story of SNK goes even further in the manga. At the time of writing this review, there has been 59 chapters released, and we are just only starting to scratch the surface of this world.\\n\\n\r\nLike most things out there, SNK does have its flaws. But the flaws are so minuscule that it's very, very hard to notice them. The brilliant storytelling of this series completely blew me away from episode 1, which is why it deserves a near perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIf you have read the SNK manga, you'll know that the art, while it is good, isn't amazing. The anime cleaned up all of the character designs, leaving us with a beautiful result. While there were some minor changes in characters (ex Eren's eye colour, Levi's physique, etc,) the anime designs did stay pretty true to the original material. The designs match the characters' personalities completely, which is something that not a lot of shows can brag about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the animation is breathtaking. Every single sky we see, the birds eye views; the scenery in this anime is absolutely stunning. And the animation for the characters and their situations is pretty great, too. To me, this is digital animation to the finest degree. But again, as is the case with most shows, SNK does have some animation flaws. For example, in one episode, the same frame is shown about three times. The characters can also have a case of \"far away face\", but that is pretty common. Again, these flaws in animation are pretty small, and are barely noticeable when you are watching the show. They do not take away from the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe score for SNK was done by Hiroyuki Sawano. If you don't recognize his name, he also composed the score for things like Kill la Kill, Ao no Exorcist, and more recently Aldnoah.Zero. If I could use any one word to describe the sound of SNK, it would be flawless. The score matches every scene perfectly, mixing electronics with more orchestral pieces. If you don't have any interest in watching the show, I would still suggest you download the OSTs. The sound for this show blew me away. Even the background noises, the additional sound FX- they were all done to the utmost perfection.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings for SNK were all absolutely amazing. It's no wonder that Guren no Yumiya in particular has landed on many \"top 10 anime openings\" lists. The songs will get stuck in your head, and refuse to leave. In my case, they have not left in a year, and that's something that is very hard to do in my case. Just check out the OPs and EDs online; you'll be amazed at how great they are.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the voice acting is nothing to laugh at, either. With many shows that I've seen, I've noticed that the voices don't match with the characters. Either the voice is too weak, too bold, meek, etc- this is not the case with SNK. Each character is voiced perfectly; each voice matches the personality of the character. The passion put into the voice acting of the show is nothing to laugh at. The voice actors were able to portray each and every line and emotion perfectly, which is something very hard to do. The dub is a different story (but we don't talk about the dub....)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis is where most people decided whether they love or hate this show. To be fair, the characters in SNK can sometimes seem a little extreme with their personalities. However, I love them. For example, the main character Eren can seem very angry, very passionate. Some people hate this. They think he's just a trope amped up to the extreme. In my opinion, Eren's character was done perfectly. His \"extreme\" emotions fit his personality up to a T. \\n\\n\r\nThe personalities of each character in this show are fleshed out near perfectly, in my opinion. Again, some aspects can seem extreme, but that is part of the enjoyment of this series. Not one character is deemed as \"perfect.\" They each have their flaws, which makes them seem very human and realistic. As the story goes on, each point in each characters' personality is explained in detail, even if it seems unimportant initially.\\n\\n\r\nEach character in this series serves a purpose. The main characters, the main supporting characters, the regular supporting characters- each and every one of them is important. There is a lot of death in this show, but every single death we see is important to the story and the character development. And while some deaths may seem insignificant, they really aren't. The entire emotional journey of this series stems from the characters, and SNK has pretty powerful ones.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of blood and gore. Really, I'm not. There have been several shows, live-action or animated, that I have had to drop because of their content. When a show like SNK, which has copious amounts of both blood and gore, can become one of my favourites, you know that it is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single episode of SNK had me captivated. Even the filler ones. Each and every episode was an emotional journey from start to finish. Waiting for the episodes to air every week was torture, because I so desperately wanted to see everything happen (even if I had already read the manga.) I loved every single episode, even the OVAs that have been released. Each release had me on edge, with both the show and the manga. Nothing was dull; everything was riveting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThere is a reason why this show doesn't score perfect. It has its flaws, as everything does. But there is also a reason why it scores so high.\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin was one of the most popular, if not the MOST popular anime of 2013. There is a reason for this. There is a reason why so many people watch, read, and enjoy this series, even if they're not into anime or manga. There is a reason why there are copious amounts of fan works for this series. There is a reason why so much merchandise has been released. There is a reason why so many people cosplay characters from this series.\\n\\n\r\nLike it or hate it, you really can't deny how popular it is. I personally love everything about it. Keep in mind that this is only my opinion; other people will tell you different things. But to me, Shingeki no Kyojin is stunning.",

            "content": "Let's get straight to it! Shingeki no Kyojin is an incredibly gripping, action packed show, and it is certainly capable of converting non-anime watchers. When you begin to understand the plight of humanity versus the titans, you'll quickly begin to realize that this is a show of epic proportions - essentially it is an inter species war: and violence comes hand in hand with this theme, so squeamish viewers might want to look elsewhere.\r\nThe show is incredibly engaging, and intense because the combat animations are executed perfectly, giving a really personal front row seat throughout. Not only this but peril is constantly a reinforced aspectof the anime, and what's scarier is the accurate scale of death that isn't afraid to engulf those that the viewer has become connected to.\\n\\n\r\nI'm liking this logical order, because with death brings me to the next area i'd like to explain: Drama! Oh boy you'll be astounded by the dramatic, emotional and often angry outbursts of the characters. I personally would rank Shingeki no Kyojin highly in all of its presentation methods.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not all, because in addition to being well presented, violent and dramatic, the show still then has the drive to steer you into corners via breakthroughs in the story. Another beautiful aspect of the show is that although the context would say that humanity had been surviving for over a century, the titans are still a great mystery to the present characters, therefore putting you (the viewer) on the front line for discovering more!\\n\\n\r\nDespite how i'm in awe with so many parts of the anime, the story if i'm honest is a bit too linear, as in i don't think enough goes on behind the scenes of titan combat. The plot summary introductions are also a pain due to their repetitiveness, it really is easy to pick up the story line behind the show, yet to an extent where it almost feels like it's been dumbed down.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, i agree with the masses, this popular anime lives up to its reputation, and you really must see for yourself!",

What have I done?\r\nHow am I not able to feel the stun?...\r\nI will write about \"Attack on Titan\" here;\r\nbut yeah, I'm no fanboy trying to endear\r\nmyself to mainstream now or in the longer run.\r\nI turned towards this show unbiased\r\nconsidering its popularity at highest.\r\nI wanted to see if this action show at least\r\nconveys more meanings than being a bloody feast.\r\nBut in the end: people and story at its driest.\r\nSo hundreds of years ago, the humankind\r\nis letting itself be completely confined\r\nby dim-witted looking titans there\r\ninside a 50-meter wall ensnare\r\nand is now searching for ways to get behind.\r\nThen suddenly, a 60-meter giant attacks\r\nand manymore titans are making their tracks.\\n\r\nThe wall can't hold it anymore\\n\r\nand so the humans are fighting another war.\\n\r\nTheir enemies won't give them more time to relax!\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes are quite intense,\\n\r\nexperiencing human's crumbling defence,\\n\r\ngetting their normal lives torn up again,\\n\r\nhaving to survive in a diminishing den,\\n\r\nand nearly losing their last kind of sense.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow Eren, who has to sustain\\n\r\nhis mother's loss, indeed a great pain.\\n\r\nHe wants to kick some titan's ass\\n\r\nand finally falls into the shounen mass,\\n\r\nalways acting like tightened by an angry chain.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanied by one of the few\\n\r\nmore normal humans, Mikasa, whose true\\n\r\nintention is to save her Eren\\n\r\nand so she's getting ears more barren\\n\r\ndespite her strength she would rather sue.\\n\\n\r\nThe third in league, weak fair-haired Armin, stays\\n\r\nthe cowardly one with a frightened face.\\n\r\nHe tends to think far more than others\\n\r\nbut is mostly hindering his brothers.\\n\r\nHe needs lots of time to realise his place.\\n\\n\r\nSo maybe you would think that some other\\n\r\nguys inside these walls don't try to bother,\\n\r\nbut instead act more heroic inside this hell.\\n\r\nYou see, Commander Levi's the only one memorable;\\n\r\nhe wouldn't even trade his tenacity for his mother.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, these characters just won't try\\n\r\nto develop properly and we ask why?\\n\r\nWhy haven't they used episodes five to twelve\\n\r\nto let them build some features or delve\\n\r\ninto their motivations or what they go by?\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, you won't remember any other names.\\n\r\nThey die like flies and only the main remains.\\n\r\nSo I really wondered the whole time where\\n\r\nthe more seasoned soldiers would deign to dare\\n\r\nto get into the fight, but you know what it claims...\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, the probably most important thing:\\n\r\nWhat are the titans? Ruled by a king?\\n\r\nWhat are their bloody true intentions?\\n\r\nHinder humanity from some kind of interventions?\\n\r\nWe aren't informed, and that's a serious sting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the style and art does kind of save all it\\n\r\nfrom falling into a much more deeper pit.\\n\r\nDetailed architecture and nice quality,\\n\r\nalthough the animations strive for equality,\\n\r\nbut the art got me astounded, I must admit!\\n\\n\r\nWhat you will hear is mostly amazing.\\n\r\nThe music improves the already fast pacing\\n\r\nbut cannot reach my most favourite sides\\n\r\nlike Code Geass with \"Stories\" provides.\\n\r\nSo it's epic, and rather the common saving.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention for an awesome opening theme\\n\r\nmixing German and Japanese for deserved esteem.\\n\r\nIt conveys this rather intimidating mood,\\n\r\nlets us taste of the upcoming action food.\\n\r\nBelieving the whole show's that epic: it stays a dream.\\n\\n\r\nNow summarizing art and sound: they're nice;\\n\r\nbut paying with a decent story at least twice.\\n\r\nMan, there are so many episodes for fill,\\n\r\nthe pacing is off, the direction needs skill,\\n\r\ninferring that eight episodes clearly would suffice.\\n\\n\r\nSome people will ask how I can say\\n\r\nthis show is average and carried away...\\n\r\nIt has nothing like a memorable plot\\n\r\nand tends to dramatize quite a lot,\\n\r\njust not worth for every fan to stay!\\n\\n\r\nI can't deny the certain amount of joy\\n\r\nthe first few episodes deliver, oh boy!\\n\r\nBut after that, it's nothing new...\\n\r\nNo inspirations I aim to pursue...\\n\r\nIts part to perplex hardly evens the one to annoy.\\n\\n\r\nSo this practically concludes my review.\\n\r\n\"Do not believe the hype\" became so true!\\n\r\nIf you like some standard action shows,\\n\r\nthen Attack on Titan doesn't have much to oppose,\\n\r\nbut otherwise it isn't worth any ballyhoo.",

            "content": "This anime made my mouth open wide for longer than 5 seconds more than a handful times. This is the type of world where more people get killed than the entirety of the A Song of Ice and Fire series. It exists in a timeless universe \u2013 not in the past, present or future of our world, but in a pocket universe where Titans existed long before the existence of machines. In this world, machines were not invented to improve humanity\u2019s lifestyle, but for the continuous existence of humanity itself.\r\nThere\u2019s lots of shouting (especially from Eren), lots of action, lots of character development, and lotsof tears. My friends weren\u2019t kidding. I felt like my ear drums would break from all the intense shouting. I think my mind is forever scarred, what with how everyone got crushed like ants all the time. And my heart has become immune to all other fictional deaths, what with all the deaths I\u2019ve experienced just from this show alone.\\n\\n\r\nIt teaches you a lot about what it takes to be a soldier, a survivor. Constantly, people have to be reminded to \u201cFIGHT!\u201d Some lines are repeated all over the anime that it kind of becomes engraved into your head and heart once you\u2019re done with it.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the kind of anime that sticks with you, the kind that leaves you with phantom faces with phantom voices following you around, making you feel as if you\u2019re still living in that universe, even after you\u2019ve told yourself that you\u2019re done with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of the villain, and of the world itself, is scary and genius. First off, the villain \u2013 the Titan \u2013 is basically a stupid giant human cannibal.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike other villains, it doesn\u2019t want revenge. It doesn\u2019t want world domination. It doesn\u2019t want power. It doesn\u2019t need to eat. It has lived a hundred years without eating humans. But it is all it ever eats. It doesn\u2019t eat animals. It wants only one thing \u2013 and this is just a theory, but it\u2019s one that I can side with, and one that I love the most \u2013 to annihilate the existence of humanity.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the fact that it looks human. It is, in every aspect, a human being, except for the fact that it doesn\u2019t have two things; sexual organs, and a conscience. Countless times, characters had their feet rooted to the ground, unable to fight, and I think it\u2019s because the image of a gigantic human biting off a human\u2019s neck is just too fascinatingly cruel that they feel they cannot look away.\\n\\n\r\nThe world itself is scarier than the world of the Hunger Games. And I think what makes it scary is the fact that humanity has never won against the Titans, ever. For the past who-knows-how-many-years, Titans have been eating humans.\\n\\n\r\nThe humans in this world pretend that they have a system.\\n\\n\r\no matter what plan the humans think of, no matter how determined every single one of their skilled soldiers are, they will still be crushed in less than a second without remorse, without even a body to prove that you have existed. This is their anarchy, their \u2018chaos\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single man, woman and child in this world lived with losing a loved one as a social norm. It\u2019s a dark fact I\u2019d like everyone to consider. Everyone is already dead, in everyone else\u2019s eyes. That\u2019s what\u2019s sad about this whole thing \u2013 even the humans think of other humans as just tiny insects with no importance. But it\u2019s also beautiful, because sometimes, sometimes a character sees through that corrupted notion and calls everyone else out on it, making us realize it along the way too.\\n\\n\r\nSo you have a dark world, and an even darker society. Combine that with real-life everyday problems like corruption in the system, hierarchy in social status, differences in privileges and human rights and what do you get? Awesome badass characters who naiively try to fight against it.\\n\\n\r\nThe differences in character personality is great, too. There are a few who are extremely righteous, but most of them just really don\u2019t care. They feign an act of indifference, but all for different reasons. But the fact that they had grieved over the death of a loved one united them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I think that\u2019s brilliant. These clashes of personality, and this unity for one tragedy, has bonded them together, and changed them greatly. You get to see how much they have grown in a span of 5-7 years. That\u2019s something I don\u2019t usually see in anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou also get to witness the amazing 3D Maneuver Gear.\\n\\n\r\nThis made the whole world look kind of sci-fi, but also, kind of not. The 3D Maneuver Gears are as close as we can get to a \u2018high tech\u2019 fictional gadget in this world. Every other man made thing you see in the anime is pretty mundane. But the function of it makes the people actually fly. It\u2019s a pretty brilliant concept, and I like how something as complicated as that is a seemingly-ordinary thing for them. Plus, it makes the animation really cool to watch. You gotta respect the amount of effort (and physics, I bet) put just to make sure each maneuver looks even just a little legit.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is amazing, too. There were some points where I gaped like a fish because \u201cwHaT just happened omg\u201d and the music dramatically intensified my feelings. So kudos to that! The animation was splendid, hands down. Especially, like I said, with the whole 3D Maneuver thing.",

            "content": "The hype of 2013 leading to an ending that closed off lots of action and questions throughout its run. With an anime that has a lot of hype, comes a lot of conflict between haters and people who genuine enjoy the anime. Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime that made peaks in sales and getting fans world wide, but is it really worth watching? \r\nThe concept of humanity being at the brink of extinction, this is one emphasizes it's fight for survival and the ups and downs of their fight for victory. With the first episode starting off with a great clincher to get youexcited for the rest of series, you get a little view of how each character is and their view point towards the situation. \\n\\n\r\nDue to the story of humans being driven to extinction, you often get an anime that can be a hit or a miss depending on how they unravel it throughout the series. Humans are declining with titans appearing onto earth and they eventually make a wall tall enough to the point where even the tallest titan can't break through. \\n\\n\r\nWith the show being a fight for survival, it does an excellent job actually dragging out the battle to its actual length. With anime these days battle scenes are usually only an episode with the exception of it being mostly dialog. Attack on Titan has arcs of each fight against the titans or progress in the story. You're given arcs that focus on a battle to take back a city, an expedition outside the walls, and even a battle taking place inside their safest town. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime you get stories of some characters past and they're definitely something that makes each character enjoyable and much more interesting to watch as the series progresses forward. The characters are mainly focuses on Eren, Mikasa and Armin. They're what drives the story and is the foundation for all the events that happen.\\n\\n\r\nYou have the main character Eren, a boy who does before he thinks. This often gets him into a lot of fights and is what drives his friends to do more than they expect they can do. With his mother being eaten in front of him, you get a lot of realism towards his feelings to the situation and an actual reason for his hate rather than the generic hero title.\\n\\n\r\nSecond you have Mikasa, a girl who is brave and does anything to protect Eren. They're not related, but they're brother and step-sister, but act just like siblings. They bicker and often get into fights due to different feelings  and agreements. She's usually level-headed and very mature, but you'll see when something happens to Eren, she breaks down and becomes very agitated. \\n\\n\r\nLastly you have Armin, hes the brains of the group and emotional support for both of them. While lacking in physical strength he excels in strategy and decision making. While not being the main focus of the anime, he's probably the character with the most development. At the start hes weak and afraid, but towards the end he becomes mentally strong and definitely a changed person due to the events that occur to him and his friends.\\n\\n\r\nWith anime being military themed, you're given characters who are joined in with them due to squads and become their friends. You have characters who disagree with a lot of what they do, and some that are just like them and get along well. The side characters are also important for what happens and really drive the story with their back stories and talent that they bring to the group.\\n\\n\r\nKnown for having excellent art, I have nothing to say that can disagree with that. The art through the entire anime stays at top quality and even has detail in every aspect of the show. With all the scenery being changed constantly through the battles, you see buildings that were once standing being ruined and detail in everything. You can see the emotion on all of the characters faces as they witness their comrades being eaten alive. \\n\\n\r\nThe scenery seems to be staged in what seems like Europe, you see a lot of forests and old-style buildings. With all the scene changes you can see detail in everything such as trees, buildings and even the clothes that the characters wear. It makes it feel like the Middle Ages or so, with the wool and texture the clothes has.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to the theme of extiction, you get 2 wonderful openings to hype you for the anime. With the first half being set around emphasizing their survival, you get an opening that has lots of action and despair to give the feeling of struggle the characters are going through. The second half is more towards the counter attack that mankind has and their subtle victories and their path towards winning against the titans. The opening gives that feeling of excitement and shows their steps to becoming closer to surviving and prospering once again. With battles happening constantly and emotion going across the board with characters dying, or even victory, you get excellent background music to support those feelings even more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is something that lives up to its hype and does a good job having a really serious tone, but also giving off some comedy to balance it out. The story is something that has been done often, but this is one that emphasizes humanities survival. The art is top quality and is the best of the 2013 season to make every battle scene beautiful and movements very clean. The characters were all really well developed and really makes the viewer sad when they die, even though they've only just been introduced a few episodes ago. Anyone who enjoys an action or looking for a great anime to pass time, this is definitely worth checking out.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin is an amazingly written story with a very dark premise and a lot of action. This is definitely not a series for the faint of heart, especially those with fears of man-eating giants that don't even have the decency to kill you before they eat you (sometimes). The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, there's a new reveal that completely destroys what you thought you knew and makes you wonder just how far the rabbit hole goes. The characters are very relatable and you really do want to see them succeed. What makes this series unique however is the protagonists veryrarely ever win a battle. Every mission the cast engage in usually ends in a blood bath, but it's not without purpose. The gruesome deaths we witness just cements how high the stakes are in this story, and the determination of the protagonists to push forward is very inspiring.\\n\r\nAnother unique thing about the cast is they are rather three-dimensional in comparison to a lot of anime and manga I've seen. Where I expect some characters to be completely flat jerkasses or emotionless bastards, there's always something that really makes you like them. The series also makes a point of establishing that no matter what you see on the outside, the characters certainly feel and act human deep down. This makes it really heart breaking when you see characters you like die in the line of duty, and only makes you want to see the good guys succeed all the more, which serves to make their victories so much sweeter.\\n\r\ntl;dr, This series is a must-read/watch. If you have a weak stomach or a phobia for cannibalistic slasher smiles, give it a miss. Otherwise, give it your full attention.",

            "content": "If you\u2019re an anime or manga patron, you\u2019ve more than likely heard of, if you haven\u2019t already read or seen, a series entitled Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan). Based on the popular manga, Shingeki no Kyojin had been made into an anime in 2013, that had literally taken the entire world by storm. It's even been airing on American Television alongside other popular shows such as One Piece and Naruto. It\u2019s popularity is getting to the point where it\u2019s damn near impossible to say the word \u201canime\u201d without someone bringing up Shingeki no Kyojin. But is Shingeki no Kyojin worth the hype? \r\nPlot: One-hundredyears prior to the start of the series, mankind was plagued by their predators, The Titans, gigantic humanoid creatures whose only purpose in existence is to devour humans, despite having no apparent need to eat in order to survive. Humanity was driven to the brink of extinction. The few surviving humans built a society behind 50-meter walls that kept the Titans out. The walls were named Maria, the outermost wall, Rose, the middle, and Sina, the interior. There, humanity enjoyed a century of peace... Until... Our main characters, teenage boy Eren Yeager and his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman witness something horrific... The city's \"divine\" walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother along with thousands of other humans are eaten alive. Eren vows to murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind. And so, mankind finds their secret weapon in defeating the Titans... \\n\\n\r\nFirst thing you may be wondering, is this anime as epic as everyone says it is, and is it filled with amazing action scenes? Well eh, I guess you could say that it's a tiny bit, not too much, but just a teeny bit ... IT'S DEFINITELY EPIC. This anime's introduction of the 3D maneuver gear was certainly an creative pleasant to the say the least, surprise. The way the characters jump/literally fly from rooftop to rooftop, swinging their dual swords at Titans, screaming their lungs at every second leaves the viewers mouths opened, and their eyes glued onto the screen. May I add that the soundtrack in this anime is arguably the best set of music in an anime ever. It's epic music certainly adds to the suspense of every single episode in Shingeki no Kyojin. The only thing I'd say took away from the EPICness in Shingeki, was that there was awfully too many dialogue scenes... Although some were pretty nerve-wrecking, others seemed to be useless and pointless.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly... is this plot depressing? Yup. Are there multiple scenes that have brought me to tears? Yup. Have I witnessed characters I love meet their end in horribly gruesome ways? Yup. This is not an anime for the faint-hearted. Shingeki no Kyojin will ruthlessly rip your heart out, throw it into a grinder, then turn it into processed dog food time after time after time ... after time again. This anime is also quite gory, so if you can't stand that, I'd... still recommend you to give Shingeki no Kyojin a try. \\n\\n\r\nAs for me, what I had wondered the most were, is this plot deep (theme)? efficiently written? And enjoyable to watch? Is there an explanation for everything that happens or is it one of those anime that something happens for no reason or leaves me going What happened to the _____ or how did he/she even know _____.\\n\r\nThe storyline itself has no contradictions, is full to the brim with plot twists that are almost impossible to predict. And most importantly, it is VERY enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\n(Skip if you don't care about historical information + deep themes) Well I will say that the plot has a deep theme. The circle of life and escaping every-day routine and achieving freedom (humans trapped within walls, never seeing the ocean, mountains, volcanoes, forests, plains, and never having an adventure until...) concept is included in the plot. What was also quite intriguing that you probably didn't know was in Shingeki no Kyojin was the use of Norse Allusions. Narrative tales for centuries have, for centuries, been borrowing and re-constructing myths from previous generations in order to create new tales to amuse and inspire. Mythology has been incorporated into many stories to provide emphasis on major themes and create a more complex universe for the reader to experience. \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d written by Hajime Isayama draws extensive inspiration Nordic myth such as Snorri\u2019s \u201cGylfaginning\u201d and \u201cProse Edda,\u201d creating integral elements and parallels within the story by incorporating fundamental Norse ideologies into the fictional universe\u2019s framework. It is these elements of inter-textuality that create a context in which hermetic moments can be experienced, while expressing creativity through the literary tradition of interpretation through connotation. As for the circle of life, humans for once are on the side of the preys. Why is it wrong for titans to eat us, while it's okay for us to (raise and) kill animals in order to eat them? In this world, the strong are the predators, and the weak are the preys. The strong steal all and win all, the weak get stolen from and lose all. That's just how this rotten world (in reality) works. The anime delves into the \"strength\" of humans vs the titans. Escaping everyday routine has been a theme in many famous stories, such as \"The Dubliners\" (read it, very famous). How can a person live when doing the same thing over... and over... and over everyday. How would you feel if you were confined within a small amount of space and never allowed to go outside of that tiny space because you would get eaten mercilessly by a predator out there?\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound in the anime is absolutely spectacular. The soundtrack of Shingeki no Kyojin, composed by Hiruko Sawano is (insert the greatest positive word you can think of). The openings were absolutely incredible as well, and I'm sure that everyone, whether or not you've seen the anime has heard of and fairly enjoyed/absolutely loved the opening, \"Guren Yumiya\". I believe it's the most famous anime song ever. The art is fairly nicely drawn up, and the drawn up 3D maneuver gear certainly was well made. I must say in terms of visuals, the titans were drawn up to perfection! Their faces are disgustingly disfigured and what is up their skin/teeth! They look creepy as fuck, which is great! As for the characters, each person was fairly well drawn up... Although I wouldn't say great! and the horses/skies/plains (nature) was absolutely beautiful and realistically drawn. I must mention that the freedom of wing capes were quite desirable, very cool capes/art.\\n\\n\r\nEren is anything but a traditional protagonist. While a typical hero is driven by a great sense of morality, honor, pride, or a desire to make the world a better place for everyone\u2019s sake and not just their own, Eren takes every stereotype and crushes it. Having lost his mother to Titian, monsters that he already despised to begin with, Eren\u2019s motivation to join the military and eradicate the Titans are based purely on his bloodthirsty need for revenge, not his desire to improve the world. While it is true that he has expressed that he wants to see the world outside the walls, he didn\u2019t really show initiative (his crazy hatred) until his mother died (although he did plan on joining the recon corps).Perhaps my favorite trait of Eren is that, even though he\u2019s the main protagonist, he is pretty weak as a fighter. That is a quality that makes Eren very real. He\u2019s not an overpowered main character; he\u2019s human. He has powers, but his powers are pretty much the only reason he\u2019s still alive. He\u2019s not some kind of god, and he\u2019s far from invincible. He\u2019s, at the core, just a very angry boy that has lost his mother and wants to avenge her, and he does so with an unbreakable spirit. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Mikasa Ackerman, she is a quiet and withdrawn girl and maintains a near constant stoic expression, except when Eren is in danger. Mikasa's attachment to Eren may or not not go beyond feelings of siblings (well, she is adopted). Mikasa is one of those characters that people will love because first off she's beautiful, secondly she's funny and somewhat kind and mean at the same time, and to top it off, and last not but least she's the concrete definition of badass (kicks some Titan ass).\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least our 3rd main character Armin Arlert, a cowardly smart boy who possesses a sharp mind and a natural intuition for strategy which has proven useful on many occasions. Armin Arlert is a character that some will hate for his cowardice and \"no fightingness\" but others will like because he actually uses his brain, and you have to feel bad for him for being so very human (fear). \\n\\n\r\nWhy did I present dragging info on the characters? Because, their charactistics all add so much to the anime. All the other characters in Shingeki no Kyojin are quite likeable, it's just a shame that a lot of them will die out one by one before your eyes. And of course, I will have to mention Levi because he's obviously the most popular character in Shingeki no Kyojin. Why? Well because first of all, he's smart, secondly he's always composed, thirdly he kicks everyones ass, both humans and titans, fourthly he wants to protect people and is in a way a \"jesus\" figure to mankind, and lastly and most importantly, his fetish for always cleaning makes him a hilarious character.  \\n\\n\r\nEven though the whole concept of naked giants devouring humans sounds a little weird at first, the main idea behind it (that is, humans not being on top of the food chain anymore) is pretty well done and the plot grows into an epic adventure that you would regret not watching. Overall the anime is very enjoyable and although some people may call it overrated (it can't be everyone's favorite anime...) I will tell you that you'd regret not watching it for sure. Epic is written all over the anime.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: I guess it's a bit overrated considering it could become the most popular anime of all time, but it's certainly not as bad as a lot of haters claim it is. I guess the hate can't be helped though since with popularity and greatness comes hate. But, people can have different perspectives on things, that's what makes humans so great right? That concludes my review, thanks for reading!~",

            "content": "It pains me in a way to not give Attack on Titan anything but a 10. I completely understand why this show got so popular so fast. I also understand why everybody is impatiently waiting for season 2. I want to say that it is really as flawless as people say it is.\r\nBut I can't. While I would genuinely recommend this show, I am still a critic. I still have to acknowledge that this show has problems.\r\nAs good as this show is, and it is very, very good, I cannot with a good conscience say that it does not have glaring flaws. The biggest isthe simple fact that this show has too much talk. I know that dialogue is crucial to telling a story and developing character, but there is a time and a place for it. There were several occasions where they have a really good story coming up in what should be the very next episode, but the show digs its heels into the ground and spends an entire episode talking about what was coming. It just seems like whenever this show can build up momentum, it feels the need to deploy the drag chute. This show is not nearly fast-paced enough. But this problem also appears within the action. There are so many five minute long conversations, or inner monologues, or flashback sessions smack in the middle of an action scene. The pacing of this show seriously needs work.\\n\r\nThankfully, the good aspects of this show trump the bad ones hundredfold. The action is incredible, the art is distinctive, and the voice acting is some of the best that I have ever seen. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But it is by all means worth watching.",

            "content": "This will be my first ever review on this website, and I figured it best to start with the one series most fresh in my mind.  Attack on Titan was one of the most rewarding anime experiences I've ever had.  Unique premise, serious characters and a vivid soundtrack and art style make the first season of this show one to remember.  I will keep this review spoiler free, as to not ruin the experience for anyone else.\r\nSometimes animes will fall into the trap of taking themselves too seriously.  The main difference about AOT is that it deserves the afforementioned comment.Humanity is on the brink of extinction, being overrun by several meter tall human-like \"titans\" that terrorize and eat humans for just the pleasure of it.  Humankind has succumbed to building three giant walls to protect themselves against the giants, and all was safe and sound....until the first wall was breached by an abnormally gigantic Titan, allowing the smaller ones to get in and annihilate the city.  Eventually the invasion stopped, but the damage had already been done... The number of casualties was astronomical.  The story continues by following Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert as they join the military in hopes of avenging the titan's invasion and The death of Eren's mother.  Throughout the series, their efforts are pivotal in regaining a stronghold in the apocalyptic world.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I love and hate about this series is the character development.  It's just so damn good.  At the same token, it occasionally feels so gut punching when a new character's past is explained, and then they are soon after another casualty in the struggle to survive.  The amount of emotions that are invoked while one watches AOT are tremendous.  I often found myself speaking out loud during a characters close brush with death or laughing during one of Sasha's hungry outbursts.  The story in itself is also unique.  I had been hearing wayyyy too many of the same plots floating around recently, so it was a breath of fresh air to experience AOT firsthand... At the recommendation of so many friends.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art style depicted in this series is also quite incredible.  Influences by Claymore and Casshern Sins are apparent, drawing from past experience of AOTs writer, Yasuko Kobayashi.  I love how dark and gritty the character models can be, and how vivid the backgrounds are drawn.  The music is also epic and fanfareish.  The 2 openings also represent the growth of the story and are both extremely catchy.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, AOT is an anime not to be missed by any fan, especially if you love action and greatly developed characters.  I can't wait until the second season rolls our way soon.",

            "content": "I don't think this review will make me very popular, because I didn't really like Attack on Titan. The first time I tried watching it, I found the first episode so boring and discomforting that I stopped right there. However, as the hype increased and people were hailing it as the best anime of the season, I thought I should give it another shot. The next time I tried watching it, I got to about episode 10 and gave up again. It was too much of a struggle for me. Though after 10 episodes I had started to see the value of the show. \r\nStory:6\\n\r\nI'm sorry, I really am, but there are fundamental structure and pacing issues with AoT. The basic premise is fascinating\u2014a post-apocalyptic world that was ravaged by an almost biblical plague. All of humanity trapped behind walls that are failing to protect them from the monsters outside\u2014but it's execution is lacking. The world, which appears to be richly structured, is never actually elaborated upon: how did they build the walls? What type of social hierarchy exists as a result of the wall? It spends about three episodes on a single battle and then rushes through the training: we go through 5 years in a matter of 3 episodes and then spend another three episodes on what is about a 4 hour period. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also some bizarre story telling choices: [SPOILERS] the protagonist is dead for two whole episodes and in that time they decide it's the best moment to do a flashback to a different character's childhood, while we're still in the middle of a battle sequence. I don't care about her childhood and relationship with the main character: all of the characters are currently in mortal danger and the main character is dead. This is simply not the time. [END SPOILER] There are also general pacing issues: it feels slow, yet we aren't given time to get to know the characters so when the inevitably die, it's hard to really care. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes also have a flat out depressing emotional arc. They start with a smidgen of hope that is just continually stomped down until the end of the episode. I'm sorry, but I like my characters to have a win at least SOME of the time. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also something lacking in the Titans as enemies. They aren't smart, quick, or focused. Watching battle sequences with them is like watching a bunch of flies swarm around someones head. It's just not very interesting. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is outstanding. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. It's gorgeous. The backgrounds are rich, the motion is fluid, and the characters just look good. There is CG, but it's well integrated, and the colors are appealing and appropriate. The only caveat I might have is that it's sometimes a little hard to tell characters apart (but when there as many of them as there in AoT, it's inevitably difficult). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is appropriate and distinctive, the voice acting is strong, and the sound effects don't sound unnatural. I only knocked a point off because the opening theme is sometimes a bit much (I was skipping it by episode 3).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEren is just not a very engaging protagonist. He's a jerk from the moment we meet him, and it feels like he's a jerk for no good reason. He then \"redeems\" himself by deciding to commit his life to a suicidal pursuit of revenge. I found it's tough to appreciate his character, though I did enjoy his inspirational qualities and his defiance of the hopeless state of humanity. \\n\\n\r\nThe side character come off as rather flat. They almost all fit into stereotypes that have predictable story lines. I do enjoy Jean, though, and I would be curious to see if he becomes the essential ally to Eren that I suspect him to be. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nIt was fun on occasion, but overall it was not very enjoyable or challenging. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nThis is definitely a good series\u2014and for those who enjoy dark, battle driven series, particularly fantasy, I highly suggest it (though I warn that I loved Code Geass, another dark, battle driven series, but disliked this). I hesitate, however to call it great.",

            "content": "What would happen if humanity was no longer on the top of the food chain?  How would we adapt, and how would our perception of the world change?  Tetsur\u014d Araki came to answer these questions with the release of his latest series.  It is a tale of tragedy and revenge; of uplifting hope and crushing sadness.  A love letter to the struggle of humanity and its destructive nature.  This is Attack On Titan.\r\nSetting:\r\nThe exact location and time place of AOT is unknown, but based off of the clothing, architectural style and character names it is safe to say that theseries is located around Germany and takes place during the 17th century.  Humanity has locked itself away behind three impossibly tall walls named Maria, Rose and Sina.  After the outer most wall, Maria is assaulted and damaged titans flood in, starting our tale of woe.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story of AOT is quite simple, but not in a bad way.  Yasuko Kobayashi (the anime writer) didn't over complicate the plot with half baked symbolism or conspiracy pandering.  AOT knows exactly where it wants to go and doesn't waste any time getting there.  Don't get me wrong I'm not saying the series is dull, far from it actually; I just find it refreshing to watch a show that doesn't spend the first half trying to convince about me how cool and artsy it is.  I knew exactly what I was getting, and AOT never changed that.  In addition to the narrative, the actual setting is wonderfully crafted.  While removed from reality AOT never strays to far from the believable.  Everything fits from a historical point of view; the powerful religious presence, the centralized political structure, the proper use of period weaponry.  The only problem with the story its pacing.  While fine for most the show it does tend to drag between episodes 10-15.  The show presents our characters with a simple task that takes them far too long to complete.          \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note I found a lot of similarities between AOT and the average mecha story line.  While AOT is leaps and bounds over most generic mechas I couldn't help, but make some connections.  Angry new-comer discovers hidden robot (titan power), uses robot to avenge loved one, fights others with similar robots, gets butt whooped, gets stronger, defeats opponent, rinse and repeat.  I just thought it was an interesting notion.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'll start off this section by saying that, for the most part, AOT was animated by a brand new studio with no other anime under its belt.  Studio Wit is a surrogate of the well know studio Production I.G.; so its member clearly have experience, but until AOT they had never worked directly on a project as a singular group.  So with this in mind it is literally astonishing how much quality this show has.  Seriously, if Attack On Titan were a fruit it would be dripping with the succulent juices of grandeur.  Most shows allocate their budgets to the most \"important\" parts of each episode, i.e. the action scenes.  In turn this causes most of the scenes involving dialogue and plot development to come off as unimportant and lack luster; when in reality these scene are just as, if not more, important than the ones involving action.  However, the animation for AOT never falters; each scene is given the same amount of care as the others.  In addition, this show has an air of excitement about it.  I could tell AOT was more than just another job to Studio Wit; they truly care about this series.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the animation beautiful, the art style itself is brilliant.  The varying thicknesses of black borders around each character and object helps to add an increased field of depth during scenes of rapid movement.  This creates a sense of urgency whenever the characters use their 3DM/ODM gear, only maximizing the excitement the show puts off.  The art of AOT is perfect, literally.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OST for Attack On Titan should be used as model to teach young composers about the necessary elements that make up a great soundtrack.  While not perfect, the OST hits every note it needs to, and then continues on to become even better than required.  Even though all the tracks are great in their own right; a few of them managed to reach the \"anime peak of greatness status\". Those would include the two openings of the series.  Which are easily up there with \"Cowboy Bebop\" and \"Baccano!\" (btw second opening is best....let the fighting ensue).  Sound design on the other hand sits right at the average mark.  Most of the sounds are over used, and were never that great to start.  So, after a while it can leave a bad taste in your mouth.  It works for what it is, but isn't anything to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nAs the astute reader you are, I'm sure you have figured out that I will always watch the English dub if available.  So how is the Attack On Titan dub?  The best way to describe it would be unique.  I say that, because some of the voice actors Funimation picked require a certain taste.  For example, Bryce Papenbrook choose voice Eren in a very forceful manner.  It reminds me how most people sound when they smash their toe; jaw clinched with a slight growl in their voice.  Personally, I rather enjoyed the English dub, but I understand that I am in the minority of this one.  I would recommend to watch the first four episodes in dub, and decide where to go from there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIn the character department I would compare AOT to the critically acclaimed video game \"The Last Of Us\".  I understand that not everyone is a gamer as I am, but just bare with me here.  The characters in both of these are as unoriginal as they come.  However, they weave such a unique story and have such interesting development, that in turn, they become fresh and a great enjoyment to watch.  Some of the development is a bit rushed at times, but it always comes from a natural progression and doesn't feel forced in the slightest.  As any anime junkie would know, that is an accomplishment on its own; especially in this sea of generic rom-coms and forced love triangles.  My main complaint is the lack of development for side characters.  Some get their deserved screen time, but others only receive some kind of goofy quirk as to be memorable without actually accomplishing anything.  We have potato girl (Sasha), bald dude (Connie) and freckles kid (Marco).  I want to know their stories and what kind of people they are beyond their stereotypical traits.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nAll flaws aside, Attack On Titan is one of the most entertaining shows I ever had the pleasure of watching; I can't wait of season 2 to be released.  The action is exciting, the story is tense and the animation is beautiful.  I give it a rating of Must Watch on my scale of recommendation.\\n\\n\r\nMasterpiece-Best\\n\r\nMust Watch\\n\r\nWatch\\n\r\nTry The First Couple Episodes\\n\r\nSkip It\\n\r\nRun For Your Life-Worst \\n\\n\r\nAs usual I recommend you buy a copy, and help support our local dubbing companies and the anime industry as a whole.  However, just taking the time to watch it is of greater importance.\\n\r\nAs a final statement I recommend that you take my numerical scores with a grain of salt; as numerical scores are easily skewed and each person has their own understanding of the 1-10 scale.       \\n",

            "content": "It's nice to have an anime this popular that isn't just tsundere school rom-com no' 10746 for a change. But does that alone make said anime great? No, not really.\r\nThis is a spoiler free review.\r\n*Story*\r\n*Insert synopsis here*\r\nAside from the monsters being replaced with Titans and the interesting weaponry the people have, we've definitely seen similar stories in anime before, whether it's Claymore, Blue Gender and maybe even Highschool of the Dead.\r\nLeaving that aside though, it doesn't do a very good job with its narrative. The story relies on coincidences, has forced exposition, uneventful pacing and it also has unexplored themes that are tossed away assoon as they're raised.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting in general is poorly explored. For example, they make it clear that there's a slave trade going on within these walls, but that issue is never raised again. Apparently they also have religious sects that worship these walls as deities or something, but that's never explored either, aside from killing them off in an ironic and disrespectful manner (hah! that'll teach those religious people for having faith and hope!).  There are even social classes among citizens, and of course, the higher the class, the more evil you are (that's how it works in clich\u00e9 land), but even that is just there to show us what good people the main characters are by comparison.. They also present corruption within the military and competition amongst its different branches. Granted, the latter is explored a little, but the former is hardly touched and is just there to shock you. So despite how rich the setting seems at first, at the end of the day all you will care for is the fight against the titans since the rest just remains background decoration.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a common thing to say that the first episode is Amazing, but I wasn't impressed. To me, the first episode is also the first mistake it made. It seemed deliberately rushed in an attempt to make the audience gasp at the sudden deaths of characters we know nothing about (pure shock effect). \\n\\n\r\nThis is the first mistake because the pacing does slow down significantly later on and I think the first episode was the only one worthy of getting fleshed out more, instead of diving in to the massacre straight away. The rest of the episodes don't even exploit most of their slow pacing very well. It has a habit of slowing down deliberately in order to end most episodes on a cliffhanger. Sure, it might raise the tension, but it also serves to make the series less eventful inside its already limited number of episodes (which means less of a story).\\n\\n\r\nAnd maybe I'm just nitpicking here, but the exposition insults me. It assumes I'm a retard who can't put 2 and 2 together and the characters have to go out of their way to explain things about their world that they should already know just by being born there. This show could've had no dialogue whatsoever and I still could've picked up on a great deal of what's going on. So the script just comes off as amaturish.\\n\\n\r\nAnd like I said, the story also relies on occurrences that are not very likely, but because it involves the main characters, anything is possible. It's nothing that bad or distracting, but I'm still gonna go on a limb here and say; that's not good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, it just ends in the middle of nowhere and leaves you with nothing but another cliffhanger (surprise, surprise).\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair though,  the setting is still pretty creative (as unexplored as it is) and it does do a decent job in foreshadowing some interesting plot twists and gradually revealing mysteries, mainly about the Titans. But that's pretty much it and even that is incomplete for now.\\n\\n\r\n*Characters*\\n\\n\r\nThese are tired shonen characters who are completely out of place.\\n\r\nYou have a Mary Sue who's super strong for no good reason, the smart one and mr angry pants.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, Eren, the angry one has good reasons to be angry, it's completely understandable. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all he is and it's probably not the best idea to have him as a main character since it gets old really fast.\\n\\n\r\nYou also have Mikasa who's an absolute perfect being for some reason (I gave up on questioning it). We can't make her flawed of course since that'd mean she'll have room for character depth, we can't have that. And there's simply nothing to remember her for besides her relationship with Eren, being perfect and her sexy lips. So yeah, a lame character with no development and the most ludicrous backstory I've seen in a while, which also happens to be Eren's backstory. Which explains why she's his pet.\\n\r\nNice..\\n\\n\r\nThe third character is Armin, the weak but smart one. I guess he's ok, since he does seem to grow more than the other two.. Aside from that he's forgettable as well since this show's characterization in general is very shonenish and obnoxious in an otherwise dark setting. \"The power of friendship!\" (ok, they don't actually say that, but they come pretty close).\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, these 3 characters are each supposed to complete each other with their traits, which is a nice idea, but that fact is stated directly to the viewer, much like everything else in this series (so much for subtlety).\\n\\n\r\nThere's also another notable character named Jean, who's kinda like the Vegeta or the rival in a shonen series. And much like Vegeta, he's the only one who goes through actual growth and he even reacts to the events in a way that resembles a human being. Too bad he wasn't the main character, he suits the grim setting much better than the others.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters are defined mainly by their quirks or their looks and there are others who are just evil for the sake of being hated by the audience and aren't shown more than once. Many secondary characters aren't fleshed out and the vast majority of deaths in this series are of nameless characters or ones you don't remember. It's understandable considering the circumstances, but that just makes the main cast appear more plot armored than they already are. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the characterization of common people during the intense moments is pretty decent. Probably a little over the top at times, but I still think it was handled rather well with how they panic and such.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters could've been worse, I mean at least they have character consistency, they are given some focus and I should probably applaud them for not being overly sexualized, which is a very rare thing in anime these days. But I have no clue what people see in them since most of them are pretty simple and feel ridiculously out of place.\\n\\n\r\n*Art & Sound*\\n\\n\r\nI'll cover this part more briefly.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are kind of unique, I guess. I actually like the thick outlines the artwork has, you really don't see those much anymore.  The surroundings look beautiful, both the forests and the towns. Everything just seems gigantic. The animation itself (while not always consistent) is great and the battles with the 3d camera movement is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. Though I wasn't too thrilled about most of the Titan designs, and some are significantly cooler than others.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is arguably one of the best openings in recent years, it's just masterful (too bad opening 2 happened midway). Same goes for the soundtrack in general which is beautifully intense and makes everything seem more epic. The voice acting is nothing special and maybe even over the top, but I realize that the script probably told them to scream a lot, which is not always easy to pull off so give them some slack.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed some of it, but from a point on I mainly just watched it apathetically. I do concede that it's not a boring watch, that's for sure.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI've been mostly negative in this review, but to be fair it was still a fine show, or at least passable in some respects and the production values are great. But I doubt it will stand the test of time\\n",

            "content": "If there was ever an anime experience that would leave you needing therapy, marathon-watching Shingeki no Kyojin is it. Perhaps this is the best way to watch this series; by the end, you'd be so emotionally exhausted and mangled, you'll know what total despair is like. Not since Berserk have I seen an anime capable of utterly destroying... hope. Yet in spite of its soul-crushing hopelessness, Shingeki no Kyojin is entirely about hope. Without it, mankind would have nothing.\r\nIn this world, giants roam the land. These \"titans\" (as it's been anglicised) prey on human beings. They are brutal, violent and unstoppable. Their arrival is asmysterious as their motives. They do not eat to live. They do not eat anything else. They consume human beings and vomit them out. Humans have become worse than livestock on the food chain. At least sheep or cows are eaten for a reason. There is no discernible purpose for why the titans eat humans. They just do, and living with this fear and confusion behind the giant walls of the last known stronghold is the dwindled population of all of humanity. They've been able to keep the titans out for over a hundred years. Life in a cage, but life nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin begins with the protagonist Eren Jaeger questioning whether this kind of life is worth it. Freedom does not mean breathing boxed in, awaiting death. That's not life and he vows to use whatever power he has to fight the titans. With him is Mikasa, a girl adopted by his family, and his friend Armin. While Eren is strong-willed and rash, Mikasa is calculated and fierce and Armin is thoughtful and soft-hearted; the trio play off one another's strengths and weaknesses in order to survive. And this anime becomes a war for survival.\\n\\n\r\nEren makes for a dependable protagonist. He carries the series well, despite having some \"shounen hero\" tendencies but perhaps his enthusiasm is necessary in a world where people drop their swords and flee in the face of danger or who opt to police within the safe walls of the rich inner cities. However, Mikasa is probably the show's great hero. Powerful, naturally gifted and determined, she carries Eren whenever he falls. As he is her only family, she is terribly protective of him. She lives entirely for him, and this may seem to be the only detriment to her character, but her loyalty to him is understandable when you learn of their past. Armin will be nobody's favourite off the bat. Wimpy, small and unable to fight, he has developed his intellect instead. The other characters are well-crafted and have distinct personalities (though they are just as many \"Who's that again?\" ones as well). Some of the stand-outs are Levi, a very short, extremely experienced and talented captain, Sasha, a girl who seems to gladly choose getting punched in the face by her superiors if it means she can get a potato, Annie, who like Mikasa is very strong and capable, and Jean, a spoiled and cowardly soldier who eventually becomes someone whose growth you can possibly be proud of. It's easy to like them... but maybe it's not entirely wise.\\n\\n\r\nOne of Shingeki no Kyojin's characteristics is that nothing and nobody is safe. It is not afraid of itself. It does not shy away from brutalising its audience or characters because honestly, this is a horrible place and time to be alive. It constantly reminds you of human mortality and fragility. Some people might tell you \"don't get attached to anyone\". Sound advice, but you won't take it. The characters in this series are constructed so well that you will root for them as they pick up their swords and then cry out in disbelieving grief as you see them crushed like a mosquito. Blood and then silence. It's not entirely right to say \"nobody is safe\" as plot-immortality applies to certain characters and that is quite evident. Although the anime is going to make you doubt yourself.\\n\\n\r\nGone are the anime physics where someone can go flying into a wall and can get up without a scratch. If someone flies into a wall in this anime, that's it. Game over, man. Game over. This is no anime for children; it is a complete bloodbath. It is not afraid to show you crushed limbs, torn-away faces, stinking, steaming bones, people's necks being snapped like chickens. It doesn't shy away from letting you hear screams of people facing their last moment on earth.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's not the violence alone that will sock you hard ones to the stomach -- it's the story itself. The concepts behind what is presented and also actual events will have you reeling. The second arc of this anime more or less will have you screaming \"NO, IT CAN'T BE\". Because you simply don't want to believe what you're seeing or who it involves. The entire series will have you holding your head wondering what is going on. The characters themselves don't really know, and you share that confusion with them. Shingeki no Kyojin's story is by far one of the most creative and well-crafted in modern anime history. It has the right tone, focus and content. It develops surprisingly at every turn. This is an anime you cannot necessarily lay out a trajectory for in terms of what is going to happen. You take every episode like it is tomorrow -- you ultimately cannot know what can or will happen.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, it boasts some finely animated fight scenes, especially when the soldiers use their gear to go \"flying\" through the city. This gear is pretty inventive and can be likened to Spider-Man's web-slinging. The soldiers train to be agile and precise using this gear as it catapults them through the air. The best users of this know how to manoeuvre throughout a city block, across a titan's back or across the sky as though it were their first nature. The animation makes sure to keep you on your toes during action scenes, angling shots to keep momentum or knowing just how close to do a close-up for the best effect. The dark lines and general colourlessness of the art style keeps with the tone of the overall series. However, you can see where budgetary shortcuts were had, and while nothing to deter from the series, it is not quite perfect. Music-wise, the sound builds on the horror and the dramatic tension, and while some tracks are certainly recognisable as you watch on, they aren't entirely memorable.\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin is all about experiencing it. You can have time later to think about what's happening or to theorise, but there is no time for that in the midst of watching. There are only held breaths, churning stomachs, wide eyes and feelings of absolute horror. There are times when humanity seems to be getting somewhere, where you think, okay, there's a chance now. Hope. It exists somewhere, as small as it might be, hidden in the depths of crushing losses and corpses and city rubble. It's there, and that's what Eren and his friends will give their lives to find.",

            "content": "How does one review an entity such as Attack on Titan? It has gathered a massive following had has taken the anime community by storm. Anyone who calls themselves an anime fan has undoubtedly heard of the show and even those who aren't anime fans probably have seen some kind of merchandise floating around wore by someone... someone like me who has a Attack on Titan backpack. But just because something is popular doesn't make it good. \r\nPLOT: So humans are now no longer at the top of the food chain and were nearly wiped out 100 years ago of 1000ish years ago (they neverreally explained what time period it it) so humanity is forced to lived behind massive walls to protect themselves from the Titans, these massive naked human looking monsters that eat humans. We start of to see a young trio of children going about their daily life and thinking about what all kids think of, what life is like outside the walls. More frolicking about happens and sudden a massive titan appears and breaks down the wall. Dozens of Titans invaded kill people and we get treated to one of the most emotionally gripping scenes I've every seen in a show. \\n\\n\r\nSo now our main protagonist Eren and his buddies Armin and Mikasa enlist in the army and go on their journey to kill all titans. This sounds bland but the story is going at a lightning pace that things change very fast and you can expect a twist and turn all throughout the show that it will keep you on your seats begging for more, or for my case, marathoning 10 episodes in a row. The story breaks the mold of generic revenge story and adds things like conspiracy and thriller aspects that propels the experience. However there are some points in the show were you can so glaringly seen them going all like \"This person is TOTALLY normal wink wink\" and the foreshadowing alarms go off, but that never distracted from the overall presentation of the story. Also there is lots of action and fighting stuff which I'll get too later...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\r\nOur main hero/protagonist is Eren Yeager, a young solider who enlist because he watched his mother get eaten by a titan and wants revenge. He is hot blooded and won't take no for an answer. There's Mikasa who is Eren's stalker/adopted sister/baddass. Then there is Armin who is there to cry, get in the way and make plans for battle situations. Eren is too me at least in the beginning kind of a bland generic character. I've seen these kind of super angry main leads before and most of them aren't interesting. Eren evolves just enough to keep him from being bland. Mikasa is a character that I think is a bit overrated. Before going into this show I read everywhere how Mikasa is the best character ever created and I just don't see it. OK sure is ridiculously talented in combat. OK she isn't a generic tsundere. What stands out to me is here wanting to protect Eren which makes for a lot of speculation as too what their relationship actually is, but Eren is more or less an ass to Mikasa in those situations even though Eren does care for her just not in the same way she does. I'm am really glad that the writers didn't make these two characters love birds as that shtick has been used over and over and over. Armin is the only main character that seems to have a working brain as he doesn't go on titan murdering rampages. He is also practically useless in combat. He comes up with ridiculously complicated battle strategies that seem too always go as planned or at least achieve the objective even after a major fault happens that ends up killing half the squad. Yes this show has the Tomino \"kill em all\" approach to characters. Everyone in this show you like will probably die, that sounds like a spoiler but its not. I had to start telling myself not to like characters because I feared that they would get eaten five minutes later. Having characters that don't have plot armor makes the show fell more action packed that it already is.... and it is. The interaction between the characters is good and a shout-out to Levi.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION:\\n\r\nWell... My word who is funding these people the Brooklyn Nets? The budget for this show must be endless as I never recall a time when this show didn't look like pure awesome. The animation for this show is simply outstanding, the actions scenes are breathtaking, and when they used the 3D movement gear my God does it look stunning. The art style is rather unique too with thick black borders around the characters and the Titans (some of them) look very disturbing. The scenery is gorgeous and those action scenes.... just so good.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nTHAT OPENING!!! Yea the first opening for this show is amazing. So is the second one. So is the fight music, and so is the dub and yes I said DUB. DUB! I can already see people moving their mouse to \"Not helpful\" before going onto the next review but the dub for this show was done by Funimation and such is of the up most quality. Bryce Papenbrook is great as Eren because no one can scream like him, Trina Nishimura fits Mikasa almost freakishly well and Josh Grelle does a great job making Armin sound like a wimp because that's exactly what he is. Oh and Matthew Mercer is just silky smooth as Levi. Great job Funimation for getting a good cast.\\n\\n\r\nENDING (NO SPOILERS)\\n\r\nThe ending is paramount. This story is incomplete but there is a second season coming sometime soon so that makes this section pointless, if it were too end right now it wound be terrible but it doesn't so yea.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nAttack on Titan has been the only show that has made me impatient enough to go out and read ahead in the manga. This first season was extremely well done and the series as a whole has tremendous potential to be something very special indeed. I give this a strong recommendation too anyone that likes a good story driven high action series. Attack on Titan is a great watch.",

            "content": "During that adrenaline rush stage of viewing fast, heavy-hitting content, we tend to lose all train of thought for the pixelated images flooding our screen. We are blindsided by the idea of what could happen next. Our brain racing to process new information as the stakes of any given set-piece is further compounded. When boiled down to its essentials, this rapid succession of quick build up and an immediate payoff is the cornerstone for many successful action titles. That \"rush,\" that moment, is the pleasures we seek out in them; the very thing that makes the action genre so appealing, to begin with. It's forthat reason that they remain significant breadwinners across many storytelling mediums. Once we're locked in and find ourselves immersed in the experience, everything else becomes secondary. Who has time to question the practicality of James Bond dispatching henchmen on top a speeding bullet train when we could just sit back and enjoy the spectacle? No one does, that's who! We're too busy living in the moment-to-moment rush to be bothered with any other details. So understandably, this can cause a false sense of judgment when trying to gauge the subject matter's level of quality control. It's easy to buy into the absurdity of any given situation when you're caught up in the middle of it. Thematically, you may just be consuming something that's 90% hot hair and 10% gray matter, but God be damned if that isn't the best 10% mass of gray matter you've ever consumed! \\n\\n\r\nBut what happens when we do bother to give ourselves a moment to question it? When all those problematic aspects that we once shoved to the wayside has now been given time to be mulled over? All of a sudden, an immersive experience can become questionable to what was there all along. As we settle down and pull ourselves out of the situation, that excitement once offered by that clump of gray mass has now been slowly revealed for what it truly was all along. We pull back slowly to see the bigger picture, to see the 90% that we ignored; and to our surprises, there it is, the puckered out rear-end of the elephant in the room. Rationality kicks in and the spell that was once hanging over our heads have now been broken. For better or for worse, our blind appraisal has now dialed back to something more rational. The enjoyment that the content offered us may still remain intact, but our assessment of it have changed accordingly. This discernment comes as a result of separating individual enjoyment from that of impartial analysis\u2014or as we regular folks like to call it\u2014\"using common sense.\" We shift from living in the moment to retroactively assimilating the moment. Basically, we as viewers begin to establish our own form of quality-control standards, in more words or less; an act that's too often mistaken as \"hating on something\" when in actuality, it's quite the opposite. It's the act of fully appreciating and digesting the content, for both its good and bad attributes, instead of pretending those attributes don't coexist in the same body of work.   \\n\\n\r\nIgnorance may be bliss, but a proper understanding of the content you consume is true satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nToday, we'll attempt to do just that with Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan), as we snap out our trances, wipe the drool off our faces, and take a step back to view the elephant, or in this case, the clumsy naked giant in the room. And by doing so, we'll aim to comprehend what's become one of the most popular anime titles of all time.\\n\\n\r\nWhether you adore or loathe it, Attack on Titan's prominence in the 2010s has made it an ambassador for anime-related content, both in and out of the anime community. And really, it's not hard to see why. It's a show that presented itself as a typical shounen product, but when viewed, comes gift-wrapped in the aesthetic sensibilities of a hardcore, grindhouse seinen feature. The equivalent of which is like parents taking their 10-year old kid to watch 2010's Kick-Ass or Super under the presumption that \"it's just another Marvel family-friendly superhero film,\" only to be greeted with the grim reality that it's anything but. Their newly found realization of this fact coming in the form of bloody entrails being sprayed across the movie screen like celebratory confetti; a consolation prize offered up by the director for getting their assumptions wrong. \\n\\n\r\nKeeping that in mind, Attack on Titan's marketing strategy was nothing short of a stroke of genius. In its 1st episode\u2014where the falsehood of stability within a medieval town was instantly flipped on its head\u2014an act that's commenced by a stampede of carnivorous giants tearing citizens apart in the most gruesome fashion possible; the anime community collectively \"lost their shit.\" Seemingly overnight, viewing the show became something like a cultural event. As the selling point given to the uninitiated went something along the lines of \"just wait for the twist bro!\" An organic marketing tactic driven by word of mouth was born, the likes of which eventually led to it being in the top 5 most viewed anime titles, on all, if not most anime-database websites by the time the final episode aired. And now, after a few years have passed to see the effects of it in retrospect, it turns out we were witnessing the birth of a new gateway title in the making, as the show became an outsider window into the anime medium and how it falls into the current pop culture landscape at large. All of a sudden, there was a renewed interest for the Japanese import, made all the more obvious when you consider the growing number of companies that are trying to tap into the potentially lucrative market that might present itself to those willing to unearth it. A cultural bubble that's been steadily flowing beneath the business world's feet since the late 80s but with a modern-day face finally being attached, making exhuming it for profit easier than ever. This was no longer \"our thing\" fellow members of the anime community, this was now on its way to becoming a marketable sub-culture once again, thanks in large part to titles like AoT bringing back visibility to the medium, with its tentpole pitched high for all to see. \\n\\n\r\nThis slight removal of fan ownership may have led to the first noticeable wave of backlash for the show. The delicate bruised egos of long-time anime fans that don't want \"their thing\" being associated with the loud, brutish thrashing of AoT's typical portrayal. And honestly, it might stand to be the most superficial reason to dislike any piece of media as well. Anime as a medium doesn't get to decide what face it will wear in the public's eye, in the same way, no honest-to-God movie-buff like the face of their past-time being represented by any bloated Hollywood remake of a beloved classic. \\n\\n\r\nPopular media, whether that be for music, movies, TV shows or books, are usually represented by the loudest, most accessible examples of their respective medium. Their credibility in these cases is usually secondary to their marketability. So whether you like or dislike the show, just make sure you're not doing so under the pretext of its popularity, because at that point, whatever you have to say will just fall on deaf ears, as this discernment of media is a very rudimentary fact that should be understood by most. With that being said, in an effort to get ahead of the inevitable shit show that accompanies the discussion of any popular anime, let me make my stance on the matter very clear: I LOVE Attack on Titan like a fat boy loves cake. As of the time of this writing, it's on my \"top 100\" favorite anime titles, while far more critically acclaimed works don't even make the final cut. It may not be seen as a substantive viewing experience, but let's face it, we all need our comfort food, and in the case of AoT, it's the show that serves that role for me\u2014it's my McDonalds. \\n\\n\r\nI see no reason to bastardize the title for its inherent mainstream appeal. That's just how it is. Any criticism or appraisal I will offer towards it from here on out will be based on what it had to offer and NOT the role projected onto it by outside forces. A true critical evaluation of anything, (favorites included), comes with the acknowledgment of both its strengths and weaknesses, not from pretending a work is lacking in either attribute. Now with that long-winded precursor out of the way, let's get on with the review. \\n\\n\r\nThe first and perhaps most prominent feature of AoT was its audiovisual output. It may not seem like it today, with the advent of consistently grander looking animated productions, but at the time of AoT's release, the show was seen as a high watermark for televised animated works. Alongside titles like 2011's Fate/Zero, AoT's visual presentation output took on, what was seen at that time, as the kind of attention to detail that was only afforded to animated movies. Before face-palming terms like \"sakuga\" was widely popularized for describing well-animated sequences for anime series, it was usually narrowed down to just a handful of moments throughout a show's run-time. With the rise of the aforementioned titles, that thought process changed, as well-animated sequences were dispersed throughout the entire runtime, at what seemed to be random intervals, as opposed to before where such efforts were reserved on the basis of selling some penultimate climactic act. Now, seemingly out of nowhere, moments that truly didn't need any extra flair was also getting the same attention-to-detail that would usually be reserved for the first and last episode of any other show. Whether you care to admit it or not, AoT's massive success played its part in paving the way for more flair in directing and presentation in anime shows to follow. But where titles like Fate/Zero only found popularity in the anime community's upper echelons, AoT went on to find even greater success, becoming a household name for even those unfamiliar with the anime culture altogether. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were simply boundary-pushing. For the first time in a long time, fluidity wasn't treated as a secondary concern. Layered textures and shading weren't placed on limited supply. Choreography wasn't immediately reduced to speed-lines and the infamous \"cut to black\" shots to insinuate movement. Backgrounds weren't just scene-placeholders to avoid figuring out the topography of the land in order to give locations a sense of existence. Wonky character models weren't just accepted as a byproduct of \"because of the budget.\" AoT proved that there was a better standard worth aiming for. And no, I'm not saying these techniques or shortcomings weren't found in AoT, they certainly were, but the degree to which the show relied on these techniques to avoid having to extensively animate, direct, or compose scenes, were significantly less, while at the same time, having a noticeable increase in favorable choices usually thought of as rare exceptions. \\n\\n\r\nThe bombastic orchestral musical selection, cleanly rendered 3D animation, well-choreographed action scenes, great use of cinematography, anatomically precise character movement, directing tricks usually reserved for live-action films; all of this and more made it an immediate hit with viewers. \\n\\n\r\nIt was grand, dare I say it, even \"epic.\" A sense of scale that felt absent in too many shows at the time. Where most action-orientated anime settled for locations that didn't amount to anything but battlefield backdrops, AoT tapped into a storytelling fundamental that the shounen genre all but abandoned: worldbuilding. This may not seem all that significant for a seasoned viewer that bothers to forage through the entries of yesteryear, but for the less-experienced viewer who've only accustomed themselves to the drab landscape offered up by a limited selection of underbaked locations usually presented by this genre; effectively, what AoT did was stimulate an interest that many viewers didn't realize they were yearning for. An interest that makes the biggest difference between memorable or forgettable stories. This creative decision was perhaps the biggest reason owed towards the show's continued success beyond its audiovisual marketing.\\n\\n\r\nBut before we could dive into how cool those Spiderman-like web-slinging city-dive shots were or what it meant for the action scenes, we must first examine the massive undertaking that the creators dedicated towards AoT's worldbuilding that made all of it possible. \\n\\n\r\nIt's no coincidence that the show effectively opens up by introducing us to the walled-off city and the architectural structures of the buildings inside. Or better yet, the scale of these structures when pitted against the monstrous threat that inhabits this world. All of this was done to help start the process of setting the stage. Something the anime will continuously do throughout its run. You see, proper worldbuilding doesn't just stop with establishing shots, it's something that's supposed to expand alongside the story to help accommodate the content placed in it. And in the case of AoT, that means a whole lot of inventive action, intriguing locations, and tactile environments that feel every bit as convincing to anything found in the real world. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the title cards inserted at the halfway point to the medieval-inspired European houses, there's not a moment where the show isn't making the viewer privy to new world details, visual landmarks, and macroeconomic world functions. It cultivated a lived-in world for its inhabitants by reinforcing the means of living, the area layout of its civilians, even things that may be perceived as trivial, like the functionality of the weapons that the military uses. You see, in order for things to feel important, you must first give the viewer a sense of existence in the world, to be able to grasp what's at stake for those within it. So later on, when this once considered \"useless\" knowledge festers in the back of the viewer's mind \u2014 seeing the limitations of citizen mobility, the seemingly endless maze of alleyways, and the sense of hopelessness experienced by humanity when cornered by the evil forces out to get them \u2014 all of a sudden, the viewer is now standing there with them and not simply on the outside looking in. \\n\\n\r\nMany action movies like 2006's Casino Royale or 2008's Taken don't have to worry about most of this because its world and locations are already accepted as is; this is the true advantage of live-action. This is why James Bond and his antics have very little hurdles to cross to make the audience accept what's going on because the world they're placed in is our own world. It's \"real.\" AoT, and similarly any animated feature, isn't alotted that immediate acceptance, something that's often taken for granted. If the world isn't thought out, it's hard to get enveloped in it. So when you're running your fingers across the rough surface of a moss-covered stone, creeping through the back streets occupied by the dilapidated housing of the common people; their homes built up by lumber that's slightly weathered by decay; contrasted by the sturdy, clutter-free appearance of the religious facility, with its towering structure shooting up over the houses dwarfed below. Or simply lying under a tree, as the grass and blue wildflowers surrounding you are rustled by the breeze, the endless stretch of Wall Maria looming in the background, registering no comment from the citizens, as they accept it just as much as you accept the Pyramids or Eiffel Tower as real-life landmarks; you're getting a firsthand experience of all of this worldbuilding detail at play. You may not be aware of it, but somewhere in your subconscious, these registered efforts are sinking in. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of what tonal issues the show may have towards the interaction of its world \u2014  and trust me, there are some serious issues \u2014 the actual worldbuilding itself is pretty solid.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough talk about the important things in the background that makes this all work, let's discuss the fun shit that everyone could comprehend; those awesome ass Spiderman-like, web-slinging city-dive shots! Tetsurou Araki, the madman behind this stroke of directorial genius, is no stranger to over-heightened, summer blockbuster-style action. Before AoT, he gave us the most unnecessarily intense, borderline comical potato chip eating scene in Death Note; the physics-defying Matrix boobs bullet-time effects of High School of the Dead; and who could forget, the booty-shorts wearing, boat-hopping leapfrog shoot-out scene from episode 3 of Black Lagoon. When it comes to directing the hell out of an action scene, regardless of how ridiculous the final outcome may be, very few come close to Araki. He's basically the self-aware version of Michael Bay/Zach Synder for anime. \\n\\n\r\nBut there's a lot more that goes into making these action scenes work. For one, Araki seemed to have a good grasp on capturing field-of-depth by allowing the foreground and background enough space to properly breathe. Without that discernment, the show could have easily become a muddled mess of incomprehensible motion (think most shaky-cam scenes for action movies). Where it could have turned into a nauseating rollercoaster ride of unnecessary directing techniques, Araki was able to demonstrate restraint when the scene called for it. Which may seem like an odd thing to say with a show that quite literally has people flying across cities and giant naked people trying to eat them. \\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that helped give the action scenes staying power was the sheer amount of diversity given to not only the battle locations but also the titans themselves. From the claustrophobic feeling given off by the town environment to the woodland dominated by towering trees, every battlefield is given careful consideration for the fighting forces of humanity and the titans they come against. \\n\\n\r\nBut what good is all of this appraisal of the show's action scenes without addressing the second biggest highlight: the music. \"Heavy-hitting\" is possibly the best way to quickly describe what the music selection here has to offer. Like Araki, who's reputable track record has brought him fame and appraisal within the anime industry, so too is the case for the man behind the music of AoT, Hiroyuki Sawano. Sawano's musical style can best be described as a mixture of orchestral and electronic. By blending the traditional with that of contemporary music, he's able to give a feeling of timeless familiarity, while simultaneously retrofitting it for a modern audience. With booming brass instruments starting off the charge, primal drums flowing in the undercurrent like a steady heartbeat, the crooning of an incoming choir ascending from the center, and string sections that cascade into the mix with a signature snare; this soundtrack elevates the anime like a shot of pure adrenaline! Riling up the viewer for the events to come. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a wonderful symbiotic relationship shared between the audio and visual department of AoT; the kind of dance between elements that's rarely ever this unified. Given Sawano's work on Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn, Guilty Crown and several other projects before getting involved with AoT, the vetting process was far behind him. What we got, as a result, was someone comfortable with his craft. A kind of swagger only obtainable by true experience.\\n\\n\r\nWith the directing of Araki at the helm, Sawano's musical prowess propelling it even further, and the efforts of every other crew member involved, the end result was a type of synchronicity that felt every bit as planned as it did coincidental gatherings of the right people for the job. Sawano's sense of auditory dramatics melded perfectly with Araki's pension for high-octane content, both of which lend itself perfectly to Hajime's writing style that focuses on melodrama and theatrics. What we have on display here was a perfect storm of individual thinkers all working towards the same core sentiments. And while that flare for the dramatic may have worked in the favor of most of what was presented, in some aspects, the outcome was a bit... juvenile. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to a presentation decision that may have served as the first point of contention for most viewers of the show: the hammy, over-the-top voice-acting. \\n\\n\r\nThe screenplay for this anime seemed to have been composed entirely of capital letters and exclamation marks. It's the kind of absurd overacting that someone like Nicolas Cage might employ on one of his many B-movie escapades. But here, it's played without the slightest hint of sarcasm. And while I found this to be an amusing attribute, and honestly another reason why I enjoyed AoT, given my soft spot for schlock/B-grade content. For most not acclimated into that realm of entertainment, scoffing at these performances may be an involuntary reaction. And for those that do find this annoying, I completely understand. \\n\\n\r\nThe general approach taken went something along the lines of this:\\n\\n\r\n-Any other anime: \"Let's come up with a plan to get out of this situation.\"\\n\r\n         V.S\\n\r\n-Attack on Titan: \"OMFG BRO, LIKE WTF, WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!!! LET'S THINK OF SOMETHING WHILE SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF OUR LUNGS, EVEN IF WE'RE SURROUNDED BY TITANS AND TRYING NOT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO OURSELVES AT THE MOMENT!!!! OK!?!??!\"\\n\\n\r\nI wish I was being hyperbolic here, but this is what AoT does on constant repeat. The concept of \"inside voices\" was completely lost in this universe. So while I may laugh hysterically at the sheer madness of the voice actors seemingly being prompted to \"unleash their inner crackhead,\" I'm in no way condoning this as some positive aspect. \\n\\n\r\nAnd since we're addressing the issues of AoT at this point, I guess it's time we address the clumsy naked giants in the room: the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor every appraisal I've lobbied at AoT for its worldbuilding, the same number of issues can be found with the story that takes place in it. In the process of picking up the ball dropped by many other shounens, AoT accidentally tossed the story down a flight of stairs, where it seemingly suffered a concussion on its long way down. AoT's story was plagued with several issues, one of which may perhaps be one of the worst kinds of narrative conceits: the mystery box. And what I mean by that is that you're watching 25 episodes of \"stuff\" happen, but nowhere is there a conclusion, or better yet, a sense of purpose or finality to any of it. Cohesiveness is missing, instead, what we have is a series of \"and then\" plotting choices, as is usually the symptom of anything relying on the mystery box appeal to sell its feature. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're reading this, you've either seen AoT or heard enough about it to understand the general idea, so I won't waste my time regurgitating information you could simply find in a synopsis. What we will discuss, however, are the ways these narrative decisions ended up hurting the show. And if that means exposing the number of calories in my unhealthy comfort food as a result, so be it. \\n\\n\r\nAoT is erratic. Having nothing to truly say or no insurmountable goal it's trying to get to means that it could, and did, become one hell of a journey. When your story becomes akin to an unpredictable roller coaster ride of happenings, all to reach an elusive mystery that's ill-defined, yet naked to all those paying attention to it; the sheer level of sensationalized theatrics that the creators could tap into is bound only by their ability to imagine it. This, as a result, ensured that every episode of AoT was marked off with a huge cliffhanger. It basically became voluntary visual entropy. Like the genius behind its organic viral marketing, this scatterbrained approach to \"just go with it\" storytelling, under the guise of knowing what exactly you're doing, ended up creating some truly spectacular firework displays. It worked in the past for live-action TV shows like Lost, is currently the reason that One Piece can span onward for eons, and will be the reason that AoT will carry that baton into the future.\\n\\n\r\nSuccess in the eyes of the business world breathes this dilemma: make a true-to-self statement or appease others for personal benefit. You could try to have it both, but that's a goal rarely obtainable; compromise is almost inevitable. If this wasn't apparent enough, AoT's creator, Hajime Isayama, has also gone on record many times admitting to several changes he's made to his original idea for the material, all of which correlate with the reaction given by outside forces. This wasn't done out of an artistic effort to give the \"true\" experience he envisioned, but simply because the studio heads and newfound fanbase surrounding the project started yelling \"we need more!\"\\n\r\n It's this same kind of push for more, regardless of what it means to the original vision, that was expressed out loud from the likes of Kazuhiko Torishima of Dragon Ball fame, where he openly stated in an interview that \"-it should\u2019ve been wrapped up with the Frieza Saga.\u201d but cited the commonly expressed truth that when something becomes so big and popular, at some point, your vision becomes much more than simply \"your thing.\" Eventually, everyone takes selfish ownership. In the public domain, self-entitlement is an ugly beast that's yet to be tamed. Hundreds of episodes later, and clearly \"ending it at Frieza saga\" wasn't the case. \\n\r\n\"George Lucas is selfish because he won't give the public distribution rights for the original Star Wars screening. Marvel \"sold out\" because they gave up their movie rights to The Mouse.\" \u2014 there's really no winning this argument either way. The power of the dollar trumps all. The power of demanding fans trumps all. And sometimes, that also includes artistic integrity. AoT became another statistic. \\n\\n\r\nBut now we're starting to enter a morbid place, so let's get back to that fun shit! Time to address one of AoT's most talked about features: the shock and awe of its excessive violence. \\n\\n\r\nThe violence is the feature that links the \"characters\" to the story. I use the term \"characters\" loosely, as its mostly just a wide range of stock-piled cannon fodder; where only being characterized enough to only get a cast mention would be the equivalent of a death sentence. And I'm not talking about any beautiful send-off, as the music slowly swells into a crescendo, I'm talking some really heinous shit! You don't just \"die\" in Attack on Titan, you are torn limb from limb! You become the center attraction of abject horror! By the time one of these \"characters\" leave this earth, their arm is stuck somewhere ontop a rooftop, while their torso is halfway down the throat of a naked giant with down-syndrome eyes, munching down without a care in the world. AoT is high caliber schlock. Schlock that transcends to the upper echelons of Tarantino blood-splatter. Schlock that rides the coattails of exploitative media. Cannibal Holocaust would be proud.\\n\\n\r\nIt's honestly one of my favorite aspects of the show, but let's just be clear, being a favorite aspect doesn't mean it's a good one. This is my McDonalds after all, let's not forget that. You see, the problem with reducing your \"characters\" into a Russian Roulette spin of \"what person can we brutally kill next?\" is that it divides them into two exacerbated sides: \\n\\n\r\n1.) plot armored to gross extremes \\n\r\n2.) expendable to gross extremes. \\n\\n\r\nWhen main characters are shown surviving death-flag incidents against all odds, despite what the universe shows you about said chances for other characters involved, it renders their upward mobility to success charitable. Even contrived at times. The screenwriter's pen begins to leave creases into the product. There's a clear line made, as clear as their heavy marker-like character outlines. And once you notice who's in the safe zone, it's hard to unsee it. It becomes a blemish for those taking the show seriously. Me, not so much, I knew my McDonalds wasn't nutritional from the moment I purchased it. But for the ones who bought the snake oil, expecting more, that absence of care would be frustrating, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nAnd on the opposite side of the creased-outline, we have the fodder. People who are made solely for their eventual deaths. It's like watching people lined up before a gun firing squad. You start remembering them for how they died rather than who they were. They become a part of the blood splattered decoration, their remains paint the walls, the rest, a pile of bodily fluid, covered in stomach acid, left out in the sun to bake, (Did I mention that the deaths were gruesome?) In all seriousness though, AoT's characters are not good in the slightest. They're there to facilitate either cool fight scenes or cool death scenes; there's really no in-between. \\n\\n\r\nAnd when death becomes a party trick and character success a hand-out, the tension, the stakes, everything, suddenly means so little. \\n\\n\r\nI love AoT, but at no point can I take it seriously, because it's a show that's shown me time and time again that it doesn't even care about itself enough beyond spectacle. For AoT, integrity is a secondhand concept to theatrics. It's schlock entertainment with an A-Grade budget, an as such, some of the best in the medium. But that's where the appraisal begins and ends. Because when the momentary high is over, when I recline back in my couch, settle in, swallow the last bite of that comfort food, my stomach immediately growls and I find myself on the porcelain throne, purging that \"good-time\" out with projectile accuracy, while simultaneously dispensing a can of Febreeze, creating an artificial cloud to cover my nostrils. \\n\\n\r\nAnd you know what's the fucked up part? I'm sure I'll still be coming back to have second helpings. There's more to life than veggies, we all need our comfort food, whether we choose to openly admit it, or shamefully hide behind terms like \"guilty pleasure.\" So go ahead, bite into your BigMac and do it without shame, because I'll be the last person to ever cast judgment.",

            "content": "I don't really get all the hype that's been surrounding Shingeki no Kyojin, everyone's just been buzzing about it since it started. Is it the art? Is it the titans? Is it all the senseless killing? Or the story?\r\nShingeki no Kyojin is one of those that I like to call as cannon fodder anime, it introduces many characters who's only purpose is to be killed off trying to act as shock deaths and shock the viewer. At the first episodes when the titans attack the city and start stomping down people and eating them it really sets the tone and atmosphere of the series. Itshows that titans are a serious threat and they're not killed off easily, they can regenerate and only way to kill them is to cut a piece off their neck in a quite specific spot. First episodes are really great as they introduce the characters, Eren, Mikasa and Armin, and the titans, and clearly show what the goal of the main heroes is.\\n\\n\r\nThen as episodes go on and titans attack again, and again and again you just start to notice the faults of this... which apparently people do not notice. For one the story. Overall it's ok, but moves at a snail's pace most of the time without any good reason. Many of the unnecessary flashback scenes, or just dragging a scene overly long do not create any better atmosphere or contribute to the story in any way. Some shows like to take things slow but usually they also do that because they want to show maybe the world around the characters or have the characters action tell the story instead of words. In SnK there is a lot of standing around, people just staring with over dramatically drawn serious faces on. It doesn't add anything to anything, it's just padding and filler because the manga isn't that far ahead, and it shows but that's not an excuse for it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I didn't like was that the characters die all the time, everytime they introduce a character you just don't care because there is a high change they're going to get killed to try and shock you. At first, as I said, it sets a tone that this isn't a nice world they live in, they have to live in fear of these monstrous titans that might come crashing through the gates any moment. But after it goes on and on and on with it everytime the titans arrive, it just gets boring and doesn't add anything, again it's just filler and try to make it as gory as possible. Only in the almost last episodes when some people die, not gonna spoil it, does it actually affect the story and decisions of the main character and it feels like it wasn't there just to shock you, it had a purpose and didn't start to repeat itself.\\n\\n\r\nSo I might be bitching about this show a lot, but there are many really good stuff here too. Art style is really good, characters have thick black lines around them and it's unlike anything I've seen. It feels really heavy and characters have a lot of emotion on their face thanks to these thick outlines.\\n\\n\r\nAction scenes are superb. The soldiers have really unique tool, 3D maneuver gear, that they use to try and take the titans out and can move swiftly in almost any environment that has something to grap onto. The bigger fights with titans are really well done thanks to great animation. Action is fluid and really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter progression with the main characters during the first episodes is nicely done, they start as childs and they really show what they're fighting for and why they hate the titans, and what they want to do. Story follows their growth as they start to train to be able to get kill titans. Too bad other characters are quite poorly done.\\n\\n\r\nI still don't get where all the hype for this came, but I really recommend watching SnK. It's a good show overall, it has its problems that I think should not be ignored, but it's a great action series, but so are many other animes and they don't seem to get this much attention. The last 5-10 episodes were really good though. Eagerly waiting for second season that might take some time because manga seems to be progressing really slowly, and I think they should've waited a bit more with this anime to adapt the manga all at once and really do a greater than great show which I think this could've been.",

            "content": "Subject: \"Attack on Titan Review: Is It A Masterpiece or A Colossal Disappointment?\"\r\nShingeki No Kyojin, AKA, Attack on Titan, is one of the most popular manga series based on the same name that defeated the two best known manga in the series, \"Naruto\" and \"One Piece\". And to be honest, it was indeed gives me a massive, MASSIVE LOVE to this franchise. From start to finish of the first season, I'm very grateful that I've watch this majestic masterpiece that came from the walls of Production IG (Known for the anime \"Kuroko no Basuke\" series). So here is my review:\r\nStory:\r\n(SPOILER ALERT For Episode 1)\r\nSo inthis story, there was a man named Eren Jaeger who lives within the walls which is protected against the man-slaughtering, humanoid eating \"Titans\". At first, during that first episode of the story, their lives there within those thick walls were peaceful and a happy community with some concerns regarding to the walls and also, to the Survey Corps, a group of soldiers who risks their lives to defeat the titans. But, when a Colossal Titan suddenly came just outside the Wall Maria Section, their peaceful lives turned into real-life nightmare, when that Colossal Titan kicks the gate and entering a small to giant size titans with very disturbing faces. Killing not only the residence within Wall Maria, but also to the Police and Eren's Mother. And with that grim remainder, Eren seeks revenge and he wanted to join to the Military to defeat \"...those M--------ing Titans...\"\\n\\n\r\nAs I Watch this anime from first to last, the main story is very well-written, and it has a very great plot twist that I didn't want to expect, and a very explainable storyline and characterization. And, by what I mean, \"Very Explainable\", it means, literally, this anime is full of talking and less battle and other climatic sequences that really wants to burst your bubble for just a few minutes of talking. I know some of you out there wants a good explanation regarding to what is going on out there, including myself, but there's more time for that, especially on the battle sequences between those Titans. So I wish they could fix that on the upcoming Season 2...\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nConcerning of their artwork and animation, I think it looks more fascinating and astonishingly splendid when it comes to Titan's Faces and it's pure gore and speed of every animation. I mean, hell, I Don't Even Know What Am I Doing Right Now, Am I Watching an Anime or Am I Playing GTA: Attack On Titan or Assassin's Creed: Attack On Titan right now? It was indeed face-paced animation and I want that element to stay that way in the next installment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFirst of all, the background musics in AoT is giving me goosebumps when that first encounter of the Colossal Titan came to attack the first wall, and that was a masterpiece. Including the other soundtracks during every episodes, and the Opening Soundtrack is also giving me goosebumps. Every single one of those soundtracks were perfectly fit to this anime and that was awesome and stylish.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nFor the \"Killing the Character\" sequences, I don't know if any one of you watches \"Game of Thrones\" but this anime has that kind of formula, except that they are trying not to kill any single one of the main characters. Only the ones who were related to the main characters or the minor characters of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the main characters like Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert, these three has a well-balanced abilities. Like for example, Eren is a well determined mind with vengeance flowing out on his veins, Mikasa is a femme brutale character with overprotecting love to Eren, and Armin is the weakest man than the two of them but he has the brains. And as for the other characters in AoT, especially the \"Potato Girl\" Sasha Braus (My Waifuu) which has a comic-relief side because of her demand for food, and Annie Leonhardt, who has a mystery behind her serious and emotionless face, the characters are pretty well-developed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nI Can't believe that Shingeki no Kyojin was directed by Tetsuro Araki (known for directing \"Death Note\", \"Highschool of the Dead\" and \"Guilty Crown\" anime adaptations). I really have no idea it was him who directed this masterpiece all along. But, anyways, this anime is really gives me some nightmare fuel and the goosebumps that I've seen here. The gore, the blood, the brutalities, you name it. All of these kinda makes me watching a some kind of Horror Movies that is WAAAAAYY more scarier than any other scary movies out there, except they are way more supernatural, and way more awesome than ghosts or poltergeistic ghouls.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, despite this awesome anime sequences, they are also some flaws that they must need to rework with, like the \"More Fight, More Gore, Less Talking\", more plot twist, and much better storyline like this anime too...\\n\\n\r\nSo, My Final Verdict to this Masterpiece is a PERFECT 10/10... It was the Best, Gore Festival I've ever seen in this anime. (Alongside, Parasyte -The Maxim-). The minor flaws are just talking, but, in my opinion, their \"more talking\" has sense to it and to the story itself, I would gave that a 9/10 if those talking sequences are just plain \"useless\". But next time, try to make some room for the Titan Fights and Other Plot Twists, alright? I don't want my excitement goes down like I was having my very first sex then  my boner disengaged when we were just talking about our lives with less sex.",

            "content": "Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyojin has become one of the biggest anime, at least stateside, over the past few years. Unfortunately many shows that are popular often get caught up in the hype of fans and when people view it when hype has begun to cool down it is often that these shows often get a lot of backlash since they are not as good as everyone who watched it years ago says it is. Fortunately I think that Attack on Titan is well made enough that it will not be seen as trash by viewers years from now when if it doeshave some issues.   \\n\\n\r\nTo start out with the good the show has top notch production values. The animation stays great throughout which especially shines during the completely awesome and often brutal action sequences that are sprinkled throughout the series. A word must also be said that the show also has a very unique art style with heavy outlines around the characters which helps the show pop out without doing anything too distracting.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite the oldtimey setting of the show the music often has a somewhat electronic feel to it and while some might be distracted the music really helps set the epic mood and at times can get you pumped for the next fight.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is never too out of the ordinary, the world that Attack on Titan creates is interesting enough that you are guaranteed to stay interested in whats going on.\\n\\n\r\nBut everything is not perfect unfortunately. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there are a plethora of characters in the show that are often very interesting, most of the cast outside of the main 3 protagonists don't really get enough screen time to get very developed. It also doesn't help that some characters will just randomly die before you get attached. While one of Attack on Titan's claim to fame s the fact that they often murder characters you often don't get enough attachment to some who die in order to make their deaths have as much emotional weight as they probably should. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also has slight pacing problems as the show goes at a almost breakneck pace in the first few episodes until it suddenly decides to slow down. Luckily by the half way point enough happens to make this less of a problem. \\n\\n\r\nAlso while this show certainly tries to be epic it sometimes goes into hilariously over the top territory but not too often.  \\n\\n\r\nEven with these problems the show is still a great watch. It is quite brutal though so if you can't stand violence stay out. Also the storyline isn't complete yet and at this point a sequel is very likely which is good since I along with many are interested to see where the story goes and aren't willing to read the manga to find out. \\n\\n\r\nSo while it may not be perfect Attack on Titan it seems that it is just too big to ignore and that is why I am happy that it is of a very high quality. \\n",

Combat action involves stunning choreography as armed soldiers spin or fly in mid-air with their 3Dmaneuver gear before striking lethal blows to titans. Certain circumstances cannot be predicted accurately as SnK shows no hesitation in killing off supporting characters. The majority of the episodes end in surprising and unexpected twists as soldiers fight to save humanity by risking their lives to accomplish one goal: destroy all of the titans. The pacing is steady, allowing viewers to understand the plot and characters with extreme detail. However, the primary objective is too complex to complete in 25 episodes. A cliffhanger ceases the opportunity for more exploration of the titans and other characters.\\n\\n\r\nTip: In the middle of each episode is a helpful \u201cInfo We Can Share So Far\u201d section. It lasts for less than 20 seconds, so it\u2019s advised to pause and read the info. Most of them are hidden data that are not quoted by characters in the series, including history of the titans and info about the communities. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the characters, including the MCs, have motives behind their actions, and they develop and strengthen after experiencing tragic events. For example, Mikasa\u2019s sole purpose of protecting Eren throughout the series has more to do than just her personal feelings for him. Eren is the main protagonist and has a strong passion to destroy every single titan. He was intolerably whiny and irresponsible in the beginning but slightly matured halfway through the series due to interactions with experienced squad members. He gains common sense and looks at situations from different angles. However, he does not fully develop as his old ways sometimes reappear.\\n\\n\r\nMikasa and Armin may appear clingy to Eren at times, but the trio spend much time apart with other characters, primarily during the second half. Mikasa is the strong female heroine who is a master in combat action. She\u2019s fearless and presents a major attraction with her swift moves of killing multiple titans in one blow. Armin showed great improvement in his character. He starts out as a coward but becomes willing to strategize despite his fear. He is also quite the genius and contributes to resolving various mysteries of the titans. Along with Armin, there are many characters who present or develop great charismatic skills. \\n\\n\r\nThe large number of squad members have personalities ranging from indifferent to determined, and they all distinguish with their levels of combat ability and leadership. Some of their attitudes can be hilarious, depending on one\u2019s sense of humor. The anime goes into the past of some of the important characters and highlight relationships between them. It helps the viewer understand the characters and develop a love/hate relationship with them. The only downside is the inability to explore other important characters before the finale.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8)\\n\\n\r\nProduction I.G. and Wit Studio did a fantastic job with the animation. The thick outlines displays details within the background and character design. The artwork emphasizes excellent visual effects of combat action and characters maneuvering between buildings, trees, and other landscapes. All of the settings from the cityscape to the forest are remarkable. Character designs are distinct, and the unisex military uniforms reveal great details, thanks to the outlines. Characters\u2019 fear and other emotions are generally shown with black lines drawn on their faces, contributing to the horrifying theme of SnK. The black lines symbolize distress, anger, frustration, etc. Bloody scenes of titans crushing and eating human bodies fulfill in making those primary creatures look terrifying. Titans are drawn as ugly and naked overgrown human beings. Some are shown to be skinless, and the vast majority are the opposite. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few problems with the art. There's no distinction in gender between the titans. It was not an issue in the beginning, but it later becomes something important to note in the series. Another poor part about the animation are the stills. There are some scenes that are at a standstill with the characters talking like an idle page in a storybook. Other times, there would be fixed scenes with only one or two objects striking attention with movement.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9)\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors adjusted to the characters\u2019 personality, making their emotions and identities suitable for the fearful and serious atmosphere. The stomps and groans of titans presents practicality to the anime\u2019s theme, considering the type of monsters Hajime decided to create. The music from the theme songs to the background is memorable. Background music includes warrior-like songs and sometimes fast-paced or choral music during fights. The entire soundtrack adds a grand quality to the series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9) / Overall (8)\\n\\n\r\nSnK is one of my favorite action anime, even after re-watching it a few times. In addition to the cliffhanger, I found Eren to be really annoying. There was a scene where Eren hurt Mikasa physically, and I hated him for intentionally harming a lady. SnK\u2019s focus on other characters and increased suspense made it much better. The characters' behavior were humorous at times, and there was always something to look forward to after each episode. As a result, I experienced laughter and shock throughout the series. Due to its popularity, I\u2019m looking forward to a 2nd season and reading the manga in the meantime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SnK has entertaining combat action, surprising events, and remarkable visuals. It provides details throughout the series to keep the viewer current on events, and it gives quite a bit of attention to the characters. Apart from its incomplete ending, I highly recommend any fan of action anime to become familiar with the SnK franchise.",

            "content": "Oh boy, Attack on Titan. \r\nUp front, the more time passes between me, having watched the show and now thinking about it, the more average it becomes. I came to the conclusion, that the show severely lacks memorable moments. Many may call BS on me for that, but really think about it. Excluding what happens in Episode eight...I think, there was almost nothing for me to remember fondly. I'll say, that upon first completing the show, I quite liked it and would have even called it good, but that is just not the case anymore. \r\nMost of the things like character-motivation, their development and thepacing just seem quite off. The characters like Eren, Mikasa and Armin are completely one dimensional and void of almost any interesting aspect. \\n\r\nNow I know. It is shounen, what do I even expect? But the straw of thinking too deep into it doesn't work this time, because even when you scratch the surface of these characters, they still seem to be completely uninteresting. There is no concept worth exploring here, no  good idea hooking you to the adventure and what is there, is boring after a few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI try to at least be as objective as possible with these reviews (try to, not succeeding, shut up), but in this case I can't not mention the constant annoyance the main character and his constant angsting about the things that happened in the first episode, is. Jesus Christ, his whole existence revolves around angst. Realistic portrayals of characters do not just use one aspect of them and blatter us over the head with that non-stop. There needs to be at least one high-moment to correlate all of the low moments. If he is in constant angst-mode and always shouting, it becomes meaningless and more of a joke or a running gag, than a conflict or a struggle for the character. And that problem encumbers most characters in this show. Their constant one-note struggles and conflicts ultimately do not mean anything because it is all we ever see of them. Characters, besides the plot are paramount for me, which is why it is almost everything I talk about in this, but it is the main point I want to give you an understanding of, so there you go. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so people in this show are not remembered for their characterization or their interesting personalities but rather for very stereotypical aspects and their designs, which is very repetitive by the way. It just looks too bland and uninteresting for my taste. They could have at least incorporated a few different uniforms and colors but no, brown it is. \\n\r\nThat could very well be the name of the anime, \u201cbrown it is-the anime\u201d, but I digress. \\n\r\nWhat looked like something good in the first eight or so episodes came to a grinding hold in the boulder arc, did not really pick up after that and just left me with a great desire of the story continuing like it did in the first eight episodes and not the way it did. The few twists it threw in were nothing too surprising and pretty easy to figure out, if you at least try to pay minimum attention. The last scene at the end failed completely in hooking me for the next season and that pretty much sums it all up.\\n\\n\r\nIt's almost addicting to not care about this anime anymore. Hype didn't last for good reasons. Stuff's painfully mediocre with a tendency to annoy me more than entertaining me.\\n\\n\r\nOP theme still awesome though.",

            "content": "There's only one possible number to represent Shingeki no Kyojin, and that number is a certain one-digit number between 1 and 10 and is a multiple of 3.\r\nYou guessed it. Six. Or nine, flipped the other way.\r\nI know you anime whores and die-hard SnK fans are probably sitting in your chairs ready to light torches and grab your pitchforks and form a mob right outside my front door because \"six\" is a pretty low-end score, at least on my ranking scale let alone for a hyped-up series like SnK, but come to think of it, did you come here to confirm your opinions about SnKbeing 2013's greatest anime show, or did you come here to whine in American-accented Japanese at the next guy that gives SnK a low score because you hate it when people disagree with you?\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit that SnK, through my eyes, was a decent show at best, decent being the number \"six\". And before you and wonder \"wut skoar did dis n00b giv sao?!?!?!\", let me tell you beforehand, I rated it 8, in my own unbiased opinion. I wasn't excited at all to watch SAO, and I was pretty darn excited to hear rave reviews about this new show that brings Jack and the Beanstalk down to Earth, multiplies the number of giants involved, and gives the humans no beanstalk to escape to safer grounds. It sounds interesting, but was it a good show?\\n\\n\r\nSix. I'll stop saying that now.\\n\\n\r\nStory: A fantastic tale about 10-meter-tall zombies eating out every woman and child like certified pedophiles in the world's largest buffet platter with three different types of meals: Outer Wall for peasant's dishes, Inner Wall for middle-class, and the ultimate dessert: the King and his loyal subjects for those fattening delicacies. I believe the first episode gave this story the right amount of pressure to set the rest of the series of events in motion when [literally] the world's largest pop star, Michael Jackson, resurrects as a Titan and has a change of heart to chase after married women instead of children, but a couple of years later, this leaves us absolutely.... nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nSee, I'm fine with that, at least it shows humans are struggling to keep themselves off the main course by avoiding intervention with their larger selves, but what accelerated like a rocket from the beginning has become a race to reach the end as slowly and safely as possible. My grandmother doesn't drive slow enough to keep the same pacing as SnK's storyline, and what should be 24 minutes of giant ass-kicking is in reality 15 minutes of build-up, 5 minutes of something ACTUALLY happening, 1 minute to introduce the cliffhanger, 1 minute for the opening sequence, 1 minute for the ending sequence, and another minute for desperate neckbeards to unzip their pants and fantasize about Mikasa Ackerman being their \"waifu\". That Mikasa Minute usually occurs in-between the build-up scenes, so on the plus side, it gives weeaboos everywhere a chance to wipe their monitors (or leave it there so they can claim to their friends that they also ejaculated on Eren's face).\\n\\n\r\nArt: I can see why every male anime nerd wants to stick something onto their screens every time the females show up. Shingeki no Kyojin has some of the best aesthetics of an animated series that I've ever seen/heard, from the show's sheer amount of gory content to the snapping of bones (which I still feel). On that alone, I've felt something.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: A good number of the characters make very little sense to me. Armin van Buuren RIAA Multi-Platinum Arlert makes spot-on predictions because he's probably reading ahead in his own manga series. Eren Jaegermeister wants to kill all of the Titans and save everyone, but his indecisiveness causes more people to die, not that it matters that dozens die in his care. Captain Levi Denim claims to dislike pointless deaths, but every time he sacrifices a soldier, he never completes his operation, and when he executes the operation, more people end up dying anyways. That's like telling people you're a green politician, yet the car you drive is an environmentally-friendly Hummer H2.\\n\\n\r\nWe also get characters with very little introduction and very little development, who only seem to fill in the role of creating more pointless deaths. Titans are scary, indeed they are, but are soldiers really THAT expendable? One does not simply self-impregnate, clone, or genetically-engineer new soldiers to fight. Sooner or later, there will be less soldiers to feed to the Titans, but then again, the author could always create new ones out of black matter to keep drawing his fanbase in.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite what I have to say about SnK, I found it to be an enjoyable watch. It delivers softcore male pornography on a large scale, and sometimes it adds an extra X to the already triple-X rating and exposes what's UNDER the skin for those hardcore biology nerds (I know, it's too intense just thinking about human anatomy).\\n\\n\r\nWhen the action sequences come around, they deliver. There's something special about the 3D Maneuver Gear that allows for more dynamic camera angles, giving you that same high-speed sensation the characters should also be experiencing. However, if I could pinpoint my absolute favorite moment of this show, I wouldn't highlight anything involving 3DMG. Instead, I would opt for Episode 8, the underground scene when members of the 104th Training Corps attempt to retake their base. Why THAT scene, you may ask? Because it's more fun discharging your guns in the Titans' faces, and it's better doing it in a group.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Yes, I enjoyed watching. Yes, the aesthetics were phenomenal and it did draw me in from the beginning when Michael Jackson went on tour to Wall Maria and ate one of his fans. I thought the action was superb and it was a thrill to watch. But does it make it a great show? In my eyes, not really. Slow pacing, meaningless death, and heavy amounts of build-up define SnK. I know there are people out there who will complain, disagree, and ultimately flame on my profile for disliking SnK, but then again, take this into consideration: I gave this series a 9 from the beginning, and I ultimately decided to drop it to 6. Am I being biased? I don't think so.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you hate my opinion, or if you're hoping to defend the glory of SnK by trying to convert another non-believer to your SnK Fan Club or whatever the hell you'd like to call it, then do me a favor and don't try to shove your opinion down my throat. I've had it happen already, and it'll only tell me how much of a steaming pile of shit you are.",

            "content": "Attack on Titan and I have a history, one filled with love and hate, a re-watch, and the manga. Of course, it seems the entire anime/manga community (and some outside of it) have an opinion on this show. It\u2019s widely popular and has been so for quite a while now. So, just how does this show about giant monsters that eat people take us all by storm? Let\u2019s find out. Rather, I\u2019ll do my best to tell you why I love it (now). \r\nSometime to note is that I really didn\u2019t like the AOT franchise when I first watched the anime. I wanted to likeit, but found the whole thing over hyped and too dramatic. However, after I read the manga and re-watched the show, I know have Survey Corps Cosplay and have become a die-hard fan.\\n\\n\r\nI am up to date on the manga. Detangling my feelings of the anime and manga won\u2019t be easy, but I\u2019ll do my best.\\n\\n\r\nThis review is spoiler free!\\n\\n\r\n[spoiler=Characters]Characters in the AOT franchise are 10/10, but, when strictly concerning the anime, they stagger to an 8/10. On the surface, the characters come across fairly stereotypical. Eren, the shounen lead, is obsessed with getting stronger and revenge and possess a (seemingly) random power. Dig a little deeper and Eren reverses some shounen lead tropes. I can\u2019t go into details without spoiling major things for those who aren\u2019t caught up with the manga, but trust me: Eren isn\u2019t a typically shounen lead. \\n\\n\r\nBack to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nA usual some of the most important lines and little moments that deepen characters aren\u2019t in the anime. AOT characters\u2019 growth is subtle, and the high-paced anime may even include those finer moments but they\u2019re hard to catch amidst all the titan killing action. But, if you compare a character from his/her first episode to his/her last, you\u2019ll see how the story has really shaped and changed the character.\\n\\n\r\nHere are some pluses. The characters are also relatively mature (as the show goes along. Warning: some start as VERY immature had have a lot of room to grow). Also, the characters beside the shounen lead get to have relationships (that actually change and grow) with each other. Again, it\u2019s subtle. Bat an eyelash and you might miss it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters make realistic choices. They react and behave like people who live in a desperate and relatively hopeless society. Some of their choices may surprise the viewer and unveil and new layer to a character. They\u2019re not always the decision the viewers may want or like, but it makes the characters interesting and the story less predictable. Many of the secondary characters have unique and distinct personalities as well (this is largely due to the fact that later in the manga their importance increases significantly). Something to appreciate is the fact characters offer different opinions on the situation without the show spoon-feeding the viewer into thinking one view is better than another. Rather, the viewer must decide for his/herself what he/she believes. The show does not give a \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d answer. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, a lot of characters get tossed at the viewer simultaneously\u2014and about half of them die. Without knowing who lives to become an important character later in the series and who becomes titan chow, it can be a little overwhelming. This is partly why the first time I watched the anime I didn\u2019t enjoy it. People just kept dying so I stopped caring about any of them. This problem also makes it hard to notice the quiet growth between characters and their relationships. Now, after reading the manga and watching it again, I love them all (I even like the bad guys, or, at least, I find them complex and interesting). \\n\\n\r\nAnother minus: the characters are overdramatic at times (for me). While I feel the desperation and understand their hopelessness, I still roll my eyes once in a while. Before the story has pulled you and before you believe and feel how sad they are, it can be distracting. I\u2019ve met a couple of people who\u2019ve even found it humorous at times (I never went that far, but it did (and in three scenes still does) annoy me). The show really plays it up too. It will show random scenes of grieving families that didn\u2019t appear before and don\u2019t show up after just to prove how dramatic and dark it can be. The world is dark enough that these moments subtract from the show instead of add to it. [/spoiler]\\n\r\nScore: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n+subtle development\\n\r\n+believable relationships \\n\r\n+varying personalities \\n\r\n+flawed \t\\n\r\n+more than a stereotype \\n\r\n+believable reactions/personality  \\n\r\n-judgmental protagonist\t\\n\r\n-over dramatic \\n\r\n-too many characters introduced at once\\n\\n\r\n[spoiler=Story] When I first watched the anime, I wasn\u2019t invested in the plot (this is largely due to the fact I wasn\u2019t invested in the characters). After I read the manga, I flung myself headlong into the story and now read the chapters as soon as I can get my grubby fingers on them. After re-watching the anime, I can say the author has had a plan for series from the start. I missed hundreds of little clues while watching it the first time. Answers to huge questions are right in front of your face (I honestly feel stupid for missing them). Some twists are impossible to see coming and only after you\u2019ve caught up to the manga can you fully appreciate how well crafted the plot is. \\n\\n\r\nSome things were still extremely predictable in the anime. I\u2019m hardly ever surprised by big \u201cshocking\u201d moments in anything (anime/manga/books/whatever) and saw a lot of things coming. Others have told me that the anime surprised them, and the show does deliberately play on your expectations of a shounen. There are a few moments where it sets the viewer up to believe he/she knows where the story is going only to whack him/her in the face with a quick turn. That was highly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing to keep is mind is the sheer ridiculous appearance of the enemy. Frankly, the titans are some of the stupidest looking villains in a story to date. While terrifying, it\u2019s humiliating to watch humanity get wrecked by funny looking naked giants (a fact even the characters address). Humanity is often compared to cattle as well, which leads me to think the viewer is supposed to find it frustrating and embarrassing to be defeated by such monsters. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot itself, there is nothing particularly unique about it. The world feels well explained and detailed. And, better yet, it\u2019s surprising easy to relate too. If you feel powerless, like nothing you do matters and all you want to do is matter, somehow; if you feel like there are problems you just can\u2019t face but you wish you were brave enough to stand up against\u2014then this story will touch you, heart and soul. \\n\\n\r\nStripe the story down to its bones and it\u2019s about people struggling to defeat enemies larger than themselves, to face despair and learn how to keep moving. I\u2019m serious here. The characters\u2019 goal is not survival but for their deaths to have significance. In this sense, AOT goes beyond an anime. It reveals the heart of a desperate people and how to never give up. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters have simple dreams and desires batted against insurmountable enemies and stark fear. Such raw simplicity rests in most human hearts, and I believe a lot of people connect with that and turn this story into something bigger. I certainly didn\u2019t the first time I watched it, but I do now. Now, when I see the Wings of Freedom, I see a symbol of hope and determination. I see people who are willing to sacrifice themselves despite their fear and doubt because it\u2019s the right thing to do. I see someone I can aspire to be because theses characters are afraid and angry and flawed just like me. I see heroes I can believe in.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the sentiments I\u2019m referring to occur after the Survey Corps appear. I believe the story improves immensely after its entrance. I find the Survey Corps the real heart and protagonist\u2014if you will\u2014of the series. Don\u2019t misunderstand: the individual characters are fantastic, as is the first half of the show. But the Corps is who and what I connect with. \\n\\n\r\n A step away from the sentimental and existential-ness of this review, the plot is put together extremely well. It moves fast without sacrificing character development. And you can tell the author has an endgame. He knows where he wants this story to go and is slowly taking the viewer there, revealing one little fact at a time, usually one that only opens more questions (the manga has answered some and created more, but things are starting to congeal and it\u2019s fantastic!)

There is actually one character whose gender has been unconfirmed because the author doesn\u2019t think it matters. The girls are not sexualized and are just as strong as the boys. And, you usually don\u2019t see this: girls and boys have the same uniform. Girls are not illogically fighting in skirts but also wear pants, which makes more sense to me.

            "content": "Although it is difficult to review an anime after only five episodes, it is certainly possible to make a few observations about it. Shingeki no Kyojin it is a dark, plot driven anime focusing on the battle for humankind very existence, and it's brutal. There is no Moe, no fanservice and aside from a memorable scene with a potato, very little comedy.\r\nIn these first episodes the balance of power lies very much with the titans. Human kind loses; a lot. In fact many have already accepted that they cannot defeat the titans even with their largest armies so argue against even attempting to fight them.Thosesent to fight against the titans are as afraid as everybody else, and the anime does a good job of portraying believable human fear in these characters. The characters themselves may not be the most developed but they work well, the main trio being the hot headed idealistic Eren Jaegar, his bad-ass childhood friend Mikasa and the weak but smart Armin.Their designs aren't anything special but that is made up for by the titans themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThere is considerable variety to them, from hulking monstrosities down to smaller almost comically grotesque monsters. Although the titans themselves are beautifully animated and the animation is generally of a very high quality, providing sufficient fluidity in the movement of the 3D maneuver gear, the shows unique art style may prove jarring to some viewers. The soundtrack is another strength of the show, with the opening especially being catchy and fast paced in a way that reflects nicely on the show it's self. \\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin is a tense action packed show that moves quickly and isn't afraid to show violence. It's not for everyone but it provides a cool interesting premise with stunning fight scenes and a brilliant soundtrack. It is something I'd defiantly recommend people to try at least due to it's originally and high quality.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To begin, I mostly stumbled across AoT because of its high rating and under that premise assumed that it has to be somewhat decent, which it is. On the whole though, it didn't strike me as spectacular as some people made it out to be for reasons I shall explain below.\r\nStory/Pace: 3/10\r\nTo be honest, the first couple of episodes had a wonderful fast pace as the main protagonists advanced, more about their strange world and titan relationship was revealed e.t.c. However, like most animes who give it their full right away, it ran out of ammunition very soon and a good 1/3 of all episodesas of ep 12 (I didn't check, so I may be off) were recaps and comparatively generic giant-vs-human action. So while the story was initially very gripping, I spent the last few episodes grinding my teeth, while hoping for something other than human group A being slaughtered by giant group B to happen and was sorely disappointed. If I only had taken into account the first dozen episodes, this would be an 8-9, but given this endless drawing out, the anime really does not deserve that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime had their boons/banes, but by tendency, need improvement. Our protagonists are a bit very stereotypical, but made interesting mostly because they keep dying/almost-dying. Generally, all characters are very dramatic and are constantly on the verge of/at a nervous breakdown. Although this would typically annoy me, the anime does deserve credit for making the most convincing war environment I have ever seen (making it much more preferable to those creepy ones where people just casually brush off that their friends just got butchered). \\n\r\nThis unique aspect does however trip and fall horribly among the sidecharacters, who both spawn and die like flies. They show up and some of them die 3 episodes later which is very realistic, but perhaps a tad too realistic. I seriously struggled keeping track of all of them and at some point simply gave up on doing so. There are a few more important side characters who will likely survive, but on the whole I find that they all lack depth. One sees too little of them and when one does, they are either killing titans or mourning their friends, which makes it hard to learn new things about them and understand them.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI must agree, that a good part of the artwork in this anime is phenomenally well done. The colours have a nice glow to them and the various phyiscal features are appropriate. In that aspect, the anime deserves substantial credit. I did however, notice a number of moments where the animated component was missing and the characters were shouting at the top of their lungs while statically standing there. Other scenes on the other hand move incredibly smoothly, so it seems a bit lazily done at times. Still on the whole, very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music of the anime was decent and created an epic feel for the combat scenes. This has however, been done thousands of times and it didn't really stand out among the other animes that practice this. The voice-acting is harder to judge as I am not fluently Japanese, but seemed appropriate. On the whole the sound is good, but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy the beginning of this anime, but it then quickly became disappointing due to aforementioned reasons. Towards the end I just felt like skipping ahead to where something interesting was revealed, but the anime ends with ultimately telling little more than what can be garnered from the first few episodes. I did also enjoy the titan fighting, but can say that the 1st titan fight was substantially more impressive than the 30th and as that was the content of all of the episodes, I bored quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.2/10\\n\r\nOn the whole I feel a bit bitter about the plot's speed, but for those who enjoy  action with high-definition picturesque imagery and epic music, I would recommend it. If you care more about a deep plot with lots of mysteries, don't bother.",

            "content": "There\u2019s a current trend that favors dark and edgy stories such as Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, and so on. Anime, being no different, saw the much anticipated release of Attack on Titan which is based on the manga of the same name. Given the astronomical amount of hype behind the series it certainly had a lot to live up to. That said, the hype was understandable as Attack on Titan seemed to have everything going for it, being produced by Production I.G., having top notch production values, and most importantly having a promising premise. Even I was taken in as seeing the traileralone was enough to make me watch the series as it aired, something I don\u2019t normally do. \\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan follows the story of Eren and the Survey Corps as they fight for survival in a world where monstrous beings known as titans terrorize humanity.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely love the premise of Attack on Titan. It\u2019s definitely something that stands out and is at least somewhat unique in a sea of all too similar anime. Yes, humanity fighting for survival against monstrous beings has been done before but one could hardly accuse Attack on Titan of being generic. That\u2019s unfortunately where my praise ends for the series. While the plot isn\u2019t generic, almost everything else certainly is and it's not long before the show turns into glorified torture porn. The majority of the characters feel like little more than cardboard cutouts, including the protagonist. This is a huge problem in a series where death and survival are the main aspects, and a character\u2019s death has no impact unless the viewer is attached to them. \\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling too much there are one or more important characters that are introduced and die within the span of a single episode. The scenes are presented as if they are supposed to be dramatic and full of emotion, yet these characters are barely shown in the one episode they are in creating a weird contradiction. With little to no information on them it\u2019s hard to really care either way, and important characters should not be merely thrown away to establish tone when there are tons of other more effective ways to do so. \\n\\n\r\nEren is the typical Shounen hero who has one emotion, anger, and only one way of expressing himself, yelling. Combined with his arrogant attitude and knack for fucking things up regardless of his big talk, Eren can become a very annoying character. It would be one thing if he learned from his mistakes, or if other people reacted appropriately to his continuously bad decisions but this never happens in the series to any meaningful degree. Something that also cheapens the impact of all the death in the series is Eren's ability to shounen his way out of death and other various situations on numerous occasions because, you know, good writing is hard to do. \\n\\n\r\nMikasa is Eren\u2019s sister and plays the part of the super cool heroine of few words. She succeeds at everything she does because she has a nice ass and is pretty hot despite her manly abs. This is otherwise known as being a giant Mary Sue. I guess one could argue her weird and unhealthy obsession with her brother Eren is a flaw, but given the backstory behind it just comes off as incest pandering. I guess it's okay though since she does look good in those tight pants.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast consists of various other trainees and the Survey Corps. They aren\u2019t really memorable and I couldn\u2019t name more than a handful of them even if my life depended on it. There\u2019s Armin, he\u2019s not so good at fighting but he\u2019s smart or so I'm told. There\u2019s Jean, he\u2019s kind of a coward that only looks out for himself at first but later grows to have more leader like qualities. There\u2019s Levi, he\u2019s kind of like Eren's mentor and a male version of Mikasa except for the part of wanting to bang Eren, well, unless the shipping community has anything to say about it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few characters that I felt were somewhat more interesting. Sasha probably has the most personality out of all the characters and is at least likeable. There is also a Survey Corps officer who has an obsession with studying the titans who also adds much needed personality to series. I am conflicted however, on one hand the comic relief these two characters provide make them at least likeable but the comedy in Attack on Titan is so silly and contrived that it interferes with the otherwise grim atmosphere and messes with the tonal consistency of the show. I don't have any problems with a show having some contrast, but it should be appropriate to the show and not take the viewer out of the story. A good example would be Paranoia Agent, there is an episode dedicated to three people trying to commit suicide that is quite humorous but stays in tune with the show's dark tone while also making for interesting social commentary on Japan's high suicide rate in real life and plays into the overarching themes of the series. It is natural and fits the show with its dry humor, in comparison Attack on Titan literally pulls you out of an serious scene for a cheap laugh, like Armin and Reiner gawking at a pretty blonde girl while they are running for their lives. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some other problems, such as pacing issues where the series just grinds to a screeching halt and drags on for a fair bit. A lot of other parts of the story dip into shounen levels of silliness and predictability. I\u2019m still not entirely sure how the transformation aspect of the show works either, besides something about biting your thumb while you have some kind of goal in mind or something very ill thought out and almost random. I suppose these are things that aren\u2019t meant to be looked into too deeply\u2026 or at all. The dialogue is also bad with the characters having to explain every little thing they do or have an internal monologue every five seconds. It's all these things that add up and really take away from the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe production values of this show are good. The art and animation are nice and fluid, with the art style itself being very distinctive. The characters have an unusually thick border that outlines them that I don\u2019t really care for, but other than that I found the art in general to be nice. Character design is pretty good even if the characters mostly wear the same military uniform they are unique enough, though I'm not quite sure how they move in those ridiculously tight pants. The technology is pretty neat looking as well, from the 3D maneuver gear to the box cutter swords. The music is decent, if not somewhat overrated. It\u2019s all fittingly high energy and I don\u2019t have a problem with it. \\n\\n\r\nBy now it\u2019s no secret that both the anime and manga versions of Attack on Titan are sweeping successes. Near everyone has watched this show, including people that weren\u2019t particularly big on anime to begin with. While its success with the mainstream market is commendable I can\u2019t help but feel disappointed with the actual content. Much like other popular shows currently airing, I can see Attack on Titan riding the hype wave with the support of the casual market for as long as it can. It doesn\u2019t help that the creator is prostituting the series with several spin offs, a live action movie, and even going as far as to change the original ending to pander to fans. It\u2019s a shame really, I had high hopes for Attack on Titan but a few big missteps crushed those. Regrettably Attack on Titan will be a story of what could have been instead of what was. \\n\\n",

            "content": "The first season of attack on Titan was one of the most interesting animes i have watched. A great story with still so much to be discovered. I found that the story represents a racial war. You see the titans almost have no reason to kill as many humans as they do. It represents what Caucasians did to the african Americans back in the slavery years. \r\nWith a great story, exceptional graphics the only place i saw Attack on Titan go wrong was the characters. Now im not being to critical, we can all imagine that we would be just as traumatized and upset asEren, Armin and the others are due to the fact that there are giant Titans eating all your friends and family. But its just not your typical anime characters. There is so much crying and a lot of the show is characters weeping about how terrible there life is, its just not the anime i am used to. Maybe, in a way thats what makes it better than most anime, the fact that characters show so much emotion. Instead of having a fearless character like Goku or Inuyasha you have characters who are scared and admit their fear.\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan is a wonderful story and I myself can not wait for Season 2. I give the first season a solid 9/10. \\n",

No, we are the hunters!\" Is a term that people who have watched this anime are all too familiar with by now. Attack on Titan (a.k.a. Shingeki no Kyojin) is to 2013 what Sword Art Online was to 2012; a show so hyped that you can't call yourself an anime fan if you haven't at least heard of it. While I haven't finished watching SAO, I am well aware that the majority of people feel it was ruined by the hype. Does AoT fallinto this same category, well, honestly, no. I don't think it does.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nIn an alternate universe, humanity has been nearly wiped out after the appearance of a new species of beast whose sole existence seems to be eradicating humans; the titans. Titans are massive, mysterious creatures whose origins, method of reproduction, and true motivations remain completely unknown to humanity. The humans have retreated into 3 circular walls that are large and strong enough to keep the Titans out, but for how long? \\n\r\nAoT gets major props from me for creating the darkest, most convincing, most tragic war environment I've ever seen in a TV show. The sheer amount of suffering, physical trauma, psychological trauma, and portrayal of devastation is so horrible and disturbing that it is beautiful. If you like watching happy-go-lucky, feel-good anime, this show is NOT for you. Rule number one of watching AoT is to NEVER expect something good to happen. Doe it seem like something good is about to happen? Well, something bad is probably about to happen. \\n\r\nAoT really manages to create an atmosphere where the viewer is viciously cheering for humanity to prevail, and that is no easy task. And of course, that just makes it all the more devastating when that character you were finally starting to like gets eaten. The storyline is extremely engrossing and interesting, but due to the fact that the story is incomplete (hopefully season 2 will be announced soon), I can't give it 10/10 or 9/10 in good taste, but AoT is very much a plot driven anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nVery detailed and stylized. Style is something that is very hard to explain, but it fits the atmosphere perfectly. I loved the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nEPIC soundtrack. \"Epic\" is an overused word, but all you have to do is listen to the opening to know that this show is just EPIC! The voice acting is stellar as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nSeeing that this is an anime that is not finished, it makes sense that a lot of the character development is also unfinished, but the main characters are all intriguing. \\n\r\nEren, the protagonist, is headstrong and reckless, but also very compassionate. He has a fascinating and tragic backstory (that the show still hasn't completely told), and his internal struggle between either sacrificing his humanity for the good of his race or maintaining his humanity and saving every individual he can is very engrossing and one of the show's strong points. Eren is clearly a round character and I like him quite a bit.\\n\r\nMikasa is Eren's childhood friend, and to say Mikasa is protective of Eren is an understatement. She has no family left, so Eren is the only thing that keeps her going any more. She is by far the best fighter out of all the recruits and is a total badass when fighting. You can't not love Mikasa...\\n\r\nArmin, also Eren's childhood friend,  is a frail boy who isn't much of a fighter, but possess great strategic intellect. He has proven to be one of the show's more dynamic characters as he breaks out of his shell as the anime goes on and realizes that he isn't as useless as he thinks he is.\\n\r\nLevi is a BAMF. That's all you need to know.\\n\r\nThere are also tons of intriguing side-characters, but I wouldn't get too attached to them if I were you. NOBODY in this show is unkillable, except probably Mikasa.  Don't be surprised when a seemly major character gets eaten in the blink of an eye. AoT really keeps you on the edge of your seat in that regard. If the show was complete and the character's development was finished, characters would have likely gotten a 9/10 or 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nSo far, AoT is the rare case of an anime living up to the hype. With an epic plot, complex characters, badass art style, and an epic soundtrack, AoT has the potential to be something really special, but lets wait for the end of the second season (which will totally be announced soon) and it's ending to draw any conclusions.",

But then it turned out definitely unregrettable.\r\nThe story is hardcore (I believe one word is enough) and so is the soundtrack. Never have I ever seen a soundtrack that suits the story and the fight scenes that well, it litterly sends chills down your spine, which is why I rated it 10 (and I never give 10). As for the art and the charcters, I can honestly say the design is more realistic than anything else. I remember the firstepisode left me shaken because of the single thought that this could happen for real. However I hated the fact that so many characters died before we got to know them well. It didn't keep me from enjoying it anyway, though you would rethink the definition of enjoyement after watching this anime. Shingeki No Kyojin is definitely not something for the soft hearted or those who easily get attached to fictional characters (which is nothing to be ashamed of).\\n\\n\r\nJust to say, you might wanna watch this anime before you die.",

            "content": "So, SnK. Undoubtedly the most popular show not just of spring and summer 2013, but of 2013 as a whole. You can't go on an anime related site and not see it, and it's very likely to pop up in discussion. Hyped to high hell by almost every anime fan out there. But does it deserve all the attention it gets?\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe premise was great, and had me quite interested at the start. The idea of humanity fighting for their life against an unfathomable opponent who popped out of nowhere is quite interesting. But did the anime deliver? I'm afraid I'd have to say Iwas slightly disappointed. To start with, it damn interesting. Titans attack, mass panic, humans forced to retreat, great; Interesting. What wasn't so interesting were the episodes which followed.\\n\r\nWhile the scenes with titans in them were intriguing, and at best enticing, everything in between seemed like filler. At one point I even recall the cast spending 3 entire episodes discussing moving a boulder, how to move a boulder, and the main character angsting over turning into a titan in order to move a boulder. I'm even partially expecting the OVA to be about the boulder.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nI mean, come on. Am I really supposed to rate it higher than that? The animation and art in this show was incredibly lazy. The show was chock full of still shots, some of which lasted for over 5 seconds, and panning over motionless scenes, without the characters moving a muscle. A lot of powerpoint-tier animation in there as well. The character designs weren't terrible, but they definitely weren't marvelous either. I also am of the believe that the show's artists were having a contest to see who could make the most ridiculous looking titan, which, in all honestly, could be more entertaining than the plot progression of the show at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nNo complaints here. I do feel like a few sound effects, like the titan-transformation, were repeated, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nNo one really stood out for me. The only character development I can note is if they were about to die, and in most cases they did, so they're dead anyway. Minus points for having a main character who's entire personality was REVENGE and I'M GONNA KILL THEM ALL, and a female lead who's motivation consisted of protecting the main character. Bonus points for Jean.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nIt's not all bad, I actually enjoyed the show a little, although it did annoy me at times when literally nothing was happening. But, I won't deny I found the show overall entertaining, but most definitely not on the level a lot people seem to. I'm honestly baffled by how this show became so popular as I can only fathom it as slightly above average at best.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's all. Overall, I'd say that The Eotena Onslaught is a decent show, but don't go and watch it expecting a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Popular anime very rarely receive balanced reviews, which is a shame, because they often set themselves up for a balanced judgement. You either get people worshipping the ground that it would walk on if it hypothetically grew legs and start walking, or people throwing so much crap at it that it becomes in serious need of a shower. Shingeki no Kyojin is no different in this regard, but almost uniquely among recent mainstream titles it's actually deserving of much of the praise it gets. Don't get me wrong, you can still expect a balanced review here. This certainly isn't the life-changing and complex masterpiece thatmany people will promise you, but neither is it as shallow and bland as a lot of shounen anime prove to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhen examining the story, it's best to get the flaws out of the way first. Shingeki no Kyojin is predictable. Very predictable. In fact, the final 2 arcs hinge upon an important mystery element, and if you haven't worked out the big twist almost immediately, then you must have already kissed your braincells goodbye. It certainly does have surprising elements, but when the progression of the plot becomes dependant upon a major story twist it starts to become a little obvious how things will turn out. A second key issue that the series suffers from is a lack of engagement around the mid-point. I'm talking about the \"Battle for Trost\" arc, when I simply found that I no longer felt emotionally invested in the story, nor did I particularly care about the conflicts of the characters. One suspects that this is a side effect of the conversion from manga to anime (though I can't be sure, as I have not read the manga). Shingeki no Kyojin tends to place a lot of dramatic flare on events but the action and development that take place in this arc were perhaps not entirely suited to the impactive stylistic elements that we witness, and it all starts to feel a tad inane.\\n\\n\r\nNow, it's important to note my use of the phrase \"impactive stylistic elements,\" because when I say that Shingeki no Kyojin has dramatic impact, I mean it. It might not be the most amazingly well-written anime in history, but it certainly ranks among the most absorbing as well as the most intense. It builds a rich and complex world with an interesting society and carefully crafted history. We see the structure of the military, the social class system and the lives and attitudes of various demographics clearly laid out before us even when they are not necessarily integral to the plot. It makes it believable, and that makes it absorbing, and this in turn can make it both gripping and powerful. When the action hits it's a cathartic experience, riddled with brutal violence alongside the typical OTT flash of the shounen genre. It looks good and it hits hard. When it slows down to prioritise drama, it generally feels personal and relevant (with the finest example being the finale of the \"Expedition\" arc). The characters do feel a little static unfortunately, but there's some nice development thrown in that hinges upon decent character conflicts and interesting backstories. At times however, it becomes apparent that several characters are forgotten throughout the course of the story, though it is entirely possible that a continuation will expand upon these unfortunate victims of limited season length.\\n\\n\r\nHighly stylised while still showcasing normal anime conventions, the art and animation are entirely deserving of all the praise they get. The animation has weight and the aesthetic is effective and unusual. At times, and most often when the show slows down, inconsistent character models become noticeable, but not to any concerning degree. And if we're talking sounds, then it's damned close to perfect. Fantastic musical score and great voice acting. Whatever you think of the story, you'd be wrong to call Shingeki no Kyojin anything other than a technical masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nNot much else to say, so I'll leave you with this closing statement: watch it. Even if, like me, you tend to adopt the attitude that because many people lack critical judgement it means that most mainstream anime aren't as good as popular opinion might imply, at least be open-minded enough to appreciate the possibility that, just this once, the majority may be right.",

            "content": "*This is one of my first reviews, so let's see how I do, shall we?\r\nAttack on Titan, possibly this year's most popular anime.... and surprisingly, one of its worst as well. Although being immensely popular, Attack on Titan does not live up to the reputation that so many believe it does. Yes, the action and excitement are all very easily seen, yet the predictable/cliche story and the absolutely horrific characters makes this the SAO 2.0. In short, do not expect to be blown away by any means, in fact, prepare yourself for a rather emotional and boring ride that will make you wonder why youare still watching.\\n\\n\r\n To begin with, let me clarify by saying that this won't be an extremely long review, as it has only been six episodes, but I will still mentions as many things as I can for now. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story in AOT revolves around a world were humanity struggles to survive against giant, genital-less Titans. While the story is fresh and includes very nice aspects, the predictability of the story is insane. It is incredibly simple to point out what will happen and when it will happen, and there were almost no surprises that ever arose from watching. Also, the story has some very weak spots, but now it seems that most shows rely on intense action and gore rather than the simplistic aspect of continuity. Furthermore, the show focuses on the aspect of throwing a lot of blood around to make an attempt to affect the audience, when it actually fails to influence any sort of emotion to come forth. Thus, I give the story 6/10 for being good and new, but incredibly boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is actually one of the positive points in this mediocre anime, specifically when speaking about the Titan's ruthless smiles. Other than that, you have smooth action sequences and very gory scenes that couldn't have been more bloody. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Opening's great. I don't approve of the ending though, and action sequence tracks are pretty good. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Now, AOT makes a fairly silly attempt to draw in their audience through rampant emotions, namely, Eren. Eren would be described in anime as: \"The Little Train that could.\" This emotional roller coaster of a character fails to use logic at any given moment, rather, Eren relies on iron strong determination that will somehow be able to physically harm these giant Titans.  He is more childish than any other character and has no actually talent. Yet, this boy will miraculously save humanity, you can bet on it. Furthermore, you have the useless Armin, the unnecessarily complicated Mikasa, the potato-eating, unneeded comedy relief in Sasha, and a whole gang of terrible characters that meet the bare minimum for supporting characters: being alive. Although, people have been able to turn away from these hideous creatures that are our characters, and focus on the \"fantastic story and action\" which doesn't exist. Overall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you watched Sword Art Online and loved it, it is merely because you enjoyed it, more so than critiqued it. AOT is the same. In terms of enjoyment, it is great, but in terms of critique, its flaws can be spotted everywhere. So ultimately, it is up to personal preference. While I want to say it will get a 9 for enjoyment, the utter disgust of watching the characters and cliche story makes me want to give it a 5, so 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Attack on Titan fails to reach the standards that have been set for it. The story is rather cheesy, and the characters are a mess. AOT ultimately shows that an anime will not simply be great because it shows death and blood, rather, it needs a balance of characters, plot, and theme to get the job done. Hopefully, AOT becomes better, because right now, it deserves a 6/10. Nothing special, unless you are easily entertained by puerile attempts to become one of the great anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'll write another review for this after the season is over, but for now, AOT is a letdown.\\n",

            "content": "Please read the Review first before marking it as \u201cHelpful\u201d or \u201cNot Helpful\u201d \r\nOne thing I\u00b4ve been noticing in the past few years is that new anime releases are lacking on originality and a serious plot, so when Shingeki no Kyojin or if you prefer Attack on Titan first came out I had all sorts of mixed feelings towards it, but this feeling of relief was always present on me.  Attack on Titan is one of those anime that even non regular anime viewers praise, but does Titan lives up to all its Hype surrounding it or it just stays as Attack on Hypu?\r\nSetting/Plot:7.5\\n\r\nI will try to not drag out for too much in this part even though Attack on Titan has a very big premise, when humanity is no longer at the top of the food chain because of what they refer as Titans who resemble giant people varying from 4m class to a big ass 60m class have putted humans at border of extinction. Now humans only option is to live cornered in this 3 gigantic walls Maria, Rose and Sina. This situation creates a lot of limitations for humans such as their resources and their live space. On a first look the plot doesn\u00b4t look that amazing or original, but it doesn\u00b4t just stop there as the majority of people think, no, the world of Attack on Titan is much bigger than that delivering complex themes such as new religions, monarchic government, new social ideals, etc.  \\n\\n\r\nSo the anime follows Eren a kid that has always been curious of the outside world, he has always had this motivation to join the Scouting Legion, accompanying him there\u00b4s Mikasa and his friend Armin. When suddenly a Colossal Titan appears with what they call the Armor Titan breach over the walls that have protected them for their whole lives, letting minor titans enter the wall and start chaos, the outcome of this event had Eren seeing her mother get eaten by a Titan which starts Eren journey to obliterate the Titans!\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8.5\\n\r\nI personally was a bit concerned with this at first; Attack on Titan was produced by Studio Wit. As a new studio it\u2019s usual that they start with less ambitious projects and I was preoccupied if they could handle a promising show like Titan; they went totally beyond my expectations! \\n\r\nDon\u00b4t get me wrong, it had decent animation, but when it needed to exceed their potential they did, that\u00b4s why SnK has God given action scenes! \\n\r\nAs it for the artstyle I can say it has a different aspect looking a bit more cartoonish than most of the anime, I\u00b4m not saying this is good or bad it just depends on your taste. Also this combined with a world filled with medieval atmosphere does work pretty well. The animation is one of the remarkable things about Titan, with this you can notice their high production value played a great part on the anime because if just help to deliver the viewers a more realistic environment to what\u00b4s happening. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 9\\n\r\nYou know that a soundtrack is good not just when it helps building up the atmosphere but when it becomes memorable, that is what attack on titan OST\u00b4s delivered to me. The OST does not reach the \u201ceargasm\u201d levels for me but it surely is one of the greats.  I also have to give them props for the voice casting, it just was right on spot with honorable mentions to Kamiya Hiroshi casting for Rivaille and Inoue Marina casting for Armin both with remarkable performances, being honest the whole cast has done an amazing performance!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nNow I come to the weakest part of the anime, I will just limit myself to talk about the main cast not because other characters are not important or I dislike them, is because anybody aside from the main cast of characters can die, even the coolest character if he\u00b4s not from the main cast he\u00b4s probably just there for the meat fest. This is really sad because there\u00b4s much more cooler characters the anime can focus on that don\u00b4t get that much screen time =(\\n\\n\r\nEren Yeager: Eren is our lead protagonist in the series, starting out being a character with a great determination that also felt very clich\u00e9 with this \u201cI\u00b4ll swear vengeance \u201cthing. Although he has a great determination he sometimes turns out to be useless at times, even though he has this special something inside him\u2026\u2026. \\n\\n\r\nMikasa Ackerman: Probably the best out of the three leads, Mikasa, is presented to us as a strong character not just physically but also emotionally. She also has this abnormal attachment towards the main lead Eren. She also takes part on some of the best scenes of the anime, just portraying how epic she can be.\\n\\n\r\nArmin Arlert: Last but not least we have Armin, which for me is the one who gains more development throughout the anime being from a total pussy to a mastermind who leads important operations for humanity.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\nAttack on Titan surely shows some remarkable work in a lot of its categories, but still is not perfect as people claim it to be it does enough to keep you eager to know what will happen next! Attack on Titan does not lifts up to all its Hype but this doesn\u00b4t mean that it fails to do a remarkable and enjoyable anime!\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5",

            "content": "I remember hearing about an anime called Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) and it's huge popularity when it's first season originally aired.  Naturally, I looked into it, watching a trailer and reading a description, etc, and found myself unimpressed (even turned off) by what I saw.  Something about those giants with their ridiculous grins and overall appearance did absolutely nothing for me.\r\nNow, two years later, and a sudden passion to catch up on my exponentially-growing backlog of anime, I finally decided to give this series an honest try.  After all, it must have gained all this popularity for a reason, right?\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very first episode, I was blown away.  Aside from the giants (or titans, as they are called), I found the artwork and animations fantastic, with the CG interwoven beautifully.  There was an instant, heartfelt connection to the main characters.  And the music was exceptional.  \\n\\n\r\nI had to have more, and more I did have, finishing the first season in only three days.  Overall, I couldn't have been much more pleased with Shingeki no Kyojin, and regret not having given it a chance sooner.  Out of 25 episodes, I found only one or two of only moderate value, while all the rest kept me on the edge of my seat with a mix excitement, shock, fear, grief, anticipation and awe.\\n\\n\r\nIt didn't take long at all to get used to the odd appearance of the titans, and even came to my own understanding of their purpose for it.  Outside of that, my only real complaints are story-related, in the sense that I just have so many unanswered questions (especially not having read the manga).  But the series isn't over after all, and I'm sure that the majority of my questions will get answered in the next season.\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin is almost non-stop action sequences and gut-wrenching emotional rollercoasters. Any anime that can thoroughly pull me into its world and make me so emotionally invested in its characters is a success in my book.\\n\\n\r\nI may have misjudged this anime initially, but next time, when season two airs, I'm going to be one of the first in line to see it!",

            "content": "One thing I would like to say before anything else, don't believe the hype.\r\nStarting off with the story. I find this right here to be half and half. As far as the background and history shown, and the world that was created I think it's really good. I liked the idea of humanity living behind walls, drove to near extinction, finding the overall story of the world to be pretty original in anime. However, on the other side, as far as the actual, episode to episode, overall story of the season... I find it to be very lackluster. The show forces shock value down yourthroat, showing mass death almost every episode, to the point where it seems like the makers don't know how to tell the story without throwing genocide or murders in every other episode. Aside from the forced shock value; there is barely anything worthwhile that happens in the story for the first season. Not to mention most of the season is composed of two 8+ episode arcs, which are very drawn out. I could go into much deeper reasons, but don't want to spoil anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and sound are both pretty decent. I find the art style pretty unique, although when it comes to the sound, aside from the first opening of the series I find the remaining themes pretty generic. The first opening does pump you up and in my opinion blinds people into thinking the show is going to be \"super epic\".\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters... I am not kidding when I say that the main characters in this series are complete crap. Eren is definitely the most boring main character, compared to a lot of others; I hated Sword Art Online but I thought even Kirito was more interesting than Eren. All Eren does is shout and preach, like he's the center of everything but has barely anything to back that up. And aside from his titan-related trait there's nothing else to him. I find Mikasa an empty character who only lives for Eren, who makes it seem like she can't even think for herself without him there. The only thing she has going for her is bad ass action scenes with her, which delude people into not looking past that and seeing a shallow character. And then there's Armin, who is a complete pussy and useless for the first 7-8 before he slowly starts becoming useful; most of the time he's shown he's either whining or showing how incompetent he is. He does get better down the road, and out of the three characters his is probably the best.\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan is apparently hailed as \"The Best anime of 2013\" and some going as far as saying \"The Best Anime Ever!\" When in reality, no. A lot of its' fans make it seem like that you have to fall head over heels for it, and act like if you think it's bad then you don't know what good anime is.\\n\\n\r\nNot saying this isn't a bad show, but I find it majorly flawed, and wish that more people would sit down and really think about this show before they praise it like they do. In my honest, serious opinion, I really am concerned about people who claim it to be the best anime of 2013.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan is perhaps one of the most overrated shows I have seen. Don't get me wrong, it is well worth your time, it just has been overblown by fans whose previous anime experience is most likely limited to Naruto and Bleach. Naturally this is all my own opinion, and feel free to completely disregard it. \r\nLet me get one thing straight though, this show is an excellent gateway for people trying to get into anime. If you know someone who wants to get started then this is perfect. \r\nRight so the story and setting are as follows. In aworld that resembles medieval Europe with little sprinkles of Steam Punk throughout, humanity has been forced to seclude itself in regions surrounded by heavily fortified and immense walls up to 50 meters high. Why you ask? To protect themselves from the Titans, giant docile humanoids that simply eat all humans they encounter and no one knows why. These Titans range in classes of  sizes with some being only 5 meters tall to the special types like the Colossal Titan who himself reaches up to 60 meters. \\n\r\nSo one average day where no trouble could possibly arrive from, the Colossal Titan and his friends the \"Armored Titan\" and the rest of the titan gang destroy the wall guarding our main protagonist Eren Jaeger's (pronounced \"Yaeger\") city and basically makes him have a bit of a difficult day to say the least. From here on he and his two friends Armin and Mikasa vow to destroy all Titans while they still live by join the military.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story and setting are indeed very intriguing and keep the viewer guessing, they suffer from some pacing issues where something that seems to be important gets disregarded and other events drag on for a bit too long in my opinion. I watched the show as it aired and the animation studio behind it \"Studio Wit\" did a great job and ended each episode with a cliffhanger making the week between each episode a tense and one that could not go any faster. However, there were some times where these cliffhangers felt rather cheap as the next episode would quickly wrap up the issue within the first  minute or so. \\n\r\nI have to give props to the manga writer Hamjime Isayama for creating such a fresh setting that really pulls away from traditional fantasy. The 3D maneuver  gear which the military use to fight titans are awesome gadgets that provide some of the best scenes in the show. Also the constant oppressive feeling that Attack on Titan delivers really succeeds in making you anxious about the future for this show. Hope always seems to cave in on itself. \\n\\n\r\nMy main issue with Shingeki no Kyojin is its characters. Going on the internet one will see that many fans of the show compare it to \"Game of Thrones\" for the show's ruthlessness regarding character deaths. This is true and in my opinion is meant to commended, however for that to be effective, one needs to care about the people dying. In all honesty I couldn't give a damn about the characters in this show, none are in any way interesting or go outside the common stereotypes found in anime.\\n\r\n In the 25 or so episodes of the show, the characters and their motives don't change since the first 2. Even the three main characters can be summed in one sentence by the end of the show. Eren is pissed off and hates Titans cause they killed someone precious to him. Mikasa is obviously in love with Eren and wants to protect him. Finally Armin is a guy too scared to fight first hand but has excellent strategic plans. \\n\r\nThe other side characters are barely worth a mention, even Levi who all the fans seem to fantasize over for being \"badass\" is just a sadistic douche. Admittedly he does demonstrate some serious ass whooping skill in the show, and that I have to give credit for.\\n\r\nWithout naming anyone, a person dies fairly early on in the show and every other character kept going on about how they miss them and they shouldn't have died. Truth be told, I didn't even know who the hell they were till much later in the anime. \\n\r\nI sincerely hope season 2 of Attack on Titan develops these characters more.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so enough hating on AoT for now, lets talk about the positives. Well for one, the art and animation. Studio Wit are a brand new studio whose first production is this show. I can only say that they must be comprised of artistic gods! The animation here is seriously the best I have ever seen in any anime. Many people complained about still shots being used during episode downtime particularly early in the show but Wit make up for it by delivering some of the most spectacular action scenes I have witnessed. There is something truly jaw dropping about seeing people zip around cityscapes in their 3D Maneuver Gear. I cannot compliment the animation and art in this anime enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also excellent. Composer Hiroyuki Sawano (also composed the soundtrack fro Kill la Kill) does an incredible job of emphasizing the setting with sombre and slow melodies accompanied by a some beautiful german singing to elevate the darker scenes in the show. Some pumping electronic sounds mixed with grand and epic choirs also get the hairs on your back standing for the more action heavy scenes. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all Shingeki no Kyojin is well worth your watch. While I don't think the characters will find their own space in your heart (not with Eren's constant whining), I do believe you will have a great time with this show, especially is you are a lover of action. I myself am incredibly excited for season 2 and severely hope that they fix up some issues with the plot and characters then. \\n\r\nIf you are going to watch, avoid the manga spoilers like the plague! \\n\\n\r\nThank you for your time.",

Whenever this anime is about the titans it's a really good anime, the sheer unstoppable force of them combined with the mystery of who or what they are and how they came to be carries the anime forward.\r\nUnfortunately the writing is dire. Absolutely dire. In episode 4 the writers actually have a character tell us what the personality traits of the characters are. That's right,they've done such a terrible job of getting this across that they just come out and tell us. You're so uninterested in the fates of most of these people because the anime spends no time building them up or ensuring you get to know them, and the action is less because of it.\\n\\n\r\nIt also suffers from endless internal monologues. The writers will just not shut up and show us something, they need to have someone sit on screen for three times as long as necessary and think it at us. In one scene one character monologues about how another is pale and breathing hard. It's insulting. It's a goddamn visual medium but rather than show us these things the writers vomit their awful dialogue all over everything.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately this bad writing takes its toll and the anime rather jumps the shark around episode 10. An intriguing ride up until then though, with some moments good enough to compensate for the writing.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime adaptation of the manga which won Kodansha Manga Award on the shounen category in 2011 and the utmost representative flag why kids nowadays will always prefer awesome action scenes instead good characters in a good story (we vidya now lads).  \r\nI try to at least be as objective as possible with these reviews, but in this case I can't not mention the constant annoyance the main character and his constant angsting about the things that happened in the first episode. Jesus Christ, his whole existence revolves around angst. Realistic portrayals of characters do not just use one aspectof them and blatter us over the head with that non-stop. There needs to be at least one high-moment to correlate all of the low moments. If he is in constant angst-mode and always shouting, it becomes meaningless and more of a joke or a running gag.\\n\\n\r\nNow I know. It is shounen. What do I even expect? But the straw of thinking too deep into it doesn't work this time, because even when you scratch the surface of these characters, they still seem to be completely uninteresting. There is no concept worth exploring here, no good idea hooking you to the adventure and what is there, is boring after a few episodes. \\n\r\nMost of the things like character-motivation, their development and the pacing just seem quite off. The characters like Eren, Mikasa and Armin are completely one dimensional and void of almost any interesting aspect. \\n\\n\r\nUp front, the more time passes between me, having watched the show and now thinking about it, the more average it becomes. I came to the conclusion, that the show severely lacks memorable moments. Many may call BS on me for that, but really think about it. Excluding what happens in Episode eight...I think, there was almost nothing for me to remember fondly. I'll say, that upon first completing the show, I quite liked it and would have even called it good, but that is just not the case anymore. \\n\\n\r\nAlso as enjoyment it's quite nice, but \"Enjoyment\" rating shouldn't be one of the aspects when making an impartial review and this is pretty much why 99% of MAL reviews are bad. There's plenty good stuff you could watch instead getting into this. After 1st season It gets insufferable -opinion even among the fans- so if you like action scenes just watch an american movie already.",

As far as the story is concerned, I wouldn't say it's the most complex or sophisticated one, but they played the suspense/shock card very well, and it is something that can obviously attract a lot ofpeople.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has very well crafted action scenes. However, because of that, most of the other scenes are poorly animated, to the extent where it looks like a student's flash animation project at times. Even putting that aside, I think the style of the animation as a whole is not particularly creative.\\n\\n\r\nIt is obvious why SNK is so popular, but it doesn't do it for me. I would say it's too much style over substance, and not meaning the animation style.",

            "content": "If you are looking for a light-hearted, revolving around boobs, sugar coated anime. Fuck off. This is one of the most harsh animes I have seen in a while. People you are introduced to are slaughtered, and these \"Titans\" are pure evil. From the first episode the Eren (Main Character) was traumatized by the giants, he has been acting purely out of guts and vengeance. Everyone fears the Titans and almost all run from them even if they are soldiers. Eren is an exception, his vow is to kill all titans and reclaim the world for the people. He has no natural talent but hesurvives sheerly off of determination and remorse. If you want to watch a badass gorey anime, look no further. The fighting system in this anime is extremely clever and original, I have never seen anything like it. It's no simple sword, gun, or magic anime; these people use technology like no other to fight the giants, although they must be skilled with the equipment. The animations are great, the art is different but not in a bad way, after one episode of this anime I grew attached to the main character, and every ending of an episode makes me want to watch the next episode more than the last one. Overall, this anime is probably the greatest i've watched in a long time, IMO this is better than SAO already(SAO was amazing).",

            "content": "The best way I can think of describing my experience with this show is that I found it profoundly uninteresting. So much so that I find myself in a position of being genuinely unable to understand why it is so well regarded. Which is unusual for me - I can usually understand the appeal of something even if I don't care for it myself.\r\nPerhaps the biggest issue that I find with it is that the cast consists largely of shallow stock characters. For me this is what really kills the anime, I think. I just couldn't find it in myself to care about anything thathappened because of them. This wouldn't necessarily completely sink an anime on its own, though it would have to have some pretty significant strengths in other areas to make up for it, and Attack on Titan doesn't seem to have any. The story of a young man being given responsibility over the fate of mankind due to a plot contrivance giving him sole access to or rare talent in some kind of great power is a very common one in anime, and within the first season this show does very little to mix it up at all. The tone is pretty consistently bleak, with levity being rare and unfortunately rather poorly implemented when it does appear, but for an anime that's so lacking in depth or original thought this just serves to make it even more boring. \\n\\n\r\nIts being so depthless and unoriginal is exactly why I find it difficult to understand why people are so interested in it. What about this show makes it apparently so much better than the mountain of other anime that have used the exact some concept and used it, to my mind, just as well? I suppose it could be the fight scenes, which are fine, though not particularly noteworthy if you ask me. Or perhaps the consistency of tone, which is honestly rare in anime and consequently kind of refreshing even if it doesn't really help the show much. But then I guess that the reason I'm writing this is because I don't know why this show is popular, so I certainly don't have any confidence in either of those guesses. If you enjoyed this show, don't hesitate to tell me what you thought was good about it. I'm honestly interested to know. For now though, I'm scoring it a five out of ten - I'm completely apathetic toward it. Because it does nothing at all unusual it can neither be said to be at all good or really at all bad. It's just mediocre, which when you get down to it is really the worst thing to be. I certainly don't intend to watch any future episodes of this anime.",

            "content": "Hello Lucid here,\r\nSo like many I also watched Attack on Titan. Wow this anime is so intense it reopens what anime is about and I want to focus on the emotion in this anime. Cause this anime has tons of it.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is original, as in that It has an unique setting. This world they live in is a hell and no one knows how it ended up being this crazy. So we as a viewer also don't know how all of this happened and why it's happening. Thus the basis for the story is set, we live in a world of fear where weare protected by huge walls from Titans that want to murder us and destroy us until none of us are left.\\n\\n\r\nNow this anime starts with the Titans breaching the wall and it sets the story in motion. Our main Protagonist now has a reason to fight these titans with a hatred not even Lelouch could match.\\n\\n\r\nSo we see these kids who join the Army and become fighters against the Titans. But what this anime does different than any other anime where the story is driven by revenge, is that it's so realistic. Now I'm not saying giant Titans are realistic but giant Titans fighting people who are but insects to them, well if you ever stepped on a bug how often did it fight back succesfully?\\n\\n\r\nSo we enter this world we know nothing about and we only see the POV of the main Protagonist who's only wish is to kill all Titans. So we are limited to  what he knows. And as the Story moves onward we learn bit by bit more and more about the world of the titans and how it all started. \\n\\n\r\nHere I have to say that all of this happens in an extremely slow tempo but it never bored me. Yes every episode ends with a huge cliffhanger so at the time I watched it I had to wait a week before finding out. And even then an episode could not even reveal what happened the week before. So if you can be patient like I am this anime will be the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nNow the Story is still vague and since I don't want to read the manga I don't know what is going to happen in season two. But that doesn't matter the first season of AOT was amazing, an adrenaline ride full of emotion. Where no one is safe from the wrath of the titans! (don't watch that movie it blows.)\\n\r\nSo the story is hard to judge, the synopsis is great and creative and this world is amazing with lots of detail. But yea until we get the answers I feel like I cannot judge an incomplete story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWell here is where AOT shines. The characters: So much emotion has been put in these characters. We actually see fear in this anime, something most anime don't seem to know. Characters are actually so afraid that they abandon people instead of playing the hero. People get confronted with themselves and trusting others becomes very hard. We also see the burden of these decisions come back to haunt those who made them. We see people cry out to the gods to bring back their loved ones. People scream out of fear or sadness in a way I want western movies to show us more. More is more in this case when it comes to emotion. But it's never to much, the emotion is never at a level where it becomes weird or unrealistic. No the emotion here is what I expect when we are confronted with our biggest fear: Death. How many will cower and how many will stand up in a failed attempt to save someone.\\n\\n\r\nYesh the Character development is rich, it might feel slow as with many of these episodes but it's there, it's subtle but I rather have it slow than hasted. People need to endure a lot before they can change and our main characters are young, therefore the confusion in their actions is what is so great about this anime. It shows a world I would never want to live in.\\n\\n\r\nAnime often offers a rich world that even though there is war, murder or agony you still want to be part of it, play the hero and look bad ass while you do it. Well forget that with AOT no one wants to live in that world, there is no place for heroes, acting like a hero gets you killed. No this world is fear and survival there is no time for happiness not when you're up against giant titans.\\n\\n\r\nNow as I said the Characters are rich and well drawn out. There isn't a single person I hate in this anime, they don't feel clich\u00e9 and they act never out of their own line. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound/Music, is simply amazing in this anime. Might I also add the lack of sound in some scenes makes the scene so much more intense. Yes this anime will shiver you with their use of sound fx and the music will push your adrenaline to a new level.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNow this is a beauty. The Art is AMAZING, rarely we see an anime this nice. Just look at some screen shots and you will see why this anime is living up to it's hype. Yes the Art adds all that is needed to make this so intense. And maybe best of all are the Action Sequences, I think that if we had this anime four years ago we wouldn't of had this kind of sequences it's perfect, just watch the official trailer and you get what I mean, it is as if you are flying with them and that is where I leave art at.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nYes this anime brought me so much joy, It's intense, it will bring you to the edge and even throw you over at some times because you cannot hold in. You want to scream like they do, you want to fight and punish like they try and in the end you just want to look away and cry. This anime gets weirder and weirder as it progresses and the story becomes more and more intense, and even when we don't know what will happen next it's still an awesome ride that everyone should watch.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Watching :)",

            "content": "When I look at the rankings of this anime, I am quite surprised. I was almost certain based on the praising reviews that was going to be a great anime revival show. I thought wrong.\r\nHighlights:\r\nSTART: extremely strong start, such a powerful first episode that immediately drew me into the show.\r\nPRODUCTION: very well done, no question about it. If there is something good to say about Attack on Titan/Shingeki no Kyojin it is certainly the animation, music and sound. Crisp and perfect. The animation has entirely no flaws, and the background settings are gorgeously animated. The music was another great aspect of the show, setting thecorrect tone at all times.\\n\\n\r\nLowlights:\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: super cliche, especially the main three characters: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. The reason that they are cliche is because all they do the entire show is talk about how much they want to eliminate the Titans, not how they would do it, but merely that they were going to with no possible ideas of how. Another thing that bothered me throughout the entire show was instead of cooperating and working out tactics of eliminating Titans, all I could notice about the conversations were that it seemed just like a \u201cwho can wear out their voice enough until they can\u2019t talk trash about the enemy any longer\u201d contest.\\n\r\nFOCUS: based on the ending of the series, I came to the conclusion that the first 15 or so episodes were a pointless plot. There was a new goal to accomplish after the first 15 or so episodes, and that was what remained entirely in the show.\\n\r\nPACING: slower than a three-toed-sloth. I could not watch full episodes at times because it got so repetitive and boring.\\n\r\nMORALS: the show has no message, unless you count \u201cwhen you get invaded by giant stupid naked people, fight back.\u201d The show pretty much seemed very anti-peace, even at the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you want to see a highly produced show, go for Attack on Titan/Shingeki no Kyojin. However, if you are destined to watch an anime with greatly developed characters and a pointful plot, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this one.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin, the anime that has brought forth a new wave of anime fans and stormed the anime world when it debuted in spring of 2013. An anime that was quickly subbed and added to Netflix after it's airing, that has gained the attention of thousands of people who normally do not watch anime. It has sold extremely well in Japan and the manga has profited well in the States as well. This must mean the series is something revolutionary and a game changer for all anime after it correct? After all it can't all be hype, there has to be some serious substancebehind all of this right?\\n\\n\r\nMost fans will tell you off the bat that it is not like other series, that it is heavily violent, shocking, and sometimes horrifying. That it is a world full of interesting characters and sudden death at every turn. And all of that is true...for the first five episodes. After an introductory which I would say is worthy of the praise it gets, the series seems to fall apart extremely quickly and after it's smash beginning has so substance left to support itself afterwards. \\n\\n\r\nI'll spare a summary of the story as it's almost hard not to know what the story is about by this point. I'll give you my thoughts on it in one word: Horrendous. To call the story mediocre would be too much praise. Out of the three main characters only one stands out as anything special, that being the character of Armin Arlert. However as interesting as he is compared to his two other mains, he is given significantly less time on screen to showcase this than the other two. The characters of Eren and Mikasa are without a doubt two of the worst characters ever conceived in any work of fiction. I would attempt to discuss their personalities but there is little to nothing to discuss. A standard cardboard box has more depth to it than those two, and would probably make a better lead character as well.\\n\\n\r\nIgnoring the horrific set of main characters, the supporting cast is dotted with traces of what could be interesting characters, but there is never enough time given to them to let that shine through. They glimmer with hope that Isayama's writing could be something other than pathetic and are one of the only things keeping SnK afloat in an ocean of fecal matter. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself must have been written by a fourth grader at best. The \"plot twists\" (even calling them that is a stretch) and sudden character death are all presented in such a shallow way it is often hard to care about any character that dies or any new plot development (hint: there are none, the manga is good at one thing and that is providing hundreds of questions and not a single answer). The entire pacing of the series itself is some of the worst I have had the displeasure of experiencing in years. The plot itself goes from moving at a sluggish pace and solving nothing, to a break neck speed where a character is introduced one chapter only to be killed off in the next one. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation jump between not bad and hard to even look at. The character designs suffer an often same-face syndrome worse than Araki's recent style and excluding background shots, the art is subpar at most and there is much more to be expected from a studio like IG Production. Their is a constant reuse of animations and scenes to such an extent that anyone would has this displeasure of watching more than one episode in a day would find incredibly bothersome. Reusing an animation once or twice is forgivable and almost expected, but to the extent they are reused in SnK there is absolutely no excuse.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is the only thing I can find hard to complain about, in a series where everything is so awful it is hard to even say something comforting about one of it's only good points. Which is an absolute shame as I can say the OST is probably the only thing to ever get from the anime at all.\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict on SnK will be a series of questions to ask yourself before watching it. Do you enjoy awful characters that have no depth and lack the personality of even a desk chair? Do you enjoy wallowing in absolute shit? Do you have any other reason to watch this other than to laugh at how utterly irredeemable it is? There is not a single good thing to say about the series other than that the first few episodes are \"not bad\", apart from that it would hurt to attempt to say anything good about this series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you still believe you should watch this show, may God have mercy on your soul, for you are going to need it.",

Insert shit tons of action and blood and other cool shit ??? == anime of the century. \nThe story itself is about this guy Eren who wants tobeat some titans ass. 5 episodes later he beats some titans ass. 10 episodes later everything is titans ass, and I don't know what the fuck, but it's pretty good. There is also this 9/10 chick Mikasa who is pretty, then cute, then sexy, then slutty, then hot. So the series definitely has character development.\\n\\n\nThe adaption relies on production values and yelling. We have action scenes, fight scenes, titan ass action scenes, titan ass fight scenes and action titan ass fight scenes. Blood, gore and flying body parts. Hot chicks, cool badass characters, insane and out of a mind coolfucks who are ON OUR SIDE. Ridiculously evil villains and faggots who just won't learn before main character kicks their ass! This is what I call quality entertainment. \\n\\n\nThe voice acting is bloody impressive. Eren yells louder than any other  shonen protagonist. He has ideologies and people need to hear it. I personally love these scenes. It's not that the loudest voice is always right, but when someone cares to shout it out loud that loud, you just gotta admit that the man has a point. \\n\\n\nThe music is fucking A. Even Mozar would say so. Whoever created the first Opening song is genius for writing a song which goes perfectly with anything and everything. This could be the OP of every anime and tv series ever made and people would say; Oh, boy, that is very fitting song. \\n\\n\nShingeki no Kyojin creates what all people who work in the entertainment business aim at: entertainment. Not just any entertainment, but some serious titans-ass-getting-beaten-while-blood-flies entertainment, and that's why it is the 12th best anime ever. \\n\\n\\n\nSauces \\n\n[1] Rishloo, Eidolon, 04 Pandora",

            "content": "Attack on titan\r\nStory- The story follows humanity\u2019s struggle of survival as it hides behind the safety of 50 metre high walls that has protected them from anthropoid beings known as titans for over 100 years. These titans are mysterious in origin and are massive in size. Their only goal is to kill humanity for seemingly no reason. After 100 years of peace, a breach in the outer of the 3 walls caused by a mysterious, previously unseen 60 metre tall titan pushes humanity to a desperate situation. \r\nWe thus follow the story of 3 teenagers, Eren, Armin and Mikasa and how they fit into thischaos. The first few episodes provide the viewer with an entirely new experience that will shock and change all you will naturally expect from an anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe first 7 episodes were pretty much the longest Holy shit!!! moments from what I have currently seen from an intro. But after this initial promise, the actual story unravels.\\n\\n\r\n Once everything settles down, the pace slows right down, the standard array of stereotypical characters are all introduced in 5 minutes and the story no longer develops. Humanity must kill the titans! Yup. That\u2019s pretty much it. The very nature of the enemy limits the story to just that, the titans can\u2019t talk, they have no morals. So all this anime can ever be is how Eren kills the titans. This is so unbelievably one dimensional it\u2019s a joke. With only one end goal, there can only be a series of extremely predictable single battles against the titans. And all of these suffer some serious pace issues. In the middle of a fight, the anime would stop to hear everyone\u2019s opinions. Or it would decide to watch countless flashbacks of traumatic family events. With the clear attraction of attack on titan being on the action, why bother showing this after we are all so pumped up?\\n\\n\r\n I have also read the supposed ending of the attack on titan anime series. My armpit has more creativity than that. Message me if you want the details. 4\\n\\n\r\nArt- this section is the most controversial in my books. Whilst the artwork is undoubtedly superb, i.e. the fight scenes and the environments, the underlying language of the artwork is flawed. Attack on titan is, as far as anime can be, very gory. People\u2019s heads and limbs are flying everywhere. But fighting these grotesque beings are a group of 3 teenagers (of which Armin is apparently a boy) who all look like they\u2019ve just worked out how to use a toilet. It\u2019s like watching ash ketchum go \u2018fuck you charizard!\u2019 and watch him proceed to break his neck. It\u2019s confusing. The design of the titans are, maybe intentionally, grotesque. But I am sure that there are better design potentials here. I\u2019m pretty sure I saw Nicholas cage as one of the titans. 6\\n\\n\r\nSound- the soundtrack is amazing. Suitably epic and upbeat. But there is no other dimensional quality to the soundtrack. Even when the main character\u2019s mum dies, an epic fight song is playing. The anime needs to learn, even in an action led story, more than action can exist. The beauty of friendships are poorly conveyed through the music for example.  The voice acting is the most over the top voice acting I have ever witnessed. It\u2019s not, \u2018can you pass me the water\u2019, its \u2018 (with lines and explosions encircling the character) I have failed you mother!!! I need the water to save my friends and to kill the titans!!!!!! Calm your tits already. Blimey. 7\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- defiantly not the strong point of attack on titan. The main character literally just wants to kill all titans to avenge his mother. A far more powerful character, Mikasa, starts of wanting to protect Eren, yet by the end, she wants to protect Eren even more! Wait, what? The only development we see is of Armin, who starts from a complete wussy to what you expect from a main character. All other characters just fulfil the stereotypical archetype that the writers have fallen for. It was so disappointing to see this after seeing such a unique beginning. 4\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- suffice to say, I did not enjoy attack on titan. I spent most of the time being frustrated by how slow it was all moving and how childish everything was. I was pulled in by the overwhelming popularity and amazing action scenes. What I was met with was a very childish attempt at making gore cool. Providing a lame excuse for teenagers to create a lot of carnage is not a good story. As awesome as the fight scenes were, they cannot make up for how immature it all is. 4\\n\\n\r\nOverall- I\u2019m really sorry for all the attack on titan fans reading this. But I am 18 and I have outgrown this senseless, immature and shallow genre. Whether I recommend watching it, I would actually say yes. The first 7 episodes are actually amazing. But the initial rebelling against the norm was quickly ignored and it drifted back to an average anime. 5\\n",

            "content": "The fact that so many bloggers still name Shingeki no Kyogin \u201cthe greatest or most significant or most influential\" anime series of 2013 only tells you how anime still is from becoming a serious art. Anime critics have long recognized that the greatest anime series of all times are Neon Genesis Evangelion and CardCaptor Sakura, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Other critics rank the highly controversial Aku no Hana over classic anime who were highly popular in courts around Japan. Teenage bloggers are still blinded by commercial success: Shingeki no Kyojinsold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. True anime critics grow up watching a lot of anime of the past. Shingeki no Kyojin fans are often totally ignorant of the anime of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that Shingeki no Kyojin did anything worth of being saved.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sense Shingeki no Kyojin are emblematic of the status of modern anime criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena and too little attention to the merits of real anime. If somebody composes the most divine anime seires but Crunchyroll refuses to hype it up and stream it around the world, a lot of bloggers will ignore it. If every teenager on MAL hype up an anime series which is as stereotyped as one can be but launches it worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on said series. This is the sad status of modern anime criticism.\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyjin sells not because it's the greatest anime series of the decade but simply because it is easy to sell to the masses: it has no difficult content, it has no technical innovations, it has no creative depth. It's just a bunch of gritty 3-minute action scenes which teenagers like to overhype and rave about how \"epic\" it was. If somebody had not invented \"Shingeki no Hype\" in 2013, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time to read a page about such a trivial anime which is mediocre at best.",

            "content": "First impression must be good. They always seems to be important because it sticks to memory and after that you'd want to keep going. I have observed this and know it to be true. This reality does not exempt the world of anime. Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime so it stands to reason its first episode must have a big impact. And with its animators bringing the big guns, possessing marksman-like talents, their aim was true and definite. Literally, I was blown away. Nope, not the wrong expression there. Literally and I mean I was literally knocked off my seat at that first scene,to be more specific, that first scene where they were spinning to increase momentum and put weight in their blades. Yup. It stuck on me. That scene was real time and it should be that way. The more real the scene doesn't really mean it's going to be good, but it's sure as hell more frequent than not give a shock and impress its viewers. And the pauses. That slow mo button pushed at that exact moment to be the most awesomest (yes, I'm aware it's not a word. It seems it's most appropriate in this circumstance) action pose was just right. No more no less.\\n\\n\r\nI have known some that say they'd prefer a manga and not its adapted anime because it doesn't take much time, tickles your imagination, and it's just going to be the same if not changed in preference to the masses or make rushed endings. That last part I really hate. I think the time you'd spent is wasted if the ending turned out to be rotten like a century old apple. It stinks and viewers, I assumed wouldn't like a stink'n ending. This is just basing on the probability that a rushed ending makes a more likely bad stories. This is true to writers of books, to be precise those discovery writer types.\\n\\n\r\n== Story ==\\n\\n\r\nThere is a tie in each episode. Since they follow the story line in the manga version, there is a continuous flow of scenes and like any other greats, there are always flaws, especially in a series. It lengthens. The words are long. Sometimes necessary and sometimes, to my opinion, not needed to say since it is so obvious. Like any young adult/middle grade types, the adults are useless. Well, apart from the main characters, pretty much all have no sense. The government, the citizens, some parents are made to be like babies that shows no common sense, making conflicts to our heroes in this post apocalyptic world where there is a desperate need of supplies and with monsters close at their fences, they become desperate, but of course, this exempt our heroes. No. They provide the sense like any other. But see. Here is the brilliant part. The writer created a grouping. The group where our heroes would end up is where its members would more like have the heart, compassion to its bros and sisters. \\n\\n\r\nI suspect there is still a second season. I hope. Since it's in demand, I assumed and the adapted manga is an ongoing magnificence. So the ending is not really the end of it. But, oh boy, that last bit. if you stay and watch at the last second, you'd get goosebumps. More so if you haven't read the manga.\\n\\n\r\n== Art ==\\n\\n\r\nI'll make this short. The art is just right. I have a feeling that this kind of style is destined for this series. But above all else, to me, it is the eyes that gives the most impression of all. In desperate situations, viewers would only look in the eyes to determine that deep despair that they most would likely feel when a 100 foot behemoth opens its jaws to swallow you whole. Or that hope for a faint chance that would get you out of that morbid situation. The eyes was a definite factor to me. It's not like those anime that gives importance to style so don't be expect'n one. Even without the hairstyle and fancy clothing, I always seem to identify them. Hinting that there is a faint difference on their noses, mouths, shape of faces, hair, and height, viewers is less likely to be lost.\\n\\n\r\n== Sound ==\\n\\n\r\nWithout fail, among almost all of its cohorts, this anime has good soundtracks. Though I have a little qualm in this regard. When there are monsters chasing you or some-like situations, it is normal, even expected to shout till your throats spasm. What I didn't understand is why would a person shout so loud when explaining his/her ideals, or wants, that to my impression, seems like a sound of being tortured, talking to their torturers. It was unreal. This instance happens a lot. Perhaps, I think more likely, it is to impose the emotion of the character. Less is more and this happens if it is within the bounds of common sense. My message to writers/directors. Go beyond the tradition, the accepted. More likely than not, the unpredictable and the new will impress, especially in the entertainment business.\\n\\n\r\n== Character ==\\n\\n\r\nThe hero is rash, stupid, and a hard-worker. He is determined. To avenge and rid their world with these giant parasites. He had a hard life, among almost all of the characters in this series, but even that, he has retained his humanity. He would save and be important like any other main character in any series would be.\\n\\n\r\nThe girl who follows the hero around (TGWFTHA.. hehe.. I just remembered, her name is Mikasa) is quiet. Silent but deadly. A talented girl that is most effective in killing not only the monsters, but any other living thing that inhabits their world. She pledged to stay and protects the hero, since sometimes, he is irritating and stupid. There are many other strong women that is focused in this series, a sure way to aim for all viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story moves in an exhilarating but sometimes boring phase, both would grow. They would change as their environments change. \\n\\n\r\n== Enjoyment ==\\n\\n\r\nThough the ingredients are just right to create that addictive taste, I was kind of hoping for a bit of romance between the characters. Not only from the change of pace of death/hopelessness, but also for an even more interesting interaction between them. Sure there are hints in it but come on, most viewers are teenagers. And when I say hints, from what I remember, I believe it is more singular. Hint. And even that, it was barely noticeable. \\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of like a Jurassic park, being that the characters are always chased, more or less, but instead of running for their lives, our heroes are running to fight. 'Tis memorable since without a doubt, the series is at the top of my list.\\n",

            "content": "Before I actually write this review I ought to confess that I'm a humongous fan of the series and might be slightly biased.... \r\nStory:\r\nIn the very first episode you get a false sense of being eased into this world nice and slow - getting informed of the characters' situation and a quick introduction, but before you know it a plot twist slaps you across the face so hard you can feel through the season both directly and indirectly. \r\nAnd about the plot - its somewhat simple yet eternally fascinating and intricate - ever evolving, you never know everything and it's certainly unpredictable to a frustratingextend, you never feel safe for the characters.\\n\r\nIt's not a cosy story, even though there are somewhat tender moments, this is a violent shounen and one of the very best, action packed and in your face. The plot is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic. The way the characters fly through the air and slice through their enemies is animated beautifully despite the gory nature of it. Of course these are the scenes that have been prioritised there are the ones that are less important visually where background characters etc, might look slightly funny, but it isn't really important or noticible. The scenes that you take not of and truly remember are remembered for their gorgeous animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing and fits the series so darn well. \\n\r\nThe German bit of the opening is so appropriate considering there is a rather large chance that the characters might be in Europe (where Germany takes up quite a large chunk, so who knows ?) and it gets you so pumped for the plentiful action scenes. It really sets the mood very well throughout the series, so well that it feels completely natural to hear the orchestra blasting along the soldiers flying through the thick woods.\\n\r\nThe japanese voice actors are quite suitable for the characters too, I've enjoyed the soundtrack a lot and listened to it more often than I'd like to admit. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAll the characters are so different and diverse, from Marco to Erwin, Levi to Hanji and Eren to Bert etc. It is so wonderful to get to know all of them, slowly fall in love with them and watch their loved ones die around them and fear for their lives too. Each character is completely unique and the characters are one of the best strong points of the series.\\n\r\nTo begin with I wasn't sure how I felt about them all, but after about one or two episodes with them each I fell head over heels. The character gallery is wide too, including lots of varied and strong women, though unfortunaly there is a lack of POC, an uncomfortable trend in anime. However some people view some of the characters somewhat stereotypical, I think that's only a first impression sorta thing, dig a little deeper and you'll find them all to be truly unique. Their enteractions are also precious.\\n\\n\r\nEnoyment:\\n\r\nI've rewatched the series four times in the last three months and I plan to continue rewatching it again and again untill the new season comes out in 27 years. I enjoyed every bit of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI enjoyed every bit of it. Love it.\\n\r\nAll the different components play well together and makes for an excellent show, very recommendable !",

            "content": "Well, I bought into the hype. This show lives up to it.\r\nStory: The world in this anime is amazing. A weird Middle Ages-type world, weird humanoid things running around eating people, weird cord-type devices used to move around like Spiderman? It's immersive from the start. The explicit material is insane and puts you on the edge of your seat--I gasped plenty times throughout the show, just for how brutal and insane the gore was. Also, this anime deals with an extremely mature storyline that seems to come out of left field (**SPOILER:** Mikasa's backstory), which I thought was a nice touch. Every episode of thisshow is completely interesting--perfect for a binge watch, though it moves kind of slowly towards the end. The underlying themes of corruption brought into this show at the end, which will (probably) be expanded on next season, made the show just that more interesting to me. Only one bad note--the military formation stuff got really confusing to me, but without going back to try to understand much of it I could still decipher what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in this show are mostly one-note and can be identified by one or two characteristics that they stick to in each episode: Eren is determined, Mikasa likes to save Eren a lot, says \"EREN!\" all the time, and is badass, Sasha likes food and is nervous, etc. I don't think this anime really *needs* a ton of character development, THERE ARE GIANT SKINNED HUMANOIDS EATING PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. This is a story-driven anime, though I will admit if there were complex characters it would push a wonderful anime into \"best anime I've ever seen\" territory.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Immersive story, gore and twists that will make you gasp and/or scream expletives at the top of your lungs, but one-note characters and some slow episodes.\\n\r\nOverall 9",

            "content": "It took me a while to start watching this for some reason. Finally got into it the other night, and I'm really not sure where all the praise is coming from. By episode 14 I was thoroughly engaged with the story and the characters. Sooo, what happened? I don't know the exact episode, maybe 16 or 17, but this show comes to a grinding halt. The story literally goes no where, the characters become stale and boring, and the main character, who was a thorough badass, actually regresses into an indecisive child. The show also has no ending. I mean I understand if they're planninganother season, but even so, it just ends abruptly with no resolution whatsoever. They throw a subplot in that occupies that last 5 or so episodes, and it goes absolutely nowhere. It was quite frustrating, as it all seemed very irrelevant.  \\n\\n\r\nIt was a good show, but not great. It didn't deliver in the end, as the story never really progresses once Eren joins the Survey Corp, and the characters never really go anywhere (and actually regress). There is only one really great scene in the second half of the show (church getting stomped on), and while it does deal with interesting themes, it's not enough to give it more than a 7.",

            "content": "This is by far the most overhyped anime I have ever seen. Before you fanboys attack me, overhyped anime does not mean it's a bad anime. It means fans exaggerated the status and quality of the anime by saying \"Greatest Anime Ever\" which is not. I admit, I love the show but it's not the greatest anime in existence. \r\n(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)\r\nStory: (8/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nThe story focuses on Eren and Mikasa as they witnessed a colossal Titan appear out of nowhere and started attacking the walls. The walls that have kept them safe for over a hundred years have now beenbreached and smaller Titans have flooded the city and started attacking the humans. \\n\r\nNow here's the reasons why I love the show. My first reason and very top reason is the fact that this is set in the post-apocalyptic world, where humans (mostly the Scout Regiment) are fighting the Titans and trying to bring their world back. Secondly, it's not just a simple \"Humans are defending against the Titans\" concept. Who knew there would also be humans who can also transfer into a Titan. That Human Titan can either help the human race or obliterate the human race. It makes the show even more exciting to watch. My third and final reason is the fact that the show is not afraid to kill off characters. I mean it had a few cliches were someone will save that character from being eaten but for the most part, you know that they're going to die and they're not coming back. \\n\r\nNow, the story pacing. Some might disagree with me on this but to me, it's messed up. The first 5 episodes, it was jumping around in years then later on, the pacing was normal, then the pacing went incredibly slow. By the way, I don't mind the time skips at the first 5 episodes because I understand that they were showing us (the viewers) how Eren is going to become a part of the military. Anyways, here's my problem with the story pacing. The 1st half seemed like a normal pacing to me. The 2nd half, however had the worst story pacing I've ever seen. It's too slow and it dragged on forever. The objective was to go to Eren's basement but it somehow turned into a Female Titan interrupting that plan for no apparent reason and this is where it dragged on until the ending. Why did she do that? I have no idea and this is where I'll switch subjects and talk about the plot holes. \\n\r\nThe show has a lot of plot holes and I'll give out a few of those plot holes. Where exactly did the Titans come from? How were they born? How did Eren's dad developed that \"Titan\" syringe and why did he give it to him?  How and why did Annie had the capability to transform into a Titan? If my theory is right, is the Colossal and Armoured Titans humans too? And so much more that I can't list them here. They better fill them plot holes at the 2nd season. Let's get back to the slow pacing shall we? I don't mind slow story pacing but if the show is not going to reward you with the knowledge that you gathered then you might as well not make the pacing slow. What are my thoughts about the ending? It was rushed, it ended in a cliffhanger and I was a bit disappointed. How about the plot twists? Yea, the show failed on this one. It was very predictable. One example is when Eren \"died\". I already knew that he didn't die because what show would kill off its main character very early in the series right?. Another example is when a mysterious Titan saves Mikasa and fights another Titan. I already knew it was Eren because of the hair and it's the only logical choice I have. Want another example? How about the Female Titan? I knew it was a human because she showed intelligence but who? I thought it was either Mikasa or Annie. I saw Mikaka fighting one of the Titans and my only choice would be Annie. When they revealed her true identity. I was like \"Wow, what a surprise\" with a sarcastic voice. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is very well done. The way they animated the action scenes, it  was great. It's very fluid. Especially when they use the ODM gears. Better than Spiderman. The character designs were also well done with some few minor flaws. How about the Titans design? My god, whoever designed the Titans, give this man/woman a medal. The first time I saw them, they were batshit creepy. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nNo doubt, a perfect score from me. Why? The music used in the fighting scenes are so well done. Both the openings are very well done. The 1st OP is awesome and the 2nd OP is great. I still prefer the 1st OP though. The 2nd OP did depressed me quite a bit. You'll know later on in the review.  The voice actors. I watched the show in English Dub so I have no idea how these characters sounds like in Japanese. One word. Masterpiece. Eren's VA which is Bryce (who also voiced Kirito from SAO) is so good. The way he screamed in agonizing pain, the way he shouts out of anger, perfect. I don't know who voiced Mikasa but great job to whoever voiced her. It perfectly fitted her character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (7/10) (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nThis is where the show kind of failed. As much as I loved the characters, there was a lack of character development. Eren stayed the same and Mikasa stayed the same. You know what, pretty much most of the characters stayed the same. Some of the characters were bland (not all) and some of characters are clich\u00e8d. Some fanboys might think that I hated the characters because I rated the character section 7 but I don't. I DON'T hate the characters because they were interesting to me. Like I said above, the show is not afraid to kill off it's characters. Most of the time, I would be shocked (only for the first 10 episodes) because one of the characters that had the potential to become my favorite character gets killed off. There is at one point where a set of characters from Levi's Elite Scout Regiment (Eld, Gunther, Levi, Olou, and Petra)got killed off by the Female Titan (Levi wasn't killed). Now, this is the point where I got depressed and felt sad for the whole day because they were the best group I have ever seen. I don't care if the Titans kills some of the characters because they're a bunch of cowards but these guys......why?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nAfter watching the first 8 episodes of the series, I already know I'm going to rate my Enjoyment a perfect score of 10. I was always on the edge of my seat every single episode and I never felt bored(except the ending). Everytime I see the \"To be continued\" screen, I'm like \"Noooo!!!\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8.8/10) ----Rounding it to--(9/10)\\n\r\nLike I said above, this is the most overhyped anime I've ever seen. People were telling me \"This is the best anime ever\" or \"Best anime in existence\". I can't believe I believed these people. Sure, I love the show but there is no way in hell this is the \"Best Anime in Existence\". I still recommend that you watch this show because it's jam packed with action and some emotional scenes but please, don't believe the hype like I did. Now my thoughts about this anime. The 1st half is perfect but the 2nd half.....I was a bit dissapointed because it dragged out for way too long and they never really achieved their goal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Great Story\\n\r\n-Great Animation\\n\r\n-Perfect Soundtrack\\n\r\n-Emotional scenes can sometimes hit you\\n\r\n-You're always on the edge of your seat \\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Little to no character development\\n\r\n-Bland and cliched characters (not all)\\n\r\n-2nd half's pacing is way too slow\\n\r\n-A lot of plot holes\\n",

            "content": "When I first saw this anime, I was utterly blown away. Not only did it prove to show that there is still hope in the anime scene not disappointing you with redundant, repetitive, milked out fan serviced themes but it does so with a main character that happens to be the least irksome to one's taste.\r\nThe story talks about the last remnants of humanity cooped up behind amazingly huge walls protecting them from gigantic monsters known as Titans. You are introduced to the main characters: Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert who are childhood friends that innocently dream of going beyond the walls anddiscovering the real world out there (just like any kid would!) This peaceful setting is disrupted when, out of the blue, a huge 60 foot Titan peeks from behind the 50 feet walls right at the puny humans and goes ahead to kick the gate that is sheltering humanity from the woes of the outside world that the Titans inhabit, wide open. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the story starts to unfold around the mystery surrounding these Titans and why they are adamant on \"eating\" humanity as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAll throughout every episode you will find yourself attached to every single character from here onwards. Some unceremoniously die, some have naive thoughts and goals to what they should do in life,  some want to take the easy way out of their strife, and some just go with the flow because they don't think they are strong-willed to fight back. All in all you will be attached to characters that exhibit real human qualities.\\n\\n\r\nSimple concept for a story, isn't it? Nope it ain't.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't your run-of-the-mill monster/horror/doomed humanity anime. People fail to realize that the Attack on Titan setting is exactly the same setting we all live in our real lives. It reminds you that anyone who is bigger, better, and stronger will not only devour you whole, but will also devour your entire dreams, hopes, and future with it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this main character, Eren Jaeger...this kid, you actually root for this wide eyed enthusiastic little bugger - who adamantly with all his heart wants to turn the tide whether it be for better or for worse. He knows that he has to FIGHT in order to go anywhere in life, and he isn't letting these monsters ruin his will to live; his will to take matters into his own hands.\\n\\n\r\nIt's very rare to have a character pump you up. It serves to show how willpower alone can do wonders - even if you are only human.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely breathtaking. The colors are so vivid and you honestly can't get enough of the lush background scenes. The action sequences were awesomely superb, especially with the surprisingly fluid 3D Maneuver Gear sequences. As for the characters the first thing you will notice are the EYES. They are so vividly colored and illustrated you can't help but find yourself drawn to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is simply outstanding. It fits very well with the mood of the story. Starting from the opening sequence to the ending credits. The BGM and SFX were especially very well placed whenever a character is seen flying around using the 3D Maneuver Gear. The ambiance and that feeling of dread that emanates from the music captures you from the very first episode. Honestly, if anyone hates the music I will royally Jaeger your ass!\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the manga, the anime didn't do justice or make way for any sort of character development. First timers wouldn't be THAT drawn to the characters from the get-go. But the development is still there, you just need to look closely. Yep, closer....OH there it is!  I do hope that everyone reading this review would give them a fleeting chance if any. If you're still not convinced, then go ahead and read the manga. You will be equally blown away, anyways.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't enjoyed an anime like this in a very long while. As I said in the very beginning of the review, animes nowadays have only cliched themes and seem to just bring out a yawn rather than any hint of interest. I've been so picky that I almost did not watch Attack on Titan (*GASP* the blasphemy!) \\n\\n\r\nIt epically portrayed a lot of simple concepts and elements that are most importantly HUMAN. It teaches you how easy it is to have hope inch further and further away from your grip and how easy it is to just give up. Though if no one around you is willing to stand tall and face adversity, it doesn't mean that YOU have to be scared out of your wits too.\\n\\n\r\nI urge everyone to watch Attack on Titan...then go ahead and read the manga, because if you'll be as hooked as I am then I'm sure you wouldn't even be able to bear waiting for the second season to come around the corner. \\n\\n\r\nHappy Jaegering!",

The show resembles Claymore in many, many ways which is the main reason I watched it but while Claymore scores lower, I still believe it to be superior in every way. \r\nAs far as the story goes, it's very basic. Giant people and that's about it.\r\nThe character's are the worst part of the whole anime bearing little to no personality and being annoying and/or useless almost all the time. They have this overly dramatic monologues and are constantly stalling the pacing with their \"going insane\" or \"I amso shocked\" dramas. While you expect them to react like this, it wears off very quickly and becomes irritating.\\n\r\nWhere it succeeds is the action. Great art and good fight scenes but even these suffer from the ever so often staling of the character's reactions.\\n\r\nOverall, I truly believe this to be over hyped and overrated but if you are willing to sit through it for the fights scenes then more power to you.",

You can\u2019t handle the truth. But I\u2019m gonna lay it out here for you anyway. \r\nI\u2019m going to break this thing down into three parts. The \u201ctropes lifted from every zombie media Setting\u201d, the \u201cclich\u00e9Characters\u201d, and the \u201cCircuitous, Shonen Storytelling\u201d. \\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nThe Trope Filled, Every Zombie Media Setting\\n\\n\r\nA while back, monstrous humanoid giants hell-bent on destroying humans struck. All but a few thousand humans were wiped out, waging a futile war against an enemy they neither understood, nor knew how to fight. Present day, there's one human settlement left, protected by three 50m high concentric walls, the largest among them 300 miles across, making it about the size of Germany. \\n\r\nOkay so, a little more info on these human killing giants, right? Because that was pretty vague. They have 3 qualities. \\n\\n\r\n1)\tThey kill and eat humans. They do not need to eat humans for sustenance, they just do it because the plot demands it of them\\n\\n\r\n2)\tNobody knows where they came from, or why, and it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m sure there will be some BS pseudo-scientific explanation for their existence later, because these type of shows ALWAYS take one of three paths: \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\n1.\tScientists did this! Biological weapon/genetic mutation experiments, who cares? It\u2019s all vaguely scientific and intellectual sounding, so that\u2019ll fool the teen demographic\\n\r\n2.\tA Wild Virus Appeared!

You can KILL them by attacking the neck/head area, just like some other TV shows and movies involving the undead\u2026 hmmmmm\\n\\n\r\nTitans are just zombies. Face the facts. This is a zombie show. It premiered during the height of zombie craze, and through shrewd marketing and an impeccable sense of timing, a hit was born. Did it have to be substantive? Heck no, all it had to do was prey on these little fragile children\u2019s emotions and \u201cOH MY FEEEELZ\u201d by killing off a few characters that we still know nothing about, nor formed any attachment to, along with throwing in a Gary Stu blank slate of a main character onto which these angsty teens can project themselves. \\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nThe Stupid Setting Part II\\n\\n\r\nOh wait, did I say Germany? It\u2019s plainly obvious that AOT is ripping off any and everything late medieval German Gothic and Renaissance styled architecture. Oh, and if the names and races of the characters didn\u2019t give it away, I don\u2019t know what would. Eren J\u00e4ger? Braun? Bertolt? Kirstein? Zoe H\u00e4nge? Also, it\u2019s quite amazing how these characters all speak fluent Japanese, given that they\u2019re all, except our token Asian character, Mikasa, German. Now wouldn\u2019t that be an innovative anime- one with Deutsch spoken and subtitled in Japanese? \\n\\n\r\nNow that I\u2019ve started listing names, it\u2019s time to get to the \\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nClich\u00e9 Characters Section! \\n\\n\r\nWe've got the not-so-subtly named main character Eren I'm-Going-Kill-Titans-Don't-Tell-Me-What-To-Do-You're-Not-My-Dad J\u00e4ger, who's hell-bent on the destruction of the oppressive titans who show up to wreck his life... talk about teen angst, sheesh. Eren\u2019s sole means of expressing himself in this show is \u201cGRRRRUUUAAAAHHHH I hate titans I\u2019m going to kill them all!!! (in order to keep X tragedy from happening again, because remember kids, NO shonen protagonist is complete without family tragedy!)\u201d \\n\r\nWait, where have we heard this before? What\u2019s that? Every shonen series ever? \\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a small cut from the block of trope that makes up the shonen genre, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nRin Okumura: \u201cI\u2019M GOING TO KILL EVERY DEMON, AND SATAN TO SAVE MY BROTHER!\u201d\\n\r\nKazuto Kirigaya: \u201cI\u2019M GOING TO KILL ALL THE BADDIES TO SAVE MY FRIENDS!\u201d\\n\r\nEd/Al Elric: \u201cWE\u2019RE GOING TO KILL ALL THE HOMUNCULI AND SAVE EVERYONE!\u201d\\n\r\nShiro Emiya: \u201cI\u2019m not going to kill anyone, but I will SAVE EVERYONE!\u201d\\n\r\nKen Kaneki agrees with Shiro, and they meet up with Shinji Ikari to hide. \\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nMikasa My-Plot-Armor-Is-Stronk-But-My-Sword-Arm-Is-Stronger Ackermann is our leading lady. She personifies the Silent Strong type. She only says two lines in the whole show: \u201cEren you idiot, I always have to save you because you\u2019re the main character and you can\u2019t die!\u201d\\n\r\nAnd \u201cWhy did I sign up for this job, again?\u201d\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nRounding out our trio, we have He-Man's midget brother, Armin I-Use-My-Mind-Not-My-Muscles Arlert. He\u2019s also hiding out with Shinji and Ken.\\n\\n\r\nWhen someone dies in this show, it\u2019s like watching someone kick a little puppy. They show you some little scene about the character and their life before, and how they\u2019re never going to go home to hug mom and their fish are going to starve now because they\u2019re not going to be around to feed them. We never get any attachment to characters who die because they\u2019re never given enough screentime to be relevant, or anyone we should care about. Of course, nobody that matters to the plot dies, either. \\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\\n\r\nJust when you thought this was about to get into some \u201cCircuitous, Shonen Storytelling!\u201d, HERE COMES THE \u201cCircuitous, Shonen Storytelling!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan isn\u2019t a 700 episode series like Detective Conan or One Piece\u2026 yet. With this pace though, and the ever intangible, nebulous goal (straight ripping off the fantastic David Fincher movie, \u201cSe7en\u201d) of \u201cWHAT\u2019S IN THE BASEMENT, MANNNN?\u201d Otaku on Titan takes a turn for the molasses. \\n\r\nWhen it isn't taking a 3 episode sabbatical of dialogue (in typical shonen fashion), the show does move pretty quickly\u2026 to boredom. If you\u2019re not getting angsty teens shouting at each other over why they have to kill stuff, or that they don\u2019t want to do it anymore, or crying over their lives; it\u2019s them killing stuff, then crying about their lives. \\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t forget to remember to mention that AOT is just a cheap ripoff of Neon Genesis Evangelion, did I?\\n\r\nPlot basics: \\n\r\n1)\tHumanity fights an enemy it doesn\u2019t understand, is whittled down to a tiny populace, and is poorly equipped to handle the threat, until one day\u2026 A HERO EMERGES!\\n\r\n2)\tHero has daddy problems. Hero\u2019s female sidekick(s) also have parent problems\\n\r\n3)\tHero loses loved ones which causes them to have to fight, even if they don\u2019t want to\\n\r\n4)\tConspiracy!\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nHere it is. I committed the ultimate sin and rated the beloved Attack on Titan a 5. \"Why? why would you do this, LawlMartz?\" \"Why would you give Shingeki no Kyojin a paltry 5 and not the 10 it so effortlessly achieved and deserves??\" they ask me. To this, my answer is simple. \u201cChildren, Attack on Titan is like any movie made by Marvel/Disney recently- sure, it's fun, it looks nice, and the masses love it, but at the end of the day, you didn\u2019t see anything new and it didn\u2019t leave a lasting impression on you, other than how immensely angsty it was.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan is honestly just too vanilla to really hate. It borrows from countless other shonen before it, and puts all the tropes in one pot, and comes out the anime equivalent of a hot dog\u2026 pretty good if you have no expectations or never had one before\u2026 but then you want something better afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s just call it Otaku on Titan and call it a day.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin or as it is more commonly known as Attack on Titan is undoubtedly the most hyped anime of the spring season and arguably of the entire year The hype for the show had already existed before the show even aired it first episode and it only shot up from there. This begs the question is Attack on Titan really the show that people notably fans of the show make it out to be?\r\nThe show opens up as humanity is being driven to the brink by man-devouring giants known as the Titans. Mankind has survived by caging themselves within a walled city inorder to distance themselves off from the Titans. When the Titans eventually do break into the city, our protagonist Eren Yeager vows to avenge his mother who had fallen prey to the mankind\u2019s predators until every last one of them is dead.\\n\\n\r\nI came into show not knowing what to expect from the show. I have heard of the manga but I didn\u2019t really think of anything of it at the time. I was initially unaware of the hype surrounding the show so I basically went into a show with a clean slate. \\n\r\nJudging by the first episode alone, the show looks to be a promising series. The introductory episode is pretty good and does an adequate introducing you to its world and characters. The animation was gorgeous especially during key moments in the episode. The music was a good with special mention going to the show\u2019s first opening theme, \u201cCrimson Bow and Arrow,\u201d by Linked Horizon that really does get you pump up to watch the show. The Titans are especially intimating with their grotesque designs but I would care for more explanation that hopefully latter episodes elaborate upon.\\n\\n\r\nThe show continued to impress with it aesthetics. The show always brimming with energy from its fantastic score to its very fluid animation. The score is helmed by none other than Hiroyuki Sawano who has his hand on other popular anime such as Guilty Crown, Blue Exorcist, Gundam Unicorn and among many others. He is one my favorite musicians to come out of anime and he works never fails to impress. His score makes the show a pleasure to listen especially during the various high-points throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is handled by both the up and coming Wit Studio and the more well-known Production I.G. They animation is fairly consistent which always a plus. What makes animation in this series really stand out is the use omni-dimensional maneuver gear which is particularly interesting and make for some very dynamic fight sequences. The animation team really put their best foot forward doing sequences involving the usage of them.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t really vouch for any of the voice work mostly because I am not particularly well-versed in the Japanese language but to my eyes the voice actors all the good with the material they were given. I have to give special mention to Yuki Kaji who voices our protagonist Eren. He never fails to make him sound especially creepy during those certain moments later on in the show.\\n\r\nHowever a show cannot stand own through these merits alone. If you begin to look past show\u2019s more shallow aspects then you start to see that this show may not as good as it is made out to be.\\n\r\nThe show had already grabbed me by it interesting but not entirely original premise. The world is under the heels of natural predator makes for a great atmosphere and is one of the finer examples of a dark fantasy in recent memory. Needless to say the Titans, the series\u2019 antagonist, behave very similarity to zombies. Thus making the show feels as if you\u2019re watching yet another spin of the zombie apocalypse which everyone has probably seen before. This is probably why the show has much mainstream appeal as the zombie apocalypse genre is quite popular here in the west. This aspect makes this show great for the casual view I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one area which the show really lacks and is its characters. While the show\u2019s many characters are quite colorful, they are pretty flat and don\u2019t really step out the boundaries of being mere archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nEren is yet another clich\u00e9d shonen protagonist who is defined by little more than his conviction to exterminate the Titans. While his convictions are understandable considering what he has been through but that is all he is. Despite all of his talk, he mostly all bark and no bite. Of course he get is obligatory shonen power-up and everyone turn to him to do anything noteworthy. However, he is hardly the ideal shounen protagonist. There really is special about him save for the fact that he is dangerously determined. His aforementioned shonen power-up doesn\u2019t win every battle and quite frankly does more harm than good. Above all though, Eren is just plain scary so much so that it actually becomes a plot point. \\n\r\nLastly, He is really same person he was as the beginning of the story to the end. He character doesn\u2019t really get much in the way of character development. \\n\\n\r\nThe a few other notable character notably Mikasa who would be a strong female character if there was more than her character than her obsession with Eren. I know Eren helped at a key moment in her life but that all she cares about really. She really isn\u2019t shown caring about anything else. It is almost a bit creepy. It got to the point that various characters in the show have taken note of this. Of course she is hold her own quite well but I really wishes she was wasn\u2019t over reliant on Eren.\\n\\n\r\nThen with have Armin who acts as sort the brain of the group. While Eren relies on sheer willpower and determination, Mikasa relies on her practical skills, Armin relies on his smarts. Despite this he really does contribute much to plot and is really just sort of there. At time when he does get to use his smarts, it really only there to point out things that are rather obvious and anyone with a brain could probably figure out.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other notable characters include as Jean who unlike our protagonist actually develops over the course of the story and Captain Levi who is a genuine badass but even they are truly notable. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast can pretty much be summed in a little more than few words. They are very one note and thus aren\u2019t too terribly compelling. Most of them quite forgettable besides for less than a handful of the cast\\n\\n\r\nOften character dies dramatically mostly redshirts you are supposed care but since we know so little about them are we as the audience are meet with is indifference. This show runs on a shock value to reel in viewers week by week which by itself starts to irritate you after a while making it less and less shocking each time it happens. It starts to become a regular occurrence.\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s pacing is notable for being absolutely horrendous. The episodes are often accompanied but rather lengthy recaps of the episodes before often being three or more minutes long. There are several scenes which notable padding where things are taking much longer than they should. There are several episodes where little to hardly anything happens until the very end of course. It is not as bad as some other shonen but still quite notable. That brings to me to yet another point.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a shonen through and through despite the show\u2019s overall dark and brooding atmosphere. The show attempts to tell a mature story with the inclusion of more mature and concepts that one can rarely in shows of its genre. The show is rather violent and grotesque for a supposed children\u2019s show. The fights especially between the titans are quite brutal.  However the show simply comes across as pretentious as tries to be more than what it is. The show frequently plays up some the more tired shonen trope and clich\u00e9s. In the end this only serves to hinder the show overall.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, the show looks pretty it really is but when actually start to look inward you\u2019ll find the show is quite ugly. Attack on Titan is by no means a bad show. It is certainly an entertaining show. It was fun ride to watch it week by week. It certainly fares much better than most of the anime to come out the spring season. That and unlike many popular shows of its kind its hype is not entirely unwarranted. There some good to be had here. \\n\r\nHowever despite all of this is not a particularly smart show. It has all the making to be a great show but what it fails at is certainly its execution. This is a reason why this show has garnered so much hype as most viewers aren\u2019t willing to take time to dissect it and only appreciate show at face value. Regardless, I will say this I would recommend this show but it is neither the best show of the year or what people make out it be. If you need a new show to check it out then this is certainly up your alley. \\n\r\nIt is a good show that wants great show but make a more than few stumbles on the way. It was fun ride though and I will be there when the inevitable second season heads our way.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n+Dark and inventive world\\n\r\n+Setting is certainly intriguing\\n\r\n+Likeable and varied cast.\\n\r\n+The music is fantastic and well-orchestrated. Does well to set up the mood of the show and highlight the various high points in the show.\\n\r\n+The animation is high-quailty throughout and especially scenes involving the omni-dimensional maneuver gear are very well-done.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n-There are some scenes where the animation is less than stellar though it isn\u2019t enough to ruin the whole experience.\\n\r\n-Horrid pacing which cause the show to drag numerous times during the show.\\n\r\n-Relies heavily on shock value.\\n\r\n-Most of the character is rather flat and one-note. Thus making it hard for viewers to care little or nothing at all about what happens to them.\\n\r\n-Despite everything it does, it still a clich\u00e9d shounen which holds it back from it true potential.\\n",

            "content": "Story - what I like - the premise 'humans vs giants' is simple on the surface but oh so damn complicated actually.  It's never just about fighting man-eating Titans.  The good guys also have to keep rich idiots in powerful political positions happy while using equipment with real world fallibilities.  (This is probably the only manga-anime that I can recall with swords that not only get dull but dulls quickly.)\r\nWhat I don't like - there are times when I wish that humanity isn't so goddamn stupid.  Am not talking about the good guys, but the rich powerful idiots in charge inparticular.  However, I'm tempering this complaint because corruption and decadency is very depressing true in real life.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s) - what I like - it has succeeded where most horror-suspense stories fail.  It made me care about characters who will most likely die.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I don't like - death flags everywhere.  People die and die gruesomely. Try to not get (too) attached to any of the characters. (Really, don't.)\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nArt - what I like - though the manga is infamous for having rough art (you can tell cause the mangaka kept on apologizing about it), the anime has gorgeous art and animation.  In particular, the battle scenes involving those jetpacks-webshooters.  (The animators researched by watching The Amazing Spider-Man in 3D.)  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I don't like - there are definitely times when you can tell that the budget is very stretched.  Hopefully, these will be improved in the bluray-dvd releases.  (They better be.)\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nSound - your ears are in for a threat!  The voice-acting is great.  The sound effects are great.  The OP and ED are great.  The background music is great.  The roars, the screams, chomping sounds, etc. - no complaints.  10/10.",

            "content": "\"Shingeki no Kyojin\" or \"Attack on Titan\" (AOT) has received praise from both critics and audiences alike. With this in mind, I decided to watch it and was seriously disappointed. Although AOT has incredible artwork and highly developed characters, it fails to deliver a good story. The plot itself is actually interesting and has a lot of potential to be really good, but the anime drags on and on, taking several episodes simply to cover one battle or one plot point. Furthermore, each plot pointdoesn't add much to the story itself, by which I mean it only adds more questions and gives no answers. A story needs to give answers to the questions it asks or that it invokes, otherwise it leaves the audience (or at least it left me) feeling let down. \\n\r\n                      Also, despite the fact that the characters are highly developed, I personally found it hard to care that much about them since most of them end up dying rather quickly, making all that development pretty much pointless. This also made me feel rather uninspired whenever a character gave some inspirational speech or rallying cry because even when they do that, they end up getting slaughtered.\\n\r\n                      Lastly, the excessive amount of emotional scenes took away a lot of their intended effect. I found myself thinking \"yes, yes, we get it, can we move on now?\" whenever these drawn out emotional scenes appeared simply because there were too many of them and they really desensitized me to the very real emotions that were present.\\n\r\nWith those things in mind, I will admit that the artwork of AOT is incredible, using a unique style and taking full advantage of certain elements present within AOT's unique world to create some very powerful scenes. Also, although the characters feel a little disposable to me, The characters are still very well developed and relatable. \\n\r\nSo it ultimately comes down to what your looking for in an anime. If your looking for a good, full story, i would recommend you pass. But if your more into artwork and character, then you definitely need to watch it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This is my first review, so bear with me.) \r\nSpoiler free, although you should know the story by now.\r\nComing from such an intense and thrilling manga series, the anime adaptation for Shingeki no Kyojin had quite a lot of expectations to live up to. I believe that it has met them in high standards. \r\nStory: 9/10 \r\nWhat I admire most about SnK is its ability to successfully and carefully demonstrate the notions of war and conflict. SnK is able to portray the many aspects and themes of war and conflict such as futility of war, human sacrifice (by this, I mean sending countless men andwomen to battle only leading to their inevitable death in the front lines), glorification and romanticisation of war by those who know nothing of the harsh realities of it, personal battles of the individual (this especially evident in Eren's development throughout the series), ethics and morality, as well as the negative consequences of war on the lifestyle in the home fronts. All of this set in a fictional Western European world. I recommend reading the poems of Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon to further appreciate the brilliance SnK has achieved to explore the previously listed themes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe art was definitely candy to the eyes. It was satisfying to see incredible battle sequences between the army and the titans. I particularly loved the attention to detail in animation of the 3D Manoeuvre Gear. Character designs were also to be applauded for. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe voice acting cast are to be commended. Being a big fan of the manga, I was impressed with how fitting the voice actors were for their characters, especially for Eren and Hanji. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this anime is brilliant, one of my favourites. Hiroyuki Sawano does an excellent job to just intensify any scene. A few tracks in the German language just add onto the atmosphere to the setting of the anime, giving the audience a more thrilling experience.\\n\r\nAlso, both opening sequences (especially Guren no Yumiya) by Linked Horizon may be one of the best opening sequences ever. The songs were so catchy and while I usually watch through all OPs of any anime I watch, it should be illegal to skip SnK's openings (and endings). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 \\n\r\nSimilar to the story section of my review, I admire how SnK has been able to successfully show how war and conflict impacts the individual, in more ways than one. It was interesting to see how the events of the story affected each character and how it adds to their development. You have someone who struggles to find what is right and what is wrong as well as having an enormous amount of responsibility on their shoulders. You have someone who excels in learning and sensibly adapts to any situation. You have a strong willed, stereotype breaking, and brave female who is able to find strength in the worst of times. Then you have a few characters who lose their humanity, in order to save humanity altogether. As well as the relationship of the characters amongst each other, the titans, the townspeople and the mysterious father, it is a well-balanced group of characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this, more than I thought I would. Each episode leaves me emotional and wanting more. The pace of the story, especially in the second arc, was done well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 \\n\r\nI can't say anymore for this anime. It was just brilliant. That's all there is to it. \\n\r\nPersonally, I'm a big history buff and because of that, the whole notion of war and conflict in this anime was very pleasing and satisfying. SnK achieves so much in such little time it has and I commend it for that. Depending on how the series will end on Sunday (I have a few guesses), it has a lot of space and opportunity to continue onto a second season which I have no doubt would be as astonishing as the first. \\n\r\nI definitely recommend this series to anyone and everyone!",

            "content": "Why Shingeki no Kyojin might not be the epic you were expecting....\r\nAnd why it might be.\r\nShingeki no Kyojin or, Attack on Titan was produced by the powerhouse studio Production IG in the spring of 2013. It was instantly a smash success even gathering attention for the casual western masses. By now the summer of 2014, there is even a Hollywood movie in the works.\r\nThis review will solely focus on whether this anime will meet your understandably high expectations. For some of you it might, for others like myself you might be left scratching your head. Let me make myself clear before I begin however. Iin no way disliked this anime or, have any ill feelings towards it. I rather enjoyed my first time watching the series all the way through, I've even read the manga in between my first and second viewing.\\n\\n\r\nWith that all out of the way I'll begin!\\n\\n\r\n;Story~!\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Shingeki no Kyojin isn't a hard one to grasp. Humans fear Titans, Titans eat Humans. Admittedly there is a little more behind this including an intriguing enough mystery. Though you rarely get enough bones thrown your way throughout to remember there is a greater mystery. \\n\\n\r\nThe story all revolves around Eren Yaeger, a understandably pissed off young man. His goal is to kill all of the titans and trust me, he means ALL of the titans. The story starts off very slow but it doesn't take long for shit to hit the fan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this story had potential but I think a lack of execution in a lot of areas hinder it. Especially the pacing. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 5\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\n;Art/Animation~!\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from a studio like Production IG the animation is top-notch. Everything looks like it is high quality which I feel greatly enhances the series. The characters all look exceptional to decent, the titans look morbid and creepy (with the exception of that horrible kawaii titan), and the battles scenes are absolutely bananas. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Armin's haircut makes him look like a dork this still passes with flying colors.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\n;Soundtrack~!\\n\\n\r\nThis was easily the best thing of the whole series. And it was probably one of my favorite soundtracks from last year. It did leave you feeling like what was happening on screen was a big deal. The soundtrack actually made me feel really emotional during scenes, the scenes otherwise never would have made me feel in such a way. The soundtrack played a huge part in getting me through my first watch content and with little complaints.\\n\\n\r\nFor a soundtrack to do all of these things is very special. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\n;Characters~!\\n\\n\r\nThis has to be the most frustrating part of the whole series for me. I'll focus on the central characters before giving an overview.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with our main trio of Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. All of these characters were painfully one-dimensional. And I don't accept Mikasa's backstory at all, I know it is fiction, I know it is anime, but in a world grounded by brutal reality I can't suspend my disbelief for Mikasa. By all accounts her parents were normal human beings, she transformed at the flip of a switch to a killing machine? I can't buy it. She also has the personality of cardboard, I felt absolutely nothing from her. And when I say nothing I mean nothing, no suppressed feelings, no real desire, she was just there. There to be the badass protagonist really, very much a female Levi. They're pretty much the same person. Admittedly I find Levi much more interesting though we are given little to nothing about his character, which is a problem that plagues the series.\\n\\n\r\nArmin while having the most potential of the three is just typecast as the cliche crybaby coward. If you want more prove look at the American voice actor chosen to play him, Josh Grelle. *Shudder.*\\n\\n\r\nLastly is our main protagonist Eren! Once again it just feels like he is making up the last third of a trio with set cliche personalities or lack there of. Most of the time I just found him to be a nuisance while trying to watch the series. Annoying main protagonists aren't uncommon now a days but Eren Yaeger is very tiresome after a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow as I said some characters I found interesting or with potential. The best among them being Annie Leonhart and Jean Kirstein. I understand perfectly well that some of these characters are going to be titan food, but why not develop them before then? It felt like none of these characters were properly constructed. From the bland personalities to the lifeless dialogue, the writing in this wasn't at all what people give it credit for.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 3\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\n;Overall~!\\n\\n\r\nWould you be surprised to hear that I enjoyed the series?\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't exactly deep or, thought provoking still I found it to be very fun. Honestly it doesn't have a lot going for it aside from epic eight episode long heart pounding battles. But what is so wrong with that? \\n\\n\r\nDoes it deserve the hype? \\n\\n\r\nWith the dub coining it \"the Japanese, Walking Dead,\" I think saying it does from my point of view would be laughable.\\n\\n\r\nDo I get the hype?\\n\\n\r\nI certainly get it. The soundtrack is enthralling, the animation is quality, the surprising moments really get you. I understand why there was so much hype surrounding this series. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are like me, you might be looking for the deep masterpiece of a story everyone has told you about. You won't find it here.\\n\\n\r\nBut~!\\n\\n\r\nI certainly recommend it to those who don't mind shutting their brains off to enjoy a hell of a ride. \\n\\n\r\nFor that I give Shingeki no Kyojin a solid...\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 5/10~!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin, otherwise known as Attack on Titan. Now throughout the months before I watched this show I have heard so much good said about it, as in one of the best anime's in the past few years, but, I do not think so at all. Though this show had outstanding visuals that I agree are better than all of the anime's I have seen to date, It has more faults than goods. I will explain why below.\r\nA world where ferocious creatures known as Titans attempt to eradicate humanity who are safely put behind the 3 enormous 50m Tall stone walls (that also reachbelow bedrock level), Sina, Rose and Maria. Maria having a circumference of 1570.8km (I did the math) with Rose inside Maria and Sina inside of Rose. Not even going to bother calculating the length of them, I can't be bothered. Anyway, the story takes place around a young man named Eren Jeager and his struggles among his companions to fight off the Titans.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I go into negatives, I want to point out the positives. Visuals and animation style are perfect, could not be happier about that. The level of epicness does not cease to amaze me. The way the Titans are depicted and how the humans perceive them is extremely well done, they truly do make the most frightful enemies in Titans. They are unstoppable, absolutely terrifying beings with nearlly zero weaknesses. Well done, and for this I give you an instant boost to 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nNow to the negatives.... oh the amount of potential, the amount of plot wholes is just staggering! First thing I thought of was, where did the walls come from? How could anyone make them? Especially if all this started only a century ago... It would have take a millennium to make it in the first place, that is without the distractions of constant Titan attacks that would have wiped out humanity within an hour of even attempting to build the walls... where did the Materials come from? \\n\\n\r\nAs for all the other more obvious questions that were brought up throughout the series. None of which were answered either... The show seemed to drag on secrets and appropriate information without telling us anything. Where did the Titans come from? How do people turn into Titans? What's in the basement? What happened to Colossal Titan and Armoured Titan? Who were they anyway? Why did his dad keep that a secret? \\n\r\nWHERE DID THE WALLS COME FROM! WHY! HOW! WHY! HOW!\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but from watching it I could just imagine all these wonderful story arcs and possibilities that were just thrown out the window and instead of answering all the relevant questions in the back of my mind, they just went on to do something equally and completely irrelevant. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, though the visuals were stunning, they were the same! The environment only ever changed once. From cities of stone and the wall, to empty grasslands and some forest, that still looked exactly the same no matter what angle you put it on.... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development. You mean, see this pretty person, HA! Jokes! they all died. I think this show tried to hard to be epic and sad when it killed people, which it does a lot. Average episode death count is estimated around 500. I wasn't connected to any characters, in fact I couldn't care less about them, which is (ironically) sad because I think the show tried to make you feel sad when they died. I just ticked my list, \"Oh... so he's dead, oh and so is she... oh and that guy too\". Why is it that none of the characters despite Armin develop or even change throughout the entire series? And I didn't even like that guy... Should I also mention the constant flashbacks and monologues? Like seriously, they are good every now and then but not every 5 and a half seconds...\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on for a little more but I think that's enough ranting for now. Starting from it's positives, the only reason why I continued to watch this show, I give it a 10/10. But when it comes up to everything else, it drops to about 6/10. So much potential, and absolutely no questions were answered, and the world hasn't really become any safer. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like to watch something that looks pretty and has a cool world setting, this is the show! But if you don't want to pull your hair out from frustration for 8 and a half hours, I suggest you steer clear. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, 6/10. Good, enjoyable, but frustrating with too many faults to count",

            "content": "Attack on Titan Review:\r\nI was well aware of the hype this show had gained in its first few episodes back when they originally aired. When it was already in the top 10 on MAL before even a quarter of the show had happened, I was actually annoyed. I thought: \"How dare people disrespect all these great shows by giving something that isn't even finished a higher rating.\" However, after waiting for the show to finish so I wouldn't have to endure the grueling torture that waiting for a new episode each week, I must say.... This show is fucking brilliant.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nYou all know the premiseof AoT's story. Humanity is pushed to the brink of extinction by giant monsters called Titans and all those people who remain live inside these giant walls. Then one day a big ass titan decides to kick a huge hole in one of the walls and the titans once again begin wreaking havoc. In steps the main protagonist who has had some sort of traumatic experience due to the titans, and BAM, you have a story of a kid trying to avenge his mom and save the world. I know lately the post-apocalyptic setting has really been beaten to death primarily due to the Walking Dead's success, and quite frankly I was getting sick of it. On the surface, this does seem a lot like another zombie show (albeit with giants instead). But in reality, this show takes a well-known premise, and absolutely masters it. By focusing on the harshness of death, and not just killing people to kill people, the show shines. The show has a very dark tone. Plans rarely turn out good, and never end up perfect. This high level of despair mixed with small amounts of hope really match the setting and are a perfect tone for the story.The first few episodes are BY FAR the best start to a show that I have ever seen. Attack on Titan doesn't hold back an inch and thrusts you into the intensity of the story from episode 1. If you are someone who hates a show that ends every episode with a cliffhanger (think Code Geass), then you will not like this show. But for those of you who love sitting on the edge of their seats for a 10 hour marathon session, get ready to watch this show. Another extremely important part of the show's story that helps it stand out, is just the setting in general. The humans really do seem like they are caged in within the walls and lack freedom. Add on all of the hierarchy and corruption within the walls, and the world alone is an extremely intriguing place. Add on the constant fear of a Titan invasion and the world really becomes a place that you just don't want to live in. As for the ending, it was relatively satisfying, and did a nice job of setting up the second season. Obviously, it is too early to tell if there will be any plot holes, and it can be assumed that all unanswered questions would be answered in season 2. Overall, the story was brilliantly done and is the best in the \"post-apocalyptic/monster\" genre by far.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nAttack on Titan has a very distinctive art style. The character outlines are thicker than normal, giving them a strong definition, and is a unique trait to the show. Titans were also very creatively made, looking similar to humans, but with larger heads and the creepiest facial expressions known to man. However, more parts of the art were the representations of the world and events in it. First off, the characters are all from a slew of different ethnic backgrounds, ranging from German, to Japanese, to Swedish, to who knows what. But the characters all had traits in their design that helped identify where exactly they were from. Also, the world itself was very well thought out. The inside of the walls are filled with bland colors like brown to represent the despair and cage-like atmosphere of the place. What was most impressive were the action scenes and what came with them. The scenes with the maneuver gear were absolutely stellar. A balanced blend of cg into the scenes really helped the fast paced nature of the maneuver gear shine. The blood and just shear brutality of the violence was also some of the more effective gore I've seen in anime. Attack on Titan shines in the art department for bringing such an intriguing world to life.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nMuch like with the art department, I was blown away by the soundtrack to this show. Not only are the intros and outros all fucking amazing, but so are the rest of the songs. There is a solid balance between instrumental and vocal tracks, and they are all used with perfect timing with each scene. The music greatly helps change the mood of the show, especially when they want us to feel upbeat and hopeful for the characters... only to later kill all of our hopes and dreams. I really don't know what else to say about the OST besides that it is bloody fantastic. Once again, I am no expert on Japanese voice acting, but they were all good enough to not make me laugh or scoff at their performances. A trend is forming here, the sound department also gets an A.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10:\\n\r\nHere is where some people may disagree with me. A lot of people think that the main three characters, and maybe even the side characters, are too one dimensional to be rated this high. I completely disagree. First, we have Eren, who's mother is eaten in front of him when the Titans breach one of the walls. This traumatic event is one of the key motivators in why Eren wants to join the Survey Corps and kill the Titans. However, he has also been strongly influenced by Armin's interest in the world outside of the walls, and hates the feeling of being fenced in like cattle. Next there's Mikasa, Eren's adopted sister, who I believe is one of the best female characters in an anime to come out in a while. In a world where 99% of female characters are injected with Moe-roids or are tsundere, a character like Mikasa is refreshing. I understand she can seem insane when it comes to Eren, but try to think of it from her perspective. Like Eren, try to imagine having your family get brutally destroyed in front of you. After losing her first family, all she now cares about is protecting her new one in Eren, even if it means losing her life. These two characters show how much traumatic events can effect people, and how far they will go because of them. Armin is another main character who gets some criticism due to him coming off initially as a pussy. But Armin grows throughout the show, and learns that he's not as useless as he once thought. Really, all the characters (who survive), change and grow from where they were episode one to the end of the series, and that is what makes them special. Another huge part of what made the characters great though, was the attention put into the side characters. Every character has a back story, has fears, has emotion, personality, and everything else that could make them easy to relate to. Side characters in this show aren't just there to be killed off (even though ANYONE can be killed), every person is significant in providing insight into how brutal the world really is. Whether its the fear they have after seeing their first Titan, or the despair they feel when their best friend dies, the characters all display human traits, and aren't just there to be there. The side characters drastically help provide depth to the setting, displaying all of the selfishness, corruption, despair, and hope that the world they live in contains. Something random that I noticed during a big battle scene, was that when buildings were being crushed, and havoc was wreaking in a city, they didn't just show buildings getting destroyed like they do in most shows/movies. They actually showed the bodies of people in buildings flying out, the blood spilling, and just all of the real, disturbing stuff that you would see if something like this were to happen. The main characters were easy to sympathize with, and most importantly, the others were treated as people instead of objects, and that is why I gave this section such a high score.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nWhen a show makes me SHAKE while watching, I know it is intense. There have only been two other shows to make me feel this much anxiety and excitement, those being Code Geass, and the 2nd half of Steins;Gate. The thing about Attack on Titan though, is it takes the action from Code Geass, and adds the psychological aspect of Steins;Gate, making one hell of a ride. I feel sorry for those of you who watched this show on a week to week basis, because basically every episode ends with a cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more. Marathoning this show is really the best way to watch it, and its pace makes it feel more like one big movie than a tv show.The world and characters made me really think about what I would do in this situation. Attack on Titan really hits all the marks in the Enjoyment category: intensity, emotional impact, humor, wtf moments, etc. The only thing it really lacks that I really enjoy is a romance, but with it exceeding so well in every other aspect, I truly enjoyed this show as much as most of my other favorites.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation:\\n\r\n+.2 Buy it\\n\r\nBuy this show. Actually, I would wait til season 2 airs and is over, then buy both of them regardless of how good season 2 is. I'm not saying that because I'm confident s2 will be great, but more because I'm gonna hate waiting for season 2 to come out. I just wish season 2 was out already! The anticipation is killing me!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.4/10:\\n\r\nAttack on Titan is a work of art that deserves all the praise it has been getting. Both action packed, and thought provoking, the show is truly amazing. By no means am I declaring this show the greatest of all time like many seem to be doing. But Attack on Titan is nothing to be laughed at. Honestly, anyone who says they didn't like this show is probably trolling. After all that writing, I'm not sure what else to say besides \"This show is fantastic, stop watching porn and go watch this!\" All I can say is that I hope that Attack on Titan can be wrapped up in two seasons because I won't be able to handle the suspense of waiting for a third season.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nAn intense ride that blasts off from episode 1 and never looks back.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Intriguing setting/concept\\n\r\n+ Death and gore is purposeful and powerful\\n\r\n+ Fantastic OST\\n\r\n+ Amazing action scenes\\n\r\n+ Characters are extremely human\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Unanswered questions left for season 2\\n\r\n- Main characters can appear 1 dimensional\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Attack on Titan, watch...\\n\r\nFullmental Alchemist Brotherhood:\\n\r\nBoth shows are intense and action packed, with the main male leads both being primarily motivated by the deaths of their mothers.\\n\r\nSpiderman:\\n\r\nmaneuver gear = web swinging\\n\\n\\n\r\n9.4/10 - Brilliant",

            "content": "I usually do not overlook popular anime in my time because I hated overrated shows with fan service, dull action scenes, stupid harem, clich\u00e9 characters, flat plot with hideous endings and the same theme over and over again. Originality must be a priority to storytellers, writers and whatnot; however, some just never learn to see that way. I never intended to watch series that exceed 200 episodes that leads to nothingness and endlessness. It seems that the plot remained unfinished by adding fillers and a large amount of recaps. Animes like Naruto, One Piece, any more never ends any more. In my case, I donot watch them because of reasons like too many episodes, fillers, overrated, hentai and a lot more. \\n\\n\r\nShingeki No Kyojin has been a well-known anime of 2013. My friends and classmates are all talking about it. Social Networking sites share its photos, quotes and captions. Some would even start buying its merchandise. I had doubts about it but because I was bored and curious by its title and art, I eventually dipped in to its mud of adventure; thus, taking a long ride of a new mysterious story. \\n\\n\r\nImagine yourself reading a book in your room or watching anime or doing chores then suddenly a huge man-like creature appears and grabs you by the hand and intends to feed on you. The plot can immediately be caught on its title, \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d which obviously means that characters will kill titans. But what are Titans and their true nature? The story remains hidden unless you watch the anime. On the other hand, it\u2019s not only about attacking but there is a subplot too. Friendships and families will be broken. Chances of survival are risky in this anime. Choices and decisions will be hard to make. It is a bit unexpected because you will wonder if they will live or if they are going to defeat the Titans. I give the story a 9.7 just because the ending is a bit flat and there are major points that were missing. It is also lacking its comedy factor but I think that\u2019s why people love this show. It sticks to its plot and it is so serious that you will get hooked by it without thinking that it is a detective themed anime. Let\u2019s just hope for a second season because we really want to know the mystery behind the Titans. \\n\\n\r\nArt is just beautiful. It\u2019s not the typical wide eyed anime characters with big head and super thin bodies and shitty moe. It is just astounding and unique. Not all graphics can be this good. Dark outlines and creative backgrounds are maintained in this show. Trust me, you will be indulged. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is quite creative. The main theme is like the Sound of Silence kind of tone because of the god-like humming. There are English lyrics in the background music as well which makes it memorable but in my opinion I didn\u2019t really find the Openings and Endings interesting because they may be related to SNK\u2019s aura and story but I just can\u2019t help but think that it lacks its WOW factor. Voice actors were full of emotions so no questions asked and no problems there either. \\n\\n\r\nI can see why they like this show, the characters were well written and made. They were all emotional human beings like us. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t panic after seeing your parents being devoured by giant creatures. Creepy, right? Some characters are undeniably crazy and have different personalities that I know you guys would love. Main characters were likable. I specially loved Eren Jaeger because he is the realest man I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime show. He isn\u2019t a pretender and he fights for what he believes in. Other than Eren, Levi is also one of my favorites. He looks cool and he isn\u2019t overreacting. Also, Mikasa and Armin are lovable too. It\u2019s funny how these characters act like true human beings with feelings despite the fact that they are works of fiction. I didn\u2019t hate some of the characters but hands down to the antagonists because they were despicable. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime even though some episodes were boring and episode 13.5 was a replay (blow off). I like the fact that it proved that fan service isn\u2019t needed to make an anime fun to watch. Action scenes were high appreciated in this show. It was totally uncalled for. I never would have wanted more action in my life. It was nothing I could ever imagine. It was better than I ever expected. I expect that it was a total let down and that people are being overrated but I ended up eating my words. It is also good that it stick to the story and that romance isn\u2019t the target of the show. I just wanted a better ending that\u2019s all. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was fascinated by it. To those people who still haven\u2019t seen SNK should be literally eaten by Titans. It is by far the best anime of 2013. I say that even though I haven\u2019t seen all the anime aired in 2013. I would be happy if everyone would watch it so if you\u2019re reading this review, promise me that you will watch SNK.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review on this site, so please be kind. No huge spoilers below, but I am talking about the series as a whole, so read at your own risk.\r\nStory - 10\r\nThis is what makes SnK so hugely compelling, at least for me. The world is wonderfully conceived and it shows \u2013 we're given extra information on eyecatches about the history of the walls, the functioning of weaponry, the breeding of horses, the layout of towns, and anything else that might ever interest the viewer on top of and reinforcing anything contained in the actual episode. These factoids do wonders to establish asense of place and of culture, to make the lands within the walls so much more real. Pains are taken to establish the antiquity of the walls and the history of the settlements within them. The three military groups that protect humanity are given more backstory than some of the characters, sometimes through little things like naming the main characters\u2019 graduating class \u201cthe 104th Trainees Squad\u201d or an exploratory mission \u201cthe 57th Expedition Beyond the Walls.\u201d This establishes a history and lineage that make for an engrossing viewing experience. Overall, the world of SnK is among the most fleshed-out worlds I've encountered in all of fiction, and it sucked me in effortlessly.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the actual story goes, suspense is certainly not hard to find, and in fact might be overused. I know others appreciate how fast-paced the show is, but I felt it to be a little too rapid, perhaps trying to cram too much story into its 25 episodes. The suspense is built quite well, with just enough foreshadowing to instill a mood (usually dread) in the viewer without beating him/her over the head with it (though the cliffhangers do get old after a while). Characters are brought in and out of the plot deftly, but only sometimes is the vast reserve of supporting characters juggled effectively (see below).\\n\\n\r\nThe setting and plot intersect perfectly in that the ultimate goal of the protagonists is to uncover the reason for the appearance and existence of the Titans, which drove humanity inside the walls and is the cause of all the other differences between their world and our own. That lofty goal often takes a back seat, however, to intervening events and restrictions -- some from outside the walls, some from within.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\nThis is the back of SnK's neck -- that is to say, its weak spot. As some other reviewers have pointed out, there is too much passage of time and too much bickering among characters for there not to be more development in them. In the moment, the characters are incredibly relatable, in that the Titans put intense fear in them, fear not only for their lives but also for their families, their hopes and dreams, and humanity itself. The development of the characters, however, leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nEren, nominally the main character, simply doesn't develop. He is known for his catchphrase \"I'm going to kill all the Titans,\" which he utters at least a dozen times over the course of the series, nearly evenly dispersed from the first episode to the last. His character blew me away for the first 6-8 episodes, but after that the unyielding and indomitable determination that makes him so compelling a character began to wear thin, and his approaching every situation (fighting Titans, recovering from wounds, eating soup) with the same reckless intensity borders on the absurd by the time the series ends. About 2/3 of the way through the series, there is even an episode in which we are initially led to believe he had changed and began to trust his peers and superiors, but later he throws that out the window and decides to just try and kill things instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters introduced with the Survey Corps don\u2019t really get backstories, and as such aren\u2019t very compelling. We are supposed to see Levi as reticent and mysterious when he is first introduced, when really the viewers are just left in the dark because of receiving absolutely no information about him. That's forced mystery, which is a poor substitute for the real thing. Similarly, Erwin is cast as noble and brave, but comes off as imperious, because he commands absolute obedience and we never quite know why. We know Hanji\u2019s research, but we have no idea how or why she ended up as the Corps\u2019 token scientist.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile there are two dozen other characters milling about, some of whose names you will forget until they get eaten or suddenly become relevant to the plot\u2019s progression. Notable in this category for me is Jean, who is boring, plain-looking, and forgettable even as he interacts with the main characters on a regular basis.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character that genuinely grows is Armin, who is paralyzed with fear at the beginning of the series but who gradually develops confidence in his own physical prowess and especially his tactical brilliance. In doing so, however, he becomes a character on par with seasoned military commanders, which strains credibility. Late in the series Armin has virtually no flaws, like Eren's other sidekick, Mikasa. So we are left with our core trio \u2013 one character who keeps giving in to his main character flaw, one who overcame his, and one who never had one. Real compelling.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are watching SnK to be entertained, the characters are perfectly serviceable. But if you are watching to have a little think along with your entertainment, they are kind of a letdown. The plot loves to play head games with the viewers, but the biggest trick it's playing on us is making us think these stock characters are worth biting our nails over.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI will leave better assessment of this to others, as I am of the \"if I don't notice it, then it's good\" school of art appreciation. It's a beautifully illustrated series, but I'm an uneducated buffoon who couldn't tell you why I think that. As I noted above, however, I think several of the minor characters don\u2019t look distinctive enough and are therefore difficult to remember. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also good, but I can't speak much to it. Both OPs are in-your-face and inspiring at the same time. The second is just good but the first one is outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nThis is a hugely entertaining series and probably my new personal favorite. I\u2019m willing to overlook my misgivings about character development until I see the second series that it seems certain we'll get fairly soon (and read the manga). I think this is the kind of show that\u2019s in it for the long haul, and I\u2019m hopeful that what I perceive as a lack of development is actually just really slow development. But character problems or no, the engaging world of SnK is well worth your attention and the roller-coaster story will keep it until the very end.\\n",

            "content": "\"Attack on Titan? Overrated!\" or \"Shingeki no Kyojin? More like crap!\" Do your friends say that? Mine do. Words can't describe how much I hate them for it. This anime is a masterpiece, and anyone who tells you otherwise either hasn't seen it or \"saw it\" but really wasn't paying attention. Now all I have to do is convince you to start.\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 10/10\r\nThe story is quite simple actually. Predators called the titans have exterminated the human race and the rest have moved behind walls in order to survive. The human protagonist is curious about what is outside the walls, and someday wishes to go there.One day, a colossal titan knocks down the wall and he realizes what a cruel reality is. So he joins the army to help exterminate these monsters. All is going well, or not well, because humanity is being pushed farther and farther into the walls. THEN THE PLOT TWIST HAPPENED. No spoilers, but if you were caught off guard like I was, you know what I mean. Then, just as you think everything is going to go well there is ANOTHER ONE! The story is epic and was fairly original at the time, but those plot twists brought it up to a 10.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the animation crisp and impressive, the drawing style is very bold and stands out compared to your average anime, on top of fitting the dark atmosphere. I have no complaints.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is outstanding, and it truly brings the characters to life. The music is literally flawless, besides unmemorable ending songs. The rest far outweighs that though.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the one spot where this anime isn't outstanding. I don't mean the characters themselves though, they have done nothing wrong. All unique and memorable...ish. Well kind of memorable. It's not their fault they were born bland. I mean, I get where you're coming from, and it definitely makes it more epic with out long pink hair everywhere. But the characters are stuck with 4, maybe 5 at maximum different hair colors, and they all have similar styles. Sure, you can tell them apart, but nothing makes them stand out, and you will probably only remember the three main characters and fan-favorite captain Levi.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's really too bad the characters weren't memorable, that's not something you can fix with season 2. However, I still eagerly await a sequel to this great show!",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin is the shows which constantly receives high end ratting not only on MAL, but all around internet and is almost constantly praised as one of the best anime ever (or at least, so far). \r\nSo, what is the best and most amazing thing about the show?\r\nDeath of the characters.\r\nEntire show basically runs of the initial shock factor built around psychical intimidation of the viewers by suggestive themes of gore, agony, despair and death. Most characters die horribly screaming and pissing their pants while being torn apart and eaten alive by giant monsters and show creators didn\u2019t spared any expense in filling theshow with this kind of scene to attract every kind of sadist weirdo anime community have to offer. Even though I cannot deny the fact they are very good in making suggestive scenes and psychically intimidating the viewer, but it\u2019s not enough to make a show good if only thing authors do is to revel in top-end gore. It may be realistic, considering the real history of human race filled with wars, but it certainly isn\u2019t entertaining or it shouldn't be.\\n\\n\r\nIn time, you stop to care about the death shows display as you are completely dulled just like the character they introduce late in the season. Suggestive scenes which shocked you first doesn\u2019t mean anything to you any more as you stop being influenced by all that bloody carnage authors throw you again and again. \\n\\n\\n\r\nApart of that, show doesn\u2019t have anything to offer. \\n\\n\r\nStory is nearly pointless. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have titans, giants, zombies or tentacle monsters from outer space, only important thing is they kill people and you are probably expected to enjoy it. Story and setting serves only purpose and that is killing character. \\n\r\nHow possible a medieval society built a walls higher than skyscrapers? Doesn\u2019t matter, giants break in and kill people. Only weapon society created is steampunk spiderman gear with retractable blades? How this suppose to be realistic or effective? Don\u2019t ask, most important thing is that things deliver characters to their early demise and you can enjoy their death in hands of ever hungry monsters. How come main characters are nearly immortal and superior fighters always out of the danger while lifespan of average fighter counts in split second? Not to mention that plot relevant question as origin of the titans or what is hidden in that basement are never answered as writers were obviously too busy to kill the side cast. \\n\r\nCharacter development? No, we will rather show you death of another random guy.\\n\r\nAnd if story really need to follow the [i]Everyone Dies[/i] scenario, why we have three main character who are nearly immortal or do take plot armor to the letter? \\n\r\nWell, because you need them around so story can show you \u2026 more side character deaths!\\n\\n\r\n After an initial shock and raising a lot of question, it forgets about everything and undergoes a very strange pacing when they skip entire weeks of years just to show you \u2026 another side character death, another suffering, another viewer intimidation. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, enjoyment of this story is near nil for a viewer who isn\u2019t latent sadistic psychopath who revel is seeing death at least in animated form.\\n\r\nStory and plot losts itself at cca episode 2. Drama is there, but build only on suffering. Nothing nice even happen. Characters either die or are plainly annoying\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nI went through the story to the end, hoping for either come conclusion or anwers which would give this massacre some meaning in the end, but it never came. While I must admit show had the potential in making me \u201cexpecting something\u201d I have to say I would be best if I\u2019d never watch the show. \\n",

            "content": "Every once in a while a show comes along that everyone is all gun ho on. This show is often not what everyone expects. After 15+ episodes the hype train turns sour. Then the bandwagon starts jumping. Then the show ends. It's MAL rankings have dropped significantly. The spoilers become jokes. Everyone puts it behind them as a mediocre series and all is forgotten. Usually I am able to avoid the hype train but on this one occasion I was approached by someone very close to me about this. \r\nAttack on Titan is a major letdown. The initial episode is great. Jaw dropping massacre andan immediate introduction to the cruelty of this world. This ladies and gentlemen is how you sell people on your show. The problem is that AoT refuses to let up on the gore. Episode after episode AoT is littered with brutal imagery simply for shock and awe. This doesn't go away until nearly the end of the series. Once its been established it doesn't need constant overselling. Far to much time is spent trying to sell the viewer on what they are watching rather then telling a story.\\n\\n\r\nEventually AoT does get moving on the story front until it jumps over years in a single episode. Time constraints do limit what anime can do compared to manga but considering the speed of the series later on the jump is unjustified. What stabilizes everything is something im going to call the first event. Something happens that completely changes the premise of the show. From this point on AoT is something that is theoretically worth watching. It may not be the most entirely unique thing out there but it's entirely watchable. The downside is AoT would much rather show images of people leaning against walls than actually doing things so it spends allot of time wasting time rather than working with their new premise.\\n\\n\r\nIt turns out there's a reason for that though. Despite the fact that the premise of the show has already changed once, AoT starts dropping the least subtle hints in the world of anime, that the Titans are not the real enemy. This is the worst part of AoT so far. There is no reason to go on a conspiracy train when you have a solid engaging premise right in front of you. It puts some serious dents in the show when what the show is supposed to be about is not what the show is doing at any point. Attack on Titan seems intent on, episode by episode, trying to introduce a new plot hook each time as though its viewers wont be back next week. None of this pays off in the end when AoT expects everyone to be surprised by the secret that everyone already knows.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really crushes Attack on Titan is the second event. To this point AoT has been a series crushes any hope at every opportunity. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. The one shining beacon that gives a sliver of hope is our hero. Then the second event happens. Immediately everyone is shocked by the reveal. Taking a step back however brings the logical implication that everything is over. At this point the show might as well kill every character in it, drop the mic, and go home. There is no recourse. Everything that happens after this is an arbitrary and pointless endeavor. Attack on Titan has no reason to continue save for becoming overly increasingly stupid.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately Attack on Titan is pointless. Hopefully it does not get a second season. Hopefully the money goes elsewhere. Hopefully someone learned something from this. Watch if your really bored. Don't be surprised if its not stisfactory\\n\\n\r\n-Docbrown - Otakucenter.com Reveiw Squad",

            "content": "Been a while since I'm addicted to an Anime but this been driving me crazy. Before taking this to my to watch list I was like, eww the cover is a huge dude with no skin on the giant wall, what so great about it? Then I just bypass this. But my freaking friend won't stop talking about it every time we hangout, and convince me to watch it and also to write a review about it.\r\nBefore we start this is my first review on MyAnimeList, and thanks for your time reading this.\r\nStory (9/10) : This is the kind of anime that you can't predictwhat next episode going to show next. The story already building since the 1st episode and wanting you to watch. Based on the faith on humanity, titans are locked outside of the city with the giant wall built few hundred years and suddenly they broke the wall and start rampage the town with lots of satisfactory bloody death scenes. This is just the 1st episode! Seriously, except for Gantz, which anime at the start have a massacre killing spree? \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) : The art is very solid. Overall environment is well drawn. The fighting and flying/jumping scene is just top notch. However, the hard outline on the character is just not my cup of tea. They should have easy on the outline, may be is just their style of drawing, but I feel lighter outline will be better. I think majority of the viewers are OK with this thou.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) : This is the best strong parts of this anime. First is the opening theme, is just epic! Well designed PV that doesn't show much of the story but still show the acting scene and some character introduction and weapon are hinting in the opening. Endings are great with a softer style. The soundtracks are just right on the spot, abuse of rock and electronic BGM is just fits into the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10) : Well developed from the beginning and slowly evolved to the main story. However, some character gets strong attention in the beginning but ended pretty early which is kind of waste as they have strong personality and good supporting role. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10) : It won't be my all time best anime, but it will fit on my top 10 Anime all time due to solid production and unique storyline. This anime has set a higher benchmark of the future anime with almost perfect in every aspect. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and I am sorry for my grammatical error since English is not my mother tongue. I have some experience in writing review on other anime site but that was long ago, and currently I'm having strong passion again in Anime. I'll be writing more review in the future, and please enjoy your anime!",

            "content": "I like that when I turn on MAL, I see all of this critical acclaim going to one particular series that has stirred up a lot of hype and praise for being bold and original, while also pushing the boundaries of what an anime could be. Some people decided to rate this one series a 10 because of the first 5 episodes, and how it shocked them to see how the main character supposedly dies in battle from the latest Titan attack. Others try to sugarcoat the hype it receives, claiming that. \"Well, it is the best series I've seen all season, so it defiantlydeserves all the acclaim.\" Well I hate to break to you guys, but this is by far one of the most mediocre and overrated anime series I have ever seen to hit the big screen, or in realistic terms, my computer.\\n\\n\r\nSo where to begin with this review? How about the first five episodes? That defiantly deserves some mention, considering how a lot of people point to those episodes as to reasons why it deserves the acclaim it has gotten. And, if I have to give credit where credit is due, the first 5 episodes were the best in the series. That however doesn't say much for the remaining episodes though. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea of a human race trying to survive the apocalypse by building walls to avoid superior beings is an interesting concept. It gives the audience a sense of danger and fear for the characters fighting to survive, as they are mostly inferior and ill-equipped to fight these Titans. We want to see them win these nearly impossible battles, by strategizing their attack and working together by building bonds and trust with one another.\\n\\n\r\nHowever things take a turn for the worse, starting off with episode 7, as the series brilliant pacing and engaging story starts to take a nose dive (episode 6 was more of a character-building moment for Mikasa, but I'll get into that later). My problem with episode 7 and most of the other episodes, is how slowly paced they  were and also how they were not ass engaging as the previous 5 episodes. It slows down, and doesn't advance much of story, as characters go through tedious monologues about how scared they are or the most recurring response, \"What are we going to do?\" How about you fight, instead of standing on a building for an entire 20 minutes contemplating your death!\\n\\n\r\n This can also be said about the mediocre standoff the main characters had with the Survey Corps, when the Corps were trying to decide if they were friends are foes. I found myself laughing at how long this took, while in real life, this situation would've been taken care of in 5 minutes, not 22. \\n\\n\r\nAlright, alright enough with these pacing issues because if I continue to talk about these issues for the other episodes, I could take all day, but I'm sure you all already get my point. Now to move on to the most annoying aspect of this series; the characters. \\n\\n\r\nI find it insulting that a series like this with the amazing production values it contains has the least interesting characters I have ever seen. Eren is clich\u00e9 and generic compared with other shonen characters in the past. His goal, which is clich\u00e9 itself, is to destroy all the evil in the world, which are the Titans. You may say that Eren has every reason to feel this way, since he saw how his mother was brutally murdered, but even this idea is overexaggerrated, especially in the next to last episode when it takes him yet another full episode to realize what he's fighting for. Btw, if he also wants to help save humanity, he shouldn't try to destroy an entire city in the process when fighting titans, killing innocent civilians. Of course there's that whole Titan transformation Eren goes through, but I'll get into that later.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Mikasa, the love interest to Eren. You may think I might like her more because she's, you know, smart compared to her other colleagues who are all idiots, and also because she has a very traumatizing past. However after episode 6, there's not much depth added to her character, excluding the idea that she's a really badass fighter who's good at chopping off the fingers of Titans. Her love for Eren is also overexaggerated as she seems to also make stupid decisions when defending him. Yes I know Eren helped save her in the past, but I wish the series had given her more than being a life-debt to Eren.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, there's Armin, the worst of the three. The reason I say that is not only because he's a whiny little brat, but also because  I can expect his character development from a mile away. He starts off whiny, scared and useless, then starts to work with others to defeat the oncoming evil, while also delivering clich\u00e9 speeches to stop the stupidity of the other members of the Survey Corps. I soon realized that Armin should've had a different role in the series, a strategist who helps plan the attack on the Titans while leaving it to the Survey Corps to fight. He should just stay the hell away from fighting because he is completely useless and is also a liability. Don't believe, just ask Eren, oh wait! The fact that he's even in the Survey Corps baffles me because he has no fighting ability at all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally to explain what really did the nail in the coffin for me; Eren's transformation into a Titan. Some people believe bigger is always better, but this is not necessarily the case. As I said before, I liked the idea of the human race having problems fighting the Titans and losing to them because they were inferior to them in size. This creates tension and a sense of danger for them, as you don't know what will happen next. When Eren transforms, all of that tension and danger is gone as he goes through a rampage killing each Titan one on one. It destroys everything that made the first 5 episodes so good, and burns its way though an entirely different path that is least interesting. It's like someone handing you the answers to a test before you take it. You don't have to worry about a thing, just follow along and everything should be ok. There is no longer any more excitement or engagement in the series. You expect the expected, and you're left feeling bored. \\n\\n\r\nYes this anime has great animation. Yes it has great music. Yet it's lacking substance and a reason to care for what goes on in the story.",

            "content": "Another show of the femenist agenda and japans' twisted view of the world. This is show about the huge naked men trying to eat all the people and the women who fight them. Also it has some stupid message about strong and weak people that makes no sense. Why do it make no sense? Let me tell you about this ridiculusly violent show.\r\nThe story is just what I said, bunch of naked giant and women acting like men. This is all it is, just humans fighting against naked guys. Lots of characters get eaten for dramatick effect. They force some message between strong and weaksurvivals in there, but it's really stupid when you truly think about it because by that logic they should just let the giants win, right? They just hungry, they just doing what they're supposed to! Maybe humans finally get what they deserve and Im supposed feel bad for them? Not much story here, the story is just bobsessed with killing everyone. Im serious, people get eaten, stabbed, shot, everything short of having a wild badger or angry phallus thrown at them can make people dead in here. Brutal and not for the faint of heart.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the character: remembur when anime had strong men in it? Not any more because now they're all weak and whiny while scrawny women are strong for no reason. Everyone in this show is either whiny or strong or a jerk. Everyone is violent and they just want to kill everything. There is nothing else except a potatoes girl who ruins the feel of every moment.\\n\\n\r\nArt looks good, but is mostly just drawn naked men because the feminist agenda is obssessed with rape and afraid. The author should look into therapy or read Frued because she's obviously suppressing something. Colors are great and animated well, though. These women know how to make things pretty.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also good, but adds stupid chanting to make things seem epic. The sounds for the giant angry men is also scary and almost makes me want to protest and get a support groop, too! Why can't we be equels all Im saying!?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're a woman who doesn't understand Frued and likes lots, and I mean lots of violence, you'll really love this show. If you're a man who likes to think sivilly and looks for good story you'll hate this show. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin (also known as Attack on Titan), is an outstanding anime with a very interesting story line and very likeable characters. My personal favorite bring Sasha Braus a.k.a. Potato Girl who is probably the funniest character in the show, if you've seen her you know why ;-) The manga is also really good too, so I'd definitely suggest that too.\r\nAttack on Titan takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where humans where driven to near extinction by a race of giant, hulking beings known as Titans. For some strange reason they exist for the sole purpose of devouring as many humans as they comeacross. They're nearly unstoppable for the only way to kill them is to cut through the nape located in the back of their neck which is nearly impossible for soldiers to get to. In order to reach this spot, the humans developed the 3D maneuver gear which allows the wearer to navigate quickly in a three-dimensional space. However, even with this technology the Titans are too overwhelming for the humans to fight so they decide to take refuge behind three giant walls (outer: Maria; middle: Rose; innermost; Sina) inaccessible to most Titans. This allows mankind to experience one-hundred years of peace. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Eren Jaegar, a young boy who aspires to one day travel outside the sanctity of the walls and explore the vast world located in the Titans territory. One day life for all man kind changes as we know it. A giant Titan measuring at about sixty meters smashes a giant hole in the wall, allowing access to smaller Titans who quickly storm in and devour every human in site. Eren along with other human survivors flee to Wall Rose for refuge. \\n\\n\r\nAfter losing his mother, Eren decides to join the military so that he can one day join the Recon Corps and take the fight to the Titans in their own land. His best friend Armin Arlert, and adoptive-sister Mikasa Ackerman also decide to join the military in hopes of turning the tide for man kind.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nEren Jaegar- After losing his mother, Eren decides to join the Recon Corps in favor of his own personal vendetta and also to explore the outside world. \\n\\n\r\nMikasa Ackerman- After losing her parents, Mikasa is taken in by Eren and his family and she and Eren develop a sibling like bond with one another. She graduate top in her class in the training corps and is a prodigy when it comes to fighting Titans, even surpassing elite soldiers.\\n\\n\r\nArmin Arlert- Him and Eren have been best friends since childhood. After losing his grandfather, Armin decides to join the military along with Eren and Mikasa. Armin doesn't possess the battle prowess of Mikasa or the sheer bravery and tenacity of Eren, but he makes up for this with his great intelligence. \\n\\n",

            "content": "this show is a pretty typical action show, but it does have its upsides.\r\nThe plot is essentially everything changed when the firenation attacked.  Be prepared for time skips that are pretty irrelevant and could have been summed up within a five minute prequel at the beginning of the first episode.  They seem to have taken manga to anime to heart in its entirety, and so pacing that worked well in the manga doesn't work as well in the anime and tends to drag it along.\r\nThe art is rather sub-par at some points and great at others.  Its a weird blend of 3danimation and 2d, but it tends to work nicely in most scenes.  However, when characters are standing there and the thick lines contrast against the nicely fine lined backgrounds, it tends to be a distraction.  The titans are probably what stands out the most as something really well developed in this anime.  They look grotesque, you don't want to look at them because they are so uncomfortable, and that's AOTs main saving grace.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mix of good and bland.  The main character is a typical naruto-type trope, dim witted and pretty useless until they've written themselves into a corner and then he's just the man you need.  His two best friends, sakura(armin) and sasuke(mikasa), are also pretty just as stereotypical.  A lot of characters they dont really develop and then end up having something awful happen to them a few episodes later, leaving the audience really confused with how they're supposed to feel.  Its like an action anime trying to become a drama and its doing so very clumsily.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is also rather interesting.  Minus the unnessecary time skips, you also have a lot of black and white in one episode.  Characters will gain courage, something happens, characters lose courage and everything is back to point a.  In an episode this will happen about two or three times, which is odd considering how short the episode lengths are.\\n\\n\r\nAnother small saving grace is the fact that what's going to happen in the end is pretty obscure.  You can't figure it out exactly just by watching the anime, even though im 90% sure its going to be the colossal titan appears again and then ~*~something really cool happens~*~ but because its so hard to guess, it makes watching somewhat worth it.",

            "content": "Around three months ago a friend suggested it to me , truth to be told I wasn't very intrigued by the sound of it . A bunch of people living inside some walls and getting eaten by enormous human-like creatures called Titans. All I saw was death and angst and wasn't up for it. I could never been more wrong . Once I started the series , there was no stop to it and so I managed to watch 22 episodes ( not all of them were aired at that point ) in only two days . But what makes it so good ? Surethere are a hundred animes with similar plot : a determined yet inexperienced protagonist going up against the bad guys ,knowing he has not chance against them.The will and determination gets him through the day along, of course, with his royal friends that make sure to keep the him/her in the right path . Sounds familiar ? \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to say that it's plot is the breakthrough in the history of the anime nor I'm going to disagree with those who say that Snk's plot is not that special. Yes , it's pretty simple . The human race is on the brink of extinction and lives under the constant fear of giant , human eating creatures called Titans . Eren ,the protagonist ,after his first encounter with them vows to kill every last of them and so the story begins . As you can see it's not much,but the way the story unfolds only raises you more questions than answering the ones that you already have.It makes you question every single thing that you took for granted since the begging. The motives and morals of the characters will only make wonder even more if the things you believed so far to be true are true indeed .Maybe there is a more complicated reason behind the things that happened ( not just Titans eating humans ) , maybe the true enemy is not the one that we think it is . What is the nature of the Titans ? They couldn't just simply exist out of nowhere, could they ? And let's not start about the basement....\\n\\n\r\nArt:(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful detailed scenery with just the right colours ,that's all I'm gonna say . One thing though that caught my attention is the art on each character . No one looks the same ,we have short characters with intimidate,sharp eyes,others with big,expressively eyes .You can actually tell from their features their origin , for example Annie( Russia ), Eren( Germany ),Mikasa (Japan ).I may be the only one to believe that, but it seemed worth mentioning .\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10 ): \\n\\n\r\n\"Sie sind das essen und wie sind die jaeger !\"I don't think this needed a better introduction,an epic opening song for an amazing anime .In fact both openings songs fit perfectly and their synchronisation with the openings are just amazing.Now, the rest of the soundtrack is just breathtaking and well made and the voice acting is quite fitting .It won't disappoint you.\\n\r\n.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that comes to my mind as to why Snk makes the difference is how realistic it is when it comes to the characters.While talking to a friend of mine about how underestimated the trio ( Eren , Mikasa , Armin ) is , she said something that can easily explain my point . \" The thing with Armin is..I really know how he feels \"  That's it ! Simple as that ! All the characters in this show are humans above all , no one is super strong or invincible. They cry , they live in constant fear even though they don't show it right away.They hate death and how they've been forced to live.They get injured and it takes actual time for them to recover. Even the strong ones die and their deaths are made in a way to show  that no matter who you are or what you've been through you die like everyone else .The deaths in this anime are so quick and uneventful that you start to wonder if it actually happened , because lets face it \" There is no way he/she would have died like that .It would have taken more to kill her/him \" No ! everyone is human and die just as easily.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nAt first ,most the characters would seem like the typical anime characters. Specifically referring to the main protagonist of the story Eren Jaeger.At first he seem to be the cliche anime character who lost his family and vows to get revenge on whoever did it, something that have been used so many times before that got old already .I don't completely disagree with that opinion, but as the story unfolds I can assure you that his character is far more interesting that you originally thought. This goes for the most of the characters in the story who appears to be one sided and typical at first but  more complex and unique later on , including the characters that seem to be \"bad guys \" in the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nSomething refreshing about Snk are the battles .I haven't watch that many anime in my life , but one thing that couldn't escape my attention was the pattern that most them seem to follow  Let's give an example : the anime character (possibly the protagonist) faces an enemy believing deep in his heart that he is going win .Later on releases that it's almost impossible to do so, as the enemy is too strong for him , but doesn't give up for the sake of his friend , family, loved one etc. At the crucial moment when he/she is about to lose/die something magically happens (possibly a flashback or someone shows up ) and the character suddenly rises up and defeats the enemy while saying some interesting things about the power of will or friendship or love . I'm not saying that this pattern can't be found in Snk , but it's nice to see that not many of the battles scenes are like that .Most of the battles in this anime raises many questions about humanity and moral ambiguity and it reminds you the condition in which those people live : fear and war . There is death everywhere and it's not something that you can oversee for that sake of the living .Of course the protagonist survives along with the few characters that we are familiar with,but it's not at any rate a victory .\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love the most in this anime is the intensity that some scenes hold .The animation , voice acting and soundtrack are combined in such way that will leave you completely amazed and could easily bring tears in your eyes.I'm sure those who have already seen the anime will understand to which scenes I'm referring to and surely Mikasa's voice saying \" My life has no meaning anymore . What's keeping me going ? \" following by Eren's voice \"Fight ! \" will surely have crossed your mind.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10 )If you haven't seen Attack on Titan I suggest to go watch it!",

            "content": "So this is kinda my first public review. \r\nAs it is evident that this title is filled with most of the flaws, I am crossing over to it immediately. \r\n-The biggest drawback of this series are the characters, none of them actually has quality, I have no desire to worry or connect with these characters in any way.\r\nWhat writers usually do is create a protagonist and make the audience worry about that person, so when we find that character is in some trouble, we can actually take care of him and what is going to happen to him, and this is not the case inthis anime.\\n\r\n-The next drawback, which is also extremely large, is pacing. \\n\r\nToo Much Talk, Too Little Action, one of the many examples is when Eren finds that he can turn into Titan. Commander Pyxis gives him the goal that one of the holes made by the armored titanium clog with a stone, believing or not it takes 3 fucking episodes to do it. \\n\r\nSuch pacing is the result of an animator/editor making these scenes feel longer than they actually are.\\n\r\nMany take in defense that this is his first work, and from that side they want to make it easier for some critics. However, just because he is an amateur, that does not mean that we can not show obvious mistakes, and Hajime Isayama makes pretty bad decisions about writing during this series.\\n\r\nAttack on Titan is a show that had the potential,but  having a good story does not bring you automatically to the highest score, you need to earn it. \\n\\n\r\nApart from all the bad things mentioned, as a plus there is concept, action and animation, theme as well as music.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, Attack on Titan is an extremely overrated anime, although it's actually a piece of garbage, it's not the worst anime I've seen, but it's sad to see how people call this the best anime and how much praise it actually gets. \\n",

            "content": "What do you get when you combine the following and have it licensed by none other than Funimation Entertainment?\r\n- A concept that allows for battles of epic proportions to go down\r\n- Absolutely gorgeous art direction\r\n- Flawless animation done by none other than a company like Madhouse, Bones, or Production I.G\r\n- An enthralling soundtrack that never ceases to get the blood pumping while also sending chills down your spine when the moment calls for it\r\n- An English dub with great actors such as J. Michael Tatum, Mike McFarland, and Matthew Mercer on-board\r\nOrdinarily, you'd have something that would have me squealing like a pig in excitement (i.e.FMA Brotherhood, Hellsing Ultimate, Stand Alone Complex). Unfortunately, horrendous pacing and an extremely unlikeable lead character (along with some other problems) ruin what ultimately could've been an extremely enjoyable experience. Would I say that it's the greatest anime ever? Hell to the fucking no. Would I say it's trash? I know I've said it in the past when I was a hypercritical little shit starting out on MAL. Of course, now I would say that it's fair enough. There was some good, a lot of bad, and a lot of frustration to be had but in comparison to some of the other crap that exists, Attack on Titan isn't deserving of anyone's visceral hatred.\\n\\n\r\nBut before I get into this review, a question: why do people like post-apocalyptic programmes so much? While everyone's reasons can and inevitably will differ, the reason why I like post-apocalypse as a genre boils down to one thing: survival. Think about it: you have something like a cataclysmic nuclear war go down, what's the end result? The world as we know it is down for the count and humanity is no longer at the top of the food chain. The thrill that I get from watching a post-apocalyptic show or playing a post-apocalyptic video game comes from watching someone make it through this new wasteland, never knowing what's going to go down next.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this leads to quite a few problems on my end. The biggest problem that I have with post-apocalyptic shows is the fact that all too often, they try to build up the suspense but they spend too much time talking and then the show quickly becomes tedious rather than enthralling. I don't know about you, but I don't really find the idea of a bunch of people huddled around in cramped quarters repeating the same shit we heard over and over again exciting. If I go into a zombie flick, I want to see some fucking zombies getting their heads blown off.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter which way you look at it, Attack on Titan is pretty much a medieval zombie apocalypse, just replace the zombies with man-eating giants. Of course, I knew that from the very beginning but I was willing to overlook since the trailers and shit that I saw on YouTube made this show look like something that is a definite \"must-watch\" and this shit's on Netflix, so I pretty much have no excuse. So when I actually got around to watching the pilot episode of Attack on Titan, I've got to say that Wit Studio and Production I.G REALLY had the set-up perfect. \\n\\n\r\nWe start out with an image of a titan peering over the wall, the music is all intense and lively, and then it cuts to some dudes on horseback that are about to kill a titan which perfectly transitions into the first opening sequence of the show. Do I really need to go any further with the show's first opening? I swear, it's something that NEVER ceases to get me pumped for some mind-numbingly awesome action sequences. Fucking hell, it's no wonder this show is so popular.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the good stops there and doesn't come back until the last 5 minutes of the episode because absolutely nothing of substance happens. Yes, you heard me right: for a good 15 minutes of the first episode, nothing of substance happens. How could this possibly be so? Well... Attack on Titan was adapted from what is primarily an ongoing battle shonen manga which is probably its biggest flaw. When you get right down to it, action mangas tend to blow through a LOT of pages that are spent depicting large-scale battles in every chapter with little to no dialogue (ref: Gantz).\\n\\n\r\nAdapting an ongoing battle shonen manga is a difficult endeavour because you always run the risk of padding and of course, much-maligned filler episodes. Wit Studio and Production I.G mostly side-stepped the filler episode problem by limiting themselves to adapting the first eight volumes of the manga. Unfortunately, the time that was allotted for Attack on Titan was far too large for the material it was trying to adapt and as such, it ends up resorting to padding so that it can fill out the episode length. Guess how Attack on Titan likes to fill out its episode length.\\n\\n\r\nDoes Attack on Titan further elaborate on concepts brought up in the manga? Does it give screen time to characters that were underdeveloped? Will it allow us to see certain characters in a different light than the way they were portrayed in the source material? Hell to the fucking no. Attack on Titan offers nothing in the way of adaptation expansion and instead relies heavily on repeating the same shit that we've heard over and over again. This is the same trap that programmes such as The Walking Dead have been falling into for years, constantly trying to build up suspense but failing to do so in the process.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the pacing in Attack on Titan is absolutely atrocious, almost to Michael Bay levels. Some moments progress ridiculously fast while other moments slow down to a grinding halt. There's absolutely no consistency whatsoever. Just to put things into perspective, the two biggest arcs in the series (Attack on Trost and Expedition 57) are 9 and 6 episodes respectively. I honestly don't give a shit about what you say but the amount of time spent for the result that we got was far too much, especially given how much was adapted from the manga. What's so bad about a 1-cour season, anyway?\\n\\n\r\nThat's only the tip of the iceberg. I could go on for hours about all the faults that SNK has with its story but that would be too much work on my end (especially for something that's probably going to be mass-downvoted anyway by butthurt fanboys). I do understand why people keep giving Attack on Titan shit for not going further with the concepts and shit that it brings up, but let's be real here: this is an adaptation of the first eight volumes of a battle shonen manga. World building wasn't really on the cards to begin with, especially if we're this early in its run (it DOES publish on a monthly basis, after all).\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure that in due time, all will be revealed to us. Attack on Titan's manga sales have topped One Piece's in Japan and it's been like that for a while (if I'm not mistaken). It's inevitable for there to be more adaptations of Attack on Titan in the coming years. There IS a second season announced along with two recap movies. Provided that the aforementioned three are big enough hits in Japan and the manga remains a bestseller, there's bound to be an adaptation in the works that will hopefully explain all this stuff (assuming that the second season doesn't do crap in that regard).\\n\\n\r\nI can definitely understand the praise that people give this show for its story since it is a fairly intriguing concept with less-than-stellar but still relatively enjoyable execution, but I CANNOT say the same about the characters. When people tell me that Attack on Titan has some of the best characters in all of anime, I just want to know what kind of mind-altering drugs they're on. Don't get me wrong, Attack on Titan's characters aren't horrible. Rather, it's just one bad apple that REALLY spoils the bunch. I'm of course talking about Eren fucking Jaeger.\\n\\n\r\nI can forgive the fact that the military enlists teenagers in their ranks, given the circumstances that humanity has been placed in. I can forgive that a lot of the secondary and tertiary characters are more or less forgettable since they're just going to be eaten anyway so why bother developing them? What I CAN'T forgive is the fact that despite all the circumstances that Eren is given, I cannot find the smallest modicum of sympathy for him (or even one redeeming trait). Eren is your typical, hot-headed battle shonen protagonist in the worst possible ways.\\n\\n\r\nLet me make one thing clear: I don't have much of a problem with hot-headed lead characters in shows I watch or manga that I read. In fact, they occasionally have a certain charm to them (ref: Inuyasha and Kyo Sohma). This is because I can find something redeemable about them. In Inuyasha's case, he's an obvious male tsundere who cares about his friends and can hold his own weight in battle. In Kyo Sohma's case, he's also an obvious male tsundere who cares about his friends/family that I find incredibly empathetic to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nI have absolutely nothing of the sort to say about Eren. He's one of those loud-mouthed and hot-headed battle shonen protagonists that's all bark and next-to-no bite. He's also one of those protagonists that just does not know when to shut up (and it doesn't help that his voice in both the Japanese AND English dub is extremely grating). Any time I see him on screen, I'm begging whatever God there is to just make him either shut up or get smacked around some by Levi (the courtroom episode is my favourite since Levi brutally beat up Eren and I found it RIDICULOUSLY satisfying).\\n\\n\r\nI also don't like how his goal is so vague to the point where all he really wants to do is \"kill all titans.\" I don't know about you, but I'm REALLY sick of characters who have ridiculously large goals/ambitions like becoming the very best, like no one ever was. It also doesn't help that he becomes some kind of pseudo-Messiah because of some \"hidden power\" people found out he had toward the middle half of the show (around the Attack on Trost and Expedition 57 arcs, coincidentally enough). Do I even need to explain why this is bullshit? Seriously, do I?\\n\\n\r\nJean, one of the few secondary characters whom I've grown to like would've been an infinitely better protagonist and could've given a much needed sense of realism that the show desperately needs. Rather than some ambiguously vague goal like killing all titans, his goal was initially about self-preservation but over time, he's come to change his views and has proven himself to be a capable tactician. The same can be said about Armin, but he starts out as a spineless coward who wants to prove his own worth. Unfortunately... he's one of the characters who repeats a lot of the same shit everyone else says thanks to all the constant padding that this show suffers from, but I attribute that to the source material more than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings me over to Mikasa. A lot of people say that she could've been a much more competent lead role, but I'm not too sure. Mikasa for one thing is a combat prodigy who's emotionally dependent on our little Scrappy-Doo of a protagonist. While she certainly is entertaining, any character development she could've had over the course of the series is instantly hindered by her overdependence on Eren. Yes, her backstory was certainly shocking and got me to see her in a relatively new light. Unfortunately, her overdependence on Eren pretty much leaves her stuck as this Mary Sue/possible yandere-type character. If you were to remove those two aspects about her character and kept everything the same, she could easily be written out of the story and not much would change. Hell, shit would actually be a lot better now that I think about it since she won't be around to bail Eren's ass out of stupid situations. But I digress, for it's now time to move over to the production values.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Wit Studio is a relative newcomer to animation, it should be noted that a good portion of their staff came from Production I.G, and I.G themselves co-produced this series. Can you really go wrong with a company whose resume consists of visual masterpieces like the entire Ghost in the Shell franchise and Guilty Crown? Even if you don't like the story or the characters, there's no denying that it's a real treat for the eyes. The medieval setting his handled beautifully, the action sequences are flawlessly animated and nothing short of entertaining, and what's more is that it has this relatively unique art style where the colour palatte adds an orange hue to almost everything and  all the characters, titans, and such are drawn with thick outlines. Some might not like it, but I certainly do. \\n\\n\r\nIf I really had to lodge one complaint with the art/animation, it's with the designs of the eponymous titans themselves. Unlike a select few titans (i.e. the Colossus Titan, the Armoured Titan), almost all the titans in this show are basically naked humanoids with really bizarre facial expressions. Am I supposed to find this shit terrifying? Yeah... no. I'd love to say that they look retarded, but that's an awful way to describe them. Let's just say that unlike the creatures from Gantz, Berserk, or Parasyte: The Maxim, the titans in Attack on Titan are NEVER going to haunt my nightmares. I really hope that there are more titans introduced with unique designs in the coming chapters and second season, since the Colossus Titan and Armoured Titan look REALLY good.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, the OST was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano whose resume consists of programmes such as Aldnoah.Zero, Blue Exorcist, Guilty Crown, and Gundam Unicorn. Say what you will about the shows he's worked on, but I can safely say that this man knows how to compose an enthralling soundtrack. If you want any examples, look no further than the iconic first opening theme song, \"Guren no Yumiya\" by Linked Horizon. It sets the stage perfectly, and while the actual substance of the show varies drastically from what this opening leads you to believe, it never ceases to get my blood pumping and make me anticipate what will go down next. I have just as much praise for the rest of the OST, so no complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there has to be that one glaring flaw which mars something that could've ultimately been flawless and that is Eren Jaeger, specifically his voice actors. Eren is an annoying character so I can't hold too much against the VAs who portrayed him, but my GOD do their voices give me migraines whenever I have to hear them (specifically, whenever Eren is shouting). It's especially worse in the English dub, since Bryce Papenbrook (who is a decent actor by the way) CANNOT shout for shit without making me wish I had ear plugs. The rest of the English dub is surprisingly well-cast and acted, but it's just that one little detail that makes beg whatever forces exist in this universe to end my suffering.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, Attack on Titan is a mixed bag. I was able to get some decent entertainment value from all the action sequences and the concept was handled well enough for me to not get bored for too long of a stretch of time. Unfortunately, the flaws that Attack on Titan has are far too great to ignore and yet somehow, the diehard fans defend this show to their graves as a masterpiece and the \"critics\" tear this show apart as worthless garbage that should never see the light of day. I honestly don't reciprocate either of those feelings. At its core, Attack on Titan is simply a dark battle shonen series that takes itself a little too seriously but at least it does some stuff right. Hopefully, things will get better in due time, but this first instalment of the franchise is a less-than-ceremonious start.",

            "content": "Attack on Titan wasn't an experience that made me violently ill, but after feeling like I'd been a victim of a bait and switch conspiracy I was less than pleased. \r\nOur story begins with a BOOOOOOOOOM, suspense! A monstrous creature suddenly appears to attack -human city- as civilians look on helplessly. Cut to a group of men, fleeing a very giant, very  naked, and very sexless human-like thing. Utilizing their \"maneuver gear\"  an apparatus that contains many hooks and winches that works like the Steampunk jet-pack you wished you thought up,they prepare to do battle...\r\n   Then the plot gets underway. Weare introduced to a young boy named Erin (Eren...?) Yeager, and his adopted sister, Mikasa. They live inside the outermost wall of the great human city, built to protect the population. Along with his friend, Armen, Eren aspires to greater things and the thrill of adventure outside his boring life. The appearance of aforementioned monster leads to a fatal attack on the outermost wall, and Eren's  fate will be forever changed.\\n\\n\r\nNot nearly as neat as I usually like a BRIEF summary, but if you ever pictured humans battling giants with little more than pluck and a slim chance you will be treated to an awesome viewing experience....for awhile.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the season goes over Eren's transformation from a boy to a young-adult/man. This is enjoyable to watch, and is nice and straightforward. And then the story forgets that, though audiences may not catch every single detail in  every moment of an episode, they still need a recap that has to last what feels like a sizable chunk of an episode. Coupled with the \"philosophy\" that it smacks you in the face with, and tortuously predicable elements that are unnecessarily drawn out,  the story quickly peters out. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are great! It's not a kiddie-friendly show by any means, and oh boy do I like to see some well-animated gore and viscera. Too bad they can't shut up half the time and just le-\\n\\n\r\nAudio is also above average. Catchy opening, suitably grim tracks coupled with lots of military-esque fanfare. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters....\\n\r\nNot necessarily \"stock\" but the show seems to switch gears between the genuinely unique and interesting persons to the less-so far too often. I didn't feel like much of the characterizing of red shirt's really helped the atmosphere of feel, and without divulging, you end up with a lot of time that ends up equaling head-scratching \"what?\" afterwards. The Team Four Star parody is gut-wrenching funny after you've seen the first three episodes; THAT I recommend at a 100/10. \\n\\n\r\nDid I like watching it? For a little while, yes. The fun in the series is action scenes. The combat is tense and gripping, but arrayed as to keep you aware of whats going on all around. Where the series falters is where it tries to dress itself up to be more than brutally violent. After hearing the same exposition over and over and over again, I was disenfranchised and bored. Season Two to the rescue perhaps....? Only time will tell.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt cheated by instant gratification for Godzilla-like antics with a little more at stake. At first I felt the series played it straight and was thus open to jokes at it's expense, but it delivered on the action so i was content. When I had to listen to the soapbox dialogue I felt cheated, and only compelled to keep watching in the hope that I'd get some over-the-top antics next. \\n\\n\r\nWatch it to see what you think, but It'll take a colossal promise of quality to get this reviewer back in the mood for more Attack on Titan. \\n\r\n-Lame Pun Ending",

            "content": "To say that Attack on Titan (or Shingeki no Kyoujin) is the most popular anime of 2013 is an understatement. The hype and popularity surrounding the show is much like its iconic Colossal Titan, a massive juggernaut towering over all the other anime that came out this year. And not without good reason, few shows can match Titan for sheer adrenaline fueled gut-wrenching entertainment. It is a hard-knuckled actioner that doesn't hold back any punches, as it beats the audience into a state of shock and awe. The show is bolstered by its grandiose bravado, massive scale, ruthless twists, and broadappeal. It is not wonder it grew to such great popularity instantly. However, that does bring up the eternal question: does the show live up to all the hype?\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan is a show so popular that its plot hardly needs to be summarized. The premise of mankind being forced into hiding by a monstrous and mysterious foe that threatens its extinction is hardly an original, but it is a tried-and-true one which instantly hooks the viewers' attention. Attack on Titan uses this premise as the foundation for a harsh and merciless yet endlessly interesting world with a lot to explore.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is fantastical, with unbelievably humongous walls which encompass the surprisingly vast human territory, which is divided into 3 sections. Despite this grandeur, the world feels grounded by a sociological edge. Humanity has grown use to being confined within the protection of the walls; complacent and afraid to venture outside to reclaim the world they had lost to the monstrous titans. Even within the walls, there is a pecking order, with the richer and more privileged having the protection of the inner walls, Rose and Sina, while the less fortunate only have the protection of the outermost Wall Maria. This, of course, has disastrous consequences when the walls are breached. The world is so expansive that the eye-catches before and after commercial breaks feature snippets of information that couldn't be worked into the main narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with these grand settings comes a humongous cast of characters; which largely works to the show's benefit, though not completely. Having such a large cast of characters establishes just how tremendous the struggle for humanity's survival is. Seeing so many named characters in risk and at the mercy of powers greater than themselves, the fact that the survival of the human race is at stake really hits home. It also illustrates how small these characters are in the face of this conflict. Characters die regularly, their lives often being snuffed out in inglorious desperation. The dead are grieved by those close to them, and treated with indifference by the bruised masses, who are too busy dealing with their own pain and loss. This disheartening depiction of battle and death is in stark opposition of the idealistic heroism depicted in most shows aimed at the shounen demographic, making it strikingly unique. Of course, the downside is that a lot of characters get barely any development. For as many characters as there are, very little of them are actually have a prominent role; most just feel like background (albeit sometimes quirky distinctive background) or body fodder for the titans to munch on. The sheer volume of characters makes it difficult for in-depth characterization for much of the cast, which is a shame because there is some potentially great characters that just don't get enough screen time. Still, the way the show uses its high body count to accentuate the desperation and tragedy mankind faces makes it hard to complain.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Eren, of course gets the most screen time and focus. In many respects, he's a typical shounen lead; driven, idealistic, and quick to fight. Personality-wise, he can come of as somewhat monotone in his single-minded goal of killing titans, but it's justified given the tragedy he suffered at the hands of the monsters. He can at times be overshadowed by the more colorful personalities in the show, but his anger and determination make him a logical center for the series. His burning desire to destroy the titans and overcome the complacency mankind has fallen into is at the heart of Attack on Titan, and becomes a particularly potent focal point when Eren develops a power that makes him both a subject of persecution and mankind's best chance of survival.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two most prominent characters are Eren's childhood friend Armin, and adoptive sister Mikasa. Of the three of them, Armin is the wimpy kid, but also the smartest. Unlike fiery Eren or stoic Mikasa, Armin is lacks confidence at the beginning of the show and is convinced he is a liability, being physically weaker than most of the other characters. As the series continues, situations arise in which his strategic and negotiation skills become vital, and Armin becomes more confident in himself. It's a tried-and-true method of development, and it works well here.\\n\\n\r\nMikasa is the strongest warrior of the three, and arguably of the entire show. More importantly, though, is her fiercely protective nature, especially where Eren is concerned. Being as strong as she is, Mikasa puts the weight of her comrades squarely on her shoulders, and has a strong sense of justice. Despite this, she is more pragmatic that Eren in her values, which coupled with her over-protectiveness causes them to clash. Her almost maternal instincts and some more intimate moments make her distinctly feminine, something that fiction (all fiction, not just anime) often struggles with. Some jaded viewers might see her attachment to Eren as the overused 'brother complex', and there is certainly more than a little ground for such accusations, but they're likely brought on by overexposure of the trope through anime more than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these things give weight and substance to the show, but what really makes Attack on Titan an entertaining watch is its unstoppable momentum. Yes, there are some pacing issues; arcs stretch out for episodes and episodes in a series that only has 25. Yet every episode leaves an insatiable desire to see what will happen next. Director Tetsurou Araki has all but mastered the art of keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. The show truly feels epic with its crushing bombast, fantastic action sequences, and Araki's signature booming direction. The show is hardly subtle in its heated confrontations and moments of overwhelming despair, but it really doesn't need to be. This is a show of great stakes and big emotions; the kind of show overblown dramatics were made for.\\n\\n\r\nProduction-wise, Attack is really quite impressive. Wit Studio, a subsidiary of Production I.G., does some great work bringing the vast world to life. The walls that enveloping the human realm are enormous, imposing structures. The over-crowded stone cities, military grounds, and long stretches of rural areas are well detailed; each having their own distinct atmosphere. Character designs are strikingly different from most anime, with sharp facial features and a European ethnic flavor, with Mikasa being the only character of Asian descent. The titans essentially are giant naked naked people, but genuinely are grotesque and intimidating. There are times their faces can look silly, though (i.e. the infamous moe-face titan) The few special titans look particularly nasty with their fleshy, skinless appearances. There are moments of obvious budget restraints and even a few sequences that are glorified slide-shows, but they are easily forgiven by the mind-blowing, movie quality action sequences. The music is equally as impressive: well composed, bombastic, and entirely fitting for the show.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to answer the question from the beginning of this review: yes, Attack on Titan does live up to the hype. Granted, it isn't exactly a flawless masterpiece; it certainly has a few rough spots, including a very open ending. However, it wholly delivers on the promise of being an incredibly entertaining post-apocalyptic bloodbath of epic proportions. Furthermore, it has more than enough substance and emotional girth to elevate it well above the normal bloodbath. This is a great example of what this kind of show can be; a courageous struggle in the face of insurmountable odds.",

            "content": "Okay, here we go. This might not go well for me.\r\nI was honestly very disappointed in this series. The trailers had me so excited, and the brutal concept was something that I was really looking forward to. Then the first episode aired. It was perfect. Dark, dreary, violent, and opened up so many questions and possible outcomes for our 3 young heroes. I couldn't wait to continue.\r\nHowever, that was where the enjoyment started to take a swift decline. Each plot twist added was, in my opinion, more ridiculous than the last and that took any and all seriousness away from the story that it couldhave possibly had. I liked each character less and less as time went on, and it eventually got to a point where it became impossible for me to finish.\\n\\n\r\nThere must be a reason why it is so highly praised. Maybe I'll give it another chance in the future, but as of right now, it's not what I'm looking for.",

            "content": "This will remain one of my favourite animes of all time. I don't care for those people who say that this anime is 'too mainstream to watch' or 'this anime is really overrated', because you know what? Shingeki no Kyojin is mainstream for a reason. It is flipping fantastic, and here's why.\r\nStory: 10\r\n*This is based solely on the anime, not the manga*\r\nFirst episode: Perfect. From then on, it just got better and better.\r\nThe story is is so well done. It is unique, it's horrifying when it needs to be, it's tragic at all the right moments, it's intense, and it's not even over dramatised, becausewho the hell wouldn't be crapping their pants if their entire world was under attack by flesh eating giants? \\n\r\nI absolutely loved how scared this anime made me feel. Enjoyment-wise, I think I liked the first half better (second half is still great). It was humanity against the Titans. Even though it was hopeless and impossible, it made me hold onto that tiny bit of hope they had. \\n\r\nThere isn't anything I have to complain about, because I see no flaw here. The only concern for this anime is their new upcoming season. If this is based closely to the manga I might have to change my score to a 9... I don't really like the path they headed down :(\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nWow wow wow. This style was something new to look at. Attack on Titan didn't follow the typical anime art style, that's for sure. For some reason, a lot of the characters actually somewhat look westernised. I mean, you can clearly see their noses, and strong line art. For some, this may not be their cup of tea, but for me personally, I didn't mind this. (Maybe with the thicker lines I did), but honestly, there was more to this anime than just its appearance.  Now, as for the action scenes: Amazing. When I first watched this, I was so very impressed. It was fluent and really really well executed. I wish I had 3D gear.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI think we all know, and no-one can deny, how great this soundtrack is. Even if you hate Attack on Titan (boo why?), you cannot deny it's amazing soundtrack. It's catchy and it's good. I have the entire soundtrack on my phone, and it's OP is basically my alarm in the morning. It makes me think I can conquer the world or something.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAll the characters have substance. Even the ones who are not main even seem too. They are all frightened, and fear controls them. Gosh, it feels so realistic at times.\\n\r\nThe character's loss of faith or fear, created in such an intense atmosphere. You never knew who was going to die, which always kept me on the edge of my seat. In this anime, I felt as though no character was safe.\\n\r\nEren is probably the most determined blood thirsty protagonist I have ever watched. I love it/he's a bit too crazy. This boy needs to calm down. I'm just waiting for the moment when he realises that perhaps Titan's aren't the real monsters, that really it's just people.\\n\r\nMikasa perhaps isn't really the 'strongest' character, as to be honest, we have all seen characters similar to her before, but nevertheless, she has a good backstory explaining the way she is.\\n\r\nAs for Armin and Jean... SUCH CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. A+ in that department. Not only that, but as I said before, this anime illustrates everything really realistically, and their change in character just makes so much sense. It's actually so believable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5\\n\r\nWhat I would say that this anime lacks is humour. Sounds weird because this anime is meant to be a real serious one anyway, but at times, I wouldn't mind seeing them find some happiness in the darkness. We all know that it is depressing, constantly living in fear, but the only sense of humour we receive is from Hanji. This of course is just me being picky, because honestly, I accept that there is probably nothing funny about Titans.\\n\r\nAnyway... As I have constantly been praising, just know that THIS ANIME IS BRILLIANT. Unless you really hate blood and gore stuff, or only like light-hearted animes, maybe this isn't the best choice. Honestly though, I don't think I have met a person who has actually straight up said to me that they DO NOT like Shingeki no Kyojin 100%. \\n\r\nWhen people say 'it's overrated'. I see the cons too, but this doesn't take away from the entirety of the anime. \\n\r\nAlso, don't not watch it just because it's 'too mainstream', because... Really?",

            "content": "First of all, been on MyAnimeList for a while now but never bothered making an account. This anime finally convinced me to. Minor spoilers...\r\nPS: This is coming from the perspective of someone who hasn't read the manga.\r\nShingeki no Kyojin was hyped for a while, but it was still met with the skeptical question of, \"Will this really live up to all the hype?\" In my case, it's exceeded my expectations. The first episode took off with a blast. The plot and setting were very simple -> We are the last remnants of humanity and there are tons of man-eating killing machines outside of these walls.Eren is your typical stubborn, headstrong, yet at the same time admirable protagonist, so he didn't seem very out of the ordinary. Mikasa, on the other hand, is a complete badass. She is cool, collected, and isn't made as an outlet for tons of fan service. In fact so far, this show has received spectacular ratings without ANY FAN SERVICE AT ALL which is very impressive. Anyway, the first episode introduced a lot of the story in a short amount of time including: the central conflict, reason to hate/fear the Titans (Eren's mother being killed), foreshadowing (primarily the mystery of Eren's father), and not being afraid to go completely out of the ordinary (taking down two walls in one episode!). \\n\\n\r\nThe other episodes built up adequately, going through training, backstory, more characters introduced etc. and then skipping to when Eren and the crew are about to graduate from their military training as the top of the class. The fast-paced buildup was great, leaving no room for fillers, and everything exploded again in episode 5. By the time episode 5 came around, I was completely hooked. I, like everyone else, usually skip anime openings after watching once or twice just because it gets tedious, but I've seen the opening to this anime every single new episode that came out because A) it has a great soundtrack and B) it hypes me up lol. But yeah, episode 5 gave the audience a sense of, \"Eren and these guys are going to completely kick some Titan ass and shit's gonna go down.\" To be honest, I was completely expecting him to. Then out of nowhere, like in episode 1, AGAIN the enemies seem impossible to beat. When Eren rushed into that Grandpa Titan's mouth to save useless Armin, I didn't feel like he was actually in any danger despite losing a leg and w/e just because the protagonist always winning has become the accepted norm. But NOPE!@%! When Grandpa closed his mouth it was gg. That was by far the best anime moment of 2013, probably even 2012 just because it felt so unexpected. Props to the original creator for not being afraid to be different and step out of the bubble. At the same time, I was worried for how the series would progress from such a dramatic change but some people who have read the manga told me they either loved the progression or hated it so we'll see...\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6 was just a Mikasa flashback that had that awesome \"Get baited noob\" moment but it was mostly just more explanation, nothing really crazy... still decent for a flashback. So far, this series has had a FANTASTIC introduction because it is so unorthodox, out of the norm but can pull it off, gorey-but-not-excessive, and brim-packed with action. Of course, a great intro doesn't mean it can't suddenly dropoff at any time *cough* SAO *cough*, but it certainly has the potential to be the best of 2013, maybe even compete in all-times. I'm going to not read the manga just to experience the full effect of the series, and I would encourage others to do the same for those who haven't already. I'm looking forward to it's success~\\n\\n",

            "content": "Possibly giant sized spoils below:\r\nThis is going to be similar to my shits about Monster, in that there are a lot of things I like and can praise about this show, but it has a few big problems with it that I think take the title of greatness away from it for me. Most of my review will be focusing on those negatives and I won't be doing a play by play on it or talking about the show at great length so much as I'll be talking about a general problem with it that drags it down a bit as a whole. A lotof what I don't like about this show is things that aren't actually in it but will be in it if it follows the course of the manga and has a similar storyline resolution to its various starts and stops at that. Just keep that in mind while reading this. \\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about what is good first. As I alluded to in my Kantei review this anime is basically a \"medieval/fantasy\" version of Neon Genesis Evangelion, they both have the exact same situation happening but with a different backdrop. They're both about a scenario where humanity has to eek out its existence on the margins while giant creatures from an unknown source are attacking them. Stopping these creatures and making society prepared for their attacks has become the sole reason human society still functions to the extent that it still does in both anime. I think this premise and the mystery around the Titan's is the shows greatest strength and a strong initial bedrock of intrigue and easy drama. I also think that like Evangelion, Titan takes this situation seriously and tries to show how society would really function under these harsh conditions and its world building to that effect is one of it's best accomplishments. Based of this I really wanted to like this show as the world is so interesting and yet for reasons, I'll state throughout the review it never really uses this great initial starting premise for anything interesting we can't already imagine the minute we get told this setup. \\n\r\nThis is going to seem like a really weird statement if you go on to read the rest of this review, but I don't hate this show. In fact a lot of what I don't like about the story hasn't even happened yet in the anime, it's the manga and extended canon. I can kind of passively enjoy this show at times and there are a lot of small elements of it that won't be mentioned here that I like. The main point of this little paragraph is that this isn't a show like K-on or Kill Me Baby for me that I find physically painful to watch. It's overall concept rather than what is happening on the surface level is what I don't like about this story. Although there are some things like the characters and the action that I'm not too fond of on the surface level either. Just keep this in mind because I don't want to exaggerate how bad I find the actual show. It's not a great story in my opinion but if you want a general recommendation for some action schlock with some cool concepts here and there, it can work on that very limited level of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nSo let's talk about the medium shiz. The show looks like most action/fantasy shows of a more serious nature and it doesn't ever look particularly great or bad. Its visuals are functional and work to the extent that they get the story across like an old ass car taking me from one point to another. I found the music a little below average and forgettable to the extent that it existed. I can say the same for the voice acting, I just didn't care about any of this shit. This shows general aesthetics and art direction is kind of like living in a house that has just enough furniture for life to function, but not be too comfortable or enjoyable. What I mean to say by that to be absolutely clear is that when I compare this to other shows like it, I don't get a sense of style, extra polish or anything special in its art. In fact, the most impressive thing about it is how this show manages to make fights between massive flesh golems seem understated and bland. I found the action, in particular, underwhelming and even though they tried their hardest to make you feel this David and Goliath struggle with the way the fights work, I found my self less and less interested with every battle that happened. I think the show wanted you to feel a culmination of awesomeness when the two titans finally fought, but like with every other aspect of the action, I just ain't give a shit. I think a problem with the show is we are constantly told how destructive Titans are, but we aren't ever given a real sense of the scale of this threat in a way that seems tangible, a lot of their destruction is done off screen and what we are shown isn't that impressive. There also seems to be this weird duality in the Titans movements, either they're running at high speed or they are standing stationary and moving their limbs slowly. If this was a real life movie I might be able to excuse this lack of variety in their movement, but as an animated show, I expect a lot more out of these fights than what we get. I want to see Godzilla level destruction to this society or at least some exciting shit happening. To the shows credit and this where we bottom out with the slight positives, there weren't any major miss steps or anything that looked terrible. Like I said before everything was functional in the show. \\n\\n\r\nAs a side note and since I mentioned real-life movies when I think of the Titans running and the overused shot used to convey this it always reminds me of the shot used Ad nauseam of the \"trolls\" running in Trolls 2. Only that shot grows to be funnier and funnier the more it lazily used in that film and the only thing that grows with Titan's overused animations is my sense of utter displeasure.\\n\\n\r\nI wanna talk a little bit about the nature of plot holes and while it might seem like they're the bread and butter of a snide critic of media like myself, the reality is I personally don't think they're that important except in specific cases involving a show or stories main plot. I have an example I always like to use to illustrate this point involving the Harry Potter series, which I'm using for specific reasons that will be made clear later. So what if Harry and the gang are laughing with Ron's twin brothers and they offhandedly mention that time traveling vampires exist in this fictional universe? Well, these might be real creatures in the Potterverse, but this also might be a joke. Now a pedantic critic might jump on this immediately and start talking about how the concept of time traveling vampires would give us a bunch of unanswered questions about this universe and their application to it. As many critics of Harry Potter actually did with the concept of Time Turners as a plot device. I, however, would not take major issue with these things because the possibility of small plot holes being opened up by side things that don't matter to the core thrust of a stories general arc isn't that concerning to me. At the same time I don't think it's a sign of a great writer or teller of a story to start adding over complications to the narrative that might cause potential plot holes, but the point is if the overall story is otherwise good I can forgive some small mistakes made on the road to a good payoff. What would be concerning to me is if at the end of the fourth book JK lolling revealed that Voldemort is, in fact, a time-traveling vampire right before icing Cedric Diggory and then this aspect of the plot was never touched upon or mentioned again except as some story convenience from time to time to explain how Voldy appears in certain places when it's convenient. This would hinder the payoff of the fourth book which is the culmination of those early years and it would make us ask a bunch of unnecessary questions about the nature of a key character that overcomplicates a major part of the story to a point of absurdity. I wouldn't even say this would \"ruin\" the story if it otherwise stayed the same but it would bring my estimation of it down quite a few pegs. \\n\r\nNow, in my opinion, the story of Harry Potter is actually a good one, at least it is up to that fourth book, but what if we're talking about a story that isn't even that enjoyable in the first place? Well, then each plot hole just further and further makes an already bad story lose even more steam. What if your story is about giants being an existential threat to your society and then you find significant ways in which to reduce this threat that you subsequently ignore? Well, that would kind of be like Harry going on a quest to get the Deathly Hollows and eliminate the Horcruxes when his ass could have just used a Time-Turner and staked baby vampire Voldemort in the heart. It makes an already bad resolution to a story seem pointless on top of it. Well, guess what kids, that very thing happens in this show numerous times. Keep this in mind as we go on to talk about the bigger problems with this show. \\n\\n\r\nSo the way in which this show is not at all like the aforementioned Evangelion and the start of how, why and where it's disappointing is how it resolves it's mystery plot. Here is the thing about shows relying on mysteries, people have to be as invested in the payoff as they were with the initial mystery and that is not as easy as it sounds. The biggest problem I have with Titan is that everything you expect to happen once the initial mystery is introduced happens almost to a \"T.\" I said there might be spoils in this review at the start, but the truth is the anime is spoiled if you have two brain cells to rub together and have basically seen any story with a premise like this in the past 100 years. It never veered off the path and surprised me at all. Aside from the general payoff being a letdown, a lot of aspects of the story beyond the initial world building are also a letdown. I mean look at all that text below this particular sentence, this show is truly an evergreen of disappointment even in climate changes abnormally long winter's. \\n\r\nI would go into more detail on this and explain line by line what I think is wrong, but I think it's easier to ask you to just imagine what you think the resolution of this mystery is and I guarantee you will hit upon it without really trying nine times out of ten. I have a thing about \"spoilers\" the first thing is that I don't really believe that a good story can be spoiled, but I respect that other people think this. So building off that belief I also don't ever feel inclined to \"spoil\" a story that I don' t particularly like. I think even stories I don't like deserve a fair shake and I'll let other people enumerate on the merits of this in a specific sense concerning the details of what happens here.  So instead of talking about what I thought was disappointing about the resolution of this story in that aforementioned specific sense, I'll talk more generally about how this was disappointing to me. An extremely brief synopsis is this, the Titans start out a mysterious threat that needs to be combatted but then were told first that they were created by humans and through complicated ways and means they're just some power fantasy bullshit that you might as well calculate in power levels, because this show basically becomes an average shonen at the end of the day. Guess what lads and lasses, them titans were created by humans to benefit more powerful humans and keep people in line and unaware of the broader circumstances of the world, so there's technically more to the story, but that's basically it and this resolution is just lame for a lot of reasons. The main being what I already stated and just how cliche and overused the \"we secretly created this threat to keep the rabble in line premise is.\" I mean it's even overused in reality I've seen enough false flags in one lifetime, that I have forgotten what a real drape look like waving free in the breeze. Listen kids, if we cant rally positively over this review, then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb that will bring us together. \\n\\n\r\nThe first basic problem with the above resolution to the story is even though they go with a cliche plot my dog could write at this point, they can't even keep this premise clear and easy to understand. Heres where them plot holes and dips come in. At one point we learn the Titans were like prisoners that got turned into super powerful beings why? At first I thought it might be for some risky but logical reason like they were used for construction, manual labor or war or something like that, but no the story just kind of leaves that prisoner plot point hanging because I guess it's just self-evident we need to turn people we no longer want in society into an existential threat that can easily backfire on us. Instead of using the Titans to build walls the walls are made of Titans. What the fuck? I mean I can see a more clever plot using this in interesting metaphorical ways, but again Titan goes nowhere with this revelation, it is basically there to be shocking and it isn't that shocking as much as it is stupid. \\n\r\nOne Titan or a guy that can turn into one helped found this society and he and others want to give other unwilling people this power. Now I don't have much of a social life as might be indicated by the amount of time I can invest in these pointless reviews, but I can imagine what having one is like. As much as I can imagine having friends, I can also imagine hating people and having real enemies. In all those imaginings I never thought. \"Damn, what I need to do is take these people I hate and give them the means to easily destroy my life.\" I mean maybe it's commonplace to take people unwilling or that you don't like and make them gigantic beings that can destroy a city, but I guess I missed this basic facet of social reality. What I'm trying to say with all this is I need to get out more and I cordially invite all you fucc bois and thots to come into the mental hellscape that is my reality. \\n\r\nI think the show wanted to use these as clever dead ends and inroads to an interesting story, but they just don't really work. Again as stated heavily above, I'm not here to point out minor plot inconsistencies and for all I know, the manga clearly explains all this and even has charts explaining why gigantic people make the bestest prisoners, hell I'm not perfect maybe the anime clearly answers these and I was too busy looking at the other screen to hear why this was necessary. These things might have great answers but the bigger problem is this was all what I expected, this exact plot with these types of dumb problems. These plot holes and inconsistencies wouldn't have mattered in a better story and they might even be turned into possible interesting twists and strengths with more clever writing. They weren't here though, they were just large infected wounds left to fester on an already dying Titan.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't help but read ahead about the things I missed and to try and make sure the things I perceived as dumb with the show weren't as bad as I thought they were in that reading about it I learned even more displeasing shit that is sprinkled throughout this review and warned you about at the start. There is one crucial detail though that I think really takes the cake on why this premise is really wasted on this show. So the last dumb thing ever happens and in a turn of fate, you're told that modern nations akin to our own exist and their technology makes easy work of the Titans. Like with a lot of things in the story this plot point serves only to nerf the realism and threat we're supposed to care about. It also makes me wonder about the nature of these other countries, they're seemingly filled with humans like us and the people in the walled country and yet they don't act at all like the way a modern country would act in relation to a primitive one. You see here in reality where we live, if you as a modern nation are told that a resource-rich smaller country exists and that the harm to you is minimal in overtaking them, you make up an excuse to conquer them. You then tell them and your own people it's for their own benefit and the government and a few lucky preselected businessmen walk off into the sunset with all that countries resources in tow. You also use the denizens of this country as a source of cheap labor while you extract all their wealth and then leave when it is no longer valuable to you or they finally become modernized and it is no longer easy to readily push them around through conventional means. Either way, while you're doing this to them you also force them to buy your own goods which are usually cheaply made consumer products in exchange for their actually valuable resource based capital. If they resist at this level of the game, then in at least one historical case, what you do is invent a product that they literally get addicted to and can't live without. Like Opium in China. We call this basic facet of material reality imperialism and it is essential to modern nations because capitalism relies on the constant extraction of resources and the opening of new markets. In fact, if you look at the financial times of any modern newspaper you'll notice that nothing gets these people harder than the phrase \"new market\" as even the perception that one is going to be opened up someway somehow is the most exciting thing to ever happen in their mind. \\n\r\nThere are only a few reasons why that I can think why you wouldn't do this, one being that this is a country that exists because they're within the sphere of influence of another country and the only exist for that reason. Like with North Korea, which only exists because of China and the conclusion of the Korean war in which they wanted a buffer zone between themselves and the US influence in the region. If North Korea was an island out in the middle of the Pacific they would have been conquered already, had a puppet government installed and told to start sending over those goods. This reason is not why the country in Titan isn't taken over. Even with North Korea being within China's sphere of influence, they still want the added protection of defensive nuclear weapons, they want to future proof their own regime. So even in this case a country still feels unsafe and weary of a possible invasion from outside forces. \\n\r\nAnother reason why you might not do this is the people in the country have no wealth to extract. The Sentinelese were in the news recently, they were the tribe the killed that Christian missionary on an island off the eastern coast of India. You might ask yourself why haven't we made contact with these people and the long complicated answer is that we have and there is a really bizarre and interesting history behind it that goes beyond the scope of this review. The good news for the Sentinelese though is that in early western explorations of the island, no minerals, salt deposits or oil was found there otherwise they would have been massacred like East Timor already and had all their resources sent over. This is not why the nation in Titan is not conquered in fact within their walled society they seem to have so many resources that they can be an insular and self reliant country for presumably centuries. Even in a primitive society like this, you have all those mined resources all those precious metals their weapons and jewelry is made out of. You know like the ones that keep us and previously the Soviets invading Afghanistan. Which is not an easy country to get to let alone fight an  ongoing decades long war in. Compare that with civilization in Titan which is in the middle of a verdant grassland plains area that carpet bombing and then a ground invasion would wipe out in a millisecond or two. \\n\r\nWe aren't really given a good reason why these modern countries aren't invading this one aside for story convenience and treaties that amount to the equivalent of a non-aggression pact and those almost never work out in reality anyway. The minute a stronger country wants something from you, just brace yourselves an invasion is coming. The unreality of this one plot additive the introduction of the modern world to this reality of the Titans is so large that it's not so much plot hole, as it is plot titan, mindlessly destroying what little hope a man can have left in all of this. \\n\\n\r\nI wish I knew a surefire way that I could write how disappointing this all is, but the best way to do that would be to just have you watch the show and you should have already done that if you're reading this nonsense. I really tried to think up an analogy or some kind of scenario that emphasizes how lame the payoff is compared to the setup but I just couldn't think of something that encapsulates in a universal way how bad it is. I thought  maybe I could compare it to the disappointment one feels when they realize the worst M. Night Shyamalan twist they imagined was the one that actually happened in the film, but the problem is that what happens in Titan isn't really a \"twist\" so much as it the basic unfolding of the bad story as is. Ok, I think I got it! It's kind of like lighting a firecracker and waiting eagerly to see it explode and then sitting there for twelve hours only to realize it's a candle disguised as a firework and you sat there and just watched it melt the duration of its waxy boring substance. I mean it melted, so something happened, but it certainly wasn't the awesome anime explosion you expected at the start. \\n\r\nI guess a way to illustrate why it's bad aside from just restating it's bad over and over is that it's not just predictable is that it feels like A to B exposition story telling. You're presented with this mystery and interesting world and they proceed to give us a story around it that is exactly what I thought it was going to be, plot beat by plot beat.  If I go to write a story and it's about me driving to the store we generally want something to happen that's different from a regular visit to the local supermarket, but what if the story I wrote was just that, me going to the store? I got dressed, went to my car, drove to the store without any struggle, browsed for the items I needed and then put them in the cart, paid for them and drove back home without any problems. I'm sure that was riveting folks, you were on the edge of your seat wondering if each item would make it to the cart and then it did without a struggle. An even more basic way to say this is the \"see spot run plot\" well the story is about seeing Spot run and he runs. I won't say Titan was as basic as that, but it was as basic as it could be building off its premise and not really veering away from exactly where a story like this usually goes. Now as per usual I have to give some heavy caveats and over explain things to make sure I run this shit into the ground, like a mindless Titan pounding his fist into the dirt. Not all predictive elements in a story are bad. If I'm writing a murder mystery and you as a clever reader saw some of the hints I laid out as to who the killer is, that's a good way of having predictive elements in a story. I once read a creepypasta named \"MR Foggy\" or something to that effect and the story had things at the start of it that hinted towards its conclusion and people criticized it for this reason, but I actually thought it showed that the writer had a good sense of what internal logic meant in relation to the world they were building with the story. I mean sure it could have used a red herring and some sleight of hand to throw clever readers off, but its general predictability in this instance didn't seem like a big detriment to me since it built logically from prior premises of the story in a creative way. A lot of plot points of Game of Thrones and Harry Potter were predicted by readers before the writers actually confirmed these things and their stories weren't bad because of these predictable elements, in fact, they showed the strength of the world and the attention to detail in creating them, in that the background elements help build upon things that were important in later parts of the story.  I think something having internal logic is a measure of whether something being predictable is good or not. A lot of what is predictable about Titan isn't the internal logic of the story building on itself, while the overarching plot moves in interesting directions that might come back to these earlier understated facets of the story, it's the basic building blocks moving from one point to the next with no deviations in the exact way you would imagine they would when you first started watching it. It's going from the car to the cart and back to the car, with no real intrigue or drama added in aside from what's typical of the genre. Does that sound like a rip-roaring thrill ride against giant mysterious creatures? I predict that it doesn't. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a story that countless movies and books have been made about in the past century, including two of the highest grossing movies of their time and that story is called the sinking of the fucking Titanic. One of the things people find intriguing about the real-life event and fictional tales of the boat sinking is that the setting of the Titanic shows us an enclosed space that is also just big enough that it gives us a wide view of society and in particular class structure in its passenger ranks. Similar to stories about the Titanic, AoT has an enclosed look at a rigid class-based society, in a life raft situation that has a lot of potential in showing us things about our own society but in a smaller more digestible way. In fact, it seems like it should be distinctly good at this kind of storytelling with how the story is told in the first few episodes and how the world building of the Titans is setup and yet it does almost nothing with this at all aside from the basic snippets you can imagine it examining. Guess what rich and otherwise powerful people are living high off the hog and benefit from this society like they do the present one and Titan does nothing to show why this is or why it matters in the slightest throughout its duration. I feel like this show set up a situation and I had to imagine a more interesting story and themes happening to get anything out of it. This seems to happen a lot in anim- media in general. Art like life is just a disappointing mess of bullshit, I'm sorry. \\n\r\nA lot of people of my particular political ilk like to attribute fascist intentions to this show and they see immigrants, refugees and non-Japanese Gajin barbarians as stand-ins for the Titans. I can kind of see why someone would see this as an applicable situation to those things and given that a lot of action-oriented anime seems very nationalistic in a way that makes GI Joe seems pinko. It's not hard to attribute bad intentions here. That being said I think it's a mistake because I think it's attributing a theme that's more interesting than what the story can actually muster. I think the Titans themselves would need to have more intentionality and internal motive to fit that narrative. When you think about it, this show is kind of like a zombie apocalypse but instead of a bunch of small enemies, you have a bunch of large Titan's attacking things randomly and for seemingly no internal reason. Should we start attributing nationalist and fascist intentions to zombies too? I think not, like a Titan aiming its sinewy hand over the wall, this shit is reaching. \\n\r\nWell actually in the history of media criticism a lot of people have tried to make zombies a placeholder for \"others\" but again I just don't see the connection unless we stretch the idea in such a loose way as for this situation to be almost analogous to anything. The fact that the Titan's are also being used to keep people insular and ignorant about the rest of the world can just as easily be a metaphor for extreme isolationism as it is nationalistic bigotry. So basically if it's analogous to any Asian state it's not nationalistic Japan which despite it's pretense for its own people was very international in it's intentions and it had to be because it needed to steal certain resources like oil to keep functioning as is, but rather North Korea which is an insular society that has to invent monsters to keep it's people which are essentially hostages to the ruling military establishment in line. The comparison between this state and fascism also isn't really historically accurate as fascism is a modern development that is distinct from feudalism which is what this show actually depicts. I would ascribe the first real quasi-fascist state in history as being that of Oliver Cromwell's regime and the level of modernity and the sophistication of the society isn't big enough to even come to that level in Titan. Ironically you need a modern society with a modern economy to enact cavemen like nationalistic ideals to the level that fascism exists at. You also need the military power for imperialism and other countries to invade to have enough wealth to live off of and sustain that military power which I have already shown isn't really possible with this society earlier in the review. If anything they are about to be invaded because all they have is hook shots and rope. \\n\r\nTo return again to my zombie comparison. In fact, the lack of intentionality of the Titans is part of what I think makes the fights uninteresting aside from what I stated earlier with the animation. There is no drama between protagonists and antagonists in this show and their cant be because the animalistic nature of the Titan's makes that impossible to happen. Now, this isn't necessarily bad the Titans themselves might not have dramatic interplay to contribute to the story, but a more clever writer could use their natural \"evil\" as a context for drama between the human characters. The way zombie apocalypse stories usually do. But then the Titans end up being people and you can be a Titan and all this bullshit that over-complicates a simple setup for potentially deeper stories.... I mean really just fuck it. This story always finds a way to nerf any potential goodness it might have had. \\n\r\nAnyway, me and my bois been thinking, instead of killing them Titans, we gonna turn our weapons on those rich fuckers on the hill. No gods, no masters anime ghetto blast ya. Oh, wait you had the same idea but you just want to keep the same dumb society with the same rules? You really can't even get this Robin Hood shit right? Godddamnit. \\n\r\nGoing back to wanting to imagine themes I think it's almost impossible not to want to do this with this story because what you get in the end is magical power fantasy bullshit on top of a podium that seemingly promised us something much deeper and profound. This is one story where the fan fiction might be better by default than the official canon writing. So in the aforementioned Evangelion, we come to understand the nature of the problem the people are going through in that world, but only just enough that keeps us interested until the ending takes us in a completely different direction. This completely different direction does a few things for the show, like making it one of the greatest of all time, but also it leaves some of the plot details especially those concerning the threat a little murky. By doing this it makes it hard to criticize the shows internal logic, as it's never laid out enough to be a rubric to start citing things wrong with it. This is where Titan's threat and the resolution it builds up to start's to fail hard. So like after everything is done and le epic heroes have saved the day their first thought is to take Wall Maria and the lands contained within back. This might sound like a good plan to you if like the main character you're an over emotional moron attached to some ruins. News flash kid, you found out the nature of the Titans, your shitty wall system and the society contained within can be put to rest since you know you can reverse and positively engineer the process in your favor. Listen, real close kid... You can make those big Titan's, you know the whole reason you have these walls human again, the process is shown to be reversible through extreme means and through the knowledge that we see people turning into and not being Titans. I couldn't give a fuck less about the Wall. You can retake the world back and use your knowledge of Titans as an offensive measure against those that remain in the wild and other threats.  And you can do all this by making an army of Titan's your self. This is why the power fantasy elements don't work with this realistically built up world, the details we give could lead to a much easier resolution. This is why I cited the murkiness of Evangelion as a positive, it masks obvious problems and those pesky plot holes that might have come up about the threats resolution if they went with a more conventional anime ending like Titan did here and failed hard with a vengeance at that. \\n\r\nOh, wait they can't do any of the above because modern reality exists outside the walls of this city. Again WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE? Did you do this? Stahp it plz. Was it just to piss me off and break my titan sized heart and balls?\\n\r\nAnother way in which this shows is not like Evangelion at all is its characters. Their personalities and design leave almost no impression on me and even after watching the show twice all the way through I have a hard time distinguishing who is who and why they matter. The main character is also just a boring dud, I'm having a hard time even picturing him now as I write this and I'm literally, figuratively, metaphorically and allegorically looking at a picture of him. Wait was the main character even a guy? I'm starting to forget about these boring characters more and more as I write this. As much as I hated character's in shows like K-on and Kill Me Baby, at least I can say I remember them and their names. Titan's characters are so forgettable, I think this show made me develop a form of facial aphasia and now I can't distinguish individual people in a crowd, thanks a lot Titan. So when I think real hard on it, I remember the guy who runs the place was your basic mean old man archetype and then there was the black haired girl who liked potatoes and I kept thinking. \"When they gonna focus on her, she's the hot one!\" But then they never did and now I can't even like the show in quantifiable fappability levels that I can display on a chart for an oral presentation at college. I can only imagine in my heart and in my dreams, a show where she loves me as much as she loves potatoes. Seems no one around me comprehends my potato, guess I'm just a spud boy looking for that real tomato. So on a more serious note, nothing really happens to these characters, they don't have great arcs of development and they aren't entertaining on a more basic level, they mostly exist to fit an anime trope checklist and be exposition signposts that keep the story going. \\n\r\nI really want to emphasize in this particular review that despite my harping on it in this review and others, things can still be fun and cliche at the same time. I mean the first three Star Wars films are a series of thousand-year-old hero tropes with some spaceships added in and people like that. A lot of the stories I like are basic, I'm not that hard to please, it's not just that these are overused and cliche, it's that they're overused and cliche in a way that just isn't compelling in a way I can imagine them being.  So with that in mind, back to the main character for a second, he is kind of like Edward Elric from Full Metal Alchemist, but without any of the charm, believability or good writing. So he isn't at all like that character, but I think they kind of wanted him to be like that or at least it's the closest approximation to what they were going for that I can think of given the genre and the way they act. You see the thing about Edward Elric is him and his brother have a series of large struggles that are easy to understand, they want their bodies intact again and beyond that, they want the happy family life they missed out on. Their story isn't groundbreaking or something no one has heard before in fact what is compelling about it is its familiarity, we can understand the loss of family and the guilt over major mistakes rather easily. On top of these easy to understand motivations and goals Edward has, him and his brother also have concerns and goals involving the other characters in the story and like with the two main characters I can understand these characters motivations and why their struggle in life matter even though the world is an alternate reality where alchemy exists instead of modern chemistry. The problem with Titan's main character is that even though I can understand his \"struggle\" in an abstract sense and I can perceive a want to survive in a harsh reality where Titans exist, I never understand it or more importantly feel it at any moment in the show. I mean I know he wants to be a hero and do heroic things, but I'm not exactly sure why I should care as a viewer aside from seeing the story move along on the screen. His main goals as stated earlier don't even make sense. There also isn't enough dramatic interplay or interesting characterization with the other characters to get me to care about this world beyond the main character. I won't belabor this particular point too hard since I have mentioned this before in other reviews on here and RYM, but the main take away is you can't just show and do emotional things in a story, you have to actually make us care and feel these things along with the characters first. \\n\\n\r\nI think that's the problem with this story in general, it just kind of happens and I'm never expected or invited to care at any point, like one of those fake aquariums that show the same five fish doing fish things over and over. This is an anime show where people fighting Titan's do the same Titan fighting things you expect them to do over and over. When I started writing this review I actually thought the show was pretty good and I even had to change some sentences at the start after writing the rest because this ended up being more negative than I initially intended. I convinced myself in one review or less with no money down that this show just ain't that good. I'm mindless like a Titan I'm just attacking shit that I ain't even know the purpose or significance of. Aside from it's starting premise and the world itself there really isn't much too praise. I think if you look at my review as a whole you should take away one crucial message and that is... I might have liked it more as a painting is what I'm trying to say. I'll let you figure out what that means.",

            "content": "If you have ever dreamed about fighting giant beings, anywhere between three to fifteen meters in height, then this is the anime for you. \r\nThere are many people out there that will tell you that Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan is overrated. And then there are those who are complete fanboys/fangirls and think that Attack on Titan is the best anime of the year. As for me? I am apart of the latter group. I may not be a complete fangirl over Attack on Titan, but I can give credit where credit is due. Anime this year... for better words has been ratherlackluster. The winter (2012/13) and spring anime for 2013 wasn't as great as seasons that came before it (with a few exceptions of course, namely being Hataraku Maou-sama). With that being said, I felt that we really needed something great to come out, so that anime fans like myself wouldn't lose interest. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Attack on Titan might not be the most original ever told. Looking around the media you see it being done all the time. I mean, if you're looking for a story about a group of people forced to fight against the things trying to kill them, then go watch the Walking Dead or something, because you have your typical zombie movie/TV show. What makes Attack on Titan special is the way the idea of having to fight for freedom is presented to the audience. How many giant people eating titan animes/TV/movies do you see floating around the market? There is really only one answer. Attack on Titan makes itself feel unique and new, which is surely hard to do in any piece of media. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nProduction I.G really did go all out on this one, which one can easily tell by the first episode. As most people know or should know by now, the anime is based of the manga by the same name by the mangaka: Hajime Isayama. Many people have criticized Attack on Titan for its art, or rather it's art style. Sure, the character designs doesn't look like the typical art you would find in a romance comedy anime that is being produced by J.C Staff. But there is something unique about that art that you start to love. And unique is something Production I.G does very well. CGI is one of the main factors in Attack on Titan's art. Used in almost all 3DMG sequences, the use of CGI adds a freshness factor to the anime. Often CGI is something that is used in anime, and used very badly. But Attack on Titan uses it to its advantage in order to enhance what is being watched.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 11/10\\n\\n\r\nSound is definitely one of the best things about Attack on Titan. Ever since the first episode, the opening theme 'Guren no Yumiya' as become somewhat iconic in Japan and even in the west. Obviously so from the amount of parodies there are. Linked Horizon, the group that preformed both 'Guren no Yumiya' and the second OP 'Jiyuu no Tsubasa' did a great job with capturing the mood and atmosphere of Attack on Titan. It's not hard to see why the sound is so popular. With the music being composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, the same mastermind who brought us the OST for animes like Guilty Crown and Blue Exorcist, fans could expect nothing less. The OST for Attack on Titan is nothing less than beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is without a doubt the weakest part of Attack on Titan. With a lot of anime nowadays having characters that forward the plot in no way shape of form, Attack on Titan seems to be a breath of fresh air. All character's seem to have there place within the show, not just thrown in to be comic release or there simply for fanservice. This is definitely a high point of the characters, with the low point being the cliche and sometimes overused tropes that a lot of characters seem to be based around. This is quite evident in Attack on Titan. The main character is somewhat annoying, even a fan of Attack on Titan could tell you that. He's the hot-headed (a part time) brooding guy who doesn't seem to be good at anything. Then you have the other main character, a female who has the same personality as character such as: Rei Ayanami from Evangelion and Yuki Nagato from Haruhi Suzumiya. The silent, strong girl seems to have become a common character archetype throughout the years, but you can't help but love that character because they're so awesome. So while there are many faults on characters throughout Attack on Titan, there are so some great characters in the mix.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is a category that is different for everyone. Some people will hate the anime and some people will love it. It all has to do with personal preference. As someone who has read the manga, I feel as though this adaptation was done right. It didn't 100%  follow the manga right down to its last feature, but who really wants that anyway? It's like going to the cinema to see your favourite book that has been made into a movie. Changes had to be made and somethings had to be re-ordered. Attack on Titan is no different. The manga doesn't matter though. There will always be fans that won't read the manga, and as a stand-alone anime, it was done really well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10",

            "content": "I wonder, why is it that today's audiences are so invested in stories that center around people suffering through harsh trials that, more often than not, showcase the worst aspects of this world? Is it some sadistic pleasure at seeing others jump through flaming hoop after flaming hoop, despite deserving better? Is it some internal relief that we get, knowing that regardless of our own lives tribulations, that it's possible for others to suffer far worse than us? Either is possible, but i choose to go for a third, more positive option. Through these works, we see the best of humanity in the worst ofsituations. Whether it be Battle Royale, Game of Thrones, or, for this review, Attack on Titan, we see a strong sense of will, determination, and faith, that shines in the center of the worst the world has to offer. But, with so many of these kinds of stories out there these days, what makes Attack on Titan stand out from the crowd to gain it the immense popularity it currently has?\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn an unknown part of the world, during an unknown time period, colossal monsters called Titans, whose only purpose in life is to feed on humans for pleasure, have taken the place of apex predator and forced humanity into hiding. With only a small percentage of humanity left, they build walls to surround cities in order to keep the Titans out, and live their lives trapped, yet alive. But after 100 years of not seeing a single Titan, a colossal Titan kicks the wall in and sends the outer layer of the city into panic. In the frenzy, one boy named Eren Jaeger, watches first hand as his mother is devoured by a Titan. Driven by rage and a desire for vengeance, he joins the Survey Corps with his childhood friends, Mikasa and Armin, to fight against the Titans, and satisfy his thirst for retribution, and find freedom beyond the walls they've spent their lives trapped in. Attack on Titan is a classic tale of overcoming trials to find what you desire, but, where most of these tales often chart the progress of their goals, Attack on Titan follows a \"one step forward, two steps back\" program. It seems that the closer Eren and the Survey Corps get to rising up against the Titans, reality always follows to rub just how hopeless it is in their face. Question after question arises, with no answers in sight, and by the end of the series, humanity has yet to take their step towards defeating the Titans. Normally this would all be very frustrating, if it wasn't for the fact that the story never just strings us along. It is a hopeless situation, and the characters actions towards rising up are never completely in vain. It's a story about overcoming suffering, regardless of how futile it seems, and charging forward with nothing more than hope, which is enough to make a compelling, and somewhat optimistic series for people to find themselves invested in. Sadly, Attack on Titan suffers from being an unfinished show, ending on a cliffhanger and leaving it's audience unsatisfied. Considering it's success though, a second season should be on the way as soon as there's enough source material to work off of. Unless, that is, Studio Wit all of sudden starts hating the oodles of money the show has put in their pockets.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan was done by Studio Wit, a subsidiary of Production I.G, and their first major work. The art in Attack on Titan is eye-catching to say the least. The backgrounds are surprisingly detailed, implementing the CGI to good use for the buildings, and vibrant forests for outside the wall. The character designs are worth noting as well. Seeing as the setting has more German influence than Japanese, the characters are designed for a more Western look, putting aside the show's token Oriental, Mikasa. What's more each of the characters are outfitted with thick black outlines, giving the shore a more comic book feel. Though the most notable thing about the designs, would have to be those of the Titans themselves. Their bodies are, large and misshapen, with sickening flesh tones, but the faces had a bad habit of getting more and more ridiculous as the show went on, to the point where the Titans were more laughable than intimidating. As for the animation, it looks absolutely marvelous when it wants to, implementing a three-dimensional style to match the humans maneuver gear, not to forget about the splendid choreography that goes into using said 3-D maneuver gear, making for some flat out gorgeous action scenes. The rest of the time though, the animation can be quite lazy and often lags. That's not even bringing into account the times when the show would decide to stop the animation all together to implement still screens. It's not a bad looking show by any means, but it could've looked better. Of course it could've looked a lot worse too, if not for three simple words. Tetsurou Fucking Araki. Simply looking at his track record, comprising of Death Note, High School of the Dead, and Guilty Crown, tells you two things about him. The shows he directs look really good and usually end up being huge successes. Araki often implements a style of bombast and erraticism, taking complete advantage of the animation medium, and simultaneously creating copious amounts of online memes, providing his shows with free advertising. While Attack on Titan isn't as gorgeous as Guilty Crown, or as stylized as Death note, his directorial style still provides enough passion and adrenaline to take this show's visuals to new heights.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe OST for the show was done by Hiroyuki Sawano, whose previous works include Blue Exorcist and the aforementioned Guilty Crown. The show itself is a driving force of adrenaline and blatancy, so what better to suit it than heavy dramatic sounds, fully orchestrated with the obligatory choirs, crashing down on you while one of the characters charges off dramatically to go decapitate a Titan. Outside of the action, the show is complimented by vocal chorus pieces to suit the more moody and less intense scenes. Of course, you can't talk about Attack on Titan, without talking about it's openings. One of the things that sold Attack on Titan to so many people right off the bat, was it's first OP, Guren No Yamiya by Linked Horizon, which soon became an overnight internet sensation with hundreds of parody videos. To be honest, it is kind of as good as people say, but that shouldn't detract attention from the show's second opening, Jiyuu no Tsubasa, also by Linked Horizon, which is just as good if not better than the first opening. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOne of the bigger criticisms of the show is about it's cast of characters, where the words, undeveloped and bland most often appear. I'm going to respectfully disagree. Attack on Titan is not a complex show, nor does it ever try to act like it is. It's a straightforward action/adventure show meant to touch base with it's audience's own humanity. So doesn't it seem fitting that it's characters do the same? After all, sometimes simple characters are more effective than complex ones, especially when the point of these characters is to bring out human traits that the audience can connect with. There's nothing wrong with complexity in characters, and some shows even manage to blend complexity with humanity. But there are plenty of cases where a story might focus more on analyzing a characters inner workings that they come off as unnatural and robotic. In a 25 episode anime, where the themes are about the inner will and determination of humanity, simplicity works better. Eren is bitter and angry at the Titans, yet still desires freedom and the safety of his loved one above all else. Mikasa wants nothing more to protect Eren out of gratitude and love, gained from his part in providing her with a new life. Armin wants to find the courage within him to use his own abilities to assist his friends in the hope that they may someday live in peace. It's hard not to feel sympathy for the characters of this show, even those that don't necessarily deserve it, because the emotions they feel are justified and honest. Not to say they didn't need development, and some got it. Eren eventually learns to put his anger aside so it doesn't get in the way of what's important. Armin learns to put his fear aside so that he can use his intellect to help out. Jean decides to end his own selfish streak and step up as a leader for his fellow cadets. Not to say the cast doesn't have flaws. While i will defend Mikasa as a great female character and not just some emotionless guard fog, but she is a bit predictable after a while. Plus there are plenty of characters like Sasha and Connie which have yet to get any real attention outside of comic relief to bounce of the main characters. I've read the manga, so I know whether or not they develop, but this is a review on the show, so i'll be judging the characters on what they are, not what they could or will be. Still, Attack on Titan does give us an engaging cast to resonate with, whether it be their desire for vengeance, for freedom, for reason, and, of course, to protect what they hold dearest. Some people may criticize the simple designs for these characters, but i can't help but prefer humanity over complexity. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) Overall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe question i expect to hear at least once after posting this review is, \"does it live up to the hype?\" and, quite frankly, it doesn't matter. Hype is a result of the community not the show itself, so to say something to overhyped or overrated is not a flaw of the show, but your own personal flaw. I hope that you can ignore the hype, and decide for yourself whether it's a show deserving of it's attention based off it's own quality. In my opinion, it kind of is. Attack on Titan is a thrill ride of action, impact, and pure enjoyment. It may be unfinished, but it was clearly planned with a second season in mind, which is all but confirmed, and will most likely clear up any loose plot threads and unresolved character arcs. I won't dismiss it's flaws, but i can look past them to see a quality show, one that i can recommend for all anime fans. Anyways, that's all for now. Til next time.",

            "content": "Perhaps what more than anything characterizes Attack on Titan is the same which characterizes the eponymous villains as opposed to ordinary humans, namely overabundances. There are so many promising concepts, mysteries, interesting characters, so much excellent music and well-done action. Yet even so, at the end of this first part of the story, one doesn't feel quite satisfied. Many shows complete their stories after 25 episodes, but at the end of Attack on Titan we don't really know anything more about what is going on than we did seeing the main character and his sister in the beginning, as children, awing over the part ofthe military they would join as grown-ups. New questions are being raised up until the very end of the last episode, while few previous are resolved, and thus it's difficult to see it all as anything but a beginning.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an outstanding beginning though. The animation occasionally suffers too much from cost-reducing stills, but the 19th century-looking world of Attack on Titan is vividly brought out, and the visuals particularly impressively manage to make the many characters easy both to remember and love. The powerful soundtrack also deserves special mention, even if the opening and ending songs of the second half of the show do not stand up to the ones of the first half, but I guess that's just an excuse to skip them and get along with the story quicker. \\n\\n\r\nIn a way, it's pretty silly. Humankind lives behind colossal, dam-like walls after giants began attacking them, and it's up to young, attractive, but all very idiosyncratic people dressed in dark green raincoats, carrying something like steampunk jetpacks, to hit the giants not necessarily stopped by the wall at the back of their necks, their only weak spots. What makes the story gripping, aside from the many awe-inducing action scenes the plot justifies, is some of the ingenious ways the concept is put to use to create rather original situations, but just as much the meticulousness of the plot's execution. Few proper war films manage to even get close to the dread Attack on Titan associates with the giants after only a single episode, partly in thanks to the almost surreal ridiculousness of their appearance, but also by the willingness to confront the characters fully with the brutality of conflict, among other things by unexpected killings. Yet it's perhaps a six-episode arc of the series, taking place entirely on the move, that manages to impress the most in terms of construction. All these things make it easy to forgive the occasional outrageous plot manoeuvres done to keep the show's pace as high as it is.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, it's hard to say what to make of Attack on Titan. At this point it's not even quite completely obvious what it is. While the show's mysteries and characters are probably its most interesting aspects, the focus on action of the last episode makes one wonder whether perhaps it's really first and foremostly about this. Then again, maybe the plot cash-outs are being saved for the upcoming movie. What's in any case quite clear about Attack on Titan is that it's a fresh breath of air in the shonen genre with a promising future hard not to look forward to.",

            "content": "[REUPLOAD]\r\n\"I'm going to kill all the Titans!\"\r\nWhy, of course you are.\r\n\"Zombie\" is a genre. It's not survival horror, it's \"Zombie\" respectively. This is because Zombie follows a completely different set of rules, tropes and clich\u00e9s, while survival horror is a vague category that could really be much broader. Shingeki no Kyojin is not a horror show, not a serious Seinen, or a well written show. It's a disappointing mess of a Shounen zombie show. \r\nTo qualify as a Zombie show, several plot points are required. You need a menace/zombies, the survivors/prey of the menace, as well as a location where supplies are limited or scarce.The Titans, humans, and the 3 walls fit under these points. Congratulations, SnK qualifies in the preliminaries. But does it hold up? \\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely not; SnK completely lacks the themes that make a Zombie media good, or at least entertaining. It's predictable with a lack of tension thanks to plot holes, Gary Stu protagonists who for some reason can't die, and no direct relation to what\u2019s happening to the characters on the screen. The main selling of a Zombie media is emotions akin to fear or anxiety. Basically never knowing who's going to die, or how and when people do die, it should mean something, since you as the viewer feel a connection as if you were surviving with that person all along the stories direction. \\n\\n\r\nNow you'll say, \"But people die in SnK all the time! Have you even seen the show?!?!?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nPeople don't die in SnK, cardboard backgrounds SHAPED like people die in SnK. These \"people\" have no memorable names or development going for them, just one trait that you remember them by; like black kid or short kid. These \"people\" die like frogs in a grinder, for nothing more than mere shock value, which is an ironic saying because there is no value in it at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters that have names, but not any actual depth mind you; don't die at all. They are beaten, eaten, and torn, yet they still live. Why?\\n\\n\r\nBecause Eren is Naruto. He's going to save the day, defeat the enemy, keep his friends alive, and obtain a secret power that makes him near invincible (a terrible shounen trope). He's a bland and unlikable shounen protagonist straight from the box o' clich\u00e9s, written by a third grader in purple crayon. He also has his girlfriend who is super strong, and together they can take on entire titan armies. This reincarnation of Jesus is what breaks the whole atmosphere of a Zombie show. Zombie shows are supposed to bring out the human aspects of its inhabitants, mortality being a major theme. Having a Gary Stu with more plot armor than a castle has bricks, breaks the human formula.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with SnK is that it has the nerves to use the, \"IT HAPPENED OFF SCREEN\" tactic. 5 years of training that's supposed to make everyone stronger? Skipped, and even with this aforementioned training, hundreds die on the FIRST mission. 20% of the population dying? Skipped dawg. Titan behavior observation? Haven't seen him. All these plot points could be used for character development, a concept unknown in SnK. \\n\\n\r\nAnd don't talk to me about the pacing. This show takes its god damn time on absolutely the most irritatingly absurd predicaments. Eren and friends spend an entire episode (That takes an eternity mind you) about to be fired upon from his allies, all for them finally to come to the conclusion that they should ask their allies not to fire. What?!?! Anyone could have done that without a second thought, and it wouldn't take them Armin's \"special tacticool talent\", which by the way, doesn't exist. He's just a useless whiny annoyance, but at least he's under human restrictions, unlike Mr. KILLALLTITANS.\\n\\n\r\nThe menace of a Zombie show usually has a set of rules that are observed by the characters and then exploited in order to survive. Example, zombies are attracted to humans to eat. While a few general rules are known about the Titans, every different Titan acts randomly. Some Titans are slow, sluggish and easily killed; while others jump super high and grab you lightning fast with their mouths. Some Titans can run faster than humans with gear, and then again some can't even walk properly. The only explanations we ever get, is that any Titan that acts differently is an \u201cabnormal.\" Thanks to this asinine bullshit, not only are the humans broken, but the menaces are as well!\\n\\n\r\nOn Music and Animation\u2026\\n\r\nA very solid sound track; all that can be said is that it's wasted on SnK. The animation is poor quality with 50 million stills in every episode. No such praise is deserved in this category.\\n\\n\r\nAs a reminder, SnK is a SHOUNEN, when it could very easily be a quality Seinen with its original exposition. It\u2019s majorly disappointing that all this potential is to go to waste. SnK might look good in comparison to other shows it\u2019s competing with, but a rock isn\u2019t a diamond just because it\u2019s surrounded by dirtier rocks.\\n\\n\r\nPop quiz. What do we do with poor Shounen?\\n\r\nWe forget about them.\\n",

            "content": "I've been hearing a lot about this anime and how popular it was, but I never really wanted to watch it because I am really reluctant when it comes to shounen anime. Pretty much the only shounen anime I've ever enjoyed was Hunter x Hunter (2011) and Death Note (I'm also starting to get a little bit into Assassination Classroom), but considering the huge fanbase that this anime built, I decided to take a crack at it, and in my conclusive overall review, Shingeki no Kyojin is one of the coolest and most creative anime I've ever watched. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI've seen so many anime withtop-notch plots, from Death Note to Hunter x Hunter. One thing AOT never holds back on is action. I can imagine how difficult it is for writers to create a solid plot that's overwhelmed with action sequences, but AOT maintained itself beautifully. The writers did an excellent job showcasing how threatening the Titans are. They may be giants that seem like they could never keep up with the heroes' speed and agility, but their surprising intelligence is what helps them completely overwhelm humans, making them worthy villains. I actually thought that this anime was just going to be a \"bing-bang-boom\" action show with barely any real significance at all, but the show's drama, characters, and background stories are what hit me harder than any action sequence ever did, even though I'm quite a sucker for some solid action. As I started watching AOT, I got quickly interested in it with it's driving plot and amusing characters, but out of any other episode in the show so far, episode 5 hit me the hardest and was what drove me to watch the rest of 1st season as quickly as I could. The episode was a pure shocker. It's basically one of those episodes that makes you wonder what will happen next, and it's really up to you to find out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really drove this anime. Like Hunter x Hunter, not a single character is bland. In my mind, a bland character is basically one that gives you no feelings or overall emotion. In AOT, we get characters that make you happy (humorously), angry, or bewildered. Another trait that AOT has similar to HxH is the main character. Unlike most anime where the MC is always the smartest and the strongest, in AOT you get Eren, who's is passionate but hot-tempered, emotional, and not always 100% right. That trait really adds more realism to anime and keeps it away from the cartoony side. Even secondary characters get major roles, which is really what any TV show or film really needs to succeed. I really enjoyed the roles of each character, especially the ones who were mostly there for some comic relief (Sasha Blouse, Hange Zoe). One character I've enjoyed watching the most was Levi, mainly because of his pure intelligence, high skill in combat, calm personality, and his father figure-type relationship with Eren.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I know when it comes to anime, AOT has very unique art direction. The characters are heavily outlined and colored very dynamically, which is very amusing to the eye. The animation is really at its best during action sequences as it is crossed with traditional hand-drawn animation and CGI, which is something you don't see very often in anime. The animation is fluid and smooth and the camera movement is very dynamic. I really enjoyed watching characters fly around with their 3D maneuver gear. The ceaseless fluidity of the animation really drove every action sequence and is something that will catch your eye in an instant.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't really pay attention to sound effects in anime, unless it's obviously bad, so I'll just rate the music. What you would expect from any action anime is some epic music. Some action anime rely on heavy rock or metal for action sequences, which are mostly decent to listen to (Fairy Tail). AOT relies on a variety of music categories, such as vocal rock, hybrid orchestral, and traditional orchestral. The hybrid and traditional orchestral music for AOT caught my attention the most. I really enjoyed listening to the OST and ED music and I've taken a special liking into Guren no Yumiya (theme song), E.M.A., and the Levi vs. Female Titan theme.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan has taken a special place in my heart. With its knockout action sequences, intense drama, amusing characters, epic background music, and unique animation, it quickly made a spot in my top 10 anime list, and it's just the first season.",

            "content": "Depicting a world in which the remaining human population seals itself into giant walls to protect against the giant Titans, Attack on Titan focuses on the exploits of young hero Eren Yaeger desiring to destroy the giants to avenge the slaughter of his parents by them. Early episodes of the series are solid in setting up the show's premise as they explore the pasts of Eren and Mikasa and elements to the world of the series such as the importance of the Walls and the harsh training and physical conditioning that those in the Recon Corp armies go through in order to fight the Titans.Also in many instances throughout the first half, the series was effective in setting up tension and suspense from humans whenever the thought of their survival or a Titan encounter had them fearing for their lives. Titan's first half set up some engaging plot twists, such as a shocking development with Eren, that would have you believe that this would be an epic of a series.\\n\\n\r\nSadly as the show shifted into its second half, things start to go downhill with the plotting quality of the series and much of this has to do with the fact that the manga source material of this series is still ongoing. Much of the second half of the series focuses on matters concerning the Female Titan and the series started getting into the bad habit of slowing things to a halt with its pacing. The effective use of mood conveyed from earlier episodes in the series becomes greatly exaggerated here as humans scared witless of the Titans or a certain major character angsting over internal conflict over a revelation with the Female Titan became irksome at many points for my enjoyment of the series and seemed to only be implanted to drag the series out. Worst of all, the series left plenty of questions unanswered concerning the motives of certain characters and factions, as well as elements to the world of the series that Titan alluded to yet never bothered answering. This, again, comes from the manga source material of Attack on Titan still being incomplete. Also while Eren and Mikasa get decently fleshed out, much of the cast to Titan are sadly underdeveloped in background and personality beyond whatever eccentric or stale personalities they are shown to have throughout the TV anime's run.\\n\\n\r\nFor visuals, Titan was pleasing for the most part. Scenery shots sported vivid color and plenty of detail, with human character designs given similar treatment. The designs of the Titans are perhaps the visual highlight of the series being grotesque and well-detailed in their massive designs. The animation features nicely animated battle scenes involving the Recon Corps use of their Maneuver Gear as they move through closed-in areas like forests and towns while battling Titans, with the occasional clashes between Titans tossed in as well. Such scsnes serve as the animated highlight for this series as 3D animation and camera movement is used to depict the fluid movement of Titans and human soldiers moving about using their Maneuver Gear. This nice animation does come at a price as moments outside of these animated sequences feature still shots, speed stripes, characters moving while background movement is still and other animation shortcuts to conserve on budget for the more visually intense moments of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I must admit that Titan is perhaps my biggest disappointment of a series thus far this year. While having a nice start in setting up its premise and having many nicely animated sequences with Titans and soldiers moving via their Maneuver Gear, the series suffers greatly in its second half with dragged out developments and unanswered questions over the bigger picture of things over how and why things were taking place in the world of the series. Had this been animated close to or well after this title's manga source material was complete, then Attack on Titan could have been better in its quality and not leave you hanging over what was going on.",

            "content": "We all know what\u2019s lying at the very top of Mount Hype right now: Shingeki no Kyojin or in other words, Attack on Titan. Sparing you from the generic \u201cIt\u2019s regarded as a masterpiece, but is it? We shall see with this review,\u201d kind of intro, I\u2019ll tell you that no, it\u2019s not a masterpiece but it\u2019s not terrible either. \r\nStory:\r\nRight away the story starts strong with a darker and more epic atmosphere, already backed up by its interesting premise. The mood was already set from the beginning but this show didn\u2019t feel like it was good enough. In a way, the mood and atmospherein Attack on Titan is like fog: the staff keep making the fog thicker and thicker until you can no longer see the surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words: The mood and atmosphere are so focused on that it gets in the way of the story. Although the story is still there, it likes to show despair over and over when it is no longer necessary to show it. Almost everything has to go wrong with a few exceptions so the story has to continue, people must die and we must always see them die or be told about how terrible it was until you get sick of it and we must always see people almost going insane with all this.\\n\\n\r\nIt is understandable that all of this happens in this kind of story and I don\u2019t think everything should\u2019ve been more positive, it\u2019s just that I would rather see plot progression than despair. You could try to tell me that this was the show trying to be psychological and that it was not the atmosphere but that would still be badly executed because it accomplishes nothing and we get to see nothing in the minds of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that but this show also loves sidetracking. The first few episodes had a visible goal but somewhere in the later episodes it is sidetracked by an event of the plot that wasn\u2019t as important as the goal presented before, and that important goal was never reached. With that, the more interesting questions about the story were never answered and only raised more questions. \\n\\n\r\nThe final episodes of the show confused me further. Although they made me realize that this part was more important than it seemed, it failed to tell us more than that and in the end we\u2019re left in the dark about all the more important points of the story. But that\u2019s only about the story, we haven\u2019t even gotten to the characters yet.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the concept of the Titans but unfortunately we got to know anything interesting about them because of this show\u2019s thing for sidetracking. One of the only solid things about this anime is its world-building as we got to see how their society differed from ours with its separate walls and districts to the roles of the various factions of this series. The fact that their culture was different from ours was obvious and I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was very open: a second season is definitely expected from this. If that\u2019s not the case then the ending is terrible. Only the part I mentioned above was \u201csolved\u201d (if you consider a final fight as solved) and the first goal we had in sight was barely touched upon.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, if this doesn\u2019t get a second season I will take one point away from the score of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe fog does not only affect the story: it especially affects the characters. The characters are so drowned in despair that I end up forgetting about them in the sadistic show that is Attack on Titan. This show loves showing as much despair as possible to the characters, and the only ones that have some sort of depth are only some the characters that matter (the ones that were focused on throughout the show; Jean, a supporting character, had a surprising amount of focus so I'm considering him as an exception that I won't mention here). Those that aren\u2019t even supporting characters usually lack common sense and possibly sanity, being suspicious of everything and anything and having lost the ability to see something convenient and be clever about it.\\n\\n\r\nBy episode 13 my brother had even forgotten Eren\u2019s name! We (my brother and I) could barely keep track of the names of the supporting characters and the show assumed that we had that good of a memory when surrounded by so much despair. There were so many character deaths that they pretty much became meaningless and by that point we were pretending that we knew the names of the characters and that they actually mattered. It\u2019s hard to root for humanity when it mostly consists of idiots that don\u2019t have the ability of rational thought and are possibly insane. I know I repeated that but I really want to emphasize this: Humanity was too stupid for me to care about whether they survive or not.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I make a ten page essay on how I thought the characterization in this show was not good, I\u2019ll talk about our main characters or just the characters that matter overall, starting with Eren. Eren seems to be the angrier version of a shounen protagonist, having his focus on his revenge and anger towards Titans but also his desire to protect his friends. Because of this, he was never that interesting and all of the things happening to him just hinted at how special he is but we never get to know why because of the abrupt ending. \\n\\n\r\nAs most people might agree with, the most interesting character is definitely Mikasa but I ended up liking Armin more instead. He might seem useless in the beginning but he seems to be one of the few people in this world that has intelligence and common sense while there were many situations that could\u2019ve gone worse (because I can\u2019t say they went good since that\u2019s almost impossible in Attack on Titan) if it weren\u2019t for him being there and giving the characters a plan to follow. All in all, he had the most development in the show which is an outstanding feat considering Mikasa and the fact that there is barely any development at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I said that Eren was special, I didn\u2019t mean that he was the most special because Mikasa is introduced as being stronger than Eren right at the beginning of the show. She\u2019s calm and stoic and she\u2019s usually the one that keeps Eren in line. It\u2019s pretty bad that in the later episodes, whenever I expected her to do something she would be absent or wasn\u2019t able to since she was one of the better characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe last character I want to talk about, although you might not think he\u2019s important, is Levi who I kindly renamed Dick.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026What? It\u2019s a name! Isn't \u201cCaptain Dick\u201d easier to say than \u201cCaptain Levi\u201d? Anyway, his personality is pretty similar to his name and he\u2019s also a clean freak and blunt. I didn\u2019t hate him, and I still don\u2019t understand his popularity but that\u2019s something else. It seemed like he would barely matter at first but in the later episodes he was practically Eren\u2019s pep talker, like the ones that say the crucial words to the generic shounen protagonists and it gets on their heads, that kind of thing. I have to admit there wasn't as much development from him but there was foreshadowing so I thought of that as a miraculous plus.\\n\\n\r\nThe important and supporting characters are passable in terms of making the plot move forward but that\u2019s not all a character should have. The cast was large but not really that varied in personality with only a few exceptions, most just fading away into the fog and only seen when they die but by that point, I already forgot about their existence. I do have to admit that the mystery behind who the antagonist was in reality was really well done until the final episodes when they literally gave it away.\\n\\n\r\nAt least they gave it (the antagonist since I don\u2019t want to give it away) depth but it was only in the final episodes where it was pretty much revealed although it\u2019s depth nonetheless so it\u2019s a miracle in my perspective.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nI really like the show\u2019s art style with actual noses (YES!) and fitting with the overall atmosphere of absolute irrefutable despair and the titan\u2019s designs were really good. Although I do have to ask, why do they all have to have rape faces? I was told that they were meant to be scary but I only laughed my ass off as I saw them over and over, is this considered bad character design? The Titans always look so ridiculous too\u2026  I don\u2019t really have a favorite character design so I guess I\u2019ll say it was good and shut up about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty good\u2026 Pfft, who am I kidding, just look at them talking while they spiderman over trees! The rest was pretty solid though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits really well with the show\u2019s overall epic and serious atmosphere, excluding the despair of course, but I have to admit that I barely noticed it except for that one soundtrack that has the loud female vocals but I don\u2019t find it to be as good as the others. Despite my words, it is a very good soundtrack. The openings and endings of this anime are so good that I cannot pick my favorite out of all of them. They are that good. They are dramatic and epic and they all fit with the show perfectly, it\u2019s absolutely impossible to choose.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, I was quite surprised when I found out that Mikasa\u2019s voice actress Ishikawa Yui (In the eastern naming order) didn\u2019t have many roles. She did that role so well that I just thought she was a mainstream voice actress but I guess not. She definitely needs more roles.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is definitely an enjoyable show\u2026 Or that\u2019s what I would say but I didn\u2019t enjoy it that much. If I weren\u2019t with my brother watching this and making fun of the fact that we barely knew any character from the show and giving stupid nicknames for them I would\u2019ve dropped it after a while. It might be that action is just not for me but there isn\u2019t that much action so I can\u2019t really give that as an excuse.\\n\\n\r\nIt was definitely the despair. The oh so predictable and oh so annoying despair. The lingering fog of god-awfulness, if that\u2019s even a word. You know when you can always predict that the shounen protagonists will win and everything will be alright? Reverse that and you have the mist. Nothing will be alright but it will end up being solved because the plot has to move on. It was so predictable in that aspect that every time something would happen I would have to go like, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s Attack on Titan after all\u2026\u201d with an apathetic face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAttack on Titan has been considered to be one of the best anime ever but it\u2019s average at best, though it certainly deserves its hype more than the previous hyped show (I\u2019m looking at you SAO\u2026). Its story can hardly stand out due to the awful amount of unnecessary despair getting in the way and it sidetracks into something that wasn\u2019t even fully solved to begin with, though it was very good at luring you in with its premise and strong start. The characters drown in despair, lacking depth and development with the exception of the most important characters and don\u2019t even get me started on Humanity as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and visuals were very good but they couldn\u2019t really carry the show anywhere because of the fog that is despair. My enjoyment was low but I can definitely understand why many would enjoy it. I can definitely expect a second season though and when it happens, I hope everything is solved there. I can recommend this to fans of more serious shounen and action and I guess those that don\u2019t think about details as much as me.",

            "content": "I'd like to get the negatives out of the way first as they were few and had minimal affect on my pleasure experiencing this anime.\r\nThe anime has moments where the action stops, the characters start to have epiphanies. Having epiphanies are not bad, nor is thinking about changing the way they think, act, behave. The problem is doing in the middle of battle. In the middle of battle your teammates, friends, family are continuing to die and struggle, and you also have a higher chance of dying with titans around. Some stand around giving up, and I guess I can see how that is realisticbut my idealism is getting the best of me. When they are making decisions to join military branches, before battle deciding to fight or flee is where these thinking segments are best.\\n\\n\r\nThe three main characters are to extreme (although I can see how it makes it more enjoyable, again minor negative). Yeager, Eren the screamy, head first, if he wasn't a main he would be dead in the first episode. Ackerman, Mikasa the amazing. she is perfect, is exceptional at fighting, supportive, will stand by your side no matter what, strong willed, smart, beautiful. All great things and would make it more believable if she had at least some flaws...when they showed her back story I understood why she became strong willed and became so supportive and protective of Eren but again she is exceptional in combat, is intelligent and they don't show how she came to acquire those things. Eren for example grows to become smarter and stronger by taking up challenges and failing before growing as a person. Arlert, Armin was portrayed as a pathetic character and to extreme in the pathetic range. Thankfully they gave him some love and he is actually a cool character when you get into the show more and more.\\n\\n\r\n I'd like to repeat that these are minor things and I see how having the characters this way would make for a more enjoyable experience and I'm okay with that. The rest of the characters are awesome too, they have quirks and their own personality which makes the anime a good experience.\\n\\n\r\nStory is interesting. Humans are living behind 3 walls, the outermost is Wall Maria; the middle wall is Wall Rose and the innermost is Wall Sina. You want to know why the titans are killing, eating the humans. You want humanity to fight back and win. Every time the episodes end you want to know more. What will happen next? The world created for us is quite large, done well and has plenty of descriptive details. The effort and time put into creating this believable world is what makes the show amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound was beautiful, pleasant to experience.\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime has a very high rewatch value, a pleasurable experience, it drives your curiosity, satisfies your primal side to fight and survive, engages your brain when you see the strategies involved and touches your heart, feeling for the characters when they lose parents, friends, titans or when you see the closeness they begin to form as they grow and fight together. I will be adding this anime to my life library.",

            "content": "Although its good entertainment, Kyojin is far from stellar.\r\nThe story, after a great 1st cour, hits the familiar ceiling that all survival anime inevitably face. The story becomes repetitive, falling into the cycle where the characters run, fight and then reflect on the damage. There was no real plot development or revelations about the titans, and no matter how many characters-I-don't-care-about they killed, I felt indifferent. I felt that this anime tried to dress up weak story arcs and pointless characters with the amazing animation, which was sometimes over the top. There were times when I was sat in awe at the fights, but justas often times when I was thinking \"wtf, he only bit his lip\", or \"wait, he only put a rock back in the wall\". I also felt there were pacing issues in the second cour, with the painfully long expedition resulting in the introduction of new characters and last minute character development with only 1 episode to go!\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I did thoroughly enjoy the 1st cour. From the groundbreaking first episode to the amazing fixing-the-hole sequence in episode 13 (ott but I loved it!), I felt it did a great job at establishing the terrifying power of the titans and raising questions about their origins. I loved how the animators made the titans' movements fast and childlike; it made them grossly realistic and more frightening than if they had just been overwhelmingly huge. The sound was awesome, especially the 1st opening and ending themes that suited the show perfectly! \\n\\n\r\nHopefully the second season will answer the questions the first season failed to answer and no more time will be wasted by Eren's frustrating inability (by his own decision or not) to become a titan when his comrades are dying around him. Id really love to see Kyojin return to focus on the main characters and the mystery of the titans for season 2.",

            "content": "Story : 6\r\nWell, this is my review and i deem it to be as objective as possible, i know every spectator and reviewer of this anime mostly very satisfied of this anime and im like that too.\r\nBut some consider it to be so perfect and exaggerating it like doesnt have any minus at all, yes some already bored and suck with it seeing age of anime turned out to be fapper, maniac, lolicon as anime grow by flooding us with kawaai shoujo, loli, boobs, ass everywhere and im agree too. As shingeki no kyojin bring anime world different aura with tragedy, action oriented anime, butwhile its genre so fresh still it isnt perfect and many can be improved further, to review one anime from objective side, one must compare and inspect it in the same genre area, one anime cant be good simply because its \"unique\" genre among \"mainstream\" genre.\\n\r\nAt first, as many of you can guess im sure, there are many many and many unexplained mysteries left behind. Since this series started with its first episodes until last episodes, question, mystery, my talking in my head grow like exponential curve and there is no explanation till the end. How the fuck is titan created? Who created titan? what for? how the hell are 3 walls created that protects mankind? how suddenly there are 3 walls while mankind under constant attack from the titan? where the hell is eren's father? after this 5 years whats he have been doing? and so much and many more.\\n\r\nAlmost no possibilities for this anime to have its second season makes it worse and all question can be answered from its manga cant answer such damn thing because this is anime review not its manga review, therefore its different thing.\\n\r\nWhile its fulfilling the hunger of action-oriented spectator to their satisfaction, so much best graphic action scene, still it fails to cover overall storyplot become its very very major drawback thus fails to consolidate it into perfect anime.\\n\r\nYes, it is too much action-oriented without good story cover.\\n\r\nWell next, i dont know if this is just me but i think i hate it where only half of the whole series truly gives us fighting-titan scene, where almost the other half contain internal-mankind fight.\\n\r\nOk now at first its telling us \"hey im action-oriented anime\" and next it contains too much internal affair not the breathtaking and ejaculating fighting-titan scene. If im not mistaken, fighting-titan scene bombed at early several episodes and waning toward several last episodes, the only titan in several last episodes mostly just that female-form titan.\\n\r\nBut, really, the most dissapointing point still its lack of story. Really it had twenty five full of episodes dude, you have so many tense and horrific action scene, so many review scene, but cant ended up with even slightest idea to cover many question spectator had in their head.\\n\r\nIn the end, it results as a ridiculous ending, with nothing as conclusion, with so many unanswered remnants. As i watched its last episodes, im like \"WTF, its last episode already? its ending already?\" its like the beginning of the real storyplot and you ended it already.\\n\r\nYou could cover up the whole stories in the last few episodes like Guilty Crown, it wont be long really, or if the manga series still didnt go that far you could made an alternate ending to fill the curiousity, instead you go to high school of the dead plot path where the whole series\\n\r\njust serve us with only early fighting-titan scene and how people depressed from the incident with nothing as solution or history how all happened until the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nWell for full action-oriented anime in medieval era, nothing more can be expected from the art, its magnificent, truly breathtaking fighting scene that makes you ejaculated and the fact that the enemy is monstrous titan with upper hand from mankind always makes you amazed not to forget that 3d manuver geared badass flying over skies everywhere is so stunning.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7\\n\r\nDont wanna tell you, but this is another lack from shingeki. I wonder why i always play Guilty Crown backsound Bios_MK+nZk in my head everytime i see shingeki fighting scene, and i know the reason its because shingeki lacking appropriate backsound and fail to make spectator fully immersed in its scene and sure all op and ed is not..satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8\\n\r\nWell to tell you the truth, i love its 3 protagonist, they are not perfect, they have their own weakness, their own strength, and they are filling each other's gap and hole. At the front, Eren have the biggest sense of judgement, have the biggest willpower, while lacking awareness, exploded and unconscious, and of course dont have the top skills, as standard in almost all male protagonist in every shonen anime. At the right, stand kawai shoujo yet deadly Mikasa and..hard to believe but i guess she is the most inhuman of the 3, average sense of judgement and willpower despite having top-notch skills, and i can say she can oppose the entire world and doesnt give a damn thing which is right as long she can be with Eren :D go go ErenMikasa, everyone know you love Eren so much since childhood until now (that scarf is the proof!!) but unfortunately the series doesnt permit another romance scene :(. And at the left, trustworthy Ermin is the best observer, analyzer and strategist despite having low skills and low willpower but gradually growing as series goes on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8\\n\r\nWith all its weakness and drawback covered with its plus, i enjoyed watching this series so much. Well they said personal enjoyment cant always be related to its objective view.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin is another series that gets a very mixed response. Some claim it has a great story and compelling characters. Others say it has an overly simplified story and characters who are so flat they would almost be at home in Highschool of the Dead. It was written by Isayama Hajime and the anime adaptation was handled by relative newcomer Wit Studio with cooperation from veteran Production I.G, you may recognise them as the studio behind Ghost in the Shell, Rinne no Lagrange and Psycho Pass to name a few. This one I'm actually not going into completely blind. I have read abit of the manga and interacted with some of the fans. I'll try not to hold the fact that many of those fans have trouble with a simple four letter name against the anime. After all, there are plenty of good works with much worse fanbases. Although it certainly doesn't help your credibility when you're trying to argue in favour of the intellectual value of a series but you can't spell \"Levi.\" \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nIn the distant future, mankind has been forced to hide within walls. Gigantic humanoid creatures who seem to live for no other purpose than to consume humans, called titans, roam the land outside. Things get worse when the outermost of the walls is torn down by a titan, allowing the titans to take a third of humanity's remaining territory. The story focuses on three youngsters who witnessed the wall's collapse and managed to survive. They go through military training in order to fight the titans and secure humanity's future. \\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the story is very well constructed. Everything about the world is carefully thought out from the technology to the military formations, even the horses the survey corps rides into battle were carefully selected. There are also a lot of good ideas and suspense building scenes. The story has some great tragic moments and it manages to stop at an opportune time in spite of having a lot more to the story. There are a lot of nice mysteries that keep you invested and the whole thing is very compelling. Particularly the mystery of the titans themselves. The anime itself points out that these creatures should not be able to exist based on basic biology and physics, but they somehow do and, thus far, there are only vague hints and hypotheses as to why. I am interested in seeing more of this world and learning the truth behind the various plot lines. \\n\\n\r\nOn the down side, the pacing is pretty slow, with overly long recap portions contributing to the problem. The series takes nine episodes for one battle. To be fair, it's a battle with multiple enemies and a lot does happen in it, but it's slowed down by fairly long segments where nothing really happens and it probably could have been finished in four or five episodes if they'd skipped the padding. Then, there's the problem with foreshadowing. One of the things the Manga does very well is to give you hints about important story elements well in advance. In the anime, they cut out most of the foreshadowing scenes. There's even one that gets moved so that it's at the beginning of the episode that has the reveal being foreshadowed in it. Which is just terrible narrative construction. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThis is the big factor that people argue about and I can see why. Shingeki no Kyojin mostly has really strong characters, but it also has three incredibly weak ones. Unfortunately, the weak characters are the ones that get the focus for the vast majority of the series. \\n\\n\r\nEren, Mikasa and Armin aren't just mostly boring and occasionally annoying. They're completely clich\u00e9. Eren is your archetypal determined \u201cchosen one\u201d protagonist. Mikasa is your typical \u201cstrong\u201d but emotionally dependent love interest (who just happens to have been raised with Eren since they were nine which adds some disturbing context) and Armin is your basic weak but supportive best friend. He's supposed to be smart, but all he really does is point out the glaringly obvious. The three of them are characters who have been in a huge number of series and there's nothing that Shingeki no Kyojin does to make them unique or interesting in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters, on the other hand, are amazing. When compared to Eren, Mikasa and Armin, especially. The support cast has a lot of complex, well-developed characters. Jean, Connie, Krista, Ymir, Sasha, Erwin, and Levi are the most obvious examples, but there are more. These characters, in spite of having much less screen time, are all interesting with developed motivations and great potential for intrigue . Even the characters who appear very briefly and die are more three-dimensional than the three leads. If the series focused more on the secondary characters and less on Toast, Sand and Oddly-shaped Vegetable, it would be vastly improved. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is gorgeous. The detailing is meticulous. The character designs are all unique. The titans are designed to look almost human, but with enough that's strange about them to make them monstrous, like not having skin or having massive jaws. The backgrounds are really detailed. The action sequences are nice and intense. Everything about this anime looks really spectacular. The only drawback is that the designs are so well detailed that you can easily tell who the colossus, armoured and female titan shifters are at a glance, even if they only reveal one of their identities in the series. The problem being that they try to play their identities up as a big mystery. Gee, I wonder if they're really the people who uncannily resemble them?\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nWit Studio got some really strong actors for this series. There are too many to list all of them, but they got Paku Romi, Kamiya Hiroshi, Ono Daisuke, and Fujita Saki to name a few. They all do really well in their roles. The weaknesses are Kaji Yuki, Ishikawa Yui and Inoue Marina. Just because they got the unfortunate roles as Toast, Sand and Oddly-shaped Vegetable, and all they really get to do is be bland and shout sometimes. The music is really well done. Especially during epic moments. \\n\\n\r\nHo-Yay: \\n\\n\r\nThe Ho-yay factor is a 3/10. Krista and Ymir get a few cute scenes. Erwin and Levi also have some chemistry and Jean implies that Armin has a thing for Eren at one point, but they don't do much with any of that. Perhaps the next series will, but there's not much there in this one. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin offers a compelling narrative with an interesting world, awesome action and some superb characters. Where it falls short is with the pacing and the three primary characters being almost unbelievably bland. Although, in all fairness, they're still too strong of characters to fit into Highschool of the Dead. The series is probably still worth checking out for everything that it does well, if you're a fan of post-apocalyptic or action-oriented narratives. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Going into June my request queue is down to Kill La Kill and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Next week, Sakura Trick. \\n",

            "content": "I think Shingeki no Kyojin is one of those swing and miss types; either you completely love it or you don't.\r\nUnfortunately, for me, I'm leaning towards the latter.\r\nIn terms of its animation, SnK is without a doubt amazingly drawn. The attention to detail is astounding, especially in the action scenes. It's probably the thing I love most about it, because it's just so impressive.\r\nThe plot itself, however, is where I think it falls short.\r\nSnK is one of those shows that could only be described as epic, and not necessarily in a good way. Everything is too high-octane; the deaths, the fights, the dramatic soliloquies. Sometimesyou need a change in tone, and after awhile it just becomes overbearing and tiresome. The characters are very much like that too. They're entirely stagnant, and every time you think they've made some sort of tiny wobble towards development, something tragic happens and sets them right back to where they were before. You're essentially left with the exact same characters in the last episode and the first episode of Season 1, albeit with a few sad stories tucked under their belts.\\n\\n\r\nI really wish I could've loved it, as it had so much potential, but there were just too many issues with the story itself.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What is the most popular anime of 2013? Attack on Titan. Before I started watching, I read so many reviews, heard from my friends and also received so much praise that its one of those \"absolute\" must watch anime of last year. Yes, I did enjoyed it, but to an extent.\r\nThis review will contain spoilers. You've been warned.\r\nHumanity have been overrun by the so called \"Titans\"(to be frank, they are nothing more than just giant, naked zombies) and humans have built huge walls, confining themselves within. Obviously, peace within the city didn't last forever and soon, titans managed to find their way inside. That's thegist of the story. I'll admit that I find AoT's story a bit more unique than the usual, which is a good thing. Ecchi(which is something I hate) which is a very common part of anime these days is nowhere to be found in AoT, and yes, that's another good thing. The initial story seems rather interesting and believable, until one point in the series, it becomes garbage. AoT does have it good and funny moments, even despite it being so serious most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS: One part of the story which I disliked; after the titan-transforming power has been introduced into the anime, it caused the downfall of my own personal viewing experience. While some people called it cool and epic, but its ridiculous in my opinion. Not to mention, even with a crappy explanation to back it up. How did Eren get it? It's nothing more than a dream of Eren being injected by his father. Truthfully, I would have preferred if Attack on Titan story's should have went without all the transforming crap. Though, Annie has it too, and it makes me wonder why is she the only female titan in the anime. But seriously, titan-transforming Power:RUBBISH. Also, I might add that, the outcome behind the Colossal titan and the Armored titan remains unsolved. What happened to them the end of the anime? Amusingly enough, the face of the Colossal titan suddenly appeared at the ending which could mean potential for another season. SPOILER END. \\n\\n\r\nAnother weak aspect of the show, are the characters; namely Eren, Mikasa, Armin. Naruto Uzu- I mean, Eren Yeager is one of those characters out of typical shounen anime: always preaching and talking about exterminating the titans(believe me, you'll hear him repeat it a LOT of times its aggravating). Mikasa could've been a cool character; beautiful, strong, regrettably her main role is like being Eren's babysitter. Lastly, Armin is....well, you know, another Amano Yukiteru clone. The three main protagonists are terrible. They're not the worst protagonists I've seen, but man, I honestly didn't like them. Instead, I was more interested in the supporting characters a little bit more than the main trio(Sasha, Jean, Levi just to name some) but none of them still far enough for a personal favorite. Still, I'll admit that, seeing some of the \"good\" characters die a meaningless death got me quite teary eyed. The characters tend to show realistic reactions during certain situations, though few of them are truly unnecessary and overdone in some cases. \\n\\n\r\nAoT also tries to increase the tension or the \"shock-factor\". Unfortunately, seeing random characters who are nothing but Titan fodder is one of the cheapest ways to do it. By even adding some edgy and shaky camera views and angles, I have to say, they were trying too hard and sometimes the scenes that were SUPPOSED to increase the tension, end up looking bad.\\n\\n\r\nWhat AoT does better at are the music/sound,visuals and the action. They are all...decent at most. First, the action scenes, you can't really go wrong with AoT's action parts. It's does a decent job at getting the viewers' attention to some fast-paced and edge-of-the-seat battles. It still continues to baffle me that the soldiers are able to move fast even carrying all that equipment; the gas cylinders, the three dimensional manuever device, the blades, etc. It just seem difficult. \\n\\n\r\nSound wise, The OP is great (Guren no Yumiya, I've listened to it countless times) and some nice soundtrack kicks in whenever the battle heats up. Voice acting was good, nothing much to say about sound. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall animation quality is good, although from time to time, I find the thick black outlines on the characters quite unappealing. There are several occasions where the characters looked poorly animated and terribly drawn. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I have so many mixed feelings about Attack on Titan. I enjoyed some aspects of it and also hated some parts. It has its fun moments and it does better in other key areas such as sound and animation. But, the characters and several areas of the story ruined it for me. Dedicated action fans would definitely love AoT. Still, I truly can't recommend AoT for the serious viewer. If there ever be a second season, I don't mind watching it.\\n",

            "content": "OKAY!!! SO, finally finished the series.\r\nImpressions: Great Entry Level Anime that appeals universally to pretty much anyone and everyone. \r\nStory began with the first two episodes giving me high expectations. For me, this was one of the strongest beginnings to an anime since Gurren Lagann. Eren was perfectly set up to be the archetypal Beowolf Character. A hero who trips and falls, but finally finds victory in the end. What they did that was clever was they separated the hero archetype into three different characters instead of shoving all of the traits into one. \r\nEren = Force of Will\r\nArmin= Intelligence\r\nMikasa = Skill/Talent\r\nDid the storylive up to expectations? No. \\n\r\nIt actually did not live up to expectations and although i hate to use this excuse, it is precisely because it is marketed as Shounen Manga. This undermines a lot of the powerful imagery and symbolism that could've been there.  In the end they're wading in a bunch of shoulda coulda but yah didn'ts. \\n\\n\r\nArt is fantastic, and shows one of the best usages of CGI since Fate Zero. Lines are still a bit too sharp for me, but its still great regardless. Very detailed although i can see they re-used stock footage occasionally. \\n\\n\r\nSound is your \"AAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH\" Choir on top of heavy action scenes that we've become accustomed to... and you know what? STILL FUCKING AWESOME. Great timing here on choosing when to play what music. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are weaker than i would've liked them to be. They might've been going for the \"anyone is expendable\" route, but if they were.... they wouldn't have FUCKING DONE WHAT THEY DID TO EREN I MEAN WHAT THE FLYING FU---  *cough* i'm okay >_< Lets just say Eren pulls a Jesus, with the most bullshit retarded excuse for a plot device ever. You'll enjoy the characters, but they won't stand out outside of their established character archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is incredible in this anime. At the end of the day, its a shonen show, and it does what shonen shows do best. Scream loudly, and make things explode..... in the span of 10 episodes. BUT CONDENSED INTO 1! What a novel idea ;) \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show does exactly what it's supposed to, and doesn't really push any innovation besides production value to the table. I expected far more, but sadly this shant be the show to deliver. If you like action and a good enough plot to keep you invested, by all means, this show does wonders for you.",

            "content": "\"People DIE when they are killed!\"\r\nOr so I thought until several episodes into this show when it becomes apparent that this might not be exactly accurate..  Attack on Titan pulled me in the instant I started watching it.  I had very high hopes and truly wanted to enjoy this show.\r\nArt - 8\r\nThis show is highlighted by a lot of very good art.  The characters all have their own looks and the backgrounds are all fleshed out and are actually very gorgeous.  The 3D maneuver gear scenes alone are worth 2 extra points, as they are spectacular, especially early on.  Theonly downfall is that the art is very inconsistent.  It will be glamorous one second and then it will be ok for several scenes, sometimes even falling below the ok mark.  The desperation that they try to paint on every character's face is very unrealistic, especially the bigots that are against the main cast because of their desperation or fear.  They look more constipated than anything else.  The art is definitely the highlight of the show, but it can definitely falter at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nAside from the openings, I honestly can't recall much of the music from the show.  It honestly left no impression on me whatsoever.  The only exception being the music when Eren transforms.  The voice acting was for the most part above average, and made me believe most of the characterizations.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5\\n\r\nAttack on Titan was full of untapped potential.  It hit on so many amazing notes, but then failed to follow through in even the most basic of ways.  I won't be one of those guys to say there are plotholes throughout, but I will say that a lot of the story simply does not make any sense.  What the characters do doesn't make any more sense.  Are we supposed to believe that a little kid  can track down criminals and kill them without any training or reason/prior hatred for criminals?  And why can't we have a series where the main character dies for once?  it might have been a decent change of pace, if done correctly....speaking of pace, this story has none.  I feel like I'm watching Katekyo Hitman Reborn all over again.  By the second to last episode of the last arc, I honestly didn't care anymore, they had drawn it out to such an extreme extent.  The first several episodes were fast paced and even had a time jump, then we get a drawn out five or more episode single day!!??  Why in the world could they have not given any kind of conclusion to any of the story whatsoever?  There are like fifty unanswered questions, most of which are quite obvious to deduce in your sleep, there are so many cliches in the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's go into what Attack on Titan really is.  What Attack on Titan really is, is a zombie/godzilla crossbreed.  No one is safe aside from the main characters who will 'barely survive'  then find a way to burn all the eggs, or find a cure, and send godzilla....the zombies....I mean the titans into hybernation or something like that.  We even have the infection ideas, if no one picked up on the vomit eggs they pointed out in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3\\n\r\nEren - Annoying, Ichigo from Bleach, but more immature and less understanding, character.  I actually liked Eren after his character \"DEVELOPMENT\", if you can call it that.  Oh I got older so now I don't flip out at the drop of a hat.  That's my development, but that's as far as it goes.\\n\\n\r\nMe and my two friends are masters of the extremely hard to master 3D gear, as soon as we touch it.  My girlfriend for whom I don't share feelings for, has unstoppable potential and loves me for convincing her to take another person's life when she was a child.  My best friend likes to read books and is really nerdy meaning that he has the ability to command a losing battle into a winning one cause his book reading made him that tactically superior over the dozens of experienced tacticians on hand at any moment.\\n\\n\r\nWish fulfillment anyone?  Mary and Gary Sue exist and they're having incest all over your dumb hopes and dreams of this being the best show ever.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters have no development other than to state what their stereotype is.  The ONLY exception being what's his face...the only guy who gets much screen time and whose friend is killed making him want to be a leader cause his friend always said he would be...that guy.  But they don't DO anything with it.  They just show him more often than any of the other side cast.  Even the AMAZING Petra didn't get a quarter his screen time....for that matter why is everyone so hyped up about Petra?  She had no development and was more friendship oriented than a 5 year old Naruto. (and yes I realize Naruto had no friends when he was 5 years old...it's part of my point)  All she really does is whine about the main character not believing in them enough...over...and over...and over again.  Sure it's a little  sad about her family, but other than that I don't get the huge travesty that was, when we had literally no time to grow to love her.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is pretty decent, but is overhyped to such an extreme I want to shout SAO, Naruto, One Peice, Bleach, etc. over and over and over again till people start pulling their heads out of their anuses.\\n\\n\r\nI give this show a 6/10",

            "content": "Okay I am a fan of some giant comics and films.  I was disappointed when i saw this series.  I take a look at things from episode 1.  If its not interesting at that first episode the anime show is not good.  This anime show went beyond that.  It was boring, and i seriously wanted to smack myself for wasting 20 minutes even scanning through this.  The plot to this show is also rediculous, and the characters within the show do some of the most idiotic things imaginable.  Like building a city and staying in it for 100years, and not preparing for things incase it does happen.  No they panic instead of being prepared for war, and do things too late.  Anyways also for this show to be \"gory,\" and \"graphica\"l it sure as hell takes too long to kill someone.  Seriously it takes 20 minutes for a giant monster to kill a human being.  Seriously the show would have been good, had it not started off with some of the most dumbest things imagineable.  On top of it all it spends too much of its time talking.  This is like watching those boring marvel movies, and people consider this nonsense epic or badass.  For a giant show, you would expect atleast human bodies or a darker setting, but you just get this boring plot which i am more bored than scared.  This is coming from a guy who loves the giant films.  Giant females as well which the show seemed to lack, but once they include her into the series, and while reading the manga because i cannot take looking at 20 minutes boring, they made the whole series into a big joke.  I kid you not i am changing my view of things about this anime now, because of the giant woman being introduced.  And this is a shame, how she can come in and make the manga literally funny, but the show a complete mess and waste of time that you can use to watch something else.  I seriously recommend the manga vs the anime.  The anime is a complete waste, while the manga is just funny as hell and interesting.  Its just a shame the woman acts more like a giant would in these fanmade comics, vs how a male giant would act lol.  This also proves once again, how manga will always defeat anime.  Not because of how anime always censors somethings, but because you get more content in a stand still comic vs a moving motion picture.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nIs Attack on Titan the greatest thing since sliced bread or a really over hyped series that will be forgotten in a few years? Your opinion on Attack on Titan will of course vary in accordance with your personal aesthetics, but lets take a closer look at this unquestionably popular titan of a hit!\r\nStory 4:10\r\nHumanity is minding its own business when suddenly a plague of mentally retarded giants start killing everyone. Giant: (drools and stares vacantly) \"DEEEER Herp derp Chomp!\" This is the middle ages so we really don't have the technology to fight these drooling, stumbling, special needs behemoths. However, we somehow find thetime to build walls several hundred feet tall while the titans are relentlessly slaughtering us. How did we build such massive walls in the middle ages with such primitive tech? How did we get massive amount of requisite time? Will this ever be explained? Maybe in another 200 episodes, but I wouldn't get your hopes up. This story is the classic post apocalyptic zombie survival tale except with zombies replaced with retarded giants. In a zombie movie it rarely matters how the zombie plague came into being. What matters is the frantic struggle to survive following the plague. The first episode starts out with an emotional bang, but what follows are boring training montages that we have seen a million times before and the building up of pointless characters that we all know are mostly going to die quickly and without purpose. I will avoid any major spoilers, but there are some big plot twists that seem...questionable. If you are one of the masses that simply love zombie survival horror, this one is right up your alley. If you didn't think Walking Dead was the greatest show of the last 20 years, this story will simply not knock your socks off.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Eren Jaeger (German for hunter) who hunts titans and is obsessed with vengeance at all costs. He is a stock character that we have all seen 1,000 times before. The man so consumed with vengeance that he abandons decency and becomes a monster himself. This was done better in Hellsing Ultimate with the far more amusing Alexander Anderson. There are other characters like badass action chicks Mikasa and Annie as well as the whiny twerp Armin Alert. Yes, they really named a character Armin Alert as in Armed and Alert. That pun is so bad I almost smashed my palm right through my frontal bone. The characters are decent, but really nothing memorably great. I frankly find their popularity to be confounding.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs you would rightfully expect from a new anime with a titanic budget, Attack on Titan looks good. It looks very good. The art is one of the biggest highlights of the series and makes the action scenes a genuine joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan is well renowned for its spectacular soundtrack. Although it isn't my absolute personal favorite, it is in fact very good. The 1st opening theme was amazing and the background music is well done throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nTo dive back into the 90s and quote Austin Powers, \"This just aint by bag baby\". I have never liked the zombie survival genre and changing the zombies to retarded giants doesn't really do anything for me. Is it a metaphor for the numerically huge but allegedly stupid and brutish Chinese threatening Japan? That is what many Chinese viewers felt, but I honestly don't think the mangaka had any political allegory in mind. I think it honestly just is what it is. Not everyone is going to share my opinion, so you may really enjoy Attack on Titan. It is all a matter of taste.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series has amazing art, great music, and tries really hard to cash in on the zombie survival craze that has swept the world over the last decade like a global epidemic. It hit the right note at precisely the right time and for that I take my hat off to it from a financial perspective. This was an absolutely brilliant work of marketing and giving the masses exactly what they want. Is it the greatest anime ever? I sure as hell didn't think so, but if you like that kind of thing, more power to you. It takes all types to make a village.",

            "content": "If you have no idea what this anime is about... Go read the synopsis.\r\nStory:\r\nBasically, It's about a guy, Eren, who essentially doesn't have parents, and a girl, Mikasa, and another guy, Armin, who happen to be childhood friends with Eren.\r\nEren loses his mother, when Titans invade, and she... basically gets eaten.\r\nWell then... In this anime, they rely on that idea so much. They rely on how \"disturbing\" that idea may be in order to keep people\" interested\", but to those who don't find it interesting will get bored very quickly.\r\nSkip over to the whole accusation that Eren is a complete monster.\r\nThis, in my opinion wasan absolutely horrid... arc? Anyways, they decide to spend multiple episodes on it, and in the middle of it pull out the episode 13.5... Yay... a recap.\\n\r\nAnyways, In terms of the story, the producers and such decide to move very slow, as if this were an anime like Naruto, or something else that is very long, but this is a 25 episode series.. Very little happens per episode, and they have a recap at the beginning of each episode that lasts about 2 minutes, yet they decided to make a recap episode (13.5)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is actually really good. It's actually really interesting how they portray characters as if they're from different regions of the world. The way Eren's titan form looks is absolutely amazing. The same goes for the backgrounds and the smaller details.\\n\r\nAlthough this may be true, a lot of the anime is a slideshow, which can be boring at times so.. yeah... There really isn't much to comment on.\\n\r\nThe art is good, some little gripes, but nothing major.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is also pretty good, as they decide to go with epic music... I really don't know how to describe it more... It just adds to the somewhat, old times, feel of the anime. Some of the music is pretty bad, in my opinion though, such as the openings.\\n\r\nThe reason why I rated the sound an 8, is because I never felt it REALLY added to the whole experience all that much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are alright. The main characters are pretty bland. Angsty teenager, girl who likes said teenager, childhood friend. That's basically it.\\n\r\nHowever, the side characters seem to be much more interesting, as they have their own quirks, and seem to have a lot of thought put into them.\\n\r\nThat's basically why I gave it a 7/10 here. The main characters, which should honestly be the most interesting, are not. Right now, my favorite character is Levi, and he only got properly introduces a couple of episodes ago.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I said before, the anime moves very very slow, and has a recap of the past episodes every episode. Doing this cuts the episode time down to about 20 minutes. I feel if anything, they should be cramming more stuff in each episode. Instead, the anime goes at a ridiculously slow pace. One episode was literally just people talking/arguing the whole time. Then they decide to pull out the episode 13.5 which was a recap, which honestly wasn't needed at all. Overall, it seems like the people working on this can't keep up with the pace that's expected by people like me. The only reason why I expect more is because I compared the enjoyment to other anime of the same number, or more, episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'll try keeping this one short.\\n\r\nIt's pretty boring after the 4th episode or so. All their effort is honestly going into the wrong places. The story progresses very little per episode, that it makes it hard to believe that it's a 25 episode series. The art and sound are good, but nothing super exceptional. The characters are alright. The main characters are quite boring, but the side characters make up for that.\\n\r\nIt just moves so slow, that all their effort doesn't come through. It's not eventful, and there's very little, if any moments where I'd get so excited that I'd jump around or slam my desk.",

            "content": "Everything about this series is love or hate. Many believes how great and fascinating this series is, but how about the flaws many die-hard fans ignore?  \r\nTo put it simply, some adapt to the world of Shingeki no Kyojin and screams \"best animu evarrr\" while others try to dissect the plot, and find it is a version of the likes of Claymore, or a different version of a scary zombie apocalypse. \r\nStory: after almost facing extinction, humanity escapes to three layers of sturdy wall, saving the last of themselves from their predator, Titans. And after 107 years of this \"peace\", the walls are breachedagain, where our protagonist loses his mother and swears for revenge on the Titans, as he escapes to the second layer of the three wall. Then, the story starts and the journey to killing titans begins. However, as he progresses, he finds the terrible truth and starts uncovering mysteries of his world.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps many people, when they encounter some absurd ideas, think \"it's stupid\" or \"how did they do that, it's stupid\". To you all of that kind, everything in this series is part of a dark truth. \\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin's story isn't as original as  screamers think, as Claymore also had the idea of humans living in the fear of superior beings, fighting monsters with monsters and a world with dark secrets and conspiracies ages ago. However, one may view Shingeki no Kyojin as a much more intense Claymore, female knights replaced with teen soldiers and gut-eating monsters replaced with giant man-eating human-like creatures called \"Titan\" or \"Kyojin\", and walled . I can go on about how the two are similar, but I think I have showed that the idea nor the story is original as many claims. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the author knows his world well, too well, and the plot follows very well stitched. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: again, a love-hate topic. Many finds the protagonist Eren as cry-baby, way too loud, idiotic, too hyper, and too set on revenge. Eren Jaegar is exactly like that. However, anyone who understands the feeling of seeing family members ripped apart in front of their eyes will instantly ignore these qualities Eren has and accept that his actions are natural, which it is.\\n\\n\r\nMikasa, or \"Eren-fangirl\" or \"emotionless girl\" or \"weird one\". That is the shortest description and a fitting one for our main female lead. Her circumstances are udnerstandable, again, given her past. \\n\\n\r\nArmin or \"intelligent one\" or \"biggrst cry-baby\" \\n\\n\r\nAside from the three main protagonist, supporting characters are very well done. Some are realistic such as Jean, some are weird (Hanji), some are mysterious (Annie) and some are always yelling, some are clever (Irwin) and many who will make brief appearance and then die. There are others who I didn't mention. \\n\\n\r\nArt: a VERY unique art. Yes, you either love ot or hate it. The character designs are reputable, 3D manuevar gear deisgn is excellent and well though out (don't comapre it to reality or if it is possible)..and then Titans. Yes, titans are portrayed as sloppy,  and their proportions are varying, they are always naked (don't worry, no fanservice intended, they just lack reproductive organs). \\n\r\nBUT, the borders, or outlines are very bold, sometimes it is rather uncomfortable. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fluid, good. However, endless recaps, flash-backs, scenes lacking backgorunds. Battle scenes are done well. The opening animations are phenomenal, where as endings are just typically animayed. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: Boths openings are from Link Horizon, Japanese mixed with German. One sounds like revenge and action, and another one is encouraging anthem-like song. If the opening's job was to buy views and summarize the anime, it did extremely well. Soundtracks behind the scenes are decent. They do lift the mood, but, sometimes are non-fitting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: very enjoyable for me, personally. If you understand and are willing to adapt your veiws, you will scream \"besto animu\". However, recaps, flashbacks, some semi-annoying characters, and very bold outlines....well not so enjoyable now I think logically. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: an exmaple where anime fans wil divide and argue. While the intense, entertaining non-original plot are reputable, the flaws are there. You may or may not choose to ignore it.\\n\r\nBut in the end, it isn't disappointing, but not satisfying either. It is so similar to Claymore that I couldn't help but compare them.",

            "content": "In order to achieve something, we must make a sacrifice. For pride, dignity, honour and glory.\r\nSince I mentioned that I wasn't planning on watching \"Attack on Titans\" on my previous \"High School of the Dead\" review. I take those words back now. I just can't believe most youtube videos make parody out of this anime and I wonder what is all the commotion about.\r\nSTORY (7):\r\nOMG! It's Godzilla! Just Joking! The story takes place in a village which is surrounded by 3 walls that protect the village. From outside to inside, Wall Maria, Wall Rose & Wall Sina. These walls are served as a fortress fordefense against attacks. Things start to turn nasty when the titans break the walls down and devour humans. This gives rise to the challenge within the military. \\n\\n\r\nSo basically the story starts off as slow with some fillers as the military troops fight the titans and slowly have some flashbacks. Things start to turn interesting on Eren's trial and when the female titan shows up. There is basically nothing special about the story. Just like most action anime, the last few episodes are the most interesting part of the anime. At the end, when they reveal a titan image on the wall, I was so surprised.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION (8):\\n\\n\r\nTetsuro Araki directed \"High School of the Dead\" which has a similar colour tone this anime has. The color tone is as dark as the anime \"High School of the Dead\". The difference is that Attack on Titans has an outline which is bold. The titans are like giant humans or zombies. Tetsuro Araki came up with a very creative idea on making giants and zombies in anime. Outlines that are bold resembles a dark and serious tone.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also made use a lot of references like Spiderman when they swing the rope. Even like during the final battle, this anime made use the reference of Red Hulk like when the Titan was angry and powerful, the titan starts to heat up.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9):\\n\\n\r\nNow I understand why there was a lot of hype for this anime. The opening \"Guren no Yumiya\" was frequently used in most youtube videos that I have watched and they name it \"Shingeki no xxxxx\". Even few youtube videos used the 2nd opening \"Wings of Freedom\". I liked the 1st opening \"Guren no Yumiya\". The 1st and 2nd opening has tunes that resembles pride and dignity as a soldier. The 1st and 2nd ending was ok.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (6):\\n\\n\r\nThere is really not so much character development in most of the cast. The main characters Eren, Mikasa and Armin had little character development.\\n\\n\r\nEren was brave but however he sometimes act rashly and ended up screwing his life and people around him.\\n\\n\r\nMikasa didn't surprise me at first because I thought she would be useless but in this anime she was smart, badass, calm and composed. I appreciate her development as a character.\\n\\n\r\nArmin had wits but he wasn't capable in combat. He sometimes might lose faith when things go wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSo, basically Eren & Armin are the ones that overreact the most. But at least they went through a bit of development and they show courage and spirit.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that went through a great character development are one of the supporting characters. They are Erwin, Jean, Levi & Marco. Levi is my most favorite character in this anime because without him, I wouldn't be enjoying this anime as much as most of the fans of this show did. \\n\\n\r\nLevi was the most badass character in this anime. He is smart, calm and caring on the inside, even though on the outside, he is cold and strict. He is now one of my favorite characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (8):\\n\\n\r\nEren is one good example to learn that if you act rashly, you will end up destroying yourself and everyone around you. When someone gives an opinion about Eren, he gets easily angry and shouts. Just like most people, they tend to act rashly and cause harm to others even themselves. A good lesson to learn is that when we make decisions, we must do a self-reflection and think about the consequences. Because decisions can have benefits and consequences as well.\\n\\n\r\nMost fans of this show rate either a 9 or 10. But if I rate this show a 9 or 10 which means this anime has surprised me to the point where I go defenseless. I will put my heart and soul into this anime if I rate this anime a 9 or 10. However, I wasn't surprised about this anime at all. I never say \"OMG! This is the best anime ever!\" I appreciate Tetsuro Araki's effort in coming up with this anime that is based on giants attacking cities and humans which is a new concept. However, based on my grading, I was not surprised at all. I have seen this in most action anime nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also says that in order to achieve victory, you have to sacrifice your joy. It follows the quote \"No pain, no gain\". Just like in life, we have to sacrifice our happiness for the benefit of the world.\\n\\n\r\nNow, fans of this show, please consider my thoughts carefully before you click the \"Helpful\" or \" Not Helpful\". I am trying to create a lesson which we can learn from. Anime not only gives enjoyment but it also gives a good lesson which we can take back from. If you love this show, good for you.\\n\\n\r\nNow, before I close. If you want to know why Eren's trial is exciting to watch, you click on the link that I have posted below \"Reason I watch Attack on Titans\".\\n\\n\r\nI will give it a 8 out of 10. It was worth the watch and you should definitely check this out.\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to tell me what you think about \"Attack on Titans\".",

            "content": "i believe attack on titan to be the best anime of all time. It has great characters, has no cliches, an intelligent plot, and a brutal setting that doesn't conform to the typical \"characters always win, friendship\" because anyone can die in attack on titan.\r\nthe characters in this anime go through very intense psychological trauma, stripping away their personalities turning them into some brutes with development that leaves the viewer very sympathetic and at the same time terrified. eren is an intensely emotional main character who's life has been devastated by the titans and has a seemingly futile quest for revenge that threatens to endangerthe lives of his friends mikasa and armin. mikasa is possibly even more broken than eren, after certain circumstances she has come to view eren as her only hold on humanity, and seeks to protect him. armin of course is very empathic as well, and reacts to the situations he's placed into like a real kid would; but still manages to find courage within himself, a great character.\\n\\n\r\nthe side cast is amazing as well, with memorable and awesome characters like levi and hanji zoe\\n\\n\r\nthe story is brilliant, juggling military campaigns and the survival of those within the walls with the mystery of the titans, i can't say much more with spoiling things.\\n\\n\r\nmusic is exceptional and quite outstanding, providing adrenaline rush to already spectacular action scenes.\\n\\n\r\noverall attack on titan is my personal favorite anime for it's sheer entertainment value and not so shabby story and charactes, i highly reccomend this show to everybody.",

            "content": "Okay. I don't know where to start.\r\nShingeki no Kyojin has got to be one of the most influential, profound, breathtaking study of humanity to be found yet.\r\nWhat would happen if a group of people were locked up in a restrained place and were forced to face an enemy that was immortal, ten times as big as them, and, worse even, who LOOKED like them? What would happen then, if, after over a century of oppression and constant terror, humanity was given a hope, a single, final hope, in the form of that very mortal enemy?\r\nHow do humans react when given a hope that they can'tbelieve in? How do mothers react when their children's only possibility for pride, and close to the only future they have, is to go off and die for a cause which is believed to have long been lost? How do children react when their families have been taken from them, and when they do not have in their hands the instruments of revenge...?\\n\\n\r\nHumanity is helpless. Danger did not make it come together; it divided it. Humans cannot win without deaths, and humans cannot win if they remain human - in every sense of the term. What has their world come to?\\n\\n\r\nI have no idea what possessed me to watch this anime. But I do know what kept me coming for more - though I'm not entirely sure if I can put it into words.\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin is not just an anime about the woes and hoes of humanity. It is a metaphorical study of the caged beast. A study, in which humanity has become the beast, and the beast has become the captor.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \u221d/10. Everything has been said.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \u221d/10. The graphics had me breathless. The fluidity and impressions given by the 3D Manoeuver Gear in particular are absolutely mesmerizing. I felt like I was flying, and it had me dreaming in wonder. Extensive and diverse character designs, coupled with breathtaking landscapes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \u221d/10. Guren no Yumiya has got to be one of the best anime openings seen to this day. The sound effects in the anime were also halting, and the voice actors are exceptionally good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \u221d/10. Isayama Hajime did an outstanding job in creating his characters. Standing out are Eren Jaeger, the protagonist; Mikasa Ackerman, the genius sidekick; and Levi Ackerman, the savior of humanity.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Infinity doesn't begin to cover it. To me, it was life-changing. I could not get enough.\\n\\n\r\nOveral: Since 10 here is the maximum rating allowed, I'll settle for that; but it does not do justice to the awesomeness that is Shingeki no Kyojin.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could write more, but every time I talk about Shingeki no Kyojin I get totally overwhelmed.\\n\\n\r\nA masterpiece of the kind, and of all kinds to come.",

            "content": "Today I finished watching one of the most famous and acclaimed series of recent times. Before starting, I wondered if it deserves all this fame. And the conclusion I came to was: No, although it's good, is not that great.\r\nShingeki no Kyojin is, in short, \"a display of epic action with exceptional animation and soundtrack to his height\". It has been described in many ways: The Best series of 2013, The Best in the present, A \"Before and after\" in the world of anime \u00bfbut seriously is all this ? Honestly, no. Aside from that I mentioned above, has nothing else going for\r\nLet us beginby mentioning the good: for a series of action it is important that... action scenes are good, with good animation and an OST to give that feeling of \"epicness\" Shingeki no Kyojin complies with that, especially with the OST that I admit, is one of the best OST I've heard today. Still, there were relatively few action scenes for what I thought it would be (and what made me believe with so much spam when it was airing). The rest is, the \"not so good\" in the series\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe history with the Titans and the humanity in oppression is somewhat interesting, the way in which the humanity has managed to survive gives for much. But only that, although the anime handles well, not delve into details that, along, become important. There are times where it wants to take itself so seriously that is bored and disappointing, even to me, who really enjoy series of \"much blablabla and little action\" as Monogatari Series or Log Horizon. Among other things, the theme of \"humans don't have a chance against the Titans\" is annoying, especially when they want to put in each chapter.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother point to be discussed are the characters. No matter how good is the story, if  there are not characters that appeal, it is useless. Really are few the characters who can say that they are worth:\\n\\n\r\n-Eren as protagonist starts out decent, and is appreciated he has Balls and is decided, but that of \"I want to kill'em all!!\" seems more the whim of a child that a personal goal, aside after the second half of the anime, he goes from being a warrior to the Lady in Trouble who has to be protected and then saved. And personally, he made me understand why much people hate Yuuki Kaji as a seiyuu...\\n\\n\r\n-Mikasa... She's strong, intelligent and bold \u00bfwhat's the problem? She really has no personal goal, evolution as a character, nothing. Just walk behind Eren to \"protect\" him... What a waste of potential\\n\\n\r\n-Armin is perhaps (no, actually he is) the best character by far. Yes, the weakling who can't kill a Titan by his own is better than the rest, simply because he was the only one who showed a good development, and of the few to use his head before the Maneuver Sistem. Whenever he spoke, he said something good, enough to keep me interested in the facts. His speech in chapter 10 was the best I saw in the series until then\\n\\n\r\n-Levi stood out as a great warrior and have that air of mystery around him. It had so much potential, but his little participation prevented that he developed better\\n\\n\r\n-There were other characters like Jean (one that had good performance) and Hanji (this is something more personal, just liked her crazy personality xD) also stand out a bit, but nothing really relevant.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Shingeki no Kyojin is one of the most outstanding series at the time, although as has pretty good stuff, has other where it fails miserably. Much people turn a blind eye to these failures and there comes the exaggerated treatment they have to it. \u00bfIt was a good serie? Yes \u00bfThe Best of 2013 and in the present? By far... No \u00bfOverrated? Maybe...",

            "content": "Attack on Titan is a series that is held in very high regard by the majority of the anime community, thus I found it a little strange how I struggled to finish the series for so long. This series  found itself fluctuating between my on hold and watch list, and for quite a while it found itself on my back burner due to its quite abysmal pacing through its first half and the large amount of one dimensional characters. However the series truly does shine during its very well done action sequences and how it is able to create an interesting world. There willbe some spoilers in this review.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Attack on Titan is fueled by a lust for revenge by our main character, Eren Jaeger who wishes to kill all the Titans. This is his defining trait, and drives him to eventually enlist in the military and join the Recon Corps. I wish I could say that is character is fleshed out more as the story goes on, but he is mostly driven by his desires for justice and revenge and sees little developmental change from the start to beginning. The story creates an excellent atmosphere of hopelessness right from the beginning, and is well done through the savage depictions of violence by the Titans and the twisted horror that is often seen on the faces of characters as they attempt to fight in vain or survey the death and destruction around them. The narrative then shifts introducing us to an ensemble cast of characters and focuses on their training as they attempt to join the most prestigious ranks of the military. \\n\r\nAlmost all of the characters can be summed up with one quick sentence, such as Mikasa who, really likes Eren and is one of the top recruits, she is able to cut down Titans with ease. Her fondness of Eren is her only defining trait, it is the reason behind almost all her actions and in fact her screaming \"Eren!\" could be argued to make up a healthy amount of her lines. Armin is the physically weak but smart kid who comes up with the majority of plans that the group uses, and befriended Eren because he used to stick up for him when he was bullied. Almost all the characters are fairly one dimensional, except for Jean one of my favorite characters from the show who goes through a fairly significant change in his outlook as the show goes on. I also wanted to learn a lot more about Annie and her motives, finding her to be an extremely interesting character to watch, especially as the show continues on.\\n\r\nThe story progresses very slowly, the battles are stretched out over several episodes and are sometimes inter-cut with a lot more dialogue than necessary. This sometimes makes the series really feel like it's dragging on, and the reason I had trouble watching the show. It felt the battle of Trost was simply never going to end, despite the fact that there were a lot of interesting developments and some excellent battle scenes, as well as a great veil of despair and hopelessness that surrounded the human's as they fought the Titans. This leads to one of my biggest problems I had watching the series, the fact that Eren has the ability to turn into a Titan. This negated the air of despair that the series had so intricately crafted and gave our main hero a super powerful form that instantly turned the tide of the battle. Also when we watch series there is a degree of believability that we all have, and I found it difficult to believe that even in the fantasy world of AoT, Eren could turn into a hulking giant simply by biting his thumb. I would have much rather have seen Eren and humanity struggle and fight against these unstoppable foes rather than gain such a game-changing ability. \\n\\n\r\nI found that the second half of the series solved some of the pacing problems of the first with the introduction of the mysterious female Titan, seeing such a powerful enemy and the vain attempts to take it down drove the feeling of desperation that humanity is feeling. Having a set goal in the second half helped drive the narrative forward and it was highlighted by some great action scenes, as well as some well though out plans that are able to be triggered. The death and destruction that humanity faces is once again brought front and center, and is what makes the series so interesting as humanity faces a clearly superior foe. The series really hits its stride when it shows the psychological as well as the physical effects that the Titans have on the population, and crafts an interesting that leaves you wondering about the Titans, the walls, and makes you questions if humanity will be able to overcome its slow extinction. Attack on Titan sports some top notch action this is only amplified by its haunting soundtrack, and sets up an excellent atmosphere and world for the viewer to enjoy. However it is bogged down by slow pacing and a large cast of one dimensional characters, which isn't always a bad thing, but I expected to see much more significant development with the main cast. Overall the series is an intriguing one that is highlighted by some fantastic action, but will try your patience as the narrative crawls along.",

I just want to jot down my thoughts on somewhere where I physically can't lose it)\r\n\u2661\r\nFirst things first, holy shit the art is so amazing and meticulous I have absolutely no words for how well the animators and artists did aHhhhh.\r\nOkay, so, I'm sure like 99% of the anime fandom has seen Attack on Titan, otherwise known as Shingeki no Kyojin. The story, season one anyway, follows the life (sort of) of Eren Yeager who, by the way, has like the most beautifuleyes on the face of the planet, along with his two friends Mikasa and Armin.\\n\r\nYou're introduced to these three characters first and a bunch others in the long run, all of whom you should not get too attached to for even a second.\\n\r\nLike Akame ga Kill!, this anime will like ruin you and your ability to trust so don't get a t t a c h e d.\\n\r\nOkay, for real though, the story itself is purely unique and takes place in a dystopian society where, in a nutshell, the fittest survive. There's like a complex living structure and stuff that's mapped out by the government but you can find that out after you start the series.\\n\r\nThe art, like I said, is simply gorgeous and very detailed. Not a single one of the characters look the same, unless you count some of the corpses (hahaa..... too soon?). The soundtrack, aka the opening, closing and ost are all a wonderful listen. The opening was actually my phone's ringtone for a while- LOL.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series and enjoyed watching a genuine character development throughout the anime, which was accompanied by a fast, yet steady story progression. I think that, if you can stomach the gore, Shingeki no Kyojin is a fantastic watch that everyone should consider watching.\\n\r\nJust...don't have a light stomach!",

            "content": "I wouldn't call myself an enthusiast of action/drama series, however, I thoroughly enjoyed the anime. The anime mesmerizes its audience with fascinating action sequences and with captivating story telling.\r\nStory :( Please read the synopsis before reading any further).The setting of the story is quite intriguing in its own way. Set several hundreds of years ago, human race is endangered by titans, who are several meters high and eat humans. Humans are protected by three huge walls namely-Wall Maria, Wall Rose, Wall Sina. The progress of the story with every episode is the asset of the entire series. The series contain no filler episodes, while beingserious till the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is absolutely outstanding and precise. It is the forte of the entire anime series. It sets ablaze the already radiant action in the series. I found the art one of the best in recent years maybe due to the fact that this anime actually uses it accurately as none other recently.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Supported by an astounding opening theme and the sound track is, maybe second to none in my opinion. The background score for the fights might actually be the selling point of the series, while marking its importance alongside art in the anime. This combined with pace make unique and entertaining clash between humans and titans.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in the series are quite orthodox. The main protagonist: Eren Yeager is driven by rage acquired due to his past. He, while having spirit lacks talent. Other main characters in the story are his friends Mikasa and Armin. Armin lacks power and courage, compensating in intelligence. He sits back in fear while the other two move forward. Mikasa is both talented and hard working. She has a dark past and is attached to Eren, tries to save him whenever possible. While the story progresses we are introduced to various characters. While the most noted among them is Levi. He receives a \"superman\" entrance. He is mostly silent oozing brilliance throughout his presence in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I found the series profoundly enjoyable for a wide range of audience.\\n\\n\r\nSupported by outstanding sound and art, being accurately paced and possessing best action sequences, in my opinion is one of the best in its genre\\n",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin a.k.a. Attack on Titan is one of those rare anime that grabs everyone's attention straight from the get go by being completely fucking crazy. From the very first episode it delivers the message that this series isn't really like any other, and that on a very large scale. Publically known as the best anime of 2013, a statement that might arguably be justified, however it's still not completely flawless.\r\nStory - 9/10:\r\nHonestly this is somewhat hard to rate given that this is merely the first season and the storyline is hence very much so unfinished, but from what there is thus far, Ican say that it is fairly predictable as to many of its unfolding events.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said you can mostly forgive that part, as the actual presentation is very good. Because of the sheer scale of the anime's setting and how cruel and relentless it is, Shingeki no Kyojin has a sense of epicness to it. You can see many of the plot twists coming way ahead of time, but in the end it doesn't really feel like it matters all that much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10:\\n\r\nAs far as the actual art style of Shingeki no Kyojin goes, I think opinions will vary quite a lot. When it comes to the characters themselves, it uses an extremely thick outline for their shapes which looks really strange but somehow works out alright anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe titans vary wildly in how pleasing they are to the eye, but then again that's mostly not a matter of art quality but rather merely that some of the titans are in fact supposed to look retarded. That being said I personally could never really feel the same intimidation from them that I think the series was trying to deliver. More so than not they just looked like oversized, brain damaged humans rather than terrifying monsters of destruction.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is really appealing is the setting itself. The world looks absolutely stunning, both when it comes to the city's infrastructure and the nature outside. There was even one particular moment in one episode where I had to pause the video just to confirm that it was in fact animated and not a real photo of nature.\\n\\n\r\nMost impressive of all though is the animation. Following the eyes of a soldier flying around the city via cables looks absolutely amazing, and likewise the actual fight scenes are crisp and polished. The various sword techniques used in midair look especially impressive.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10:\\n\r\nApparantly someone thought that German theme songs was a good idea to use for this anime, and that person made a damn good choice in that regard. The OST of Shingeki no Kyojin is stellar, with some inredibly epic music throughout, and some extremely memorable opening themes. The ending themes aren't quite as amazing, but still not anything worth complaining about.\\n\\n\r\nQuite frankly there isn't really much to say regarding this specific topic. The soundtrack does its job as well as you could possibly wish for, it's as simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the voice acting you're not going to find a masterpiece in particular, however it still has a quite famous seiyuu cast that don't leave much to be wished for untouched. There is one problem though, but it doesn't actually lie with the casting crew itself but rather with the characters they're voicing. To be specific, for the vast majority of this show, I kept feeling that the voice actors were too good for their own roles. I'll talk about why in the next section though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10:\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw of Shingeki no Kyojin is actually the characters themselves. Just about every top tier anime will have at least one iconic character that people can associate the series with. However with this series, there are none. Now this is not just because so many people keep dying left and right, but rather there is no single character that is actually all that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Eren, is in reality very generic. He's the typical hot-headed youth driven by thoughts of revenge while still always putting his friends before the mission. Very often you'll find yourself annoyed at how much of a blockhead he is when it comes to decision making and personality. His friend Armin is nothing special either, being the typical supportive character that wants to help his friends while in reality being fairly weak. The female lead Mikasa is a lot cooler as a character, but at the same time she's also very antisocial and quiet. Ironically this has led to the most popular person being a side character that's not even introduced until halfway through the series.\\n\\n\r\nPoint being, there is not really anything new nor creative when it comes to the characters themselves. They're not poorly designed, but it's nothing that hasn't been done time and time again before.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10:\\n\r\nDespite everything though, Shingeki no Kyojin is in fact very entertaining. It's a very unique and interesting concept, and the tempo is generally very high. Even when there isn't really any story progression it's still fun to watch, since the actual fight scenes aren't something you'll find in essentially any other anime, and they're almost artistic in the way they're designed. Since it's also one of those series that isn't afraid to break norms and kill off characters, you can never really take anything completely for granted even if many of the story plot twists can be seen coming ahead of time.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't actually have as many cliffhangers as you might expect, but rather the story arcs it has are extremely long. It often feels more like you're watching a movie in twenty minute parts rather than a tv-series, and because of that it really feels like a series you should marathon rather than watch episodic, regardless of your ususal preferences regarding that particular topic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10:\\n\r\nIn the end, Shingeki no Kyojin is a quite memorable series not because of how good it is, but because of how much it stands out. It feels like a concept you'd find in an average Hollywood film, except it's done as an anime, and in glorious fashion at that. While it is true that opinions vary wildly regarding this show, like it does for any abnormal series, I feel like it's something everyone should at least give a chance. It might not be your cup of tea, but it also might be the best anime you've ever seen. Anything goes.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter what, Shingeki no Kyojin has established itself as one of the biggest Titans in the current anime era.",

            "content": "First of all I want to say that I was actually against watching this and thought it was overrated, so I am not being partial at all, the reason I started watching this anime was because I was sick and had nothing else better to do. Now i will explain to you why I gave it a high rating which is highly unexpected. I should warn you that I have read the manga, meaning I know what happens after the anime, so, don't flame me for stuff happening after, I am only reviewing the first season!\r\nThe Story\r\nWell, the reason I gave it an 8 wasmainly because it was a too simple concept. The story was not really thought out well, don't flame yet, I will explain why. There are many types of stories and maybe one you've heard before is \"saving the world\", it is very common to have this type of story, while it's very common and maybe boring, some can actually make this a good type of story. I know that it's very hard to come up with a good (uncommon) story, but hey, that is what I think of that. I'm not saying that it's bad or anything, I gave it an 8 after all, but it would've been more interesting if it had a different unique story!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI should maybe warn you that I haven't seen that many anime, given that you can check my list, but the art style of Attack on titan is really different from what I've seen before, and I actually like it. The really visible outlining of the characters, the amazing background (non-moving environment), and also to point out the pupils of the characters, really detailed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI can say a lot of things about the sound, not only was the first introduction song (Guren no Yumiya) catchy but the OST of the anime are really good. It's good in a way how they could fit the sounds together with what was happening, they could really get the most out of the music and gave you different kinds of emotions. Watching some scenes would get me goose bumps, and some scenes would also make me cry, for me that is a 10 when I could live into the anime and get the same emotions as the characters. Some scenes would make me really excited. I would say good job in combining the two attributes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nI really like the characters, their different personalities and their appearance. After watching a couple of episodes I got fond to some of the characters, and would watch and see what they end up doing  in the series and how they live their life. You get a favorite character and some you might even relate to (personality that is). (In case you wanted to know, my favorite is Sasha Blouse). Some characters you might hate and some you might not even care for, and that is really good, that means they have succeeded in making each character unique.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nYes, as you might already have figured out, I really enjoyed this series, I was caught from the beginning. I really enjoyed watching and getting different types of emotions, wanting to know more about what was going to happen next. I really like how they managed to separate emotions, meaning that they have a scene for comedy and another separate scene for seriousness. some anime tends to mix these things, like having a comedy scene in a middle of a serious matter, and for me, that is really annoying. I don't like having comedy in the middle of a fight for example, that is just me I guess.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\r\nSo to sum this up, I was what you could say skeptic at first but after the first episode, I got caught in the wave, after that first episode, I just wanted to know more and couldn't get enough and for every episode, I wanted to follow my favorite character and see how she would end up. I cried, laughed, got angry, got sad, throughout the journey. At the end I was so curious that I started reading the manga, but it's not the same as the anime, you don't get the same emotions since you don't have the music, the voice actors and THEIR emotions, so I will probably wait until the next season and cry and laugh again!",

It has its little funny moments here and there. But those are very rare moments. It's more dark and deep than funny. If you're looking for a funny anime, you've come to the wrong place. \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nArt: 10/10 Beautiful, beautiful, and gorgeous. The animation is so good. Props to the animators.

I prefer the dub. The soundtrack is SOOOOO goodtoo. The song in episode 13 though.  \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 They don't have really memorable characters. YET. Armin is a little annoying. Mikasa is like fuck everybody else, I only care about Eren. It's like everyone can die for all she cares, as long as Eren is okay. Eren is.....Eren. Hopefully season 2 has better character development and in the manga. There's like ZERO character development. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 It's really good. I love the gore. It could be better though. Make a little character development, make some characters less annoying and self-centered, and we're golden. \\n",

I didn't plan on watching it until a friend of mine kept pushing me to do so, and I'll tell you now. I regret every second I didn't watch this anime after its release.\nI don't consider myself an anime fanatic, but I watched a bunch of anime in my time, and to me, Shingeki no Kyojin is this rare jewel you can find under a pile of uninteresting anime. It has been very long ago since I felt so excitedabout any anime at all. Everyone likes cool characters and some awesome action, but to me, that was just icing on the cake, and not as interesting as the atmosphere of the world. You don't find much anime with an environment full of pessimism like in this one. Each episode makes it clearer to you how hopeless humanity's situation is, that they are losing, and despite that, they try. It simply gets you absorbed into the world and the characters. With each episode you realize that there is always a little innocence left to lose. Love and warmth is taken away from the characters, and they become bitter and sad, and despite that, they never lose themselves entirely.\\n\\n\nI didn't mention that the soundtracks are also really great to hear, and I know that some people are encouraged just by a good opening music, and for all who didn't give this anime a chance, I recommend and urge you to try it out.

            "content": "Hello. I am new to this website as well as writing anime reviews, so this review might not be so insightful than the others. \r\nShingeki no Kyojin review (episode 1-10)\r\nShingeki no Kyojin (Attack of Titans)is an auspicious debut. It is visually and audibly entertaining, which is the primary reason why I gave this anime full marks in terms of enjoyment. \r\nSTORY 9/10\r\nThe story encapsulates all the necessary elements to make this film an action-packed madness with recurring hints of fantasy and unpredictability. While the plot is unoriginal in the concept of survival against foreign creatures, its ability to capture the eyes and minds of theaudience has forgiven this. Every important scene so far has remained vivid in my eyes and fresh in my mind. As Eren who is the protagonist, experienced the arrival of the humongous humanoid creatures, he witnesses a tragedy that fuels his desire for revenge. In his revenge plan, action blooms, suspense tightens, as he unleashes his anger towards the titans. This anime has met my expectations of a good story development, and I am hoping that it surpasses its potential. \\n\\n\r\nART 9/10\\n\r\nWhat is refreshing about this anime is how it successfully grasps the audience into the world of turmoil; the setting that denotes that survival is paramount. This feat was aided by the enthralling depiction of the realistic dystopia that the characters live in, as well as the AWESOME animations that takes place when tension arises between humans and titans. The humans and the titans were portrayed in a perfect balance; it is surrealistic without being too overtly down-to-earth. Additionally, the art on the character's facial expressions in different scenarios evokes a sense of feeling to us, and it makes us feel that we are in that character's position. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND 9/10\\n\r\nI think that the soundtrack is well suited to the anime's genre of action, fantasy and drama. Opening 1 has a perfect blend of these genres, and while I do not know what the song is about (I'm not Japanese), just by hearing the first 10 seconds tells me that the music choice is appropriate. In addition, the music prepares you for the upcoming action scenes to come and strengthens the impact it gives to the audience to a great extent. The sound effects were also exceptional. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 7/10\\n\r\nI gotta mention this; while there are no anime that is perfect, there are some who are near to that level though. One of the flaws in this anime is the lack of character development. Only Eren, Mikasa and Armin's past is portrayed and explained and all the main character's personality seems a bit bland to me. For example, there's Eren who's fuel for desire stems from his dark past of negative experiences. His ambition is already cliched, but why is his personality the same as well? Most of the time, he is depicted as a person who has been consumed by anger and revenge; surely there can be some happiness in his life, right? \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Mikasa, who actually has something (in this case, 'someone') to protect in her life, which is Eren. What is ironic is that Eren has an ambition, but no one to protect (except humanity indirectly), and Mikasa has something to protect, but no ambition ( except protecting Eren's welfare). In my opinion, the characters needed more dimensions in their personality and in their ambitions. However, I understand the fact that the characters live in a world full of hopelessness, and this might be the deep-rooted cause of it.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10/10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Shingeki no Kyojin, and I recommend it to all. Shingeki no Kyojin is a fulfilling present that is wrapped with exemplary art and sound components and is filled with a story that depicts utmost survival and an inevitable outrage of vengeance. The anime is also quite didactic, as it informs the audience the importance of mateship, as shown by the characters initiative to help each other in dire moments, and their abilities to work as a team.\\n\\n\r\nFinal rating: 9+9+9+7+10= 44/50 (8.8/10) Overall: A 9/10",

            "content": "Well, I'll admit that it's been a while since I tried to sit through this...\r\nWhere do I begin? Well, first of all, this anime is ridiculously overrated. I began watching it when a friend of mine was obsessed, and I have to say I was vastly disappointed. I knew that both online and in real life, people were mass-talking about SnK, so I guess I was expected more than what it was giving me.\r\nStory - 3/10\r\nWe've all already heard the one about the angry, slightly crazy main male protagonist who has some sort of weird connection to the antagonist/ism in the show, and the protagonist'sbest friend is always the overly emotionless girl who has crazy feelings. Okay, we get it! Pick something else!\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was interesting, but not very original. The titans could have been anything - wolves, a rebel group out in the woods, unicorns - and I'm not going to rate the unoriginal plot higher just because there's cool humanoid things that eat people alive. It's easy to guess what's going to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit, since I was not planning on finishing the series, I read the entire plot and the ending of the show. And my first reaction was, \"what? are you serious right now?\"\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nI would not consider the character's art very stand-outish, but the animation for the movement, blood and overall outfits the characters wear is gorgeous. The titans' designs are also interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nI had no problem hearing what was happening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10\\n\r\nAs I said above, I think Eren and Mikasa's character arcs are wildly overused, and many of the characters only seemed to be put there to move along the story, without ever really getting much out of them. Also, Eren's feelings about things don't match up with the ending at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3/10\\n\r\nAlthough story and art are both extremely important to me, above all else I need to enjoy it. Whether it makes me laugh or cry, I need to feel something. SnK just did not do it for me. I was constantly bored, and there was nothing particularly exciting about the series. I did not jump, or cry, or smile. I think the only time it triggered an emotion is when I covered my eyes once at a bloody scene, but other than that, nothing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3/10\\n\r\nI would not recommend this to any of my friends who haven't seen it. Like most quickly-popular anime, this is nothing to lose your mind over. It's another overrated piece that quickly bores you and leaves you with nothing to think about afterward.",

            "content": "Here's a fun fact, when I was 7, the first anime I ever watched was Detective Conan, when growing up I might have remembered the show or watched an episode or 2 of the show, then, last year I found out about this show, I gave it a try and ended up finishing it, I thought the show was amazing, a couple of months later I started watching anime, ironic I know. But looking at this show today, I don't think this show is as amazing anymore, why? Well, back then I was a newbie while today I know more about anime and can detectmore of the show's flaws. This show isn't the best of all time, hell its really damn mainstream, people go as far as calling it the \"Game of Thrones of Anime\" when those people have only seen about 2-3 anime series'. This show is too damn popular for its kind, how it gained its popularity is still a question to be unfolded.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with a wall, well 3 walls to be precise. Giants known as 'Titans have been eating humans for years so humanity builds these walls to keep them out, for 100 years there was peace until a titan somehow taller than the wall breaks it down and now humanity is in danger.\\n\\n\r\nA simple story, this could easily lead to a well written plot, well it does but it raises many questions, before those questions are answered we're brought another question. For example, Why are these titans eating humans? Do they look like chicken to them or something? Also the show's plotwists need explaining themselves, I haven't read the manga but I heard some of them are still unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is really well done, especially the gore which is exucuted in a way where it seems fucked up but at the same time seem not as fucked up, we only see a couple of scenes of gore, fight scenes or psychological scenes. Its a perfect balance of both and I love that. The backgrounds are beautiful and filled with dark but not too dark colours which brings out the darkness AoT has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, is just outstanding, both OPs are so damn well done, each one are epic as hell and make you want to listen to them over and over and not even get sick of them. Both EDs are OK for the most part, they really do bring a little light to the show. The voice acting is so damn well done, hearing actual screams and panics brings so much realism to the show, you feel like you're there with the characters. I would easily rate both Art and Sound a 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, we get introduced to way too many characters, in the second episode, we get all these characters introduced in just one episode, it tries to do that trick that shows such as Durarara and Baccano pull off so well which is where there are so many characters that it adds more fun to the show. Here there's so many characters that I wonder if some really matter to the story. Some of these characters hardly get any screen-time yet they're somehow meant to be important.\\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna look at the 3 MCs of the show, first we have Eren, some maniac who screams over everything and is so goddamn pissed off at everything, like you mad bro? He wants to get shit done but does it so poorly, he's meant to be that pissed off character that has feelings but instead feels like that pissed off character who's just....pissed off. Then we have Mikasa, she has an interesting past and is one of the most badass female MCs I have seen in a while, she's strong and cares for Eren and wants to see him happy again. Finally we have Armin, a pussy who somehow is fighting yet is too scared to go near a titan. But, he's smart as shit and plans well, he's like the brains of the MCs, evern though he's a pussy. It is pretty cliche, even though he does get some moments where he stands up for himself, he's an OK character for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing about the characters, in the army each character has been trained to kill the titans, yet all of them are scared shitless when they're in battle, like seriously, you've been training for years but still haven't grown a pair and actually fight these things. I've only seen like 5 characters that can actually kill, one of them is the MC, one is a side character and the rest aren't even important to the story or die! This is no logic, its just there as a reason to make these characters die.\\n\\n\r\nNow I did enjoy this show, its mystery really makes you want to see what happens next, its intriguing done in a good way and I like that. The action scenes are tense as fuck and will give you goosebumps, they will gobsmack you. If they don't then there's probably a problem with your skin or you're not human.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6.7\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.3\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nOverall, AoT is an enjoyable show. Now if you're a normal anime watcher, I reccomend this show in case you're bored or want something action-ey with a decent plot. If you're new to anime, this show will easily get you into anime like it did to me. Season 2 has been announced a while ago to come out in 2016....why so far away, the director said something about the manga reaching a certain point or something among those lines. If you can't wait for Season 2, you can read the manga from where the show left off (which is Chapter 34) many manga readers have said that the show gets even more tense. If you do get into this show follow it for its plot, sure it has some well done action scenes but AoT wasn't made for action like some shows like to do. For more shows like this show I reccomend Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, its follows the path that AoT does and its story is spread out across 64 episodes which is a lot of content, plus like AoT its focused on story.",

            "content": "To start off and to be quite honest in my review, this is the first series that I have completed in a year 1/2 so take it for what it is worth. \r\nAttack on Titan has been constantly raved about by many friends who are also big into Japanese Anime/ manga etc., and for a good while, I have refused to get dragged into it wondering if the reviews and praise would hold true if I ever were to delve into it personally. I shall agree with the praise regarding the show as a whole to a certain degree and in that phrase I shallexplain myself further. \\n\\n\r\nTo start off I shall perform this review in Tarantino fashion giving the show Attack on Titan a 9. Now like previously stated, allow me to further explain my reasoning.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story regarding Eren, Mikasa, Armin and assorted nameless and known characters trying to not only survive but to carve out a place for themselves in the \"cruel\" world of AOT is actually quite enticing and kept me wanting to know more and more.\\n\\n\r\nIn a short but certainly not spoiler filled paragraph, AOT revolves around three childhood friends and their desire and task of assisting humanity in combating these gigantic creatures with varying heights and demeanor's called Titans, who live outside the three walls of the kingdom where the show takes place and have a knack for eating human beings. The three characters aforementioned enroll in the military with the sole desire to combat the Titans after their hometown is destroyed and ultimately abandoned due to a titan attack.\\n\\n\r\nNow the story is very well done and there were times where I would be sitting back calmly and the next second, be on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next and where the story would take me. I can certainly see the similarities between this show and Death Note, especially in the creators proclivity for not holding back or following certain rules in stories in regards to what can happen and what cannot to main characters (I will not spoil anything but watch the it and you will see my point).\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nNow in regards to the overall animation and look of AOT, it is one of the most beautiful animes that I have seen in quite some time and harken me back to when I first saw Cowboy Bebop as a child, birthing this desire in me to see more and more if only to regain that sense of wonder at seeing such beautiful and imaginative worlds. My favorite scenes were when any action scene took place which featured the characters (both nameless and therefore throwaways, or known) zipping around the cities, and scenes with this gear referred to as omni-directional mobility gear or ODM for short. These scenes threw away the conventional 2-D approach and g=opted for a faux 3-D approach o the artwork, giving the viewer the sense that they were flying, comparative to the 'Spider-cam\" in the Sam Raimi Spider-man movies. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the episodes were filled with much dialogue that I felt wasn't truly necessary or either dragged on for too long, which made me all the more excited to glance upon the art of the speeding environments while the action picked up again. Overall, the art is very well done and I am certainly excited to see where the artists responsible for it go from here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds and songs of the show certainly match perfectly or as close as they can get to what is happening or how the creators want you to feel at any given moment/ situation. To start off, the 1st opening song (Guren no Yumiya) while very excited and exerting a bit of overkill at times, is a good start to the show and what to expect in terms of the action and situations that will occur. One of my favorites songs is titled: Bauklotze performed by Mika Kobayashi and has more of a presence later in the series. This song to me sums up what the show represents in its sense of: desperation but also of hope, even if it tends to fade at times. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nNow I have read a few other reviews of the show previously and I have to agree with  a lot of the reviewers in their assessment of the character element in the show. I felt this was the weakest part of the show and the creators, while putting in the old \"college try\" with character development fell short on what could've been a great cast. In terms of the characters that I liked, were: Jean, Sasha, Levi, Mikasa, and Eren while most of the other characters weren't given the proper time to really become human in my eyes. One of the characters that I truly despised and I use that word lightly was the character of Armin who in almost every encounter with the titan entities, would resort to whining and feeling sorry for himself which in the beginning drew me to him and made me feel for him but as the show went on and it looked as if he wasn't going to develop beyond or overcome that part of himself, annoyed me and made me wonder when he would either \"grow or fade\". \\n\\n\r\nI have to say that I found a lot of cliches with the characters, which saddened me greatly, especially with how great the characters in Death Note for instance were portrayed. Character truly was the weakest portion of the mix.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, I would say that I was thoroughly entertained by this show and I actually wanted to see what would happen next even when the show was a bit slow in its progression of events. This show has a great blend of action, drama, suspense and wonder to keep the fire going. My only qualm would be in regards for its \"plot holes\". Now I understand that there will probably be a second season due to its popularity but I felt like with every question that was answered, there would be two more questions in response to that one and maybe an answer strewn about here and there. I would've liked there to be more enlightenment in regards to: What are the titans? Where do they come from? How did the city come to be? etc., which took away from my enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI thought it was a great anime filled with a plethora of elements that will attract fans of varying genres although a warning must be mentioned that this is quite gory, reminding me of Devil May Cry/ Elfin Lied in terms of the \"no holds barred\" attitude with gore, human casualties. But if you can somehow get passed that (and if you have to term it in that way then this isn't for you), then you will find a rich show that has created a nice size fire within my mind, and heart; a fire that I only hope will grow with news of a second season and more development in certain areas (cough characters cough). I think the show as a whole has so much potential to become a classic, with a few minor tweaks to common story elements and I look forward to not only staying abreast of a possible return but also to re watching it again eventually.\\n\\n\r\n9/ 10.",

            "content": "Well lets have a look at it then. Attack on titan is splendidly made, featuring titans against humans. The concept has been set up so well, filling each minute with either action(humans standing up against titans with 3d gear), sad moments(people being swallowed by titans), and the small loveable moments you always want in animes(for instant the potato girl).\r\nNow some people say its overhyped, I beg to differ. It has everything i expected, and more. The soundtracks fits the moments so well, and it gives me chills.\r\nEither way if i had a complain it would be their lack of animators. While the animation of thestory, which looks a lot different from many other anime series, it creates a much better impression of both the titans and human. It makes the scenes so much more intense than another type of animation would, at least thats what i believe. But back to the animators. You notice some small blunders throughout the anime. For instant the marks on their uniform suddenly change color when they arent supposed to. Probably because they switch animators often, and pick up animating in the middle of a scene. Now luckily its something you hardly notice. First time i watched each episode i was so hung up on the awesomeness that it went straight through my mind.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the most superior animes out there, if you havent seen it yet, your missing out on a lot.",

            "content": "So, Shingeki no Kyojin was like the most hyped anime in the last season. Yeah, why not? There were good basics, survival horror and action, mixed with an interesting setting. These are usually conditions for a good anime.\r\nBut instead of that you get offered a bad production, logical issues and incredible weak characters.\r\nThe only reason why I finished this show is that I usually never drop any anime.\r\nStory:  The story is like 'end time survival-action', really exciting and it gets the interest of the viewer in an instant. All in all the story was quite good, almost amazing. BUT: there are so many logicalissues, unnecessary plot twists and stupid filler episodes that it dragged down the whole overall picture of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Graphics: Second worst point. Frankly, they did almost nothing right at this point. The facial expressions and emotions are awful, they totally don't look like they're supposed to.\\n\r\nThat's why many scenes just lose their exciting or dramatical effect because due to the named problems the scenes appear just weird.\\n\\n\r\nSound: All right, a good point again. The openings and endings are good, soundtracks are fitting. In my opinion the second opening is very catchy, I like it the most.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: *Sigh* Let's get over with this.\\n\r\nThe worst point, in my opinion, are the characters. They are totally flat and queasy. You can't produce an anime of this sort with these bad characters. The figures are just too inconspicuous and odd, which is an absolutely defect for survival-action.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Oh well, I  didn't really enjoy watching this, I just watched it, 'cause I don't wanna have any dropped anime in my list. Some episodes were quite okay, some others weren't. But to be honest, I was never looking forward to the next episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime was clearly overhyped; the result was bad. Everyone their own cup of tea, but I recommend you to not watch this series. It's not worth your time. \\n\\n",

Now, it's one of my favourites.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story is set in a dystopian world where giant human-like creatures (Titans) try to annihilate the human race. One day, Titans invade the main character's (Eren) district. Because of revenge, Eren strives to eliminate all Titans. At first, I didn't really like the story. But as the story developed, I got engrossed.\r\nArt: 10\r\nThe art was beautiful. It showed their expressions very clearly. The landscape and bird's eye views gave me a clear picture of the setting. The characters were also nicely drawn. Thecolours were realistic--not too colourful. And may I just say--Levi was sublimely drawn. I can see why people like him so much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe voice actors/actresses did an amazing job bringing their character to life; I'm talking about the Japanese version. The voices suited the characters well--not one was out of place. The first OP and ED were awesome-- the visuals, and how the visuals went along with the beat of the music. However, I gave it a 9 because of the second OP; I just think that it was too happy/hopeful for my taste. Nevertheless, I just prefer the first OP than the second.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters were unique, and they all had their own little quirks. Their personalities went well with the art. Most of them were badass-- they're just so cool. Need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 10\\n\r\nThough I didn't enjoy it at first, I'm glad I gave it a chance. I think I'm going to be obsessed with this anime for a while. \\n\r\nUltimately, this is a great anime.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A lot of people hate SnK.  Half of them just don't enjoy it, and half of them are just bandwagoning.  Personally, I love the show.  However, I could understand how somebody might not enjoy it.  Here's my breakdown:\r\nStory: 8\r\nI gave the story a 8.  I know it falls into the whole post-apocalyptic-future-where-humans-have-to-survive-against-horrible-monsters clich\u00e9 that's really overdone in TV and movies today, but I really enjoy the setting.  The plot is pretty good, with some titan fighting and some internal affairs within the walls.  It doesn't pull a Star Wars prequel trilogy with the non-action stuff and make itboring, so that's a plus, and the parts without action and excitement are pretty minimal.  The pacing is nice as well.\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe visuals are very well drawn.  The animation is very crisp, and you can almost feel when the 3D maneuver gear pulls a character somewhere, or when a character cuts the back of a titans neck.\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe show has an epic soundtrack to compliment the action, and 4 amazing themes (2 OPs and 2 ending themes for the recap movies) made by Linked Horizon.  Amazing music all around.  The sound effects are very nice as well, from movement with the 3D maneuver gear to the sword slices.\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 (Minor spoilers for the first episode or so)\\n\r\nA few of the characters are well developed, but Eren through most of the series is a pretty unoriginal character.  He keeps whining about trying to kill all the titans to avenge his mother and everything.  The other characters are pretty interesting, even if they are clich\u00e9d six ways from Sunday.  Levi is the strong silent type who is a germaphobe, Armin is the weak 3rd wheel always being saved by his friends, Mikasa is the protective older sister, etc.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are fun as hell to watch, and the other stuff is engaging.  You want to know what's happening inside the walls when others are fighting titans.\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime even with its flaws, and can't wait for next season.",

            "content": "Araki tries, but it's too heavy a burden. The staff occasionally offers exciting sequences, but all in all it's just a boring looking seasonal. The backgrounds are effective only until the foreground kicks in making visible its dullness. Thick outlines only emphasize the cartoonish nature which clashes with whatever realism it strove for. What is even the point of photorealistic scenery if it's accompanied by horridly placed crowds and uninspired shot composition? With so many stock buildings, clouds, trees, and whatnot populating the screen try counting the number of hand drawn objects in any given scene, it's quite disturbing. To see this being universally praisedas well animated baffles me. It barely fucking moves! Am I watching a different show from everyone else? Having glimpses of fluidity throughout doesn't equate to being cinematic, not by a long shot. Even the drawing is fairly erratic. I appreciate the epicness Sawano's soundtrack brings to the table as usual, perhaps the only aspect I thoroughly enjoyed. As for the rest, tryhard content that forces every point it tries to get across. The amount of circumstances transparently built to make Eren a victim, Mikasa a badass, and Armin a brainiac is insane. Not to mention the \"subtle\" foreshadowing which most people seem to freak over. Characters are mere cogs and the pacing is all over the place. Isayama exploits the premise for temporary tension at the expense of planning ahead, a path known to lead authors into devising convoluted explanations and informing them via tedious exposition, all contributing to a rather anticlimactic ending. The wonders of writing to a demographic that craves for immediate gratification at every turn. In sum, edgy schlock.\\n",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan was pretty great, it dominated over most of/all the other animes in 2013, and after watching the series I can see why it can be seen as one of the top series of 2013 or maybe even all time.\r\nStory 9/10 The idea of AoT is pretty awesome, it's about Humanity against the overpowered giant cannibals or titans for short, and throughout the show you get to watch humanity fight for their lives and try and come closer to the mystery of these giant monsters and why they are trying to exterminate the human race. The story was reallyinteresting throughout the entire show I found and although there is a lot of action the story still successfully manages to have quite a few other elements of different genres in it. This anime also paced the amount of episodes very well and nothing seemed that rushed or stretched longer then it needed to be for me, there are some parts of this anime that were to a point predictable but it didn't matter much i still found it very enjoyable by keeping me at the edge of my seat. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 The art was great one thing that was definitely noticeable was how fluent the animations were when they were in combat with the 3D maneuver gear it was so cool and I have never seen any anime have anything like that it's definitely a must see. Another thing that AoT contains a lot of is blood it's pretty nuts there is ton of it and i like seeing some bloodshed in animes but AoT may have went a bit over the top in this sense. The characters and titans all seemed to be detailed very well also including all of the the backgrounds. I would also buy this anime on blu-ray too see the art quality to it's full extent.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 The music is definitely very good the opening theme songs and the ending songs suit the anime setting very well and the battle music and heroic soundtracks in the anime are very well done as well they seem to start and end at the nearly the perfect times I also definitely enjoy the soundtrack and will end up listening to it in the future mainly Linked Horizon's opening for AoT Guren no Yumiya because there performance was incredible, I also found that the voice actors that were picked suited there characters very well (in English sub for me).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 The characters were outstanding they go pretty deep into explaining the main characters back stories and that is definitely one of the things i look for the most in an anime the way characters also reacted to certain events in the story was very realistic. There was some character growth to an extent in the anime the anime wasn't based on a long time frame so in the short time frame in the anime I thought the characters got progressively stronger in their distinct areas. One of the characters, Armin narrates at the start of every episode and i think it adds to the feel of the anime. I also think there are a lot of characters that people would like main or supporting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 If you really like action anime's or super power then you may come to love AoT because those are it's main areas and it did very well succeeding in those areas, My brother doesn't generally watch anime but he saw some of AoT and thought it was very well done so I think that even non anime fans would still like AoT. I would definitely re-watch all of AoT not because it's one of my favorite anime's as of now also because every episode was enjoyable or had exciting parts in it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i give this anime a 9/10 (my personal score is 10/10) if you have not watched AoT I encourage you to do so because if you enjoy the genre that AoT is in you will most definitely like it. I think that there was a massive amount of effort put into making every episode of AoT each episode seems like anime movie and was just awesome to watch and I hope that my review may make you watch AoT or maybe will make you want to re-watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "When I watched Shingeki no Kyojin/Attack on Titan for the first time, I thought it was a quite good anime, but not more. I watched through it like many other anime, without paying much attention. But when I watched it for the second time after approximately half a year, I was speechless. Amazed. Thrilled. Never have I seen such a heartbreaking anime before, which stirred up so many emotions inside of me. There are countless reasons why Shingeki no Kyojin is an outstanding example.\r\nIt is rare to see such a unique story in an anime. Mankind is at the brink of extinction because they areendangered by titans; therefore, they fight for their survival. You get the possibility to witness the desperate struggle of humanity from Eren J\u00e4ger\u2019s view, the main protagonist of the series. The story starts with the encounter of a colossal titan breaching through one of the three walls that protect humanity. After the titan\u2019s encounter, Eren J\u00e4ger and his childhood friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert decide to join the Military Corps; and this is where their adventure starts...\\n\r\nThe story triggers a lot of strong feelings, like despair, hope/hopelessness and sadness because they strongly appeal to your heart. This is one reason why Shingeki no Kyojin is exceptional; you can empathize with the characters, you feel the atmosphere of this world as if you were actually part of it. \\n\r\nThe complexity of the story is another thing I admire: it is not simple and foreseeable and you do not expect certain things to happen. Shingeki no Kyojin raises many questions in the course of the series and has many secrets that are not yet to be unfold, which makes it even more thrilling to watch. \\n\r\nThe last and most important point is that no matter how hopeless the situation seems to be, Isayama-san manages to bring hope into this world full of despair.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to music, I have to say that I am in love with the music of Shingeki no Kyojin. It is written by Sawano Hiroyuki, a famous composer who is known for his works on many anime (e.g. Guilty Crown, Kill la Kill, Aldnoah Zero). I generally listen to a lot of music and when I decided to buy the soundtrack, I was really glad that I did it. I found myself listening to it for hours every day and could not get enough. The reason why is that the music of Shingeki no Kyojin is so strong and breathtaking, good examples are the opening themes Guren no Yumiya (Feueroter Pfeil und Bogen), Jiyuu no Tsubasa or the ending theme Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai. The music is passionate and evokes so many emotions. It fits perfectly well with the different sections of the story and strengthens the atmosphere. I personally think that music is good music when it evokes deep feelings within us and sets us thinking. And this is what the music of Shingeki no Kyojin is exactly doing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is great. I like the strong colors and the depicted scenery. The characters are drawn with strong lines, which make them expressive; you can especially see it in the eyes. Everything is drawn realistically and beautifully and with many little details. What I really love is the emphasizing of certain passages in the story through the art. What I mean by that is that the eyes, for example, are drawn dramatically and are therefore accentuated, or particular face expressions are exaggeratedly drawn to strengthen the effect.\\n\\n\r\nComing to the characters of the story, I was positively surprised. Isayama-san managed to include so many unique characters. Every single character cannot be replaced because everyone is special in their own way. \\n\r\nStarting with the main characters, there is Eren, the boy with an inconceivable willpower who might not be physically very strong, but mentally. Then there is Mikasa, who is exceptionally strong (physically) for a woman. And there is Armin, who might be weak, but has the resolve to help wherever he can. He is a genius when it comes to creating strategies. The three of them complement each other with their personalities.\\n\r\nThere are also other lovable characters, like Sasha, who is known as the potato girl, or Hanji, who seems to be crazy about titans. And of course, there is also Levi, humanity\u2019s strongest soldier, whose power seemingly cannot be measured.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have to say that Shingeki no Kyojin is a great example for an outstanding anime; it is one of the best I have ever seen. It is one of my absolute favorites and I re-watched it 3 times because it is so good and always gets better. I really enjoyed watching the anime and cannot wait for the next season. \\n\\n\r\nI hope I could give you readers a good impression of Shingeki no Kyojin - enjoy every second when you are watching it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cSuperb, violent, dark and calculated. A composition that starts with a pianissimo and ends with a fortissimo... A masterpiece.\u201d\r\nREVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!\r\nHopelessness against a stronger foe, an overused plot in the literature and movie business. Works like: Independence Day, The War of The Worlds, Alien, Falling Skies \u2013and others- ring a bell with that sort of description. \r\nSo the question is: What makes \u201cATTACK ON TITAN\u201d that appealing? What makes it have such great reviews? We will see\u2026\r\nLet\u2019s start\u2026!\r\n-STORY: 9-\r\nDespair is a word that would describe amazingly this show. As I previously stated the \u201cbase\u201d plot isn\u2019t one of the most original things out there,but the aspects and \u201clore\u201d used within the show are what makes it original and most importantly a show worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nAnother characteristic that makes the story innovative is the fact that it isn\u2019t just your ordinary and plain shows about humans against a \u201cforeign\u201d adversary or the typical \u201chumans aren\u2019t THAT weak\u201d show, but in reality this story is more complex, it\u2019s a story about the human nature. What makes us strong? What makes us weak? What makes us so corruptible? The fight between what\u2019s right and wrong? The value of friendship and trust in others. The why we fight or why we should fight?\\n\\n\r\nSo, enters \u201cATTACK ON TITAN\u201d a world under attack by titans, titans that have something mysterious within them and not your typical \u201cI just want to destroy humans because the writers where lazy\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly the \u201cmyth\u201d in which \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d is created around is rich, huge and amazingly well-grounded.\\n\r\nThe starts begins with a \u201cbang\u201d, followed by another \u2013and vaster- \u201cbang\u201d that leads to an perfect and well-coordinated climax that ends in a massive, ecstatic and well-obtained ending. By this I mean that this show isn\u2019t the average let\u2019s throw some problems, problems that by the end of the show will get out of proportion and we \u2013the writers- will have to use something absurd to contain it. No, this show is as I stated before \u201ccalculated\u201d \u2013like a composition that starts with a pianissimo and ends with a fortissimo-. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cAttack on Titan\u201d is the type of story that will make you feel many mood changes within the lapse of each episode. Some moods will be because of the situations, some because of the corruption and others because of the friendship inside the show. It\u2019s a show that transcends from the screen to your heart and mind.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ART: 10- \\n\r\nMesmerizing. The art in \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d from the moment it start it catches you, it immerses you within the show, it\u2019s like a slap in the face for it catches your eyes and every one of your senses. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s colorful. It isn\u2019t depicted by your typical \u201cDark Palette\u201d used in shows like this. No, it is delightful; it\u2019s an explosion of color that depicts the situation and mood in the ambient which are perfectly detailed and believable. And the characters are amazingly well achieved and also believable.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND: 10-\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve said before I place the sound and music of a show as -probably- the most important thing of the show \u2013aside from the story of course-. And in all honesty the ambient sound, the voice acting and the soundtrack left me speechless.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is a piece of art, filled with passion and each line of the script has a meaning behind it, it isn\u2019t your average script.\\n\r\nMeanwhile the soundtrack, a work by Hiroyuki Sawano (Aldnoah.Zero, Ao no Exorcist, Guilty Crown and KILL la KILL) is AS ALWAYS perfect. The opening song of the album \u201cAt\u2019aek ON Taitn\u201d with the beautiful voice of Mika Kobayashi is a song that shows the passion, the darkness, the despair and the feelings behind the whole album AND show.\\n\r\nSome of the most beautiful violin arrangements. \\n\\n\r\nA-MUST-HEAR-SOUNDTRACK!\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER: 10-\\n\r\nThis is other aspect in which \u201cATTACK ON TITAN\u201d shines. Mainly because of the character development within the show and not just a \u201cdepartment\u201d in which only the MC\u2019s (Eren Yaeger, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert) take part, but even the supporting characters have an amazing development within the show, something that usually doesn\u2019t happen for the main attention given just to the MC\u2019s.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has his or her own will, goal and believes, making this department another jewel within the show. \\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT: 9 & OVERALL: 10-\\n\r\n\u201cATTACK ON TITAN\u201d is one of those shows that make you feel what the characters are feeling. It\u2019s one of those shows that leave you wanting more for being that good.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s super enjoyable and recommendable.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "A review of a masterpiece? Yes, yes that's exactly what this is. Yes I will compare it with the manga but only when necessary. \r\nShingeki no Kyojin (SnK,) is one of the most amazing anime series of all time and it fully deserves its hype. A story of humanity, remorse, will, courage, revenge, sadness, life, death, suffering, carnage, military, the list continues... If these are aspects that you like in anime then this is definitely for you. If you like slice of life, comedy and dislike anything sad then walk away, walk far away. SnK made me cry more than any other anime, mainly becauseof how emotionally enveloped I was with the story. Don't judge a book by its cover, in this case anime, yes there are unclothed man-eating giants running around, grow up and watch it, you get over that fact pretty quickly. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10 - The story follows the storyline of the manga almost exactly, the anime is set in chronological order while the manga jumps from past to present, the anime also adds a few scenes of epicness. The story starts out intense and then gets a tad boring for some during the military training episodes, don't drop it. It gets so much more intense. If you want to avoid spoilers then don't look up anything! The anime does end at a cliffhanger and fans are waiting for the highly anticipated season two, if it bothers you enough then catch up on the manga. The anime cuts off right before the really good stuff starts, new chapters come out every month, I recommend it if you're as impatient as I am. But if you can wait then wait, the anime is much better. It is a psychological anime to an extent, there are way more unknowns then knowns which can be frustrating yes, but that factor creates a sense of suspense which actually is a fantastic touch and makes the story even more enjoyable. Grab a box of tissues, close all the curtains, have something to hug, and give SnK a well deserved marathon. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10 - Some people have issues with the animation... The animation is spectacularly done for its budget. The perspective isn't first person however, it's just as up close and personal, giving you a front row seat of the characters' suffering and the clear carnage of the situation. The character design is very original, the titans are drawn incredibly terrifying in the beginning and their quality dwindled some later on, however, I didn't even notice it until Gigguk pointed it out in his review of the anime. The animation is highly enjoyable and is fantastic during the fighting scenes especially, it flows superbly. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10 - This soundtrack... Is orgasm worthy. Composed by the amazing Hiroyuki Sawano, it features Japanese, German, and English OSTs that get your heart beating fast as they keep you on the edge of your seat. If you enjoyed Guilty Crown's soundtrack, then you'll love SnK's, Hiroyuki-san composed them both. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10 - The story mainly focuses on Eren and his path of revenge, however it's a nice vantage point for the story. The anime has many characters and show cases them in a nice fashion. Information wise, we know just about as much as Eren. SnK features some of the most loved characters, everyone has a favourite. The relationships between the characters... I think this is what really made the anime as sad as it was. Even if those relationships weren't as detailed as others, they still displayed emotional attachments. Fangirls rave on Levi while fanboys rave for Mikasa, everyone gets to rave about someone, all the characters are epic. The character quotes are fantastic and every character is incredibly real. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10 - I enjoyed this anime like crazy, I'm a die hard fan, and if you asked me to join the Wings of Freedom/Scouting Legion I would gladly put my life on the line like the other characters. I'm excited for more of the series, based on what I know of the manga, season two is definitely worth the wait. I don't usually shed tears while watching anime, SnK made me bawl like a baby X3 and I respect it for doing so. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10 - SnK showcases the full extent of military themes, sacrifice, human fragility, and revenge. It's a must watch for many, just be sure to have tissues! :3",

            "content": "Story 9: Humans are forced to live behind a massive wall in order to avoid being killed by man-eating monsters called Titans. Overall the story was excellent. The premise was unique and the plot twists were exciting. The story flows in a linear, arc-based format so there isn\u2019t a monster/titan of the week that you might get in other anime. I generally prefer this format because I think the series can cover more ground and show more character/plot development. I was also impressed by some of the mature themes that the series tried to explore. To name a few: needs of few vs needs ofmany; idealism vs pragmatism; qualities of a good leader; the value of friendship and family; ugliness of human nature. These aren\u2019t new topics in the world of anime but I think AoT did a better job than most at fleshing them out and really making the viewer feel characters\u2019 struggles.\\n\r\nI have a couple of additional points. First, I thought that there were definitely a few slow parts that didn\u2019t really add anything to the experience. Plus, there were some episodes that lacked any action. Maybe it was done on purpose to build suspense. The battle scenes are definitely worth it though. The series showcases a unique style of fighting that uses \u201c3-D maneuvering devices\u201d. Basically the soldiers have these gas-powered grappling hooks that can propel them in any direction and allow them to maneuver like spider man. It\u2019s hard to describe but it\u2019s fucking awesome. It reminds me a little of the slick action sequences in Darker Than Black. These fight sequences alone make AoT worth it. It does annoy me that the series ends on a moderate cliffhanger. To make matters worse, the Manga is relatively new too so there is probably not enough content for a new 24 episode sequel series yet. Sorry.\\n\\n\r\n Characters 9: This is probably the best part of the series because a lot of effort is given to develop the main and supporting characters, and the series has a LOT of supporting characters. Some of them are central to the plot, some of them are meant to be Titan fodder, some of them you THINK are too important to die but then they get eaten anyway. In that sense it\u2019s like Game of Thrones where they keep you guessing. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9: Beautiful. I loved the battle/ride through in the forest. The action scenes are amazing and the city maneuvering is really really well drawn. The other thing I really liked was the design of the Titans. Their faces and bodies just ooze with creepiness. They are not stereotypically \u201cscary\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d looking like the clich\u00e9 monster, but eerily ordinary looking. You\u2019ll have to see for yourself but they shamble around in large doughy bodies with soulless stares, and remain devoid of emotion as they shove screaming civilians into their mouths. To me that\u2019s a lot more unsettling than a fierce looking enemy. \\n\r\nSound 10:  loved the first intro song and it went straight to my ipod\u2019s workout mix. The rest were good but not great imo.\\n\\n\r\nSatisfaction 9: Love it. I want more and you will too.\\n\\n\r\nBlood/Gore: A lot of scared soldiers getting eaten alive. \\n\r\nLove/romance: virtually none. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s introduced as the manga/anime develops but don\u2019t expect it in S1.\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: Not unless you have a Titan fetish.\\n",

            "content": "1. The premise.\r\nHumans were almost exterminated by titans, now living behind a wall, wall suddenly gets destroyed, mother of MC is kill. So far, so good. Now while this does look like an interesting premise for a proper war drama at first it suffers from the fact that there are titans. Which makes the whole thing quite fantasy like. That aside, the premise, which could have been used to give the characters, y'know, more depth or something by making it longer than two fucking episodes, set up an interesting start for the series.\r\n2. Story\r\nEverything that followed was utter crap. 2 episodes in and a timeskiphappens. Great, because we all love timeskips so much. They give you the chance to completely change the personality of any character at any given time because \"timeskip\".\\n\r\nA good timeskip would be something like: \"I hate you -> I hate you but I partly understand you thus I refuse to do something with my hate\"\\n\r\nA bad timeskip is something like this: \"I hate you -> I still hate you lol\"\\n\r\nSnK is a good example of a bad timeskip. The characters didn't gain any kind of depth through it and basically remained as one-dimensional as they were.\\n\r\nNow back to the main issue, the actual story.\\n\r\nThe pacing was extremely fast at first but then it slowed down so much that it felt even slower than your average slow paced show.\\n\\n\r\nNow what does slow pacing in an action centered show mean? Right, IT GOES NOWHERE. They spent roughly 8 episodes for one arc and used 5 minutes to recap everything. Not only that but nothing in the story, which is supposed to be about a war drama or something, which COULD happen to our dear MC-kun gives you a feeling of danger because ever since episode 5 everybody knows he can transform into a titan and is basically invincible.\\n\\n\r\n3. The CAST\\n\r\nLet's save the best for the last.\\n\r\nMost characters were forgettable.\\n\r\nNot just forgettable but uber-forgettable. Because they didn't have any personality or only a screentime of 10 minutes. Now when 5 people die in a titan attack and someone screams \"GUNTHER DIED\" you wonder which one of these samefaces was Gunther. Same goes for this one girl who wanted Levi's D. Petra, was it? She had a screentime of 10 minutes, she cared about Levi and died an episode or a few minutes later while thinking about Levi. How sad, right? This, my dear friends, is forced drama.\\n\\n\r\nBut what would an anime be without a main character or a group of main characters?\\n\r\nThey were UNDERWHELMING.\\n\r\nEren was supposed to be given character development throughout the series but it never happened. He was just ... there. \"GOTTA KILL THE TITANS\" is how you could describe him. Or in a single word; anger.\\n\r\nMikasa is the beauty which is looking out for Eren and is willing to kill anyone who'd harm him without a second thought. Because he saved her life once. Understandable but doesn't give you the right to make \"Protectiveness\" her defining character trait.\\n\r\nArmin is the brain of the group and goes from incompetent to somewhat competent. Arguably the only good character in the whole fucking show and even he is not all that good.\\n\\n\r\n4. Animation and sound.\\n\r\nTop-notch.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nEntry-level anime for those who search for something cool like titan killing kids flying through the city.\\n\r\nIt's Spiderman just with wires instead of spiderwebs. And air-battles.\\n\r\nAnd edgyness.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\n5.5/10, a bit better than average but still not as good as people make it out to be.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin was one of the top rated anime in this season and I had high expectations on this. However, it did not meet my expectations although it was a well-produced anime with realistic graphics and awesome character development.\r\nFor those who do not enjoy gore and despair in an anime, I do not recommend you this anime since you may probably end up with nightmares at night. Even I almost ended up puking in the end since humans were killed like flies without any consideration and I found it hard to accept that the lives of humans can be so easily lost.\r\nHowever, I haveto admit that the storyline was very unique and attractive since it was different from the common anime where hope was actually visible with the progress of the anime. In SnK, even with the protagonist, hope for mankind was barely visible and it was frighteningly easy for one to fall into despair just like the people within the anime. As I didn't read the manga, from the ending of the anime, I could only say that mankind was doom for destruction in the face of the ultimate enemy: titans.\\n\\n\r\nAs for character development, the producers did a really good job in defining the characters. For the main protagonist, Eren, his hatred towards the titans throughout the storyline is what propels the plot forward, and for me, it was tough to accept as the depth of his hatred was overwhelming. Truthfully speaking, I did not like his character, and probably he was one of my unfavored characters. On the other hand, LEVI (Rivaille) was awesome, pronto. Enough said right? He is the only reason I would say \"I LOVE this anime\".\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I personally did not like this anime as its gore and the despair I felt while watching this anime left me feeling desperate, dark, and gloomy even after the anime ended. It certainly did not leave a good aftertaste. But just because they presented an awesome character, I rated this anime a decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. If I were to live in the world of SnK, I will immediately commit suicide when facing a titan because I definitely do not want to get eaten by such a ridiculous and disgusting living thing with weird running habits and leaves you feeling extremely gross.

            "content": "Attack On Titan, AKA Sword Art Online 2.0\r\nIt's seems this hype train decided to make another stop this summer.\r\nStory: 6\r\nAttack On Titan starts off very strong, the setting is very original and the story line is very unique. I think everyone will agree with me that episode 1 almost made you shit yourself with excitement and left you begging for more, then it all goes downhill. Then you get a couple of boring episodes of Eren + friends training and shitting around. The show keeps up this constant trend of interesting action episodes to boring explanation episodes. They never decide they need to explain whatthe fuck is going on, no explanation whatsoever. The only hint we get to how it's even possible for Eren to turn into a Titan is a shitty fragmented flashback of his dad talking about their basement. No one ever explains why these humans who can turn into Titans are trying to break the fucking wall down. After watching this show I decided to read the manga and get this, nothing has been explained. They just keep dancing around the fucking question, as if the explanation is supposed to be brilliant. If you want a storyline where barely any progress is made, I definitely recommend this for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nOf course the art is gorgeous, it's one of the newest anime's of 2013. You actually give two shits about the art when you watch an anime then you'll love this one, but giving it a higher rating than something like Trigun because of the animation is idiotic. The animation in this show is created with the latest technology, this technology hasn't always been around.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nOther than the first five seconds of the opening song I don't really care to listen to it. It does what every anime with action in it does, use orchestral music, that always works. Anyways I subtract one point for unoriginal music choice and an only decent opening song (completely my opinion).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nProbably what drags this anime down the most is the main character.\\n\r\nEren: A typical shonen hero, thinks he can beat anything and he is very ambitious. We have a term for these kind of people, all bark and no bite. The whole anime is him getting his ass-kicked. But wait I forgot about that one moment where he transforms and beats up some titans on no! Thank God the plot was so convenient that Eren was eaten by a Titan and he awakened his own special powers while being digested by this oversized mentally handicapped humanoid. Like every other typical shonen heroes he is unique, he has some special power which makes him worth a damn. Since he couldn't kill Titans like a normal soldier he relies on his overpowered emotionless girlfriend(Yuno 2.0) to save him half the time or every other soldier to sacrifice them-self for him. His altogether uselessness shines when another intelligent titan comes, kicks the crap out of him and then captures him requiring Mikasa to come save him while teaming up with the badass emotionless OP Levi. Jesus, he even makes Armin look useful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nHad me really interested sometimes and then other times I was completely bored.\\n\r\nSAO was much more able to keep me consistently entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5\\n\r\nMeh, bandwagons just make it seem better than they actually are.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin (A.K.A Attack on Titan) is a complicated topic for me.  My first time through I really enjoyed it and watched about 8 episodes right through and got caught up pretty quickly.  However, I was completely unable to watch it at all a second time through.  I give it a 5/10 purely due to the initial impact which it gave me.  I will list some of my opinions below:\r\nPros:\r\nThe World and Setting -- Honestly the main selling point of the show, the set up and world is one of the most original settings I've seen and it's what keptme engaged for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nAction Sequences -- In my opinion, the action sequences were well done and the art style complemented the series well.\\n\\n\r\nImpact -- The series does a nice job of reeling you in (especially the first episode) and there is really nothing else like this series at the moment and the death scenes are quite gruesome\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nThe Characters -- People will likely try and defend them, but the characters are just boring.  Eren has an enormous rage boner the whole time, Armin is made out as being really smart but doesn't actually show any indication of being that intelligent, Mikasa was cool until Levi showed up and was basically better at everything and then Mikasa proceed to become not only less useful but an even more boring character.  Erwin was one of the few pretty solid characters.  The rest are so dull they don't really warrant being mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nThe Plot  -- I'll try not to spoil the plot, but in the anime and the manga the author has only shown himself to be capable of using one plot line:  Eren gets kidnapped and Mikasa and/or Levi later on have to bust his ass out.  The basement was presented as this cool mysterious element, but the author has not really done anything with that, and what the manga has alluded to about the titans was something I came up with 5 episodes into the show.  Really disappointing in my opinion, especially when the author created a world with so many possibilities.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\nThe Music -- I love Hiroyuki Sawano.  I really liked his work in Guilty Crown and Blue Exorcist, but I just felt like it was kind of out of place and didn't really fit the series really well.  Maybe would have preferred Yuki Kajiura for a show like this (although she tends to be a bit repetitive).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the show the first time around, but all consequent viewings caused its numerous glaring flaws to become apparent.  The pacing in the show is very poor and there are many episodes where nothing really happens for better or for worse.  The show takes itself really seriously and likes to act like some events were huge plot twists when it was incredibly obvious ever since the start (although there are some which are actually surprising in the manga).  It's good points sadly just don't measure up to it's flaws in my opinion, which is a shame.  It's worth a watch, but maybe not a second.\\n\\n\r\nSide Note:  I also wish there wasn't so much Eren x Levi Yaoi material around the internet",

            "content": "The show has spectacular animation. The fights with the titans are breathtaking. Everything else in between, however, is garbage. \r\nThe filler in between titan fights is incredibly boring. It drags and drags on until they throw a predictable twist at you. The plot is pretty good, but at times, they try a little too hard to surprise the viewer.\r\nThere is no character development, and it is very difficult to root for any of them. Every character is one dimensional without any depth. They are all annoying caricatures. The two main characters that the show focuses on, Erin and Armin, whine throughout the entire show, andthe only character worth rooting for, Mikasa, pretty much disappeared towards the end of the season. As strict as Levi is, it is very exaggerated and unnecessary. He beats up Erin in the middle of the court room, and no one seems to think that it's a big deal. That scene, like most in the show, was so over the top. By over the top, specifically, I mean it was exaggerated extremely more than it needed to be to get the point across. I like violence in my anime as much as the next guy, but scenes like that are just out of place. The violence when fighting the titans, however, is amazing and in the right place.\\n\\n\r\n Overall, the show looks cool and has amazing animation, but the characters have no depth. There needs to be more explanation of why the characters act the way they do to feel any sort of empathy. Until then, I hope the titans end up on top.",

            "content": "Well then, here I sit and wiggle my toes around in the shark tank of fans. I know I'm taking a big risk by putting my tender little opinionated toes into said tank where they might be devoured by the beasties below me that perceive them as insults instead of honest and fair criticisms of their so called\" perfect\" show, so here we go. \r\nUsually when I watch an anime I seek out what people are saying about it so I go in watching it and deciding whether to finish it as college has made me such a busy little bee. But when even non-animefans are talking about this show and everyone else is either praising it or shoving yet another nauseating \"haha they kill off your favorite characters\" joke for the billionth time, I begin to question the horde and their hurricane of hardons for the show and get a little skeptical. So when my friend said we would sit down and watch it, I couldn't help but feel like I've lost my uniqueness. But after finally finishing it I'm really proud to have had criticisms of it while enjoying the show as well. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the premise, and the consistent theme of hopelessness and horror that plague the humans and soldiers behind the walls. Granted at times it was hard to care about said characters. You spend the most screen time with Eren and while he is your typical angsty \"I can do this because courage\" protagonist, he did grow on me and I started to feel bad for his struggles and took pride in his accomplishments. But the rest of the cast is just really meh to me, and I started to enjoy seeing characters like Pixis and Levi boss them around and bring them to their senses after having a dramatic exposition. The rest of the cast seems to only have one personality characteristic (Sasha likes eating, Connie is pissed off, Mikasa is determined, etc.) and development of these characters is scarce if not completely nonexistent. And the show's action makes it move at such a breakneck pace, that with the exception of Eren, you never get a full picture on who these people really are. Even with Mikasa and Armin, they are Eren's friends, but neither have much of a personality, and the fact that they're willing to trust Eren no matter if he can turn into a colossal, unpredictable killing machine is just naive. Not to mention that many of the side characters' melodramatic conversations seem to take place during a 5 minute post-action interval where the Titans must have been taking a convenient breather and they only really solidify the fact that they have to keep fighting instead of having such conversations keep the plot moving. \\n\\n\r\nThe titans themselves really are the best part of the show, and having humanity being slowly devoured by horrifying naked caricatures is a great, scary concept in and of itself, and you praise the humans when they get killed That breakneck stream of action was the best part of the show, and the operatic music tracks combined with bone-crunching violence and facial drawings so intense they pop out of the screen, I couldn't help but enjoy the excitement the show had to offer. The plot and pacing can help with that, as each episode leaves off in a way that makes you want to watch the next one. Sometimes it's really cheap though, especially when they leave off when they appear to kill someone off only to have a convenient victory pulled out of their bum by the next. The plot, as said before is good but lacks focus, especially after everyone thought that the secrets of the Titans and the key to victory was locked in Eren's dad's basement, and the Scout Regiment and creators of the show were just like \"yeah let's NOT do that\" for some reason. Granted here I'm willing to go easy on the show here, and despite this unanswered question and the fact that the Colossal Titan only shows up once or twice, I can accept the answer to wait for a second season. \\n\\n\r\nSo as mentioned before, despite the hype and having fans spoil little events in the show, I did enjoy Attack on Titan for its awesome art, thrilling action and exciting soundtrack, but not so much its melodramatic characters, all too convenient plot, and unanswered questions.",

            "content": "Is Attack on Titan is one of my favorite animes? Yes, and there are many reasons for that.\r\nIs Attack on Titan is the greatest anime that I never see? No, and there are many reasons for that too. And I will explain why.\r\nStory / 7\r\nEven if some people consider Attack on Titan an average shonen, like One Piece, Naruto or Bleach, I can't see this anime like that. Compared to these light-minded, friendship and justice forever animes, Attack on Titan bring us to the darkness of the human being, the pitiful selfishness and cowardice in front of the worst terror that we could imagine -the brutal annihilation by someone stronger than us.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to explain how this anime played so easily with my emotions, how some moments were so strong that they brought tears to my eyes. I think many people here explained it better than me.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, I have to say that Attack on Titan is still a shonen, and so, brings with him some flaws of the average shonen. When you look back to those twenty five episodes, you can see that it's slow. A slow story, with some more boring episodes between the main two arcs, with a lot, A LOT of battles. The anime (I said the anime because it doesn't necessarily apply to the manga) is a shonen, but a very good shonen who doesn't quite looks like any others.\\n\\n\r\nArt / 10\\n\\n\r\nAaaaah, the art! How can you talk about Attack on Titan without mentioning the beautiful work between the images ? The animation, the colors, the atmosphere is remarkable, the same quality has the best movie for some moments. I couldn't say it's perfect, because some episodes are less beautiful than others, but DAMN. I don't think you never seen an anime looking like that before.\\n\\n\r\nSound / 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a good reviewer about the music of something, but, you know, here the whole thing - the music is as astonishing as the art, and both of them together can be described in one word - epic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter / 6\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is the worst point of Attack on Titan, even if it doesn't bothered me when I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nBecause Attack on Titan is such an oudstanding piece of work, with all the colors and the music and the emotions assembled so greatly with each other that you don't remark that any of the main characters has any  \u00ab psychological evolution \u00bb (I don't know if you say it like that, but oh well you understand). Like most of the shonen characters, they are, at the final episode, the same that they were as the first one, or almost - they doesn't really evolve, doesn't really mature. All of them (with some exceptions, I admit) are cliches, and they will be cliches to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't really bothered me because, well, I like shonens, and so I'm used to this. But if you don't like the whiny Eren, the crazy Mikasa or one of the most important characters, maybe you will not enjoy as much I has enjoyed it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinally, Attack on Titan is not the greatest anime ever. It has too many mistakes, too many imperfections for me to call it the perfection, like FMB. But, like Death note many years ago, Attack on Titan is surely one of the most enjoyable anime that I never seen in my life. It's a rollercoaster of emotion and epicness, a well executed horror and action show, an anime so better than the average that it's difficult to ignore it. Trying it will not cause you harm, I swear ;).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS. Sorry for the english, I'm french-canadian :)",

            "content": "At least 100 years ago, out of the blue, God decided to troll humanity by sending a bunch of impetuous, mongoloid, gigantic, neutered, crack fiends to Blitzkrieg the f**k out of the human race. For some f**king unexplained reason, these infatuated retards only attack suckers that have monkey DNA in their gene pool. Humanity got assraped and every country ever, was eaten up, with the exception of Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The surviving people then somehow built a huge f**king wall to keep the f**ktarded titans away from their Reich. How this was accomplished was never explained, and thus far, it sounds completely and utterlydips**t insane. This is the kind of plot you put together when your heroin runs out. \\n\\n\r\n100 years later, God decided to spawn a Level 100 Titan right next to the city of Shiganshina, which gets completely destroyed and in the process everyone f**king dies... again. Our main character Eren J\u00e4ger sees his mother get eaten by an emo titan, and then declares that he will kill every single one of them, while frenetically crying his tear ducts off. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa and some pussy ass, best material for a prison bitch, named Armin, decide to join the military. After 5 years of hard work and crying, Eren, Mikasa, Armin, and some other faggots nobody cares about, complete their military training and are in the top 10. They join the Recon Corps (the guys who failed to protect Shiganshina), even though they could've joined the Military Police and lived a peaceful life in the capital while masses of n00bs would've died at the Outer Walls. \\n\\n\r\nThe Colossal Titan (It's Bertholdt) from Shiganshina appears once again to pwn humanity, but this time, they manage to evacuate the City in time while the Recon soldiers act like retards and die. Mikasa skillfully pwns 90% of the invading Titans, while Eren dies and Armin cries while fagging out. Everyone runs out of gas and is about to get f**ked but then another Titan (Eren in cosplay) shows up and beats the c**p out of the other Titans, leaving only a mess of blood and gore behind while ignoring humans. \\n\\n\r\nThe Titan eventually runs out of Stamina and dissolves, revealing that it was actually Eren! After some more crying, he is about to get executed by the military but saved by some Nazi General called Pixis. Pixis wants Eren to carry a convenient boulder to a conveniently-sized hole in the wall, thereby \"fixing\" it. In typical Animu fashion, Eren loses his mind upon biting his hand to turn into a Titan and almost pwns Mikasa. Armin eventually manages to somehow talk him out of it while stabbing him during the course of an entire episode, while 897 people die defending him. He successfully fixes the wall and is then almost raped by the Pope in court, but some 31337 Recon soldier named Levi beats him up in front of everyone. Since he didn't turn into a Titan while getting pwned, he gets transferred to the Recon Corps. From this point forward, the blatant Levi/Eren yaoi moments occur. \\n\\n\r\nBelow is a list of self insert characters you can related to, since this show is nothing but a bunch of fan services and naruto tier bulls**t, all sewing together. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\r\nEren Jaeger - Literally the angry german kid and obligatory whiny ass, emo kid that is required in Anime anymore because . . . girls After watching a large naked retard using his mom for mouth job, he swore to kill all titans, but ended up almost failing the class and have his ass handed to a titan. He is somehow a titan and don't ask why just believe it.\\n\\n\r\nMikasa - Some random stranger Eren found in a stranger's home where she was almost raped by weabos looking to f**k the last Asian and last Asian kid. In true weabo fashion they weren't as interest in Mikasa as they were in her mother, not because she was a kid but because she was only half Asian. Having altruisticly saved her by fulfilling everyone's fantasy of killing a weeb, and because he's like every dickless, anime male he never thought of using her as his sex doll or cock warmer when all he'd have to do is ask and she'd say yes. (Think of Shinji and Asuka in Evangelion without all the Whininess and bitchiness.) For some reason, Misaka was able to do SUPER well in the class and was able to carry her newbie team against armies of large, agile senior citizen nudists from Myrtle Beach (because the writers want to feed the fanboy belief that a newbie 110 pound Asian girl will always be better than a well trained, experienced 240 pound acrobatic Aryan male). Oh yeah, She is also the only asian girl with a Japanese name, living in a population full of Germans. She is literally the last asian. \\n\\n\r\nArmin - Useless weak ass gay little bitch who follows Eren around because he wants to suck his micropenis. His whole reason for being is to distract Jaeger from ideas of f**king Mikasa by constantly bringing up Boku No Pico. \\n\\n\r\nSasha - AKA Potato Girl; A girl who like to eat a lot (because every anime needs to have a character who has a bad eating habit, such as Luffy from One Piece and Goku from Dragon Ball) or Usagi from Sailor Moon. The act of them constantly eating serves as a metaphor for their virginity or purity because if they can't get someone to stuff their hole for them they'll stuff the obvious one with food. Sasha is the lolcow of this anime and some fans theorize that she might be Polish because of how she acts before thinking and invented the parachute that opens on impact. \\n\\n\r\nYmir - selfish feminist bitch who only cares for her scissoring bitch friend Christa. \\n\\n\r\nAnnie - Lonely virgin insane blonde chick who can't make a proper friend to save her life. While demonstrating l33t skills in human form, as a Titan, she kills the others in the genocide legion for unknown reasons. She is currently worshiped by a bunch of idiots on /a/, while not only she has not appeared, but neither does the plot itself any good compare to a typical naruto chapter. Also is a hook nosed kike. \\n\\n\r\nJean - Typical Pussy ass f***ot who gets butthurt over seeing his friends getting pwned by the titans. He somehow manages to survive and instead of backing out of the action by joining the Military Police Brigade, he goes on ahead to the Survey Corps and tries to do as much as he can to beat the holy hell out of the giant drunk people.\\n\\n\r\nLevi - Droopy ass OCD ridden 1337 5k1llZ loner. Likes to f**k Eren up the ass with a broom handle every chance he gets. Eren likes it because he's a faggot and Mikasa wants to be asked to 3-way just so she can watch and take pictures. Levi is a favourite among the fangirls who desperately need an uninterested, detached, cold and abusive figure in their lives to buttrape them other than their step-father. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\r\nAttack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin if you're a weeaboo s**t eater) is unfortunately, extremely good at connecting with its intended audience, the majority of them being cheesy tumblr girls. The series has spawned countless fanfic, mostly involving the male characters from the series engaging in awkward sensual moments or boning each other, with fangirls soaking their pants on the first sight of those characters and their unoriginal quirks. Sound familiar? Attack on Titan managed to infect YouTube with its cheesy, pre-teen tier faggotry as well. Typing Attack on Titan will bring up tons of results mostly involving mash-ups and sexy orgasm inducing moments from the anime series. \\n\\n\r\nThe 16 year old horny girls who watch the show will refer to the main characters as their babies, fittingly so as all the main characters are faggot crybabies imagined to engage in acts of passion with each other as the story proceeds. The countless tumblr blogs about SNK contain so many gay innuendos and the characters being cutesy pussyf***ots that exposure to it will cause instant homosexuality upon the viewer. The show also remains one of the most overly cross-gender cosplayed show in existence as the weeaboo retards luv them some gender bending due to being uncomfortable with their own sexuality. The attraction of these fans proves the anime to be an effective one, and will hopefully help contain this massive trend from spreading to the more relevant parts of the internet. \\n\\n\r\nWanna tryhard and troll the fans? Tell them any of the following: \\n\r\n- Offer any type of homosexual relationship between characters. (Actually, f**k that, all the fangirls have come up with at least 100 cringe inducing Yaoi pairings so doing this is the equivalent to putting out fire with gasoline. Instead, humiliate them by telling them how retarded and hormone induced their pairings are. Don't forget to insult Tumblr while you're at it.)\\n\r\n- Refer to it as Attack of the Titans\\n\r\n- Tell them that Eren is the worst main character in all of shounen history\\n\r\n- Tell them that their endless speculation of plot points and character alignments are utterly pointless because the characters are extremely uninteresting and the series has as much of a plot as 2 girls 1 cup does\\n\r\n- Compare it to other running anime and explain why the latter is better\\n\r\n- Say that Berthholdt did nothing wrong\\n\r\n- Insist that Ymir any character is straight.\\n\r\n- Call the first opening song bad\\n\r\n- Call the second opening better\\n\r\n- Tell them that the show is extremely cheesy and hand-crafted to appeal to the pre-teen girls that watch the show, and is needlessly overacted\\n\r\n- Refer them to this review\\n\r\n- Make fun of the character deaths (this is especially effective since the death toll of dead German people is higher than Stalingrad.)\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan, also known as Stop F**king Crying, is an extremely cheesy, melodramatic and overhyped Japanese show, in which nearly everything dies before the viewer can figure out what the f**k is going on. Essentially the Game of Thrones of anime, the plot mainly revolves around people frenetically crying and shouting incoherently at each other literally non-stop. The tear to frame ratio is a million to half a frame. The protagonist is a wimpy loser virgin, so the viewer can more easily insert himself into the character. While the manga looks like it was drawn by a dyslexic suffering from muscular dystrophy, using his dick for a pencil, the anime shares the same s**tty CGI animation with the Berserk: Golden Age Arc film series (another s**tty Japanese show that no one heard of). Every episode consists of consecutive scenes of people struggling with their s**t that only you can relate to and ends with a cliffhanger, because when you're watching a show you always want to be reminded how much life sucks, that is pretty much compulsory. Despite the rumors that this anime was inspired by a viking myth, it really doesn't show any pillaging or raepfests, excluding the fanfic.\\n",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\r\nShingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan is by and far the most popular and hyped anime of the year 2013. It has received much praise from all sides of the anime community and it is usually agreed upon that it is at least a \u201cgood\u201d anime. Though the question is, is it overhyped?\r\nStory:- 7\r\n(a)Premise:\r\nThe story of SnK is one which, at first glance, doesn\u2019t show originality. It is a classic \u201czombie\u201d movie, just with the zombies being gigantic. The premise revolves around, gigantic man-eating creatures named \u201cTitans\u201d. These titans pose a gigantic threat to humanity\u2019s existence. Thus humanity creates 3 walls, whichprotect them from the titans, but for how long?\\n\r\nSoon the wall is broken and the first protective wall is abandoned. Here, we meet our 3 main characters, Eren, Mikasa and Armin. Eren has just lost his mother in the titan attack and swears vengeance against all titans.\\n\\n\r\n(b)Originality:\\n\r\nThus the story truly begins. I call this a non-original story since, there are many anime that have a post-apocalyptic world where humans are constantly under the threat of attack from an external source shrouded in mystery (Like Evangelion and Gurren Lagann). The story also revolves around the survival aspect that many anime use. But, it is here that the story stops being similar to other anime. The rest of the anime is completely original filled with plot twists in every other episode.\\n\\n\r\n(c)Pacing:\\n\r\nThe pace of SnK is \u201cweird\u201d. After the first few episodes there is a 3 year time skip, while later on in the series, there is an \u201carc\u201d which goes on for around 5-6 episodes, but takes place in 1 day.\\n\r\nThroughout the entirety of the series, it keeps the viewer exited for the next episode and keeps the story going at a ridiculously fast pace.\\n\\n\r\n(d)Ending:\\n\r\nThe ending of the series is extremely unsatisfactory. But as of now, a second season may be coming in 2015.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:- 9\\n\\n\r\n(a)Art:\\n\r\nThe art of SnK is of the best art in recent anime. The quality of the art is amazingly good, which is ironic, since the art in the manga wasn\u2019t that good. Every single human and area shown in the anime is extremely detailed. For example, the art style shown in the outer and middle wall shows the cities to be filled to the brim with buildings everywhere. While on the other hand we have the complete opposite in the inner wall, which shows an abundance of nature and beauty.\\n\\n\r\n(b)Animation:\\n\r\nThe animation in SnK is a gigantic step in animation for all of anime. Specifically the scenes which utilize the use of 3-D maneuver gear. The 3-D maneuver gear is basically a piece of equipment given to the soldiers which allows them to become spiderman. The animation in the scenes with the maneuver gear is brilliant. It gives a sense of actual movement to the viewer.\\n\r\nThe scenes with normal animation still seem very unique when compared to the animation style presented in other anime.\\n\\n\r\n(c)Character Design:\\n\r\nThe design of every human character is extremely unique and no character looks like a \u201cnormal\u201d anime character. Every character looks like an actual human would look. For example, unlike other main character of other (Shonen) anime, our main characters in SnK all have, average human bodies with average looking hair.\\n\r\nThe titan\u2019s designs on the other hand, degrade as the series goes on. At the beginning of the series, the titans all looked creepy, but as the series continues the titans go from creepy to borderline retarded. For example, in episode 5 we are introduced to a Moe Titan and a Darwin Titan.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:-9.5\\n\\n\r\n(a)OST or Soundtrack:\\n\r\nMasafumi Mima was the one who directed the soundtrack for Shingeki No Kyojin. His previous works were nothing worth mentioning, but his work for this soundtrack in particular, it masterful. Every song just screams the word \u201cepic\u201d into your ear while listening to the soundtrack.\\n\r\nEvery piece of music has german words thrown into it and uses choirs as an accompaniment for the lead music or singer.\\n\\n\r\n(b)Openings and Ending:\\n\r\nThere can only be one way to define the first opening of the series. Eargasm. The opening, on its own, has reached a higher hype level then the actual anime, which is saying a lot.\\n\r\nThe second opening is garbage when compared to the first one, but when heard on its own it is a pretty good song.\\n\r\nBoth endings of the series, while not terrible, are easily overshadowed by the 2 openings.\\n\\n\r\n(c)Sub and Dub:\\n\r\nThe subbed version of the series is more recommended than the dubbed in this case. It\u2019s not that the dub is bad, but the sub it\u2019s just better. The dub for SnK is fine, but Eren sounds ridiculously old for his age.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:-3\\n\\n\r\n(a)Main characters:\\n\r\nThe characters of SnK are the worst part of it. There is almost no development for any character aside from Armin.\\n\r\nEren is the stereotypical \u201crevenge junkie\u201d for anime and doesn\u2019t evolve any further than that.\\n\r\nMikasa is the main problem. She is extremely overpowered. Awesome, but overpowered. But here biggest flaw is her affection for Eren. Unlike characters like Levi, who are overpowered, but not overly affectionate, Mikasa has an unreal amount of love for Eren.\\n\r\nArmin is the only main character in the series that goes through any development. He goes from a weak character to a person who uses tact in battles.\\n\r\n(b) Supporting Cast:\\n\r\nThe supporting cast of SnK is mediocre at best. Some characters get little to no attention while other go through some development. Examples of a few good supporting characters in SnK are Sasha, Jean, Hange, Annie, Erwin and Levi.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:-8\\n\\n\r\nThe series as a whole was very enjoyable. It was a good shonen which was slow at some points. It keeps you on your toes by giving cliffhangers on every episode doing something like Code Geass achieved.  The soundtrack was epic and the animation was brilliant. The ending, while was unsatisfactory, made you excited for the next season.\\n\\n\r\nIs it overhyped? Maybe. That depends on your personal preference. It does praise, but definitely not as much as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes get your blood pumped up, the crappy character development will make you facepalm and the retarded titan designs will probably make you spit out your drink.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL= 7.2 out of 10\\n",

            "content": "Right off the bat, I have to admit; I have a distinct love for the \u2018dystopian world\u2019 genre. It\u2019s fascinating and something we may never be able to truly understand in the real world. The suffering, the agony and fear of being caged and suppressed\u2026it\u2019s not uncommon, but we definitely don\u2019t live behind 50-meter high walls and don\u2019t see giant naked humanoids eating our family and friends.\r\nThat is what makes Shingeki No Kyojin so amazing to me.\r\nThe storyline is very simple and easy to understand right from episode 1. \r\nThe overall revelation of the exact plot does not allow me to truly comment on itas the manga is still ongoing and I have not finished the manga myself. I do appreciate the anime production team\u2019s job on the whole aspect of suspense in almost every episode that relayed the true fear and tension from the story. As I\u2019ve said, it may not be easy for us to relate to running away from naked giants but the anime portrayed great emphasis on fear, anger and many other extreme emotions that just draws us in. I would be lying to say that I was not at the edge of my seat in every episode. There is also the involvement of the supporting characters which is something I personally enjoy. I really can\u2019t stomach when an anime or manga is ALL ABOUT the main character and that he/she is everything that the story is about \u2013unless, the title itself IS the protagonist\u2019s name. I just love to see the development of relationships amongst characters that adds up more depth into the story. I can\u2019t say much about the story in complete detail for I am placing my bets on a second season AND awaiting the true finale of the manga, however, I can definitely say that the anime itself did a great job in portraying the originality and raw emotion of the story which enables me to give a double thumbs-up.\\n\\n\r\nNow, here is where I want to elaborate on the most; the Art.\\n\r\nOh how Shingeki No Kyojin blew me away with the majestic animation and art. From the characters to the settings and the details of the animation made me breathless; especially when they portray the use of the 3D Maneuver Gears. Not only that, the lighting and use of slow-motion effects magnified the emotions and suspense of each scene. I am a freak for fine details because it is quite hard to see super-great detail in art styles of shounen-based anime/manga. However, I was not disappointed with Shingeki No Kyojin. It captured the essence of the story beautifully and not to mention the work and effort of the flawless animation. I just\u2026love it. I can\u2019t put my personal happiness in words enough because I just wish that there are more shounen animes with this kind of quality animation; especially for action scenes. Simple thick intense lines and sound effects are not enough to convey a perfect action scene\u2026it is the raw animation and movement of the characters captured frame by frame. That is why I appreciate the effort and work put onto this anime and the art is definitely one of my favourite aspects of this anime; hands down.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack used in this anime is just stunning. I personally downloaded the entire OST album to listen to all of its tracks and although some were just\u2026not all that great, there are certain ones that are beyond spectacular. Even by just listening to the background music, you can feel the sadness, melancholy and agony of the characters\u2026and at other times, it builds up the pace into a huge Titan kickass fight. It blends well with the setting and mood of the anime and stays true to its emotions. There are also certain songs that are just plain EPIC which\u2026I have to urge you to watch the anime itself to truly appreciate it. The two opening and ending sequences were also well chosen and in my personal opinion, I LOVED both of the openings\u2026they were amazing. The first opening song captured the main protagonist, Eren\u2019s resolve and anger towards the Titans which is basically the main thing happening in the anime and the second song is more of an evolution into a war-like aspect where you can truly catch onto the soldiers\u2019 resolution for humanity. All in all, I love the soundtrack used in this anime. Great job once again, production team!\\n\\n\r\nAh, the characters\u2026they can basically become the goldmine or garbage for an anime in my personal opinion. In this case, Shingeki No Kyojin is purely gold. Not saying that every character is awesome, I hated a few characters\u2026but that is the beauty of it. There is never a perfect character and in this anime, ALL the characters are flawed. In the dystopian setting, I think such characteristic is easily found in all of its characters and it makes the anime less\u2026boring? I don\u2019t know about most of you but I love it when an anime truly portrays the weaknesses of the characters. Sure, strength and power development is cool and all but it is the flaw that makes them more\u2026human and relatable in a sense. In every episode, you can see the characters in fear because\u2026that is how things are in a crazy dystopian world. There is no such thing as \u2018fearlessness\u2019 here. Even the strongest soldier shows confusion and indecisiveness but that might give out spoilers so I\u2019ll just leave it at that. Overall, I find the characters all beautifully made and well-thought out. And for once, I love how a supporting character is a lot more badass than the main protagonist\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to group up enjoyment and my overall thought of this anime into one and that is; simply EPIC. The anime does not showcase huge adventures and multiple crises; it\u2019s already IN one huge severe problem. I\u2019m just happy that there is still hope for epic animation in an anime because I\u2019ve been disappointed a lot with many shounen animes.  I\u2019m going to give this a 9/10 because I cannot say that this anime is PERFECTION. It is not. But it definitely is a winner in my heart and hopefully yours as well! =D\\n",

            "content": "I think it's safe to say that Shingeki no Kyojin is the most popular anime of 2013. Whilst I can see why people would be attracted to it and that it's a very entry-level anime, it's also a pretty mediocre show. \r\nLet's start by looking at this show as just an adaptation. So, ignoring the story, characters, etc. I'll just look at how well the manga has been adapted into an animated series. The artstyle is quite unique, it has a certain appeal to it and I quite like it (even if the quality of the artstyle suffers in the manga). Production I.G managed todo a nice job of preserving the good aspects of Isayama's work. However, when we come to animation, things seem to go downhill. I could write a book on how many very poor examples of animation there are in this show. From QUALITY drawings to a still frame being shaken around the screen with some wind effects over it in place of an actual action scene to purple bricks. The bottom line is the animation is rushed, cheap and poorly done. There ARE some good examples, sometimes whole episodes go by with very few issues, but other weeks it'll be god-awful. The inconsistencies in quality leave a bitter taste and I would have to call the animation, overall, average. Having taken a look at some comparisons between the BDs and TV releases, the BDs seem to have improved on the QUALITY moments quite a bit. Those comparisons were cherry-picked, however, and I\u2019m not going to re-watch the series to adjust my review for the BDs. All I can say is that if you want to waste your time on this series, you might as well try watch the BDs. \\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, another major aspect of a manga adaptation, I think they did a decent job here. In fact I think the OST carries entire episodes sometimes. The OPs and EDs are pretty great, and never fail to get fans hyped for the show. I'm no music geek, so I find it quite hard to express what I thought of a soundtrack in a review, but the music for battle scenes fits quite well and made up for some of the poor (or complete lack of) animation in some scenes. However, only a couple of tracks are memorable, so I'm not going to call the OST great. \\n\\n\r\nDirection and pacing are truly the worst parts of this adaptation. 4 episodes to move a boulder speaks for itself, but I'll mention all the filler later on.\\n\\n\r\nNow leaving the adaptation-specifics to one side and looking at something that crosses both forms of media, the story. I think this show has a decent plot. In fact, the premise is really great and I think that's how the show got so popular - it has a very interesting premise. All of humanity trapped inside giant walls that protect them from the horrific titans outside, and finally the titans break down the wall? Pretty cool. It's a shame, however, that this premise was somewhat wasted. Once the show gets to the boulder arc, it just starts to lose its appeal and becomes very generic and shonen-y with TONS of filler. Seriously, there is an amazing amount of filler in this series and I struggle to comprehend how more people aren't complaining about it. Maybe it's because they've organised the filler in such a way that it's less noticeable to the teenage audience? This is the general formula for the show: Up to 3 minutes of recapping what you already know, the OP, 15 minutes of sweet FA and dragged out speeches, 2 minutes of something happening, the ED, then a preview for next week. It never fails to leave the only interesting part until the last couple of minutes, then just cuts off so you have to come back next week for your weekly dose of filler. In fact, they hinder the actual show by forcing each and every episode to end with some sort of cliff-hanger. It would be a lot smoother and better if they didn't force this every single week.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the story, besides the premise it's nothing that special and has a rather large amount of plot holes and things happening for nothing other than plot convenience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Characters. Characters. Wow, it's amazing how two-dimensional they all are. Besides the changes characters go through early on in the series, there is 0 character development. Almost everyone is the exact same cardboard cut-out they were to begin with. The main character is nothing more than 'hurr must kill muh titans!' and the female lead is nothing more than 'hurr must save muh not-brother-pseudo-boyfriend!'. It gets very boring, very quickly. Jean is the most interesting character and has the most believable development, why isn't he the main character instead? Supporting characters are usually pretty bad and I've never felt anything when someone died. This isn't because I'm a heartless monster, it's because trying to empathise with ANYONE from this series is similar to trying to empathise with a brick wall. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarise, the lead cast are some variation of Mary Sue (albeit Eren fucks up 24/7 and is just generally retarded) who have a shitload of plot armour whilst almost everyone else doesn't matter and dies. The plot and characters follow so many shonen tropes and cliches that leave me feeling that this show wasted so much good potential. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show can have its enjoyable moments. The plot is generally interesting, but falls really short with its characters. I can see why the show got popular due to its premise, and I can see why it remained popular and why people like it. However, this show is simply just not that good and is seriously overrated. The last few episodes, whilst good, did not make up for the countless time wasted throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\n5/10 - would recommend you read the manga instead to avoid as much filler if you were really wanting to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr average and overhyped :\u00ac)\\n",

Since I have rewatched this anime probably more then 6 times so far I believe I have the right to say the art and animation of the anime was probably one of the best I have ever seen. The incredibly smooth and spirited action scenes were very well made, not to mention the music which fit the animations almost perfectly and made it seem even more intense and absolutely stunning. Although there were many plotholes that I expect all to be covered in the next season, well that is if there is one, the anime itself was extraordinary and very well made I highly enjoyed this anime and it definitely has reached my top 10, I also find it very amazing how an anime with only 25 episode is up to par with all the other mainstream and ultimately popular anime like naruto.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nArt:10/10\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nOverall:9/10\\n",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin, is simply like weed. It circulates your body, into a powered-up mechanism of charisma dwelling from the sprawling adrenaline of anticipation pumped into the human body. A constantly hyped anime viraling throughout the anime community, and whether or not this anime is critiqued or loved, an anime is an anime and thus will forever be ingrained firmly into anime history and Japanese culture regardless. Question is, is this a masterpiece? or is it merely an over-hyped and generically produced show of the 2013 year? or perhaps, is it ambiguous towards every individual? \r\nPrimarily, Shingeki no Kyojin (will refer as snk from nowon) at first with exceptional hype was seemingly latent. Meaning, just from the first episode of Snk, the potential of Snk was already evident towards the audience, and you know, it is going to be a well-recognized and decent anime.  \\n\\n\r\nStory 9~\\n\\n\r\nSnk portrays the world of humanity in an almost dystopian state where humans are on the verge of extinction, where humanity is engraved within walls and restrictions, and where humanity is deemed into living with fear and agony as inferior existences amidst the superior entity also known as the 'Titans'. Although humans being more intellectual, the titans excelled in their large physical state. The show conveys how much despair humanity is left to face in order to strive and thrust for their freedom and entrapment. Definitely a marathon-able anime to say the least, it is addicting and extremely entertaining to say the least, and this addiction will only you make you strive for more when the show comes to an end.  \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is fine throughout the anime although a bit slower in the middle, the effects are brought out nicely as our supporting cast receive more screen time, such as Levi and Jean. Eren, after witnessing grief and despair, finds himself with the need to achieve a change for humanity, a change where humanity will be free from the walled city, a change where humanity can see every individual with smiles on their faces, and a change where mankind will be able to explore the rest of the unexplored lands awaiting them. \\n\\n\r\nAfter years of training, Eren, Mikasa and Armin pursue their inevitable goal of protecting humanity and as for Eren, \"to kick the Titans' ass\". \\n\\n\r\nArt 9~\\n\\n\r\nI would summarize the animation and art with three words. Pretty top notch. \\n\r\nAnimated by Production I.G, a producer known to have previously released other several high quality works and excelling in animation, from characters to the backgrounds to the action scenes, I can definitely claim this superb. The characters are well highlighted with thick black borders, making the audience able to easily distinguish the backgrounds from the characters while helping us understand these characters more as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe titans are depicted comically and uniquely, their faces are indescribable beauty and it is hilarious to the extent you would feel like bursting with laughter or at least laughing within you. However, a potential problem for some viewers would be that these crudely drawn faces can cause serious action and intense scenes into becoming scenes of where humour is seemed to be forcefully implemented into. Nevertheless, these faces kept us entertained and ultimately did not ruin many viewers enjoyment and expectations including me and did not have that much of an impact. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9~\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, to say the music fits the anime at times is an understatement. Sound is excelled in Snk and is superb, having appropriate music to approach their required scenes in order to acquire and release their full wanted effects. Snk used euphonious, emotional and sympathetic soundtracks to hit on the dramatic and emotional scenes our characters experience. Ranging from a fusion of electronic, orchestral and rock type music, soundtracks such as \"Bauklotze\" and \"Call your name\" are examples of highly recognizable soundtracks of rock erupted adrenaline embedded into our veins and pumping our eagerness to watch the show. It keeps your feet on the floor, and your body sitting up straight. With Guilty Crown, Kill La Kill and Ao no Exorcist soundtrack composer Hiroyuki Sawano, I can ensure you that you will be leeched tightly onto your chair.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening prepares you with eagerness for what you are going to experience in the episode while the ending leaves that experience as a memory forever stained into your mind, wanting to see more.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8~\\n\\n\r\nOne of the three main characters in Snk is Eren, the \"boss\" or \"shounen leader\" of the crew consisting of Mikasa and Armin and Friends. He is placed on a vocation to pursue the retribution on the titans due to the death of his loved ones and for humanity's thrust for freedom. This boy can be considered a raging nuisance, but that being said, this is what makes him intriguing as a character as throughout the show, we are put into his shoes to experience his physical and psychological pain he endured throughout his journey. \\n\\n\r\nNext, Armin, at first being depicted as a pussy who would never takes the initiative and stand up for himself, having no absolute or firm resolve, he is shown to be weak and looks up to Eren his best friend from childhood. As a result, after walking the same path as Mikasa and Eren, he is shown to grow and develop as a character in his areas of determination and bravery, excelling and being of much use in the tactical and strategical field in battles.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the one and only Mikasa. The epitome of flawless perfection, one of the reasons why I watch this show is simply Mikasa. She is \"Shingeko no Kyojin\" in a nutshell. Being physically strong and intelligent in combat, she is also notably and essentially one of the reasons why Eren wants to conquer the titans and she wants to ultimately, protect Eren as well, being her adopted loving brother and taking care of her when she did not have a home. \\n\r\nIn pure opinion, I believe these characters were developed quite well, but it was possible to develop them to a deeper extent, exploring their personal background. The supporting crew of Snk is phenomenal, why? There is Levi and if I were you, lets just say if you piss him off, you won't have a very bright tomorrow. :D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9~and Overall 9\\n\\n\r\nThe show to conclude kept me leeched, and It definitely has a gripping and well written story to accompany the fluid animation, art and epic soundtrack, all contributing into driving your blood inside your veins around your body. After watching Snk, I really have no idea if I am human anymore, the thrill of Snk has made me sub-human and so I will have to stop writing now. Snk will always be remembered when the anime community reflects on 2013 as a year, and we will then recognize how much anime has changed throughout the years, be it years, decades or centuries.\\n",

Generally, it is a class on which the author wants to focus on. But there is one more genre which we as viewers create, which I nomenclate as the epicness genre. It is a genre which can include animes from any other genres, may be from rom com, to horror to psychology. It is a genre reserved for the best of best animes we have watched till date, and is obviously not the same for everyone. Still there are numerous animes which haveuniversal appeal and get into this genre in everyone's list, a few eg. would(could) be death note, or code geass, or hxh. So is Shingeki no Kyojin probably the vest anime 2013 one of them? If yes its incredible, if no then what did it lack? \u00a0A good start is half done, but that also means half is remaining to be done.\\n\\n\r\nSo is there anything that makes it different from other animes? Snk is set in a medieval period, where titans attack the humans or may be the other way around. Humans use weapons like cannons, guns and 3D gear, to fight against them. Obviously our protagonist losses people precious to him and wants revenge. That is what I originally thought, and it is probably a stagnated thought in many minds, but the fact is that the protagonist EREN fights for a broad goal like freedom, not for a narrow minded aim as revenge. So he trains himself and tries to fight. The action scenes are decent and nicely animated, and are added with the best osts. Apart from this there is one more thing that this anime has and that is REALISM. Action, shounen anime and realism can't go hand in hand, but this anime manages the impossible. Ok so are titans real? Answer is yes and no. No for obvious reasons. Yes from a very scientific point of view, I am not a biology student, but I do know there existed dinosaurs, and consider titans to be dinosaurs with brains and human faces we are done. And let them be a hybrid between a \u00a0dinosaur and a regenerative animal, so they can regenerate. Moreover there is the 3D gear, and in between the episodes, on screenshots, there is a whole description on how it works, and it is very scientific, and needs skilled users to handle it. And the feeling of despair, and the reactions of common people under this, and the psychology behind their actions is also well explored. Above all it removes many side characters very easily, which is a rarity in many current shounen animes, in fact they resurrect the dead. All this simply adds to the realism factor.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 9/10, Sound 11/10\\n\r\nProduction IG maintained good visuals, with incredible animations, except for a few parts where they used the same picture again and again. But still on the whole it sets a fairly decent mark on its animation due to incredible action scenes, and some cool characters (Mikasa is a beauty dont disagree on that now). The medieval period is shown nicley, the scenery and backgrounds all add to the decent animation. The exact reactions and facial descriptions when the characters suffered from despairity, were very well animated. Sound and music are one of the best of all the anime osts I have listened to. The osts are godly epic, and this ain't any exaggeration and it is probably the osts that make even simple scenes, so lively that the viewer is glued to the screens. It emphasizes that incredible osts can literally lift the enjoyment to another level. Moreover the voice acting is fabulous. Sorry Kaji Yukii haters, but his role as Eren is the one of the best voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10 Minor spoilers\\n\r\nStory is fairly simple, titans attack humans attack titans some get killed, some get injured ,some live some die in the name of a soldier (this is quoted from samurai champloo opening, samurai is replaced by soldier). But all that is for the first arc. The second arc delves into mystery too. It is strictly not classified as a mystery genre, but it still has fair amount of it but it is mostly implicative. The story has some distinct features absent from many of its counterparts. Most people believe that the story is partly new and stuff, but its most distinctive characteristics is that it brings out the filth within the humans. It also questions things such as right to\u00a0freedom, and the need for power, and the ability to make precise decisions. The main story follows Eren and his friends who strive \u00a0to survive (or may be not?). One of the strongest points of the story is that it is able to remove any side characters who are not needed without any second thought, so plz dont get to \u00a0like nay side character, else u will be largely disappointed.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc mainly depends on action scenes, with few unpredictable situations. It mainly depended on the cliffhangers. \u00a0In fact the first arc had a lot many cliffhangers, and I was unable to sleep for two nights after one of the cliffhangers. So this mostly had a universal appeal. It has overall a very dark atmosphere and the author displays the despair within humans in an indigenous manner. As such the first arc deserves easy 10/10.\\n\r\nThe second arc was entirely different. With many new characters, it also started to have a mystery tone to it. And this probably backfired for many viewers as they started pointing out that the mystery was lame, whereas the real fact is that it was never meant to create any mystery, it was just to add suspense, and more importantly create tension for the climax. The author cleverly laid down facts so that the viewer knows the answer to the puzzle and just waits for the characters to understand and play it, but unfortunately it was misunderstood by many of us. Another aspect of this arc was irregular pacing, it would have been better to delete or merge one or two episodes and the let the climax reached earlier, and this followed by speculations to the next arc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u00a09/10\\n\r\nSince the anime follows the life\u00a0of soldiers it is obvious that it will cover many characters. So firstly the trio Eren, Mikasa, Armin. At first Eren is showed to be fighting for revenge, but then he develops into a character who puts freedom first, and that is what fuels his ambition. Later in the story he mostly develops into a cliche character of a regular shounen anime, but that is a law rather than exception. His development is done most intricately, and his experiences fuel this. Mikasa, the adoptive sister of eren, the star of the academy, is shown to be overly possesive about eren, but once her backstory is shown, it becomes completely understandable. She is shown to be superskilled, and is one of my favourite characters. Armin a kid, who becomes an incredible character later. He gets an awesome character development, and also plays the role of a narrator. He is a keen observant, and he is the one who makes many statements, which lead the viewers to a definite conclusion. He also quotes cool lines and was very impressive and bold in the latter half. Apart for the trio, there are MC's friends who are typical of a shounen anime. And the boss of all characters LEVI, who becomes a very important part in second arc, is mostly supported by his reputation, and his character is well defined and needs no further development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 11/10\\n\r\nFor me enjoyment is measured at two levels. First, general satisfaction. Second, my reactions to cliffhangers. I heavily enjoyed the anime and the sole reason for this is that I watched it as an ongoing anime. Other reason would be the first impression of the anime, and second reason would be awesome osts. Third and the most important reason would be a completely different class of shounen. In which shounen anime have we ever seen people getting eaten up and actually dying, I. Fact I wonder whether this should be classified as a shounen. I attribute its success to the incredible tension.\\n\r\nMost SNK haters comprise of people who either marathoned the series in a day or two, or may be week at its most. The whole of the second arc depends upon the tension created in 4-5 eps, and the climax at its peak. Many lost the vast tension because it takes time for the intense pressure created to be fitted into viwers mind. In fact they lost the most crucial part. So I honestly suggest one to watch the anime in regular gaps. For me it was one week, which is impossible because u will most probably surrender to ur conscience to watch what happens next, but still I would suggest at least a gap of three days between any two episodes, to gain maximum enjoyment. The brain dissects all facts carefully and this is the path for full enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nAnother trick is to watch the anime in HD, it looks as if the Titan came out of the screen. HD rocks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nSo the question still bugs did this get into everyone list of epicness genre? The answer is yes and no. For me it did, for others it might not. I was forced to watch this on a weekly basis, and with no new eps, I irrationally rewatched the previous episodes. In fact I watched the first arc probably 3 times. With each new episode, there was a general satisfaction. All the episodes served a purpose and rarely any episode was wasted. The author has carefully planned the outline, and the anime adheres very much to the manga. But as I already mentioned, the problem which occurrs when u marathon a series, u dissolve and nullify the huge tension, leaving a dull taste.\\n\\n\r\nCons : On complete objective viewing, there are few plot holes in the story, but this can be easily overlooked, and these will be probably covered in the later chapters of the manga. Animation though consistent, had a few backdrops, but on the whole it is at a very good level. Characters like erens mom and dad, and his friends could have got a bit more development with their back stories. As for the episodes, one or two scenes could have been deleted or fast forwarded to reach the climax early, leaving us with speculations of what's next. Given all these cons I can at most kill up one point leaving a close masterpiece at 9/10.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note: I never intended to write a review on SNK, for I assumed that this would get plenty of 10s as it's review, but the hell, it barely got 9. What is to happen of the next generation of anime viewers if they were to miss out on this epic shit.\\n",

It felt like they took 2 episodes longer than they should have to do something. The story had an interesting concept but the final work was messy. They could have had the anime last longer into the manga but the pacing ruined it. They jumped from idea to idea to fast and then took to long to finish it.\r\nCharacters 6/10\r\nThe character Eren was kinda eh he makes the show kinda annoying. It kindaended up like he cry'd and never got anything done. Mikasa on the other hand was a new thing and was very interesting to see how she would act. I liked how she was so focused about protecting Eren.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 Sound 9/10\\n\r\nThe overall art and sound was great. The scenes where they had the 3d gear on they animated the background very well. The art had good fitting to the show. The music was also fantastic.

You become attached toliterally all the characters (except Armin at first) and the show is super messed up by just having characters introduced and to die in the next moment like swatting a fly.

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin, better known as Attack on Titan, is at the moment the third most popular anime on MyAnimeList. But does it really deserve all the attention it's getting? \r\nNot in our opinion. \"Shingeki no Kyojin a 6/10?\" Yes, it could have been so much more than it was. Read all about our reasons in our review.\r\n~Story~ 5/10\r\nThe plot had a lot of potential, however this show is the definition of 'wasted potential'. The second cours of the series wasn't half as good as the first one. We assume you all already know what happens in this anime, because pretty much everyone on MALhas already seen it (unless you've been living under a rock). So we're not going to tell you everything that happened, but we're going to stress the parts that we liked and the parts that we did not like. The story starts (for those 0,0001% who haven't seen this anime: spoiler alert) when enormous Titans invade the city where our main characters live. One of them then eat the mother of our main-main character. The entire audience already knew the mother so well, and everyone was so attached to her... oh wait. We only knew her for about 17 minutes. So it had close to no impact on the audience. The only person who was impacted was our teen-angsty main character, who becomes even more angsty in the progress (\"must... kill... all the titans!\"). Our heroes decide to join the Survey Corps and there they meet lance corporal Levi, arguably the best character of this show (at least he was in our opinion). For about 4 episodes we watch the struggle of mankind against the way stronger and overpowered Titans. But then... plot twist! Our teen-angsty main character somehow acquires the power to turn into a Titan. This ruined basically all battle scenes for us, as they became predictable and boring (our human-titan would always be able to win somehow). The struggle of mankind against the way stronger Titans turned into the struggle of our protagonist against another human Titan. Who could that be? Anyone with more than one brain cell could see, after about three seconds, who she was. Of course we're talking about our beloved Female Titan (spoiler alert) Annie-chan and of course it took our heroes 10 episodes to figure it out. This is exactly why we didn't enjoy the second half of the series in the least, because it became oh so predictable. The second season of this series is due to come out this year (if it isn't going to be delayed again) so we can't say much about the ending yet. Except for the fact that it's very open.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThis series has an awesome first half, but it collapsed in the second one. It collapsed like Wall Maria collapsed because of the power of the Armored Titan. Also, the 'mystery' of the Female Titan was plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 8/10\\n\r\nWe can all agree that the art in this anime was beyond awesome. It was very modern, and the battle scenes were very graphic and realistic. Also, we loved the animation of the 3DMG. There's nothing much we can remark on this aspect of the show, except for the fact that it was awesome. \\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe art in this show was amazing.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ 8/10\\n\r\nSie sind das Essen und wir sind die J\u00e4ger... I think even a reasonable amount of non-anime watchers have heard this sentence at some point in their life. And of course we love the opening as well. It was epic, bombastic and fitted the show. The second opening (which sadly got a lot of hate because it replaced the first one) was great in our opinion as well. The endings weren't that special, but they worked. The OST's in this show were amazing. We loved the battle music (e.g. The Reluctant Heroes, Vogel I'm Kafig). So again, nothing of importance that was bad about the sound.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThis show has some awesome soundtracks and openings. There wasn't anything special about the endings, but it would have been more bothersome if the OST's were annoying, as those are the soundtracks you listen to when watching the anime. Luckily, they were awesome.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ 3/10\\n\r\nSo this is the aspect where the show is really weak. Let's start with our protagonist, Eren Jaeger, as we already said, the angstiest teenager ever. His life goal is to destroy all the titans and, ironically enough, he becomes a Titan himself. This could have led to him struggling with his beliefs, but instead he used it as his advantage. There was some logic behind this, but the directors could have done a lot more than this. He is a bland, angsty protagonist, and in our opinion, one of the worst characters in the show. Then there is Mikasa, the overpowered adopted sister (who of course has a sad backstory as well) of our protagonist, and with a little bit of training she manages to become stronger than soldiers who have been fighting titans for way longer than she has. Why? Because plot convenience and tragic backstory powers. She also has a crush on our bland protagonist. She is an overpowered love interest, nothing more and nothing less. But sadly enough for her, Eren has more interest in killing titans. What a pity.\\n\r\nThen there's Armin, a smart but weak whiny best friend. He gets a proper amount of character development, and he's by far the best written character of the three main characters. It's just that he is very cliche, we've never seen a character like him before in a show... right? And then there is Levi. Levi is just epic. But not epic in an overpowered way, like Mikasa. Jean Kirchstein, who has a rivalry with Eren, which isn't a cliche either. Oh, and then there's Annie, whom we actually don't know much about, except for the fact that she's the Female Titan. Last but not least, there's Marco. But he wasn't half as good developed as he could have been. Haha.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe main three characters were poorly written, unoriginal and bland. A few of the side characters were pretty interesting, but the ones who really were, didn't get a lot of screen time. Good job writers.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 7/10\\n\r\nThis show is about humans killing enormous monsters with some sort of advanced bungeejumping ropes. Of course we enjoyed this. It was epic, but superficial. If you look into this show deeper, you'll find out that it doesn't go that deep. The story and characters were bland and poor, but the fights, background music and of course the art were great. It's certainly not as good of a show as some people make it out to be, but it definitely isn't as bad as some other people state it is. So if you want a simple show with some epic fights: look no further.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe show is superficial, but still enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nNo, this show isn't worth the title of 3rd most popular anime on MAL. But it certainly is an enjoyable show with awesome art and sound. If the characters had some proper development, this show could have been a lot better. Peace.",

            "content": "The old \"monsters have invaded so let's kill them all\" story. At first you might be turned off by the concept of the plot, but things quickly pick up and get very interesting. There's an element of mystery that AoT revolves around; if you like a good mystery, the world AoT is set in is very unique and there are many unexpected twists and turns. I'd describe the mood of the show as mostly grim, fearful, and intense. The story really does cover a wide set of emotions; the show seems to consistently use the theme of the 'human experience' as a way of tellingthe story. If I had to say something bad about AoT it would be that lines can get repetitive. While character models are animated nicely, they don't quite impress while motionless. If I had to say something good about AoT it would easily be the voice acting. Its unusual for such a large cast to have consistently good VA's, (especially for a serious show) AoT does a magnificent job in that area. Characters are great across the board, there's a great diversity of personalities and unique backstories that make this story one of a kind. Art and animation are very well done, the combination of highly detailed backgrounds and less detailed characters is able to create very fluid animated movements that are exciting and pleasing to the eye. Animation is lightning fast and very intense, the show rarely disappoints in that area. Music has an exciting tempo to it that can often draw you into the world at war theme. The plot has a nice way of building up and has many good unexpected twists. Favorite character: Armin. I give it a 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nTLDR Version: Great dramatic action and cast. Mysterious plot and nice setting.",

These \"holes\" in the plot will be filled in during the next season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave it a 10/10 because the art is amazing. From the first episode, I fell in love with the way the titans were drawn. It wasn't incredibly scary, but it was rather creepy. In Japanese, I would say kimochiwarui, which is a mix between creepy, weird and gross.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend you watch the first episode at least, and see if you like it. The story will escalate a lot from the first episode.",

            "content": "I feel like writing this review can go down in two ways. I either end up castrated by AOT's loyal but crazy fans for not giving it a 10 or People try to listen to some helpful criticism that the show can improve upon. I don't think that this show is the greatest show ever made but I also disagree with the people who think it's absolute garbage. It definitely ain't no Fairy Tail that's for sure.  This is an depth analysis of what AOT does particularly well in and where some of it's faults lie.\r\nPROS:\r\n1.CONCEPT/ATMOSPHERE\r\nWhat the show does exceedingly well in is it'soverall concept and atmosphere. The concept of zombies walking among us is a very popular and entertaining idea. Although, over the past 5 years or so it's begun to lose a lot of it's steam due to how much it was overused. For me personally, I've never been a big fan of zombies. There just brainless clones who add nothing to the overall plot (look to the Walking Dead as an example). Here however, there are 15 meter intelligent monsters roaming around. We become the bottom of the food chain, us humans are mere ants to these monsters. The f*cked up facial expressions of the titans is an act of pure genius. The titans don't fade into the background like zombies would, they CREATE the atmosphere and keep us feeling enclosed and helpless in our tiny little towns.\\n\\n\r\n2.PREMISE\\n\r\nThe first few episodes of the show are all excellent. In just 5 episodes, I felt hopeful, depressed, angry, sympathetic, relieved and utterly terrified. When an anime can do this, you know you've found a keeper. It's compelling and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the most part.\\n\\n\r\n3.ANIMATION/SOUNDTRACK\\n\r\n Not to mention it's spectacular animation, from 2 titans fighting to the death or zip wiring from building to building like Spiderman, it's animation is leaps and bounds ahead of any other anime that's for sure. Mix this with an excellent soundtrack and you've got some of the most entertaining moments in anime.\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n1.FORMAT/STRUCTURE OF PLOT\\n\r\nThe problems that I came to find in AOT usually go unnoticed because it's mesmerizing animation keeps you distracted. Somewhere along the way ( roughly around episode 10) the pacing of the show starts to slack quite a bit. However, I will not dedicate this review to talking about the pacing as it is common knowledge at this point. I will however talk about the plot's main objective for the first season. The goal that is set up from the begining of the show is as straight forward as it gets. Get to Eren's basement as it will \"solve everything, it will all finally make sense cliche\". This is fine and all but wait did we get to the basement? Is it because a certain manga has reached that point either? Well, guess what? I don't care. An anime should be able to stand on its own two feet. Just like a tv show doesn't need it's book material all the time ( Game of Thrones). The goal was set up for the first season but was left unresolved and now continues to the second season. A manga can do this, an anime cannot.\\n\\n\r\n2. KEPT IN THE DARK/PREDICTABILITY\\n\r\nThis brings me to my next point: it's absolute refusal to tell us ANYTHING. Now don't get me wrong, I love theories as much as the next guy. But, when a show tells you nothing but clues and possibilities, you feel like someone's scooped out your eyeballs with a spoon. Even in the final episode, when we think we'll learn SOMETHING, it completely f*cks us over and says,\"Maybe in 3 years time, guys. Not like it matters anyway cause you'll keep crawling back for more\". And we will. Every single time, you assholes. I also found the \"twists\" to be quite predictable. Like you can tell by just LOOKING at them if you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\n3.CHARACTERS\\n\r\nPossibly my least favorite aspect of the show is it's characters. The three main are okay at best but fail to really stand out. Eren, is your typical hot headed teenage boy who feels life is unfair. Not to mention his extreme psychopath tendencies. The kid seriously needs to visit Dr.Phil or something, cause I always get this creepy vibe off of him. PRO TIP: NEVER listen to Bryce Pappenbrook's horrible english version of Eren. Don't ask.\\n\\n\r\nMikasa annoys me to an even greater extent. She is made out to have literally zero faults and is absolutely perfect at everything. People seem to think she's the best female character of all time, give me Motoko from Ghost in the Shell anyday.  The fact that she is untouchable on the battlefield only disintegrates the danger of the world and makes it look like a cheesy story of heroism instead of the gritty and dark world it is. With her past being a typical \"boy saves girl and gives her a home cliche\" also downgrades her character. Then there's Armin, who is the kid who's bad at fighting but incredibly intelligent. Do the writers think that being insanely intelligent is more humane than being insanely good at fighting? The answer is no as both are as unrealistic as the other.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters, they only appear when it's necessary to remind you of their existence. Some are good like Jean but others like Ymir have me wondering, \"who the f*ck are you?\". The show has become notorious for killing it's characters mercilessly. A fact that is untrue unless you are supporting characters. Oh, and if you're Marco. Then you're f*cked. When you start asking yourself \"who the hell are these people the show keeps saying are dead?\" It can really show it's lack of focus on it's supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI realize that this may look like a whole heartily hate this show. This is untrue as I do think this show is GOOD and definitely not bad. I just believe it has A LOT OF POTENTIAL and can be so much more than just GOOD if it just fixes these faults next season. With it's excellent concept, animation and soundtrack, it needs to work on it's format of plot for each season, give us something to work off, add more depth to main and especially supporting characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview: Chances are if you watch, or know anyone who watches anime, you've heard of this one. Shingeki no Kyojin (or Attack on Titan) got crazy popular extremely quickly, and it's really no surprise why: the animation is absolutely beautiful, and the story picks up with a frantic pace right off the bat. However, despite this amazing introduction, there are significant flaws holding this anime back from being a masterpiece.\r\nStory: 30/37\r\nThe actual story of Shingeki no Kyojin is... well, a lot better than it sounded to me at first. While the idea of mankind being held in check by some alien force is not inany way new, this series handles it extremely well, and really can make you paranoid at times. That is to say, the titans, for the most part, really do feel threatening. Unfortunately, there are some major pacing issues in this anime. Shingeki no Kyojin starts out pretty fast paced, while still giving you adequate information to understand what's going on. That's not easy to do, and it does that very well. However, after the first half of the \u201cfirst season\u201d, things go downhill. There are some great moments scattered throughout the episodes filling up the middle and latter sections of season one, but there just aren't enough to justify how slow some things seem to get done. Fortunately, this is remedied towards the end of season one with the introduction of a few great characters, and some key story-line points that, actually, make a lot of sense and are well done. However, season two continues this offense by starting out great, ending good, but not having good meat in between point A and point B. The idea is that all humans are confined to one massive city surrounded by three circular walls, with parts of the city in between each wall. This being said, the area of this really can't be that massive, and when, in season 2, they announce what their goal is, it feels pretty easily accomplished. However, in the remaining 10 episodes of the season, they never even get reasonably close to reaching this, and instead are sidetracked, although I will admit that at least the sidetracking is important and relatively well done. If this review is making me sound like I hate the story, I don't. I think it's one of the better stories as well as good story-telling for MOST of it, but there are just some parts that feel extremely rushed or extremely slow, for little to no reason.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 23/37\\n\r\nWell, here is the single reason I don't like this show that much, and it shows by how many points are being docked. I would be lying if I said there weren't any fantastic characters in Shingeki no Kyojin, because most of the side characters are good, Mikasa Ackerman, one of the three main characters, is fantastic, and everyone's favorite: Captain Levi is also a great character. Unfortunately, this possibly good total cast is absolutely ruined by the main character of the series: Eren Yeager. Now, I have watched a lot of Slice of Life genre anime, and many of those are known for having awful, dense, un-interesting male leads, but Eren Yeager is in his own league. At lesat characters like King Joffrey from Game of Thrones are fun to hate. They are genuinely amazing parts, just evil characters. Eren is not fun to hate. He's annoying, constantly feels like he needs to get angry at everything, and thinks he's just going to do whatever he wants whenever he wants. It's absolutely childish and painful to watch. To make matters worse, the third of the trio of main characters, Armin is also annoying and whiny. Granted, both of these characters get SLIGHTLY better, but I will never be able to think of either of them as anything but annoying bitches unless some serious development goes down. As if all of this isn't enough, the worst part about it all is that the third main character, the female lead is absolutely great, and always goes out of her way to help Eren out of his own messes. And what does she get? Not a SINGLE, not ONE, thank you for the entire 26 episode series. Eren just brushes it off like he's entitled to her and deserves nothing less than to be pampered by his loyal friend. Enough about Eren though, the rest of the characters are pretty good. The aforementioned Mikasa Ackerman is a very good character, as well as Levi, once he's introduced that is. There are other great ones, but none worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 25/25\\n\r\nHonestly, if I put more of an emphasis on animation quality than character development (which, in my opinion, would be pretty dumb), Shingeki no Kyojin would receive a vastly different score. For every flaw in character quality, the art and sound makes up for it. This series has by far the best soundtrack in anime, and has probably the best animation I have ever seen, even trumping the June 2014 anime that I am currently watching. I cannot say enough good things about the animation quality, sound or art, so I won't, and I'll let you see how awesome it is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRomance: 0/1\\n\r\nThis section is basically whether or not there was a romance that I enjoyed. Sorry if this is a spoiler, but I particularly enjoy watching a romance develop, and I wished that other reviews would tell me if I was going to get to see one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 78/100\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin rubs me the wrong way, so take this score with a grain of salt, but I think that the show is incredibly over-rated and needs to get the Sword Art Online treatment a bit. Everything about it is so awesome... except arguably the single most important things such as good pacing, or even bearable characters. If you can get past the main character, Eren Yeager, you will most likely enjoy this show vastly, as that alone would probably add 10 points onto the score.\\n\\n\r\nDeductions in points from the score are my attempt at being as objective as I can, but they will be listed here in case anyone reading this cares more or less about anything I take points away from:\\n\\n\r\n-The story has some minor, but still jarring pacing issues, and there are some parts that don't feel well put together\\n\r\n-Eren Yeager is an atrocious character, and never should have existed let alone as a male lead.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my review (or want to talk about anything at all, really), feel free to email me at: nickwillis64@gmail.com\\n",

            "content": "Oh how I know I'm going to be going against the masses with this review. When I first watched AOT I was intrigued. What an interesting notion: the decline of humanity, being forced to live like caged animals behind massive walls to be safe from massive human-eating beings.....and that's where all of the good stopped for me.\r\nFirst off, we have the three main characters: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin.\r\nEren (aka - mr. grumpy-pants who never stops yelling) seems to be an ideal character at the beginning, but as we move onwards through the series....where is the character development?! Come on!!\r\nMikasa, is literally ms. perfect in everyway. It seems this girl can do no wrong. She can do everything without even batting an eyelash. Enough said - irritating character due to her perfection. News flash - nobody should be perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArmin is the best out of the three by far. He's the classic bookworm. I don't have pretty much anything bad to say about him. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that really irritated me was that this is pretty much a military anime about fighting gigantic titans. The characters are in an ARMY and yet, they're disobeying orders left and right and I don't think that they were ever punished for doing so? What BS is that? I'm sorry, but it's true. Also, if it's based on military, I'm sure there should be some military strategy - NOPE. practically nothing. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, all of this is not the fault of the animation team, they did the best with what they had to work with. They did a fantastic job with the animation. \\n\\n\r\nLast thing in the review I was attempting to keep short: FLASHBACKS!!! WHY. SO. MANY? - I remember watching an episode that was 3/4 flashbacks. Worst episode ever because there was 5mins of new content. \\n\\n\r\nMy summary of AOT: Crappy storyline and characters hidden behind massive flashy battle scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL RATING (for me) = 3/10\\n\r\n(based on all 5 sections) = 4.4/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I have a few people asking me about the sound rating I gave for this series. The subbed version wasn't all that good, and when I tried the dubbed I was laughing so hard at the voices that I couldn't focus on the series. The 5 is just my personal rating. I did not enjoy the opening song, however it did suit the series, so the sound probably deserves a 7 overall.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin's reviews are not at all consistent. Depending on who you ask they will either love the series or absolutely hate it, so if you're going to take anything from my review it's that you should try it for yourself. \r\nGetting to the actual review, now: I give the entire first season of this anime a 7 and honestly feel like a 7 is what it deserved.\r\nWhy?\r\nFirst off, the pacing. SNK is one of the slowest animes I have ever experienced. Its arcs span an unnecessarily long amount of episodes and barely get the story that far in the end. Its pacing wascompletely horrible considering it got 25 episodes. I'm guessing this is because the manga isn't finished which is completely understandable. However, by the end there were no plans to make a second season and the anime viewers were left incredibly confused and full of questions (then they turned to the manga where they were left were even more questions).\\n\\n\r\nSecond off, inaccuracy. One of the biggest issues manga readers had with this anime were the inaccuracies (mostly around the end of the anime) when it came to comparing the manga and anime. I know what you're thinking now, \"Animes can take different turns! Who cares!\" But, said inaccuracies even angered the original creator Hajime Isayama so you know that these will probably end up ruining major events or character development later on. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's get to the anime itself. The story? While interesting, like I said before, it has very slow pacing and will barely get watchers anywhere. Not at all a good standalone anime and it would probably be better as one of the bulky animes with 100+ episodes. It does a good job getting new readers for Isayama's manga though. I give it all a 7. \\n\\n\r\nArt? While it looks strange with its thick lines initially, the art style grows on you. The animation and art in general aren't disappointing in the least and it's almost surprising finding such a popular anime without girls with huge boobs and people with strange hair. I give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music and the voice acting (Japanese) were all great to me. I don't like the English dub (or what I heard of it) so much, but it's not exactly \"horrible\". The background music added perfectly to the feel of the rash and intense situations. I especially enjoyed the openings and the ending song gives it a strange, nostalgic, eerie feel that I also enjoy. I give sound a 9. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter. There are so many characters in SNK and character deaths come easily because of it. Eren Jaeger is as intense, angry, determined, and merciless as the series is and I think he makes a pretty decent main character. However, the girl who often follows beside him, Mikasa Ackerman, is barely given an explanation for why she is so attached to him and her background and Eren's background feel very unexplored in the anime and I hope they are explained more in the manga or the second season. Armin, who is the third main character, doesn't really make an interesting main character at all. In fact, I'm so unsure of why he's considered a main character at all (besides being Eren and Mikasa's friend) and understand why he's always switched out for Levi in promo art and merchandise. I can only hope that he does some major development later on because he seems like he could be very interesting. I give character a 7. \\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, did I enjoy SNK? It was long. It was long and I hated how long and slow it was (though I did expect them to take more time on an arc that luckily lasted only around 3 episodes or so) which really killed it for me and how it just ended. The ending was strange and unfulfilling because instead of solving a HUGE issue/mystery in the series it somewhat solved a new one they found in the last arc. However, I had people to talk to about the  anime while it was ongoing so that kept me entertained waiting for the new episode so I could say that I did enjoy it. Did I enjoy it enough to recommend it? Well, I'd only recommend this to someone who was new to anime. Mostly because of the mixed feelings that many people have with SNK and whether or not it is a quality anime, and also the fact that it's very popular and well known so anyone who is experienced with anime has probably heard of it and can make their own decision to take part in it. I don't believe everyone should experience this if they feel like they wouldn't enjoy it.",

Titans are humanoid type beings that eat people for fun just because they're bigger than them. And that's the idea of the anime. But the best part except from the amazing soundtrack, the beautiful art and the well-built (in my humble opinion) characters the best thing about this anime is the feelings it gives you. You start to wonder what whould you doin their place and how whould you react. Attack on titan is not based on super-humans that can kill titans without any problem, I think the fact that no one is safe there makes it special and you know that it's a life or death endless battle that even the best of bests can fall. \\n\\n\r\n(oh god I really love it, sorry) \\n\\n\r\nSo I'm gonna rate the anime now, but it's really hard to find any flaw. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 10 \\n\r\nI really love the concept and the story is just amazing. \\n\\n\r\nART: 10 \\n\r\nThe first thing that I loved about the design of the anime, except the colours, the titans and the sights was the eyes.

            "content": "WARNING: Due to the nature of this anime, Hinting a few things could not be helped while addressing some pros and cons during this review. With that said, I shall call out a minor SPOILER ALERT before I start this review. This review should be fine if you are at the halfway point or have already seen the entire thing.\r\nCritic\u2019s Log - Earthdate: October 31, 2014. Review #90: Attack on Titan\r\nThere is an anime convention that I attend on an annual basis known as Sakura-con. When I went there in 2013. Sword Art Online was heavily promoted and it was becoming popular at the time.I found it to be a complete clusterfuck. Earlier this year, This anime was also heavily promoted and is still is one of the most popular and one of the more talked about recent animes of this current decade. Do I really need to explain more? You know it, it\u2019s ATTACK ON TITAN!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSeveral hundred years ago, Humanity was on the brink of destruction because of giants. Giants are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by enclosing themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of giants. In present time,  the city has not seen a giant in over 100 years. That all soon changes when teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific\u2026 Okay, I will stop there just to be safe.\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, Attack on Titan (sometimes alternatively called \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d) is a Wit Studio production and this is actually their first production and this is an impressive looking series for starters. If you are familiar with the studio Production I.G. Wit Studio was founded by producers from that studio. Production I.G. has gotten quite a great reputation with production values, which is no surprise if you try out or seen Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. As for Attack on Titan, The animation is really good in this show. However, there are two little problems I had with the animation. Some of the CG in this show is kind of hit and miss but there are some areas where it is not an issue for me. The main issue I had in the animation leans more during the first half. The show had weird timing in pausing its animation. I did discover that there were changes made in the DVD/Blu-ray release to fix certain mistakes from the TV broadcast. but even with the changes made, there still was some moments where it pauses, even when there\u2019s dialogue going. It is a little odd to see things play out like that and this is a noticeable flaw in the animation. If you think that\u2019s bad, the Berserk TV Anime had the same problem years ago. For this being a start from Wit Studio, this was one hell of a start.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Hiroyuki Sawano is an interesting case. I have not seen other animes that he did the soundtrack to but for Attack on Titan. The soundtrack kicks ass. For a show dealing with Giants and humanity fighting for survival, the music does compliment the show. When it\u2019s thrilling, the soundtrack makes a nice bonus, when things get bad, a chorus might come in to make things sound pretty big. When it gets emotional...Damn, it can hit some people hard. The soundtrack to Attack on Titan is one of its strengths. Now here\u2019s where the real fun begins.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen voice acting is concerned, this is probably the one thing that has split opinions for most American anime fans. With the Subtitled Version. Yuki Kaji is probably ending up being well known for voicing Eren and it\u2019s not really a bad role. I haven\u2019t seen much animes that he plays a role in that much but with Eren\u2026 He does pull off the intense, angry moments pretty well\u2026 As for the entire performance. It\u2019s good to say the least but not phenomenal. As for Yui Ishikawa, she is a wonderful Mikasa and it is probably going to be her most memorable role for quite a while until something comes up I guess. Then there\u2019s Marina Inoue as Armin. The voice is good on its own nothing much to say there. There are any noteworthy seiyus outside the main cast. There\u2019s Hiroshi Kamiya as Levi\u2026The voice was pretty cool, if there is one seiyu that I did not like in this anime, it\u2019s Romi Park as Hange. The voice was a little deep for someone like her.. The Japanese cast is pretty average but has some well played performances from the main three leads. As for the Dubbed version, I can honestly say that Bryce Papenbrook is not a bad voice actor, but when I heard that he was picked to voice Eren. I was skeptical, I thought to myself \u201cHow is he gonna pull it off?\u201d... Well, as I watched the dub, his performance of Eren will take a little getting used to. As the show progresses, he actually proves his worth. As for Trina Nishimura, I thought this was an interesting choice since Mikasa was the one voice that I was actually a little worried about in regards to the dub. Well, I got to rest assured because Trina Nishimura actually plays Mikasa pretty well on her own without having to rely on a unique flair that Ishikawa-san gave on Mikasa. No objections here. Now I get to the point with Josh Grelle as Armin, out of all the main leads. Funimation really took the most liberty with Armin\u2019s voice. But in the long run, Josh Grelle was fantastic as Armin. Inoue-san was not a bad Armin at all, but I have to give some credit where it is due. Josh Grelle\u2019s take on Armin was the biggest surprise in the dub and his performance felt believable. Kudos to Mike McFarland for his ADR direction\u2026 It may not be a perfect dub persay, but it is nice to see a cast list that is mostly from Funimation but with a couple special additions outside their talent pool\u2026 One being Jessica Calvello who probably got the most fun part of the show with Hange Zoe. Another interesting choice was Matthew Mercer as Levi. Seeing as Levi was the most popular character in the show, I get the feeling Funimation knew they couldn\u2019t screw up the role, and the voice is also cool. Hiroshi Kamiya may sound a little badass with Levi, but Matthew Mercer sounds just as cool as well. You can\u2019t go wrong with either version on this one, and I also can say that Attack on Titan may be worth seeing Subtitled but if you give the dub a little getting used to. Chances are you might enjoy the dub too. I will say that it all depends on tolerance with certain voices. I\u2019ve already stated that I don\u2019t like Hange\u2019s Japanese voice but I love her English voice as well as that Bryce Papenbrook took me a while to get used to while Yuki Kaji was easy to adjust to. Both versions (in my opinion) are both listenable. This really boils down to preferences. The only issue with the dub is the adaptive script. It may have taken some liberties but it often had some moments that were not broken dialogue-wise and yet the adaptive script has some changes on some of those key moments\u2026 It is a minor nitpick overall but performance wise, it\u2019s still good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s see, what am I missing? I mentioned Animation, the soundtrack, the voice acting... Ah! Son of a bitch! I missed one part when I brought up the soundtrack! Well, I think now\u2019s the best time for me address it. What would that be? Oh, I don\u2019t know\u2026.But I sure as hell know for sure that once you hear \u201cSeid ihr das Essen? Nein, wir sind der J\u00e4ger!\u201d. You will not forget it. That first opening theme \u201cCrimson Bow and Arrow\u201d by Linked Horizon is so overloaded with awesome and it is one hell of an opening, it is rather depressing that after 13 episodes, it\u2026changes. And the second opening \u201cWings of Freedom\u201d also by Linked Horizon is... just as good\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs awesome as the first opening is, the second opening fits the tone considering what is to come. Even though the first opening is short-lived, the second opening does not disappoint. As for its closing themes, the first closing theme \"Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai\" by Yoko Hikasa is kind of a nice contrast with the first opening and it fits considering that Mikasa is heavily focused in that closing theme. Like the openings, there also is a second closing theme which is \u201cGreat Escape\u201d by cinema staff. The song is not a cup of tea I would finish but I don\u2019t think the song is bad, it\u2019s a little underwhelming out of all the themes in the show. The opening and closing themes really stick out in this show.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the things Attack on Titan, it does have one major weak spot. The characters. Now this is going to be a doozy. I will save the main three leads for last because I can\u2026 My major problem with Attack on Titan is how it utilizes its minor and supporting characters (save for a few that are connected with the main three) I will not go into much detail because it often leads into spoilers but I can say that the way the minor characters are treated wears out fast after a while. Sasha is funny at times and Levi is a badass for sure but if there\u2019s a character I did like that was not a main character, it would be Jean. He was not bad for a rival character (as stereotypical as it sounds). I grew to like the guy along the show\u2019s progression. With all that said, let the heated topic begin. Armin Artlet is a bit of a whiner which may irritate some viewers but I gave him the benefit of a doubt and I actually didn\u2019t mind much of his whininess as the story progressed. He may be the \u201cbrains\u201d of the main three but there is some ups and downs I have with Armin but I grew to like his character in the long run to an extent. Mikasa is actually a character I had mixed feelings about throughout the entire show.. She is cool for one thing but there\u2019s just one problem I had, She felt like a \u201cMary Sue\u201d to me. She was interesting when \u201cEpisode 6\u201d kicked in but as the show went on, well... try to figure out why I think Mikasa is kind of a Mary Sue in the show when you watch it. She is not a terrible character to say the least, it would be nice if some things could be written to make her less of a Mary Sue. Now I did save the main character for last for a specific reason and that is because when I was jumping into the show. I have heard people ranting and complaining about this show\u2019s main protagonist, Eren Yeager. It is obvious that I am going defensive over this, but I have my reasons. Eren often gets the bashing than other characters. In my opinions, the character interactions are pretty shoddy since most of the minor characters are there for a short time while the supporting characters do get some spotlight. As for the interactions with the supporting characters, some of them are done well and some of them should have been utilized more effectively instead of having a half-assed execution with its character writing. With Eren Yeager, he is often criticized for being too angry throughout the show\u2026 Allow me to ask this question,  Have you been paying any fucking attention while watching this show? I will admit that his impulse did get on my nerves, but that is besides the point. Eren does get angry in some moments, yes\u2026 But it actually has a purpose in the story. Now if I were in Eren\u2019s shoes and I saw my mother being eaten and killed by a Titan, I would be distraught and greatly upset. I can understand why Eren is feeling this way after his mother died. That and him swearing vengeance to kill every single Titan. I bring these two up for a very specific reason, This happened when HE WAS A CHILD. As expected, he goes through emotional trauma after what he saw which makes his desire to kill all Titans... plausible. There is another thing to address but I have to say this differently because it is quite considerably a heavy spoiler, but if you\u2019ve seen the show\u2026 You\u2019ll know what I mean. There is a little thing called \u201cPlot Armor\u201d, all I can say is that it has a benefit and detriment, and that is all I will say on that. Anyway, I actually do not hate Eren the way some people do, but I have to be honest here\u2026He has some flaws due to how he\u2019s written. I still find his impulsive moments a little jarring but overall, he still has his merits. But still after all that said and done, I still find the characters to be the weakest part of the show. It is obvious that Eren, Mikasa, and Armin get the most attention but it is hard for me to care for some of the characters who only have a short time. The supporting characters were fine but I noticed some of them got a good amount of screentime than others which is why I had a bit of a problem with the character interactions with the show. The characters are a mixed bag but I will give them the benefit of a doubt if a second season gets made\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis leads me to the story of Attack on TItan. The show starts out strong and does take a while to pick up\u2026 Along the way, it does slow down a.bit only to pick up the pace once again. However, there is one thing that does get on my nerves with this show and it is those fucking cliffhangers. Now to its credit, there are other animes that have done this as well and it did get me coming back for more, good or bad. Now I think it would be fair to say that Death Note had its fair share of cliffhangers as well\u2026 Which is interesting because Tetsuro Araki directed the Death Note anime as well as Attack on Titan. Like Death Note, his direction on Attack on Titan also was stylized in an epically over-the-top fashion while retaining substance. Highschool of the Dead on the other hand had little substance because that show focused heavily on the action and style as well as Guns, Zombies, and plenty of fanservice such as Pantyshots, Tatas, you name it....The overstylized moments are often saved for the action and the 3D gear movements which I found alright, moments where scenes look a bit shaky during dramatic moments are where I found them a bit overkill. It is a mild nitpick but overall. Now there is one thing that I will commend Tetsuro Araki for doing is taking liberties on the overall story of Attack on Titan with this adaptation. I will honestly say that I found the story decent, as for the overall execution, that\u2019s where the manga and anime differ. The anime adaptation is extremely faithful to its source material which is a nice thing. I say this because anime adaptations of ongoing manga tend to either make filler episodes or deviate from the original storyline and end it differently. Now the major difference between the anime and the manga is actually from the earlier episodes of the anime which is the reason why I threw in the little warning before I started the review. If the anime followed the manga from frame to frame throughout the 25 episode run\u2026 Episodes 3 and half of Episode 4 would have taken place in the middle of those 25 episodes. I found the manga quite jarring when Chapters 15 through 17 are concerned. I like how Tetsuro Araki took the liberty of placing it in its fitting placement in the overarching story. The anime\u2019s execution has its flaws but it is not as half-assed as the manga was. It is not Tetsuro Araki\u2019s fault at all, it\u2019s Hajime Isayama, the creator and writer of the manga. Seeing as how the anime is extremely faithful to the manga, Tetsuro Araki is excused in my eyes. If there is another thing I will also excuse is the pacing. The overall execution may be off in some areas but the middle portion is often noted for being slow. To be honest, I personally didn\u2019t have a problem with this. The only thing I could point out is that the pacing is unbalanced from time to time. That\u2019s my only nitpick about it. However, in spite of that, there actually is one major problem I had with Attack on Titan. It is most of the second half\u2019s execution. I did say that the anime has its flaws with this. Most of the second half is where I would label most of this at. I am afraid I can\u2019t go into much detail but it does rinse and repeat in a couple of areas, except with differences. That\u2019s all I could say really\u2026Now since the manga is still going and the anime ran for 25 episodes with no conclusion but a halt, it is no surprise that a Season 2 is demanded by viewers. George Wada, the president of Wit Studio did state that a second season is definitely happening. It has not been fully confirmed and I will not be surprised if it happens, but I do hope that it does get announced.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBefore I reach my verdict,  I would like to address some supplemental info regarding this anime and everything else connected to it.\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan is available by Funimation, it is also available by Manga Entertainment in the U.K. and Mademen Entertainment in Australia. The manga by Hajime Isayama is available by Kodansha Comics USA, a light novel \u201cBefore The Fall\u201d written by Ryo Suzukaze and illustrated by Thores Shibamoto is available by Vertical. Another manga which is outgoing at this time called \u201cAttack on Titan: Junior High\u201d by Saki Nakagawa is also available by Kodansha Comics USA as well as A manga adaptation of the \u201cBefore The Fall\u201d by the same writer of the light novel but illustrated by Satoshi Shiki. The manga \u201cNo Regrets\u201d written by Gun Snark and illustrated by Hikaru Suruga is also available by Kodansha Comics USA. The light novel \u201cHarsh Mistress of the City\u201d is available by Vertical. The manga spinoff \u201cTitan Short Skits\u201d (A.K.A. Sungeki no Kyojin) has not been released stateside for all I know but seeing as Kodansha is the publisher of everything Attack on Titan with Manga and light novels, I would not be surprised if it eventually comes into the U.S. If not, oh well... There is also a 2-part movie series of Attack on Titan which is not even fully released at the time I\u2019m reviewing Attack on Titan but it is going to retell the entire show in 2 parts and I don\u2019t see the point in this since the first 33 chapters of the manga were faithfully adapted in the show. There is also a live-action movie planned for Summer of 2015, and I don\u2019t have much to comment on this until it\u2019s released and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nWell... After much talk, it is time for my final verdict of this anime. It is without a doubt that Attack on Titan is a popular show and was a smash hit in 2013. It was hyped to colossal proportions and It has sold extremely well for both the manga and its anime adaptation, although the manga is making a shit-ton of money thanks to the anime which... did not disappoint me.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right, I was not disappointed with this anime. Attack on Titan was not perfect to begin with, the main characters were fine. Some of the supporting characters had decent screen time, some were just there. The story on the other hand I find kind of a mixed bag. It had some interesting ideas but it\u2019s execution is hit and miss. What really works in the show is its animation, and the soundtrack kicks ass. It is also exciting and intense, but I can really appreciate this anime for a few things, Being faithful to the manga without going into filler or deviating from it. Changing a little of the manga\u2019s narrative for the sake of chronology, and it also didn\u2019t have fanservice.  Whether you like it or not. Attack on Titan is not over and a second season would be ideal because we do not need another infamous ending like Berserk. For what it is, I liked it but not in the way the hype was building it up to be. It is still a smash hit and it doesn\u2019t have to be a Masterpiece for it to be awesome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith everything said and done, I give Attack on Titan a 7.6 out of 10, it is GOOD!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment, and if you want to salute Attack on Titan style\u2026Go ahead Soldier!",

I guess that's a good sign. \r\nI also like the intro. so sound is good (also when the titans snap the humanbones between their teeth it goes like crunch crunch :)\r\nCharacter: all characters are kinda dull. except for the 2 maincharacters because they seemto have killed a few robbers. and some personal stuff happened, but nothing big comapred to other animes.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment: like i said, i liked it a lot, but now I really start to get annoyed, havign the feeling they are wasting my time. I want to know how the story ends, but every ep i watch nothing happens for already 5 episodes, so guess what. I'll drop it (at episode 15).\\n\\n\r\noverall: if you want to see some cool action shots, a no brain story, and lots of boring moments watch this. But don't expect the same level of the first episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThis show started out awesome. I was really hooked, lots of action, tension etc. But then it starts to slow down. They start to reuse images from past episodes. Nothing wrong with that, but after seeing the same thing for 10 times it really gets boring. The intro also exist of 5 minutes of footage from the previous episode. They do a lot of flashbacks, or use old footage with a narrator saying some new text.",

            "content": "Attack on Titan focuses on the story of three young protagonists: Eren Yeager, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their mutual friend Armin Arlet.  In their world, humanity has been ravaged by otherworldly, humanoid beings known as Titans.  Titans look human, but make no mistake, they are anything but; they're giants that vary in height, they have -- in the words of one of the characters -- \"stupid expressions\" on their face, they're seemingly invincible, and they have no means of reproducing, yet continue to pop into existence.\r\n100 years prior to the story proper, the survivors of the initial Titan attacks created aseries of 50-meter high concentric walls to retreat into.  The outermost wall is known as \"Wall Maria,\" the middle wall is known as \"Wall Rose,\" and innermost wall is known as \"Wall Sina.\"  The walls were created to add a defense-in-depth protection from the Titans, who now inhabit what's referred to as the \"outside world.\"  Within the walls, humanity has built numerous towns and cities, but by being closed off to the outside world, resources are scarce, and a class system has somewhat developed.  The lower-class live in Wall Maria, and the upper-class live deep within Wall Sina, which keeps them safer and better off than most of the population.  However, they'll soon find out the peace they've grown accustomed to is short-lived when an aberrant, Colossal Titan beams down from the sky to breach the Wall Maria.\\n\\n\r\nThat's really all you need to know from a story standpoint, because to expand anymore would do more harm than good.  The strength of the show lies in its characterizations and plot development, so it's best going into it knowing as little as possible.  The pacing of the story starts off fast, and we see Eren, Mikasa, and Armin go from being powerless civilians to skilled soldiers in the span of a few episodes.  Then, from the moment they begin training, the scope widens and we're introduced to a variety of interesting characters.  Some characters only last a few episodes before either being killed off, or fading from the focus of the story.  But each character has a distinctive personality that separates them from your typical side characters.  The main trio is an affable bunch, and within a few episodes, you'll find yourself emotionally invested in their plight.  Eren, in particular, has such an intensity to him that it's hard not to get caught up in his emotional tirades.  On the other hand, Mikasa is the complete opposite, but her understated nature portrays a strong loyalty to those she cares about.  And while he\u2019s not a focal point as much as the other two, Armin has moments that allow him to prove his worth.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does not hold back on the violence neither, as Titans and characters alike are dispatched in some pretty gruesome ways.  That's not to say the violence is extreme; most of it is left to the imagination, but the impact a death leaves is somber and meaningful.  You'll find yourself lamenting the loss of minor characters because their death resonates throughout their friends and relatives.  Conversely, what's probably most surprising aspect about Attack on Titan is its ability to combine humor and drama in a way that neither undercut what the other is trying to achieve.  With most of the characters philosophizing about the limitations of humanity and their worthiness of survival, the appearance of characters like Dot Pixis, Hanji Zoe, and Sasha Blouse provide some much needed levity.  Without them and their character quirks, the story would probably be too bleak.  The series knew exactly when to ease up on the drama, and it was much appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the series wastes no time getting into the core of the story.  Then it slows down considerably, as episodes are crammed with indecisiveness, internal monologues, and a whole lot of flashbacks.  The material during those episodes is definitely fascinating, and allows for a good deal of character development (even from minor characters), but you can easily accuse the show of dragging its feet.  Attack on Titan does suffer from some pacing issues, but when it comes to postponing an inevitable conflict, Dragon Ball Z is the undisputed champ.  Interesting enough, the last few episodes of Attack on Titan are a perfect balance of exposition and action.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art style is fantastic and highly technical.  The medieval-like setting is brought to life by beautiful backgrounds, and the combination of hand-drawn and computer-generated imagery.  The characters are designed exceptionally well, and you really a sense of their emotional state of mind just by looking at the subtle changes in their faces.  The Titans are visually frightening -- their bodies have strange proportions that make them look even more bizarre when compared to their human counterparts.  Everything's pleasing to look at, but the battle scenes visually stand out as the most memorable.\\n\\n\r\nBattle scenes are smooth and easily to follow, and they're enhanced by the usage of the character's main mode of attack - the aerial 3D Maneuver Gear, which is a set of gas-powered grappling hooks attached to a person's hip.  This gear allows its wearers to fly through the air and battle the otherwise impervious Titans.  They're the primary mode of attack against the Titans, but are practically useless in an open setting.  But when used in closed quarters, with tall structures to latch on to, they make the fights between the humans and Titans exhilarating.  And despite humans having the 3D Maneuver Gear at their disposal, aberrant Titans make for unpredictable opponents.\\n\\n\r\nHaving never read the manga this is based on, I'm not sure how long the series can last.  Nevertheless, this is a must-watch for anyone who loves serious anime with a sense of humor.  It's far from perfect (despite perfect rating), but strong characters, crisp animation, and a very absorbing story ranks it amongst the best anime I've seen.",

            "content": "I have been a fan of Shingeki no Kyojin for almost two years now, and I can say for myself that this series is one of the most enjoyable I've ever watched, and I've named it my favorite anime out of all that I've currently watched. That being said, IT IS NOT PERFECT. At all.\r\nLet me explain by starting out with the story. There is a huge fucking plothole that never gets explained in the entire anime, and has yet to be explained in the 71 current chapters of the manga. This is something that a lot of critics point out and I would loveto go further into detail, but I cannot write spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nI find most of the characters rather lovable, even though some (a lot) only care about the main three; Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. Believe it or not, in a show all about killing gigantic humanoid creatures called \"titans\", the characters play such an important role in the series. As you watch, you can see the characters change according to their situations and then develop over the 25 episodes. A great example of this would be Armin; who goes from a self-pitying little kid, to one of the best strategists in the anime's military. (This goes further in depth in the manga, which gives a lot more to his character and honestly makes him one of my favorites.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd the fucking ANIMATION in this series is damn near perfect, if not, FLAWLESS. With fluid, 3D camera spins and rolls, it's impossible not to be on the edge of your seat whenever there's a fight scene with the 3DMG that the characters wear. it's some of the best animation I've ever seen, and I have yet to see anything better since it came out in 2013. It's unique, It's stylish, It's eye-catching, and really makes the series more gritty than it probably would've been with an artstyle any different. The same can most certainly my said for the absolutely amazing soundtrack; especially when there is a particularly epic or sad scene happening. The music can be a tear jerker on it's own.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there was character development in the anime, there definitely wasn't as much as I would've like there to be. I'm most definitely looking forward to the second season, where this little issue disappears forever. However, until then, the characters can only be explained as above average.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a well made, well produced, and well directed anime that will definitely be remembered for years down the line in the anime community. With likable characters and a gripping story, you'll be binge-watching it after the first episode alone. 8.5/10.",

            "content": "You know a franchise is successful when you can find pictures of Mikasa floating around on food packagings. Yes, as if chips need her protection from getting eaten by a titan. ha ha ha. Sorry that was a terrible joke. \r\nContains Spoilers, minor. \r\nAnyways let's talk about Attack on Titans. This show becomes so popular in the west that makes people forget One Piece and Naruto have ever existed. Popular things tend to not be the \"best\" things, but it is undebatable they always have aspects that are truly good and worth praising. That said, these good features tend to overshadow the flaws and problemsthat would otherwise be extremely obvious if we put them in a mediocre show. \\n\\n\r\nAll constructive criticisms are welcomed and great appreciated via comment or PM. This is a rather critical review so my personal enjoyment is... not taken into account, for the most part. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (Concept 2/2, Execution 4/8) \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of AoT is perhaps the major reason that led it to be a successful series. The universe uses a direct, simple yet effective theme: Humans are going extinct, the the cause is humans themselves. This idea is expressed in a very unique/generic (yes I know it's a contradiction) way by integrating a superb cliche idea of \"monsters kill humans\" with another superb cliche idea of \"humans kill humans\". When you put these two ideas together, it becomes unique and refreshing to look at. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the execution has failed to explore this wonderful world. Within the walls, we are shown to many things including but not limited to kidnapping, corruption, abuse of power, racial inequality and many other things that are supposed to be impressive and amusing to know. The problem is none, none of these interesting factors have a real purpose other than making the audience feel amused. SHOCK FACTORS. I personally do not dislike shock factors, but at least there should be a purpose on the factor instead of just pouring in the factors for the pure sake of amusement. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not finished, and I haven't read the manga yet. So far, the general trend is very straightforward. The first arc Crimson Bow, which talks about how the humanity defend a titan invasion and the second arc, Wings of Freedom, which tells a story of a group of people trying to \"find out\" the \"origin of titans\" are both reasonable, yet rather predictable arcs that successfully deliver the storylines to the audience without too much confusions. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, some parts of the show are very terribly paced and absolutely unnecessary. Events occur just to flesh out some character background. In the first arc the pacing is horribly fast. It took Eren only 2 episodes to get to the cadet training camp and only 1 episodes before he first fights titans. Things are escalated so quickly. That may not be a bad thing, since many other shows such as Code Geass and Gurren Lagann all have super fast paced plot and they keep us excited. The problem with titan however, is that in the second half of the show, everything goes dangerously slow to a point of kind of boring. It took the show full 3 episodes to run to the forest and actually begins the quest. We've been seeing many character falling off the horse and half of the time is pretty lame and contribute little to the story. \\n\\n\r\nThere were many unreasonable events that tells little about the story, at the same times waste solid, whole episodes screening time. In the cadet training camp for example, the potato girl's little interaction with the officer is... not funny, and that scene lasts for one and half mins. Yes, I agree that this scene kind of becomes titan's trademark, but still purposeless. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and can someone tell me why there was a hand-to-hand combat training in the titan-killing-skill training camp? \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the story is slightly above average. It does tell a good story without making it boring, with the use of shock factors and filler scenes, it has a little bit of flavor to spice it up. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (Design 1/2, Development 2/8) \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is extremely generic. Which is fine since generic, unextreme characters tend to be the ones that appeal to the general public. The downside to that is they are forgettable. Very forgettable. They don't have any symbolic value like Edward in FMA or Spike in Bebop, they don't have anything other than their unique hair colors and given character treats. (yay pokemon!) \\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the deaths that AoT is known for. From Eren's mom to the \"Elite Four\" serving Captain fangirl, although some do have symbolic meanings, most of them are just there purely for the shock factors. The death of Elite Four was mostly a shock factors because it contradict the popular belief of \"friendships and bounds creates victories\". Of course we can see it as \"resembling to the reality\", but it is inconsistent because the show itself is not a resemblance to the reality thus such thing should not be considered. It is just a shock factor.\\n\\n\r\nNow we can talk about the development of complex pokemons. Eren, we knows nothing about him other than he is angry. Sure at the end of the show he becomes more understanding and changes his belief, but he is still the same person as before. He did not develop to a more mature character or anything like that, he merely received some amount of flashbacks and does some 2Dimensional character flip flops. \\n\\n\r\nMikasa. Why would you like her? She barely has any characteristic that makes her a legit person, she stays with her ideologies from beginning to the end. She has special episodes to describe her encounter with Eren and that's all it is. She is NOT a goddess of victory as she plays no part during any important events where Eren is in danger. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the casts are all plot devices. They are there because the plot needs them to be there. They feel inhuman, they don't have any real development and they are seriously sometimes only 2D or even 1D characters. Really nothing to say much about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of the characters is that, all of them feel like half-assed shounen characters that try to be something serious. They are essentially \"mature\" pokemons that have dark sides and actual brains. \\n\\n\r\nBut afterall, some of the character treats are likable. It's rare to see a relatively independent female character like Mikasa, tho somehow she is overly attached to Eren so the fanboys can imagine... Yea I get it. But that doesn't make her a good character. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGraphic (Art 5/5, Animation 5/5)\\n\\n\r\nIf you are still with me by this point, I thank you to the sincerest. \\n\\n\r\nArt is great. The art style is very unique. Things such as the weirdly but appealing looking thickened character outlines that defies the current trend of \"everything in 3D\". 2D animation can also be just as beautiful. The extremely amazingly looking titans just grabs my eye like a magnet. At first I felt a little bit of absurd how all of them are naked, but eventually as I get used to them, I realized how most of them resembles typical mid-age male body shapes and how powerful they look. The art is also very consistent. There isn't any significant difference between the \"action scenes\" and the \"talking scenes\" in terms of art style and quality, unlike shows such as SAO, where the action scenes are refined but the regular talking scenes are stale and boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation... gosh they are just good. Brought to you by the animation director Death Note, Guilty Crown and... high school of the dead *cough cough*, Tetsuro Araki, you will experience possibly one of the top 5 animation in anime existence. Aside from amazingly detailed action scenes during titan fighting, the use of different camera angle during the ordinary conversational scenes maintain the exciting atmosphere of the show's overall feeling. \\n\\n\r\nThis is good. And good things need to be experienced. So I wouldn't talk much more, enjoy it yourself. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (OP/ED 2/2, OST 4/4, Dub 1/4, Sub 4/4)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is one of the most engaging song I've heard for the longest time. It just fits the show so perfectly, and the complex but straightforward metal/vocal/orchestra mix creates really nice, glorious, solid soundtrack. It is worth mentioning that the rest of the song (the original, not just the 1:30) version is not nearly as good since it basically just repeats itself over and over to a point of dreadfulness. I've been listening to this song for months now and it is a bit irritating. The second OP is, in my opinion, just as good, or even better. The climax of the second some is a really nice melody that the first one does not have.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the ED... um... I never really listened to them all the much but they are also wonderful songs. (sorry about that :P) \\n\\n\r\nOST feels like those songs you often hear from historical films where people fight gloriously on the battlefield, that's exactly how it feels. When the plot is going under a darker and depressed mode, the song is calm, but without losing the excitement. They reminds me pacific rim's soundtrack which I love (it was the only good part of that movie). Notable tracks including but not limited to Vogel im Kafig, Doa, and The Reluctant Heroes are very well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub. Funimation you lazy bastard is the only thing I have to say. They used the most overpraised voice actors who are clearly 50 years old to try speak in 16 year old tones. Come on, can't you at least do something like an real audition so the talented people actually get a chance to contribute their talent to the community? Why can't you learn from Japan and do the shit right? Watch sub if you don't mind reading, the dub can only be classified as \"understandable\". \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAoT is my all time favorite action show. I completely enjoyed it, since the actions are truly amazing and not stupid. I was kind of disappointed about the character, but they aren't the focus so... Yea I'll let it slide. The story is fine, it does its job to carry the action. Very enjoyable series and easily recommendable to literally anyone. This is a really fun show to watch. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (8/10) \\n\\n\r\nDespite the lack of character development, this show does perfectly on what it tries to do. Since no one focus on the characters all that much, the action and music shine brightly. A solid 8 for what it has accomplished and the good features it has. This is one of the show that requires you to not overthink (like I did) and it certainly is a respectable piece of entertainment.",

            "content": "I have to admit. This is one of the few animes that I thought were going to be underwhelming. Boy was I wrong!\r\nPLOT/STORY\r\nThe story is somewhat familiar, what with mankind being under attack and driven to some point of extinction by some overwhelming force of power, it did feel familiar, but it was delivered in such a way that kept you watching despite the similar plot device to other animes out there. The story did deliver in a span of 25 episodes and did not leave anything unanswered (for the most part). It was a fast paced, intense series of episodes which never failed todeliver on action or drama. This is really a good anime to start with, for those looking with a starting point. Yes the anime is dark, and it is bloody in some scenes, but it was done in a necessary way that conveyed the high stakes of the situation. \\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nSay what you will about the story (If you didn't like the story, but why wouldn't you?) the art style of the series is very attractive and eye catching. The thick bold outline of each character really made them pop out and be distinguishable from the rest of the cast. It was really well done. The backgrounds were never....how would you say this...hmm...dull. Have you ever watched an anime and felt that the background was very underwhelming and looked like it took no effort due to the lack of dynamics and movement? well you well never get that disappointment here. Whether it is Eren and Mikasa using their omni gear from place to place in the towns or forest, the backgrounds felt very much alive. Again, it is very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nIn one word: Intense. Yes it is very intense. I watched both sub and dub and both VA's were able to deliver the characters feelings and emotions well enough that you could feel it yourself. The way Eren screams out when titans attack makes you feel his rage. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nWhether it was our group of protagonists against a titan, using their omni gear from place to place, every episode was exciting and intense to watch. Never a dull moment, as I say. The constant battle between titans and man was truly not disappointing to watch as much as how realistic it would be if titans did attack. The group had its struggles to overcome but thats what made it so exciting and worthwhile to watch. Whether it was a moral problem or a physical problem, it was done in such a way, that you could feel what their up against.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nI was truly immersed in this anime and it shouldn't be something to be looked over. People have said it is overrated, and yes, in some aspects it may be, but come to this anime with a clear mind from recent criticisms, and you will in no doubt enjoy this as much as I did.",

            "content": "This anime is popular for a reason, its flashy, the animation and music are great, the fight scenes are stylish and on the surface level it seems really cool. With that out of the way, I HATE this anime, when I was watching it I literally wanted to punch my screen. The First thing that pissed me of were some of the characters, most of them are mediocre to slightly interesting, but some are awful. The main character is alright, but Mikasa is a cold soulless husk created so that the writers could have someone to kill a titan if they need it. Armin isAWFUL, anytime anything gets even a little bit tough he literally falls on the ground and starts screaming about how he \"can't do it\", and ends up getting like 3 people killed in the process. This might be ok and completely believable if he did this a couple of times, but he spends the whole show doing it. I've never hated a character more. The rest of them are pretty generic tropes like most anime, but some have a couple interesting things about them. The dialogue is a joke a lot of them time, I understand that these people have seen some shit and are facing death, but COME ON. Most of it is people standing around, complaining, yelling, arguing, and accusing each other of stuff. Meanwhile, everyone around them is dying and they just start arguing about nothing. Not to mention the insane freak out moments where they streak the animation and shake the screen around. It was INFURIATING. But that's not all, next we have the story. I admit that the original premise is interesting, but they spend little time on it. Most of the story is about humans attempting to do something and then failing horribly. You know how in comics and stuff the good guy always wins, and so you never actually feel tension for the situation? This show is the exact opposite, the good guy always loses, they literally can't do anything right. If somebody gets in a bad situation then you know they are dead. Even worse, the writers pull like anti-deus ex machina stuff out of nowhere just so that the humans will lose. So even if things seem alright, nope, somebodies probably going to die. The soldiers are completely useless and die all the time, except for a few badass type characters who fly through titans like nothing. The pacing is terrible, with the first few episodes flying by and being really interesting and then nothing happens for like 7 episodes. By the end of the anime you have learned NOTHING about ANYTHING interesting in the story. They present to you a couple of mysteries in the show that you think will be interesting when they get to them, but they don't even try to progress to some and the writers come up with a way to crush any efforts to get to others. The only reason this show gets a 4 is because the production was very good, but damn this show did nothing but make me angry after the first few episodes. Proceed with caution.\\n",

            "content": "Dear lord I finished this quickly.  Only feels like yesterday I did my SYD review... 25 episodes in 2 days isn't too bad for a college student with finals coming up.\r\nSpoiler alerts?\r\nStory: 9 \r\nThe story of humanity against a threat that can possibly lead to the extinction of humans.  The story follows Eren Jager and a bunch of other people as they experience battles with the Titans, monsters who have it out for humans.  Through these battles, we see the death of many soldiers, the psychological effects of a war when tides are against them or when the plan fails, and massivecharacter development.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story was paced so well, nothing was rushed, and as with an action anime, it wasn't slow either.  So no complaints on pacing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nQuite a let-down for me, since everyone hyped the art to be amazing.  ONLY 1 SCREENSHOT FOR MY COMPUTER BACKGROUND... Maybe I wasn't paying attention to scenery enough like I do with other animes... but the scenery art wasn't out of this world, good, just not outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest reason I don't watch action animes, is that when action scenes happen, the art style suffers or the animation is subpar.  SnK did an amazing job with their action scenes, as we were able to tell what was exactly happening with the characters involved and I saw to decrease in art.  The \"Three Dimensional Movement\" looked really well animated, I was quite surprised at how great it looked after seeing decent scenery art.\\n\\n\r\nGore.  Wasn't really expecting this much gore.  I know this anime was going to be violent, but I thought it would be violent in a non-gorey way (That makes sense to me).  A lot of the times, I feel like a Titan should have caused certain bodies (Mainly Petra's) to disappear based off the Titan trying to crush the soldier.  Just a thing I wanted to bring up...  Not really related to my review though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nBefore I watched this, I have heard the first OP everywhere.  It is quite catchy, although I would have gone with a different direction art-wise with the OP.  The second OP wasn't as good, but still a nice addition to my iTunes, with a great art-style for it.  \\n\\n\r\nBoth EDs were amazing, the first being a great piano song, the second being a great rock tune.  No complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nBackground music didn't really stick to me, felt very normal to the scene, and something I will not be going out of my way to look up to relisten to.\\n\\n\r\nInsert Songs were amazing, great choice of music for the select few songs that got in.  These I will be looking up in the near future to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nAt first, I hated all the male characters.  HATED THEM.  Jean wasn't the nicest, Armin was a baby, Connie was sorta just there, and I felt that Eren was a bit annoying (Yes, I understand you want to exterminate them all... calm down a bit)  I typically don't like male characters anyways, since the animes I watch are focused on females.  The thing that was great was: the introduction of Pixis, Levi and Erwin, characters with great intelligence when it comes to war, and the development of the characters I mentioned earlier.  Rather not go into detail, as I am trying to keep this a spoiler free as possible.\\n\\n\r\nFemale characters are the bomb.  Sasha is handsdown my favorite character of this series, as she was a great comic relief character.  Something I never expected from this anime was the humor she brought.  Annie being one of the most interesting characters in this anime, and Krista being the most cute character in this anime.  \\n\r\nMikasa... Sometimes I want to say her character developed, but other times, she is still trying to do what she did from the very beginning, protecting Eren.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\r\nVery enjoyable, the hype did not lie about this anime.  I was under the hipster impression that this anime was mainstream and gonna suck... but I still wanted to give it a chance and I am glad I did.  I don't enjoy action animes, especially ones with a lack of romance, but this anime did a great job showing me that I can enjoy it.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis made me push aside all my studying for my finals to watch this series, but I am so glad that I did.  \\n",

The story takes unprecedented turns and doesn't fail to surprise the viewer. Also the writer mercilessly kills off important characters.\nThe art is the best I've seen in any anime so far. A plain 10. I would give it a 11 if it was possible. The animators have succeeded in masterfully merging 2D and 3D animation without messing it up. Also everything about the art is fantastic and that said, I need to mention the amazing Openingand Ending that each episode has.\\n\\n\nThe character development gets a 10 straight. The writer achieved the same level of character development in 7 episodes that Masashi Kishimoto achieved in over 500 episodes of the Naruto series.\\n\\n\nVoice and sound are also the best present. The OST s really lighten up the mood and help build up the tension. I am eagerly waiting for an official release of the soundtracks. 10 again.\\n\\n\nAttack on titan leaves you begging for the next episode each week and each episode ends at the precise moment to achieve this goal. The fighting scenes are well worked and make you have an adrenaline rush.\\n\\n\nOverall, we are facing one of the best things that has happened in the anime industry in years. Not really surprising when the brilliant director of Death Note has taken the director seat for this anime.",

            "content": "The work the animation team did is rather outstanding here, the animation and music is superb and the whole thing is relatively well directed. But, and it's a big but, like \"damn, Becky, look at that but\", the source material has several glaring issues that prevent the anime from truly earning its gargantuan hype. Most of these stem from the fact that nothing really significant seems to happen in terms of progression, for both the plot and the characters. Note that I am taking the manga chapters I read into consideration here too, which was up to about 50. Each arc suffers from one oftwo major problems, they either aren't properly wrapped up or they are just plain boring. The first arc is part of the latter, it just wasn't satisfying to see all the training from past episodes barely even get put to use. Most of the other arcs suffer from the other problem though, they each seem to bring up some kind of head scratching question, these questions are some of the best things in the manga/anime, but the problem is that the anime ends before any get answered. Normally this would be okay because you can just move on to the manga, which most people do, but here that doesn't work because 28 rather large chapters later I still haven't found any complete answers to these questions. This is not because despite large investigation on the characters' behalf the questions are too hard to answer. This is because the characters all seem to either forget or give up on these questions completely. However, I can never tell which reason it is because the characters are so underdeveloped. Attack on Titan has quite a few characters, and since they are all too busy running around in circles trying to figure something out or solve some kind of problem only to inevitably fail they get little time for growth. And despite its reputation Attack on Titan doesn't actually kill off its characters any more than any other anime, a few of the many side characters die occasionally but since none of them get enough screen time it really doesn't matter much. There are a few characters that seem interesting and do see some development, but none of these ones get killed and I doubt they will for a long time if ever. Namely are Jean, Armin, Christa, Ymir and maybe Levi and Hanji, but with the exception of Armin these are all side characters whose screen time is eaten up by the male stand-in Eren and his all-too-familiar yandere sister that conveniently isn't actually his sister. This leads me to one of my smaller problems but its worth mentioning because it may become significant. People want Eren and Mikasa together. This is bad because it could ruin Mikasa as a character. If given a good enough justification for her obsession with protecting Eren, like not wanting to lose the last of her family she has potential to be a unique character, but if they get together that gets flushed down the toilet because it just turns her into an overly attached girlfriend and makes her obsession too clich\u00e9. Add on to this the fact that their relationship right that now is more like that of a mother and son, because she has been taking care of him since they were kids and he wants to take care of himself and be independent because he is a super typical 15 year old boy. Another problem I have there is that Eren actually can't take care of himself. Without the convenient boon of his thing that I won't spoil he would totally suck ass and get eaten. This takes me to my final issue: there is an enormous power gap between Levi, Mikasa, maybe Hanji and literally every other person in the whole show. The fact that Levi and Mikasa cut through hordes of Titans like swiss cheese makes it hard to believe and sympathize with everyone who gets eaten or \"has\" to retreat, especially when Mikasa is so strong for pretty much no reason at all. So yeah I may have bashed this a lot but it is because I got so into the show in the first place that I feel so strongly so I have hope that Isayama might actually start tying stuff together and if he does he'll have fixed the largest of the issues, so while AoT is not nearly as good as its made out to be now it may get closer soon, so it might be worth getting into if you think you can wait for that.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin (SNK) is by far the only anime that has ever satisfied me thoroughly. Though the story itself is unoriginal (apocalypse theme with humanity on the losing side), I praise the author for his obvious devotion in this. It's evident that a great deal of research was done to come up with this epic tale that so far is free from any plot holes. How he skillfully manage each of the events and the characters involve so as to diverse it from the stereotypes and the current trend in anime is just- wow.\r\nThe art is what literally brought me to the animated series.I knew of SNK before it was adapted. Me reading it was more or less prompted by the lack of activities back then but not once have I regretted anything since I clicked it. Anyway the visuals are very pleasing to the eyes, and the fact that the animators paid attention to every possible detail is what made everything suitable for the kind of genre SNK has and commendable enough to leave one's mouth hanging open (tested and proven). From the historical setting to the action scenes, everything is well accounted for. Contradictory to how meticulous the environment is portrayed, the less-complex looking characters look at home probably because of their dark borders and how color coordinated they are with their surroundings (thank god I haven't seen any of the pink or green hair common in anime). I have my hat's down for the artists and animators.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are nicely done. The opening songs are really attention grabbers, with all those operatic voice(s) at the start and the indescribable instruments that worked remarkably well together. The rest of the instrumentals you can hear throughout the series (usually backing up intense, rise of action moments and such) also did great in strongly depicting the emotions  and in not competing with the characters' dialogue. I can't say I'm a good judge of music, but it's not everyday that I immediately like them in one sitting seeing as I'm very picky when it comes to them (which is what happened in this case haha).\\n\\n\r\nI must say, the characters are what really surprised me. They have all the elements of the common characters found in other animes (I had to compare), but how these accustomed personalities are twisted to match the ever dreary atmosphere of the story was stupefying. My speculations regarding their attitudes and how they work with it are always thrown off the cliff. Though I did get some right, it is a new experience for me not being able to prognosticate their intentions. Their unpredictability is what got me glued to the monitor and what kept me clicking on the next episodes.\\n\\n\r\nErwin never ceases to amaze me with his intellect that seem to get sharper and wider as the story goes on. His growing experience in the field is obviously the reason why he's often a few steps ahead Armin's smart analyzations and I'm sure the latter will become like him in due time.\\n\\n\r\nArmin's tenacity is one of the things I'm looking over because by now I've deduced that fools like him are the ones who are capable to continuously adapt themselves in a frightening pace (he'll soon become someone mentally and physically stronger than the Armin we know of). Eren as well, since I never thought that a blood-lusting young man who's only filled with revenge and dangerous desires be made into the hero of mankind. But that's a good thing though, because he seemed like the personification of the fearful and weak mass of people; full of flaws and near impossible ideals. Because Eren's character is not overly done and nowhere near close to perfection, I love and hate him at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nConni also caught my attention,  particularly because of how forced his passive attitude is. His drastic resignation to being a person who's caught in the flow caused by abandonment of his previous headstrong attitude was sadly obscured by the strong presence of the trio, but that didn't stopped me from noticing him (okay, I paid attention to him first because he's bald). He's a great guy and someone you can count on, although a bit cowardly and small in size.\\n\\n\r\nThe other surrounding characters also have their own eccentricities and dark sides. It seems that their inner demons are slowly gaining the spotlight because of how desperate the situation is becoming. Again, another good thing because it shows how disgusting, at the same time praise worthy, a person's real intentions are. SNK's creator really made a great clash with fantasy and reality.\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this series, because \"enjoy\" is a happy emotion stimulated by happy moments. SNK has none of that. Fear, distress, tense, anxiety, sadness, gloom, thrill, mental breakdown, and overwhelming horror/terror is what I felt while watching/reading this story. Add those with the blood and gore shown throughout the whole series, it's spectacularly hair-raising. I have no regrets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall is a perfect score of ten. Bias or not, you can't deny the fact that it's EPIC AND FILLED WITH AWESOMENESS.\\n",

            "content": "I'll jump straight to the point: it gets better every episode.\r\nI didn't see why SnK was so mainstream popular, but once I managed to get past the first terrible, terrible episode (if you liked the first episode, you are a monster.), I saw the light. The brilliance is in how impossible it is to tell what is coming next. The storyline is filled with the horrifying side to human nature, and it isn't a utopia, guys, there is going to be blood, gore and terrified humans. I like how everything is about survival, and making sure they live another day. Storyline 10/10\r\nArt: AMAZING. Go watchthe opening songs and you will get a feel of how amazing the art is. Everything is given life and a story in each frame, and every movement has a meaning. 10/10 definitely.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I like the 1st OP, but damn, the 2nd one is just the best. #LeviHeichouFTW In any case, the sound effects make the show suspensive as hell. The entire soundtrack is just epicness that cannot be described with words. \"Music says the words we don't\" 10/10 for me\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: HEICHOU",

            "content": "\"If you win, you live. If you lose, you die. If you don't fight, you can't win!\" - Eren Jaeger \r\nAttack on Titan is my all-time favorite anime. It is pretty gory, and a ton of bloodshed. Obviously. If you were \"caged in like livestocks\", would you be like Eren, who wants to see the outside world? \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI'm going to assume you all know what this story is about, just because this anime is so popular. The story is outstanding. What would happen to our world if one day human-like giants came and smashed our very home with our own eyes? Or our familygetting eaten as well? The story is extremely creative. What if Attack on Titan becomes true one day, what would become of mankind? Would it be extinct? And would Titans rule the world? \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe blood is very real. The titans are nicely drawn as well, and the scary ones really do look scary. The titans are uniquely drawn, and you can see the bones of the Colossal Titan. I can see how people can see this anime as horror, though it really isn't that scary, and I like the way they drew the fights between Titan and Titan, when they're smashing each other apart.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe two openings are amazing, and the epic battle music fits in with the epic mood of the fight scenes, it is terrific, it makes you get all hyped for the next fight. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nMy favorite character in Attack on Titan is Eren, because he is that suicidal bastard who cares nothing about himself, and is not even afraid of titans anymore, he just wants to exterminate all the titans and wipe them from the face of the world. I like how he's very determined, even a lecture from his mother won't do, and even going against her wishes. Mikasa is cool, and she is a great fighter, ex. Mikasa vs Annie. Mikasa can even throw Eren to the ground with one hand, it shows how strong she is, and she supports her two friends, following them wherever they go, because she doesn't want to lose her family again. Armin is a chill tactician, even though he is physically weak, his strategic minds are necessary during fights, and both Eren and Mikasa trusts him when they're in a dangerous situation, such as letting him make the speech about how Eren is a human and whatnot. Levi is a coolheaded leader, and a clean freak XD\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed Attack on Titan a lot and I am glad that I gave it a try, and I am eagerly waiting for the second season to come out. Though if you don't like too much gore, then don't watch it.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Kyojin has been a hugely popular series since its inception as an animated series. Mankind is under attack from the mysterious and equally terrorizing force known as titans. After a spell of peace, the quiet threat has emerged as even more devastating to humanity. The show follows Eren, Mikasa and others as they are set to face the titans head-on. \r\nThe story behind Shingeki no Kyojin is both gripping and engaging. The show suddenly throws the viewer into a world with many unanswered questions. What are titans? How can they be defeated and if so, can they ever be defeated entirely? As theplot progresses, the cast slowly uncovers hints behind the origins of titans and leaves the viewer desiring more. Both the art and soundtrack of Shingeki no Kyojin are exceptional. As an example, the first opening, \"Guren no Yumiya,\" left a large impression on those in the anime community. The quality of the animation in the series is surprisingly much higher than that of the original work. Significant amounts of details are added to even townspeople and backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThis being said, Shingeki no Kyojin appears to be a tremendously entertaining title. However, it is not without its own flaws. The main issue is the pacing. The pacing can be slow, excruciating slow, at times. While this can add to tension, it is taken to the extreme. The show includes a 6-episode arc, in a 25-episode series, which does little to push forward the plot. Due to this overall inefficient use of time, character development is almost halted and conflicts between the ranks and government are not fleshed out in a meaningful fashion. From this one deficiency, the quality of the show decreases dramatically and the viewer is left largely disappointed. Ultimately, it feels as if though all of the unanswered questions posed by the show are simply that, unanswered questions. \\n\\n\r\nFor those interested in picking up the show, I would highly recommend reading the manga at the same time for more closure.",
