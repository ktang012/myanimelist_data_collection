            "content": "The isekai genre is really becoming a hot new trend of recent years. From RPG game settings to being reborn into a fantasy world, it\u2019s a genre that has attracted a lot of attention. One of the biggest shows from last year, Re:Zero really took that to a darker side. It seems these days, isekai focuses too much on fantasy adventures \u2013 the typical story involving survival, battling monsters, or forming guilds. Any fan of open world and MMORPG games knows these formulas as they make up a good deal of the gaming market as well. Then, there\u2019s Isekai Shokudou, a show that takes onthe isekai genre but formulates it into something much more different.\\n\\n\r\nAlso known as \u2018Restaurant to Another World\u2019, the series combines elements of fantasy, slice of life, and cooking. Coming into this show, I didn\u2019t originally have high expectations. I would ask myself, \u201cwhat\u2019s so special about a show with cooking?\u201d That was originally my first impression anyway as the first few episodes introduces the setting and characters. Make no mistake, the series\u2019 title is what it is. The main setting takes place at a restaurant known as the \u201cYoshoku no Nekoya\u201d (Western Cuisine Cat Restaurant). From the outside, it looks rather unremarkable. Still, it\u2019s the inside that may surprise you especially with the delicious dishes it serves. More importantly are the characters that visits and work there.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime consists of a very small cast of main characters. It all begins when the owner of the shop discovers Aletta, a demon girl eating discreetly at his restaurant. Having being rejected by the human world, she finds work at Nekoya and serves as a valuable asset. Joining them is Kuro, a strange black-horned elf girl who serves as a waitress to pay off her bills. Although the show consists of a small character cast, the Red Queen is one other distinguishing character to take notice as she has her own personal reasons to visit Nekoya. With a cast this small, it feels like the show is taking a daring risk to craft any story. To be honest, this show doesn\u2019t have much of a plot as each episode is like a story of its own. The main premise is how this special restaurant brings otherworldly customers on Saturdays each week. These characters ranges from elves, fairies, animal men, and even dragons. From my perspective, the show doesn\u2019t really need to rely on a concrete plot as it demonstrates the ability to entertain with its slice of life content. It achieves this with character interactions between the staff and patrons. While these patrons usually possesses otherworldly features, they behave just like normal human beings. It also helps that the show takes time to get us to know these characters. Some episodes gives us insight about their background stories, the world they came from, and even their origins. As a show that relies much more on its characters than story, it gives more reasons for the audience to care about them. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the show being very lighthearted, it still has some light drama such as fantasy discrimination. It\u2019s why Aletta is ostracized from the human world in the first place. In addition, noble characters such as the half-elf Victoria forbids themselves to marry. On the other hand, dragons are (particularly the elder ones) are worshipped like Gods. To say the least, the cultural drama of the show is just enough to make it watchable but not enough to brew up a story.\\n\\n\r\nNow, how can we forget about the food? After all, it\u2019s what the patrons are there for in the first place. Believe me, this series really knows how to craft its dishes. There\u2019s all sorts of food introduced ranging from meat cutlets, fried shrimp, spaghetti, tofu steak, sandwiches, curry, buns, etc. As you can see, the cuisine is diverse and often adapts with each episode\u2019s style. Each episode has new types of characters coming so each it introduces new food on the menu. I\u2019m also surprised by the realistic details of the food as it looks very credible. The coloring, texture, and context overall make the food very convincing. Add the patrons\u2019 reactions and you\u2019ll quickly understand why.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Silver Link, the anime has a colorful vibe and solid visual quality with its character designs. The fantasy elements is very evident with the otherworldly characters and their different worlds. By character designs, they reflect on high fantasy traits such as with elf\u2019s ears, demon\u2019s horns, animalistic features of the animal men, etc. It\u2019s very stylistic as the show makes them look convincingly as possible. The restaurant itself doesn\u2019t look very remarkable as it has a very simple design, both inside and outside. There\u2019s minimal fan service in this show as it really relies much more on the food to catch a viewer\u2019s attention. Overall though, I think Silver Link got their point across when decorating the colorful style of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say for a fact that the soundtrack of the show will be memorable. It\u2019s mostly lighthearted and hardly noticeable most of the time. What did take my notice is the voice acting especially with Kuro. She\u2019s perhaps the most unique character in the show as she communicates telepathically with others. She also has a stoic personality so stepping into the shoes of such a character is never easy. Thankfully, her role in the show is memorable for those traits thanks to the modern talents of Saori Oonishi. \\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Isekai Shokudou really lacks in storytelling and if you\u2019re seeking a colorful plot, then look elsewhere. Almost every episode feels the same and doesn\u2019t make much attempt to change despite different characters being featured. It\u2019s also a show that can hardly make anyone laugh as its comedy side feels stale. However, I would say this show is recommendable especially if you\u2019re more interested in a slice of life-fantasy anime. Every episode itself has a story and brings together characters to create something worth to talk about. The cooking elements is well-detailed and really offer an interesting side to culinary arts. This is a show that I didn\u2019t regret watching as story isn\u2019t always what matters on the menu.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"When a strange door appears in front us, we should enter it with curious expectations, but I bet you, it won't be a restaurant.\"\r\nThe restaurant \"Youshoku no Nekoya\" is known for the different dishes from the menu, but in this case, it is also known by the irregular persons that visit it on the Satur day.\r\nA magical door appears every seven days in different fantasy worlds allowing dragons, elf, dwarfs, human heroes and a select diverse group of lucky creatures to vist a restaurant from other world and taste all flavors that can not be found in their lands.  \r\nYour first impression could be\"the story is weak and lacks action.\" However, the story doesn't need action, fights, war, etc.  The story's strength is in the attention to the details of the dishes, the feelings about the dishes, the taste, the flavors, the texture, and the background of the restaurant visitors. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, it was nice seeing how the fantastic characters converged on a simple restaurant and they were able to create a small background of each one with some few minor stories or plot lines. \\n\\n\r\nThe story has lots of characters, but they are unique and different. We can see some differences between each other. They like different dishes, they look different, and they came from different worlds. The design of each character varies. For example, there is a lion beast, and you could end seeing some drunk dwarf. The only relation that they have is a restaurant door even if they are from the same world. When they enter it, they are prepared for the worst, but they understand that is a place with fantastic food and different clients. It was excellent seeing that if a character goes to other \"areas\" or another kingdom, it could meet characters from the restaurant. That attention to the details of the writers is the strength of the show, call me silly, but that's how a great story is done. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a principal character. Perhaps, the human Chef and the two waitresses (demon and dragon) are the most important characters for the story. They received a bit more background than the general characters. They share the same feelings towards the restaurant, the food and they enjoy working there.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound mix is good. We aren't going to complain about it. The OP song \"One In A Billion,\" is amazing. You will have that rhythm and lyrics inside your head for some hours.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. I thought with the constant character changes the art could have a degradation of quality but no. The art and design use a vast color palette, lighting, and differs on the locations. The details of each character even if it appears a couple of minutes was outstanding and focus on the origin of the character. Those details, the combination of few plotlines, and a small story creates a character background.  (Hope that the people from TROYCA and Re: Creators learn something from this animation. You can build a character with motion and few plot lines, lesson learned). \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the story could be boring to several spectators seeking action, but this anime isn't for everyone. Also, it isn't bad changing the genre from time to time and relax a bit while you enjoy some different short stories connected with the restaurant. I will recommend this show but with a small advice, do not expect fights, wars, etc. The animation focuses on the dishes and their description, the feeling from each character towards a different flavor and savor.",

            "content": "Isekai is a very tiresome genre.\u00a0 Quite honestly with all of the new 'transporting to a new world' adding only one or two arbitrary things in order to make it unique, the concept just appears...lazy.\u00a0 So, now we're gonna transport a restaurant to another world.\u00a0 And...it's actually pretty good.\u00a0 Huh.\r\nStory: There are legends of a strange door that appears all over the world on the day of Satur known as \"Western Restaurant Nekoya\".\u00a0 Within the door lies an establishment that takes in gold and silver coins in exchange for food not seen or known to others.\u00a0 Marvels like curry, parfaits, and natto that people havenever seen before.\u00a0 It is a gift, a strange magical occurrence wrought about by fate.\u00a0 At least that's how I expect someone from the 'other world' to explain whatever's happening.\\n\\n\r\nWith the plot point of an oak door inexplicably showing up in random places all over a fantasy world really never being touched on in the series, ever, the plot of Isekai Shokudou focuses primarily on the stories of its patrons as we're shown their dining experience in the restaurant and get a glimpse at what this 'other world' is like.\u00a0 In essence, the entire show is centered around world building with the restaurant being the centerpiece that draws in all of these beings from all walks of life to come and tell their story and reaction to the food.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's it.\u00a0 That is literally the entire show in a nutshell.\u00a0 The show's simplistic nature is definitely its one and only strong point because each week brings about something new for the audience to watch due to vast variety of characters that come in through the restaurant's hallowed door.\u00a0 It's a story that could be regarded as boring to some, but ultimately is a relaxed experience that didn't need to be high octane due to how well its formula worked, despite the formula being incredibly stale.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Simple story\\n\r\n+ Tons of worldbuilding\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Can be boring for some\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The nameless chef simply known as 'Master' is really just a figurehead to the whole thing.\u00a0 Rarely does the show ever focus on him, and when it does, is very little that it's clear that we're only getting a small sample of something that could be developed more.\u00a0 The amount of detail he gets is ok, and it does actually explain the inexplicable door if you infer enough liberties, but selfishly speaking, I would like a little more detail.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that slight problem, the rest of the cast is rich and vibrant with a whole host of fantasy beings eating in a place that has a menu somehow large and diverse enough to satisfy and feed the desires of so many different patrons.\u00a0 (All prepared and cooked by only one guy no less.)\u00a0 While remembering everyone's names is virtually impossible, the one takeaway is the audience coming out of every episode having heard a new story or event involving the restaurant.\u00a0 Each A part and B part of an episode focuses on someone different, thus making the formulaic setup for the show all the more enjoyable because in one episode, you could be seeing a treasure hunter reminisce about her grandfather, and in another, you're watching lizardmen do a ritual.\u00a0 As a result, every episode feels fresh and different, making the viewer coming back wanting seconds to know who's gonna show up in the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+\u00a0 Very good side cast\\n\r\n+/- Wish the master got more attention\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Silver Link, Isekai Shokudou has a bright and glossy look to it with rich and bright colors to accentuate the entirety of the show's fantasy image.\u00a0 Despite that, movement is rather limited in this show, as the calmer feel of the show seemed to divert all of the budget from animating movement to the quality of the characters and backgrounds.\u00a0 Not to say that's a bad thing, but it's the show itself seems to have an overall lack of character movement because you're basically watching a bunch of people and creatures eat rice omelettes and curry, so anything beyond brisk walks and sitting down is too much to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the food.\u00a0 It is very high quality.\u00a0 It also makes me hungry.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ High quality, clean art\\n\\n\r\nSound: Both the show's OP and ED compliment the two combined aspects of the show's centerpiece: the fantasy element and the homely element.\u00a0 \"One In A Billion\" is an energetic, bright piece that evokes the show's fantasy feel and the kind of wonderment that these beings have when they embark on a journey into a strange place they've never been to.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, \"Chiisana Hitotsubu\", the show's ED, is a somber piece with a soft piano beat as a sort of cap off to the visual meal that the show presents.\u00a0 It's a satisfying piece that has its merits present with how, like many, the restaurant's regulars have attachments to the foods that they order when they visit.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, satisfying tracks\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Despite this being one of the shortest reviews I've written in recent years because the show is so easy to explain, Isekai Shokudou really isn't something that I can really detail without meticulously picking apart and explaining the twenty four to twenty six individual stories that the show features.\u00a0 It's such a simple yet flexible concept that I can't help but want more.\u00a0 It's relaxing, it's satisfying, it may be formulaic, but it's still good.\\n\\n\r\nWhat did I like about this anime?\\n\r\nHonestly, the lizardmen one is probably my favorite of the bunch.\u00a0 Iunno, it's just really amusing to see how they created an entirely new ritual for the arrival of the door.\u00a0 Also Lionel's was pretty satisfying too.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\r\nI wish Kuro was given the time of day.\u00a0 She shows up so late in the series and really doesn't make as much of an impact as her coworker does.\u00a0 (Granted Aletta did have more time.)\u00a0 I just wish we got more with her because she was too amusing to not have more of.\u00a0 Also a number of the later stories aren't as well written as some of the earlier ones.\u00a0 Also I wish the show gave us at least one scene with all of the regulars showing up at once and rambunctiously associating with one another.\u00a0 Cause the restaurant always looks so empty with the show having only the featured character story be the only patron in the restaurant at one time.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\r\nIf you want something healing, Isekai Shokudou is a great fit.\u00a0 Again, the show is very formulaic.\u00a0 Week after week it's the same thing.\u00a0 But every story is different and there's a sense of progression as more and more regulars enter the establishment and start sitting among the new arrivals.\u00a0 It's the kind of storyline leaving you hungry for more with each new episode that really makes the show interesting and fun to watch.",

            "content": "Isekai Shokudou is a special anime, is not an anime you would expect to have an epic story or something like that. It is just relaxing, like any other Slice of Life should be... Well, it doesn't exactly have the tag of Slice of Life, but pretty much feels like its meant to be taken as such. So if you are here expecting an epic story or a really meaningful anime, you will only get dissapointed. Now, if what you want is something different than your usual  Harem, Ecchi, Generic Anime, or something not as lewd as Shokugeki no Souma, this anime will bea good ride for you. It still has some sort of fanservice, but not as invasive as other shows.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Overall Section\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect much from the story, the only thing you need to know is that there is a door that leads to a restaurant, a door that connects other worlds and that only opens once each 7 days (in the day of \"Satur\"). But, even if there isn't much of a story, the world building of this anime is pretty exquisite, each episode you will get to know about the different races that lives on the other world, featuring Sirens, Beastmans, Princesses, Elves, Dragons, Mermaids, Lizardmans, or just any other kind of adventurer that finds the door. Its like the kind of \"rest area\" you will find when you play an RPG game, its serves no purpose over the story but to let you rest and buy things for your journey (in this case food) overall, due to the lack of a significant plot, the story goes by 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest point of the art on an anime like this, are the dishes, how tasty they look, how appealing they look, and the impact it does when a customer eats it. But not only that, as for the world building, there are some places on the other world that are pretty beautiful for the eye to look at (this is were the \"relaxing\" part comes into play) so meanwhile you hear a fitting soundtrack and beautiful landscapes, you will probably find yourself eating something (I admit, this show can make someone hungry lol) while hearing how the characters are reacting to the occasion. What gives me more curiosity is the moon of the other world, which its quite shattered and looks like something bad happened there. Overall the art goes by 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBoth OP and ED are okay overall. I like the voice acting in general, I didn't find myself hating a character over its Seiyuu or any other kind of annoying sound, the soundtrack does a decent job portraying the landscapes that we get to see when we are exploring into the character's past that comes from the other world. I find myself at ease when hearing to the OST of this anime, so the Sound department goes by 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere aren't that much of significant character development, the characters are there and serves for world building while they are being introduced to the restaurant. Maybe the most mysterious character is this \"Wilhelm\" which is the one that founded the restaurant. Aside of that, Aletta and Kuro are very likable characters. Aletta is a low-tier demon that always wanted to be useful on whatever she finds for a job, sadly, demons aren't that well received on the other world, but thanks to this restaurant, she finds more confidence for herself and starts having a good time on the other world. As for Kuro, she is one of the dragons that lives on the other world, she is introduced a bit late in the show, but she is still an important character, she's commanded by the red dragon to protect the restaurant from bad people. She's very skilled in a certain amount of areas, like speaking to the mind of the customers or having strong resistance to curses, so she pretty much is a good addition to the restaurant, since she can do both, protect the restaurant, and customer service. Overall for the characters, 7/10 might be good\\n\\n\r\nSo again, if you are into this slice of life kind of anime, you will surely enjoy this anime for what it has to offer, there isn't much, but quite enough. As enjoyment value, a 8/10 will do the job for those that looks for something different rather than the usual you can get to see on a season\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: Relaxing, nice world building, gorgeous landscapes and food, and a nice character cast.",

            "content": "Isekai Shokudou is shockingly, relentlessly boring. There's a mundane, quiet restaurant; it has a magic portal that's branches out to a bunch of corresponding portals in a sword and sorcery fantasy world. A rotating cast of fantasy guest characters come through the door. They eat food and then leave. Back in fantasy isekai land, they do have stuff going on; this is explained through direct narration or maybe some clumsy expository dialogue. But it's just back story. The restaurant visit does nothing at all to resolve the off-screen tension (except in one case where the guy's big problem was... he hadn't eaten in a while.)They enter, order, eat, enjoy, and leave. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nI want to be crystal clear about this because weeb apologists may think I'm just bored with slice-of-life drama, or a show about cooking, and wanted to see violence and strife. No. I wanted to see any kind of conflict, problem, or question; and then I wanted to see how it was resolved, or how the attempts to resolve it failed, and how that led logically to new conflicts, problems, or questions. In other words I wanted something that conforms to the basic essentials of a dramatic presentation. But this show doesn't. It fundamentally violates the implicit pact between author and viewer because the author is an incompetent amateur web novel guy who has no idea what he's doing.\\n\\n\r\nPeople, this is unacceptable. Stop enabling this kind of garbage. Yes, the author didn't understand his craft; yes the studio adapted a failed, forgettable web novel and shot it scene-for-scene instead of reworking it into an actual story. But the ultimate blame lies with the fans who swallow and even praise these unnecessary, failed projects. Go take a grade school English class. If you pay attention you'll understand why this isn't good storytelling. It isn't storytelling at all.",

It isn't trying to be a complicated and convoluted story; Trying to excite and amaze you like Food Wars, something the show gets compared to due to the nature that the centerfold is cooking. Instead, Restaurant is simply trying to leave a heartwarming feeling of people simply just enjoying food.\r\nEach character introduce has their own unique backstory and how they suddenly stumbled upon the mystical door that connects the two respective worlds and are all respectively unique in their own different ways. But thepoint of the anime isn't character's unique backstories. The point is to simply enjoy the fact that...they're enjoying.  The enjoyment of this show simply comes at seeing other people enjoy good food. A heartwarming 24 minutes each week. There's no complicated plot. No plot-twist. Gimmicky plot-devices. Just an Isekai based around a restaurant that opens once a week where we're introduced to characters that enjoy the food of the restaurant.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something just..euphorically heartwarming and will overall just leave a smile on your face, Restaurant is definitely the anime. No complicated plot. Just simply the enjoyment of seeing others enjoy.",

            "content": "Do you like short stories that don't have much of a point but may serve as a nice lighthearted vignette? Do you like watching people gush loudly about how much they enjoy the various types of food that they are eating? Well if so Restaurant To Another World might be for you! If you don't it most certainly won't be.\r\nWhile Restaurant To Another World has a nice atmosphere and does well to protray a comfy setting, it's only purpose are the two things I mentioned: short meaningless vignettes that can sometimes be heartwarming, and watching people gush over the food that they love eating somuch. While it does those two acceptably, there really isn't much else to this story. None of the main characters are developed. They have an episode half or two that gives them a little bit of character but for the most part they are ultimately unimportant. Just people that you get to know as you get to see the various walks of life that frequent the restaurant. \\n\\n\r\nThe various walks of life aren't very fleshed out either. While we are introduced to important bits of their character for that segment, this does very little but give a general sense of who this character is. In many cases, this character could be one of many others that would be able to fit into the role. Ultimately their personality doesn't matter and isn't explored. They are rather a tool to dig into what one type of typical fantasy character might enjoy at this restaurant. And due to a decent amount of the episode being decidated to their love and eating of the food in question, this limits even more the characterization that the characters get. While there are a couple who get developed to an amount that at least makes them a character, most of them are not.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories usually aren't that much to write home about either. Most of them follow the same ordering. First a problem or a character point or some sort of starting idea will be introduced. Then that character will find the door or will think about when they found the door. Then they'll visit the restaurant and proceed to gush over the food that they chose to order. If it's their first time they'll express disbelief about how for some reason this restaurant shouldn't be able to do the meal they want well before turning into putty when they experience the true power of the food that they soon devour down. And then they order seconds, thirds, and as many helpings as they possibly can. While this can get very boring and predictable, I will note that there are times where the show is able to use its formula well and tell an interesting or heartwarming tale. Although some of its better tales are when it ditches the formula and decides to go more freeform, espeically when it involves the main cast. The episodes surrounding the demon girl in particular were able to carve a nice simple heartwarming story. The type of story I had hoped and expected to see more of from the show. \\n\\n\r\nRestaurant To Another World also can have the bad habit of trying to gimmick up some of its shorts in order to cover up it's formula some. However this only makes it worse as the while the formula isn't too annoying the gimmicks almost always are. There is one part in which it tries to present itself like a documentry. While it's a novel idea it ultimately fails to bring enjoyment because documentaries are best for when someone craves knowledge in a subject matter. It's hard to crave knowledge into a fictional subject matter that as a viewer I didn't even know about until that episode started. With no curiousity being built, there isn't any pay off.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are both fine. They're both good for the atmosphere that the show is trying to envoke and thusly I think that ultimately they work. Although the OP is very out of place. Personally I'm actually quite fond of the sound cue that they use each time someone comes across the door. It's unique and it makes a sort of recurring sound that adds to the comfiness of the work. I tend to like traits that are allowed to be reused and be familiarized to the audience. It's like a little special trait to itself, and that's pretty cool! \\n\\n\r\nOverall I feel one's enjoyment of this show is really going to depend on the answer to those first two questions. If you want to watch people love and nom on food, or if you like short comfy but meaningless stories you'll probably enjoy this despite it not having the best characters or story. But if you don't  like that or don't really care for it, it'll seem tedious and repeative, as that's really the meat of what it has to offer. Personally I'm not the biggest fan of either. While I can enjoy meaningless short stories if they resonate, they rarely did for me. While I certainly understand there is an audience for this I am firmly not that audience as the flaws outweighted the strengths of the show for me. As a potential viewer you'll have to make the decision yourself. Do you think short comfy vignettes and food love can outweight it's lack of character or story depth? If so give a try. If not you're probably better off looking for another show.",

It is interesting to see how this feeling of hunger can change people's mind drastically. This hunger can make people do any and everything...no matter who it is.. a salaryman or a  beast .\r\nThe anime \"Isekai Shokudou\" is a bout a western cuisine restaurant , Nekoya , which seems to be a regular restaurant , serving  normal food to people all day, six days a week. But there is a secret. During a weekend, the restaurantbecomes a eatery for customers from different worlds and races... serving them the same regular food, which on the other hand is somewhat exotic for the non human customers. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime shows how a person... be it a human or a beast, is ready to throw away his pride and sit in front  of the table , just to enjoy a good meal. Its also about how its is just a single bowl of good food required to win a person's heart.\\n\\n\r\nAll of The characters are really good and likable. Besides the main cast, it is also interesting to watch all the different customers and realize how despite being from a different race... behave so much like humans when it comes to food. The setting and all the characters together make it a really enjoyable and heartwarming story.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art , being done by silver link, is really beautiful and color palette  also matches the theme of the story. The character design is also pretty near but also feels somewhat bland and generic... tho is still not bad. The music... is just amazing ... the OP and Ed are really good and one just doesn't simply skip them.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, The anime is actually good. The concept of the show is really interesting.. but with just 4 eps out as of now, there is not a whole i can say about. The show treats all its characters really well  with respect which is not something we often see. I would really recommend this show to everyone one if u haven't tried it already.\\n",

In an attempt to create new opportunities for their pursuit of bliss, humans seek out numerous things in order to avoid duties. After all, effort leads to fatigue, which is nothing else than a detriment for one's enjoyment, right?\r\nIn Restaurant to Another World the viewer follows beings from a typical fantastical setting. It's a world where dangerous foes, social inequalities, and incurable diseases are issues its inhabitants face on a daily basis. Weeks pass, but their demanding lives don't get easier. Be that a life of a gladiator, squaring off against countless enemies to earnhis freedom, a sole survivor, enduring a solitary existence on a parlous island, or a stray demon, cast away by the society due to her origin, their lifestyles are far from ideal.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of this, they can still find pleasure and comfort in their challenging, yet steady lives. All thanks to Nekoya: a magical eatery, whose doors appear throughout their universe only once a week, on the day of Satur.\\n\\n\r\nNekoya by human standards, does not deviate from the norm. Simple dishes are served in simple ways; it's a typical western restaurant on the outskirts. The otherworldly creatures, however, perceive each course as a heavenly gift. Curry, ice cream, fried fish, steamed potatoes and many others provide intense experiences incomparable to any other. A meal\u2014consumed countless of times before\u2014brings forth a sense of joy and satisfaction on their rigid faces. An entire week's severe workload gone in a matter of minutes. Not much can compare to such gratification.\\n\\n\r\nThe cook himself, however, sees the restaurant's menu as being anything but exceptional, understanding that despite the feelings it leaves in its patrons, its crudity can be noticed by anyone familiar with the real-life cuisine. Similarly, binge-watching Restaurant to Another World can lead to feeling blas\u00e9. The lack of intrigue, absorbing characters, worthwhile art or music leaves it with only its noncomplex emotional resonance, which relies purely on avoiding the aforementioned feeling. The show puts a high emphasis on the fact that, just like the food served at Nekoya, its simplicity is supposed to be enjoyed seldom, allowing for its message to persist longer, as well as give the person receiving it time to utilize it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that effort, it still can't avoid the results of its bare-bones presentation. The always present redundancy will inevitably cause the viewer to grow bored, defeating the purpose entirely. Unfortunately, following the most popular anime format, it opted out for twelve episodes, rather than a one-shot OVA or a shorter season. The lengthiness damaged what could have been an uplifting and memorable story, turning it into a forgettable piece of animation.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, although the show's messages are genuinely worth experiencing, it is hard to recommend\u2014finishing it will grow gradually more tedious, which can suppress everything it's trying to convey. It knows about this, but doesn't attempt to create a captivating experience, instead settling on a monotonous repeat of everything that it already said. The strength its idea possesses is far from enough to carry a twelve episode show on its own.\\n\\n\r\nSo ultimately, what you really need to know is that you should enjoy your morning sandwiches more, faggots.",

This is by far one of the most underrated anime this year and I'm gonna tell you guys why you should watch it.\r\nFirstly, It has a similar vibe to another show this year called \"Demi-chan wa Kataritai\" and if you love that show, you're going to love this. \r\nThe story is nothing special and that is a good thing, just because it's an \"isekai\"  genre, that does not mean it should beover the top, a death-defying adventure that we all have seen it all over and over again. It doesn't need it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character is so simple, it makes you wanna know more about this world.\\n\r\nEvery week is a treat me, we're not only getting new food but new people too. A new character, new background story and every single one of them is interesting on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is nothing special, just a generic song we all have seen it in other types of anime BUT the ending song was a masterpiece. I immediately in awe when I first listen to it, definitely an ending you don't want to miss.\\n\r\nPlus, the background instrument is so soothing and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a good show, super fun to watch it alone or with a company and I highly recommend it to anyone, I mean anyone who still hasn't watch it yet.\\n\\n\r\nLook, I'm not a good writer or reviewer, I have watch Anime for more than 20 years and when a really good show comes, I just hope more people would give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost forgot, always eat first before watching the show and enjoy.\\n",

            "content": "Spoiler Free Review\r\nEveryone loves food, it's something we can't survive without. Instead of being a necessary chore that keeps us alive, it's an opportunity for innovation as many chefs around the world are experimenting with ingredients, trying to create the next great dish. Food is made to be eaten and enjoyed, and these culinary artists are the ones allowing us to take joy in our food. Now, Isekai Shokudou is not a show about creating new recipes. All the food showcased in this show are stuff we've seen or heard of before. You won't be seeing much deviation from these dishes, but that isn't technicallya bad thing. Isekai Shokudou focuses more on enjoying food than making it, adding an extra spin to the show by having all the customers as people that come from a fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nThe restaurant Youshoku no Nekoya has a mysterious magical door that appears during every Day of the Satur. The door shows up in a variety of different locations in a world separate from ours, allowing a variety of races and beings to visit the Nekoya and order anything from its menu. From lizardmen to dragons and back to normal humans, Isekai Shokudou is separated into 2 arcs every episode, showcasing a different story and set of characters, new or old, for each arc. Now there are problems that arise with this type of formula, but as the show progresses it manages to sort out these issues in a matter of episodes. The mystery of how Tenshu is able to continue running a thriving restaurant when he gets paid with a currency from another world is answered quite simply, the main characters that were simply there to make and serve food get a bit more exploration to allow us to see them as actual characters, and the lack of interaction between customers is fixed with the way they interweave different character stories together and the conversations between certain characters inside the restaurant.\\n\\n\r\nWith all the other problems are dealt with, the only two remaining are the difference in enjoyment and interest between character stories, and the lack of screen time some characters get. Most of the time, the stories told in Isekai Shokudou are simple but engaging enough to be entertaining, but there is the occasional time where a story just doesn't quite hit the mark and you get a little bored with the show at certain times. The number of characters the show introduced is quite a lot, and while there are ones that we get a better look into, there are also the few that appear once and are never really touched on again, leaving some customers to feel like just another mouth to feed instead of an actual person with their own lives.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the actual eating scenes, it's a lot of the same you see in other anime. A character takes bite after bite of their food as they monologue over how good it tastes and the amazing chemistry between the ingredients. The art style is pretty simple, as a lot of time is spent on making the dishes look good. Each recipe served looks fantastic and sparkles with deliciousness, providing pure eye candy to lovers of food porn. A food anime's job is to make you hungry and long for great tasting food, and this show fits the criteria pretty well. Now, this is not something everyone will enjoy. Some want action and drama from their anime, while others prefer a relaxing and soothing feeling as they watch shows. It depends on what type of anime fan you are that decides whether this is the type of show for you.\\n\\n\r\nIsekai Shokudou is a relaxing experience that doesn't rely on any exciting plot to make you enjoy what it has to offer. However the show does try to take on too many characters at a time, and that plays into the occasional quality drop the show has. However, it's still a perfectly enjoyable experience with very likeable characters, so for the people that would enjoy this type of anime, it's a show worth digging your teeth into.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for Reading, Send Feedback if You Have Any!",

            "content": "Isekai Shokudou was so much better than I expected. At first it does not look really appealing, however I enjoyed it a lot. This anime is perfect for those who want a relaxing time to just enjoy a new world where each episode is filled with new characters to get to know better. \r\nStory: 9/10.\r\nThe story is about a restaurant known as the \"Restaurant to Another World\". A normal restaurant on earth that is connected to another world via a door. This door appears on the day of Satur: aka on Saturday. The door appears in random locations to the other world where people fromthe other world come to enjoy the food from earth. Each new episode we get to meet different races and people, and we get to know about the story of these people. For each new episode we get to know more about the other world and more about the people that live in it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10.\\n\r\nThe art is a classic anime style with some great details to the food and characters. It is not by the art that people are drawn into this anime, so we don't expect it to be astonishing. But still well done!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10.\\n\r\nThe intro music is quite good and it makes me feel more relaxed compared to a more aggresive music. Since this anime is not a action anime I think the music is a perfect fit. The sound is very well done and you can't really complaine about it. The voice actors are really good and have a lot of experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10.\\n\r\nFirst off we have Tenshu the chef. He is a middel aged man who have seen all types of races from the other world and won't be suprised by any of them. He loves to make food so that others can enjoy it, and that is why he works as a chef. We also have Aletta. She is from the devil race but was cased out because of her small hornes and poor magic powers. She then started working in the restaurant after being homeless for a while. She is a nice character that no one can dislike. The thing that makes me love the characters in this anime is that they put so much focus on letting us know them. Each episode we are introduced to another character from the other world, but we also get to know the previous characters more. And that creates a bond between the characters and the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\\n\r\nAs for how much I enjoyed the anime I must say I really loved it. I watched all 12 episodes in one go because I couldn't get enough. The thing that really made me want to watch more was the fact that I wanted to know more about both the characters and the other world. And the fact that each episode a new character made their way into the restaurant really made me enjoy it. A fully fantasy anime without action, is something that is nice to watch every once in a while. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10.\\n\r\nThis anime is definitly something that I recommend after watching a action anime. It was so nice to go from a fully action anime to a fully fantasy anime. I think this anime is underrated and I hope more people soon realise that sometimes a calm anime is fine and relaxing. \\n",

            "content": "Isekai Shokudou may be one of the most \"feel good\" anime of the season. We see the real power that food can have over people.\r\nWhat the show does really well is display the joy that comes from eating food. The experience of ordering food, having it arrive, dissecting it with your eyes, and then tasting everything that comes on your plate. It is a beautiful experience and with Isekai Shokudou, we get just that. Every week is a new happiness as someone gets to experience their favorite for the first time again and again. \r\nThe anime does so much with little set up or overlycomplex plot lines. We do get a bit of an origin story, which allows us to become familiar with the patrons of Nekoya, and those backstories are just enough to help us understand the other characters in the show. I'm glad the show so far hasn't tried anything over the top, such as trying to explain why the restaurant shows up every week. The simplicity of the show adds to the beauty of it. It's about how despite all the different experiences and walks of life that makes up these characters, the single experience of enjoying food connects them all. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is good. I feel we are learning about the MC, the chef I presume, while we also learn about the people he serves food to. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good as well, your typical anime food, which does indeed look amazing. I walk away hungry after every episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also another high point for the anime. The soundtrack is quite nice, really amplifying the overall experience. The music played as the characters eat their food for the first time has to be one of the most beautiful compositions this season. \\n\\n\r\nSo far Isekai Shokudou is enjoyable from beginning to end and I walk away with a smile every time. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a lighter, nicer anime to kill time with, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "How much do you love watching a hungry person shine with bliss as they enjoy an outstanding meal? Your answer is probably also how much you'll enjoy Isekai Shokudou.\r\nMost of the time when a story goes far off the tried and true paths of the countless already told it ends up tangled and stumbling but this is a wonderful exception. Seems odd how all it centers around is showing a glimpse of some human, elf, dwarf or other being and their struggles and joys in another world and culminates in their finding of a mysterious door that takes them to a fine but affordable littlerestaurant in our world where they can forget about their troubles for a while and have the most enjoyable meals of their lives.\\n\\n\r\nAt first it just seems like a random bunch of customers but as their numbers increase so do their occasional little connections with each other. Giving a single side character the spotlight for much of a whole episode is something very few animes manage to do well but here they can grow on you amazingly fast and become a beloved part of the background in just 15 minutes. While the glimpses of the other world are spread too far and wide to overlap very often it still feels like they belong in the same world and it is beautiful, I found myself glued to the screen with far more enthusiasm than I had expected.\\n\\n\r\nThere are occasional factual and continuity errors that could be annoying for really observant viewers, fortunately the mistakes are small enough that even if noticed they're reasonably easy to forgive. Lastly the voice acting and sound in general are terrific, which is probably an important part of why everything connects so well.",

            "content": "Review #8: Restaurant to Another World\r\nStory 7/10 -- Isekai Shokudou established a soothing SOL/Fantasy presence. In the recent increase of Isekai projects, this anime series took a different approach to most animes that have shared the genre the past couple years. This is a solid SOL cooking anime that involves a mysterious door in the world of fantasy. The fantasy world learns the value of our own worlds cooking, and people from all classes and races enter this restaurant in a place of peace. There are several problems in the fantasy world, ranging from poverty to classism. Although rather then having the main characters becomeheroes, they instead stay in the environment of the kitchen, believing that a meal is important to soothe the souls that the door allows to wander in. Issues with this animes story are the lack of development, and lack of details such as the doors origin, balance between having monsters and humans in the restaurant on different days, and the lack of a storyline problem that usually attracts isekai viewers.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 -- The artwork was exceptional, the food quality looked very delicious, and the character design had fine detail compared to the normal cardboard look. The restaurant wasn't anything fancy, but I think its simple interior flowed well with the customers. The kitchen seemed a bit too clean though. The fantasy world was made pretty well. The ruins, art design, scenery, city life, and character detail were very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 -- Soundtrack was average, OP/ED mid tier among last years new adapted shows. The acting and dialogue were good, I thought the cook and staff were professional, but also had some character inside the shop. The different lives of the fantasy characters had good stories and encounters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 -- Isekai animes typically have a lot of supporting characters, and usually several main ones as well. This is one of the few animes you will see where the supporting cast has a larger foundation and importance than the main characters. What Silver Link did well in this series was build an entire world, from multiple kingdoms/locations and connect them all to contrast in this weekly visited restaurant. There was a variety of characters with good stories. Beastmen, elves, humans, nobles, wizards/samurais, the entire variety blended well since they all shared the same passion of this new form of food. Kuro's time is kind of short, but Tenshu and Aletta each have their own story that is revealed and revisited when they meet old and new familiar faces. The simplicity of the main characters, mixed with a heavily contrasted supporting cast made the character development unique, and very positive for a higher score then other animes of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 -- What MAL missed on the genre tag was SOL, and that plays a heavy part in this show. There are multiple cultures, and ways of living, and having an interest in cooking myself, I enjoyed the happiness characters had when they ate at the restaurant. The comedy in this series is subtle, but I found the interactions between characters amusing, as well as the owner keeping tabs on customers, with gold coins and other relics lying in a treasure chest he uses as a register. There really isn't much of a mystery in this series, and I would of liked to know more about the secrets of the restaurant. It's still a very good series to watch, especially if you are looking for unique animes in the Isekai genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 -- What makes this anime very good, is its difference from others in the same genre. The calming atmosphere inside the restaurant, blended with a brilliant fantasy world, make an excellent new recipe that can suit users tastes. Not all fantasy animes need a war, or a sword wielding hero to be interesting. Sometimes its the simple parts of our lives, like eating a delicious meal, that can make a very underrated but pleasant anime series. Isekai Shokudou doesn't have action, it's a Slice of Life series designed to be different, and Silver Link does a great job building memories and bonds when recently the genre has been overused slaying monsters or a demon king.\\n\\n\r\n~Castawayz",

            "content": "The isekai genre is really becoming a hot new trend of recent years. From RPG game settings to being reborn into a fantasy world, it\u2019s a genre that has attracted a lot of attention. One of the biggest shows from last year, Re:Zero really took that to a darker side. It seems these days, isekai focuses too much on fantasy adventures \u2013 the typical story involving survival, battling monsters, or forming guilds. Any fan of open world and MMORPG games knows these formulas as they make up a good deal of the gaming market as well. Then, there\u2019s Isekai Shokudou, a show that takes onthe isekai genre but formulates it into something much more different.\\n\\n\r\nAlso known as \u2018Restaurant to Another World\u2019, the series combines elements of fantasy, slice of life, and cooking. Coming into this show, I didn\u2019t originally have high expectations. I would ask myself, \u201cwhat\u2019s so special about a show with cooking?\u201d That was originally my first impression anyway as the first few episodes introduces the setting and characters. Make no mistake, the series\u2019 title is what it is. The main setting takes place at a restaurant known as the \u201cYoshoku no Nekoya\u201d (Western Cuisine Cat Restaurant). From the outside, it looks rather unremarkable. Still, it\u2019s the inside that may surprise you especially with the delicious dishes it serves. More importantly are the characters that visits and work there.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime consists of a very small cast of main characters. It all begins when the owner of the shop discovers Aletta, a demon girl eating discreetly at his restaurant. Having being rejected by the human world, she finds work at Nekoya and serves as a valuable asset. Joining them is Kuro, a strange black-horned elf girl who serves as a waitress to pay off her bills. Although the show consists of a small character cast, the Red Queen is one other distinguishing character to take notice as she has her own personal reasons to visit Nekoya. With a cast this small, it feels like the show is taking a daring risk to craft any story. To be honest, this show doesn\u2019t have much of a plot as each episode is like a story of its own. The main premise is how this special restaurant brings otherworldly customers on Saturdays each week. These characters ranges from elves, fairies, animal men, and even dragons. From my perspective, the show doesn\u2019t really need to rely on a concrete plot as it demonstrates the ability to entertain with its slice of life content. It achieves this with character interactions between the staff and patrons. While these patrons usually possesses otherworldly features, they behave just like normal human beings. It also helps that the show takes time to get us to know these characters. Some episodes gives us insight about their background stories, the world they came from, and even their origins. As a show that relies much more on its characters than story, it gives more reasons for the audience to care about them. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the show being very lighthearted, it still has some light drama such as fantasy discrimination. It\u2019s why Aletta is ostracized from the human world in the first place. In addition, noble characters such as the half-elf Victoria forbids themselves to marry. On the other hand, dragons are (particularly the elder ones) are worshipped like Gods. To say the least, the cultural drama of the show is just enough to make it watchable but not enough to brew up a story.\\n\\n\r\nNow, how can we forget about the food? After all, it\u2019s what the patrons are there for in the first place. Believe me, this series really knows how to craft its dishes. There\u2019s all sorts of food introduced ranging from meat cutlets, fried shrimp, spaghetti, tofu steak, sandwiches, curry, buns, etc. As you can see, the cuisine is diverse and often adapts with each episode\u2019s style. Each episode has new types of characters coming so each it introduces new food on the menu. I\u2019m also surprised by the realistic details of the food as it looks very credible. The coloring, texture, and context overall make the food very convincing. Add the patrons\u2019 reactions and you\u2019ll quickly understand why.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Silver Link, the anime has a colorful vibe and solid visual quality with its character designs. The fantasy elements is very evident with the otherworldly characters and their different worlds. By character designs, they reflect on high fantasy traits such as with elf\u2019s ears, demon\u2019s horns, animalistic features of the animal men, etc. It\u2019s very stylistic as the show makes them look convincingly as possible. The restaurant itself doesn\u2019t look very remarkable as it has a very simple design, both inside and outside. There\u2019s minimal fan service in this show as it really relies much more on the food to catch a viewer\u2019s attention. Overall though, I think Silver Link got their point across when decorating the colorful style of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say for a fact that the soundtrack of the show will be memorable. It\u2019s mostly lighthearted and hardly noticeable most of the time. What did take my notice is the voice acting especially with Kuro. She\u2019s perhaps the most unique character in the show as she communicates telepathically with others. She also has a stoic personality so stepping into the shoes of such a character is never easy. Thankfully, her role in the show is memorable for those traits thanks to the modern talents of Saori Oonishi. \\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Isekai Shokudou really lacks in storytelling and if you\u2019re seeking a colorful plot, then look elsewhere. Almost every episode feels the same and doesn\u2019t make much attempt to change despite different characters being featured. It\u2019s also a show that can hardly make anyone laugh as its comedy side feels stale. However, I would say this show is recommendable especially if you\u2019re more interested in a slice of life-fantasy anime. Every episode itself has a story and brings together characters to create something worth to talk about. The cooking elements is well-detailed and really offer an interesting side to culinary arts. This is a show that I didn\u2019t regret watching as story isn\u2019t always what matters on the menu.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"When a strange door appears in front us, we should enter it with curious expectations, but I bet you, it won't be a restaurant.\"\r\nThe restaurant \"Youshoku no Nekoya\" is known for the different dishes from the menu, but in this case, it is also known by the irregular persons that visit it on the Satur day.\r\nA magical door appears every seven days in different fantasy worlds allowing dragons, elf, dwarfs, human heroes and a select diverse group of lucky creatures to vist a restaurant from other world and taste all flavors that can not be found in their lands.  \r\nYour first impression could be\"the story is weak and lacks action.\" However, the story doesn't need action, fights, war, etc.  The story's strength is in the attention to the details of the dishes, the feelings about the dishes, the taste, the flavors, the texture, and the background of the restaurant visitors. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, it was nice seeing how the fantastic characters converged on a simple restaurant and they were able to create a small background of each one with some few minor stories or plot lines. \\n\\n\r\nThe story has lots of characters, but they are unique and different. We can see some differences between each other. They like different dishes, they look different, and they came from different worlds. The design of each character varies. For example, there is a lion beast, and you could end seeing some drunk dwarf. The only relation that they have is a restaurant door even if they are from the same world. When they enter it, they are prepared for the worst, but they understand that is a place with fantastic food and different clients. It was excellent seeing that if a character goes to other \"areas\" or another kingdom, it could meet characters from the restaurant. That attention to the details of the writers is the strength of the show, call me silly, but that's how a great story is done. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a principal character. Perhaps, the human Chef and the two waitresses (demon and dragon) are the most important characters for the story. They received a bit more background than the general characters. They share the same feelings towards the restaurant, the food and they enjoy working there.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound mix is good. We aren't going to complain about it. The OP song \"One In A Billion,\" is amazing. You will have that rhythm and lyrics inside your head for some hours.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. I thought with the constant character changes the art could have a degradation of quality but no. The art and design use a vast color palette, lighting, and differs on the locations. The details of each character even if it appears a couple of minutes was outstanding and focus on the origin of the character. Those details, the combination of few plotlines, and a small story creates a character background.  (Hope that the people from TROYCA and Re: Creators learn something from this animation. You can build a character with motion and few plot lines, lesson learned). \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the story could be boring to several spectators seeking action, but this anime isn't for everyone. Also, it isn't bad changing the genre from time to time and relax a bit while you enjoy some different short stories connected with the restaurant. I will recommend this show but with a small advice, do not expect fights, wars, etc. The animation focuses on the dishes and their description, the feeling from each character towards a different flavor and savor.",

            "content": "Isekai is a very tiresome genre.\u00a0 Quite honestly with all of the new 'transporting to a new world' adding only one or two arbitrary things in order to make it unique, the concept just appears...lazy.\u00a0 So, now we're gonna transport a restaurant to another world.\u00a0 And...it's actually pretty good.\u00a0 Huh.\r\nStory: There are legends of a strange door that appears all over the world on the day of Satur known as \"Western Restaurant Nekoya\".\u00a0 Within the door lies an establishment that takes in gold and silver coins in exchange for food not seen or known to others.\u00a0 Marvels like curry, parfaits, and natto that people havenever seen before.\u00a0 It is a gift, a strange magical occurrence wrought about by fate.\u00a0 At least that's how I expect someone from the 'other world' to explain whatever's happening.\\n\\n\r\nWith the plot point of an oak door inexplicably showing up in random places all over a fantasy world really never being touched on in the series, ever, the plot of Isekai Shokudou focuses primarily on the stories of its patrons as we're shown their dining experience in the restaurant and get a glimpse at what this 'other world' is like.\u00a0 In essence, the entire show is centered around world building with the restaurant being the centerpiece that draws in all of these beings from all walks of life to come and tell their story and reaction to the food.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's it.\u00a0 That is literally the entire show in a nutshell.\u00a0 The show's simplistic nature is definitely its one and only strong point because each week brings about something new for the audience to watch due to vast variety of characters that come in through the restaurant's hallowed door.\u00a0 It's a story that could be regarded as boring to some, but ultimately is a relaxed experience that didn't need to be high octane due to how well its formula worked, despite the formula being incredibly stale.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Simple story\\n\r\n+ Tons of worldbuilding\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Can be boring for some\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The nameless chef simply known as 'Master' is really just a figurehead to the whole thing.\u00a0 Rarely does the show ever focus on him, and when it does, is very little that it's clear that we're only getting a small sample of something that could be developed more.\u00a0 The amount of detail he gets is ok, and it does actually explain the inexplicable door if you infer enough liberties, but selfishly speaking, I would like a little more detail.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that slight problem, the rest of the cast is rich and vibrant with a whole host of fantasy beings eating in a place that has a menu somehow large and diverse enough to satisfy and feed the desires of so many different patrons.\u00a0 (All prepared and cooked by only one guy no less.)\u00a0 While remembering everyone's names is virtually impossible, the one takeaway is the audience coming out of every episode having heard a new story or event involving the restaurant.\u00a0 Each A part and B part of an episode focuses on someone different, thus making the formulaic setup for the show all the more enjoyable because in one episode, you could be seeing a treasure hunter reminisce about her grandfather, and in another, you're watching lizardmen do a ritual.\u00a0 As a result, every episode feels fresh and different, making the viewer coming back wanting seconds to know who's gonna show up in the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+\u00a0 Very good side cast\\n\r\n+/- Wish the master got more attention\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Silver Link, Isekai Shokudou has a bright and glossy look to it with rich and bright colors to accentuate the entirety of the show's fantasy image.\u00a0 Despite that, movement is rather limited in this show, as the calmer feel of the show seemed to divert all of the budget from animating movement to the quality of the characters and backgrounds.\u00a0 Not to say that's a bad thing, but it's the show itself seems to have an overall lack of character movement because you're basically watching a bunch of people and creatures eat rice omelettes and curry, so anything beyond brisk walks and sitting down is too much to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the food.\u00a0 It is very high quality.\u00a0 It also makes me hungry.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ High quality, clean art\\n\\n\r\nSound: Both the show's OP and ED compliment the two combined aspects of the show's centerpiece: the fantasy element and the homely element.\u00a0 \"One In A Billion\" is an energetic, bright piece that evokes the show's fantasy feel and the kind of wonderment that these beings have when they embark on a journey into a strange place they've never been to.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, \"Chiisana Hitotsubu\", the show's ED, is a somber piece with a soft piano beat as a sort of cap off to the visual meal that the show presents.\u00a0 It's a satisfying piece that has its merits present with how, like many, the restaurant's regulars have attachments to the foods that they order when they visit.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, satisfying tracks\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Despite this being one of the shortest reviews I've written in recent years because the show is so easy to explain, Isekai Shokudou really isn't something that I can really detail without meticulously picking apart and explaining the twenty four to twenty six individual stories that the show features.\u00a0 It's such a simple yet flexible concept that I can't help but want more.\u00a0 It's relaxing, it's satisfying, it may be formulaic, but it's still good.\\n\\n\r\nWhat did I like about this anime?\\n\r\nHonestly, the lizardmen one is probably my favorite of the bunch.\u00a0 Iunno, it's just really amusing to see how they created an entirely new ritual for the arrival of the door.\u00a0 Also Lionel's was pretty satisfying too.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\r\nI wish Kuro was given the time of day.\u00a0 She shows up so late in the series and really doesn't make as much of an impact as her coworker does.\u00a0 (Granted Aletta did have more time.)\u00a0 I just wish we got more with her because she was too amusing to not have more of.\u00a0 Also a number of the later stories aren't as well written as some of the earlier ones.\u00a0 Also I wish the show gave us at least one scene with all of the regulars showing up at once and rambunctiously associating with one another.\u00a0 Cause the restaurant always looks so empty with the show having only the featured character story be the only patron in the restaurant at one time.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\r\nIf you want something healing, Isekai Shokudou is a great fit.\u00a0 Again, the show is very formulaic.\u00a0 Week after week it's the same thing.\u00a0 But every story is different and there's a sense of progression as more and more regulars enter the establishment and start sitting among the new arrivals.\u00a0 It's the kind of storyline leaving you hungry for more with each new episode that really makes the show interesting and fun to watch.",

            "content": "Isekai Shokudou is a special anime, is not an anime you would expect to have an epic story or something like that. It is just relaxing, like any other Slice of Life should be... Well, it doesn't exactly have the tag of Slice of Life, but pretty much feels like its meant to be taken as such. So if you are here expecting an epic story or a really meaningful anime, you will only get dissapointed. Now, if what you want is something different than your usual  Harem, Ecchi, Generic Anime, or something not as lewd as Shokugeki no Souma, this anime will bea good ride for you. It still has some sort of fanservice, but not as invasive as other shows.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Overall Section\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect much from the story, the only thing you need to know is that there is a door that leads to a restaurant, a door that connects other worlds and that only opens once each 7 days (in the day of \"Satur\"). But, even if there isn't much of a story, the world building of this anime is pretty exquisite, each episode you will get to know about the different races that lives on the other world, featuring Sirens, Beastmans, Princesses, Elves, Dragons, Mermaids, Lizardmans, or just any other kind of adventurer that finds the door. Its like the kind of \"rest area\" you will find when you play an RPG game, its serves no purpose over the story but to let you rest and buy things for your journey (in this case food) overall, due to the lack of a significant plot, the story goes by 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest point of the art on an anime like this, are the dishes, how tasty they look, how appealing they look, and the impact it does when a customer eats it. But not only that, as for the world building, there are some places on the other world that are pretty beautiful for the eye to look at (this is were the \"relaxing\" part comes into play) so meanwhile you hear a fitting soundtrack and beautiful landscapes, you will probably find yourself eating something (I admit, this show can make someone hungry lol) while hearing how the characters are reacting to the occasion. What gives me more curiosity is the moon of the other world, which its quite shattered and looks like something bad happened there. Overall the art goes by 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBoth OP and ED are okay overall. I like the voice acting in general, I didn't find myself hating a character over its Seiyuu or any other kind of annoying sound, the soundtrack does a decent job portraying the landscapes that we get to see when we are exploring into the character's past that comes from the other world. I find myself at ease when hearing to the OST of this anime, so the Sound department goes by 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere aren't that much of significant character development, the characters are there and serves for world building while they are being introduced to the restaurant. Maybe the most mysterious character is this \"Wilhelm\" which is the one that founded the restaurant. Aside of that, Aletta and Kuro are very likable characters. Aletta is a low-tier demon that always wanted to be useful on whatever she finds for a job, sadly, demons aren't that well received on the other world, but thanks to this restaurant, she finds more confidence for herself and starts having a good time on the other world. As for Kuro, she is one of the dragons that lives on the other world, she is introduced a bit late in the show, but she is still an important character, she's commanded by the red dragon to protect the restaurant from bad people. She's very skilled in a certain amount of areas, like speaking to the mind of the customers or having strong resistance to curses, so she pretty much is a good addition to the restaurant, since she can do both, protect the restaurant, and customer service. Overall for the characters, 7/10 might be good\\n\\n\r\nSo again, if you are into this slice of life kind of anime, you will surely enjoy this anime for what it has to offer, there isn't much, but quite enough. As enjoyment value, a 8/10 will do the job for those that looks for something different rather than the usual you can get to see on a season\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: Relaxing, nice world building, gorgeous landscapes and food, and a nice character cast.",

            "content": "Isekai Shokudou is shockingly, relentlessly boring. There's a mundane, quiet restaurant; it has a magic portal that's branches out to a bunch of corresponding portals in a sword and sorcery fantasy world. A rotating cast of fantasy guest characters come through the door. They eat food and then leave. Back in fantasy isekai land, they do have stuff going on; this is explained through direct narration or maybe some clumsy expository dialogue. But it's just back story. The restaurant visit does nothing at all to resolve the off-screen tension (except in one case where the guy's big problem was... he hadn't eaten in a while.)They enter, order, eat, enjoy, and leave. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nI want to be crystal clear about this because weeb apologists may think I'm just bored with slice-of-life drama, or a show about cooking, and wanted to see violence and strife. No. I wanted to see any kind of conflict, problem, or question; and then I wanted to see how it was resolved, or how the attempts to resolve it failed, and how that led logically to new conflicts, problems, or questions. In other words I wanted something that conforms to the basic essentials of a dramatic presentation. But this show doesn't. It fundamentally violates the implicit pact between author and viewer because the author is an incompetent amateur web novel guy who has no idea what he's doing.\\n\\n\r\nPeople, this is unacceptable. Stop enabling this kind of garbage. Yes, the author didn't understand his craft; yes the studio adapted a failed, forgettable web novel and shot it scene-for-scene instead of reworking it into an actual story. But the ultimate blame lies with the fans who swallow and even praise these unnecessary, failed projects. Go take a grade school English class. If you pay attention you'll understand why this isn't good storytelling. It isn't storytelling at all.",

Instead, Restaurant is simply trying to leave a heartwarming feeling of people simply just enjoying food.\r\nEach character introduce has their own unique backstory and how they suddenly stumbled upon the mystical door that connects the two respective worlds and are all respectively unique in their own different ways. But thepoint of the anime isn't character's unique backstories. The point is to simply enjoy the fact that...they're enjoying.  The enjoyment of this show simply comes at seeing other people enjoy good food. A heartwarming 24 minutes each week. There's no complicated plot. No plot-twist. Gimmicky plot-devices. Just an Isekai based around a restaurant that opens once a week where we're introduced to characters that enjoy the food of the restaurant.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something just..euphorically heartwarming and will overall just leave a smile on your face, Restaurant is definitely the anime. No complicated plot. Just simply the enjoyment of seeing others enjoy.",

            "content": "Do you like short stories that don't have much of a point but may serve as a nice lighthearted vignette? Do you like watching people gush loudly about how much they enjoy the various types of food that they are eating? Well if so Restaurant To Another World might be for you! If you don't it most certainly won't be.\r\nWhile Restaurant To Another World has a nice atmosphere and does well to protray a comfy setting, it's only purpose are the two things I mentioned: short meaningless vignettes that can sometimes be heartwarming, and watching people gush over the food that they love eating somuch. While it does those two acceptably, there really isn't much else to this story. None of the main characters are developed. They have an episode half or two that gives them a little bit of character but for the most part they are ultimately unimportant. Just people that you get to know as you get to see the various walks of life that frequent the restaurant. \\n\\n\r\nThe various walks of life aren't very fleshed out either. While we are introduced to important bits of their character for that segment, this does very little but give a general sense of who this character is. In many cases, this character could be one of many others that would be able to fit into the role. Ultimately their personality doesn't matter and isn't explored. They are rather a tool to dig into what one type of typical fantasy character might enjoy at this restaurant. And due to a decent amount of the episode being decidated to their love and eating of the food in question, this limits even more the characterization that the characters get. While there are a couple who get developed to an amount that at least makes them a character, most of them are not.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories usually aren't that much to write home about either. Most of them follow the same ordering. First a problem or a character point or some sort of starting idea will be introduced. Then that character will find the door or will think about when they found the door. Then they'll visit the restaurant and proceed to gush over the food that they chose to order. If it's their first time they'll express disbelief about how for some reason this restaurant shouldn't be able to do the meal they want well before turning into putty when they experience the true power of the food that they soon devour down. And then they order seconds, thirds, and as many helpings as they possibly can. While this can get very boring and predictable, I will note that there are times where the show is able to use its formula well and tell an interesting or heartwarming tale. Although some of its better tales are when it ditches the formula and decides to go more freeform, espeically when it involves the main cast. The episodes surrounding the demon girl in particular were able to carve a nice simple heartwarming story. The type of story I had hoped and expected to see more of from the show. \\n\\n\r\nRestaurant To Another World also can have the bad habit of trying to gimmick up some of its shorts in order to cover up it's formula some. However this only makes it worse as the while the formula isn't too annoying the gimmicks almost always are. There is one part in which it tries to present itself like a documentry. While it's a novel idea it ultimately fails to bring enjoyment because documentaries are best for when someone craves knowledge in a subject matter. It's hard to crave knowledge into a fictional subject matter that as a viewer I didn't even know about until that episode started. With no curiousity being built, there isn't any pay off.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are both fine. They're both good for the atmosphere that the show is trying to envoke and thusly I think that ultimately they work. Although the OP is very out of place. Personally I'm actually quite fond of the sound cue that they use each time someone comes across the door. It's unique and it makes a sort of recurring sound that adds to the comfiness of the work. I tend to like traits that are allowed to be reused and be familiarized to the audience. It's like a little special trait to itself, and that's pretty cool! \\n\\n\r\nOverall I feel one's enjoyment of this show is really going to depend on the answer to those first two questions. If you want to watch people love and nom on food, or if you like short comfy but meaningless stories you'll probably enjoy this despite it not having the best characters or story. But if you don't  like that or don't really care for it, it'll seem tedious and repeative, as that's really the meat of what it has to offer. Personally I'm not the biggest fan of either. While I can enjoy meaningless short stories if they resonate, they rarely did for me. While I certainly understand there is an audience for this I am firmly not that audience as the flaws outweighted the strengths of the show for me. As a potential viewer you'll have to make the decision yourself. Do you think short comfy vignettes and food love can outweight it's lack of character or story depth? If so give a try. If not you're probably better off looking for another show.",

It is interesting to see how this feeling of hunger can change people's mind drastically. This hunger can make people do any and everything...no matter who it is.. a salaryman or a  beast .\r\nThe anime \"Isekai Shokudou\" is a bout a western cuisine restaurant , Nekoya , which seems to be a regular restaurant , serving  normal food to people all day, six days a week. But there is a secret. During a weekend, the restaurantbecomes a eatery for customers from different worlds and races... serving them the same regular food, which on the other hand is somewhat exotic for the non human customers. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime shows how a person... be it a human or a beast, is ready to throw away his pride and sit in front  of the table , just to enjoy a good meal. Its also about how its is just a single bowl of good food required to win a person's heart.\\n\\n\r\nAll of The characters are really good and likable. Besides the main cast, it is also interesting to watch all the different customers and realize how despite being from a different race... behave so much like humans when it comes to food. The setting and all the characters together make it a really enjoyable and heartwarming story.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art , being done by silver link, is really beautiful and color palette  also matches the theme of the story. The character design is also pretty near but also feels somewhat bland and generic... tho is still not bad. The music... is just amazing ... the OP and Ed are really good and one just doesn't simply skip them.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, The anime is actually good. The concept of the show is really interesting.. but with just 4 eps out as of now, there is not a whole i can say about. The show treats all its characters really well  with respect which is not something we often see. I would really recommend this show to everyone one if u haven't tried it already.\\n",

Not much can compare to such gratification.\\n\\n\r\nThe cook himself, however, sees the restaurant's menu as being anything but exceptional, understanding that despite the feelings it leaves in its patrons, its crudity can be noticed by anyone familiar with the real-life cuisine. Similarly, binge-watching Restaurant to Another World can lead to feeling blas\u00e9. The lack of intrigue, absorbing characters, worthwhile art or music leaves it with only its noncomplex emotional resonance, which relies purely on avoiding the aforementioned feeling. The show puts a high emphasis on the fact that, just like the food served at Nekoya, its simplicity is supposed to be enjoyed seldom, allowing for its message to persist longer, as well as give the person receiving it time to utilize it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that effort, it still can't avoid the results of its bare-bones presentation. The always present redundancy will inevitably cause the viewer to grow bored, defeating the purpose entirely. Unfortunately, following the most popular anime format, it opted out for twelve episodes, rather than a one-shot OVA or a shorter season. The lengthiness damaged what could have been an uplifting and memorable story, turning it into a forgettable piece of animation.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, although the show's messages are genuinely worth experiencing, it is hard to recommend\u2014finishing it will grow gradually more tedious, which can suppress everything it's trying to convey. It knows about this, but doesn't attempt to create a captivating experience, instead settling on a monotonous repeat of everything that it already said. The strength its idea possesses is far from enough to carry a twelve episode show on its own.\\n\\n\r\nSo ultimately, what you really need to know is that you should enjoy your morning sandwiches more, faggots.",

This is by far one of the most underrated anime this year and I'm gonna tell you guys why you should watch it.\r\nFirstly, It has a similar vibe to another show this year called \"Demi-chan wa Kataritai\" and if you love that show, you're going to love this. \r\nThe story is nothing special and that is a good thing, just because it's an \"isekai\"  genre, that does not mean it should beover the top, a death-defying adventure that we all have seen it all over and over again. It doesn't need it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character is so simple, it makes you wanna know more about this world.\\n\r\nEvery week is a treat me, we're not only getting new food but new people too. A new character, new background story and every single one of them is interesting on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is nothing special, just a generic song we all have seen it in other types of anime BUT the ending song was a masterpiece. I immediately in awe when I first listen to it, definitely an ending you don't want to miss.\\n\r\nPlus, the background instrument is so soothing and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a good show, super fun to watch it alone or with a company and I highly recommend it to anyone, I mean anyone who still hasn't watch it yet.\\n\\n\r\nLook, I'm not a good writer or reviewer, I have watch Anime for more than 20 years and when a really good show comes, I just hope more people would give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost forgot, always eat first before watching the show and enjoy.\\n",

            "content": "Spoiler Free Review\r\nEveryone loves food, it's something we can't survive without. Instead of being a necessary chore that keeps us alive, it's an opportunity for innovation as many chefs around the world are experimenting with ingredients, trying to create the next great dish. Food is made to be eaten and enjoyed, and these culinary artists are the ones allowing us to take joy in our food. Now, Isekai Shokudou is not a show about creating new recipes. All the food showcased in this show are stuff we've seen or heard of before. You won't be seeing much deviation from these dishes, but that isn't technicallya bad thing. Isekai Shokudou focuses more on enjoying food than making it, adding an extra spin to the show by having all the customers as people that come from a fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nThe restaurant Youshoku no Nekoya has a mysterious magical door that appears during every Day of the Satur. The door shows up in a variety of different locations in a world separate from ours, allowing a variety of races and beings to visit the Nekoya and order anything from its menu. From lizardmen to dragons and back to normal humans, Isekai Shokudou is separated into 2 arcs every episode, showcasing a different story and set of characters, new or old, for each arc. Now there are problems that arise with this type of formula, but as the show progresses it manages to sort out these issues in a matter of episodes. The mystery of how Tenshu is able to continue running a thriving restaurant when he gets paid with a currency from another world is answered quite simply, the main characters that were simply there to make and serve food get a bit more exploration to allow us to see them as actual characters, and the lack of interaction between customers is fixed with the way they interweave different character stories together and the conversations between certain characters inside the restaurant.\\n\\n\r\nWith all the other problems are dealt with, the only two remaining are the difference in enjoyment and interest between character stories, and the lack of screen time some characters get. Most of the time, the stories told in Isekai Shokudou are simple but engaging enough to be entertaining, but there is the occasional time where a story just doesn't quite hit the mark and you get a little bored with the show at certain times. The number of characters the show introduced is quite a lot, and while there are ones that we get a better look into, there are also the few that appear once and are never really touched on again, leaving some customers to feel like just another mouth to feed instead of an actual person with their own lives.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the actual eating scenes, it's a lot of the same you see in other anime. A character takes bite after bite of their food as they monologue over how good it tastes and the amazing chemistry between the ingredients. The art style is pretty simple, as a lot of time is spent on making the dishes look good. Each recipe served looks fantastic and sparkles with deliciousness, providing pure eye candy to lovers of food porn. A food anime's job is to make you hungry and long for great tasting food, and this show fits the criteria pretty well. Now, this is not something everyone will enjoy. Some want action and drama from their anime, while others prefer a relaxing and soothing feeling as they watch shows. It depends on what type of anime fan you are that decides whether this is the type of show for you.\\n\\n\r\nIsekai Shokudou is a relaxing experience that doesn't rely on any exciting plot to make you enjoy what it has to offer. However the show does try to take on too many characters at a time, and that plays into the occasional quality drop the show has. However, it's still a perfectly enjoyable experience with very likeable characters, so for the people that would enjoy this type of anime, it's a show worth digging your teeth into.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for Reading, Send Feedback if You Have Any!",

            "content": "Isekai Shokudou was so much better than I expected. At first it does not look really appealing, however I enjoyed it a lot. This anime is perfect for those who want a relaxing time to just enjoy a new world where each episode is filled with new characters to get to know better. \r\nStory: 9/10.\r\nThe story is about a restaurant known as the \"Restaurant to Another World\". A normal restaurant on earth that is connected to another world via a door. This door appears on the day of Satur: aka on Saturday. The door appears in random locations to the other world where people fromthe other world come to enjoy the food from earth. Each new episode we get to meet different races and people, and we get to know about the story of these people. For each new episode we get to know more about the other world and more about the people that live in it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10.\\n\r\nThe art is a classic anime style with some great details to the food and characters. It is not by the art that people are drawn into this anime, so we don't expect it to be astonishing. But still well done!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10.\\n\r\nThe intro music is quite good and it makes me feel more relaxed compared to a more aggresive music. Since this anime is not a action anime I think the music is a perfect fit. The sound is very well done and you can't really complaine about it. The voice actors are really good and have a lot of experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10.\\n\r\nFirst off we have Tenshu the chef. He is a middel aged man who have seen all types of races from the other world and won't be suprised by any of them. He loves to make food so that others can enjoy it, and that is why he works as a chef. We also have Aletta. She is from the devil race but was cased out because of her small hornes and poor magic powers. She then started working in the restaurant after being homeless for a while. She is a nice character that no one can dislike. The thing that makes me love the characters in this anime is that they put so much focus on letting us know them. Each episode we are introduced to another character from the other world, but we also get to know the previous characters more. And that creates a bond between the characters and the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\\n\r\nAs for how much I enjoyed the anime I must say I really loved it. I watched all 12 episodes in one go because I couldn't get enough. The thing that really made me want to watch more was the fact that I wanted to know more about both the characters and the other world. And the fact that each episode a new character made their way into the restaurant really made me enjoy it. A fully fantasy anime without action, is something that is nice to watch every once in a while. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10.\\n\r\nThis anime is definitly something that I recommend after watching a action anime. It was so nice to go from a fully action anime to a fully fantasy anime. I think this anime is underrated and I hope more people soon realise that sometimes a calm anime is fine and relaxing. \\n",

            "content": "Isekai Shokudou may be one of the most \"feel good\" anime of the season. We see the real power that food can have over people.\r\nWhat the show does really well is display the joy that comes from eating food. The experience of ordering food, having it arrive, dissecting it with your eyes, and then tasting everything that comes on your plate. It is a beautiful experience and with Isekai Shokudou, we get just that. Every week is a new happiness as someone gets to experience their favorite for the first time again and again. \r\nThe anime does so much with little set up or overlycomplex plot lines. We do get a bit of an origin story, which allows us to become familiar with the patrons of Nekoya, and those backstories are just enough to help us understand the other characters in the show. I'm glad the show so far hasn't tried anything over the top, such as trying to explain why the restaurant shows up every week. The simplicity of the show adds to the beauty of it. It's about how despite all the different experiences and walks of life that makes up these characters, the single experience of enjoying food connects them all. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is good. I feel we are learning about the MC, the chef I presume, while we also learn about the people he serves food to. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good as well, your typical anime food, which does indeed look amazing. I walk away hungry after every episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also another high point for the anime. The soundtrack is quite nice, really amplifying the overall experience. The music played as the characters eat their food for the first time has to be one of the most beautiful compositions this season. \\n\\n\r\nSo far Isekai Shokudou is enjoyable from beginning to end and I walk away with a smile every time. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a lighter, nicer anime to kill time with, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "How much do you love watching a hungry person shine with bliss as they enjoy an outstanding meal? Your answer is probably also how much you'll enjoy Isekai Shokudou.\r\nMost of the time when a story goes far off the tried and true paths of the countless already told it ends up tangled and stumbling but this is a wonderful exception. Seems odd how all it centers around is showing a glimpse of some human, elf, dwarf or other being and their struggles and joys in another world and culminates in their finding of a mysterious door that takes them to a fine but affordable littlerestaurant in our world where they can forget about their troubles for a while and have the most enjoyable meals of their lives.\\n\\n\r\nAt first it just seems like a random bunch of customers but as their numbers increase so do their occasional little connections with each other. Giving a single side character the spotlight for much of a whole episode is something very few animes manage to do well but here they can grow on you amazingly fast and become a beloved part of the background in just 15 minutes. While the glimpses of the other world are spread too far and wide to overlap very often it still feels like they belong in the same world and it is beautiful, I found myself glued to the screen with far more enthusiasm than I had expected.\\n\\n\r\nThere are occasional factual and continuity errors that could be annoying for really observant viewers, fortunately the mistakes are small enough that even if noticed they're reasonably easy to forgive. Lastly the voice acting and sound in general are terrific, which is probably an important part of why everything connects so well.",

            "content": "Review #8: Restaurant to Another World\r\nStory 7/10 -- Isekai Shokudou established a soothing SOL/Fantasy presence. In the recent increase of Isekai projects, this anime series took a different approach to most animes that have shared the genre the past couple years. This is a solid SOL cooking anime that involves a mysterious door in the world of fantasy. The fantasy world learns the value of our own worlds cooking, and people from all classes and races enter this restaurant in a place of peace. There are several problems in the fantasy world, ranging from poverty to classism. Although rather then having the main characters becomeheroes, they instead stay in the environment of the kitchen, believing that a meal is important to soothe the souls that the door allows to wander in. Issues with this animes story are the lack of development, and lack of details such as the doors origin, balance between having monsters and humans in the restaurant on different days, and the lack of a storyline problem that usually attracts isekai viewers.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 -- The artwork was exceptional, the food quality looked very delicious, and the character design had fine detail compared to the normal cardboard look. The restaurant wasn't anything fancy, but I think its simple interior flowed well with the customers. The kitchen seemed a bit too clean though. The fantasy world was made pretty well. The ruins, art design, scenery, city life, and character detail were very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 -- Soundtrack was average, OP/ED mid tier among last years new adapted shows. The acting and dialogue were good, I thought the cook and staff were professional, but also had some character inside the shop. The different lives of the fantasy characters had good stories and encounters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 -- Isekai animes typically have a lot of supporting characters, and usually several main ones as well. This is one of the few animes you will see where the supporting cast has a larger foundation and importance than the main characters. What Silver Link did well in this series was build an entire world, from multiple kingdoms/locations and connect them all to contrast in this weekly visited restaurant. There was a variety of characters with good stories. Beastmen, elves, humans, nobles, wizards/samurais, the entire variety blended well since they all shared the same passion of this new form of food. Kuro's time is kind of short, but Tenshu and Aletta each have their own story that is revealed and revisited when they meet old and new familiar faces. The simplicity of the main characters, mixed with a heavily contrasted supporting cast made the character development unique, and very positive for a higher score then other animes of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 -- What MAL missed on the genre tag was SOL, and that plays a heavy part in this show. There are multiple cultures, and ways of living, and having an interest in cooking myself, I enjoyed the happiness characters had when they ate at the restaurant. The comedy in this series is subtle, but I found the interactions between characters amusing, as well as the owner keeping tabs on customers, with gold coins and other relics lying in a treasure chest he uses as a register. There really isn't much of a mystery in this series, and I would of liked to know more about the secrets of the restaurant. It's still a very good series to watch, especially if you are looking for unique animes in the Isekai genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 -- What makes this anime very good, is its difference from others in the same genre. The calming atmosphere inside the restaurant, blended with a brilliant fantasy world, make an excellent new recipe that can suit users tastes. Not all fantasy animes need a war, or a sword wielding hero to be interesting. Sometimes its the simple parts of our lives, like eating a delicious meal, that can make a very underrated but pleasant anime series. Isekai Shokudou doesn't have action, it's a Slice of Life series designed to be different, and Silver Link does a great job building memories and bonds when recently the genre has been overused slaying monsters or a demon king.\\n\\n\r\n~Castawayz",

I mean which anime has a badass looking Dragon Queen that actually isn\u2019t bad?\r\nAnd the MC, wandering into private property and isn\u2019t exaggeratedly flustered (every anime ever) when the owner finds out?\r\nI\u2019d say this anime isn\u2019t reallyplot driven and focuses more on the main context in the title. Food. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very calm and has a nice pace to it too!\\n\r\nTruly a hidden gem and if you read this, I highly recommended it.",

            "content": "Out of all of the serials I watched this season, Restaurant to Another World would have to be one of my favourites. It was feel-good and dangerously hunger-inducing.\r\nIn the corner of a local shopping district lies a Western-style restaurant called Y\u014dshuku no Nekoya (Western Cuisine Cat Restaurant). During its business hours, Monday through Friday, it serves normal food to normal folks. The restaurant is normally closed on weekends and holidays. However, on Saturdays it secretly opens its doors to very unique and unusual clientele from some very unique and unusual locales.\r\nThe most disappointing part of this entire series was the severe lack of kitty cats.The restaurant\u2019s name has the word \u201ccat\u201d in it. The least they could have given me was a little feline mascot!\\n\\n\r\nI just had to get that off of my chest. Aside from that, it was such a fun and delectable series. It\u2019s set up in an anecdotal means with episodes that don\u2019t connect plot-wise. The story itself is simple and straightforward: it\u2019s about a fancy restaurant that caters to diverse, fantastical races from varying planets, and the different ways that these folks come across the Nekoya.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the delicious and breathtaking dishes that are served at this restaurant, my favourite part of the show consisted of the characters. Even with it being episodic in nature, the anime does a phenomenal job of being character rich and exhibiting stories that share motifs of strength, overcoming grief, loneliness, and insecurities, just to name a few. The experiences that so many of the clientele undergo vary from light-hearted to tender to deeply emotional. There\u2019s an underlying warmth in the hardships they all over-came during their lives that I found to be very comforting and inspirational. Their trials and tribulations are reflected in the foods that they come to love dearly.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, we have a lion who was beaten and taken into captivity as a slave where he was forced to fight for his freedom. His favourite dish is katsudon. It\u2019s a dish with lightly fried meat, usually pork, over rice with eggs. The dish helps rejuvenate him and helps him to gain his strength. Thus providing him an advantage, which he uses to obtain his freedom much faster than anyone believed possible. His story also provides a lesson in not judging someone by their appearances as monsters can be hidden within even the most genuine looking folks.\\n\\n\r\nThere is another story that revolves around a young girl who used to visit the restaurant with her grandfather where they\u2019d eat parfaits. After he passes away, she falls into depression and her physical health begins to suffer. She\u2019s a very lonely young woman. One day after coming across the magical door, she\u2019s taken to Nekoya. The memories associated with the restaurant help inspire her to get healthier. She begins smiling and laughing a lot more, and the overall quality of her life improves drastically. That was one of the episodes that resonated the most with me.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the stories in each episode truly make the series worth watching. It\u2019s an all-around feel-good, heart-warming anime. If that\u2019s not enough to peak your interest maybe the animation will be. It\u2019s beautiful, especially where the food is concerned. Every single dish they showed, even if it was something that I\u2019m allergic to or cannot eat like pork, made my mouth water. I made the mistake of watching this on an empty stomach one evening. My tummy roared louder than my cat! However, when I watched it after having dinner with a full belly, I still found myself desperately hungry for whatever was being shared in the episode.\\n\\n\r\nI think my biggest complaint, aside from there being no kitty cats, is the mystery behind Nekoya. How did it come to exist in a way that allows it to reach different dimensions, as well as different planets? What is the secret behind this unique capability? A part of me wishes it was discussed in the serial, but another part of me really appreciates the enigma. In a way, it adds to the charm.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be not super spectacular, but it\u2019s a decent show that is worth watching, especially if you\u2019re in the market for something that is uncomplicated, savory, and compassionate.\\n\\n\r\n7.5 sandwiches outta 10!",

If you're looking for a new Slice of Life anime to watch then this would have most of the things you would expect from the genre. There is little to no story progression here but the way the story is presented, with each customer often getting there own little spotlight when they are introduced, makes the story a little more intriguing than your usual Slice of Life anime. Speaking of characters, I think one of the main sellingpoints of the series is the characters. Learning about their quirks, backstory or even just what they were doing on the day prior to reaching to the restaurant is entertaining to see from week to week. Another strong selling point for Isekai Shokudou is how great the art is, in particular how great the food looks. I almost always make sure I have something in front of me to eat when I settle in to watch an episode. I then subsequently want to shed tears of disappointment when whatever I'm eating at the time isn't at the level of what Tenshu prepared that episode.\\n\r\nIsekai Shokudou is a relaxing anime you can end off your day with and is one I can recommend.",

Instead, the chef is a chef who cooks normal food to characters that have never had such food, which is probably how many of us felt when we try a new food that we end up enjoyingso much.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nGoing into this I was expecting a ripoff of Food Wars, instead what I got was a restaurant filled with interesting people and food you'd definitely want to try.\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe story is the weakest aspect, but I don't think a story was really necessary here, the episodes are just random interactions with characters from a fantasy world, who happen to discover a mysterious door that leads them to a restaurant, which makes food from our world and each of these characters have a specific dish they like, that's pretty much it.\r\nAt first I thought this was a little dull, because even the moreprominent characters don't get much focus, however the more I watched, the more I started to enjoy it. Mainly because I liked the amount of characters that were introduced showing how expansive this fantasy world was, along with the excellent reactions and descriptions they give for the dish they try.\\n\r\nAlso if you came here thinking there would be an end goal to this show, there really isn't, the last episode just felt like another episode and despite ending on a happy note, I didn't feel fully satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were definitely an interesting part of the show, although with the amount that there is, it's kinda hard to keep track of them.\\n\r\nThe MC's are Tenshu, Aletta and Kuro, these 3 characters are the ones who work in the restaurant and provide the other interesting beings their meals, however each of these 3 are different in personalities, Tenshu is the man in charge so his personality came off as wise, but also humble since he cared about the customers enjoyment instead of money.\\n\r\nAletta, a half demon girl who doesn't have a very easy life, is a waitress in the restaurant, she is a very happy girl who doesn't really let much get her down, but she is also fascinated with the food that Tenshu makes and how different it is from her own world.\\n\r\nKuro, a dragon who also becomes a waitress, doesn't show up until after the halfway point, yet the screentime she still has made her a relatively interesting character, she rarely spoke with her mouth, instead using her mind which did make her a little intimidating, she does become a little more open to the others by the end.\\n\r\nNow all the other characters aren't memorable, but they do hold some worth to the show, I do like how each character who discovers the restaurant have a backstory leading up to it, which shows how big this fantasy world is.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe is definitely the strongest aspect of the whole show, the detailing of the food was top notch and made me want to have those same dishes, it's kinda funny how anime can make food more delicious than it is in real life.\\n\r\nThe design of the characters were pretty good too, each person looked different and unique, plus I liked the variety of characters too, Dragons, Demons, Sirens, Fairies, Dwarfs, Lizardmen, Elves, Mermaids, along with the normal humans this fantasy world had a lot to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op strangely enough was damn enjoyable, definitely one of the better ops I've heard this year, it had that fantasy feel to it, while also having a catchy tune to keep you interested, the soundtrack wasn't too bad either, it had some bits that stood out to me like the Siren's piece which nicely fitted the moment.\\n\\n\r\nExtra's:\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery element of the show was done well, since it captured the reactions of new customers who had no idea what this place was, along with their reaction to the food that they have never encountered before, it was fun seeing how these strange people would react to something they had no idea existed.\\n\r\nThe comedy was ok, I could definitely tell this show was desperately trying not to ripoff Food Wars orgasm scenes, it did well despite a few moments where some of the characters did have a moment like that, I also enjoyed some of the arguments the customers had with each other, as they kept arguing which dish was the best, hell most of an episode was devoted to an argument about Sandwiches, which seemed pretty stupid, but looking back on it, it was funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a nice and simple anime, if you're a fan of Food Wars or just food in general you might enjoy this, although I would recommend watching this after you have filled you're belly, otherwise the show would make you get up and cook something just to satisfy yourself.",

            "content": "Isekai Shodukou, let's hear some food reviews from creatures from another world!\r\nWhat I found interesting in Isekai Shokudou was not the genres in particular, but how the balance between the cooking and isekai genres was well maintained. Another point is that, even though the characters were not closely related, they are still indirectly related to one another, giving the show much more substance than just tossing out new characters in each episode. \r\nThe plot in itself is already a gem. I find myself content with how intricate it actually is (but the base of it all just revolves around a restaurant, as the title implies).It might not seem much at first, but it has a lot of information that you could dig deeper into. In other words, most of the episodes contain at least several pieces of information that could pique your interest. Also, the storyline can keep you entertained for a while even though it is a slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the things mentioned earlier, the conceptual framework of the parallel universe has little or insufficient information that could give a solid foundation regarding the lore of their 'fantasy' world. It only tackles the surface of something that could have been a whole new level of Isekai. Either way, regardless of its ambiguity when it comes to the general behavior and beliefs of the creatures, it is still acceptable to the point that it feels quite relevant, considering that the audience has already seen other Isekai shows, or at least thought of a parallel universe. \\n\\n\r\nAnother wonderful thing is the art; it has this certain professional feel to it, so simple yet so refined. I cannot fully express how much I appreciate the quality of the artwork and animation of it. Although it is not perfect because there are several frames that require a bit of understanding (which would usually go unnoticed, unless one is very nitpicky).\\n\r\nIn addition to that, the sound component of this anime, in general, is appropriate for the mood required in the scenes. ....\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Here's a list of pros & cons to this anime in general\\n\r\n+very fluid animation\\n\r\n+refined art with good color blending\\n\r\n+has nice soundtracks and appropriate sound effects\\n\r\n+has diverse character races/kingdoms with  plausible isekai theories\\n\r\n+/- has isekai as a base genre, and SOL and cooking as the main focus\\n\r\n+/-contains sufficient amount of fan service\\n\r\n+/-has no ultimate plot as far as the anime is concerned\\n\r\n-not for everyone\\n\r\n-might not be entertaining to binge watch for some (although I actually finished it in one go)\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, the show doesn't need the audience to have knowledge about random jargon and such... therefore, the viewers can easily enjoy the show just because of its entertainment value-- and of course, don't forget to look forward to the mouth-watering food in every episode!",

Isekai Shokudou has AMAZING music in my opinion that immerses you into the isekai kind of mood. Not only does it get the mood right, it also is extremely catchy.\r\nThe plot had many holes within it, but I do give credit for what they\u2019ve done. Each episode had its own seperate story with every character, that eventually tied to the main plot. I give respect for the effort it took to do that, but some storylines got a little boring at parts and were verygeneric or sloppily pieced together. The good storylines were humorous, engaging, or just interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was pretty good. The exhilarating colors really made the restaurant feel \u201cother worldly\u201d added with all the fantasy-like characters entering into the diner. The art style was very clean, pretty, and well done to make the food and characters look very nice. The food wasn\u2019t on the level of \u201cShokugeki no Soma\u201d but it still was enough to make my tummy rumble, especially with the detailed sounds made for many, many different sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nI lately have been finding anime much less enjoyable than when I first started watching and being excited at the end of the show, but Isekai Shokudou has revived that feeling. On the last episode of Isekai Shokudou, I felt that same excitement from back then, and had that rush of dopamine into my brain from the satisfaction of this anime. I suggest to watch this show for something a little bit different from typical shows(even though it\u2019s just another isekai).\\n",

            "content": "Restaurant to Another World has a pretty basic premise: Once a week, an ordinary restaurant from our world becomes accessible to a different world. Said world is home to just about everything one would expect from a fantasy world: sorcery and knights, elves and dwarves, treasure hunters and fairies, dragons and demons, monsters and royalty, etc. But every week, these many individuals of varying backgrounds come together at the Western Restaurant Nekoya and enjoy a good, heartwarming meal.\r\nFirst, let's get my constructive criticism out of the way. As stated above, this series is not anything revolutionary. And if over the top action, drama, or comedyare what you crave, you're not going to find it here. In addition, the opening theme, while catchy, doesn't really capture the tone of the show as well as the ending theme or most of the songs used throughout the show. Most episodes are also pretty formulaic, and while it does get toned down more as the series progresses, there is a fair bit of fan service (something that I'll admit isn't bad in and of itself) that can feel a bit out of place at times.\\n\\n\r\nNow that that is all out of the way, let's get onto why I adore this show so much. The art style is incredibly beautiful, with each character being distinct and a delight to look at. In addition, each character, while not complex, have memorable personalities and spark great chemistry with one another. The show is also really good at world-building, with each episode giving the viewer more insight into the history, politics, and culture of the other world that Nekoya is accessible to every Saturday. As for the food served in the restaurant...the attention given to the visual presentation as well as how each dish is described upon being eaten is reminiscent of Food Wars.\\n\\n\r\nBut whereas Food Wars is filled to the brim with crazy and intense competition, Restaurant to Another World is about anything BUT conflict. Sure, the customers can get a bit rowdy about which dish they think is the most delicious, but those arguments are easily quelled before they get out of hand. Rather, the restaurant serves as a place where people from different walks of life can come and relish in cuisine they are unable to prepare back home, all within the walls of a safe and relaxing environment. In fact, relaxing is the best way to describe this show. Between the ending theme and the soundtrack used throughout the series, along with the kind and understanding owner and employees of the shop, as well as lovely visuals, the show creates an atmosphere that can't help but put both the customers and the viewers at ease. Western Restaurant Nekoya is the sort of restaurant one would expect Studio Ghibli to open up in their museum: reminding one of the best aspects of their childhood, enabling them to relish their present, and giving them something wonderful to look forward to in the future. \\n\\n\\n\r\nRestaurant to Another World is not the most action-packed show, nor is it the funniest. It's just a simple, heartwarming concept that in my mind is executed brilliantly, simultaneously whetting my appetite and putting my mind at ease. To those who need a good pick-me-up, I cannot recommend this show enough.",

I'd love to watch more food animes, and it's all because of this.\r\nNot to mention the food as always looks stunning, and the opening is just lovely. Lovely as in I would more thanlikely listen to it over and over again. A great tune.\\n\\n\r\nWould recommend.",

            "content": "Just having Isekai in the title doesn't give Isekai Shokudou the same trappings of the genre people have come to dislike over the years. Instead Isekai Shokudou focuses on the simplistic enjoyment that comes from eating food and the satisfaction that comes from partaking in a soothing weekly routine.\r\nThe show is centered around Restaurant with a magical door. Once a week the door connects the restaurant with other doors in a fantasy world. Because of this many people of different races, cultures, species can enter the Restaurant and enjoy it's food. The story begins when a poor half demon comes into the restaurant andis given a job after the owner sympathizes with her.\\n\\n\r\nIsekai Shokudou reminds us the simple pleasures in life. The denizens of the fantasy world, who can only typically enjoy food cooked with their primitive technology, are captivated by what is on offer. Every episode is dedicated to a different dish and to people who enjoy the dish. We learn a bit about the struggles, aspirations, how they discovered the entrance to the restaurant and how waiting every week to enter the restaurant effects them. While the show is episodic at first, soon the lives of the visitors start to connect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter depth is not of the show's strengths however. The show has a large cast considering just how short it is. Thankfully the characters are well realized enough to give them a sense of identity within the context of the show. And as the show slowly starts to connect the lives of the various members of the cast, you get to see them in a new light.\\n\\n\r\nThe Artistic design of the show lacks anything truly unique. The same can be said about the music, which barely stands out. But what the show does manage to do perfectly is nail the atmosphere. It is, for the lack of a better word, relaxing. Watching an episode every week was a joy. And I will miss the show now that it stopped airing. \\n\\n\r\nI can easily recommend the show to people who want something unique.",

I will say without hesitation, \"Its Isekai Shokudou\"\r\nNow maybe some of you will ask why. I know that this anime is not perfect, but that what makes the anime so remarkable for me. From the first episode you should know what will this anime about. Yes its about restaurant that has'bar' vibe. But why bar you ask? Well its because the customer always them again and them again, but as the story going we will know that they has a deep deep story that related each other. It is what makes me awe the show. Knowing what kind of world beyond Isekai Shokudou from each other different perspective are what makes me think its more awesome rather than we watch full one episode of them doing their things themselves and at the end of the episode they will go to Isekai Shokudou to eat and the ending credit starts.\\n\\n\r\nEverytime the scene starts at Isekai Shokudou we know that we will be shown of new menu or food while some of the known food are eaten by their 'master'. What makes such scene success is beside the appetizing art but after they take the first bite and the violin OST played, its just so captivating. I think the music in this anime is what makes the anime success so much, without it, it will not be Isekai Shokudou we know.",

It did offer some sort of introduction or back story to every new character presented each episode and some of the back stories were nice but really the focus of the show.\r\nIf i have to say what was the main point of this show i would say it's the food first, the cultural exchange second and lastly the little interactions between characters and the bits of story offered\r\nCharacters (7/10):\r\nLike i said the show is not really story driven so the characters didn'treally have a lot of development. They merely got introduced some history was provided and then they get to experience the food.\\n\r\nSome characters did have more screen time and are obviously more important than the others and some of the back stories were interesting or fun but it didn't really matter with no story to bring all that together.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (7/10):\\n\r\nThe art was satisfactory environment were well drawn and really colorful. The food as the main focus of the show looked fantastic and extremely appetizing i was drooling most of the time.\\n\r\nCharacter design ranged from shitty to beautiful in a really strange way characters looked horrendous in some scenes especially when a little far and look breathtaking in other scenes\\n\r\nAnimations were not the best the bare minimum of effort was put into them\\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (7/10):\\n\r\nNothing that stands out in the sound track, the OP and ED were kind of nice though\\n\r\nThe voice acting was nice enough but i felt like some of the characters voices didn't really match with their looks\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (7/10):\\n\r\nCalling it food porn would be too much even though the food was the MC of the show it's not \"Shokugeki no Soma\" level. If i had to compare it to another show i would say it's more like Amaama to Inazuma, light hearted and showing people enjoying food. But it didn't focus on the preparation on the food much like Shokugeki no Soma and  Amaama to Inazuma did and laked the story or slice of life aspect (for the million time i say):D\\n\r\nStill it was a really enjoyable show and made me feel hungry the whole time (i was told it was not binge friendly maybe that is why) :p\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)",

            "content": "Every day of Satur, a special door opens all throughout a different world, where this door opens up to?...\"Isekai Shokudou\".\r\nIsekai Shokudou centers around this titular restaurant and sure it might be just the daily lives of the customers who dine here as they try different cuisine from their own world, but LA sees this as something more than LA expected...with a few lulls here and there.\r\nWell, LA might as well start with kitchen staff of Isekai Shokudou, mainly Tenshu voiced by Junichi Suwabe the chef and the two waitresses Aletta voiced by Sumire Uesaka a demon who stumbles upon the restaurant and became a waitressto pay off for the food and learn more about different cuisine and Kuro voiced by Saori Oonishi a transforming black dragon who lives on the moon (don't ask) and like Aletta stumbles upon the door and becomes a waitresses so she can have her fill of chicken curry. Tenshu is probably the most interesting character in the series as by extension the restaurant itself and how the door works, two of the three are explained. Aletta is quite interesting as she looks into the process of making food first hand (as well as tasting it) and how develops with this to make her life much better in the process not to mention all her new contacts she receives for her waitressing. Kuro on the other hand comes rather late in the anime but we do get some world building with her especially when it concerns the Seven Dragons but something about her isn't really explained but that a bit later.\\n\\n\r\nSo what about the customers?, well at first LA thought many of these characters were gonna be one-shot characters and to be occasionally seen at the restaurant, however as the anime went on, they did start to interact with one another and then it kinda clicked to LA that this anime isn't JUST about the food shown in the anime, it shows the blending of culture or clashing of them through it's customers coming to eat at Isekai Shokudou. As such, Sharif voiced by Atsushi Tamaru who wants to romance Adelheid voiced by Reina Ueda under the guise of friendly trade relations and on the other side of the spectrum Sarah Gold voiced by Kiyono Yasuno an adventurer and Heinrich Seeleman voiced by Tomokazu Sugita a noble bickering about which food is better fried cutlets or fried shrimp...yes this actually happens.\\n\\n\r\nLA thinks some of the problems Isekai Shokudou faces however is well explaining things, as such how does the door function, who even made it? to things involving the customers especially due to how many customers coming into Isekai Shokudou, it was even hard for LA to remember which customer had links to what (not to mention characters looked similar at times confusing LA even further at times) which can easily lead to \"who's he/she again?\". Finally LA brought this up but Kuro is kinda a Death Dragon of the sorts lying death in her wake wherever she goes that's kinda why she lives on the moon, then how doesn't everyone just die instantly when she enters Isekai Shokudou (even in her human form?)...it's kinda glanced over.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Silver Link, the animation at best is consistent throughout the anime from some exotic character designs (and some blending together at times) to some pretty accurate looking food which yes, LA kinda needed to eat something afterwards as it's not Shoukgeki no Souma levels but close enough. Nonetheless the animation was detailed and consistent without much to talk about...it's what you expect from an isekai slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, this huge cast of characters are amazing from Yukari Tamura, Shizuka Ito, Reina Ueda, Sumire Uesaka, Saori Oonishi, Nao Touyama and Tomokazu Sugita however LA thinks the problem lies in the how much screentime each of the characters get and it's limited at that, however LA would easily give LA's favourite voice actor to Sumire Uesaka.\\n\\n\r\nIf you expected Shougeki no Souma levels of food porn and cooking...well kinda yes, but that really isn't what Isekai Shokudou is about, it's the blending and clashing of cultures with it's customers in the restaurant, character interactions and the endeavor of finding better food. Sure Isekai Shokudou has it's lulls when it comes to one-shot characters who hardly interact with any of the other patrons but even then Isekai Shokudou does what an isekai slice of life food anime does and it does itself good.",

            "content": "This anime promised a lot in it's two first episodes.\r\nI will review the most importants pros and cons of the serie to make this short and avoid any possible spoil.\r\nPros:\r\n- Cooking anime, and it really likes to play with the viewer's senses of taste+smell+visual of the food. \r\n- Few cliches, mostly a mature show, you won't find childish jokes or moments in this serie. Of course if you are aiming for a mature serie. \r\nFor cooking plus ecchi and shounen i would recommend Shokugeki No Soma.\r\nCons:\r\nREPETITIVE\r\nStory 4/10: \r\nAs i said, first episodes were very interesting, but the following ones didn't really bring anything new, thechapters begin the same way each one of them, which is like this:\\n\\n\r\n A new costumer reaches the restaurant, then u are given a random flashback of his past/actual history, he tastes the food, makes some orgasmic faces, gets happy with the food, and that's the show till now. Not really any plot twists, any unexpected turn or events, or anything that could give some hint about if this show is going somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is average/ decent\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nMost of the appearing characters aren't interesting in any single way, I mean elfs, minotaurs, a veteran warrior, we all have seen this before, bring something new for god sake. Except maybe for the morph dragon/women.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10  (Might go down if the story just keeps going the same way)\\n\\n\r\nIt's interesting to watch if u are hungry or if u want a chill anime without hentai/violent or noisy content, but just that.",

            "content": "The kind but stern Master runs a Western Restaurant \"Nekoya [Cat Shop]\" in Tokyo but during the night something odd happens. Once every Saturday, portals appear in another world that allows its inhabitants to access his restaurant and they are all captured by the taste of the dishes that are completely foreign to them. Even one of the Seven Ancient Dragons that was feared by all. One night, a hungry homeless young girl Aletta who lost her job because her horns gave away her demon blood lineage, ends up wandering into his restaurant attracted by the aroma of some potage he had cooked. Thinking itwas a dream she helps herself and ends up falling asleep there. When the Boss discovers her, he offers her a job and so together, they continue to welcome inhabitants of all manner from the other world to the restaurant.\\n\\n\r\nBased on a light novel series of the same name, I thought it'd be somehow related to another show with a similar title, Isekai no Izakaya \"Nobu\" but it's not. Both are very similar though - instead of a restaurant you have a pub. Granted, Shokudou's light novels came out a year before first so maybe it inspired the pub series.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most food focused shows, it has it's over-exaggerated way of praising food but it's not done in a fun hilarious way like the classic Mr Ajikko or the more recent fan service heavy Food Wars: Shokugeki no Souma. The camera just focuses on the food as we hear lots of words of praise. Art's not bad so it might make you hungry and while the fan service isn't as heavy as Food Wars, it does have your share of brief cleverly censored nude fan service scenes from the pretty ladies. A lot of the cuisine's very common and familar such as omrice and curry you often see in Anime shows. It's quite fun watching the expressive characters from the fantasy world show how impressed they are with the modern day world food. Outside of that, each episode gives you a bit more of a glimpse into the vaguely named \"Eastern Continent\" fantasy world and they also act as an intro to each of the other worldly patrons too but, the desire for food always ends up leading to Nekoya so it's kind of a rinse-and-repeat formula.\\n\\n\r\nSo you could say this is a slice-of-life show set in a fantasy world with everything you'd expect from the world setting being the norm - your usual dwarves, elves, dragons and other familiar mythical beings. The only twist is that instead of an inn they use the modern day restaurant Nekoya to rest up. It's not as fun as say Working! or Blend S because nothing really eventful happens. Nothing really stands out be it the music, world setting, visuals or scenarios. There's no drama and little comedy that was laugh-out-loud good but, it doesn't feel boring either. There are the odd moments that make you smile and it has a good wrap-up to say the least. It's like being a spectator of daily fantasy life as you learn more about the other world which isn't a bad thing.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nMuch like the patrons of Isekai Shokudou, I treat eating at a restaurant as a treat in and of itself.\r\nThe chatter of the other guests immersed in their own conversations. The services that leave everything up to the establishment. The memories made. Restaurants offer me so much that I can\u2019t help but look forward to that next planned visit.\r\nThe biggest reason, of course, is the food. Chicken, steak, hamburger. Appetizers, salads, desserts. The delectable foods found on those menus are already making my mouth salivate just thinking and typing about them here.\r\nWhile I will neverbe able to partake in the meals made within Isekai Shokudou, it at least crafts an anime that any restaurant-going person like myself can no doubt appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nIsekai Shokudou caters to its audience through simple yet effective means. It plates such a feasible and digestible course using three key ingredients: atmosphere, diversity, and theme.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the show blankets its content with a warm, relaxing atmosphere. At its core, Isekai Shokudou is all about how this restaurant from another world invites its guests (and thus the audience) with incredible ease. To make that situation possible, the anime invests a lot of time in the well-being and focus of said guests.\\n\\n\r\nIt starts when a character or set of characters enter through the magic door, the bell ringing out to signal their arrival at Restaurant Nekoya. Aletta greets them, giving them a menu, perhaps some water, and a wholesome smile. Master never forgets a face, too, so he makes sure to catch up with them like old friends would.\\n\\n\r\nThe relaxed mood does not stop there. Any earlier drama waits outside as the guest or guests in question happily scarf down their prepared meal. Reactions and explanations give the content a personal feel for an extra edge of relatability. Then, after getting their fill, they depart with kind words and thanks, already anticipating that next Day of Satur where the cycle begins anew.\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, such a cycle induces unwanted repetition alongside its vital atmosphere since the events almost always boil down to the same happenings over and over save for the different characters. This approach provides Isekai Shokudou with a clear structure and a tangible rhythm, though. Better yet, the anime tenderizes its repetitiveness through its second ingredient: diversity.\\n\\n\r\nBefore getting to that restaurant, the show builds up each trek through the cat-sign door with vignettes of the characters themselves. What they encounter and deal with varies quite a bit as well. One episode may entail a knight running desperately to reach nearby aid. Another episode may follow a skeptical elf. And another still charts a sea captain abandoned on an island infested with chimeras.\\n\\n\r\nThese non-restaurant portions technically do not make up the focus of the show, but they set the table for the next menu item up for order. In fact, in serving up these slice-of-tales tales sliced from many corners of the other side, the anime goes about building a fantastical yet familiar world. A world that reflects or juxtaposes the inner coziness of the restaurant.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes on quite a few forms. Descriptions on separate territories such as the Land of Sand and the Duchy highlight some of the known differences. Cultural details like the use of magic and the mistreatment of those from demonic descent also find refuge among the talking points. Isekai Shokudou even goes so far as to showcase their own version of the Big Bang, complete with a giant chaos monster, elemental dragons, and the origin of man.\\n\\n\r\nAre these nuances towards the world building huge let alone important? No, not really. But they give the anime another aspect to work with beyond the restaurant\u2019s appeal (despite how appealing it happens to be). Moreover, they grill into the final ingredient: a connected theme.\\n\\n\r\nWhere does this theme come from? Well, it derives from the structure and the motifs of the narrative. As the show constantly points out, the door to this restaurant pops up at random wherever it so chooses. A setup that leads to a stream of customers not from one location but from several. However, despite their disconnected lives, many of them find that their paths also cross or crossed already.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a princess\u2019s relatives to a treasure hunter\u2019s job ad, Isekai Shokudou creates such crosses through small subplots of a linked nature. They layer the events of the anime, upholding what took root previously. To the show, it declares that fate finds a way. Or, as Disney would put it, \u201cit\u2019s a small world after all.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nNone of these three distinct ingredients \u2013 atmosphere, diversity, and theme \u2013 impress the palate to the point of awe. Meaning, while they give the dish its strength, they do not leave a lasting impression when the visit finishes. But that does not stop the anime from baking a flavorful meal worth chomping into.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to its visuals, Isekai Shokudou cooks some parts well and dries out others.\\n\\n\r\nOn the tasty side, the show avoids charring its mainstay setting: Restaurant Nekoya. The wooden d\u00e9cor, the soft lighting, the roomy seating layout, the various amenities. Just as the story aims for a relaxed atmosphere, the restaurant itself likewise relaxes the mood through its modern, inviting construction.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also features many a character design thanks chiefly to the many separate guests that find their way to this unbelievable place. Ethnicities, species, builds, ages, and races reach across the board in terms of detail and direction, giving the anime a wide selection of people to highlight. From the lion man of the arena to the dignified half-elf witch in the secluded tower, they each have their own distinct look. Looks that tie back to the anime\u2019s world building through a collective offering of different designs.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, variance exists to some degree when the show moves onto those uncommon glimpses into the other side. Sandy deserts, lush greenery, and dense cities paint their nations as impressive areas to see if one had the opportunity. However, because these areas (understandably) do not take precedence when compared to the restaurant, they do not always receive a lot of focus or detail. After all, the anime must make sure that its core set of events \u2013 what goes down at and within the restaurant \u2013 comes first.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, certain shots of glossy, colorful seas demonstrate that these places can stand on their own artistically. Plus, with the extra focus, dual-rooster reactions become possible despite their absurdity, and the scrumptious-looking meals turn into mouth-watering creations that the audience only wishes they could reach through the screen to grab a bite of for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, these qualities cannot quell many of the misgivings in the artistry Isekai Shokudou encounters the further along the season progresses. While the anime does not have any egregious art errors, it does succumb to low levels of animation and poor presentation. Episode eight takes the hardest hit with a ton of problems: reused scenes, odd cuts, too many still frames, and only mouth movements.\\n\\n\r\nThe drop in the art\u2019s integrity impacts the visuals enough to not only be noticeable but also be a detriment to the overall execution of the show. Thankfully, this blemish does not override the setting, the designs, and the focus at hand, so it still tastes okay, dryness or otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWith every episode of Isekai Shokudou, at least one new character makes an appearance. Moreover, before they arrive or stumble upon the fated door, their backstories commence.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, this situation leads to many of (if not all of) the cast members not having a whole lot going for them. Yes, the audience learns about Thomas and his popularity as a culinary \u201cgenius\u201d and about the lizard man Gaganpo and his charge as the toughest warrior. But these backstories arguably do not give them much to latch onto in terms of intrigue.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s okay, for the anime is not about crafting elaborate characters. Indeed, their varied upbringings and stations in life strike at a thematic element similar to how they did with the story and its small-world ideology. For, despite having these differences, they all demonstrate the same thought: tasty food brings people together.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the plates hit the table, nothing else matters but the succulent grub and the familiar company of likeminded individuals. Granted, they often keep to themselves and argue vehemently over which dish reigns supreme. Yet when a demon, a dragon, and a dude not only exist within the same space but also befriend each other over some yummy eats, the power of food cannot go denied.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of that dude, Master surprisingly receives some small tangential info about him. His major lack of character writing, though, actually makes some sense on a motif level. Normal restaurant goers wouldn\u2019t learn much about the chef that makes his or her food, so it follows that they (and the audience) do not learn much about him anyway. In a way, he\u2019s their guardian angel, delivering them food (with the help of Alleta and Kuro of course) to satisfy their appetites and keeping himself out of sight to let his expertise do the talking.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Master cannot guard against Isekai Shokudou and its amnesia. Looking at every character involved, several disappear after their introduction or hardly have a presence from then on. Both Thomas and Gaganpo from earlier fall prey to this outcome. Others do as well: the dwarves Gilem and Gard, the sailor Roukei and the mermaid Arute, the harpy guy Arius and the harpy girl Iris.\\n\\n\r\nThese listed characters appear later in the series, meaning they justifiably have little time to come back into the fold. Even so, the anime doesn\u2019t do right by them when it goes without any follow-ups to their inclusion and doesn\u2019t do right by itself when they also do not obtain the same interconnected feeling that the story likes to tout.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, though, the cast members are not truly the point of Isekai Shokudou. Rather, their varied backstories and their common thread on food matter most. So, despite their lackluster individualism and their potential disappearances, the characters serve their purpose well enough within this simple story.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nIsekai Shokudou finds further success with a hefty amount of execution in its musical offerings and sound direction.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOne In A Billion,\u201d the anime\u2019s opening track, kicks off each episode in perhaps an unlikely way. The high energy and the fast-paced composition contrast with the laidback, relaxing mood that the show meticulously forms. Through this dichotomy, the multiple vocalists and the catchiness of the piece overall make for a lot of fun and liveliness that prep the listener for the same traits that Isekai Shokudou touches on when its comes to chowing down on some good grub.\\n\\n\r\nSwinging towards the complete opposite side, the ending track \u201cChiisana Hitotsubu\u201d takes on the familiar tone set by the show. Gentle piano keys and a soft orchestral arrangement capture the sincerity and the gratefulness with which the characters (especially Aletta) hold towards this lovely restaurant. A strong vocal performance refines the emotions, too. Altogether, this track guides the audience gracefully out the door with an earful of a wonderful song, outdoing the bellyful of an anime that preceded it.\\n\\n\r\nBetween the OP and the ED, the clattering of utensils on plates and the bustling sounds of the kitchen ring out within the restaurant. This standard audio design, though, doesn\u2019t speak of its grander and lesser attempts.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, in episode nine, the royalty half-siblings from the Land of Sand gain a slight echoing effect to their voices as they pass under an enclosed space as a cool little detail during their conversation. Conversely, in episode ten, the leader of the fairies has what can only be described as a weird audio clip where she seems to get abruptly cut off for no other reason than poor editing.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting performances also fall under the standard category but, unlike the sound design, do not have any notable examples one way or the other. However, the original soundtrack of Isekai Shokudou is all positives with its calm pieces and more orchestral melodies that boost the relaxing, mellow vibes. Of special note, its signature (albeit overused) piano-and-cello ensembles that play before and during the eating segments dance in the air with a welcome aroma.\\n\\n\r\nTo put everything as a metaphor, the OP and the ED are two slices of white bread that contain the cheese and the salami that is the OST. That makes for a nice sandwich. And, if the audio design and VA performances were a sweeter type of honey-mustard sauce as the side, it would have made the whole lunch here as great as it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nFunnily enough, I see myself in these food-crazed characters. To reiterate my beginning anecdote, I love going to restaurants. But, believe it or not, I too have the same habits when it comes to menu choices and eating guidelines.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll find one, maybe two items that I become very fond of. Then I always order them on subsequent visits. Sure, that makes me unadventurous in a sense, but I cannot pass up that tender filet or that multi-ingredient mac \u2018n\u2019 cheese if they are there for the taking. Basically, my nickname would most certainly be Mr. Chicken Tender.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I related pretty heavily to what the show showed, I wasn\u2019t invested in much else. Almost nothing very exciting or very interesting caught my attention in the events portrayed, and the characters themselves weren\u2019t the most engaging. Specifically, I wished that Kuro could have had more screen time. I liked her design and her backstory and her telepathy. So, her halfway-through-the-season arrival and subsequent low presence was not to my liking when it seemed as though she could\u2019ve sparked new life into the show.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the anime had an aura of simplicity that I can appreciate. And, after watching it and writing about it, I find myself quite hungry now \u2013 so it deserves at least some props for that.\\n\\n\r\nIsekai Shokudou serves a dish brimming with mild success. A straightforward yet well-structured story, a solid artistic direction, a big set of cast members, a handful of swell audio tracks, and a relatable premise. Definitely enough flavor to treat its patrons.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, three ingredients in a warm atmosphere, a helping of diversity, and a theme on this \u201csmall\u201d world support the narrative even if these individual items do not impress outright\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Fine, a cozy restaurant setting, a wide range of character designs, and glossier focus cook up the order, but noticeable artistic troubles dry out the visuals\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, while some guests sadly go forgotten or hardly reappear again after their introduction, their varied backgrounds demonstrate that food has a way of bringing people together\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Good, a lively OP, a sincere ED, and a mellow OST make for a nice sandwich, but the grander and lesser audio design decisions as well as the average VA performances make for a less-than-ideal honey-mustard sauce\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, Mr. Chicken Tender can totally relate\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "A show with tons and tons of potential with most of it squandered.\r\nI think me and just about everybody that watches this will agree that the world is more interesting then the restaurant. Seeing this alternate world is  really interesting and is one of the best parts the show has to offer. Viewing the world is leaps and bounds more entertaining then listening to various diners say \"Hmm, Delicious!!\" or \"What is this !?! \" That really is a majority of the people talking.\r\nI feel the show was trying to achieve the feel and atmosphere that the show \" Blend S\" Managed to achieve.It doesn't work here though cause in \"Blend S\" The show isn't based around people praising the food and the restaurant It's placed around the workers and the friendly atmosphere. In  Isekai Shokudou most of the show is just about people giving the same reaction to eating food. It fails and it's noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe Chef is kind of boring and not interesting. I think it'd would be more fun if he gave more exasperated reactions then just \" Sure thing !\" Or \" Alright \" He is not interesting and lacks any real sense of personality. I think it would have been more fun if the entire restaurant had one of the great Dragons running it. \\n\\n\r\nFirst episode i watched didn't leave me with much hope. From first characters we see to the introduction of the first waitress. I feel like everything could've been done better.\\n\\n\r\nI feel that the introduction of the waitress could have been done so much better.\\n\\n\r\nAletta: \\n\r\nIf we got to see the Aletta walking around the capital being abused and discriminated against with her being turned away from anywhere she goes. Have something sad or really tragic happen to her and have her on deaths door from malnourishment and a year or two of being abused and rocks thrown at her or have her contemplate ending her life from such a long time of abuse. Have the chef come across her collapsed or about to end her life and him help her out. She will then start working at the restaurant. \\n\\n\r\nAlternatively you could have some mystery to it and have a Young girl walking around some ruins and finds Aletta collapsed or contemplating Death. She takes her to a door that will help her. It later turns out that the Young girl that helped Aletta was her mother that Aletta hasn't seen sense she was a toddler. The mother is rarely seen and is always helping the girl out. Aletta doesn't get a hint as to who the young girl is tell near the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nKuro:\\n\r\nI like. Just from her backstory alone i think puts her above the rest of the characters. I'v always been a sucker for loner type stories. I like that she is a Dragon of Death yet she is way to kind to the point she secluded herself on the moon so she doesn't hurt anyone. I feel the entire story could've been about the Dragon Girl finally coming down from the Moon and exploring the Human world and see how it's changed. Let us see her find out how the people view the Dark Dragon ( Her but she's in Human form ) Let us see her being depressed over people hating her Dragon and people actively preach the Dark Dragon is evil. Then let us see her be really down and she eventually comes across a restaurant out in the country side and she ends up working there with other female workers. None of them knowing her true identity tell the end of the show with all of them in the end accepting her. But through out we'd see her using her amazing powers to stop people causing trouble to the restaurant. I'm genuinely kind of sad that we will never see a story like this and that the story had a golden chance to do something amazing with her but they squandered it. \\n\\n\r\nI really like the idea of both Kuro and Aletta being really friendly to each other with both of them having close to the same background. The show kind of hints at the Chef having a Crush on Kuro. I don't think it's awful in all honesty, But i feel a relationship between Kuro and Aletta together would fit much better.\\n\\n\r\nAka no Joou:\\n\r\nShe is criminally underused same with Kuro. Her character design kind of looks weird. I don't know what it is but it's just eh. My first thought when i saw her was:\\n\r\n\" Man this would be awesome if some god or something punished this great dragon that's lived longer then Humans have been around and transforms her into a 15 or 16 year old human girl. With her being cursed as a Human and most her power locked away she ends up having to look for work with her money taken away. With her being turned away from most places for her not knowing how to properly talk to humans like your on equal footing. She then gets hired be a restaurant filled with other girls that look her age. We then later find out that Kuro works at that restaurant on her own free will ( It'd would kind of be like my idea for Kuro i mentioned ) So pretty much the restaurant is full of supernatural people.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall i think this is an alright show that has tons of wasted potential and i'v always thought that wasted Potential is worse then no potential.",

            "content": "A Niche Within a Niche within a reverse Isekai. People who are into Food Anime and have always wanted to see the genre represented through the perspective of fantasy characters will probably love this.\r\n---Description---\r\nThe show revolves around the restaurant, which is apparently located on earth and accessed via a magical door that opens in different locations throughout a fantasy world on Saturdays. Fantasy characters will usually encounter this door, travel to the restaurant, and be so awestruck by the quality of the food that they repeatedly visit and count down the days until the next \"Day of Satur\" ; Some have apparently even made areligion out of it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe story feels a bit weak to me. However, I recognize that a large part of that is because this isn't my genre. It does a good job at what it's trying to do, however sometimes customers described food in ways they should lack a frame of reference for. \\n\\n\r\nThe customers often get fleshed out backstories and their own little contained adventures that can make the show enjoyable to watch even if this isn't you're genre. There are also comedy and slice of life elements, but the main focus of the anime is definitely on the Restaurant and it's Food as experienced through the perspective of the customers.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI started to give the art a 7, because it's all well drawn but in an industry standard sort of way, but then I realized that the art work on some of the food is exceptionally detailed, and the detail of the restaurant went beyond my first glance impressions of it. Even though this isn't my Genre I respect it's commitment to what it does.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe sound is about average for the industry and good enough to keep the anime enjoyable.  None of the music is memorable but the ambiance is appropriate for most scenes. The Anime does do a good job at allowing characters thoughts about the food and the restaurant to be heard clearly without obtrusion. Sometimes volume levels may be slightly inconsistent in places, but not enough for most to notice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe characters get fleshed out through their own backstories and some of them are interesting but what the main focus is ultimately on how they experience the restaurant and the food, which it does a very good job at inexplicable frames of reference aside.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI would personally give this a 5 because I did not enjoy it very much. I mainly just watched it because I had nothing else to do. However, I recognize that I am not the target audience for this Anime, and if I were I would probably be enjoying it a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nI estimate that if this were my niche, I would want to give it an 8, but I would subtract a point for the fact that fantasy characters have inexplicable frames of reference that they should not have.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nIt's a good Anime, and if you like the genre then you should definitely see it.",

            "content": "Welcome to the Resturant to the Other World. \r\nSTORY\r\nThe premise of this anime is that every seven days, the door to Nekoya will be open to the other world. Simple enough. Each episode is divided into different parts focusing on one new character and the kind of food that they experience when they enter Nekoya. The story doesn't really have any development or conflict. And I have to say that is totally fine. \r\nThe anime does not need any sort of plot to it. The reason for that is because it focuses more on the detail of the food. The details about the food andthe people that experience it are what drive the story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nAmazing. Just amazing. And I mean the food. Like the attention to detail for the food is amazing. Reminds me a lot of like Shokugeki no Souma. And I mean it is a cooking anime so you need to have good visuals for it. And luckily this anime does. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nEach and every character is unique from design to personality. I enjoyed each and every one of their reactions to when they are served food and when they try the food for the first time. What I find funny is that these are regular customers but the moment that they start trying the food, they act like food critiques. I mean, if it were me and I tried the various food from that restaurant, I would just say it was delicious and just keep eating happily. I wouldn't really make an in-depth analysis of the food and all that.  Just something that I found funny. But it is what drives the anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It was very relaxing and I just could not wait to see what the next dish would be and who the next customers would come and visit. I really wished that there would be more episodes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. This anime doesn't necessarily need the plot to drive it. It is the food that drives the story. Everything surrounds the food that is presented in each episode. And I am totally fine with it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a relaxing anime to watch, I highly recommend this one. Just don't watch it on an empty stomach.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Here we get to see the various preference a person make when he first visits an eatery for the firsts time which meets their preferences.\r\nStory- The anime doesn't specifically have a story. As it goes around with slice life type of style with each episode introducing any two food type along with the characters preferences shown with each episode.\r\nArt- It's great and watching kinda mademe remember about shokugeki no soma and the location scene was great as what we would expect from a usual another world transportation anime \\n\\n\r\nSound- the music was calm and comforting resulting being able to provide the essence of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-well we get know about every thing as the story progress and this method of revealing us step by step was also great to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I enjoyed it very well ,while watching its every moments the show  bought me a smile before I could realize what I was doing. There was no story to begin with but their day to day interaction was kinda amusing especially to see how they react when the eat was like feast for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- I would recommend this to someone who want to watch gourmand anime with an out of the world cast . It would calm your mind and set you free from any kind of thoughts other than the satisfied faces of the character.",

When you work the food aspect into it, its really a beautiful Slice of Life anime.\r\nArt and Animation: Honestly I have no complaints. The visuals are stunning and the animation is top notch.\r\nSound: I freaking loved the music that played when these people would eat food. From the slow moving violin to the fast paced piano the music synced up perfectly with everything going on in this anime. Sheer brilliance.\r\nCharacters: You have your three main characters in; Master, Aletta and Kuro who are all awesome. Master becomes even more awesome during episode 12. (And added incentiveto watch this whole anime) Then you have your customers, all who have awesome backstories or current situations going on in their lives currently that are basically washed away once they enter the restaurant.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I thoroughly enjoyed watching this anime every week. The food looked delicious and I felt the writing was pretty accurate for what different species and races would want to eat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I know this is not a Masterpiece I would give it a 10/10 my score, but looking at it as an overall it is no lower then an 8/10.",

            "content": "This is a great series to just sit down and unwind. To watch characters from different background all enjoy a simple meal is the main charm. It is refreshing from the usual food anime with a slice of life element to it. The characters introduced in the series have enough background story and how they discover the restaurant or their favorite dish. I think it works because this anime knows what its about.\r\nBut it has a few flaws that I can't get pass. Mainly the animation and art. While it is not one piece bad, it is still noticeable and it takes me out ofthe moment. The generic character design isn't inherently a bad thing since it makes animation much easier and allow more fluid movement. But even with the simple design, some characters move as if they are in 3 fps shot. Its as if the studio doesn't have enough time to animate, which is concerning because despite its predictable story it still retains a charm to draws me to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost is generally good although repetitive especially since all character who ate the food always have the same piano score on it. The sound of characters take a bite is off as they make sound that quite frankly if it isn't there, would make a more effective scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime is enjoyable and great for people who are bored of the current season tittles where so many high stake story gets stale. But the animation flaw is glaring so I doubt people can binge watch the series.",

            "content": "Note: This review is based on the anime alone. I have not read the source material.\r\nStory (12/30):\r\nIsekai Shukudou is nothing more than a collection of common Japanified western dishes (called youshoku), the people who like them, and the backstory of those people. The \"another world (isekai)\" setting allows for more fantastical story settings, but in the end most of the stories are rather shallow, and the focus inevitably turns to the food and what the inhabitants of this fantasy world thinks about them. \r\nCharacters from past episodes sometimes show up as backdrop or do limited interaction with new patreons, and on very rare occasions crosspath in their fantasy world as well. But that's about the limit of a coherent story -- for the most part each story is short (half an episode) and discrete, which leaves a trail of undeveloped and forgettable characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are no serious faults, I'd give an under-average score for the lackluster story.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/20):\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this Anime does its job, but little more. The restaurant setting means that most scenes within are static, but there's rarely much action outside of the restaurant either. Characters are decently drawn, if a tad low on framerate. However, as a food-centric anime, it certainly did its utmost to ensure everything looks tasty, and the food has proper texture and \"physics\". I certainly commend it for this fact.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/20):\\n\\n\r\nThere's very little to be said about the sound -- the OST blends nicely into the background, to the extent that you won't notice it's there, and totally forgettable. The OP and ED are standard fare for such anime, again neither one are particularly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (25/30):\\n\\n\r\nFor all its mediocre-ness, I actually enjoyed it more than many other anime. It's format and light nature makes it great to watch while eating (don't watch it without food nearby), and there's really no plot to remember or follow. \\n\\n\r\nIt also reminded me of how it felt like eating food in Japan -- just looking at some of them brought back fond memories, and I added quite a few things I'd like to try out on the next visit. That's certainly something rare to come out of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (57/100 = 6/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe isekai restaurant setting could have been used to showcase many good stories, or even as a platform for some social commentary. But instead the focus was placed on food and food alone, which is a shame and IMO a lost opportunity. It had been somewhat enjoyable for me, but I'm not sure that applies to everyone.",
