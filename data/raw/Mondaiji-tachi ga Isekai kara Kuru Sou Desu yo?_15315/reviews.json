            "content": "Have you ever had one of those moments where after you finished watching an anime series, you got a feeling of \u201cdamn, I wish I had finished this sooner?\u201d Or maybe, after you finished watching it, you thought, \u201cthis NEEDS a season 2\u201d. Well, I'm sure most people who have one of those moments sometimes in their lives after finishing watching a certain series. It can be something based out of enjoyment, something fresh or unique that you never originally thought you'd encounter, or maybe just something that was just hell out of a right whether subjectively or objectively. Regardless though, this series known asProblem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They sure hit one of those marks because I got one of those moments.\\n\\n\r\nMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? (also just known as Mondaji for short) is an anime series adapted from the light novel of the same name. The series takes place in a fantasy world featuring four prominent characters. I have not read the LN version of this anime so I came into this with a fresh start. But from what I got was more than just a fresh start but rather a pleasurable experience. \\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate things, the majority of the series takes place in a fantasy world. More specifically though, it focuses on the \u201cNo Name\u201d community, a place where there is trouble loose. It's up to our protagonists to help save their world after being invited by a flamboyant rabbit. Sounds strange right? This is obviously supported by the fact that the protagonists themselves are troublemakers. Take for example, Sakamaki Izayoi. He is portrayed as the badass and arrogant young boy. He does what he wants, when he wants, and how he wants. In general, he is a 'problem child'. His love for violence can be seen earlier on even from the pilot episode when he gets involved with some other kids. Yet behind that outer ulterior, we can see that Izayoi is a boy of intellect through his strategic thinking and ways of dealing with problems himself. At even one point, one of the main characters admits that \u201cyou really are smart\u201d directly. Despite his arrogance though, Izayoi does seem to care about his comrades and dangerous events as he puts himself at risk. The way he expresses it though...not so much being the 'nice guy'.\\n\\n\r\nThat of course only makes up one third of the trouble making trio.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the group are also two young girls named Kudo Asuka and Kasukabe Yo. They seem to exist in opposite of personalities as Asuka seems to be play the role of a girl who has a more open personality while Kasukabe Yo maintains a more quiet posture. This is even evident through Asuka's ability where she is able to command others through speech. And of course, they join in the fun after the faithful day when they are asked to help with problems in the 'No Name' community. In fact, all three of these characters seems to be bored of their normal day lives and seek a bit of joy. There's no better place to do that in the 'No Name' community.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which now, I almost forgot to introduce that certain bunny-eared girl. With fluffy ears, a shy personality, but a heart of determination, she invites the trouble makers to stop the trouble. So without further ado....let's introduce that Bunny Girl...Kurosagi! Literally translated as \u201cBlack Rabbit\u201d, she is the girl who sets the plot and gives the problem children a little joy to their boring lives. Although portrayed as being 200+ years old (is this even true??), she has the personality of a normal girl and that is being easily embarrassed at certain situations and sometimes insecure about the events going around her. However, there is one thing that is for sure. She wants to overthrow the Demon Lords from her world who have been causing nothing more than trouble. \\n\\n\r\nThe series adapts many supernatural and fantasy themes through its setting. In fact, the world that the problem children ventures into is nothing like the world they once knew. There are mystical creatures like dragons, jack-o-lanterns, vampires, and everything we don't see in our modern day world. Despite the dangers some of the creatures pose, the problem children deals with them like another day in the park. In fact, I can safely say that their abilities are far too overpowered with some of them literally getting back up after being battered, shattered, and broken. Izayoi's \u201cCode: Unknown\u201d along with his psychic powers makes him one of the strongest characters in the series. Because of his confidence and strength being nearly unrivaled, no wonder he is often so bored with his life. Asuka's power to control others through words is also seen as a very dangerous and useful ability that extents to animals, humans, and even other gifts. Last, we have the shy girl Kasukabe who rules over the animal kingdom with her skill to communicate and gain their abilities. If you put the three together, it seems to almost like a dream team. However, this is not always the case as the group seems to have problems and ideologies between themselves.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many adversaries in the series ranging from vampire lords to aristocratic individuals who claims themselves as Gods. They set the premise of this series as being the ones causing the trouble and it's up to the problem children to stop them. Yet, there are many instances in which the show takes the wrong turn and make their encounter seem too eccentric. However at other cases, I find the politics and rivalries to be entertaining; more often times with Izayoi because of his personality and speeches.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the series seems original, it does have a few issues. Personally, I found some of the jokes to be a bit too repetitive. This is especially true to our beloved little bunny-eared girl where she becomes the center of attention to lewd jokes. Although amusing to watch at occasions, it becomes old and repetitive. Additionally, the theme of traveling to another world to fight in competitions is not new. Series like Dog Days and Ixion Saga DT have taken such themes before and also performed similar stances. It's been done. The series' pilot episode also seems to be quite rushed with a lot of information thrown in at once rather than expanding them further. I guess this can be related to the issue with the length of the series. It's only 10 episodes so pushing it throughout each episode might of just been too much. Regardless these flaws though, it still makes its exciting point across.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, the series sets itself with the fantasy themes. The Little Garden, the way Kurosaki is dressed, and the mystical creatures are all proof of this. Additionally, the various games themselves revolves around events that are magical. However, I do admit that the characters' designs are a bit too generic. For example, Kurosaki fits into the role of the typical bunny girl with her outfit. The rest of the world where most of the events take place have that fantasy feeling.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the soundtrack, the series makes excellent use of its scores. The soundtrack works well in general and often or not, it's fun to hear it balance out between exciting moments (the game competitions) and some of the more lighthearted times. The OP song, \"Black \u2020 White\" by Iori Nomizu, is very catchy with the way it presents itself with words like \u201cbam!\u201d, \u201c1, 2, 3\u201d, \u201cblack, white\u201d, and other fun words being used. The ED song  \u201cTo Be Continued?\" by Kaori Sadohara gives the main characters a super flat deformed version of themselves and presents into in a fun way. (I'm looking at you Izayoi). It's pure fun to watch it to be honest. Do not skip that ED song.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is the golden egg for me in 2013 so far. Well, at least it's amusing and strange enough with its small cast of badass characters. Oh sure there is some fan service and dirty jokes here and there, but it overall maintains its themes well with the initial premise. In fact, most of the episodes sets with its intense atmosphere related to the games with the main characters each getting his or her own spotlights. And oh, how can we forget that badass Izayoi? The guy has both brains and the brawn that exists entirely opposite of the typical, wimpy, and indecisive male of a harem. So yes, this series was a surprise watch for me. It's only 10 episodes so why not give it a try?",

            "content": "I felt compelled to write a review for this anime so as to balance out any other reviews which might entice people to give this one a go.\r\nMy initial thoughts to this anime was that it was interesting, engaging and entertaining.  The initial premise of the series seemed interesting enough for me to continue watching it.  The animation itself is really well done for the most part, so I thought, hey, give it a go.\r\nAnd I'd say the first episode is engaging and humorous enough to make you watch a second.  But after, that's where it dropped.\r\nLet me explain:\r\nThe first thing isthe complete lack of explanation of the world in which the three gifted human protagonists find themselves in.  Although the three characters are likeable enough, I found myself very confused as to what the actual plot was about.  The bare bones I understood, but basically this was like a mmorpg set in Wonderland with a ditzy ecchi bunny as a tour guide.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially there are communities that have to fight, or play \"gift games\" (yeah, what the hell does that mean?) in order to win gifts for the community, so the community can prosper and move up in the \"world\".\\n\\n\r\nEach \"gift game\" has certain rules - that usually don't make any sense to the watcher -  that the \"players\" have to abide by.  But essentially the \"rules\" mean squat, the protagonists just have to beat up their opponents.  At first I thought the \"gift games\" would be interesting where the \"players\" would have to use their wit or skill to traverse and win, but the \"rules\" or mostly nonsensical, nonexistent, or completely superfluous to the outcome anyway, making the crux of all conflict in the world difficult to swallow.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists themselves have superhuman powers which the show doesn't explain at any point.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is the ecchi.  Okay, so maybe people like fanservice.  Hell, why would the animators do it otherwise?  But there is a level of, yeah okay I'm willing to overlook that, and then there is a point where I say it becomes distracting and pointless.  The constant sexual innuendo of the bunny is tiresome, and I found I couldn't think of a way to sit through the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd after 9 episodes I found the plot, or lack thereof, not deep enough, believable enough, or sustaining enough for me to want to continue.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like a very light-hearted and simple anime with a decent amount of mostly harmless but constant fanservice, I'd go for this one.  If you don't mind being confused about the story, or befuddled as to why the story is so lacking, then give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 4",

            "content": "\"I'm bored. I'm so bored. If i could sell my boredom, i'm sure i could make a living.\" -Izayoi\r\nEver dreamed of being the most powerful human on earth? The ability of giving absolute orders to others, or maybe be able to interact with animals? I'm sure you all have. But, despite having these great powers, three teenagers (or we could say problem children) from different worlds and timelines felt bored. That is until someday they got a once in a lifetime chance to abandon their worlds and live in a dangerous, strange, yet fun and interesting world called \"little garden\" instead. \r\nStory\r\nMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai karaKuru Sou Desu yo? follows the story of three problem children with psychic powers -and a rabbit- in a strange world called Little Garden, a world in which you must win the so called 'gift games' to achieve higher reputation or authority of your 'community'. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is served in a rather fast paced way, so fast that even yourself might not catch up. Even so, it was never boring. There's always something new and unexpected every episode. Several myth such as gods from greek mythology, mystical creatures, magical spirits are presented in the story, eventhough they were modified a bit. Well, maybe a little more than a bit. The Jokes aren't something that could be forgotten. Personally, it got me laughing everytime and i just can't see it coming. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter progression is something that is quite lacking in this anime. They're too overpowered from the start of the first episode to have a decent progression. But who cares when you could enjoy watching teens fighting gods and demons -and winning- with a little to no effort at all. You might see a bit of some developing interaction between the characters, but don't expect too much from it tough.\\n\\n\r\nGraphics are quite stunning. Characters and backgrounds are drawn nicely. The colors are put beautifully. Animation seems wonderful too. Simply put, artwork and animation exceeded so well. It went all up my to my expectations, no, even higher. Such beautiful art is what present animes needs to have. \\n\\n\r\nGiven all that, sounds are nothing exceptional. The soundtrack of this anime (the OP and ED) are originally made for the anime, and we could say that they did quite a pretty good job. I'm not going to go too deep on the sounds, but i could say it really makes the mood. I kept singing it for while after watching it (which i rarely do). But i think what matters the most is music tastes. I don't know what you guys think so the judgement is all yours.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words\\n\\n\r\n10 episodes may not seem as much, but those 10 episodes that i watched really got me on a string. I enjoyed all those 24x10 minutes very much. I didn't regret those times i spent on watching at all. I even rewatched it. Why? Because, umm ,you know, ITS SO AWESOME. I hereby highly recommend this anime for everyone looking for a good time to waste on their screens. Trust me. Have faith in my words. \\n\\n\r\nScore\\n\\n\r\nStory = 8\\n\r\nArt = 9\\n\r\nSound = 8\\n\r\nCharacter = 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 9\\n\r\nOverall = 9\\n\\n\r\nNote By\\n\\n\r\nEnding was left open, so lets all hope season 2 will come out soon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Every Friday I start my day off hoping this anime is subbed by the time I wake up.  \r\nStory:(9)it's original, fun and new elements can be added in each episode.  There are some parts that I would like to go in further detail but that just knit picking. \r\nArt-(9)The art is clean with nice visuals and good actions scenes.  Though I don't care for the visuals too much so I can't go in further detail. \r\nSounds-(9)The voice actors are all great.  The songseven remind me of is this a zombie?(which is great)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-(8)Now the 2 characters I love are black rabbit and Izayoi.  Black rabbit reminding me of hemeji from Baka and test.  While Izayoi is a strong character who seems to have it all.  Without going into to too much detail those two are defentitly refreshing from the weak willed characters.  My only problem is that Asuka and You do not have the same impact but that might change later since I am only 4 episodes in.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-(10)When I watch this anime time just seems to fly by.  I don't even realize the end of the episode until the ending song begins.  Some animes I watch, I always end up looking how much time is left. This anime always leaves me wanting more, which is all I can ask for in watching an anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-(10)My overall is heavily based on enjoyment, which is the most important element  in my opinion. It has a little bit of everything from action,fantasy,romance and originality. Hopefully this anime doesn't let me down and make me eat my words.\\n",

            "content": "Anime is a way for many of us to escape from our boring realities, and immerse ourselves into the worlds quite unlike our own.\r\nWhy did I start with such a cliche and cheesy statement on a review? Is this starting to sound like an essay? \r\nWell, to be fair, Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo (Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They) caters towards the type of individual described above. Individuals seeking to escape reality and adventure into a world of the unknown.\r\nToo bad the world in this anime stays 'unknown'.\r\nThere are many anime that take on the storyboard of'traveling to a different dimension'. Its a born and bred technique that, with minimal uncertainty, will definitely succeed to draw in the common anime watcher. Anime like Log Horizon, SAO, and No Game No Life first come into mind. However, with all my pride of an anime watcher at stake (if I have any), I will say that there is enjoyment in seeing this style of anime does entertain me to a certain extent. The creativity of the setting astounds us, and the ideas hidden within the protagonist's strengths evokes our imagination.\\n\\n\r\n'Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?' follows three characters with the extraordinary powers. The Strongest human, the ability to interact with animals, and the voice of absolute command are all, 'coincidentally', powers that immediately pop into the mind when speaking of supernatural powers that everyone wants.\\n\r\nThese three characters somehow are summoned into the dangerous world of 'Little Garden'\\n\\n\r\nHardly dangerous. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the anime was very fast in introducing the power of our superhuman Izayoi, who defeats a water 'god' in the span of 2 episodes. its a common event that we see in some anime like this. Antagonist underestimates protagonist at hand greatly, protagonist demolishes them with an unexplained skill, and the antagonist regretfully admits his/ her mistake. Of course, on paper it sounds cliche and cheesy, but fans love the moment when the antagonist is overwhelmed due to their sheer incompetence in fighting. Come on Water God, don't challenge our shounen protagonist with only your puny god fighting skills.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is hardly to blame for this. We see it regularly. Sora and Shiro from No Game No Life easily dispatch their humanity hating enemies. Don't get me started on Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. In fact, this anime does well to show that brute force doesn't always win battles compared to the others. Strategy actually appears, albeit occasionally, in the anime. When it does, its hard to watch, as the enemies are so remarkably stupid it makes the strategy in place look well thought out.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the anime did well in though, was introducing the setting and story. The back-story is developed fairly well, and the majority of the plot-holes in the history that appear are subsequently covered with a brief explanation. Our protagonists discover the dilemma of the community of 'No Name'. This community was at the bottom of the food chain in the world of Little Garden.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the story does not go in depth however, is the setting itself. Remember when I said the world stays unknown? The beautiful, imaginative idea of Little Garden is hardly developed. Its a flaw in the style of anime. Make the anime short and risk under developing the setting. Make the anime long to delve into the world and lose action and fast-paced storytelling along with it. Its a problem that is hard to correct. \\n\\n\r\nFor a anime that deeply involves its characters into the plot-line, Character development is a missing piece to the puzzle. A short 10 episodes may attribute to the lack of development, but the reality is, the characters have no where to go! The moment the land on Little Garden, our protagonists are as overpowered as Goku is by the end of Dragon Ball Z. There is a bit of marginal growth for our characters power wise, of course with the exception of Superhuman Izayoi, who is so perfect in the power category that its hard not to become worse.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes I go quite overboard with my little jabs at anime. The artwork in Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? is beautifully done. Characters have no glaring differences in artwork from one point of the anime to the next. The backgrounds are populated with significant detail. Every character looks unique in their own way, and are very distinguishable through artwork.\\n\\n\r\nThrough there is far little in character development, the personalities of our protagonists are actually very unique and fairly intriguing. Each character has a unique personality that quite often suits their abilities and appearance. Because of this, when these characters initiate their abilities, it actually feels as if the the abilities they possess are unique to them only.\\n\\n\r\n                                       ...\\n\\n\r\nWhen individuals rate an anime, they rate it either through their enjoyment or how well the anime is made. Of course, both these two factors influence one and another, but they are also distinctly separate. Someone can watch a plot-hole filled, disturbing, unimaginative anime and still receive enjoyment because it may fulfill with what that individual may want. Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? has some glaring mistakes that all anime of its type possesses, but I cannot say that it didn't have its good points, and that I didn't enjoy it. Many of its problems revolve around the shortness of the anime, along with the cliffhanger ending. However, there is more to come, and when that time comes, there will be individuals to either praise it, or judge it no matter what the outcome. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 - Good\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Please don't think that 6 is bad, for those of you, because I base my ratings off of the word descriptions (ie good, very good, mediocre) rather than the number)\\n\\n",

            "content": "UPDATED 3/15/13 FOR FINAL EPISODE\r\nIt may not be the case for you, but I've had trouble finding some decent anime to watch. I went over maybe 10 animes so far, dropping each one until I finally decided it was time to watch this one. This anime surprised me beyond my wildest expectations. When I read the plot synopsis, I thought it sounded a bit cliche. However, this is far from true. The anime brings to the table amazing characters, a gripping plot, and hours of enjoyment to come. \r\nStory 10/10: This story takes some elements of Dog Days and turns it into a more shonenesque anime. Essentially, its like a more grown-up version of it, with actual fighting instead of just doing obstacle courses. The plot is a bit cliche, with the whole reclaiming honor thing, but the character's emotions and feelings really keep the plot interesting. I feel that at any moment, a small twist could potentially turn the entire anime upside-down and make it into something spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: 10/10 Ok, the anime took an amazing turn toward the end, and really had me hooked in right up until the beginning of the ED. I loved how the story ended up as, and I hope many of you guys think so as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: There are some parts in the anime where it's amazingly well detailed, and some parts where I wish there was more to absorb and look at. My favorite scenes are when the two main girls (You and Asuka) are together in some sort of comedic scene (episode 2 especially (we regret nothing)).\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: 10/10 There's an amazing scene in the last episode (no spoilers) that made me want to pause the video and look at everything. Honestly, I feel like the artistry in this one episode alone is enough to bring it up to a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound  8/10: One thing I have to say is that the OP for this anime is simply amazing. The music is easily one of the most catchy I've ever heard, and I often spend time listening to it on loop while doing homework. However, during some parts of the anime itself, there's this one sax solo bit that doesn't fit well with what's going on in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: 8/10 The last ED (which isn't really an ED, but still) fell a little short imo. However, it doesn't change the score much imo.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Here the anime really shines. All the characters have their own problems (Izayoi not so much) that drives them together to help Black Rabbit retrieve her banner and their community's name. Overall, the characters' personalities are the main selling point of the anime imo. \\n\\n\r\nUPDATE 9/10 A lot of the characters I feel didn't get enough screen time (cough cough You cough cough), and thus weren't able to get an in-depth analysis as it were. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: From enjoying Izayoi's badassery to Black Rabbit's fanservice (light, but there nevertheless), the anime hooks me in from the moment it starts up until the op (which I skip, aint nobody got time for dat (but it is actually pretty good)) and from there until the ed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: Really enjoy this anime, and if it weren't for a few small problems, I would give it 10/10. To anyone who enjoyed stuff like Kaze no Stigma, or likes the idea of a male lead who's a total badass, I would recommend this.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: 10/10 Simply amazing, I'd recommend this to any fan of anime, just because of the amazing story, characters, and enjoyment. :3",

            "content": "First time writing a review but I've wanted to give it a go for a while now.\r\nAnyways!\r\nFor me this was one of those anime that gets you so engaged that at the end of each episode you are like \"god dammit not another week!\"\r\nWell it was like that for me.\r\nFirst let's talk about the story, not going into this too deeply the story is about three kids from different backgrounds who have a gift and are sort of bored with their lifestyle until a letter appears transporting them to this brand new world.\r\nThe series revolves around gift games. These are pre-arranged battles with specific rules.In such games I suppose one could say a wager is placed. I want to explain this more but I really don't want to spoil anything! So just watch ha.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is beautiful. I can't say much more about this. So much \"aww factor\" The ending is cute!\\n\\n\r\nSound, well the voices are beautiful fitting the characteristics of everyone perfectly! and the music is fitting. I love the OP theme so much and the ED theme is cute but not enough to avoid being skipped now and then haha.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Well perfect!\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist is so cool. (like he should be) the female leads are cute. What I liked about this anime is that even though vulnerability was around it wasn't to the point where you had wasted episodes of the characters reflecting on how much they suck and just being a downer. Which in all fairness I understand why it is used in most anime as it gives us something to relate to! but we don't need that in this one!\\n\\n\r\nIt's all about being awesome. Because you know. It is. which brings me to enjoyment I loved this anime. What more can i say? The fight scenes are amazing! So much diversity and not every battle is the same. Each fight had a different purpose and type of opponent and the tactics changed making things so much more interesting! \\n\\n\r\nAnd fan service? Well the problem with a lot of anime is that they rely on just fanservice for their laughs. Which being a guy I get it. (yeah you know what i mean -dirty grin-) but in this anime i wouldn't say it was suttle but it was just not overpowering? If it was removed yes it wouldn't be so funny but the anime would still be great!\\n\\n\r\nSo overall? I gave this a 10/10. The few qualms I have are that the anime is too short! and because of the attitudes of the characters you kind of know how things are going to end but that is made up for with how they are going to get there. But yeah, this has to be the best anime this winter. So much rewatchability, there's a few episodes that I watched an extra time already.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this to anyone whether they be hardcore anime nuts or just casual. There is something here for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading. I hope my first review was good enough. see you again. Maybe. :)",

            "content": "Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? is a very good anime series. It's a kind of Alice in Wonderland mixed with Fairy Tail sort of series. Each of the three main characters have unique abilities and they all fill a nice little niche in this show. I have to say that it is much better than it sounds from the synopsis, and it had me from the first episode. This series is a high 8 in my book, and I highly recommend it.\r\nThe artwork and animation are of course very good. In the last few years animation has really shined with embracing highdefinition, and there is a certain quality that we are getting used to (and in some cases expecting). This series holds that quality and doesn't waver. It has catchy intro music, and the songs throughout each episode fit very nicely into the story. Best of all, the voice acting works really well. This series delivers in the most basic and necessary of areas which gives it a couple of shiny gold stars.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are kind of up and down. I think it was the amount of young children characters that filled the story. It was a bit much at times, but the main and most important of characters were so well done that I could ignore that fact. Everyone had bright and lively personalities, and they were developed very well considering the lack of background stories. In fact, we do get a little of a couple characters backgrounds, but mostly we are left with questions. It's not a major flaw in the design, but it is what brought the series down to an 8 instead of a 9 for me. I wanted to know much much more about the main characters because that was the biggest mystery in this story.\\n\\n\r\nMentioning story, I do have the say that the simple yet entertaining plot was fun to watch. I compared this show to Alice and Wonderland and Fairy Tail for a very big reason. You get your zany magical fighting and action, and then you have your bizarre spiritual world storyline/themes/concept. This is not a ripoff of either, it's actually very different in a lot ways, but it just reminded me so much of those two. The entire point of this story is that these three human kids from different dimensions have to help save this community of \"no-names\" by competing for them in magical games in this sort of fairy tale/spiritual dimension/world. If you love fantasy, that's what you get.\\n\\n\r\nWhere this series goes wrong is in how short it is. I wish it was done in a few more episodes. I wish we had more background of the characters. I wish I would stop saying \"I wish\". Seriously though, it has some flaws, but I really enjoyed it. It has high repeat value, and it has a lot of good things going for it. It is based on a light novel series that I have not read, but I hope there is more to come in a second series/season. If not, then I can whimper and say \"fine\" and maybe deal with the cliffhanger/open ending that we are left with.\\n\\n\r\nAll that aside, this is a must see for fantasy geeks like myself. It's fun and at times a little exciting. It has good humor and much more. Check this short series out.",

            "content": "It's kinda sad that I have to give this show such a low score but it was just very generic... enjoyable non the less, but generic.\r\nFrom the synopsis it already sound generic as heck, 3 teenagers with superpowers go to an alternative reality to fight a demon lord. Well if that isn't something we have never seen before...\r\nStory\r\nThe story makes hardly any sense and I also had a hard time following all the concepts that are thrown at you. That was mostly because of the bad pacing the show had. It felt really rushed (obviously with only 10 episodes) and thus never had time toexplain anything in greater depths.\\n\r\nWhat was that world, how do these gift games work, how does the whole timeline thing work. All these things have to be excepted to enjoy this show, because they get loosely attention, while the story never really focuses on something.\\n\r\nWell besides the whole No-Names and building up their reputation.\\n\r\nOn a good note I can say it was sometimes really funny and because of its length never felt unimportant, the episodes also all were quite enjoyable to watch even though it kinda jumped in time here and there without any sense of progression.\\n\\n\r\n4/10 Decent\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nFrom a realism point of view the characters all felt quite one dimensional and stereotypical, but have shown possible character development. It all hinges upon the number of Episodes and how they tried to tell and show you as much as possible, character had almost no time to establish. But they sure gave all the characters their screentime without focusing on one too much and on the other to little.\\n\r\nMotivations of all characters felt very sketchy though, be it villain or hero. They all just kinda did their stuff.\\n\r\nBut I can say that I still greatly enjoyed them. Izayoi was pure gold being a bad ass superhuman he was, was fresh and entertaining. The girls where all likable and gave you some fanservice points if you are looking for that, at least each girl was for some sort of fetish available.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 Fair\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nStudio Diomedea who animated this show didn't really do anything outstanding.\\n\r\nActionscenes were mostly cut and static, or did use pan shots to save work/money. Overall the quality was rather generic as well as the artstyle.\\n\r\nI did like the character designs. They kinda reminded me (in case ofAsuka) of Type Moon. It didn't look bad but also not great. There isn't much to say here to be honest.\\n\\n\r\n5/10 Mediocre\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening was pretty cool and I liked that Iori Nomizu sung both (OP and ED).\\n\r\nI liked her performance in the openings of Kore wa Zombie desu ka? a lot, this song wasn't as great as the catchy rocksongs in Kore wa Zombie desu ka?.\\n\r\nThe Ending was kinda meh... didn't like it.\\n\r\nThough both fit the show, energetic, kinda cute.\\n\r\nAs already mentioned Iori Nomizu voiced Kurousagi and I just like her.\\n\r\nThe other VAs did a good job as usual in most anime nowadays. Nothing stood out besides Satomi Arai which has one of the most unique voices in the buisiness. She is known from the Raildex shows as Kuroko and I just love her quirky voice.\\n\r\nFunny thing to mention as a side note, in this show she also plays the roll of a lesbian pervert DFC loli...\\n\r\nThe OST is forgettable and not mentionable.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nValue and Enjoyment\\n\r\nI fused both to one together because they are kinda similar.\\n\r\nI think I will not re watch it or some episodes, but I sure would watch a second season if one comes out.\\n\r\nOn a sentimental level it had no big impact. I don't wanna keep it, or will remember it for a great anime I've seen. It was enjoyable as it lasted but nothing worth while.\\n\r\nOn a historical level there is no arguing that this anime will be forgotten quickly and will have no impact what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the characters, from both an design standpoint and form a personality one. The opening was also okay, but the rest was kinda meh.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime gets a 5/10 which is sad, I think it could have been better. \\n\\n\r\nBut as said in the introduction, it was really enjoyable. If you are looking for some fantasy action show with some cool characters that are a but out of the general stereotypes give it a try.\\n\r\nIf not you are not missing out.\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so the 10 episode anime has recently ended and I like the fact that studio Diomedea has limit it to just 10 episode, so without further adieu, I present my ratings for this anime:\r\nStory & Art: Mediocre 5.\r\nThe story is a typical good versus evil kind of thing which is more likely appropriated for audience who are in a age range of 10 to 15 years old since the main climax was typical of people from another world whom where called upon to help fight in an alternate universe and in this case it revolves around the 3 teenagers from another world with specialabilities called \"Gifts,\" who where invited to join up with the \"No Names\" by a seemly clumsy bunny girl named \"Kurouasagi,\" in order to participate is the so called 'Gift Games.\"  The Art in general was for me...................just the usual though some Kurousagi fanservice would have added some spice in it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI simply just like both opening and closing theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nNow the thing about the characters in this anime, more emphasis was given to  the 3 teenagers which is good, but the let down was Kurousagi, she did invited the 3 teenagers to come to the \"  Miniature Garden\" and participate in the \"Gift Games\" but for her to stand as a regulator of the games while belonging with the \"No Names\"  was a bit odd. I'd probably say that her character to not fight for the 'No Names\" unless there where circumstances that permits her was a total misplacement for her role. Writer  Tar\u014d Tatsunoko\\n\r\n should have considered Jin Russel be in the shoes of Kurousagi, and Kurousagi should have had a separate role one which she has no alliance with anyone except be the game moderator.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the enjoyable part of this anime was action genre combine with fantasy which was based around the 'Pied Piper of Hamlin,\" but generally speaking   it was Izayoi's kickass action that makes up for the enjoyable part of this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime did have a comedy genre, but it was limited to Kurousagi being pissed with the 3 teenagers who are looking for action, thought the title  \"Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\" trasnlates to \"Problem Children are Coming from Another World, Aren't They??\" was a bit of a patsy it was fair enough to be enjoyed. But for this anime to be given higher score for its overall, doesn't really count since studio Diomedea misuses the children's fantasy story \"The Piped Piper of Hamlin\" by giving it a darker side was unnecessary to say the least, as for the anime's title, it is something that should have been use in a genre that has a extreme action where the so called problem children are the main bad guys.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd so my review ends, will this anime have a season 2?????I think studio Diomedea should just limit it to a couple of OVA's.",

Which brings me to the why in the hell is there only 10 episodes of this anime. BLASPHEMY. \r\n-Story-\r\nThe three main characters have these amazing powers and are bored with the regular world. An envelope arrives for each person. They've been summoned by the Black Rabbit to help the community \"No Name\" to overthrow the Devil King.\r\nWhat I absolutely love about this series is how they incorporate mythical stories and what notinto the anime. I haven't seen something this good along those lines since Campione! \\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nThe art is incredible and the characters are drawn so very well. Every character has their own unique charisma about them. Everything is colorful, the girls are cute. This is the first time I think I fell in love with a furry.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nIt's sound. The ending and opening themes are okay. Nothing extraordinary about this series. The cast is very awesome though. The way Kurousagi answers Yes in English is very cute.\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\nThis brings the best out of the show. Due to the nature of the show every character good or bad is unique. because of the mythology incorporated into the show, this highlights how well this series is. Izayoi is the strongest badass around. Asuka needs a little more character build up, but she started to shine in later episodes getting a grasp of her powers. You Kasugabe is a unique design with the qualities of animals. Kurousagi (Black Rabbit) is just awesome all together. almost a female version of Izayoi.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nThis series is totally worth every minute and numerous amounts of re watch. It isn't super fan serviced at all. It's just about perfect all around. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\nFun and exciting. I can't believe it is only 10 episodes long. I hope to hear an announcement for a second season soon.",

The story is very good, it's well paced and really well adapted, it's not perfect and not something we haven't seen before but it makes little mistakes and it's solid and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe art style wasn't amazing, and this anime is almost recent so they could have done the animations and background art style even better but it was good overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music was great, the OP is really enjoyable and the ED is really funny, the voice acting was very good and the background sound and music fight was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe development was great for being a 10 episodes anime, they give you what you need to know about them and make them interesting since the beginning and how they get to develope their powers, Izayoi is overpowered and i wanted to know the reason, we don't get to know Izayoi that much but you only ask yourself that at the end, Azuka and Kasukaba were interesting and well developed, more than Izayoi in the sense that we get to know a little more about them than Izayoi, Usagi was a great character, every episode knowing a little bit more about her and is surprising how badass she can be, there were some flaws with support characters and the Main ones but overall was very good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime but i felt it was too short and needed more episodes but that's my thought of wanting more, it was fun to watch this, at first i saw Izayoi a bit like a douche and cocky but at the 2nd episode and from that on he was an overpowered cocky badass, but as i stated it was short so it was a very good enjoyment.",

            "content": "It's easy to say if an anime is a Light Novel adaptation just by how long is the title. Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo don't escape the rule. Only 4 episodes are out, but by seeing how a lot of animes of this winter are boring, it's not an exaggeration to make this one of my favourite. \r\nStory - 7\r\nThe story focused on 3 childs who received a power at birth, named 'gift'. They are sent to another world by Kurosagi (Black 'sexy' Rabbit) to help her with her community.\r\nSince this world turn around a 'gift' competition, the show mix action, fantasyand supernatural. \\n\r\nThe story in itself is good, it has some suspens, and is correctly developped.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nSmooth and clean. Character design is one of my favourite, and backgrounds are nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe opening is amazing, and the ending is funny. The sound don't seem bad during the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nWhile Izayoi is your average clich\u00e9 of overpowered-highschool boy, which I really like, the others don't really shine by themself, apart from Kurosagi who is quite funny and support what you can call a light fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nIt's really interesting to follow this show, since there is some mystery, specially about Izayoi's gift. I'm personaly following this show with impatience and interest, and surely until the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nIt's really easy to give it an 8, since it's pratically the only supernatural and action show this winter, supernatural being my favourite genre.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're going to watch this show, you should have some things in mind. Firstly, there is some 'light' fanservice. It don't really disturb the show, but some are so haters of that, that it might be underlined. Then, it's a Light Novel adaptation, so, to keep the book being saled, it have some lacks in the story and character development. If you saw Sword Art Online, then you can deduce that it will have the same sorts of lacks, as a rushed story for example.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into supernatural, over-powered children and a little of action and fan-service, you should give it a try.",

            "content": "Fantasy, Supernatural, Action, and a little dash of Comedy. Those are just some of the ingredients that make up Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?. A Girl with the \"Geass\" type of gift, A Girl with a wooden necklace that can copy a gift of another, a high school boy that has an unknown gift that could kill gods and destroy the heavens, and lets not forget the bunny girl with huge, um... you get my point.\r\nStory/Plot: 7/10\r\nI'm quite a little bit disappointed in the plot, it has this feel of having the same flow as the anime \"Fairy Tail\". \r\nLet me sitethe plot flow of the two anime:\\n\r\n1.) Problem rises involving their Guild/Community.\\n\r\n2.) Group shows a little worried on the current situation.\\n\r\n3.) Anime shows a little shady background of an unknown character.\\n\r\n4.) An/Most of ally gets Wounded/Captured.\\n\r\n5.) Protagonist defeats the enemy/ wins the gift game.\\n\r\n6.) A new ally is accepted to their Guild/Community.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i'm saying here is that Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? has predictable outcomes so far after viewing the 5 episodes. The male protagonist is obviously  \"Imbalanced\" in a very obvious way of defeating Gods. But hey, the series ain't finished yet, we'll see if this deserves more than 7 in the future.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nJust awesome, Animation is not the \"Moe moe\" type that i love, but it still gives that feel of a satisfying animation. Surroundings are well detailed as well as the characters. And may i just add, this anime has one of the best ED animation EVER! The chibis dancing in a very smooth way just makes me very very happy, and that's the main reason i gave the animation a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSounds here are great, the voices of the characters matches their appearance/mood. Background music was fine, yada yada yada. OP Music is like the Kore wa zombie desu ka OP/ED Music, which i find very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are very good. Although the other one that has the \"unknown\" gift is too much. Overall an 8 is quite enough. Girls that can Copy and Command, a vampire/a former demon lord, a teenage high school boy with a gift that destroys the heavens. But the bunny girl does it all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nDepends on how we define Enjoyment in an anime. Some defines enjoyment as having the feeling of impatience or more specifically, can't wait for a week for the next episode. Some define enjoyment as loving the twists in the plot, and making predictions and being able to discuss it with others.The unique set rules in every gift game made me excited(By finding loopholes in the rules.) and those two definitions about enjoyment made me give the 8 out of 10.Yeah sure, we all think a week is torture for waiting for the next episode, but i find this anime hard to discuss with other people, well mostly because we all have the same ideas on whats going to happen next. Unless this anime will reveal more secrets in the future. Don't forget were only halfway through the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.4/10\\n\\n\r\nEverything is very good, except for the plot that is. A no name community that was destroyed by demon lords. Suddenly three humans with extraordinary gifts is called from their own worlds by a bunny girl(Yey!). Now they plan to revive the community to its former self. Pretty good so far right? But the Hows are my problem...\\n\\n\r\nSo how do they revive the guild? \\n\r\n-They participate in gift games and win!\\n\\n\r\nSo how do they win in gift games? \\n\r\n-By using the girl that can command almost anything.\\n\r\n-By using the girl that can copy the enemy's abilities.\\n\r\n-By using the high school teenage boy that can destroy the heavens and defeat the gods.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nProtagonists are imbalanced, and didn't show any costs on using their powers halfway through the series. Though, it's still a must watch for me, and highly recommended.",

            "content": "What can I say, after finishing this 10 ep anime, I'd say that I find most of it's category as pretty much mediocre. So I'm no longer gonna make any deliberations and I'll just get straight to the point:\r\nMediocre 5.\r\nStory- The story in general was typical of a group of weak members who needs to outsource it's battle by taking in a trio of special kids whom are too bored in the world they live in, which for them to be in such alternate universe like the so called 'Little garden.' and as usual it involves a lotta made up terminologies like the Conejo Negra's( I'm referring to Kurousagi) gift called \"Spear of Indra,\" Izayoi's  \"Code: Unknown,\" Asuka's  \"Oraculum\" and You's \"Genome Arbor - Non Priorum.\" Where them trio ( the conejo negra not inculded)  have to participate in the watchamcallit  \"Gift Game,\" and as usual of a typical fantasy genre it shift's from one plot to a sub plot and to another plot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-  The tres adolescentes which were compose of Izayoi, Asuka and You are not bad in respect to their roles, since they are the problem children that this anime's title was referring to. But to call them problem children was a bit of an overstatement since they don't look like a trio of delinquents rather they're just bored. But the Conejo Negra (I'm referring to Kurousagi)... well, I don't dig as to why she's given that name since only her top blouse and her knee high socks are black- I don't know about her underwear, anyway for a character like her to be given such a name is befitting for an antagonist or to a support character who is protagonist with a dark side  and if I were director, Yasutaka Yamamoto, I would have given her role to Shiroyasha. Also, her role is some what of a double standard that though she is a member of the 'No Names' she is also the overseer of the 'Gift Game' that she cannot fight for her own side unless there are certain breaking of the rules that permit her to do so which is why she should have been in the shoes of  Shiroyasha, and Shiroyasha should be in the Conejo Negra's shoes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Humm, so I may have given this anime's enjoyment a mediocre score, but still it was enjoyable enough to be watched since this anime has an action genre in it where the battle between good and evil is something to look forward to and that's as good as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall, the title \"Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\" really doesn't befit this anime as a whole, but given the action part of this anime, I'd say it was still worth giving it a benefit of a doubt. I do commend studio Diomedea  for just limiting it to 10 ep.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDecent 4.\\n\\n\r\nArt- I can only say that the art was wholesome that there was no fanservice for the pirreos to howl for.\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3.\\n\\n\r\nSound- I hate both opening and closing themes, finish.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAdios amigos.",

            "content": "*This is a review of the original ten episodes and the OVA.\r\nThis was a series that I was really interested in watching, but never really got around to it until the summer of 2014. The title by itself was interesting enough, but after I had read the plot summary and saw that it had received good reviews, I decided to watch this series. I enjoyed watching it so much that I decided to re-watch it last week, and while I didn\u2019t get the same amount of enjoyment from the first time I watched it, Problem Children was still a really fun series to watch.\r\nStory:\r\nProblem ChildrenAre Coming From Another World, Aren\u2019t They (Problem Children)\u2019s story revolves around three humans with extraordinary abilities. These abilities make everyday life extremely boring or unfulfilling for these individuals. That was until, one day, they each received a mysterious letter that said that if they gave up all of their friends, family, and worldly possessions, that they would have an opportunity to test the limits of their powers. They are then transported to the world of Little Garden, a world inhabited by several different types of creatures, and run by a series of supernatural events called \u201cGift Games\u201d. The three humans run into Black Rabbit, the being who summoned them to this newfound world. They quickly discover that Little Garden isn\u2019t just fun and games. Little Garden is the home of several different communities, each having it\u2019s own name, flag, and status in the world. Black Rabbit is a part of the community known as the \u201cNo Names\u201d because all of their status was stolen from them during a Gift Game against a demon lord. She brought these three problem children to Little Garden hoping that they would join the \u201cNo Names\u201d in their quest to recapture their lost status.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I enjoyed Problem Children\u2019s story, it definitely had its flaws. The first issue I have the story is how many things weren\u2019t fully explained or explored. The biggest question I have about the story is about the world of Little Garden itself. You\u2019re not really given much information about Little Garden other than the fact that it exists, and while they do mention something about a \u201cParallel World Intersection Theory\u201d it is never explained. Little Garden also seems to have elements from several different works of literature and religions. It showcases characters and tales from Shinto to the Brothers Grimm, and they never explain how any of this works. Also, Little Garden is massive, it was estimated to be about the size of the sun, and so much of the world isn\u2019t shown or explained to us. They mention that there are several communities and races within the Little Garden, but we don\u2019t get to see a whole lot of them. Which is definitely a shame, because the world itself is extremely interesting and I would\u2019ve loved to learn more about it. The final issue I have with the series involves one the series\u2019 main plot points. That being how exactly did the demon lords forced the now \u201cNo Names\u201d, and others like them, into a gift game where all of their status was on the line. It\u2019s another thing that was never explained in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also doesn\u2019t come to a very satisfying conclusion. While the last episode does wrap up the events of the conflict that was taking place, the journey of the \u201cNo Names\u201d was far from over. The characters had even set goals that they wanted to accomplish earlier in the series, and we never got to see those fulfilled. Overall, even though it was a good ending to the arc they were in, it wasn\u2019t a good ending for the series, so lets hope they decided to make a second season.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the OVA, extra fanservice aside, it just felt like more of the same, which was a good thing. But, it just served as another reminder that the story isn\u2019t over. It\u2019s never specifies whether the events in the OVA take place during or after the events of the first season, but either way it only makes you want more.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t a whole lot to say about the animation other than that it\u2019s good. Everything in the series is animated really well. The character models, background scenery, and fights scenes are all done really well. While there is nothing spectacular here, it is definitely good, quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nProblem Children has a vast and varied soundtrack with songs that can compliment any scene in the series. If the scene is tense and a little creepy, a tense and eerie song will compliment it. If the scene is lighthearted and upbeat, the soundtrack provides us with a lighthearted and upbeat song to compliment this as well. The soundtrack features songs that have a good amount repeatability, and is complimented by a solid opening and incredibly catchy ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis series stars four main characters, the three \u201cProblem Children\u201d You Kasukabe, Asuka Kudou, and Izayoi Sakamaki, and the person who summoned them to Little Garden, Black Rabbit. As mentioned earlier, all the three of the problem children have special abilities that made their lives boring or unfulfilling, which is why they were invited to Little Garden. During the course of the series, you\u2019ll start to understand why each of the characters decided to come to Little Garden, and see them start of growing as characters. Initially, the characters might just seem like incredibly basic and one dimensional characters, but as the series progresses you\u2019ll start seeing that there is more too them. That being said there really isn\u2019t a massive amount of character development, especially for Black Rabbit and Izayoi. Those two characters are also the ones who we get the least amount of background information about.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are likeable and enjoyable to watch. The characters deferent personalities worked well together and made their interaction entertaining to watch. For example, Black Rabbit is easily flustered, and even though the You, Asuka, and Izayoi are taking on the huge responsibility of rebuilding an entire community, they are still problem children. The are constantly doing things that Black Rabbit doesn\u2019t approve of, and that creates some very funny moments during the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a decent amount of side characters in the series. For the most part, they are all given a decent amount of screen time, and at least a little background information.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren\u2019t They?. The story was interesting, the animation and sound were really well done, and the characters were very likeable and enjoyable to watch. I\u2019m really hoping for a second season so that I can see how the story ends.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict and Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3.6/5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4.3/5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3.7/5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4.1/5\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 3.9/5\\n\\n\r\nProblem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren\u2019t They? is a very good series that will keep you entertained from beginning to end.",

            "content": "\"I'm bored, really bored. If I could sell my boredom, I'm confident I could make a living.\" -- Izayoi Sakamaki\r\nThere were some moments in this anime where I thought exactly this. Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? or the English name for it Problem Children are coming from another world, aren\u2019t they? (addressed to as Mondaiji in this review) is an action anime and is very proud of being one \u2013 the anime has action flowing from its ears! Now by excluding things like plot and character development, Mondaiji has done two things which are very noticeable:\t\r\n1.\tLimit your audience.\r\n2.\tMinimize the critique which canbe thrown at you.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot centers on 3 main protagonists, namely: \\n\r\n-\tIzayoi Sakamaki\\n\r\n-\tAsuka Kudou\\n\r\n-\tYou Kasukabe\\n\\n\r\nThe first of the three: Izayoi Sakamaki is a very arrogant and cocky boy. He will do anything to get his dose of entertainment. The second is Asuka Kudou, the archetype rich girl would fit her very much, and she seems to be able to do things with her own two hands. So I wouldn\u2019t say she is that much of a clich\u00e9. Lastly, You Kasukabe, the quiet girl of the trio. If you have seen more than a dozen of anime, she should strike you as similar. Now these three get an envelope and they are magically teleported to a place called Little Garden. They are to entertain themselves with Gift games here and to join a guild. These Gift Games can be about anything and for anything. They can help the guild you join grow, or for personal pleasure. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, they are roaming free in a MMORPG world. \\n\\n\r\nIf you paid attention to that last line, it will sound very familiar. Indeed, they have also jumped the bandwagon of incorporating MMORPG features in their anime, the 2 before them are Sword Art Online and Accel World and have done similar things. But everyone has their own perception and ideas; you can do a lot of things with the gaming theme. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I found a rather good move on the author\u2019s part was to really target a selected audience and stick with it. The fact that the main characters have no flaws, the story is not deep whatsoever and that it has a gaming theme. With these facts you can easily pick out the audience the author was trying to reach with his writing: the gamer audience who like short, sweet and action-packed anime (and might not have too large of an attention span). With this move you won\u2019t entertain the watcher who comes across this and tries it on a whim, so I would say this anime has its fair share of dislikes due to the small audience it targets.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the plot: Non-existent. Yes, unfortunately this anime doesn\u2019t have much of a plot. It has one, but it is put on a sidetrack. The main characters try to revive a guild that was destroyed by an evil demon lord (which we do not see in the series). Now that is its plot, what do they focus on? Fanservice, fighting things for no good reason and generally lure you towards watching it with pretty visual and before mentioned fights. Now, with a series that lasts 10 episodes (10 x 24 minutes), you wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on both the plot and actually fighting without moving the story slower than a snail\u2019s dead born hatchling. So now you might be wondering, does this show only deliver fights? Yes, and with quantity.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights which sometimes are with reason and sometimes not, are phenomenal eye-candy and most likely the only reason you would like this show. Now the so called \u201cgifts\u201d of this show are pretty much psychic powers, the show does a very bad job at explaining what gifts can include and what kind of gifts exist. \\n\r\nBecause the show does not clarify this, the fights the show produces are sometimes somewhat hard to follow. The main thing which irked me about this is that the main male protagonist is a mystery. He just seems to have high physical abilities. Keeping a lot of things shrouded on the action which is their main attraction is a very bad move.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing which caught my attention is the fact that they go out of their way to include a lot of stuff (the fact that elves, dwarves etc exist), but they never do anything with this setting. All the characters have a human form and the whole concept is forgotten about, except for the small fairy which appears the last two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nNow on to some positive qualities this show possesses. Not that I enjoy this myself, but the fanservice was done in a way it didn\u2019t become annoying. The girl characters didn\u2019t become tools for the fanservice moments which happened each 3 minutes. Although there was the occasional lewd moment, it was done subtle and I probably could count all the moments on 1 hand. So hats off to them for making it a bearable experience for the female watcher.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that this is only 10 episodes also has its positive effects. Since you spend a measly 240 minutes on this show, it isn\u2019t that big of a time investment. So even if you disliked it, you wouldn\u2019t have wasted that much of your precious, precious time. The fact that it had created such a big world with so many possibilities could mean that they can obtain a return in a year or so, depending on BD sales and other merchandise. If they were to get another season, they would have plenty of potential material. \\n\\n\r\nHow it breaks away from other action anime is quite the pleasant surprise as well. Most anime around that genre with the demographic shounen attached to it are about the main protagonists overcoming hardships. The antagonists for each arc are consequently beaten to a pulp without too much effort. This one is quite different, the characters are already on that level, and they have nothing to overcome. So I guess you are in for a surprise when you watch this anime regardless of what you expect or do not expect. Now from what I gather on ratings and personal opinions, a lot of people liked the completely overpowered main character who wipes the floor with each adversary he comes across. Personally, I like my characters to have a taste of defeat, but again, this way it complements the fact that the series is only 10 episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the animated part of the series, this includes how the characters are drawn. This is my main point of critique on this section as well. I found the characters models to be very bland. And why in god\u2019s name is Izayoi wearing those headphones - is he listening to music 24/7 or something? Now on to more relevant stuff... The animation was absolutely amazing in this show; you would expect that when it comes to fast moving characters and projectiles the show would make them a tad static. Although there is a hint of it here and there, the actually animated parts are done nicely. So that is a plus which I would like to give it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that concludes our animation section, as I do not know enough of studios to compare this work to other stuff they did.\\n\\n\r\nNow the sound, we can separate this into:\\n\r\n-\tSoundtrack\\n\r\n-\tOps/Eds\\n\r\n-\tVoice actors\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was done up to a good standard. They had some fast paced music in there when the characters were fighting and slightly, more relaxed music as they were having a conversation. The opening and ending were pretty good. Now my main taste is definitely not in J-POP, but I kind of liked these ones. As for the voice actors, they did a fair enough job I\u2019d say. The main male who has a very arrogant and cocky attitude was done well by his respective voice actor. I think the rest of the cast has done a quite good job as well. \\n\\n\r\nWe have arrived at the character section now. There isn\u2019t a lot left for me to say. We will start with the English title; Problem Children are coming from another world, aren\u2019t they? Because problem children are what they are, they constantly try to entertain themselves, at the cost of other characters, whether it is the supporting cast or the antagonists. I talked about archetypes in the beginning of this review, the princess one/tsundere and the silent girl/kuudere one. Although there is hardly romance in this anime, so the tsundere and kuudere are not really necessary, we could view these girls as such. I think the writer has done quite well to break away from the clich\u00e9; both are not annoying within their role. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing which I found mediocre on this show was the motivation, especially when they are interacting with each other. \u201cIt will be fun.\u201d This seems to be the sole motivation for each character \u2013 and to be honest, this is a bit on the weak side.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let us move to the conclusion. So overall I thought Mondaiji was a weak anime, as it did not have a concrete plot or any apparent character development. Although these words might seem harsh, I did in fact enjoy Mondaiji. The action in it was sublime and I was as excited as any jolly teenager would be seeing this. I give it 5 out of 10! \\n",

I was bored \r\n 2. It had a dog days recommendation.\r\nBut I was outstandingly surprised with what was presented, and I enjoyed this thoroughly and with a light heart.\r\nThe Story: 8: This must have been modelled around dog days, people coming from an other world to participate in events and games (believe it or not, but war is a game in Dog Days.... whoknew...) and to bring strength back to a community that is in a tough spot. Really enjoyed it =D\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9: Very colourful and happy, with even the nights being light up with a shower of oranges, reds, yellows and other bright colours. It is a very light-hearted art style that was a very refreshing splash from usual\\n\\n\r\nBut like all good thing this anime had its moments that were obviously made for the younger audiences with little or no over-the-top kind of fights or battles (wired, considering they are trying to defeat a demon...) that sort of makes fights seem less serious than they are\\n\\n\r\nIn short is was very entertaining and enjoyable to watch, I loved it, and anybody who loves a good comedy and funny main, I suggest you watch this now!  \\n",

            "content": "Have you ever wished life was one big game? Who am I kidding, we probably all have. For whatever reason, we wish life would lose at least some of its boredom. Maybe you find school to be naught but a chore. Maybe your job is tedious and your boss is a dick. For whatever reason, you find yourself trudging through life, unable to enjoy anything. Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? Is an anime that explores what it would be like if the world were decided through games. Games of all sorts and varieties. You set up the rules, place your stakes, andplay. Oooohhh, how I wish. They say that if you find a job you love, you'll never work a day in your life, and I feel this anime is one of the shining examples of that belief. \\n\r\nI say that everything is decided through games, but that may be a bit misleading. Sure, there are a good number of literal games one can play. You want to challenge someone to pick a specific card from a deck, by all means, place your bets. But, if you want a contest of strength, where the victor is the one left alive, that's ok too. Everything in this world goes, you just have to establish the rules beforehand. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nI'm going to be quite honest, I loved this story. But a bit of clarification in saying that- The idea of people getting transported to a foreign world to assist some underdogs in some sort of conflict is nothing new. But thanks to MAL's scoring system, I throw both the premise and the world under the category of story. This world was one that I found entirely original, and that's pretty rare these days. As you likely gathered from my preface, this is a world where everything is decided through games, \u201cGift Games\u201d to be exact. The games have predetermined rules that cannot be broken, but they do not have to be completely clear for both parties involved. The games even have overseers to ensure the rules are followed. The gift aspect of that title arises from the tools participants utilize in the games. These gifts have a wide variety of possibilities, ranging from a super-power to a magic item. Did I mention that by the way? There is magic in this world. Rather, it is more accurate to say the world is magic. \\n\r\nThe world is named Little Garden. I don't know who chose this name, as it is pretty bloody far from the truth. The world is said to be roughly the size of the sun, which means it is roughly 100 times larger than the Earth's surface. Whoever decided to throw the adjective little into the name of that world certainly has an odd sense of humor. Many of the denizens of Little Garden are members of a community as it is recommended to be in one if you are to participate in a Gift Games. The communities are as they sound, a community of people. But I found that they were very comparable to a guild, like one may find in an MMO or watching Fairy Tail. A group of people who come together under a single banner to live on the same land, work together, be a team, be family, etc, etc. The specifics would vary depending upon the individual community. \\n\r\nWhat I really liked about this world was the lack of a happy go lucky vibe. This world wasn't perfect, there existed slavery, kidnapping, blackmail, poverty, and death was a realistic consequence. It added an extra degree of immersion knowing that though they are called games, that was really just an illusionary pleasantry. These were high stakes contests with realistic consequences. \\n\r\nWith all of my praises, you may be wondering why it is only rated as an 8. The answer is due to the simple fact that so much of this world and its nuances remain unexplored. I have questions left about the specifics of this world, the Demon Lords and their powers, the No-Names that the story focuses on. We just aren't given enough information. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe animation was very solid on the whole. The action scenes seemed fluid, I loved the scenery, a wide array of vibrant colors. I also was a big fan of the character designs, they were all memorable and an aspect I was a big fan of. \\n\r\nI am also going to mention the ending theme in this section. Sure, \"To Be Continued?\" by Kaori Sadohara was a catchy little song, but the real reason I watched it so many times was the chibi art-style of the main characters dancing. It was just so much fun to watch, it never failed to bring a very large grin to my face. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \\n\r\nThere isn't a ton I can say. The OST was solid on the whole, but none of the tracks jumped out at me as being spectacular. \\n\r\nThe voice acting was pretty damn good. I have only seen the show subbed, so I cannot make any comments on the quality and/or accuracy of the dub, but the sub felt almost perfect. There wasn't a single voice I didn't find fitting, and to the opposite effect, I liked every single one. \\n\r\nThe OP was awesome. \"Black \u2020 White\" by Iori Nomizu was a very good song that quickly found its way into my musical library. The visuals were pretty good as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nI don't know why, but many anime throughout the years have habits of making the main characters fairly weak characters (in terms of their capabilities). Whether or not they remain weak is irrelevant, but weak characters are a very common trope. Maybe people just love the underdog story, maybe it is so the weak and timid viewer base can insert themselves into a given situation with relative ease. Whatever the reason, thank you for the breath of fresh air Tar\u014d Tatsunoko (the author of the original light novels, I just looked it up). These characters are immediately established as being skilled. But having skill alone is not the recipe for a good character, I can point out a dozen gary stus that suck as characters. These characters all have their own bit of charm, and it makes them an extremely fun and memorable cast because of that. \\n\\n\r\nIzayoi Sakamaki- Here we the ultimate badass of this show. This guy has confidence and cockiness seeping from every pore in his body. Is that imagery a bit weird? Sorry for that, but it's accurate. He is an extremely capable fighter and he is quickly established as being intelligent as well. I'll be honest, he is a bit OP, but don't let that deter from thinking he is a good character. He isn't a perfect nice guy, he isn't the type to get involved in every one of his friends' problems. He is a bit of a pervert, but not the over-the-top get a nosebleed kind, but a confident one who will compliment a girl and give a descriptive run down of her outfit and how it perfectly accentuates her curves. This guy honestly is just a pleasure to watch. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Rabbit- The bunny girl who serves as the primary source of fan-service for your viewing pleasure. Ok, there is a bit more to her than that. She is a girl who brings the problem children into her community, and in a sense serves as their caretaker. Rather, that is what she is supposed to do. Quite frankly, she is outclassed. She tries to be oh so serious, but thanks to the eccentricities of the other characters, she often ends up in a flustered state. She is not incompetent, but she doesn't seem to shine as brightly as the problem children... * wink * \\n\\n\r\nAsuka Kudou- She is the rich girl character. She immediately displays this high class, haughty, arrogance that could only come from someone born into power and money. That is just her initial appearance however, and you see she is actually a fairly kind girl who is also highly intelligent and perceptive. Of the main cast, she receives the most (and best) development. \\n\\n\r\nYou Kasukabe- Here we have the fairly quiet girl. Note, she is not a Rei Ayanami or Yuki Nagato, just a fairly quiet girl. I draw the distinction because I don't often see characters like her. She isn't shy or socially awkward, just quiet. But usually quiet characters are taken to the very extreme, but she strikes a nice balance. She is a nice girl with a good heart. Oh, and she can speak to animals. \\n\\n\r\nGranted, Asuka is the only character who benefits from any real degree of development. But despite that I still give these characters a score of 8 because they felt so individualistic and memorable. It is also their capabilities. Izayoi is most definitely the powerhouse of the show, but the other characters always have a role to play. Correction, it is a pivotal role that they play. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nI use anime as a form of escapism, and this anime fulfills that to a tee. Magic, fighting, and all in game-like format. The characters were awesome, and their early escapades across this world created fun and exciting situations with a unique flare I have not seen demonstrated elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nIt's a high 8, but not quite deserving of a 9. This was an amazing world and concept with a very fun cast of characters. Its greatest downfall is ultimately the fact that it only received 10 episodes. The show thankfully didn't try and cram too much into this less than one cour time-frame, but it leaves a TON to be desired. \\n\r\nThe show is short enough that it feels just like a long movie, so it isn't even a massive time sink. This anime is most definitely worth a watch. Even if you don't latch onto the world or characters as much as I do, the whole show is just a big ball of fun.",

            "content": "Tired of all your beta main characters? Well Mondaiji-tachi is one of those anime that has an awesome main character. It isn't like your typical fantasy adventure anime, but an action packed anime with good comedy. Prepare to join the world of 'Little Garden'.\r\nIzayoi Sakamaki may be one of the bad ass character I've seen. He isn't as beta as Ichika Orimura from Infinite Stratos. Before I go down explaining the characters, there are two type of main characters; alpha and beta. Alpha main characters would be one of the main character that viewers would like and would be a dominant person rather than backingoff in certain situations. Beta main characters are characters that are indecisive and doesn't know how to handle an event. The current anime trend tend to have beta main character as some may see them cute. Now Izayoi is one fine gentlemen that was able to deal with many situations which makes me enjoy the anime. It wasn't rage inducing because I didn't feel disappointed in his decision makings. The only anime that I can see has somebody that is similar to Izayoi is Kaze No Stigma. The other characters like Kurousagi, You Kasukabe and Asuka Kudou are very unique. Having the anime explain the backstory of where these children came from made me feel that I was able to connect with the characters. It is significant because they're all from different timelines and each one have their own problems. Thus, it makes the title: Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They?\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was great. I was able to enjoy it because of the action. It may be cliche, but it followed the light novel. It was sad that the anime only became a 10 episode anime. There are more materials in the light novel. The adventures the children had was great. There are scenes that were funny. There are scenes that are serious for those who enjoy the plot. To sum it up, the plot is where the Kurousagi asked the children for help to save their squad in 'Little World'. The children had to build the squad from the bottom after a drastic incident. There are many problems the children had to face in order to help Kurousagi.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was great and enjoyable. The opening was well made. It is by Iori Nomizu and she tends to have a rock type music. It seems fitting because you want to have that bad ass feel when watching this anime. The ending was cute and I'm sure those who watched this anime have felt that the ending was good too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that this anime was airing at a wrong time (the winter season). Many people hated the winter season and this anime was what kept me through the winter season. I wanted to share this anime with more people that haven't seen it. It is great and if you like Sword Art Online or any of those fantasy adventures, Mondaiji-tachi would be one of your interest.",

            "content": "Have you ever had one of those moments where after you finished watching an anime series, you got a feeling of \u201cdamn, I wish I had finished this sooner?\u201d Or maybe, after you finished watching it, you thought, \u201cthis NEEDS a season 2\u201d. Well, I'm sure most people who have one of those moments sometimes in their lives after finishing watching a certain series. It can be something based out of enjoyment, something fresh or unique that you never originally thought you'd encounter, or maybe just something that was just hell out of a right whether subjectively or objectively. Regardless though, this series known asProblem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They sure hit one of those marks because I got one of those moments.\\n\\n\r\nMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? (also just known as Mondaji for short) is an anime series adapted from the light novel of the same name. The series takes place in a fantasy world featuring four prominent characters. I have not read the LN version of this anime so I came into this with a fresh start. But from what I got was more than just a fresh start but rather a pleasurable experience. \\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate things, the majority of the series takes place in a fantasy world. More specifically though, it focuses on the \u201cNo Name\u201d community, a place where there is trouble loose. It's up to our protagonists to help save their world after being invited by a flamboyant rabbit. Sounds strange right? This is obviously supported by the fact that the protagonists themselves are troublemakers. Take for example, Sakamaki Izayoi. He is portrayed as the badass and arrogant young boy. He does what he wants, when he wants, and how he wants. In general, he is a 'problem child'. His love for violence can be seen earlier on even from the pilot episode when he gets involved with some other kids. Yet behind that outer ulterior, we can see that Izayoi is a boy of intellect through his strategic thinking and ways of dealing with problems himself. At even one point, one of the main characters admits that \u201cyou really are smart\u201d directly. Despite his arrogance though, Izayoi does seem to care about his comrades and dangerous events as he puts himself at risk. The way he expresses it though...not so much being the 'nice guy'.\\n\\n\r\nThat of course only makes up one third of the trouble making trio.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the group are also two young girls named Kudo Asuka and Kasukabe Yo. They seem to exist in opposite of personalities as Asuka seems to be play the role of a girl who has a more open personality while Kasukabe Yo maintains a more quiet posture. This is even evident through Asuka's ability where she is able to command others through speech. And of course, they join in the fun after the faithful day when they are asked to help with problems in the 'No Name' community. In fact, all three of these characters seems to be bored of their normal day lives and seek a bit of joy. There's no better place to do that in the 'No Name' community.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which now, I almost forgot to introduce that certain bunny-eared girl. With fluffy ears, a shy personality, but a heart of determination, she invites the trouble makers to stop the trouble. So without further ado....let's introduce that Bunny Girl...Kurosagi! Literally translated as \u201cBlack Rabbit\u201d, she is the girl who sets the plot and gives the problem children a little joy to their boring lives. Although portrayed as being 200+ years old (is this even true??), she has the personality of a normal girl and that is being easily embarrassed at certain situations and sometimes insecure about the events going around her. However, there is one thing that is for sure. She wants to overthrow the Demon Lords from her world who have been causing nothing more than trouble. \\n\\n\r\nThe series adapts many supernatural and fantasy themes through its setting. In fact, the world that the problem children ventures into is nothing like the world they once knew. There are mystical creatures like dragons, jack-o-lanterns, vampires, and everything we don't see in our modern day world. Despite the dangers some of the creatures pose, the problem children deals with them like another day in the park. In fact, I can safely say that their abilities are far too overpowered with some of them literally getting back up after being battered, shattered, and broken. Izayoi's \u201cCode: Unknown\u201d along with his psychic powers makes him one of the strongest characters in the series. Because of his confidence and strength being nearly unrivaled, no wonder he is often so bored with his life. Asuka's power to control others through words is also seen as a very dangerous and useful ability that extents to animals, humans, and even other gifts. Last, we have the shy girl Kasukabe who rules over the animal kingdom with her skill to communicate and gain their abilities. If you put the three together, it seems to almost like a dream team. However, this is not always the case as the group seems to have problems and ideologies between themselves.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many adversaries in the series ranging from vampire lords to aristocratic individuals who claims themselves as Gods. They set the premise of this series as being the ones causing the trouble and it's up to the problem children to stop them. Yet, there are many instances in which the show takes the wrong turn and make their encounter seem too eccentric. However at other cases, I find the politics and rivalries to be entertaining; more often times with Izayoi because of his personality and speeches.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the series seems original, it does have a few issues. Personally, I found some of the jokes to be a bit too repetitive. This is especially true to our beloved little bunny-eared girl where she becomes the center of attention to lewd jokes. Although amusing to watch at occasions, it becomes old and repetitive. Additionally, the theme of traveling to another world to fight in competitions is not new. Series like Dog Days and Ixion Saga DT have taken such themes before and also performed similar stances. It's been done. The series' pilot episode also seems to be quite rushed with a lot of information thrown in at once rather than expanding them further. I guess this can be related to the issue with the length of the series. It's only 10 episodes so pushing it throughout each episode might of just been too much. Regardless these flaws though, it still makes its exciting point across.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, the series sets itself with the fantasy themes. The Little Garden, the way Kurosaki is dressed, and the mystical creatures are all proof of this. Additionally, the various games themselves revolves around events that are magical. However, I do admit that the characters' designs are a bit too generic. For example, Kurosaki fits into the role of the typical bunny girl with her outfit. The rest of the world where most of the events take place have that fantasy feeling.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the soundtrack, the series makes excellent use of its scores. The soundtrack works well in general and often or not, it's fun to hear it balance out between exciting moments (the game competitions) and some of the more lighthearted times. The OP song, \"Black \u2020 White\" by Iori Nomizu, is very catchy with the way it presents itself with words like \u201cbam!\u201d, \u201c1, 2, 3\u201d, \u201cblack, white\u201d, and other fun words being used. The ED song  \u201cTo Be Continued?\" by Kaori Sadohara gives the main characters a super flat deformed version of themselves and presents into in a fun way. (I'm looking at you Izayoi). It's pure fun to watch it to be honest. Do not skip that ED song.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is the golden egg for me in 2013 so far. Well, at least it's amusing and strange enough with its small cast of badass characters. Oh sure there is some fan service and dirty jokes here and there, but it overall maintains its themes well with the initial premise. In fact, most of the episodes sets with its intense atmosphere related to the games with the main characters each getting his or her own spotlights. And oh, how can we forget that badass Izayoi? The guy has both brains and the brawn that exists entirely opposite of the typical, wimpy, and indecisive male of a harem. So yes, this series was a surprise watch for me. It's only 10 episodes so why not give it a try?",

            "content": "I felt compelled to write a review for this anime so as to balance out any other reviews which might entice people to give this one a go.\r\nMy initial thoughts to this anime was that it was interesting, engaging and entertaining.  The initial premise of the series seemed interesting enough for me to continue watching it.  The animation itself is really well done for the most part, so I thought, hey, give it a go.\r\nAnd I'd say the first episode is engaging and humorous enough to make you watch a second.  But after, that's where it dropped.\r\nLet me explain:\r\nThe first thing isthe complete lack of explanation of the world in which the three gifted human protagonists find themselves in.  Although the three characters are likeable enough, I found myself very confused as to what the actual plot was about.  The bare bones I understood, but basically this was like a mmorpg set in Wonderland with a ditzy ecchi bunny as a tour guide.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially there are communities that have to fight, or play \"gift games\" (yeah, what the hell does that mean?) in order to win gifts for the community, so the community can prosper and move up in the \"world\".\\n\\n\r\nEach \"gift game\" has certain rules - that usually don't make any sense to the watcher -  that the \"players\" have to abide by.  But essentially the \"rules\" mean squat, the protagonists just have to beat up their opponents.  At first I thought the \"gift games\" would be interesting where the \"players\" would have to use their wit or skill to traverse and win, but the \"rules\" or mostly nonsensical, nonexistent, or completely superfluous to the outcome anyway, making the crux of all conflict in the world difficult to swallow.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists themselves have superhuman powers which the show doesn't explain at any point.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is the ecchi.  Okay, so maybe people like fanservice.  Hell, why would the animators do it otherwise?  But there is a level of, yeah okay I'm willing to overlook that, and then there is a point where I say it becomes distracting and pointless.  The constant sexual innuendo of the bunny is tiresome, and I found I couldn't think of a way to sit through the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd after 9 episodes I found the plot, or lack thereof, not deep enough, believable enough, or sustaining enough for me to want to continue.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like a very light-hearted and simple anime with a decent amount of mostly harmless but constant fanservice, I'd go for this one.  If you don't mind being confused about the story, or befuddled as to why the story is so lacking, then give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 4",

            "content": "\"I'm bored. I'm so bored. If i could sell my boredom, i'm sure i could make a living.\" -Izayoi\r\nEver dreamed of being the most powerful human on earth? The ability of giving absolute orders to others, or maybe be able to interact with animals? I'm sure you all have. But, despite having these great powers, three teenagers (or we could say problem children) from different worlds and timelines felt bored. That is until someday they got a once in a lifetime chance to abandon their worlds and live in a dangerous, strange, yet fun and interesting world called \"little garden\" instead. \r\nStory\r\nMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai karaKuru Sou Desu yo? follows the story of three problem children with psychic powers -and a rabbit- in a strange world called Little Garden, a world in which you must win the so called 'gift games' to achieve higher reputation or authority of your 'community'. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is served in a rather fast paced way, so fast that even yourself might not catch up. Even so, it was never boring. There's always something new and unexpected every episode. Several myth such as gods from greek mythology, mystical creatures, magical spirits are presented in the story, eventhough they were modified a bit. Well, maybe a little more than a bit. The Jokes aren't something that could be forgotten. Personally, it got me laughing everytime and i just can't see it coming. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter progression is something that is quite lacking in this anime. They're too overpowered from the start of the first episode to have a decent progression. But who cares when you could enjoy watching teens fighting gods and demons -and winning- with a little to no effort at all. You might see a bit of some developing interaction between the characters, but don't expect too much from it tough.\\n\\n\r\nGraphics are quite stunning. Characters and backgrounds are drawn nicely. The colors are put beautifully. Animation seems wonderful too. Simply put, artwork and animation exceeded so well. It went all up my to my expectations, no, even higher. Such beautiful art is what present animes needs to have. \\n\\n\r\nGiven all that, sounds are nothing exceptional. The soundtrack of this anime (the OP and ED) are originally made for the anime, and we could say that they did quite a pretty good job. I'm not going to go too deep on the sounds, but i could say it really makes the mood. I kept singing it for while after watching it (which i rarely do). But i think what matters the most is music tastes. I don't know what you guys think so the judgement is all yours.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words\\n\\n\r\n10 episodes may not seem as much, but those 10 episodes that i watched really got me on a string. I enjoyed all those 24x10 minutes very much. I didn't regret those times i spent on watching at all. I even rewatched it. Why? Because, umm ,you know, ITS SO AWESOME. I hereby highly recommend this anime for everyone looking for a good time to waste on their screens. Trust me. Have faith in my words. \\n\\n\r\nScore\\n\\n\r\nStory = 8\\n\r\nArt = 9\\n\r\nSound = 8\\n\r\nCharacter = 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 9\\n\r\nOverall = 9\\n\\n\r\nNote By\\n\\n\r\nEnding was left open, so lets all hope season 2 will come out soon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Every Friday I start my day off hoping this anime is subbed by the time I wake up.  \r\nStory:(9)it's original, fun and new elements can be added in each episode.  There are some parts that I would like to go in further detail but that just knit picking. \r\nArt-(9)The art is clean with nice visuals and good actions scenes.  Though I don't care for the visuals too much so I can't go in further detail. \r\nSounds-(9)The voice actors are all great.  The songseven remind me of is this a zombie?(which is great)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-(8)Now the 2 characters I love are black rabbit and Izayoi.  Black rabbit reminding me of hemeji from Baka and test.  While Izayoi is a strong character who seems to have it all.  Without going into to too much detail those two are defentitly refreshing from the weak willed characters.  My only problem is that Asuka and You do not have the same impact but that might change later since I am only 4 episodes in.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-(10)When I watch this anime time just seems to fly by.  I don't even realize the end of the episode until the ending song begins.  Some animes I watch, I always end up looking how much time is left. This anime always leaves me wanting more, which is all I can ask for in watching an anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-(10)My overall is heavily based on enjoyment, which is the most important element  in my opinion. It has a little bit of everything from action,fantasy,romance and originality. Hopefully this anime doesn't let me down and make me eat my words.\\n",

            "content": "Anime is a way for many of us to escape from our boring realities, and immerse ourselves into the worlds quite unlike our own.\r\nWhy did I start with such a cliche and cheesy statement on a review? Is this starting to sound like an essay? \r\nWell, to be fair, Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo (Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They) caters towards the type of individual described above. Individuals seeking to escape reality and adventure into a world of the unknown.\r\nToo bad the world in this anime stays 'unknown'.\r\nThere are many anime that take on the storyboard of'traveling to a different dimension'. Its a born and bred technique that, with minimal uncertainty, will definitely succeed to draw in the common anime watcher. Anime like Log Horizon, SAO, and No Game No Life first come into mind. However, with all my pride of an anime watcher at stake (if I have any), I will say that there is enjoyment in seeing this style of anime does entertain me to a certain extent. The creativity of the setting astounds us, and the ideas hidden within the protagonist's strengths evokes our imagination.\\n\\n\r\n'Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?' follows three characters with the extraordinary powers. The Strongest human, the ability to interact with animals, and the voice of absolute command are all, 'coincidentally', powers that immediately pop into the mind when speaking of supernatural powers that everyone wants.\\n\r\nThese three characters somehow are summoned into the dangerous world of 'Little Garden'\\n\\n\r\nHardly dangerous. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the anime was very fast in introducing the power of our superhuman Izayoi, who defeats a water 'god' in the span of 2 episodes. its a common event that we see in some anime like this. Antagonist underestimates protagonist at hand greatly, protagonist demolishes them with an unexplained skill, and the antagonist regretfully admits his/ her mistake. Of course, on paper it sounds cliche and cheesy, but fans love the moment when the antagonist is overwhelmed due to their sheer incompetence in fighting. Come on Water God, don't challenge our shounen protagonist with only your puny god fighting skills.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is hardly to blame for this. We see it regularly. Sora and Shiro from No Game No Life easily dispatch their humanity hating enemies. Don't get me started on Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. In fact, this anime does well to show that brute force doesn't always win battles compared to the others. Strategy actually appears, albeit occasionally, in the anime. When it does, its hard to watch, as the enemies are so remarkably stupid it makes the strategy in place look well thought out.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the anime did well in though, was introducing the setting and story. The back-story is developed fairly well, and the majority of the plot-holes in the history that appear are subsequently covered with a brief explanation. Our protagonists discover the dilemma of the community of 'No Name'. This community was at the bottom of the food chain in the world of Little Garden.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the story does not go in depth however, is the setting itself. Remember when I said the world stays unknown? The beautiful, imaginative idea of Little Garden is hardly developed. Its a flaw in the style of anime. Make the anime short and risk under developing the setting. Make the anime long to delve into the world and lose action and fast-paced storytelling along with it. Its a problem that is hard to correct. \\n\\n\r\nFor a anime that deeply involves its characters into the plot-line, Character development is a missing piece to the puzzle. A short 10 episodes may attribute to the lack of development, but the reality is, the characters have no where to go! The moment the land on Little Garden, our protagonists are as overpowered as Goku is by the end of Dragon Ball Z. There is a bit of marginal growth for our characters power wise, of course with the exception of Superhuman Izayoi, who is so perfect in the power category that its hard not to become worse.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes I go quite overboard with my little jabs at anime. The artwork in Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? is beautifully done. Characters have no glaring differences in artwork from one point of the anime to the next. The backgrounds are populated with significant detail. Every character looks unique in their own way, and are very distinguishable through artwork.\\n\\n\r\nThrough there is far little in character development, the personalities of our protagonists are actually very unique and fairly intriguing. Each character has a unique personality that quite often suits their abilities and appearance. Because of this, when these characters initiate their abilities, it actually feels as if the the abilities they possess are unique to them only.\\n\\n\r\n                                       ...\\n\\n\r\nWhen individuals rate an anime, they rate it either through their enjoyment or how well the anime is made. Of course, both these two factors influence one and another, but they are also distinctly separate. Someone can watch a plot-hole filled, disturbing, unimaginative anime and still receive enjoyment because it may fulfill with what that individual may want. Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? has some glaring mistakes that all anime of its type possesses, but I cannot say that it didn't have its good points, and that I didn't enjoy it. Many of its problems revolve around the shortness of the anime, along with the cliffhanger ending. However, there is more to come, and when that time comes, there will be individuals to either praise it, or judge it no matter what the outcome. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 - Good\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Please don't think that 6 is bad, for those of you, because I base my ratings off of the word descriptions (ie good, very good, mediocre) rather than the number)\\n\\n",

            "content": "UPDATED 3/15/13 FOR FINAL EPISODE\r\nIt may not be the case for you, but I've had trouble finding some decent anime to watch. I went over maybe 10 animes so far, dropping each one until I finally decided it was time to watch this one. This anime surprised me beyond my wildest expectations. When I read the plot synopsis, I thought it sounded a bit cliche. However, this is far from true. The anime brings to the table amazing characters, a gripping plot, and hours of enjoyment to come. \r\nStory 10/10: This story takes some elements of Dog Days and turns it into a more shonenesque anime. Essentially, its like a more grown-up version of it, with actual fighting instead of just doing obstacle courses. The plot is a bit cliche, with the whole reclaiming honor thing, but the character's emotions and feelings really keep the plot interesting. I feel that at any moment, a small twist could potentially turn the entire anime upside-down and make it into something spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: 10/10 Ok, the anime took an amazing turn toward the end, and really had me hooked in right up until the beginning of the ED. I loved how the story ended up as, and I hope many of you guys think so as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: There are some parts in the anime where it's amazingly well detailed, and some parts where I wish there was more to absorb and look at. My favorite scenes are when the two main girls (You and Asuka) are together in some sort of comedic scene (episode 2 especially (we regret nothing)).\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: 10/10 There's an amazing scene in the last episode (no spoilers) that made me want to pause the video and look at everything. Honestly, I feel like the artistry in this one episode alone is enough to bring it up to a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound  8/10: One thing I have to say is that the OP for this anime is simply amazing. The music is easily one of the most catchy I've ever heard, and I often spend time listening to it on loop while doing homework. However, during some parts of the anime itself, there's this one sax solo bit that doesn't fit well with what's going on in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: 8/10 The last ED (which isn't really an ED, but still) fell a little short imo. However, it doesn't change the score much imo.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Here the anime really shines. All the characters have their own problems (Izayoi not so much) that drives them together to help Black Rabbit retrieve her banner and their community's name. Overall, the characters' personalities are the main selling point of the anime imo. \\n\\n\r\nUPDATE 9/10 A lot of the characters I feel didn't get enough screen time (cough cough You cough cough), and thus weren't able to get an in-depth analysis as it were. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: From enjoying Izayoi's badassery to Black Rabbit's fanservice (light, but there nevertheless), the anime hooks me in from the moment it starts up until the op (which I skip, aint nobody got time for dat (but it is actually pretty good)) and from there until the ed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: Really enjoy this anime, and if it weren't for a few small problems, I would give it 10/10. To anyone who enjoyed stuff like Kaze no Stigma, or likes the idea of a male lead who's a total badass, I would recommend this.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: 10/10 Simply amazing, I'd recommend this to any fan of anime, just because of the amazing story, characters, and enjoyment. :3",

            "content": "First time writing a review but I've wanted to give it a go for a while now.\r\nAnyways!\r\nFor me this was one of those anime that gets you so engaged that at the end of each episode you are like \"god dammit not another week!\"\r\nWell it was like that for me.\r\nFirst let's talk about the story, not going into this too deeply the story is about three kids from different backgrounds who have a gift and are sort of bored with their lifestyle until a letter appears transporting them to this brand new world.\r\nThe series revolves around gift games. These are pre-arranged battles with specific rules.In such games I suppose one could say a wager is placed. I want to explain this more but I really don't want to spoil anything! So just watch ha.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is beautiful. I can't say much more about this. So much \"aww factor\" The ending is cute!\\n\\n\r\nSound, well the voices are beautiful fitting the characteristics of everyone perfectly! and the music is fitting. I love the OP theme so much and the ED theme is cute but not enough to avoid being skipped now and then haha.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Well perfect!\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist is so cool. (like he should be) the female leads are cute. What I liked about this anime is that even though vulnerability was around it wasn't to the point where you had wasted episodes of the characters reflecting on how much they suck and just being a downer. Which in all fairness I understand why it is used in most anime as it gives us something to relate to! but we don't need that in this one!\\n\\n\r\nIt's all about being awesome. Because you know. It is. which brings me to enjoyment I loved this anime. What more can i say? The fight scenes are amazing! So much diversity and not every battle is the same. Each fight had a different purpose and type of opponent and the tactics changed making things so much more interesting! \\n\\n\r\nAnd fan service? Well the problem with a lot of anime is that they rely on just fanservice for their laughs. Which being a guy I get it. (yeah you know what i mean -dirty grin-) but in this anime i wouldn't say it was suttle but it was just not overpowering? If it was removed yes it wouldn't be so funny but the anime would still be great!\\n\\n\r\nSo overall? I gave this a 10/10. The few qualms I have are that the anime is too short! and because of the attitudes of the characters you kind of know how things are going to end but that is made up for with how they are going to get there. But yeah, this has to be the best anime this winter. So much rewatchability, there's a few episodes that I watched an extra time already.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this to anyone whether they be hardcore anime nuts or just casual. There is something here for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading. I hope my first review was good enough. see you again. Maybe. :)",

            "content": "Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? is a very good anime series. It's a kind of Alice in Wonderland mixed with Fairy Tail sort of series. Each of the three main characters have unique abilities and they all fill a nice little niche in this show. I have to say that it is much better than it sounds from the synopsis, and it had me from the first episode. This series is a high 8 in my book, and I highly recommend it.\r\nThe artwork and animation are of course very good. In the last few years animation has really shined with embracing highdefinition, and there is a certain quality that we are getting used to (and in some cases expecting). This series holds that quality and doesn't waver. It has catchy intro music, and the songs throughout each episode fit very nicely into the story. Best of all, the voice acting works really well. This series delivers in the most basic and necessary of areas which gives it a couple of shiny gold stars.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are kind of up and down. I think it was the amount of young children characters that filled the story. It was a bit much at times, but the main and most important of characters were so well done that I could ignore that fact. Everyone had bright and lively personalities, and they were developed very well considering the lack of background stories. In fact, we do get a little of a couple characters backgrounds, but mostly we are left with questions. It's not a major flaw in the design, but it is what brought the series down to an 8 instead of a 9 for me. I wanted to know much much more about the main characters because that was the biggest mystery in this story.\\n\\n\r\nMentioning story, I do have the say that the simple yet entertaining plot was fun to watch. I compared this show to Alice and Wonderland and Fairy Tail for a very big reason. You get your zany magical fighting and action, and then you have your bizarre spiritual world storyline/themes/concept. This is not a ripoff of either, it's actually very different in a lot ways, but it just reminded me so much of those two. The entire point of this story is that these three human kids from different dimensions have to help save this community of \"no-names\" by competing for them in magical games in this sort of fairy tale/spiritual dimension/world. If you love fantasy, that's what you get.\\n\\n\r\nWhere this series goes wrong is in how short it is. I wish it was done in a few more episodes. I wish we had more background of the characters. I wish I would stop saying \"I wish\". Seriously though, it has some flaws, but I really enjoyed it. It has high repeat value, and it has a lot of good things going for it. It is based on a light novel series that I have not read, but I hope there is more to come in a second series/season. If not, then I can whimper and say \"fine\" and maybe deal with the cliffhanger/open ending that we are left with.\\n\\n\r\nAll that aside, this is a must see for fantasy geeks like myself. It's fun and at times a little exciting. It has good humor and much more. Check this short series out.",

            "content": "It's kinda sad that I have to give this show such a low score but it was just very generic... enjoyable non the less, but generic.\r\nFrom the synopsis it already sound generic as heck, 3 teenagers with superpowers go to an alternative reality to fight a demon lord. Well if that isn't something we have never seen before...\r\nStory\r\nThe story makes hardly any sense and I also had a hard time following all the concepts that are thrown at you. That was mostly because of the bad pacing the show had. It felt really rushed (obviously with only 10 episodes) and thus never had time toexplain anything in greater depths.\\n\r\nWhat was that world, how do these gift games work, how does the whole timeline thing work. All these things have to be excepted to enjoy this show, because they get loosely attention, while the story never really focuses on something.\\n\r\nWell besides the whole No-Names and building up their reputation.\\n\r\nOn a good note I can say it was sometimes really funny and because of its length never felt unimportant, the episodes also all were quite enjoyable to watch even though it kinda jumped in time here and there without any sense of progression.\\n\\n\r\n4/10 Decent\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nFrom a realism point of view the characters all felt quite one dimensional and stereotypical, but have shown possible character development. It all hinges upon the number of Episodes and how they tried to tell and show you as much as possible, character had almost no time to establish. But they sure gave all the characters their screentime without focusing on one too much and on the other to little.\\n\r\nMotivations of all characters felt very sketchy though, be it villain or hero. They all just kinda did their stuff.\\n\r\nBut I can say that I still greatly enjoyed them. Izayoi was pure gold being a bad ass superhuman he was, was fresh and entertaining. The girls where all likable and gave you some fanservice points if you are looking for that, at least each girl was for some sort of fetish available.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 Fair\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nStudio Diomedea who animated this show didn't really do anything outstanding.\\n\r\nActionscenes were mostly cut and static, or did use pan shots to save work/money. Overall the quality was rather generic as well as the artstyle.\\n\r\nI did like the character designs. They kinda reminded me (in case ofAsuka) of Type Moon. It didn't look bad but also not great. There isn't much to say here to be honest.\\n\\n\r\n5/10 Mediocre\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening was pretty cool and I liked that Iori Nomizu sung both (OP and ED).\\n\r\nI liked her performance in the openings of Kore wa Zombie desu ka? a lot, this song wasn't as great as the catchy rocksongs in Kore wa Zombie desu ka?.\\n\r\nThe Ending was kinda meh... didn't like it.\\n\r\nThough both fit the show, energetic, kinda cute.\\n\r\nAs already mentioned Iori Nomizu voiced Kurousagi and I just like her.\\n\r\nThe other VAs did a good job as usual in most anime nowadays. Nothing stood out besides Satomi Arai which has one of the most unique voices in the buisiness. She is known from the Raildex shows as Kuroko and I just love her quirky voice.\\n\r\nFunny thing to mention as a side note, in this show she also plays the roll of a lesbian pervert DFC loli...\\n\r\nThe OST is forgettable and not mentionable.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nValue and Enjoyment\\n\r\nI fused both to one together because they are kinda similar.\\n\r\nI think I will not re watch it or some episodes, but I sure would watch a second season if one comes out.\\n\r\nOn a sentimental level it had no big impact. I don't wanna keep it, or will remember it for a great anime I've seen. It was enjoyable as it lasted but nothing worth while.\\n\r\nOn a historical level there is no arguing that this anime will be forgotten quickly and will have no impact what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the characters, from both an design standpoint and form a personality one. The opening was also okay, but the rest was kinda meh.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime gets a 5/10 which is sad, I think it could have been better. \\n\\n\r\nBut as said in the introduction, it was really enjoyable. If you are looking for some fantasy action show with some cool characters that are a but out of the general stereotypes give it a try.\\n\r\nIf not you are not missing out.\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so the 10 episode anime has recently ended and I like the fact that studio Diomedea has limit it to just 10 episode, so without further adieu, I present my ratings for this anime:\r\nStory & Art: Mediocre 5.\r\nThe story is a typical good versus evil kind of thing which is more likely appropriated for audience who are in a age range of 10 to 15 years old since the main climax was typical of people from another world whom where called upon to help fight in an alternate universe and in this case it revolves around the 3 teenagers from another world with specialabilities called \"Gifts,\" who where invited to join up with the \"No Names\" by a seemly clumsy bunny girl named \"Kurouasagi,\" in order to participate is the so called 'Gift Games.\"  The Art in general was for me...................just the usual though some Kurousagi fanservice would have added some spice in it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI simply just like both opening and closing theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nNow the thing about the characters in this anime, more emphasis was given to  the 3 teenagers which is good, but the let down was Kurousagi, she did invited the 3 teenagers to come to the \"  Miniature Garden\" and participate in the \"Gift Games\" but for her to stand as a regulator of the games while belonging with the \"No Names\"  was a bit odd. I'd probably say that her character to not fight for the 'No Names\" unless there where circumstances that permits her was a total misplacement for her role. Writer  Tar\u014d Tatsunoko\\n\r\n should have considered Jin Russel be in the shoes of Kurousagi, and Kurousagi should have had a separate role one which she has no alliance with anyone except be the game moderator.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the enjoyable part of this anime was action genre combine with fantasy which was based around the 'Pied Piper of Hamlin,\" but generally speaking   it was Izayoi's kickass action that makes up for the enjoyable part of this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime did have a comedy genre, but it was limited to Kurousagi being pissed with the 3 teenagers who are looking for action, thought the title  \"Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\" trasnlates to \"Problem Children are Coming from Another World, Aren't They??\" was a bit of a patsy it was fair enough to be enjoyed. But for this anime to be given higher score for its overall, doesn't really count since studio Diomedea misuses the children's fantasy story \"The Piped Piper of Hamlin\" by giving it a darker side was unnecessary to say the least, as for the anime's title, it is something that should have been use in a genre that has a extreme action where the so called problem children are the main bad guys.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd so my review ends, will this anime have a season 2?????I think studio Diomedea should just limit it to a couple of OVA's.",

Which brings me to the why in the hell is there only 10 episodes of this anime. BLASPHEMY. \r\n-Story-\r\nThe three main characters have these amazing powers and are bored with the regular world. An envelope arrives for each person. They've been summoned by the Black Rabbit to help the community \"No Name\" to overthrow the Devil King.\r\nWhat I absolutely love about this series is how they incorporate mythical stories and what notinto the anime. I haven't seen something this good along those lines since Campione! \\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nThe art is incredible and the characters are drawn so very well. Every character has their own unique charisma about them. Everything is colorful, the girls are cute. This is the first time I think I fell in love with a furry.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nIt's sound. The ending and opening themes are okay. Nothing extraordinary about this series. The cast is very awesome though. The way Kurousagi answers Yes in English is very cute.\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\nThis brings the best out of the show. Due to the nature of the show every character good or bad is unique. because of the mythology incorporated into the show, this highlights how well this series is. Izayoi is the strongest badass around. Asuka needs a little more character build up, but she started to shine in later episodes getting a grasp of her powers. You Kasugabe is a unique design with the qualities of animals. Kurousagi (Black Rabbit) is just awesome all together. almost a female version of Izayoi.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nThis series is totally worth every minute and numerous amounts of re watch. It isn't super fan serviced at all. It's just about perfect all around. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\nFun and exciting. I can't believe it is only 10 episodes long. I hope to hear an announcement for a second season soon.",

            "content": "It's easy to say if an anime is a Light Novel adaptation just by how long is the title. Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo don't escape the rule. Only 4 episodes are out, but by seeing how a lot of animes of this winter are boring, it's not an exaggeration to make this one of my favourite. \r\nStory - 7\r\nThe story focused on 3 childs who received a power at birth, named 'gift'. They are sent to another world by Kurosagi (Black 'sexy' Rabbit) to help her with her community.\r\nSince this world turn around a 'gift' competition, the show mix action, fantasyand supernatural. \\n\r\nThe story in itself is good, it has some suspens, and is correctly developped.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nSmooth and clean. Character design is one of my favourite, and backgrounds are nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe opening is amazing, and the ending is funny. The sound don't seem bad during the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nWhile Izayoi is your average clich\u00e9 of overpowered-highschool boy, which I really like, the others don't really shine by themself, apart from Kurosagi who is quite funny and support what you can call a light fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nIt's really interesting to follow this show, since there is some mystery, specially about Izayoi's gift. I'm personaly following this show with impatience and interest, and surely until the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nIt's really easy to give it an 8, since it's pratically the only supernatural and action show this winter, supernatural being my favourite genre.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're going to watch this show, you should have some things in mind. Firstly, there is some 'light' fanservice. It don't really disturb the show, but some are so haters of that, that it might be underlined. Then, it's a Light Novel adaptation, so, to keep the book being saled, it have some lacks in the story and character development. If you saw Sword Art Online, then you can deduce that it will have the same sorts of lacks, as a rushed story for example.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into supernatural, over-powered children and a little of action and fan-service, you should give it a try.",

            "content": "Fantasy, Supernatural, Action, and a little dash of Comedy. Those are just some of the ingredients that make up Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?. A Girl with the \"Geass\" type of gift, A Girl with a wooden necklace that can copy a gift of another, a high school boy that has an unknown gift that could kill gods and destroy the heavens, and lets not forget the bunny girl with huge, um... you get my point.\r\nStory/Plot: 7/10\r\nI'm quite a little bit disappointed in the plot, it has this feel of having the same flow as the anime \"Fairy Tail\". \r\nLet me sitethe plot flow of the two anime:\\n\r\n1.) Problem rises involving their Guild/Community.\\n\r\n2.) Group shows a little worried on the current situation.\\n\r\n3.) Anime shows a little shady background of an unknown character.\\n\r\n4.) An/Most of ally gets Wounded/Captured.\\n\r\n5.) Protagonist defeats the enemy/ wins the gift game.\\n\r\n6.) A new ally is accepted to their Guild/Community.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i'm saying here is that Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? has predictable outcomes so far after viewing the 5 episodes. The male protagonist is obviously  \"Imbalanced\" in a very obvious way of defeating Gods. But hey, the series ain't finished yet, we'll see if this deserves more than 7 in the future.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nJust awesome, Animation is not the \"Moe moe\" type that i love, but it still gives that feel of a satisfying animation. Surroundings are well detailed as well as the characters. And may i just add, this anime has one of the best ED animation EVER! The chibis dancing in a very smooth way just makes me very very happy, and that's the main reason i gave the animation a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSounds here are great, the voices of the characters matches their appearance/mood. Background music was fine, yada yada yada. OP Music is like the Kore wa zombie desu ka OP/ED Music, which i find very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are very good. Although the other one that has the \"unknown\" gift is too much. Overall an 8 is quite enough. Girls that can Copy and Command, a vampire/a former demon lord, a teenage high school boy with a gift that destroys the heavens. But the bunny girl does it all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nDepends on how we define Enjoyment in an anime. Some defines enjoyment as having the feeling of impatience or more specifically, can't wait for a week for the next episode. Some define enjoyment as loving the twists in the plot, and making predictions and being able to discuss it with others.The unique set rules in every gift game made me excited(By finding loopholes in the rules.) and those two definitions about enjoyment made me give the 8 out of 10.Yeah sure, we all think a week is torture for waiting for the next episode, but i find this anime hard to discuss with other people, well mostly because we all have the same ideas on whats going to happen next. Unless this anime will reveal more secrets in the future. Don't forget were only halfway through the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.4/10\\n\\n\r\nEverything is very good, except for the plot that is. A no name community that was destroyed by demon lords. Suddenly three humans with extraordinary gifts is called from their own worlds by a bunny girl(Yey!). Now they plan to revive the community to its former self. Pretty good so far right? But the Hows are my problem...\\n\\n\r\nSo how do they revive the guild? \\n\r\n-They participate in gift games and win!\\n\\n\r\nSo how do they win in gift games? \\n\r\n-By using the girl that can command almost anything.\\n\r\n-By using the girl that can copy the enemy's abilities.\\n\r\n-By using the high school teenage boy that can destroy the heavens and defeat the gods.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nProtagonists are imbalanced, and didn't show any costs on using their powers halfway through the series. Though, it's still a must watch for me, and highly recommended.",

            "content": "What can I say, after finishing this 10 ep anime, I'd say that I find most of it's category as pretty much mediocre. So I'm no longer gonna make any deliberations and I'll just get straight to the point:\r\nMediocre 5.\r\nStory- The story in general was typical of a group of weak members who needs to outsource it's battle by taking in a trio of special kids whom are too bored in the world they live in, which for them to be in such alternate universe like the so called 'Little garden.' and as usual it involves a lotta made up terminologies like the Conejo Negra's( I'm referring to Kurousagi) gift called \"Spear of Indra,\" Izayoi's  \"Code: Unknown,\" Asuka's  \"Oraculum\" and You's \"Genome Arbor - Non Priorum.\" Where them trio ( the conejo negra not inculded)  have to participate in the watchamcallit  \"Gift Game,\" and as usual of a typical fantasy genre it shift's from one plot to a sub plot and to another plot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-  The tres adolescentes which were compose of Izayoi, Asuka and You are not bad in respect to their roles, since they are the problem children that this anime's title was referring to. But to call them problem children was a bit of an overstatement since they don't look like a trio of delinquents rather they're just bored. But the Conejo Negra (I'm referring to Kurousagi)... well, I don't dig as to why she's given that name since only her top blouse and her knee high socks are black- I don't know about her underwear, anyway for a character like her to be given such a name is befitting for an antagonist or to a support character who is protagonist with a dark side  and if I were director, Yasutaka Yamamoto, I would have given her role to Shiroyasha. Also, her role is some what of a double standard that though she is a member of the 'No Names' she is also the overseer of the 'Gift Game' that she cannot fight for her own side unless there are certain breaking of the rules that permit her to do so which is why she should have been in the shoes of  Shiroyasha, and Shiroyasha should be in the Conejo Negra's shoes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Humm, so I may have given this anime's enjoyment a mediocre score, but still it was enjoyable enough to be watched since this anime has an action genre in it where the battle between good and evil is something to look forward to and that's as good as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall, the title \"Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\" really doesn't befit this anime as a whole, but given the action part of this anime, I'd say it was still worth giving it a benefit of a doubt. I do commend studio Diomedea  for just limiting it to 10 ep.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDecent 4.\\n\\n\r\nArt- I can only say that the art was wholesome that there was no fanservice for the pirreos to howl for.\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3.\\n\\n\r\nSound- I hate both opening and closing themes, finish.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAdios amigos.",

            "content": "*This is a review of the original ten episodes and the OVA.\r\nThis was a series that I was really interested in watching, but never really got around to it until the summer of 2014. The title by itself was interesting enough, but after I had read the plot summary and saw that it had received good reviews, I decided to watch this series. I enjoyed watching it so much that I decided to re-watch it last week, and while I didn\u2019t get the same amount of enjoyment from the first time I watched it, Problem Children was still a really fun series to watch.\r\nStory:\r\nProblem ChildrenAre Coming From Another World, Aren\u2019t They (Problem Children)\u2019s story revolves around three humans with extraordinary abilities. These abilities make everyday life extremely boring or unfulfilling for these individuals. That was until, one day, they each received a mysterious letter that said that if they gave up all of their friends, family, and worldly possessions, that they would have an opportunity to test the limits of their powers. They are then transported to the world of Little Garden, a world inhabited by several different types of creatures, and run by a series of supernatural events called \u201cGift Games\u201d. The three humans run into Black Rabbit, the being who summoned them to this newfound world. They quickly discover that Little Garden isn\u2019t just fun and games. Little Garden is the home of several different communities, each having it\u2019s own name, flag, and status in the world. Black Rabbit is a part of the community known as the \u201cNo Names\u201d because all of their status was stolen from them during a Gift Game against a demon lord. She brought these three problem children to Little Garden hoping that they would join the \u201cNo Names\u201d in their quest to recapture their lost status.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I enjoyed Problem Children\u2019s story, it definitely had its flaws. The first issue I have the story is how many things weren\u2019t fully explained or explored. The biggest question I have about the story is about the world of Little Garden itself. You\u2019re not really given much information about Little Garden other than the fact that it exists, and while they do mention something about a \u201cParallel World Intersection Theory\u201d it is never explained. Little Garden also seems to have elements from several different works of literature and religions. It showcases characters and tales from Shinto to the Brothers Grimm, and they never explain how any of this works. Also, Little Garden is massive, it was estimated to be about the size of the sun, and so much of the world isn\u2019t shown or explained to us. They mention that there are several communities and races within the Little Garden, but we don\u2019t get to see a whole lot of them. Which is definitely a shame, because the world itself is extremely interesting and I would\u2019ve loved to learn more about it. The final issue I have with the series involves one the series\u2019 main plot points. That being how exactly did the demon lords forced the now \u201cNo Names\u201d, and others like them, into a gift game where all of their status was on the line. It\u2019s another thing that was never explained in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also doesn\u2019t come to a very satisfying conclusion. While the last episode does wrap up the events of the conflict that was taking place, the journey of the \u201cNo Names\u201d was far from over. The characters had even set goals that they wanted to accomplish earlier in the series, and we never got to see those fulfilled. Overall, even though it was a good ending to the arc they were in, it wasn\u2019t a good ending for the series, so lets hope they decided to make a second season.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the OVA, extra fanservice aside, it just felt like more of the same, which was a good thing. But, it just served as another reminder that the story isn\u2019t over. It\u2019s never specifies whether the events in the OVA take place during or after the events of the first season, but either way it only makes you want more.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t a whole lot to say about the animation other than that it\u2019s good. Everything in the series is animated really well. The character models, background scenery, and fights scenes are all done really well. While there is nothing spectacular here, it is definitely good, quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nProblem Children has a vast and varied soundtrack with songs that can compliment any scene in the series. If the scene is tense and a little creepy, a tense and eerie song will compliment it. If the scene is lighthearted and upbeat, the soundtrack provides us with a lighthearted and upbeat song to compliment this as well. The soundtrack features songs that have a good amount repeatability, and is complimented by a solid opening and incredibly catchy ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis series stars four main characters, the three \u201cProblem Children\u201d You Kasukabe, Asuka Kudou, and Izayoi Sakamaki, and the person who summoned them to Little Garden, Black Rabbit. As mentioned earlier, all the three of the problem children have special abilities that made their lives boring or unfulfilling, which is why they were invited to Little Garden. During the course of the series, you\u2019ll start to understand why each of the characters decided to come to Little Garden, and see them start of growing as characters. Initially, the characters might just seem like incredibly basic and one dimensional characters, but as the series progresses you\u2019ll start seeing that there is more too them. That being said there really isn\u2019t a massive amount of character development, especially for Black Rabbit and Izayoi. Those two characters are also the ones who we get the least amount of background information about.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are likeable and enjoyable to watch. The characters deferent personalities worked well together and made their interaction entertaining to watch. For example, Black Rabbit is easily flustered, and even though the You, Asuka, and Izayoi are taking on the huge responsibility of rebuilding an entire community, they are still problem children. The are constantly doing things that Black Rabbit doesn\u2019t approve of, and that creates some very funny moments during the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a decent amount of side characters in the series. For the most part, they are all given a decent amount of screen time, and at least a little background information.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren\u2019t They?. The story was interesting, the animation and sound were really well done, and the characters were very likeable and enjoyable to watch. I\u2019m really hoping for a second season so that I can see how the story ends.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict and Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3.6/5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4.3/5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3.7/5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4.1/5\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 3.9/5\\n\\n\r\nProblem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren\u2019t They? is a very good series that will keep you entertained from beginning to end.",

            "content": "\"I'm bored, really bored. If I could sell my boredom, I'm confident I could make a living.\" -- Izayoi Sakamaki\r\nThere were some moments in this anime where I thought exactly this. Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? or the English name for it Problem Children are coming from another world, aren\u2019t they? (addressed to as Mondaiji in this review) is an action anime and is very proud of being one \u2013 the anime has action flowing from its ears! Now by excluding things like plot and character development, Mondaiji has done two things which are very noticeable:\t\r\n1.\tLimit your audience.\r\n2.\tMinimize the critique which canbe thrown at you.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot centers on 3 main protagonists, namely: \\n\r\n-\tIzayoi Sakamaki\\n\r\n-\tAsuka Kudou\\n\r\n-\tYou Kasukabe\\n\\n\r\nThe first of the three: Izayoi Sakamaki is a very arrogant and cocky boy. He will do anything to get his dose of entertainment. The second is Asuka Kudou, the archetype rich girl would fit her very much, and she seems to be able to do things with her own two hands. So I wouldn\u2019t say she is that much of a clich\u00e9. Lastly, You Kasukabe, the quiet girl of the trio. If you have seen more than a dozen of anime, she should strike you as similar. Now these three get an envelope and they are magically teleported to a place called Little Garden. They are to entertain themselves with Gift games here and to join a guild. These Gift Games can be about anything and for anything. They can help the guild you join grow, or for personal pleasure. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, they are roaming free in a MMORPG world. \\n\\n\r\nIf you paid attention to that last line, it will sound very familiar. Indeed, they have also jumped the bandwagon of incorporating MMORPG features in their anime, the 2 before them are Sword Art Online and Accel World and have done similar things. But everyone has their own perception and ideas; you can do a lot of things with the gaming theme. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I found a rather good move on the author\u2019s part was to really target a selected audience and stick with it. The fact that the main characters have no flaws, the story is not deep whatsoever and that it has a gaming theme. With these facts you can easily pick out the audience the author was trying to reach with his writing: the gamer audience who like short, sweet and action-packed anime (and might not have too large of an attention span). With this move you won\u2019t entertain the watcher who comes across this and tries it on a whim, so I would say this anime has its fair share of dislikes due to the small audience it targets.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the plot: Non-existent. Yes, unfortunately this anime doesn\u2019t have much of a plot. It has one, but it is put on a sidetrack. The main characters try to revive a guild that was destroyed by an evil demon lord (which we do not see in the series). Now that is its plot, what do they focus on? Fanservice, fighting things for no good reason and generally lure you towards watching it with pretty visual and before mentioned fights. Now, with a series that lasts 10 episodes (10 x 24 minutes), you wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on both the plot and actually fighting without moving the story slower than a snail\u2019s dead born hatchling. So now you might be wondering, does this show only deliver fights? Yes, and with quantity.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights which sometimes are with reason and sometimes not, are phenomenal eye-candy and most likely the only reason you would like this show. Now the so called \u201cgifts\u201d of this show are pretty much psychic powers, the show does a very bad job at explaining what gifts can include and what kind of gifts exist. \\n\r\nBecause the show does not clarify this, the fights the show produces are sometimes somewhat hard to follow. The main thing which irked me about this is that the main male protagonist is a mystery. He just seems to have high physical abilities. Keeping a lot of things shrouded on the action which is their main attraction is a very bad move.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing which caught my attention is the fact that they go out of their way to include a lot of stuff (the fact that elves, dwarves etc exist), but they never do anything with this setting. All the characters have a human form and the whole concept is forgotten about, except for the small fairy which appears the last two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nNow on to some positive qualities this show possesses. Not that I enjoy this myself, but the fanservice was done in a way it didn\u2019t become annoying. The girl characters didn\u2019t become tools for the fanservice moments which happened each 3 minutes. Although there was the occasional lewd moment, it was done subtle and I probably could count all the moments on 1 hand. So hats off to them for making it a bearable experience for the female watcher.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that this is only 10 episodes also has its positive effects. Since you spend a measly 240 minutes on this show, it isn\u2019t that big of a time investment. So even if you disliked it, you wouldn\u2019t have wasted that much of your precious, precious time. The fact that it had created such a big world with so many possibilities could mean that they can obtain a return in a year or so, depending on BD sales and other merchandise. If they were to get another season, they would have plenty of potential material. \\n\\n\r\nHow it breaks away from other action anime is quite the pleasant surprise as well. Most anime around that genre with the demographic shounen attached to it are about the main protagonists overcoming hardships. The antagonists for each arc are consequently beaten to a pulp without too much effort. This one is quite different, the characters are already on that level, and they have nothing to overcome. So I guess you are in for a surprise when you watch this anime regardless of what you expect or do not expect. Now from what I gather on ratings and personal opinions, a lot of people liked the completely overpowered main character who wipes the floor with each adversary he comes across. Personally, I like my characters to have a taste of defeat, but again, this way it complements the fact that the series is only 10 episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the animated part of the series, this includes how the characters are drawn. This is my main point of critique on this section as well. I found the characters models to be very bland. And why in god\u2019s name is Izayoi wearing those headphones - is he listening to music 24/7 or something? Now on to more relevant stuff... The animation was absolutely amazing in this show; you would expect that when it comes to fast moving characters and projectiles the show would make them a tad static. Although there is a hint of it here and there, the actually animated parts are done nicely. So that is a plus which I would like to give it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that concludes our animation section, as I do not know enough of studios to compare this work to other stuff they did.\\n\\n\r\nNow the sound, we can separate this into:\\n\r\n-\tSoundtrack\\n\r\n-\tOps/Eds\\n\r\n-\tVoice actors\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was done up to a good standard. They had some fast paced music in there when the characters were fighting and slightly, more relaxed music as they were having a conversation. The opening and ending were pretty good. Now my main taste is definitely not in J-POP, but I kind of liked these ones. As for the voice actors, they did a fair enough job I\u2019d say. The main male who has a very arrogant and cocky attitude was done well by his respective voice actor. I think the rest of the cast has done a quite good job as well. \\n\\n\r\nWe have arrived at the character section now. There isn\u2019t a lot left for me to say. We will start with the English title; Problem Children are coming from another world, aren\u2019t they? Because problem children are what they are, they constantly try to entertain themselves, at the cost of other characters, whether it is the supporting cast or the antagonists. I talked about archetypes in the beginning of this review, the princess one/tsundere and the silent girl/kuudere one. Although there is hardly romance in this anime, so the tsundere and kuudere are not really necessary, we could view these girls as such. I think the writer has done quite well to break away from the clich\u00e9; both are not annoying within their role. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing which I found mediocre on this show was the motivation, especially when they are interacting with each other. \u201cIt will be fun.\u201d This seems to be the sole motivation for each character \u2013 and to be honest, this is a bit on the weak side.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let us move to the conclusion. So overall I thought Mondaiji was a weak anime, as it did not have a concrete plot or any apparent character development. Although these words might seem harsh, I did in fact enjoy Mondaiji. The action in it was sublime and I was as excited as any jolly teenager would be seeing this. I give it 5 out of 10! \\n",

            "content": "Ok, when I see a \"PG13\" rating next to an anime, it is a clear indicator, to me, that it is childish and boring, save Fairy Tail, Dog Days, One Piece etc.\r\nThe only reason i even considered this anime was: 1. I was bored \r\n 2. It had a dog days recommendation.\r\nBut I was outstandingly surprised with what was presented, and I enjoyed this thoroughly and with a light heart.\r\nThe Story: 8: This must have been modelled around dog days, people coming from an other world to participate in events and games (believe it or not, but war is a game in Dog Days.... whoknew...) and to bring strength back to a community that is in a tough spot. Really enjoyed it =D\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9: Very colourful and happy, with even the nights being light up with a shower of oranges, reds, yellows and other bright colours. It is a very light-hearted art style that was a very refreshing splash from usual\\n\\n\r\nBut like all good thing this anime had its moments that were obviously made for the younger audiences with little or no over-the-top kind of fights or battles (wired, considering they are trying to defeat a demon...) that sort of makes fights seem less serious than they are\\n\\n\r\nIn short is was very entertaining and enjoyable to watch, I loved it, and anybody who loves a good comedy and funny main, I suggest you watch this now!  \\n",

            "content": "Have you ever wished life was one big game? Who am I kidding, we probably all have. For whatever reason, we wish life would lose at least some of its boredom. Maybe you find school to be naught but a chore. Maybe your job is tedious and your boss is a dick. For whatever reason, you find yourself trudging through life, unable to enjoy anything. Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? Is an anime that explores what it would be like if the world were decided through games. Games of all sorts and varieties. You set up the rules, place your stakes, andplay. Oooohhh, how I wish. They say that if you find a job you love, you'll never work a day in your life, and I feel this anime is one of the shining examples of that belief. \\n\r\nI say that everything is decided through games, but that may be a bit misleading. Sure, there are a good number of literal games one can play. You want to challenge someone to pick a specific card from a deck, by all means, place your bets. But, if you want a contest of strength, where the victor is the one left alive, that's ok too. Everything in this world goes, you just have to establish the rules beforehand. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nI'm going to be quite honest, I loved this story. But a bit of clarification in saying that- The idea of people getting transported to a foreign world to assist some underdogs in some sort of conflict is nothing new. But thanks to MAL's scoring system, I throw both the premise and the world under the category of story. This world was one that I found entirely original, and that's pretty rare these days. As you likely gathered from my preface, this is a world where everything is decided through games, \u201cGift Games\u201d to be exact. The games have predetermined rules that cannot be broken, but they do not have to be completely clear for both parties involved. The games even have overseers to ensure the rules are followed. The gift aspect of that title arises from the tools participants utilize in the games. These gifts have a wide variety of possibilities, ranging from a super-power to a magic item. Did I mention that by the way? There is magic in this world. Rather, it is more accurate to say the world is magic. \\n\r\nThe world is named Little Garden. I don't know who chose this name, as it is pretty bloody far from the truth. The world is said to be roughly the size of the sun, which means it is roughly 100 times larger than the Earth's surface. Whoever decided to throw the adjective little into the name of that world certainly has an odd sense of humor. Many of the denizens of Little Garden are members of a community as it is recommended to be in one if you are to participate in a Gift Games. The communities are as they sound, a community of people. But I found that they were very comparable to a guild, like one may find in an MMO or watching Fairy Tail. A group of people who come together under a single banner to live on the same land, work together, be a team, be family, etc, etc. The specifics would vary depending upon the individual community. \\n\r\nWhat I really liked about this world was the lack of a happy go lucky vibe. This world wasn't perfect, there existed slavery, kidnapping, blackmail, poverty, and death was a realistic consequence. It added an extra degree of immersion knowing that though they are called games, that was really just an illusionary pleasantry. These were high stakes contests with realistic consequences. \\n\r\nWith all of my praises, you may be wondering why it is only rated as an 8. The answer is due to the simple fact that so much of this world and its nuances remain unexplored. I have questions left about the specifics of this world, the Demon Lords and their powers, the No-Names that the story focuses on. We just aren't given enough information. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe animation was very solid on the whole. The action scenes seemed fluid, I loved the scenery, a wide array of vibrant colors. I also was a big fan of the character designs, they were all memorable and an aspect I was a big fan of. \\n\r\nI am also going to mention the ending theme in this section. Sure, \"To Be Continued?\" by Kaori Sadohara was a catchy little song, but the real reason I watched it so many times was the chibi art-style of the main characters dancing. It was just so much fun to watch, it never failed to bring a very large grin to my face. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \\n\r\nThere isn't a ton I can say. The OST was solid on the whole, but none of the tracks jumped out at me as being spectacular. \\n\r\nThe voice acting was pretty damn good. I have only seen the show subbed, so I cannot make any comments on the quality and/or accuracy of the dub, but the sub felt almost perfect. There wasn't a single voice I didn't find fitting, and to the opposite effect, I liked every single one. \\n\r\nThe OP was awesome. \"Black \u2020 White\" by Iori Nomizu was a very good song that quickly found its way into my musical library. The visuals were pretty good as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nI don't know why, but many anime throughout the years have habits of making the main characters fairly weak characters (in terms of their capabilities). Whether or not they remain weak is irrelevant, but weak characters are a very common trope. Maybe people just love the underdog story, maybe it is so the weak and timid viewer base can insert themselves into a given situation with relative ease. Whatever the reason, thank you for the breath of fresh air Tar\u014d Tatsunoko (the author of the original light novels, I just looked it up). These characters are immediately established as being skilled. But having skill alone is not the recipe for a good character, I can point out a dozen gary stus that suck as characters. These characters all have their own bit of charm, and it makes them an extremely fun and memorable cast because of that. \\n\\n\r\nIzayoi Sakamaki- Here we the ultimate badass of this show. This guy has confidence and cockiness seeping from every pore in his body. Is that imagery a bit weird? Sorry for that, but it's accurate. He is an extremely capable fighter and he is quickly established as being intelligent as well. I'll be honest, he is a bit OP, but don't let that deter from thinking he is a good character. He isn't a perfect nice guy, he isn't the type to get involved in every one of his friends' problems. He is a bit of a pervert, but not the over-the-top get a nosebleed kind, but a confident one who will compliment a girl and give a descriptive run down of her outfit and how it perfectly accentuates her curves. This guy honestly is just a pleasure to watch. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Rabbit- The bunny girl who serves as the primary source of fan-service for your viewing pleasure. Ok, there is a bit more to her than that. She is a girl who brings the problem children into her community, and in a sense serves as their caretaker. Rather, that is what she is supposed to do. Quite frankly, she is outclassed. She tries to be oh so serious, but thanks to the eccentricities of the other characters, she often ends up in a flustered state. She is not incompetent, but she doesn't seem to shine as brightly as the problem children... * wink * \\n\\n\r\nAsuka Kudou- She is the rich girl character. She immediately displays this high class, haughty, arrogance that could only come from someone born into power and money. That is just her initial appearance however, and you see she is actually a fairly kind girl who is also highly intelligent and perceptive. Of the main cast, she receives the most (and best) development. \\n\\n\r\nYou Kasukabe- Here we have the fairly quiet girl. Note, she is not a Rei Ayanami or Yuki Nagato, just a fairly quiet girl. I draw the distinction because I don't often see characters like her. She isn't shy or socially awkward, just quiet. But usually quiet characters are taken to the very extreme, but she strikes a nice balance. She is a nice girl with a good heart. Oh, and she can speak to animals. \\n\\n\r\nGranted, Asuka is the only character who benefits from any real degree of development. But despite that I still give these characters a score of 8 because they felt so individualistic and memorable. It is also their capabilities. Izayoi is most definitely the powerhouse of the show, but the other characters always have a role to play. Correction, it is a pivotal role that they play. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nI use anime as a form of escapism, and this anime fulfills that to a tee. Magic, fighting, and all in game-like format. The characters were awesome, and their early escapades across this world created fun and exciting situations with a unique flare I have not seen demonstrated elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nIt's a high 8, but not quite deserving of a 9. This was an amazing world and concept with a very fun cast of characters. Its greatest downfall is ultimately the fact that it only received 10 episodes. The show thankfully didn't try and cram too much into this less than one cour time-frame, but it leaves a TON to be desired. \\n\r\nThe show is short enough that it feels just like a long movie, so it isn't even a massive time sink. This anime is most definitely worth a watch. Even if you don't latch onto the world or characters as much as I do, the whole show is just a big ball of fun.",

            "content": "Tired of all your beta main characters? Well Mondaiji-tachi is one of those anime that has an awesome main character. It isn't like your typical fantasy adventure anime, but an action packed anime with good comedy. Prepare to join the world of 'Little Garden'.\r\nIzayoi Sakamaki may be one of the bad ass character I've seen. He isn't as beta as Ichika Orimura from Infinite Stratos. Before I go down explaining the characters, there are two type of main characters; alpha and beta. Alpha main characters would be one of the main character that viewers would like and would be a dominant person rather than backingoff in certain situations. Beta main characters are characters that are indecisive and doesn't know how to handle an event. The current anime trend tend to have beta main character as some may see them cute. Now Izayoi is one fine gentlemen that was able to deal with many situations which makes me enjoy the anime. It wasn't rage inducing because I didn't feel disappointed in his decision makings. The only anime that I can see has somebody that is similar to Izayoi is Kaze No Stigma. The other characters like Kurousagi, You Kasukabe and Asuka Kudou are very unique. Having the anime explain the backstory of where these children came from made me feel that I was able to connect with the characters. It is significant because they're all from different timelines and each one have their own problems. Thus, it makes the title: Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They?\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was great. I was able to enjoy it because of the action. It may be cliche, but it followed the light novel. It was sad that the anime only became a 10 episode anime. There are more materials in the light novel. The adventures the children had was great. There are scenes that were funny. There are scenes that are serious for those who enjoy the plot. To sum it up, the plot is where the Kurousagi asked the children for help to save their squad in 'Little World'. The children had to build the squad from the bottom after a drastic incident. There are many problems the children had to face in order to help Kurousagi.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was great and enjoyable. The opening was well made. It is by Iori Nomizu and she tends to have a rock type music. It seems fitting because you want to have that bad ass feel when watching this anime. The ending was cute and I'm sure those who watched this anime have felt that the ending was good too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that this anime was airing at a wrong time (the winter season). Many people hated the winter season and this anime was what kept me through the winter season. I wanted to share this anime with more people that haven't seen it. It is great and if you like Sword Art Online or any of those fantasy adventures, Mondaiji-tachi would be one of your interest.",

            "content": "Story: 5/10\r\nEpisode 1 was probably the most interesting episode out of all of them. It definitely succeeded in making me interested and catching me on and making me continue. The downfall of this anime though was that it was completely rushed, maybe because it was only 10 episodes? The whole anime felt like half of a regular anime if you know what I mean \"time-wise\". Because it was so short, I didn't really get attached to any of the characters or even caring about them because even at the end, so little is known about them. The one who's most backstory was revealed was the\"little oujo-sama\", and the other two I have like absolutely no idea about. Was pretty disappointing and I'm hoping they don't mess up if this anime gets another season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nAs stated above, the only past you get a reasonable glimpse from is Asuka's (the rich-girl-character) and barely anything is revealed at all about the other two main characters. There was a point in the anime in the hot springs where the black rabbit asked of their pasts but one of the characters quickly changed the subject. Another thing that was disappointing to see through my point of view was that there was absolutely zero \"clutch-moments\". You know, when a main character could potentially die, get wounded, or injured, etc... Those moments that bring you closer to the character and make you \"care\" about them a bit more. Yeah, there was none of that. The whole anime was basically watching these incredibly overpowered as **** characters wreak havoc on everything. Okay maybe there were some injuries, but there wasn't a doubt in my mind the whole entire time that it could ever end badly for these guys. Especially for the male lead. The whole anime went by with him starting as OP and ending as OP - and he's not even at his limit yet. The other \"unknown\" girl (I'll call her animal-girl), also had like the least screen time of any main character I've ever seen. She got one episode to herself, and then that was it basically. It's even obvious from what I'm typing at the moment.. I just finished watching this anime in one go and the only name I remember is the rabbit's, because her name was Black Rabbit (Kuro-Usagi)!\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending were okay, and extra points for chibi-ending. During the anime I recall many times were there was no music at all when there should have been. I always say this, music is what seperates the good anime from the great anime.\\n\\n\r\n[video=youtube;ySn55tUVfxM]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySn55tUVfxM[/video]\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nAt least there's nothing wrong with the art~\\n\r\nProbably one of the key factors that stopped me from dropping this other than the fact that it was only 10 episodes. Art + Animation 10/10 though~\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this anime. It was boring, nothing really happens in it, and in the end I wasn't engaged in it at all. It had ridiculously Over-Powered characters, nothing is known about them, anime ends in cliffhanger --> season 2. The only thing it had going for it was the nice art and animation. I just wanted it off my plan to watch list because it was only 10 eps. Maybe it's because I marathoned it and didn't watch it weekly? One thing that I can say for certain though, is that this anime definitely doesn't deserve many of the scores and reviews that I saw for it.\\n\\n\r\nWouldn't recommend this to anyone, could barely call this an anime. It's too incomplete.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL RATE: 30/50\\n\r\nA grim and sad truth.\\n\r\nI was expecting that this anime would have been better as I heard and read many good things about it, but I came out disappointed in the anime and even more disappointed in the people who told + wrote such things. If this were to get a second season I sincerely hope that they don't mess up as bad as they did with this.\\n\\n\r\nIt definitely had potential.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations:\\n\\n\r\n- Sword Art Online -\\n\r\n- Haguure Yuusha no Estetica -\\n\\n\r\nIf you like incredibly Over-Powered main characters then you'll like these as well~\\n\r\nAlthough, Sword Art Online had an amazing OST so you'll at least feel more engaged in it.",

The side plots are interesting too, there is not an inch of boredom from a story perspective.\r\nArt: (7)\r\nThe art is the standard type you see in a lot of anime, nothing to special, but definitely proves it was made in the 2010's. The colours and flashiness from the special attacks are perfect though.\r\nSound: (7)\r\nThe soundtrack isn't something that will stick with you for the re3st of your life, but it definitely is fitting to the anime and doesn'tseem out of place. The opening and ending are quite catchy and really fun to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9)\\n\r\nThough the main characters in the show are mostly developed before the anime begins, the show really makes you fall in love with them quickly. The comedy effect makes them that much more loveable. Though they are already developed to a certain point, they still remain a mystery to us, the audience and along the way we find out more and more. The characters are what really makes this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9)\\n\r\nIt was a light-hearted and fun adventure. It is definitely easy to cheer up after watching it, it has a soothing atmosphere that makes it a real pleasure to watch. I think ill rewatch this a few times, because it was so fun.\\n\r\nHas so much potential, unfortunately this is another anime that is just a advertisement, or tease, for the light novel. Dont expect the main plot to uncover by the end, its just trying to suck you in to buy the light novel, still a fun and awesome adventure. If the anime was 50+ episodes i sincerely believe it would be worth a 10.",

            "content": "I was only able to watch 6 out of the 10 episodes of this anime, partly because my eyes glazed over as this anime did another explanation of some rule or reference and gave a mini wiki page about it and partly because I don't want to. Some of you may call this inaccurate, I call it efficient. \r\nThe plot is weak at best. 3 Kids get sucked into a wormhole and end up in some rpg type world where races and things of all sorts duel each other for supplies, goods, people and clan rights(which all gets explained in a monologue). They meet fan-servicerabbit and join her recently destroyed clan that has nothing but starving kids. They lost everything in a forced duel with bad people (no explanation here) and now are going rebuild and fight the bad people using the three kids that somehow got there. The general premise is overly complicated as before each new thing they introduce, they go through a monologue: Here is mushroom kingdom, the inhabitants are the cybermen, otaku, and spartans, don't worry though there is a natural light barrier that keeps the light out and otaku happy, also blahblahblah.. \\n\\n\r\nThe over-the-top details however aren't as bad as the details that are left out and these details are the important story line ones. Both parties need to accept the duel before it is started. However the bad people can challenge us and take all our stuff even though we never gave consent.~no explanation~ (screw the rules, I have money). The bad guys have a name but we don't know what they really look like or the reason why they did this action.\\n\\n\r\n It also doesn't make sense why the three kids like each-other and like the fan-service rabbit and her flea-bitten kids. The 5 second back story for each of them implies that all of the three are lonely but that makes sense because one is a control freak, one is a sadist, and the last only talks to animals. Now for some reason now that they are in a new world, they are social butterflies that do good for other people. They could go with the new world, new person path but they don't change personalities when it comes to interactions with people outside their clan. Why does the male lead wear earphones that aren't connected to anything? Are they earmuffs or is he secretly listening to Beiber or secret orders from Kim Jong Un? So many important questions go unanswered in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the art it makes Dragon Ball Z look like it came out last year. The music and sounds they play have little to no correlation to the anime and its as if the video and audio department were communicating through a pasta noodle that broke in the middle. The OP is about being forced into a imprisoning world and destroying that world but the three kids were gods in their back-story worlds. The characters and their personalities make no sense nor are they consistent and are molded to the scene by the convenience of the author.\\n\\n\r\n The light and dark in this anime are poorly balanced and this is easily explained in the scene where the main characters joke about the sexual use of the fan-service rabbit then when another character proclaims his lust the tone went from joking about sex to chauvinistic men-are-pigs attitude. It's almost as if the anime tried to pander to all ages but its too dark for children and its too childish for adults. \\n\\n\r\nI watched this anime all the way to the 6th episode because I like giving anime a chance to surprise me, even if it starts off poorly, with something innovative or good. The only thing that has surprised me about this anime is how I've lasted through the 6th episode without melting my brain",

            "content": "First off, this review probably contains little to no spoilers, so you are probably free to read it without having any major spoilers seen in here. \r\nStory - 8/10\r\nAs a 10 episode anime, I can't really give the story higher than an 8 since it was too short. There were bits and pieces I didn't really get in the story later in the anime, it's like something was being cut off from the original light novel of this. I did like the small story this anime gave us though. It's hinted that they will release a season 2 of this due to the flying letterin the very last second in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to give something a 10, it would be the art. Amazing character designs, especially the black rabbit. The scenery was quite nice to look at as well, and the special effects during some of the fights (especially the last episode).\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song was amazing, and so were the BGMs inserted into the anime. I only heard the ending song once but it was quite good as well. Not much I can really say about the sound, so I'll skip off to the next topic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll start off by saying, Izayoi is that calm MC which you see in some anime, but at the same time he is hungry for fights. The way he was so bad ass was actually refreshing due to the recent trend of wimpy characters. Maybe bad ass characters don't develop much, but I still liked this guy quite a lot. Second off is Shiroyasha, she's just a hilarious character in anyway, she literally lusts upon the black rabbit in every way, and I think Shiroyasha and Izayoi would make an awesome team in terms of perverseness xD. I liked most of the characters equally except from those 2.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I enjoyed this, it gets a 9 and not a 10, since as I mentioned in the story, there were bits and pieces which I couldn't understand. I enjoyed the comedy the most in this one, and the fighting scenes of course.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd again, overall it gets a 9. It was a very good anime and I really enjoyed watching it, especially because of Izayoi. I would recommend this series to a lot of people who are looking for an fantasy/action/comedy anime. This series is basically the bad ass version of Dog Days, but ten times better, and the MC isn't a happy go lucky person.",

            "content": "Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? (TV): Let\u2019s Have Fun!?\r\nImagine that you, from birth, had been granted the ability to control the will of your surroundings; or, perhaps, that you were given speed that would give even Sonic the Hedgehog a run for his money. This is the basic setting of the anime \u201cMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\u201d which directly translates into \u201cProblem Children are Coming from Another World, aren't they?\u201d In terms of initial characterization you\u2019ll almost immediately notice the weak individuality of the characters, which is to be expected of a show that will only last for 10+episodes. Even though most of the main cast, meaning You Kasukabe, Asuka Kudou and Izayoi Sakamaki, have their own separate backstories, they tend to act and think as a single unit. This makes longer sequences with dialogue drag on without much variation. The introduction of Kurousagi (The Black Rabbit) is a fresh addition to the cast, however, she contains little personality and seems inessential, except for future scenes containing fan-service. With the plot centering around the characters mentioned above, being sent to another world where only the strong survive and where you literally put your life on the line, there definitely is a strong foundation for future events; however, due to the short length, this also somewhat forces the company to rush the plot along.\\n\\n\r\nDiomedea, formerly known as Studio Barcelona, has managed to provide us with a series that surely has the potential to turn into an absolutely gorgeous anime. Having produced the \u201cNogizaka Haruka no Himitsu\u201d series, and also having supported several mainstream releases, the company certainly has enough experience in the short time it's been around. This doesn\u2019t mean that the artwork is without its faults, though, when comparing it to similar releases. This is definitely a step in the right direction for the studio.\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching a series like \u201cMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\u201d it\u2019s important that the viewer understands that there is the possibility of a lack of character progression. The plot will almost certainly be deficient in several key areas. This possibility has already been alluded to with only minor introductions to several elements that could have easily been explained further in the story's progression; such as the gods, demons, parallel worlds, abilities etc. The series can also be compared to \"Dog Days.\" Both share the \"person in a strange world\" theme, characters were brought from their respective worlds to participate in games and there are several factions vying for dominance. Although \u201cMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\u201d only has 10 confirmed episodes, and an additional OVA, it has the potential to stand out as one of the greater series to be introduced to the fantasy/adventure genre.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a deep plot with tons of symbolism and a profound message, then this isn't the series you're looking for. However, if you want to watch something with a bit of fan-service and people fighting to defend their principles and morality, then you've come to the right place.\\n",

            "content": "\"There's gotta be something fun going on. I'm bored. Really bored. If I could sell my boredom, I'm confident I could make a living.\" - Izayoi\r\nThis is the first thing we hear when we start this anime, and it really tricked me into thinking this Anime might be you know, somewhat decent. Also when you use quotation marks make sure it is exactly what the character says because that is what quotation marks imply. \r\nIf you've seen this anime and you liked it a lot than you aren't going to agree with me very much because, I don't like this series very much at all.\r\nStory:4\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nThe premise of this plot is a group of three kids with special \"gifts\" get brought to this world where you play games and bet. The games include \\n\r\nanything from card games to duels but they could practically be anything. This series washes any potential away for these games to be interesting by making each of them a duel in some way, and since the main male character (Izayoi) is the equivalent to Gogeta SS4 any real danger is undermined by his unbeatable powers. This really switches into a typical shounen Anime when you realize it's story follows a pattern of introducing the problem in then solving it in a couple of episodes, there is no overlying problem in this anime the protagonists are trying to solve, unlike in Naruto or Sword Art Online.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nThe Art is average for a series released around this time the \ufb01ght scenes look all right. Character designs are awful for the most part, who wears headphones for no reasons too look cool? You just make him more of a dick by the minute.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\n-------\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very forgetable because I \ufb01nished this series today and I've already forgotten all the music except for the OP which I did actually enjoy. One of the things that pisses me o\ufb00 the most about this anime is the voice of Shiroyasha, just like when she was Kuroko in A Certain Scienti\ufb01c Railgun her voice is extremely shrill and annoying, making her almost unbearable to listen to, I felt like crying whenever she spoke and I'm a man (at least I like to think I am).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nThe show truly is dragged down by the characters, all the main characters are both uninteresting and have almost no back story. To establish depth in characters, anime typically give you either a back story or through important events that occur in the show, neither of those are given to us in the show except a very simple back story where it tells you the rich girl (Asuka) was bored with life because she has the ability to control people and the cat girl (Kasukabe) was in the hospital for some unexplained reason, excuse me if I don't care cat girl. All side characters are completely pointless and add nothing to the show, the big chested bunny rabbit (Kurousagi) is simply there as eye candy and to explain historical events of importance. The emotionally repressed loli vampire maid (Leticia) is as one dimensional as characters come, she is simply a damsel in distress during the \ufb01rst half. Emotionally repressed female characters are over done in anime as a whole, she proves this point. The main character male character (Izayoi) is so \"badass\" always wearing headphones plugged into nothing which would be more of a nuisance than anything else. He has that \"I don't care\" attitude which just pisses you o\ufb00 at times because his overpowered power which was magically granted to him and he didn't have to work for it even one bit he takes for granted; listen if you want a character to be a badass make him work for that strength not just magically grant it to him. Oh, then there is the leader of the no-names, Jin Russel the 7 year old who seems pointless. Seriously who is stupid enough to bring average kids to this fucked up world with demons and gods who seem to be assholes? You've got a group of children living together without any parental supervision?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nI enjoyed the \ufb01rst couple of episodes but the action got repetitive and boring. There were some funny scenes but the humor is kind of childish and unoriginal, it's what you would expect something like Naruto to do. You might enjoy this anime if you like very generic story lines and characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nAnime is kind of bad, doesn't bring much originality to the genre. A series that is currently airing that is much better so far is \"No Game, No Life\".",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nPeople often have a fascination when it comes to \"super powers.\" Common heroes include Superman or Spider-Man, with the powers they have being extraordinary in comparison to the people around them. This idea resonates with everyone, both young and old, because it's something that realistically will never happen. But if you did have such powers, would you use them to fight for the good of the nameless, or would you wield them to dominate your foes? Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They? (and I thought Fate/kalied's title was long!) explores these ideas but with improperexecution in tow.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nProblem Children stars three teenagers, You, Asuka, and Izayoi, who each have special, otherworldly powers. Upon being summoned to the \"Little Garden,\" they finally have the chance to use their abilities to the max.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire premise for the show revolves around the idea of \"Gift Games.\" For those that have seen No Game No Life, the similarities are rather obvious. Rewards are wagered, rules are set, and the outcome is determined by the actions both parties take in order to achieve victory. The games played themselves are rather simple but usually pretty entertaining: pick the right card, defeat the monster, solve the riddle, etc. However, it's what goes on during the game that matters most. But therein lays the problem.\\n\\n\r\nThis show suffers from something I would call \"convenient inconveniences.\" In other words, several of the plot points or narrative choices are taken out of left field, are not fully explained, or merely brushed aside. This becomes heavily apparent as the show nears its conclusion, with many happenings and events that perfectly allow particular instances to occur that would otherwise not have. The issue really isn't in them having such inconveniences, but having them so blatantly upfront without much thought. It makes part of the experience rather hard to stomach.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with Problem Children is in the world building. The show does attempt, at certain points, to describe the way in which the world operates. While it focuses mainly on the games themselves, these, too, have facets attached to them that go largely unexplained. Concepts such as the \"Demon Lords\" or Black Rabbit's innate ability are presumably just accepted as existing without so much as back-story to aid them. This may be an issue with the show's timing; resting at only ten episodes, it doesn't have too much to work with. Initially, I thought that the show's decision was because this was all the time they needed to craft their story. But instead, it works against them, making it painfully clear that as much information was crammed into it as possible, while other pieces were left to fall on the wayside.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, one small gripe is the inconclusive ending. The show leaves numerous loose ends in all directions from previous engagements. It even looks to introduce an entirely new plot point within the final few seconds. Again, this could be a time issue, but the amount of unanswered questions when all is said and done is quite vast and quite unappealing.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nProblem Children's art and animation is, for the most part, good.\\n\r\nThe art style for the show tends to stick to mostly vibrant colors. Soft pinks, bluish indigos, bright reds, shining yellows; it isn't afraid to be colorful when it needs to. It can also turn about-face and stick to more gloomy ones, such as dark purples or rough grays. In short, the color palate is varied and surprisingly catching to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as character designs go, most of the people presented are somewhat boring: You and Izayoi are given the typical girl and boy look, respectively. Even Black Rabbit, despite being ultra adorable, has only her ears to distinguish her from the rest of the cast. The only two characters I found to be captivating to a degree were Asuka and Leticia. The former's red dress and fair looks make her seemingly Tohsaka Rin's sister of Fate fame. The latter has two rather interesting designs that come forth depending on the situation. Leticia's two designs contain notable contrast, and they fit well with her overall character.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the actual animation, the show tends to do nicely in the fighting department but gets weak when outside of it. There are large explosions, sword swinging, and gryphon riding, all of which are nicely animated during their segments. Otherwise, the show tends to err on the side of caution and has its characters refrain from much movement when outside of battle.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nProblem Children has a medium sized cast, but I will maintain my focus on the main four: You, Asuka, Black Rabbit, and Izayoi.\\n\\n\r\nStarting off, You is young girl who is quiet and kind, yet strong when needed. She is smart in that she doesn't make decisions without first deciding whether or not the result is a favorable one. I found her to be the worst of them mainly because she doesn't contribute much, both in terms of help and in terms of her overall presence. The latter part is more than likely attributed to her personality, but it weakens instead of strengthens her character.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is Asuka. Beautiful, mentally sound, and aiming for a change to her everyday life, she is the one who is always looking for a challenge, no matter how big or small. While she initially seems rather snobbish, in actuality she cares deeply for her friends and the people dearly close to her. She's not completely standoffish, but she is definitely not afraid to speak her mind.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Rabbit, as her name would imply, is a rabbit-girl who is the first person that our main girls and guy encounter. Happy, helpful, and hearty, she loves to play and ref the Games while also providing assistance to her own community with each available opportunity. She's also not afraid to go all-out, should the situation present itself. Being sexy and cute is also a plus in her favor; however, she is pretty much the poor-man's Holo.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the best character from the show, Izayoi is the typical \"Gary-Stu.\" He is cocky, rather intelligent, and unfairly over-powered. He serves two purposes throughout the show: to conquer the games and to provide solid entertainment. His arrogant attitude is not without merit, as he constantly proves throughout the anime, but he does seemingly have a small soft spot when it comes to the weak.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are undeniably fun, there is no questioning that. The problem here, however, is that beyond being fun and having their character traits, they are all quite bland or generic. No one is really memorable for who they are, because every character has already been done before and better. On top of this, while minimal character background is introduced, we hardly learn anything about the characters themselves. Besides the powers they have and small snippets of flashbacks, there isn't much to be had.\\n\\n\r\nCaring for the characters is also a major issue. They are all so strong and formidable on their own that even when things look dire, it's an inevitability that they come out on top, simply because that is the way the show portrays them. This feeling causes the viewer to not care as much for the characters, because he/she knows nothing bad will really happen to them. As such, their overall likability decreases.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP can actually be quite catchy, especially with the \"1, 2, 3!\" portion. It's heavy on the guitar and the drums, and provides a good feeling of rock and roll that goes along nicely with the \"over-powered\" vibes.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is just way too adorable. The singing is very fun and girlish, and the visuals quadruple the cuteness that the song dishes out. The \"Oh, Yes!\" part, like the OP, is catchy to hear.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, for the most part, is not that good. However, there is one piece that I quite liked, even if it wasn't played all that often. It's difficult to describe, but it was usually played when game or rule explanations were going on. It had a \"double-note-trail-off\" that sounded very ambient and cool.\\n\\n\r\nFor voice acting, there were no stand-out performances. The voices attributed to each character worked fine for what they were, but beyond that there is nothing of note.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nGoing into the show, it's important to know that the characters are ridiculously strong. Not just compared to the worlds that they came from but also among the citizens of the \"Little Garden.\" For this reason, the show provides a fun time for the first half of the show showing off what everyone has to offer. Each of their abilities is unique to them and they all get used in a variety of different situations.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the halfway point, much of what goes on is old or re-used from the first half, so it isn't as enticing. Instead, at this point, the show introduces two hilarious, awesome, and cute characters: Deen and Merun. While their roles are incredibly insignificant in the grand scheme of things, their one-liners, speech patterns, and way of acting were a joy to have on screen while some of the monotony was kicking in.\\n\\n\r\nI think the best way to describe Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They? is to say it is \"No Game No Life if it were turned down about twenty notches.\" This show is occasionally funny, sometimes cute, but not very dramatic or intense. By the end, while one part of you wants to see where the characters will go from where they have been left off, the other parts just aren't in it.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, had potential but loses out to \"convenient inconveniences\"\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, wide use of colors with above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, all are fun but not much else\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, catchy OP and ED, okay soundtrack and VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, an easy ride the whole way through\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\r\n Review?:\r\nMINDSET:\r\n This series is something that not many will put up there as one of there more favoured shows in many stretches of the imagination. Its a short breather to take in, and Season 2 is probably 6 millenniums away to be released, so I don't commend You to wait.\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nWhen do people start slamming there key boards with unorthodoxly long titles? Well its a mess to type down all of that jazz. (Lets call it Mondaiji for short) A trio of random teens were all of a sudden conveyed in a fantasy realm conquered by demon lords,it is represented in a twist parody with a sexy Rabbit Chick as their guide as they immediately start beating everyone into a pulp. Does our Trio does any jack for jack, other than infinity looping the same kinds of jokes?\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nWe can start of with the fact that our teen-trio don't really do much other than fight people and loop the same jokes, it doesn\u2019t help the fact that they seem quite shallow in personality as the archetypes always seemed to be governed by one trait. (for 100th time) I swear, none of these characters even get developed at all, they just know each other for a bit to grasp each others personality, and shallow writing starts working on the authors favour...\\n\\n\r\nEven by simply watching this show for the comedy, seemed like the wrong and disappointing mindset, the characters seem to trample over everything in this amusement park, while the writers are trying to convince us to feel some level of sympathy of such characters, by saying:\\n\\n\r\n \u201cHey, look we know these characters are OP and such, but look! We have these sad pieces back story they have in the real world, and look! These little kids are all orphans, and we must protect our newly found orphanage from these demon lord bags!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n It means nothing in any part of the duration if the show is also trying to build some level of tension since we all know that this part of the cast are completely over powered. The fans of the show are all raving about how much of a BAMF  the male lead was, but this blonde guy just feels as powerful as the other two girls! And he's no different as some generic over powered guy hole that according to Anime logic, smiling in any fight scene means Your one of the OP.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the other such cast, the supporting roles are completely two dimensional clich\u00e9 people, they have bare minimum for there entertainment value unless if there powerful in some way shape or form and apparently according to the fan base, Powers = Complexity (yeah, makes a lot of common sense, right?)\\n\\n\r\nThe story feels like its done better before in other fantasy shows, (so there\u2019s nothing to speak of there) however, I think the greatest strength of the show is trying to achieve is  character appeal,  which is the main reason the casual viewers are here for, not some epic tension raising fantasy war drama filled with the blood of two factions for blood shed!\\n\\n\r\nWeighing the production values, the art is just, there to be sufficient at its job. There\u2019s nothing special about it, other than the fact that the Anime uses a brighter colour scheme, the demon designs are generic, and have little charm put into them. The only flash I notice was the bunny girl, because she kind of looks appealing. Not in the sense of \u201cHot\u201d because I already grew out of the generic Anime design conceepts within less than a month.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, is so meh, even the battle music feels meh, we have techno beats, the over used electrical guitar and such and such. But the only thing not worthy was the slightly more above average J-Pop OP, though done before and better with other titles (like NGNL) other sounds such as Voice Acting, sound effects etc. are all mediocrily sufficient at its job. \\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nI never thought the male lead would have such a large fan base in both genders in the first place. He does seem more different compared with Your generic Harem lead, but for the critic, its just shallow writing... This show wont have much impact in any level, at all, its biggest advantage would be light watch, and a few chuckles here and there. I watched it, and forgotten all about it. Its not sooo bad, but nothing that special (or legitimately \u201cgood) either. This show has no value, and I don't give a damn if You watch or not watch it.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n3.5/10 \u2013 For completely shallow character appeal, the only thing appealing for such characters would be that there OP, or fanservicey, they do the job for being entertaining.\\n\r\n3/10 \u2013  Simple, but effortless storytelling.\\n\r\n5/10 \u2013 Bright Animation, and thats all.\\n\r\n4/10 \u2013 Completely meh music\\n\r\n4/10 \u2013 As there is just a few things to look forward on enjoying for such a show.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 3.5/10 Nothing less, nothing more.",

            "content": "Mondaiji-tachi or \"Problem Children are coming from another world, aren't they?\", but for me, it's more like \"mary-sues/gary-stus are coming from another world\".\r\nBecause of the reviews I've read here in MAL, I first thought this anime's one great thing to watch. Thing is, although a lot of people watch this and even gave a rating of almost 8, I strongly believe it's all thanks to Kurousagi being the eyecandy. It's also thanks to Izayoi, being \"too strong\" and not the \"pussy\" kind of guy (aka. weak-willed character) that he is. There's actually a reason of why there are stories with characters in a weak orbeatable state.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I dropped this after ep.7, even if I was more than halfway-finished. A week later and I totally decide to just get over the 3 (+1 ova) remaining episodes. Hell I'll never go thru this kinda again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY = 4\\n\r\nI was going to rate it as 2, if it hadn't been for the latter episodes. Because without the latter ep, it's somewhat the kind of anime that excites kiddies [you know, lots of power here and there], story-wise that is, but with characters meant for ecchi-loving audiences as well as those who must have a bad case of chuunibyou's.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART = 7\\n\r\ngood art, decent fight scenes [by focusing on the fight scenes, and not the reason why they're fighting].\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 6\\n\r\njust as fair as it is. The opening song gives you the vibe that it's a great anime---a lot has said it but well, not for me. (Maybe I just like stories with depth. I say I got rid of my chuunibyou a very long time ago)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 2\\n\r\nTHIS part is where the horrid review comes. Characterization is just FLAT. So here's how:\\n\r\n\"FLAT\" characters are those kind of characters who don't change at all, from ep.1 to ep.10 (or beginning to end of any other story), they don't \"develop\", one way or another.\\n\r\nThe great character-types fall as either \"complex\" or \"dynamic\"; example of \"complex\" will be someone like Rika Furude from Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni; and \"dynamic\" I could say someone like Kira Yamato from Gundam Seed.\\n\r\nBeing a \"flat\" character means the character is passive throughout the plot. The plot is already pre-made, the writer knows how to get there and he/she just takes his/her character there.\\n\r\nIf you take Gundam Seed (or pretty much something like \"Harry Potter\"), the plot will get nowehere UNLESS the main characters choose or make a move. Their actions and decisions will settle how the plot goes---and that's what a good development of character/s is/are all about.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's more, with all the \"all-powerful\" character Izayoi, Asuka, and Yu, and even Kurousagi----EVERY character almost has their off-the-scales abilities and powers a.k.a. \"gifts\"---and here I can't help but conclude they're \"flat\" mary-sues and gary-stus. No development in character, they have every power they need for convenience of the 10 episodes, no backup story as to why they have those [yes they acquired those thru godlike means or \"gifts\", but still why bother? Even Naruto have excuses for acquiring great ablities]. But the characters here, saying they're \"bored\" and acting all haughty after, well I guess Bella Swan do have her cousins.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, you might ask me why am I applying literature-standards in anime, but the thing is, I'm \"wasting\" or \"making worth\" my time in watching them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 2\\n\r\nI first dropped this after ep.7, but still did try to finish this 'til the end, for the sake of trying to justify and see what the 7.98 MAL rating is all about. \\n\r\nAnd yes, I'm gonna rate it here as \"flat\" as it is. Maybe I'm just not the guy who goes loving anime with all-around powers with main characters who can beat bad guys easily. I mean that's some Power-Rangers work---even Kamen Riders and Ultraman do get defeated---hell, even Superman does get defeated, and to think Superman is considered a \"gary stu\".\\n\r\nPS: I watched the OVA, didn't enjoy the ecchi fanservice also.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 4\\n\r\nThis is just flat. Why I gave this a \"4\" was all thanks to the latter episodes, yes.\\n\r\nI could say after watching all 10-episodes of this anime, and the MAL rating is 50/50 trusted.\\n\r\nI reviewed the Haruhi Suzumiya, and did mention some of my past experiences with \"otakus\" in that review, and yes, they like their characters as overkill-powerful [well, not all of them but you get what I mean, we don't generalize \"otakus\" as this, there are \"reasonable\" otakus also]. So maybe those who duels monster-cards, talks endlessly about mangaVSanime, and those whom the force of chuunibyou is strong within them, and again those who relentlessly likes an all-powerful overkill characters for an easy-beating bad guys and the convenience of the story, this kind of anime is for them.\\n\r\nLike fanservice? yep, check this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBUT \\n\r\nfor those who know some characterizations and plots, and watches anime because of the elements concerned, then I highly recommend other stuffs instead [Gurren Lagann, Steins;Gate, Noragami, C the Soul, FMA, SnK, etc]---you guys can live without this anime. Watching this anime is like watching Bella Swan being able to kick-ass some mythical monsters.",

It's very easy to follow and that makes it fun to watch. \r\nThe characters were good. I liked that the main character wasn't your typical whiny weak guy, but an absolute badass! I mean he was just awesome! I wish the story focused on some of the other characters as well, apart from the main ones though.\r\nOverall I give this anime a 8. An easy to follow story, with nice art and good characters. Definitely recommend to... everyone.I think everyone would love it, really.",

This world has its own rules that might be a bit confusing at times, but each community has what are called gifts~  These gifts are fought over in 'gift games'.  \r\nThe story is centered around an impoverished community with no name or flag.  They call upon three individuals (the main characters) to assist them in the gift games so they may become a secure, respectable communitythat won't easily be stepped on by other asshole communities.  I guess everything great starts small!  \\n\\n\r\nThe thing that stands out the most to ME is how the main characters are all confident in their own powers.  There is a doubter at one moment, but that's remedied in no time!  The gifts they possess are all extremely over powered and I love it.  \\n\\n\r\nAs with every anime these days, it does have its ecchi elements; mainly Shirokami and Izayoi messing with Black Rabbit.  However, the ecchi was kept to a surprising minimum~  Not too much, but not ignored!\\n\\n\r\nNext topic of interest is the artwork!  Not only are the characters all unique, but each scene comes with a set of vibrant colors.  Check out the stained glass and sunsets later on- they're dazzling!  ^^\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give this anime a 9!  I fully enjoyed the adventure and want nothing more than for it to continue!  The ending theme made me laugh out loud- it's an adorable chibi skit!  Please watch this anime; you'll regret nothing~",

            "content": "This has been the surprise anime of the winter season for me. The synopsis sounded pretty much like your average shounen, and with three girls on the cover of the page, it seemed like this show would just be laden with fan service, but in reality, the show has proven to be much more interesting than it comes off at first. And before I get started, I'd just like to say this is my first review, so any critique/criticisms are welcome.\r\nStory 7/10: The story opens up very shounen-esque. You have your three main characters, all with some special ability, contacted by a group of peopleto help them grow stronger as a community/guild. The three main characters fight  to get the community back up and running again and also defend it from people who would wish to do their community harm. The nice twist on the story is that the characters have to participate in \"gift-games\" or competitions with other communities to help make their own community stronger. The fights never drag on for too long and developments between opposing factions and characters always make you want to watch the next episode right away.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: The art is very clean and crisp, and is very nice to look at overall. The character designs are probably the best part of the artwork, as they are never dull or boring to look at. Although I do not consider 7 a bad rating, this show brings nothing new to the table in terms of artwork, which is why it fails to score higher. At best, it is on par with the other anime airing this season, which is not a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10: The sound is probably the weakest part of this anime. The soundtrack during battles is uninspired and you can pretty much forget that it's playing in the background because it's nothing that you haven't heard before. You will probably watch the ED more for the cute visuals than the actual song, but I will say that the OP is a very catchy pop song that fits the shows light hearted mood perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharecters 9/10: This is where the show shines. You aren't going to get a lot of character development or deep background story for the characters or anything like that, but the bottom line is that these characters are fun to watch. You have your male lead Izayoi who is so OP he can defeat any monster/opponent he comes across, which might seem boring at first because he never has a challenge, but this is actually part of his character. His over powerdness adds to his confidence and aggressive personality and because of this he is the most interesting character of the show. Then you have your aristocratic/rich girl Asuka who surprisingly is not an overbearing tsundere who acts like she's entitled to everything. She can be cute and funny which is a refreshing change of pace when dealing with this type of character. You also have the animal lover Kasugabe who seemed like she was going to be the most bland character of the show because of her lack of script early on, but eventually after several episodes and battles the writers have given her more lines, so she is also turning out to be a decent main heroine. Finally, you have probably everyone's favorite character, Black Rabbit. You will probably love or hate the show based off of Black Rabbit since she's one of the main attractions, if not the main attraction. Between her fanservice, ditzyness, and wonderful character design, she's just a big furry ball of moe thrown at the viewers. If you don't like moe, her airheadedness will probably make you cringe, but on the other hand, if you're a teenage male, you're, well you're probably gonna fucking love her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10: As of episode 7, I have been greatly enjoying this show. If you take this show for what it is and turn you're brain off, you're gonna have some mindless fun watching the pretty visuals and quirky characters interact with each other. The fanservice is obvious, but not overbearing. If you're looking for something more serious or deep plot/character development, you won't find it here. Needless to say, this is one of those shows that should deserve a second season once more of its light novels get finished.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: If you ask for my unbiased opinion, this show doesn't really deserve more than a 7, it might even deserve a 6. The characters aren't deep, and the plot isn't anything we haven't seen, but you see, I'm human, so I am biased. This show has been fun to watch. It reeled me in and it kept me coming back. Despite its flaws it still proved to be entertaining, and I rate my shows based off of how much I enjoyed it, so Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? gets an 8 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nI had fun writing this, and if I convinced at least one person to consider watching this then I call that a success. Once again critique/criticism/friendly disagreements are all welcome! I'll definitely update this once the series finishes! Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "Hi everybody, I guess this is my first time writing a review so I hope It wont take toomuch to understand what I want to say. Let's split the score as it's always done:\r\n__STORY__    8\r\nThe story its not the best point of this anime, but its not bad at all. It deals with three teenagers who have special powers and are really troublesome, who lived in different places and ages, and are summoned to an amazing world. There, they will have to defend a fallen community in order to achieve theirs objectives. From that point, there is a line like story, evenif it doesnt feel like a storyline, its not episodic at all, similar to SAO (Little arcs that together seems like an advance to the story). The story is really simple, there are not, almost great developments to the character attitudes; but what its interesting maybe is the world like background created for the story (The mixture with myths, legends and all that stuff).\\n\\n\\n\r\n__ART__ 9\\n\\n\r\nThis was amazing, the character desings were really interesting, from the MC and Heroines, to the Bad Guys, they all feel like a new own style from the anime. There are other animes like feel similar, but this one is really cool. I like to focus on the movements because they were amazing the action sequences were alike, you could feel the strength of every hit and even the speed of every step. The paisages were the most amazing thing of the art, from the city design to the nature design or even the inside of the buildings, they were all worthy of mentioning.\\n\\n\r\n__SOUND__9\\n\\n\r\nEven if I wasnt very fond of the opening soundtrack, I must admit that the sound cant envy other good animes. The seiyuus really did their job, some sad sequences, to some happy sequences. All the voice acting seemed really realistic for me, and of course the \"combat\" and \"chill out\" sound were also amazing.\\n\\n\\n\r\n__CHARACTER__9\\n\\n\r\nThis was maybe the best thing, for god's sake. Arent you tired of the clumsy MC? The guy who forgot his guts in his mom's house? You aren't going to get any of these in this anime, neither the typical badass who is afraid to be \"sexual active\" or the typical cold badass. This anime in some aspects were quite steorotypical, but in the characters, I guess there was quite innovation. The heroines of course were really interesting, but they didnt reach MC level. There are other characters quite interesting, like Shiroyasha or the Letizia, but, even the bad guys have a little of personality (I mean this is a shonen you cant expect the seinen complex level of personality, but it wasnt bad for a shonen). The only thing that avoids a score of 10 in this apart, is the development, it was too short for a real development, if they put another season on the factory I guess they'll focus a little more on this.\\n\\n\r\n__ENJOYMENT__9\\n\\n\r\nI'm not very fond of typical shonen, and this one has some treats of them, so I wondered why I had so much fun when I finished it. My conclusions are really simple, because even if you are not looking for these, even if you are more on the seinen thing, or the shojo thing or the josei thing, I bet that if you watch this anime, you wont regret it. I'm kinda tired othe typical shonen that I wont try because, God damn, it has like 1023012041204012 episodes, and everybody has told you the end. So even if you are not in this kinda shonen staff, you'll be interested at least in try it. This is not a masterpiece, this is not for example LoGH, GTO, or any of the great masterpieces recognize by everyone, and it wont pass to the history, but, definitely, It's worthy of the 240 minutes that you'll use to see it. \\n\\n\r\n__OVERALL__9\\n\\n\r\nThis point is just to clarify something, why if I think of it as amazing and the art was good, the story alike, the sound too and the characters even better, this is not a 10. Mainly, because a personal opinion, and thats: A shonen with a romance background cant be a masterpiece. This was, from my point of view, the lack of this anime, the failure. I know this goal is to get to the teenagers, with action fantasy and all that stuff. But If it had romance, this anime could really have been a masterpiece, but god knows if there will be another season, and maybe if the producer will then put some romance on it. I'll be hoping for it.",

            "content": "A guy that can beat Gods with his bare hands. A girl who can talk to animals and gain whatever ability they have. Another girl that can make people, animals and objects do whatever she commands. And a bunny-girl whose hair can turn from blue to pink, is really fast and wields a lightning spear.\r\nNow that's a pretty odd cast there, now isn't it? But all these characters are unique and each of them have their own reason of liking them. \r\nMondaiji-Tachi ga Isekai kara kuru sou desu yo? Is probably one of my favorite anime and one of the best one I've watched sofar. I was disappointed to know that it only had 10 episodes. But I'm confident it'll have a second season. \\n\\n\r\nThree kids who have supernatural powers, who are bored of the regular world are sent to another world to rebuild a broken community. The plot itself is pretty simple and straightforward. But the events that do occur while the story progresses more than make up for it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very diverse. Ranging from loli vampires to God-destroying teenagers. That's what also makes the anime enjoyable. Each has their own unique trait, despite the others being background or supporting characters. Izayaoi, though, reminds me a lot of Kazuto Kirigaya/Kirito from Sword Art Online. \\n\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nCool and often times fight without difficulty. Overpowered compared to others. Such a badass. But Izayaoi also reminds me of Izaya from Durarara! \"Entertain me!\" They both said. \\n\\n\r\nI was impressed on how the developers incorporated Japanese, Greek/Roman, Hindu and many other mythology into the story. Another result in the diversity of the anime, which is always a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes are epic. That's all I can say about that, other than Izayaoi being a total overpowered badass on the field. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are very well done. Bright and smooth, respectively. And there were no signs of animation/art value dropping at any part of the anime. And the voice acting was also quite good. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP didn't get through me. But the ending was so cute and aforable that I couldn't possibly miss out on it (You'll find out why once you see) \\n\\n\r\nComedy and Action. Plus, a little bit of fanservice by Black Rabbit. One of the best anime released in winter 2012-2013. Excellent art and animation. And the battle scenes are done wonderfully. I highly recommend this anime.",

            "content": "I first saw this series a year ago from the time I am writing this review. I read the title in English and the first thought that hit me was the main protagonist and his friends save loli-children from another world that appeared in his world and a loli-harem begins. That thought scared me off before I could read what it was actually about. After stumbling upon this on Crunchyroll a year later and actually reading the preview I decided to give this a try. And man was my first thought way off. Now after that little backstory let's get this review of \"Mondaiji-tachi gaIsekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\" under way. (Also there might be some minor spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nStory-8\\n\r\nThe overall story is our protagonist Sakamaki Izayoi and two heroines Kasukabe Yuu and Kudou Asuka is transported to a world where basically everything is decided by games. Izayoi and the two heroines meets Kurousagi (Black Rabbit). \\n\\n\r\n*minor spoiler alert*\\n\\n\r\n Kurousagi tells them she summoned them, and why she summoned them, to the world of games called Little Garden, and explains to them the rules of this world and she also tells them they each have a unique \"Gift\". These \"Gifts\" are just superhuman powers and they can also be rare/powerful items. They agree to her reasons of why she summoned them here and join her in the world of games, and so the adventure beings. The series is broken into several arcs each one with a villain and a reason why they fight the villain, e.t.c, e.t.c. Not going to go into any more detail about that, it will take way too long. In the story there are some plot holes that are not mentioned, like \"What happens in the world where Izayoi came from because he was teleported out of it.\" But there are no serious plot holes that stops you from enjoying the show. And for those that have not watched the series and is questioning the plot hole I just mentioned, you will understand why it is not a big issue if you watch the series. The arcs are very well done, each arc ending is tied with a pretty bow no loose ends come to mind while I am writing this review. If I did miss anything, I can't really do anything, so sorry. The one problem that comes to mind with the story is that it is way too short. For a 10-episode they packed a lot into it and leaves the ending for more. So I vote for a second season, even though it probably will not be happening anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nWhen I judge art for animes, I divide it into two sections. The Art and The Animation. In \"The Art\" section I will review how well the characters are drawn, how well I think they are colored and how well drawn the background and scenery and stuff like that is drawn/looks. In \"The Animation\" section I will review how well the anime was animated, the CG and stuff, and the choreography for action scenes (if there are any). I am not going to assign values to each section but from the general art score you can probably guess what it will be. Moving on!\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: The characters are really well drawn. They look the same through scene shifts and close-ups, their eyes don't look out of proportion in any scene, they don't have disappearing noses *cough*cough* mahou sensou *cough*cough*. The scenery is incredible. It looks very realistic as in the drawing looks like the real thing but you can tell it's a drawing. I will be honest, I am not good at reviewing any sort of art. So yeah, I'm sorry, but I will try my best. The scenery stuff doesn't look like the art staff photoshopped a tree and animated in a thousand times to make a forest, the scenery does look hand drawn or at least drawn on those drawing programs you use tablets for. Whatever. I hope you get the point. Again, I am a terrible art reviewer and this review is also probably not that great, but whatever. Moving on!\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation: The animation for this series is great. The bright colors are animated well so they stand out more on screen. The animation for the scenery is incredible. If you want a good explanation of the animation, just go watch the series. I hope you'll know what I mean if you do. Next. The choreography for the action series is done fabulously. Nothing seems off or anything. The Cg was great except for the explosions. All the CG's looked great and above average to me, but the explosions seemed like the ones you see in DBZ. Not the best compared to the other CG's. If you want a better explanation, just go watch the series yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nThe music in this, I found, was average. People may agree with me some may not. The OP was good. It is my favorite  song in this series because it is catchy, upbeat and has a somewhat nostalgic tune at one point. The ED is not my favorite. No offense to anybody but I did not like the singer's voice in the ED. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying it is bad I am just saying I did not like it. The tune in the ED was forgettable to me, and didn't appeal to my taste in music. Again, not trying to say it was bad. The only good part of the ED I found about it was the animation that went along with it. Some may agree some may disagree, but it always brought a smile to my face to see Kurousagi get pumped to get everybody dancing again. If you have no idea what I am talking about, watch the ED. The battle music and all other background music was good. I can't say much about these because they either went so well with the scenery I did not notice or they did not really stand out or anything that made the music memorable. Either way I can't rate this part very high because I can't really remember the background music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\r\nThe characters, I believe, are the strongest and most weakest point of the series. Izayoi, Asuka and Yuu all break the main lead stereotypes. I will go into more detail individually later. And we have Kurousagi, the one main lead that doesn't break the stereotypes. Moving on to details.\\n\\n\r\nIzayoi is not the common protagonist. Which makes him super awesome! He is not a whiny highschool boy that believes that friendship will triumph and all that sh*t. Izayoi is a badass with power to match. *Spoiler Alert* Izayoi is so powerful he can throw rocks so hard that on contact with another object, an explosion (if contact with water) or crater (if contact with another solid object) will appear. Don't get him wrong, he is not a complete jerk. He believes in teamwork and that, but only when it is required. He knows that strength of the individuals he is surrounded by and knows that they can handle themselves fine, if the individuals keep their calm. Izayoi has is usually always calm and looks for a way to relieve his boredom when not planning something. Izayoi also has an intelligence that can make even the smartest Asian jealous. Able to solve complex problems and puzzles himself when his teammates can't. The problem though is that he gets little to no backstory. His solutions to problems are usually very rash and there is no thinking process shown when he is solves complex puzzles. What they do show when he solves complex puzzles is him appearing out of nowhere saying he solved the puzzle and gives a very very brief explanation of what he did, which complicated things even more for me because I had to stop and try to think about it, but to no avail. Regardless of those problems, Izayoi is a great character.\\n\\n\r\nAsuka is a female lead that is not absolutely useless! Thank god for that! Right now, I can focus on what she isn't  but I think it will be quicker to tell you what she is. Asuka is a girl heir to rich family and business. *Spoiler Alert* her \"Gift\" is that she can bend people's actions to what she says. She is seen in the series as a strong female lead that can fend for herself and gladly help and defend her friends when needed. She is confident in her power and is not afraid to use it. Her intelligence is not as great as Izayoi's but she is still incredibly smart. She helps pitch in ideas when needed, picks fights only  when she knows she can win, she is funny and you also get to see a little more of a childish side to her in the later parts of the series. After seeing terrible heroines in SAO, School Days, STB, Tokyo Ravens, e.t.c. She is a breath of fresh air that I really needed.\\n\\n\r\nYuu is a mysterious girl. She is relatively silent throughout the series. And isn't seen doing much. But what we do see is incredible. She has quite the way with animals, she can eat a ton and much more hidden talents. We do get some nice backstory on her and how she got her \"Gift\" but other than that there is nothing else. She is not useless, in fact she would rather take on some tasks by herself so that others won't get hurt. I can't say much else since there isn't much else to say. But she is a great character even if she doesn't do as much as the others.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we have my favorite Kurousagi.\\n\\n\r\nKurousagi is somewhat overprotective and very overreactive. She is voiced by one of my favorite voice actors: Iori Nomizu. (Don't judge we all have different opinions). Kurousagi is a moon rabbit of the Little Garden and also has the rank of an aristocrat within the Little Garden. She is a motherly figure to the other three main characters and to all her friends. She cares more about her friends than herself, *spoiler* even selling herself as a sex slave to regain one of her friends. But that just adds to her charm. Kurousagi is not the brightest thinker within the group, but makes up for it in flashy fanservice and attacks. I may be decribing her as useless but when she gets angry in the series, you don't want to mess with her, in fact she is probably the only one in the group that can fight Izayoi head on and have a chance of winning. We see what Kurousagi has been through before the other three main characters stepped into the Little Garden and what her dream is. Overall she is a loveable character because she gets flustered easlily when Izayoi or another character, Shiroyasha, teases her, she serves as great comic relief and I think she is the character with the most backstory within the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters are great, they are smart, strong and funny. But the series being only 10-episodes really cuts down on any character development and backstory. Which I think can be overlooked because A. You can only fit so much into 10-episodes and B. What we do see from the characters are great. We can see them using all their talents to help each other and they do not change who they are within the span of the series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed this series. It got me back in the mood for watching anime after a month or so because it had an interesting premise and characters. Plus the look of the anime is amazing. The jokes are a little cliche but what is an anime without its cliches? \\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nFor some final words outside of the review. Congrats on reading this far, I am sorry if I was beating around the bush at times, and if I did take up too much of your time. I honestly believed that my review was not going to be so long. So again, sorry for taking your time. This is my first review so that's why it is not that great. If you have some comments or hate, comment on my profile, feedback is appreciated. It makes me feel good that people have taken their time to read my opinions, and will help me improve my reviews if I do any more. Back to the review. This is definitely an enjoyable watch. I highly recommend it to any body that needs a lighthearted watch or needs something to get them back into anime. The characters are enjoyable, the art and animation are above average and the story leaves little room to question. The bad part is that this is only 10-episodes so there is not much character development or any room for backstory. The music is not so great either. And there are some plot holes that do pop up, but does not distract you from the overall stuff that goes on. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Given the number of cute girls, loli's, and a rabbit girl, you would expect a lot of perverted content, but this Anime is very tame and managed to keep their full clothing on 98% of the time. The story and journey are amazing, but 10 episodes are not even close to being enough to cover everything and given how much potential there was, there could have been so much more, easily 50+ eps worth. That is the only issue I found, which leads to a lot of content that never got a whole lot of depth and a story that seems somewhat rushed and unfinished,or possibly all the material in between that could have been done.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a very satisfying amount of action, it is what these games come down to, even though they could be kind of game. Aside from a brief, and another slightly longer hot springs scene, 1 image, and a couple pervert based jokes, there is none of that content surprisingly.  Something interesting is the inclusion of some mythology and fairy tail/history bits, so if you are into those, it makes the story quite a bit more appealing. If there is 1 positive thing to say about the rather short episode count, it's that it's never boring as something is always happening. It doesn't feel conclusive though, conclusive to 1 incident, yes, but for the Anime, no.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the key component here, and make it so enjoyable. They made the cast quite interesting, and there are several, all rather diverse. They did go pretty loli & female heavy, but given the action, their target audience is males, they keep their clothes on though, minus one scene. The costumes for the characters look great, and the coloring & design of the characters look good too. The special skills each character has is quite interesting, I didn't find anyone to be boring.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the colorful animation and colorful design of the characters. The opening was pretty epic, but the ending rather lame.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a great watch, even if it doesn't feel conclusive or finished. The characters combined with the story make it really entertaining, and there is plenty of action. It never feels boring and unfortunately, the Anime is over before you know it. The cast is female heavy, and loli heavy too, but at least they don't use them to sell the Anime as perverted material beyond a few brief moments and stick to keeping it tasteful, they could have easily gone the other route and sold it for the \"plot\".",

If you like badass lead, who doesnt like messing around, is OP and has also really strong sidekicks this is for you. All of them has nicely written personalities, are somewhat unique and it can be considered a small miracle regarding they hadonly 10 episodes to present them.\\n\\n\r\nSecond point is the fun and enjoyment. This anime is really relaxing, funny and easy to watch. You can turn off your brain and watch nicely animated fights with no big stress that main charters will get their ass kicked, followed by decent fan service provided by local bunny girl.\\n\\n\r\nLast point is the story. Although cliche as the anime can be, it has set on the other hand quite unique backstory and world which could be later delevoped in decent story (yes you can read the novel, but you know ... anime has moving pictures).\\n\r\nYes, I say could. Here lies your main reson why \"you SHOULD NOT\" watch this anime. And its when you dont like unfinished stories, opened ending etc.. Im not quite sure why this has only 10 episodes it so much wasted potencial I would cry.\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it, if you can overcome that its only 10 episodes long and although the one arc of the story is finished, main journey has only began just not in the anime, you will experience one of the most enjoyable OP main lead ever created in anime.",

            "content": "So Mondaiji is a story that follows 3 problem children from different places around the world. All of these kids have special powers that they are able to use. One day they receive a letter that comes out of no-where. They have no idea who sent the letter or how it got there, but the letter talks about needing their power, and this is where the story begins. \r\nAfter these events it follows how these children deal with the problems they face in the new world they were sent to, encountering many strange people/beings a long the way. It was a really enjoyable story, Iespecially liked the fact that all of the kids had very powerful abilities. Izayoi being the strongest one by far. You can't go wrong with a super powerful cocky main can you? :p\\n\\n\r\nI did feel that they could have done a lot more with this than just the 10 episodes, but the ending seemed to have more to be told, so hopefully that might be a sign for a possible second season! Now on to my specific review points.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nNow this may not be the most original story-line, but it did have many redeeming factors. In this world they can have a better life where they use their powers and want to stay. Also, they play things called gift games, which is a pretty interesting thing. It only has 10 episodes and 1 ova, which was kind of disappointing, but the way it ended seemed open, so maybe a season 2? c:\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was really well done. There was a lot of detail in the background images, which made for a really nice looking anime overall. The characters looked awesome as well, and the battle scenes were pretty nicely done. I really don't have any complaints on the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good, the battle scenes had some pretty nice effect sounds, which was nice to see. The voice actors seemed to match very well to each of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nThey did not go into the past of each main all that much. They described their situation to some extent during the time-frame right before they left their world, but they didn't go into their pasts or how they got their powers. Other than the fact they didn't give much back-story on any of the characters, I believe all the mains were all pretty likable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime for me was pretty much everything I love. A new world, Super Powerful Mains, different types of beings, and action! It was cool to see how they went on dealing with all of the conflicts in this new world. Also, I really loved the action scenes with Izayoi, he is just too badass. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of action this is definitely a must watch. It has a pretty cool story behind it as well. I wish they would have added more episodes, but it was still a great anime. I'm just hoping for a season 2. Non-the-less, this is one of my favorite anime, if you like action and powerful main characters, this a great anime for you!",

            "content": "Yuuup!So, I just finish watching this 10 episode anime, so fair I just gave most of the categories a number 6 as in fair enough in most parts. Frankly, I see it as another fantasy adventure anime which the characters, in thios case 3 brats with special abilities were taken from another world to fight for the cause of the weaker group which represents the so called \"No Names\" as usual but with a little twist on the sides, since the plot has that parody element taken from the children's fairly tale \"The Piped Piper\" with a darker side into it...... I guess studio Diomedeawas focusing on the fantasy part of this anime and I give credit for them to just limit it to 10 episode. I guess on the realistic side the director Yasutaka Yamamoto was pretty much aware that they can only rely on the fantasy and action genre so much that it's not worth extending it up to 12 or 13 episodes, bueno, Aqu\u00ed est\u00e1n mis posiciones para este anime:\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory-Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was too simple and did rely on some dark children's fairly tale, but the plot depended heavily on the 3 brats who were bored and were itching for some excitement  in which they got.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Art-Fair 6. \\n\\n\r\nIt is not bad, but not that good either since I was hoping to see what color panty was Kurousagi wearing.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Sound-Fair 6. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWell I did like Kurouasgi's cutsy voice and Izayoi tough guy tone,but the turn off was the ending theme. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-Fair 6\\n\\n\\n\r\n I really like the fact that the main protagonist did sided with the weaker group, but Kurousagi's role was for me was a double standard, though she did summon the 3 brats to  aide the \"No Names\" her role seem to conflict the side where she belongs, if she is somewhat of a moderator then she should be a neutral entity and have no connection of whatsoever with the 'No Names,\" therefore she should have punish Galdo Gasper for causing chaos in episode 2, also she should have also have the authority to regulate the Gift Game that occurs between the protagonist and the antagonist in this anime, frankly her role was pretty much chaotic, which she claims to be with the \"No Names\" and yet she doesn't make any effort to protect her own side, in fact she even lacks leadership skills.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-Fair 6.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell lets just say the though it was enjoyable to see the 3 brats kick the antagonists' ass, it was this bunny's chaotic role that limits its category to a 6.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nBecause, studio Diomedea was realistic enough that to limit the anime to just 10 epsiode and not adding additional filler episodes.\\n",

This plot is full of convenience and there is no tension.\r\nThe art was fantastic and the sound was good. I gave it equally a 6. However, I find that the main character Izayoi was too overpowered and the rest of the cast are like useless and they do not have the chance to be powerful. The main character Izayoi always gets the job done.\r\nWhat I want to see in an action anime is everyone have equal strength and their depth of power. Eg.Yozakura Quartet, Shakugan no Shana. To me, characters who are too perfect are too painful to watch because there will be no character development like Sword Art Online, Kaze no Stigma.  \\n\\n\r\nEven worse is Izayoi's arrogance which really enrages me. I dropped this anime because I find it too predictable that he will save the day in the end and not to mention his attitude. I won't bother watching it again. Even some cases like Kirito from SAO, Kazuma & Ayano from Kaze no Stigma.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, every hero is unique in so many ways. Nobody is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThere is actually no character development at all and I will not watch another season of this anime. Even if other characters besides Izayoi save the day, I do not feel any tension in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI really dislike it if they always pull KuroUsagi's ears all the time. It bugs me so much. If you like this show, good for you. This is my opinion so please respect me. Thank you very much.",

            "content": "\"Mondaiji defines a new standard for wish fulfillment\" is my first thought after watching this anime.\r\nIn fact, it is a haphazard mixture of cliched trademark elements of modern anime that draws so much criticism and at the same time are basically \"what sells\". To elaborate, perhaps the most well-known/notorious anime where this formula was taken, perfected, and executed is Sword Art Online. \r\nNow let's talk about Mondaiji, while keeping that in mind. Overpowered main character. Check. Bright fantasy world. Check. Loli. Check. Moe. Check. Tsundere. Check. Sexy bunny girl. Check. Cute pet. Check. Bishounen. Check.\r\nAnd yet at this juncture I must remind everyone that manyof the best things in this world are, in fact, made out of the most common/cliched ingredients. The beauty lies in how each part is assembled to create something wonderful. Indeed, in Mondaiji I see a (near) perfect example of this. At no place was I not amused and entertained by the witty back-and-forth between the main characters and the occasional fan-service. The fantasy world is well-constructed and so blatant in its over-the-top-ness that I would think, \"Well, we're talking about Little Garden after all. Anything is possible I guess\", whenever seeing something extraordinary. The characters by themselves are nothing too spectacular; in fact, you could probably name for each of them any number of similar characters in other anime. And yet they fit perfectly into the story and I never got tired of, or annoyed by them. Of course I must not forget to mention the main male protagonist, Izayoi Sakamaki, who manages to be bad-ass, clever, perverted, funny, and chill all at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a great adventure, look no further. This short 10 episodes well take you on a journey you will never regret. Yet if you are looking for something dark, meaningful, romantic, depressing(I can never understand why people like to watch shows which end up in nothing but a bucket of tears), erm you are probably at the wrong place.\\n\\n\r\nSome food for thought inspired by Mondaiji(and other well-known shows, ahem Superman): If ever you had abilities/talent that put you above everyone else, what would you do? Would you try to 'save the world'? Would you pretend like you never had powers and live out a normal life? Will you journey around the world and end up bored because you have seen everything there is to see? Hm..\\n",

            "content": "\"I can't believe this.\"\r\nProblem Children is one of those back pocket anime's. All of the factors that make a fantastic show have come together, the stars and planets have aligned perfectly, and in their wake, my favorite anime of all time was contrived. This show is poles apart from other anime of it's time. I legitimately tried to find one thing i disliked about this show, and i came up with nothing. Problem Children is literally  absolutely ideal.\r\nThe show is basically about a group of literally bad-ass kids that are summoned to a new world, where games reign supreme. The games in this showare so well thought out, that i can not even compare it to No Game No Life. The games and lead characters are much more developed then say, Sora or Shiro, who are left completely bland in a world with so much potential. With a strong supporting cast featuring Jack O Lantern, Mikenoko the cat, and DEEEEAAAANNN, enjoyers of No Game No Life will find this show to be far superior in every way possible. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story, oh boy where do i begin. The plot in Problem Children is completely fleshed out, leaving nothing to be desired by the viewer. The flow is seamless, there is never a part of the plot that moves too quickly, and all of the fabulous twists and turns stay true to the plot and the world. The three main characters, You, Izayoi, and Asuka are summoned to a new world by a mysterious and attractive girl named Black Bunny. Upon arrival, they must band together in various ways to form a community that can stand on its own two feet. \\n\\n\r\nGames 12/10\\n\\n\r\nThe game aspect is where this show truly shines, although please bear in mind that all aspects shine, i just had to pick one point to \"rule them all\" (lol). The games range from card games with intense strategic decisions, to battles against literal gods, to griffon races with more then just their lives on the line, their pride will also be on the line! I don't want to spoil any of the games from this anime, but trust me, this is some of the best gaming related anime content available on the web. \\n\\n\r\nArt 11/10\\n\\n\r\nOk, I have a good story to tell for this one. First off, the art is out of this world (literally, they are in a different world). The characters and designs are astounding, and characters such as Mikenoko, Dean, and Black Bunny will have designs, graphics, and effects that you have never seen before. So i have this friend who is a pretty good artists, and i told her to draw some of these Problem Children characters for fan-art.  Long story short, the art in this anime was on such a high level, that my artist friend didn't even have the skill level required to drawn them! That is just crazy and mind blowing because she draws pretty good Dragonball Z and Bleach, and Naruto. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music, good god the music is bliss to my ears. I have an ipod soundtrack dedicated to all the songs from this anime. I convinced my bowling league to play these songs on repeat for league nights, and the other bowlers love it. It works great to play games to this gaming anime sound track. Basically, any game lover will love to play games to these music tracks. I know i sure do! \\n\\n\r\nThe voices are another part that just adds to this anime greatness. Black Bunny, along with the entire cast have fantastic voice overs. I would put these voice overs on par or better then Dog Days. (which is fan-effing-tastic)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 11.2/10\\n\\n\r\nat least 7 of my top 10 favorite characters come from this anime. The characters are brilliant, and developed so well you might actually think some are really real. the conversations and humor work so well together, that this is the best and most funniest made show possible.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 88/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you couldnt tell allready, this show is EM-EH-ZING. The 4 hours that this show brought to me were possibly the best four hours of my life, not counting my trip to Florida last year. I would say any one that rated No Game No Life a 3 or higher will probably give this show a 10. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA perfect anime. Many say that such a thing is impossible to create, but this anime has gone and proooved everyone wrong. the fact tat only 50k people have watched this is a shame to us all. This anime should be regarded as THE anime to watch, and the anime to bring new viewers in, like death note or Dragon Ball Z are now. Ive shown this show to 12 other people, and everyone of them agrees that this is amaizng. Words are not good enough to describe this show, so the only thing left to do is to get off your butt, sit down, and watch this anime",

            "content": "I'll start off my review by saying that Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? is a nice power fantasy anime. I know there is a light novel series out there with the same title, which the anime is based, but I have never read it and will base my review on the show itself entirely.\r\nStory: The story starts off with three teenagers from different parallell worlds, in different time lines, with each their own special, superhuman ability. They all get the same letter, inviting and summoning them to the lands of Little Garden, a land between worlds where people survive through Gift Games,a kind of challenge with rewards decided upon beforehand. The land of Little Garden is inhabited by all kinds of species which ranges between creatures such as animals, animal-human hybrids, angels, demons, monsters, gods, humans etc. The three teenagers (Izayoi, Yoh and Asuka) are recruited into a community (a kind of small group/nation) to help restore it. The story isn't complicated and it doesn't need to be. It contain exiting power fantasy battles, some scheming and riddles, and problem solving. The characters all have their own unique personality that kind of fits their special ability, like how Asuka (a priviliged high born lady) has the ability to force her commands on other people or objects, but could use a little more back story. The weakness of the plot is how short the series is, with only 10 episodes and 1 OVA episode, which doesn't give enough time to properly explain the setting and the characters. From what I've read the light novel series it's based on should contain enough story for well more than 30 episodes. Still, it's an enjoyable and simple series.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The art in this show is astounding, with great detail to the environments as well as the characters, adding vibrant colors and dark hues when needed. The character designs are all nice to watch and the movements of the the characters and the landscapes (water, clouds, etc.) are all well done. The sound and voice acting is quite superb, but has some drops in quality from time to time (especially when a character is howling or roaring).\\n\r\nOverall: I thoroughly enjoyed this show, reveling in the action and comedy, but wish there was more. Unfortunately it doesn't seem like there will be adapted any more, with nothing added since I first saw it several years ago. Still, I think many people can find a lot of enjoyment in what little part of it we were given.\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

The mixing of genres is done really well and each one is covered nicely.\r\nThough it's cliche, the main characters are over powered. They're dealing with adult problems but there's immaturity mixed in which makes it flow. \r\nIf you're a fan of pervertedcharacters, you'll like Izayoi. His character is done really well, but so are the others. The characters are a big part of an anime and these ones are good. They're individuals, you can tell their different personalities with very minimal background information, and there's a character for the different sorts people enjoy. Egotistical pervert? Yep. Big boobs? Of course. Loli? You bet. \\n\\n\r\nI thought it would lead to a different ending, but it was still good and a fitting ending. It's definitely worth watching. \\n\r\nHere's hoping it gets a sequel!",

            "content": "Problem Children From Another World Are Coming, Aren't They? is an enjoyable anime that's surprisingly short, despite it's long title. Speaking of, I really do have to gripe about these ridiculous titles that Japanese conceive. Seriously, why are all of their recent titles so freaking long? These aren't even titles anymore, they're entire sentences!\r\nStory: The story itself starts off kind of cliched. Children from another world are basically summoned by a chick with bunny ears to participate in what's known as Gift Games within a world called Little Garden. While the premise is pretty stereotypical, I like how they were actually summoned for a reason- even if helping a community that's barely keeping itself together is, in itself, a cliche. While I've seen this done plenty of times, I will admit that I have seen pretty much everything there is to see out of the entertainment industry, so watching a story get re-ashed in this manner doesn't really bother me all that much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters themselves are interesting, but some of them are kind of bland at the same time. It's hard to explain. I genuinely like the characters in it, but I can see the archetypes they're made from. Izayoi is your typical bad boy who's gotten bored with life and wants to have fun, Asuka is a rich girl who's gotten bored with life and wants to free, You (Yes, that is her name) is a lonely girl who's gotten bored with her life and wants to make friends, and Black Rabbit is your typical fanservice girl complete with big breasts and bunny ears. These aren't really \"deep\" characters, when you think about it. In fact, they seem fairly one-dimensional at times. However, I think there's charm in the simplicity of these characters. While none of them will win any \"Character of the Year\" awards, I enjoyed watching the chaos they caused and laughed during some of the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: While this isn't something that I'm big on, I can say that the sound quality was nice. There wasn't anything overtly wrong with it, and both the subbed and dubbed version had some decent voice acting. I actually liked some of the dubbed actors better than the subbed ones in this. I don't know the name of the guy who played Izayoi, but he really is a good VO. While some people sound like they're just reading lines from a script, his voice actually has emotion in it, which is important in voice acting and something that a lot of anime voice actors seem to fail at.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork here is nice, but uninspired. Having only been created within the last five years or so, this is a relatively new anime, and it generally follows an art style that is similar to most other new anime out there. The characters are vibrant and colorful, the backgrounds are well-drawn and contrast nicely with the characters, and the designs are fairly nice. However, while the artwork isn't bad, there is nothing here that makes it stand out from the other anime I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nAnimations: While the animation is smooth and fluid, there is only so much \"I'm so cool look at how my air rustles in the wind\" that I can stand. One thing this anime has a lot of is Hair Rustling. You've probably seen this before, even if you haven't heard of it. This is when a strong wind kicks up around the main character, whose hair suddenly waves about fiercely while Mr. or Ms. MC smirks a smug little smirk. There is a lot of that here, and it got kind of annoying at times. Despite my complaint, the animation is still nice and all of the characters were on model during the action sequences, which is more than I can say for some anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn a whole, I think this anime was interesting. If they ever came up with a second season, then I would probably watch it. I may even watch season 1 again if the mood takes me. However, while I enjoyed the anime personally, I can also unequivocally state that this anime is not without its flaws.",

I really enjoyed this series I think it was one of the best anime to come out in 2012. So if you like comedy and action I highly recommend yougive this series a try, as it has the perfect balance of both. The only complaint I have is that it is only 10 episodes long, and it seems like the studio kind of rushed it a little. I think they could have made it 24 episodes or longer, I really hope their will be a season 2.",

In this case, they have chosen Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? (Mondaiji in short) to be the filler role, well how unexpected, this series really can develop a lot better.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThis anime is a adaption of a Light Novel with the same name. The story is set in a alternativeworld known as \"box\", in this world, everyone from different world or different time line gather up and play a game with their gift being the chip. Gifts can be various of powers, talent, identity, and status. Many of the legends and heroes gather up, and their levels are set in various of gifts, the more known and strong gift owners are given the title Maou (Demon Lord) in different flour levels.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art used in this anime is unfortunate not very good, there are many repeated actions and several times the art crashes and breaks down. Well, because this anime isn't produced very well, and it lack on funds, which really can't be blamed because this anime is only 10 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nDespite of the low quality art they used, the music track they used is quite good regarding on its low founding, but there are many repeated music uses and most of the tracks are only focused in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime is really well described, and mostly important its lovable. Most of the Shounen anime must have few really bitching females and as always a retarded leading protagonist, in this case, Izayoi, our leading protagonist is very not retarded, and his harem team is not very annoying as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis story line is very wide and really interesting even though it's only 10 episodes, its still very enjoyable though out the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis series really suppressed me. Firstly i thought this series is just going to be another mindless Harem or Ecchi anime, oh how wrong was I orz. This series is recommended to all those who are really into fantasy and magic settings, I can guarantee you will not be disappointed.",

Like only one scene in the start.\r\nExcept of that there's like one more scene, but it's more of a commedy Ecchi. You'll  laugh atleast ;)\r\nAh you'll understand once you watch it.

I personally found the end very bad for some reason, in fact, i found the second half of the anime bad. I loved the character too, it basically is the reason i watch the show in the first place. The sound, the visuals and the story were pretty good. I had a great time watching the anime. It could have change some little things here and there to make it better because it was very very very predictable. Compare to other anime ive watch in 2015, it was oneof the best, at least one of the one i had a lot of fun watching.",

            "content": "Oh boy its Kastelle reviewing more outdated anime.\r\nWhatever, I just like to reminisce over my past life and thin of the times that I don't want to neck myself with a noose. (Editor's note : More suicide jokes! What an edgy guy!)\r\nTL;DR = As a person who's living in the 2017 and realizes this is a 2013 anime, I feel this anime is one of the best Isekai anime. Very good art for 2014, Sound was crafted well and captures the essence of the scenes, story was forgettable but last bit was fun. And I thoroughly enjoyed it. And... Season 2 when?\r\nMondaiji-tachi ga  ISEKAIkara kuru sou desu yo... is a mouthful of a title so lets shorten that into Mondaiji instead. Mondaiji is probably one of the founding fathers of the Isekai genre in the world of Anime but we all know who the real founding father is... (sword art online) But I digress. This anime spawns from the wave of demands of the Isekai genre after Sword Art Online finished airing (or turns to crap). \\n\\n\r\nAnyways on to my review:\\n\\n\r\n===Story===\\n\r\nProgression : 9\\n\r\nStorytelling : 7\\n\r\nStory uniqueness : 5\\n\\n\r\nIf SAO has a memorable but bad story progression. This anime suffers from good story but it is easily forgettable. I mean I still remember everything though because I have a good memory of everything except for School and Studies (apparently).  A gary stu is brought into another world because of his powers, because he is a gary stu, he tries to fight against the \"evil\" by abusing his powers. Sounds familiar? (No game No Life, Sword Art Online, and basically nearly all isekai genre) Oh man... I thought we're done with this. But what makes the story memorable though however is the uniqueness of the things that is happening in the anime. Such as the final arc of the anime. To be honest story is not the strongest suit of this anime so lets skip to the art section because there's not much for me to talk about here aside from it being the typical isekai anime.\\n\\n\r\n===Art===\\n\r\nArtstyle : 8\\n\r\nAnimation: 9\\n\\n\r\nAhhh Diomedea, the studio that creates mediocre anime because of their mediocre stories. But to tell the truth, the animation and artstyle is really good for a 2013 anime. And then... there's the 2017 Sho-bitch...... but that's for another time.\\n\r\nJudging the anime studio aside, yeah, the animation is really good, fight scenes were coherent and everything is animated beautifully. I just need to wait a thousand years more to get the season 2 of this anime to get animated so I can see more of Izayoi's bullshit powers in action.\\n\\n\r\n===Sound===\\n\r\nMusic : 8\\n\r\nVoice Acting : 7/8\\n\r\nSound FX : 7\\n\\n\r\nSound effects are... somewhat ok... but I don't like it. Somebody may appreciate the sound effects but I think its just ok. Not good but ok.\\n\r\nMusic is interesting. at least for the music within the anime itself. Opening doesnt really fit the theme of the anime. At least that's how I view this. But... ED... Always has a spot in my heart.\\n\\n\r\n===Character===\\n\r\nOverall : 7\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the characters are all bland, lets talk about them one by one. To be honest the only ones that stands out is Izayoi, KuroUsagi, and Shiro Yasha for good reasons.\\n\\n\r\nIzayoi : Gary Stu in an Isekai world. Look at : Kirito, Sora, or any oher kind of OP isekai Protag\\n\\n\r\nKuroUsagi : Probably main \"Love\" (quote intentional for good reasons). It's basically a precursor of Aqua. A literal Clown of a guide.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I forgot the 2 of the main characters because their backstory is bland and uninteresting. Really poor character development for the 2 especially for the one with the Cat. Since the other girl does have some character development in the last arc of the series which is the last battle of the season.\\n\\n\r\nBut Shiro Yasha is quite memorable since she is quite unique in terms of character. Which I wont spoil here. But let me just say that she is one of my favorite characters and probably the only character that I find interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAntagonists wise, I find them actually way better than I expected. They're definitely well more defined than its direct competitor No Game No Life since the Antagonist there is kinda... tasteless.\\n\\n\r\n===Enjoyment===\\n\r\nOverall : 9\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly I enjoyed this anime though. Since because back then Isekai genre was actually relatively new and the animations are charming. For sure this is probably one of my favorite Isekai anime since the world of the game is well relatively good. Is this better than SAO? well I can't compared it since its not apple to apple, but I definitely enjoyed this more than SAO. But is this better than No Game No Life? the answer to that is No. No Game No Life somehow creates a something of an, definitely better than Mondaiji since they tackled : Character development and more defined characters and they have better characters... At least for the protagonists.\\n\\n\r\n===Genre Specials!===\\n\r\nIsekai : 9\\n\r\nComedy : 7\\n\r\nHarem : 10\\n\r\nFan-Service : N/A\\n\\n\r\nI must say that the genre specials here is pretty much good, all I can say that they nailed the genre specifics. The only gripe I have with this anime is that the comedy is basically always a jab. Sometimes it works otherwise it just leaves a pain in my mouth from cringing from the jabs. Fan Services does not applicable here except if you watch the OVA which is not applicable in this instance since I don't want to touch OVAs at all.\\n\\n\r\n===Overall===\\n\r\nTotal Score : 8\\n\\n\r\nMondaiji is a really good anime if you want some cheap laughs from Kuro Usagi's stupid decisions (Aqua of this anime) and if you want some cheap action sequences that you like to see. And basically this anime is the must watch for the most OP character in the anime history. As an avid reader of the Light novel, I would not recommend for those who already read the light novel because it is way better in terms of story. But I can say that this is a safe anime to pick up if you want some fun and action at the same time while not sacrificing too much time watching the 1 season (10 episodes). I enjoyed it, so most of you should too because its not cringy and there's no moe bait trash.\\n\\n\r\nAlso Season 2 when?",

Well here is my Review after I watched all of the episodes.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nThe story tells us about a teen with a problem of their own, and they're invited to Fantasy world to do some game. The theme is okay by me like that but the execution isn't. The story has a really Fast pace and it really feels rushed to the end. Theplot isn't that interesting either. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nAnime these day always give us a good art and mondaiji has it too, but the art aren't exceptional. Its just like typical anime these day. the character design is good but I always get the feel,\"This Chara looks like from that anime\" for some character. for the example is kurousagi, i've seen a lot of character that looks like her.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe Ep and ED is good, I think I liked the EP a lil bit and ED is so-so(I don't know for a cute anime loving) as the ED goes with the Chibi character dancing. The Voice character is good, nothing goes wrong.The Background music fit the scene too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nAll the character have superpower eventhough they're from the real world. one have the ability to make someone do as she tell to(Just like a geass that Lelouch from code geass has), one can talk to the animal and use their power, and the last one is unknown but has a god-like power. the reason I gave this character a 5 point is because the Unknown power of Izayoi, He's too overpowered. He can defeat a god at ease, and stop sword with just one finger, seriously WTF?!, on top of that He got a genius brain too. There are no significant development at other character too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nI can pretty much enjoy this anime despite the story that is rushed and the overpowered character. Maybe because I was busy watching a heavy anime and I was searching a light anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOveral 6/10\\n\r\nIf you're searching for light anime I problaby reccomend this one if you're okay with no explanation about the story or the characters.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Problem Children focused on three superpowered teens from different time periods who get whisked away to a parallel world where they have to assist a struggling land with reclaiming its status by competing in competitions against demon lords. For a 10-episode TV anime, this series does offer enough to engage its audience as the games that our leads have to contend with have a bit of variety to them outside of fighting such as one challenge where one of the leads have to ride a griffin and having to put some effort at thinking things out, as the series usually dabbles into elements of legendaryand mythical lore when our leads accept challenges in games. The teens in this series appear to be rather intelligent and competent when it comes to the use of their abilities, and several of the leads get enough fleshing out of their backgrounds and some character growth where you could care for them (including Black Rabbit). There is also a decent level of world building in the series to explore how the competitions in the series effect differing kingdoms and show the amount of risk that they have for the alternate world's residents and status.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does have its issues. The title's male lead Izayoi is rather underdeveloped compared to the other leads and doesn't go through the difficulties and developments that the girls underwent, making his character a bit shallow. The series also usually tosses in moments of fan service that are a waste of time, including its bonus OVA episode, and has an open ending as things with the No Names are still unresolved.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series sports gorgeous scenic shots of the parallel world in the series and decent-looking character designs with vivid color and a good amount of visual detail, though designs are a bit on the conventional side. Animation is modest with basic movements yet resorts to shortcuts during any action scenes to simulate fluid movement, especially in sequences that involve intense action such as Izayoi's use of his powers in action. The music does its part to complement key scenes with a mix of upbeat and comical insert tracks and use of J-pop songs, though nothing in particular greatly stuck out with the series for me with the music.\\n\\n\r\nGripes aside though, Problem Children is still a decent time-killer with characters that break the mold for a fantasy-adventure title and having some unique elements to the games that they have to confront. It's worth a look if you want a break from more conventional fare.",

Being super strong? Being able to talk to animals? Controlling people? If yes, This is the anime for you, This anime lets you see what will happen if you have your those power.\r\nNow, we'll focus on the main points now.\r\nMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? (Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They?) is a Comedy, Fantasy, Supernatural Anime. This anime has10 episode and 1 OVA.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nThe story is about 3 \"Problem Child\"getting an invite from the other world into\"Little Garden\",They meet Kurousagi, which is the girl that invited them to the world for them to help Kurousagi's Community, which is the \"No-Name\".I won't spoil much so you can go have fun watching it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThey where well drawn,I really liked the style of the art in this anime,The animations were good too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sounds were good aswell like the art.Nothing really to say much about the sound since,they were good.The Sound effects of Kurousagi jumping,The opening and the ending song were good aswell.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters really left their mark on me.The silent but cute Kasukabe,The dangerous and cool Izayou,The easily-teased Kurousagi and last but not least from the main is the beautiful and a little arrogant Asuka.Even the supporting roles made a mark on their own,Jin Russell,Shiroyasha,Leticea and the others too!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 \\n\r\nThey were really easy to enjoy even if it was so fast-paced and there were only 10 episode. I really laughed myself with the Shiroyasha and Izayou combination of pervertness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIt was really good overall. The story was fast-paced but IT was still good, The art was really good, The sound was really nice, The characters really left an impact and they gave me a laugh.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts:\\n\r\nThis anime really finished so fast and left so many things unanswered, I really wish they make a Season 2 of this anime.",

            "content": "No Game No Life.\r\nThat's the first thing I remember when I watched the beginning of this anime. And that's what keeps me going and watching this anime. \r\n*SLIGHTLY SPOILER ALERT*\r\nSTORY - 7\r\nI really like the concept of protagonists being bored in the real life and suddenly being sucked at another world. This really reminds me of No Game no Life. But unlike NGNL, the protagonists here possess supernatural powers. I expected more. Yeah. Since most of the reviews says that this anime is good and exciting. So it increases my expectation. But however, honestly, I get disappointed. \r\nFirst, What's the little garden? Where itcame from? MAybe the continuation is on the manga or light novel, but the fact is the series lacks information. \\n\\n\r\nSecond is, for me, this anime gets boring since the protagonists, mainly Izayoi is too overpowered. It's just getting tiring to watch something too perfect, isn't it? \\n\\n\r\nBut, at the last episodes of the series, I find it quite interesting since there is some riddle that needed to be solved, and slight effort shows on the protagonists side. \\n\\n\\n\r\nART - 8\\n\\n\r\nArt is good, yeah. \\n\r\nBut it somewhat lacking of emotions. \\n\r\nTo be honest, I don't really like moe moe characters, loli, chibi or what so I really didn't find the characters cool and cute. \\n\\n\r\nThe effects in fighting is great, though. \\n\r\nI don't really have a problem on the art except the characters figures. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\\n\r\nSound is great for me, I guess. \\n\r\nThe sound while fighting is fine with me. \\n\r\nThe opening and ending song too, I don't really have anything to say. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 7\\n\\n\r\nI don't really hate the character but I don't really like them either. \\n\r\nCharacter Development is missing in the series. And I don't see the characer grow at all since they are too perfect. Too perfect to be human. \\n\\n\r\nIzayoi, one of the protagonist, is overpowered. I don't know if he is made to be flawless. But really, is there any human who don't even get scared or shaken by something. It is just my opinion but it's like the anime is telling the watcher the entire series that \"hey, look! Izayoi is so cool. You must get your heart race for him!\" \\n\\n\r\nEventhough he break his right arm on the last episode. Still, he is too perfect. He doesn't flinch or what. It's as if he knows that it's coming. \\n\\n\r\nThe other character's is also great, but not overpowered like the Izayoi. I like the character of Asuka more than him. \\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it quite a bit since there is an action every single time. \\n\r\nBut I also find it boring when Izayoi is on the move. I just feel like saying \"Yeah. Yeah. I know you're great so shut up and get out of the screen.\"\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the last episodes where the story of Piper of Hamelin takes place. It's a famous story, I think. And I love to see more of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is good. I can't say it is worth the watch so watch at your own risk. \\n\r\nI find it boring. \\n\r\nI find it exciting. (The Last Episodes)\\n\\n\r\nI'll gladly watch the next season if there will be one. :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show is bad. That being said, it's enjoyable.\r\nThis review has minor spoilers\r\nThe show is effectively No Game No Life, but with worse animation, less interesting \"games\", and more punching\r\nThe thing is, No Game No Life had creative games that were twists on real games. The Gift Games always end up with people fighting, and very little else. There's a card thing at the start to prove how incredibly smart Izayoi is, but other than that there is no real puzzle, or Izayoi figures it out instantly with no evidence, pulling from a seemingly limitless pull of random knowledge that we don't know how hehas. Apparently there's background on him in the manga, but I'm reviewing the anime, so the manga doesn't matter\\n\\n\r\nI'm mentioning Izayoi a lot, and that's because he's the main issue I have with the show. \\n\\n\r\nHe's incredibly smart, not in a way that makes you think someone real could figure it out if they were smart enough, it's just like the knowledge was beamed into his head.\\n\\n\r\nHe will never lose a fight in the show, I can tell you that. Every fight but the last one he's in is a complete stomp. It's pretty much one punch man, but without the humor and hyping up someone only for them to be killed in one punch. \\n\\n\r\nLet's be honest, he's a textbook self insert character. He's an incredibly powerful(not for anything he did, just magically strong) perverted teenage guy who wants to enjoy himself in a fantasy world. That's pretty much the show's demographic. I can tolerate overpowered characters if they are played off as a joke(Saitama from One Punch Man), have some physiological or emotional conflict going on(Nanami from Katanagatari), or are against equally powerful characters(Alucard from Hellsing) \\n\\n\r\nIzayoi is none of those. He's just a teenager who wants to perv on girls and have fun...and is somehow more powerful than anyone else\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about the show is the character interactions. Because, regardless of all that complaining I just did about how boring he is, I did enjoy the show. I enjoyed the characters having various spats, Izayoi and Shiroyasha bonding over trying to make Black Rabbit's outfit lewder, Yo and Asuka's slightly awkward friendship, and Jin trying to be more adult.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight were okay, entertaining in an over the top way, but just go watch Sengoku Basara for that. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was average, pretty good at times, painfully bad and low res at others. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story was extremely dull, had no real logic, and had nothing going on for it.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the music was good, it definitely had a few hype moments.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the show is okay. It's nothing great, it's nothing deep, it's nothing breathtaking. But it is fun, it does have enjoyable character interactions, and it does have a bunch of overpowered assholes screwing with the balance of power.",

Transporting unique individuals and transporting them to another world is a great idea but it has been done before and isn't anything new but I think in this particular anime series it complements the story line really well. I am scoring the story line a solid 9/10.\r\nArt\r\nThe artwork done on each and every character was done really well, so I have no complaints whatsoever on the art work. Scoring it a solid 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe Opening theme and closing theme is one aspect that I liked also the background music and battle music is well balanced in the series. Character voices can be clearly heard so for this reason I am scoring it a solid 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThis series has some of the most interesting characters I have seen in an anime series. The main characters is very unique and interesting in there own way. Even minor characters are well balanced and interesting. Watching episode after episode the viewer gets to learn a bit more about each character as well as what role they fill in the group. Also the one MC is insanely overpowered which is fun to watch. So I am scoring a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nEach episode was a joy to watch even if there aren't any actions scenes happening it still keeps the viewer entertained through out until the end. Some of the battle scenes is really short and doesn't get dragged out but that is a plus considering the series is only 10 episodes long, but there a a couple of fights that was really well done and fun to watch. So I am scoring a 9/10.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIf you the viewer is looking for a fun action short anime series I would recommend this show to everyone. Everything about this series makes for a great anime. I am just really sad that so far there isn't any word if a season 2 will be released. As mentioned before I would recommend this series to all anime fans out there so I am scoring a great 9/10.",

Onto the review:\r\nOverall 10/10-\r\nWhile not finished yet the story and setting is a perfect example of world building. You throw charters that we can relate to into an unfamiliar setting and then as they learn about the world so do we. It also skips the ramp up that plagues most action anime as well as having to have the MC beatento death each time before he can beat the next guy.\\n\\n\r\nThis world is truly interesting and the challenges (games) adds a very nice twist, with them we have constant access to different types of battles that can't always be solved through straight force. This is good because the MC is so over-powered that if all he needed to do was beat someone this would get quite boring. The restriction added in give a great challenge to the cast without needing them to be stupid or oblivious to their own powers as you typically see in other shows. I think this aspect of the story is what I like so much, the characters always need to be on top performance because the challenge can restrict them, therefore they don't have to act like idiots to make things a challenge for them.",

The world that you are introduced to in the first episode was an interesting concept and I thought the story about how the characters came to be there was quite intriguing. However, I feel like there was a lack of explanation and development on the story.\r\nThe animation was quite pleasing to the eye. In some of the fight scenes, particularly scenes involving Izayoi, there is some cool animated effects, however nothing breathtaking.\r\nI thought the OP was okay. I liked howit started very mellow and then transitioned to a quite intense rhythm, but it wasn't amazing. The END was cute, and I enjoyed it a bit better than the OP.\\n\r\nOut of the three main characters, only two got a brief back story in the anime, and the one that didn't was the one I was most interested in finding more about. I wish there was more development with the characters relationships with each other, and more development with the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the anime had quite a slow start, however from time to time I would become intrigued by something mentioned or a new development in the story/with a character which would motivate me to keep watching. Although there were moments which I really enjoyed, there were quite a few parts where I zoned out and wasn't engaged.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there are many aspects of this anime which I enjoyed, however I did feel myself losing interest whilst watching it and needed to consciously force myself to pay attention.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Average",

            "content": "\"Problem Children Are Coming From Another World Aren't They?\" is a fitting title for this anime. Long, drawn out, and hard to look at. I first stumbled upon \"Problem Children\" after being told it was similar to \"No Game No Life,\" which I thoroughly enjoyed. Unfortunately, where \"No Game No Life\" shines, \"Problem Children\" comes up short.\r\nStory - 5\r\nThe story begins when three kids, You, Asuka, and Izayoi are brought into a new world in a different dimension and different timeline because of their talents in their own worlds. Using their own unique talents, they set out to help Black Bunny rebuild her community. Thefirst few episodes are actually not bad, and we see these talents cleverly utilized in different game sequences that includes a game of \"pick the face card,\" and a game of punchies against a god. However, it only goes downhill from there. The entire original plot ends up being forsaken as a new enemy comes in to wreak havoc on Black Bunny's world, or something like that. The change in plot happens so suddenly that you just can't seem to care much about what's going on anymore, and just want to see more games which become in-existent. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThe art quality is nothing special, but definitely nothing to slouch at. Black Bunny's world contains a wide variety of beautiful backgrounds and interesting landscapes that are a pleasure to look at. The main drawback is that the action sequences towards the end could have been animated better and are hard to follow.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 4\\n\r\nThe real low point of \"Problem Children\" is the static characters. None of the main characters have any kind of interesting back story, and just come along on this mission because they have nothing better to do. The male lead, Izayoi is probably the worst of them all, as his talents and powers are never explained despite him being the \"main\" character and the strongest of the group. There really is no reason to root for the main characters in this show unfortunately, and I just couldn't care what happened to them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nThe first half was somewhat enjoyable and had some good comedy, but the second half skips out on the comedy and instead focuses on action scenes that to be honest aren't very good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nOverall, \"Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't they?\" isn't necessarily a bad anime, but is in no means a good one either. Forgettable characters, uninteresting plot, and an unexciting second half leaves \"Problem Children\" with something to be desired. If you really enjoyed anime such as \"No Game No Life\" then \"Problem Children\" might be worth checking out, but don't expect it to be as entertaining as the former.",

            "content": "I finally review an anime from this year! (yay!) Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? is a delightful little anime about 3 powerful children that end up in a world that is run around the idea of risk and reward games, and where everything is for the sake of the player's enjoyment. But is it for the enjoyment of the viewers as well?\r\nThe thing that was most appealing about this anime was the concept of the world this anime takes place in, Little Garden. It has it's own unique set of rules and laws (and when I use this term I refer tothe rules of it's own universe) that it follows pretty closely without slipping on details for the sake of plot development. There were also some moments in this anime that honestly made me laugh and go \"awwww!\" like a school girl (masculine thoughts Gavin, masculine thoughts). However this is where the uniqueness ends, as everything in this anime slowly turns into Anime stereotypes, and usually not the good kind either\\n\\n\r\nFirst problem, the characters were very bland, giving me the feeling that I've seen in before but done better. The main problems stemming from the male lead character. It is clearly his job to do all the fighting, but he does so with such unsatisfiying style. Pretty much every fight he ends up in is over in one punch. He never seems to ever come close to losing, so he never had a chance to grow or get better! I picked up this anime because I was told this character would be like Kirito from Sword Art Online (a really great anime btw), but at least HE was able to lose and better himself from it! \\n\\n\r\nFinally, this anime jumps all over Anime character stereotypes to the point where I feel it kinda makes fun of me. There are Tsundere characters (cold on the outside, sweet on the inside) that slowly appear. There are characters who are wearing as little clothes as possible for the sexual appeal. There are literally 3 loli characters (little sister type characters). It even goes as far as animal people, ANIMAL PEOPLE!! And to top it all off, a mediocre mech battle..... come on, really?\\n\\n\r\nWith an ending that doesn't really conclude anything, and doesn't leave me wanting more. I give Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? a 5/10. Good to watch if your looking for a short and sweet anime to put in between long ones, but on its own it's pretty meh. And god is it hard to type out it's freaking name!",

As I can tell he's the \"selling point\" of this series and because I didn't think that he was cool or a good character, the series just came crumbling down.  Also, yes Kurousagi is cute buta cute girl doesn't save a show from being terrible.  \\n\\n\r\nThe world building is also terrible.

The story has a fan-fiction like over the top plot points and cliches.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started writing this, I thought I would give this show a 5 but then as I thought more about it, I think this show isn't a 5 but a 4 or a 3.",

Personally i still think no game no life is much better but this one has the same charm and enjoyment that no game no life has. the biggest difference between the two in the story is that in this anime its three main characters and they are all from different dimensions. But that didnt disturbe me , but what did disturbe me however is that there where far to many holes in the story and plotsthat happened throughout the series. But if you where more looking for the same premise that no game no life had then this shouldn\u00b4t bother you is it didn\u00b4t bother me.But that depends wether you like it or not so i hope you have a fun time watching it!",

Not the best for the other but, watching this, I have more fun to watch it than Shingeki no Kyoujin \u00abAttack On Titan\u00bb. I will begin why, one day I go to crunchyroll and see this first remark \u00aboh!Usagi-onna\u00bb.\r\nWhen I begin it, the first episode was hilarious. One of the main character name \u00abIzayoi\u00bb make a lot of shit in the other world. Seriously I get exited when I see it.\r\nStory: It was good, but don't just check the anime. You will be sad for thestory in the anime compare to the manga or the LN. 10 Episodes was just, to SHORT to advance in the story. Sorry but in the OVA, we don't know why they are in this place.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Great, I was an habit of this style and at all end episode, one of famous drawer make an art by exemple Fujima Takuya, the drawer of Lyrical Nanoha Vivid. I don't see much problem to the art, but for sure it was very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening was very good \u00abBlack or White\u00bb that make a good point for the animation. Sound track was very good too. I like the ending but that don't make the anime better than the opeing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I REALLY like Kurousagi she's my WAFU =w= *joking*.\\n\r\nIzayoi was too over-power for a main character, but that was hilarious for this point. Some of the main characters was just useless and that was bad for this point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Outstanding! I Just have too much fun to watch it and just because of that I buy the manga and the LN. For have more fun. I'm now a big fan of the series. For a Shonen-Seinen series that have punch and we don't know what the character will do in the situation compare to some anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: People will say I'm too generous but I just like the environment it's my style of anime and who's who like \u00abDog Days\u00bb will surely like Mondaiji. That don't really have a comparison with both of them but it's in a other world than our world. So yes just a little bit. \\n\\n\r\n8/10 Very good Anime for 2013",

It has a great mix of comedy and action, taking advantage of the different characters personalities.\r\nSo basically it's an anime that I would thoroughly recommend to anyone who likes No game NoLife, etc. ect.",

Especially in Izayoi, the over powered, violence addicted bastard you can't help but love and Fan Favorite.\r\nFor those who have not seen it subbed and have no attachment or impression on the Japanese cast (And lets face it you probably don't speak Japanese and can't truly pick up on all the emotion in the character' voices)it's probably not going to be such a bad expiriance.\\n\\n\r\noverall I would rate the dub's watch value Medium.

In my opinion it deserves like 50. The challenges are cool because they're based off real life folktales and events. It's great that theres a manga but since theres only 15 chapters it's unlikely for a season 2 of an anime. It really depresses me because this was like OUTSTANDING 11/10. I just love thisso much because i'm tired of boring lame MCs like (Yukki from Mirai Nikki) also since the concept of it is great, and theres actually history logic to it. To me this anime deserves to be at the top of the leader boards. More Manga and Season 2 PLeAsE!!!",

More information on the founders of the Garden we know they exist because Kurousagi referenced there existence.  \r\nOverall: This anime should be better well known.

In other words, the signs of a good structure can already be seen, such as competition between Community in fighting the big names and the seven gates that set of power among them. However, at the same time there are still many other things that are so vague in Hakoniwa, such as a hierarchical system that is in them, who included Maou, or how exactly the position Floor Master. Whether anime is trying to make his world is too complicated or is he just has notdared to give him a clear form, Hakoniwa still feels very chaotic. Similar problems also exist on the part of the story. Despite having a fairly simple plot - beat Maou to restore the glory of the No-Name - the framework of the story is immediately apparent, namely through a series of gift Games. Like a stage-the stage in a video game, looking forward to what and how the game is going to go through the characters always fun. However, the fun is just up there - looking forward, because it turns out games in this anime is not varied enough. In the end, everything is just going to be just a power struggle, and the main character is able to withstand any attack and penetrate any defense, even tense moments has never appeared. In conclusion, this anime show a lot of potential, but for this series, the potential still feels wasted.",

            "content": "Well for my second review I felt like writing about something I didn't like as much, Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? First, I want to start off by saying this. I watched this show because It was recommended here as something to watch if you liked No Game No Life. There is an inherent problem with recommendations. Often, they are made because shows  share a similar premise. NGNL and Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? (That is a kind of long title) are set in similar worlds, but their spirit is way different.  I will try to keepmy opinion of this show separate  from NGNL but a lot of my criticisms of the show stem off the comparisons I made. \\n\r\nStory(4/10) \\n\r\nWhile I like some things about this show it has a problem of anime adapted from light novels. That is it is slowly paced. There's nothing wrong with having a slow story, but I think in this case it hampers the story. Another problem with the show is the premise. The game system the world runs on just makes no sense. Why? I don't see any rules other than inside the game and if there are any rules they are not followed at all. We see the villains kidnap and kill captives(including children), spread diseases, steal, and commit acts of genocide. The story doesn't do much to explain why lawless villains need  to compete in such trivial games. It could be because the protagonists are so powerful that they wouldn't stand a chance in a normal fight, but most \"games\" they participate come down to a physical battle anyways. Talking about battles brings up another point about the series. How anti climatic the conflicts are in this series. The three protagonists have near limitless power to the point that only ever 2 of them have ever been rendered useless. The male protagonist beats an ocean god in the first episode with one blow to emphasize how ridiculous it is.  Does title mean anything in this show? To answer that, not really. Characters are given rank like demon lord, floor master, judge, God and they are all just as likely to be defeated or rendered useless. \\n\r\nSound (9/10) \\n\r\nI can\u2019t insult the sound. The OST is fairly nice and I like the ED. As for the VA\u2019s they do their job well for being the characters they are. \\n\r\nArt (9/10) \\n\r\nI like the animation too. The show is enjoyable on that score.\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10) \\n\r\nThis is where the show scores some bad points with me. First of all with the protagonist Izayoi, I don\u2019t like him very much. Is he arrogant? The show likes to claim he is but he seems to have a plan for every eventuality. It\u2019s not that he needs to though as he is the strongest character in the show. Is he dumb? Not really, the show really loves to emphasize his high intelligence. Is he weak? Defeating a water god with one blow gives you that answer. Okay, I give up does he have any flaws? He is kind of perverted but some anime fans consider that a feature. Izayoi has the least character flaws and the most plot armor out of any character in this show. Moving on, there is Black Rabbit, the character whose shirt is most likely to come off. That is all I have to say. Asuka Kud\u014d girl from post-World War 2 Japan (all of them are from Japan) who can command anything organic or inorganic to do anything (the show somehow limits this power) and is really polite. There is Y\u014d Kasukabe, the Hawkeye of the group from future Japan with a magic wooden amulet that allows her to take the powers of animals and creatures she has befriended.  \\n\r\nWhat I really don\u2019t like about this show is that the characters have no connection. The explanation of superpowers or \u201cgifts\u201d as they are called is that they are just there. Some people are born God some people are born normal. Not much is stated to how the rest of the world perceives this. The protagonists come from different universes and not just in terms of origin. I just don\u2019t see much interaction between the three protagonists or very much exploration into their backstories leaving them kind of half baked. \\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)  \\n\r\nI can\u2019t say I hated Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?. There were loveable moments and some great scenes. Its art and sound were very good. That being said, it could have done a lot to be a better anime in my eyes. Would I recommend it? Not necessarily and definitely not on the pretense that you enjoyed No Game No Life.\\n",

Bad in a way that they're so undefined, in a way where everything goes, anything could happen really, so called rules seem arbitrary, whole world makes little sense... It's just that in the face of all that, the less serious the approach the better, and the more serious and dramatic this tries to be, the more it fails, but when it's being just a silly comedy, it's pretty great. \r\nThere are some great lines here and there, and the concept of protagonist's superpower basically being that he's absurdly overpowered, isquite fun in itself, and not something seen all that often. There's no actual good plot here, but characters are fun and adorable, and humor is fun. Production quality is quite nice. Soundtrack stands out for being pretty unique in a good way, and OP/ED music and animation are great, especially ED.",

As for me, the pictures led me to think it was a harem at first, however, when I completed this series, it was actually enjoyable and has story in it to a certain extent.\r\nI'm sure that all who watched the series will have no problem with the art. The enjoyment is there, comedy is present in each episode and a pretty cool fantasy anime. \r\nI wont keep this long anyway so... \r\nThe characters, basically the 3 three of them and the rabbit,are all likeable and fun to watch. Just one problem, the main male character 'Izayoi' is kinda really OP that it gives away some suspense here and there... However, the series only has 10 episodes and it won't really hurt much to finish watching.\\n\r\nSo overall, its not just another harem series, i'd say the word should be a fantasy anime, fun to watch and fantastic animation. \\n\r\nSidenote* just one OVA episode",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Mondaiji-tachi. I should say now that I love shows like this. This is my second time watching Mondaiji and I love it just as much as the first time I seen it. Anime seems to have world building down to a science. I could only hope to receive a letter and be taken to such a place, even if I don't have any superpowers.\r\nThe story of Mondaiji revolves around 3 humans from different timelines who have been summoned to this alternate world. This world is inhabited by a variety of people and beings, including but not limitedto gods, demons, vampires, ghosts, catgirls....etc. These people form communities and try to win games to expand their communities in a variety of ways. Our three main characters are summoned by one of the weakest communities and must help them get back on their feet. This is super interesting to me and I loved this world immediately.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime progresses we seem to pull away from the game aspect. Though its still in the mix of the action, it feels as though it was more of an afterthought. Early in the show we are show some of how the world works, and some of the powers our three main characters have and how they stack up to these supernatural beings that inhabit this world, which they call the \"Garden\". The later half of the show is where we see our first big confrontation and where our characters must grow to overcome the challenges they are faced.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were well done. Art wasn't anything to write home about. The soundtrack was pleasant and fit the mood of the anime very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nOur characters are not very deep or thought provoking. We have our male lead(Sakamaki, Izayo) who is very strong, very much an op character. For those of you who dislike that Idea for some reason, you will probably have trouble enjoying the show. He manages to plow through gods, demon lords and anything that stands in his way without much effort. He also is intelligent and can come up with schemes. Our two female leads are Kasukabe, You and Kudou, Asuka. Kasukabe's power is to talk with animals as well as use their abilities. She can have the strength of an elephant, walk on air like a gryphon as well as has animal senses like keen hearing and smell. Asuka has the power to command things to do what she wished. Her power is rather abstract though as she can command items to give her their powers. \\n\\n\r\nOur side characters like the lunar rabbit, the gate keeper and the children from the community all play a small part. Most of the time they are their to explain something and to be of comedic value. As mentioned earlier the characters are not very deep and feel very forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nEven though our characters are shallow the enjoyment of the show isn't hampered. Exploring this world and watching as our main characters progress keeps your attention. Some things do take you out of the world for a short time. The first couple of episodes Izayo wins a rather lucky prize that's too good to be overlooked. Similarly our characters all are very arrogant and constantly start fights and games which could hold serious ramifications for the community as if they are nothing. They didn't handle their world as nicely as no game no life, however this anime is nothing to ignore. It has its faults but this genre of anime isn't very common and it was handled good enough to be worth the time spent watching its 10 episodes. I really wish there would be a second season but it doesn't seem as though one will come out.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; Give this a watch, its funny, interesting and semi unique. Has some flaws though and if you don't like op main characters I wouldn't bother.",

            "content": "Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? is a fun filled anime with vivid imagination, amazing artwork and adult humor for a teen show. I wake up every Friday with a smile on my face waiting for it to upload on my anime site. Honestly I am sad that it is only signed for 10 episodes. I wish it can go farther especially since they have so much potential. They have introduced many characters, different levels of cities that the main characters can advance etc. Maybe it's a sign for a second season (hoping and praying but unlikely). \r\nstory(10)- It is original and entertaining.3 kids with unique powers and join a community less fortunate than most and build it from the ground up by playing games, and they can bet something  extreme such as their lives to something simple such as commanding someone for a day. \\n\\n\r\nArt(10)- That art is amazing. It is new so it better have amazing art. I have seen a new anime with crappy art style before and it just killed the whole thing for me. \\n\\n\r\nsound(10)- I am the type that doesn't care too much on sound. As long as it is aligned perfectly with the anime I am good to watch. So whatever site you see it on or if you download it (what i do) sound is completely up to you on this judgment. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters(8)- I graded this the lowest because they have potential to expand. The characters are fine but they don't really go to much into depth with them. I would like to have more episodes to find out more. One day you see these people then boom onto another person. I need character depth to fully understand some of these characters and appreciate them for who they are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10)- As I said previously for me to wake up on Fridays with a smile on my face tells you something. I am watching older anime because current ones are slow or not amusing to the eye. (sorry I am a dude I like certain anime) The story line is the hook and this anime caught me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I hope you all can trust my judgment and see for yourself how I thoroughly enjoy this anime.       \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Of course, opening and ending can't be called terrible, moreover, they're suited to the mood of this show, but something like this I personally heard in \"Kill me Baby\" and \"Ebiten\", for example. 6/10.\r\nStory, enjoyment and art are united inone intention: when in the final episodes story becomes totally eclectic with the elements of one German legend and some historical facts from the Middle-Ages European history, art becomes similar to the style of the 80's and due to that enjoyment becomes really impressive.\\n\r\nOverall \u2014 7/10. I definitely won't rewatch this, but I didn't regret the time spent on \"Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\".",

I WANT MORE!!\\n\r\n-some kind of puzzle that has to be solved to beat the game. when I rewatched this anime and reach this part I always want to stop watching (right, I rewatched this anime many times).\\n\\n\r\nOther things:\\n\r\n-story: I can't really say anything about the story since it's really hard for me to explain a story. the story is not connected each arc, so it's kind of episodic.\\n\r\nwell, let's just say the story is nice.\\n\\n\r\nby the way, when I say 'nice' it means it can be enjoyed.",

Well, this anime kept me entertained from the first episode to the last. \r\nThe Story is really interesting. The three main character who were bored on the planet earth and wanted something amazing to happen in their life and all of a sudden a mysterious letter comes to them and they magically go the Garden world bya rabbit girl. The Garden world is all about Game, Community, demons ( More like a boss fight ), you should be very intelligent to win games and survive. Really interesting. What i didn't like about this anime is that the story is not solid. Well, they introduced the characters, what is garden land, what is a community and they want to make their community powerful again is all nice but they introduce villain character however they like. What I mean is that they introduce a villain character like, In the year 1287 something happened and this villain was created and after the villain character gets destroyed, the next one will be like, he is vampire villain... I will be like, what the hell !!! It's just not solid, they introduce however they want and it doesn't look good... \\n\\n\r\nArt was pretty decent. Not amazing or horrible. Even the Sound, opening and ending, soundtracks were pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\nThe character were nice but not great. I like that all the main character have opposite personalities...",

            "content": "Is there even a way to get a good story together with only 10 episodes? You can argue about it, but the best way to find it out is to actually watch 10 episodes. After I have finished some of those anime completely, I can definitely tell: Yes! It is possible. However, it needs to be very well written and the producer has to know exactly how quick your story has to evolve. Did Mondaiji manage this? No - it didn't. But that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable. Here's a better explanation:\r\nThe anime is about three kids with special abilities transported to another world wherethe inhabitants participate in various Gift Games. These are games in which you and your opponent wager something; with rules and a referee. The kids soon agree to join a small community to up against the more powerful one because, after all, they are bored kids. \\n\r\nThe story itself seems pretty basic and go on very quickly. Sometimes you wish it is a bit slower, but what do you expect in 10 episodes. It is explained in different flats and that's what gives it the depth it needs. Still, it's nothing new or special.\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe three main characters all have a pretty unique look that nicely matches their personalities. They are the typical main characters, cool and selfish but always positive and never afraid. The other characters in Little Garden are really diverse and their outfits have a wide range as well. The imagination just runs wild when it comes to the characters. From elves to fairies and demons, there is no shortage of interesting or creative characters in the anime.\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound really fit the anime almost perfectly. You really feel how much effort was put into it. The art is beautiful and the music really lines up everything else in the anime. Sometimes overused, this is the best part of the anime.\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe straight story and no new elements are a big hinder to the enjoyment. The rest was pretty good, but couldn't let the big minus just vanish. It had great moments for sure, but those were still too \"normal\" and weren't included too often.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Mondaiji is one of the anime people with low expectations or freshman will love. But giving it a closer look shows some weaknesses. Compared to the great characters and Animation, it gives a fine introduction into the genre itself. \\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n",

However, given the opportunity, I would recommend watching this BEFORE watching NGNL.\r\nStory - 3\r\nThough the plot is, indeed, very similar to NGNL, it lacks any clear direction/goal. The 3 main characters with superpowers from 3 parallel worlds, are summoned into one different world to do... Well, what exactly? Across all 10 episodes, their goal is not clearly formed or stated. Motivation? Almost non-existent -  they just want to have fun.Furthermore, their definition of \"fun\" lacks imagination and finesse. The essence of the world they've ended up in, and its history is explored/explained to a bare minimum. Therefore, after all 10 episodes, I cannot say that I've watched a \"story\". Instead - I'll have to say that I watched 10 episodes of something, which wasn't a total time-waste, but didn't have any oomph to it as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis, in my opinion, is where \"Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\" wins. The main characters all have intriguing superpowers, complimented by interesting personalities, unfortunately the anime doesn't go into explaining where/how they got their powers from, as well as not going into exploring their past. However, this leaves the viewer with endless questions, the answers to which are only limited by one's imagination. And I personally approve of such intrigue surrounding the MCs.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound/Enjoyment - 6\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here - all of the above are exactly that - fair. The art is fair, with just enough effort put into it to not distract the viewer from the story (which is, once again, quite boring and uneventful). Sound is also OK, but nothing to get excited about - typical for a short-span anime. Enjoyment - well, if the MC beating an antagonist without much effort or tactical skill, is something you would enjoy, then this anime is definitely for you, otherwise, you would probably forget about this anime shortly after watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5\\n\\n\r\nMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? had just bare minimum in order to keep me watching throughout the 10 episodes, however, without any conclusion or a thought-out strategy/goal, it really is mediocre time-waster - one among many.\\n\\n\r\nFeels? -  Never heard of them...",

            "content": "This show came up as a recommendation after watching No Game No Life (NGNL) and was rated fairly well, so I figured that I'd give it a shot as it looked similar and I really enjoyed the premise behind NGNL.  \r\nMondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? (Mondaiji) definitely feels like a progenitor of sorts for NGNL, as it shares many of the same basic themes.\r\nWith regards to the technical aspects of the show, the art is pretty standard, and the animation is as well.  There aren't many wow moments, but some scenes are done pretty well and it is nice tolook at, if a little washed out at points. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and voice acting was also average to slightly above average at most points.  The voice actors did a pretty nice job, but nothing stood out as exemplary to me.  The soundtrack was serviceable, but forgettable, nothing really stuck with me, but it wasn't annoying.\\n\\n\r\nWith regards  to the story, what it says on the tin is about exactly what you get.  A group of powered up kids end up getting pulled into a fantasy world with a certain set of game rules and factions competing with each other through an elaborate system of game contracts and such.  \\n\\n\r\nA premise like this can live or die based on how much they're actually going to dig into the world and actually build it up for you.  The problem with Mondaiji is that it is a show that is essentially an advertisement for the light novel and not much else.  Ten episodes is just not enough to make this anime really work.  We learn precious little about the world, many of the factions, the history, and even the main character backgrounds or motivations.  While I'm sure much of this is in the light novel, not having enough time to flesh more of the story out really makes this anime feel rushed and leaving you wishing that you knew more about what was going on.  This is an unfortunate pattern with many of these fantasy/isekai shows and isn't limited to Mondaiji.\\n\\n\r\nMondaiji is even a bit worse in some respects because the way that they presented the ten episodes, there didn't seem to be much of a logical progression of events to get to some of the showdowns either.  NGNL, which came after Mondaiji also had the issue of only having one season to lay things out, but the pacing was better and it had a reasonable progression and you understood how you were getting to where they were going.  Mondaiji missed the boat on this quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nI also believe that there should have been a better introduction to the characters and a bit more background for their motivations as well.  Spending the better part of an episode showing some detail of how they were dealing with life in their original worlds would have went a long way towards setting the stage and making you relate and or sympathize a bit more with them.  Because the show was so short, most of the characters really felt shallow and had very little in the way of character development as well.  There's only so much you can do with a short season.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, we're left filling in too many blanks and while Mondaiji isn't a bad anime, it consistently feels like it's missing something that better shows bring forth.  It does deliver on what it promises, but could have been better given more time.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I don't give this a strong recommendation, but it may be worth a watch if you really enjoy Isekai shows. I would watch NGNL before this one, as it is a stronger entry into the genre, and while not perfect, does just about everything better than Mondaiji.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've seen many animes in my time and I enjoy watching what kind of story it will tell and pull me in.\r\nInitially Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? started off well in that I liked the concept of the story of what was happening but unfortunately that interest quickly fades away as I continued to watch it.\r\nTo pull me into the story, the plot has to be strong enough to support the show but for me, it felt like a complete mess, I don't know if it was heavily rushed because there is only 10 episodes so it had to cram in everything.It just felt like everything was moving so fast that I had no time to get engaged with the characters or the plot. Everything just felt like it was on a conveyor belt being fed to you without stopping so you had no time to enjoy each individual thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were probably the least enjoyable aspect of the show, there is one character who is simply just overpowered and as I was watching it, I kept thinking that he should have some sort of weakness otherwise, there is no element of danger and in the end all of the action turns out boring and stale as you see a pattern occurring. As previously mentioned with how everything felt so rushed, one of the key things that animes usually have is characters you get to know and enjoy but for 'Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?' for me, there was no attachment as not enough time was spent building character development. It was simply, here are these characters you don't know much about and here they are thrown directly into these events that they are taking part in without resistance. They felt as if they had no individual personalities or will (as silly as it sounds) but were simply told \"#1 you do this\", \"#2 you do that\", \"#3 you do this\"; normally you'd expect resistance and questioning to why you would do something but not here.\\n\\n\r\nDue to all these glaring flaws, I couldn't enjoy this show, nothing in this show meshed well together as all I could do was question everything that was going on and feel that if an 8 year old had an active imagination and he threw everything into the pot, this is how it would turn out; short story plots, characters with abilities with a lack of detail, forced together to make some semblance of something that has a plot. Been a while since I've seen something that has disappointed me this badly.",

            "content": "Stuck in another world anime's have become a pretty popular series to make, shows trying to replicate the success of Sword Art Online always try and tackle this boring and mundane genre... Now i'm not comparing Problem Child are Coming from Another World, Aren't They? to Sword Art Online, they're both completely different but all around they appeal to the same audience, people who enjoy the thought of different worlds... Now there's nothing wrong with this, I admit these shows do have some appeal to them but for the most part i've learned my lesson to try and stay away from these series because forthe most part, they're all the same. This anime falls under that category. A bunch of children who just randomly show up this world and instantly accept and enjoy it right away...\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was not surprising at all, I knew what to expect coming into this series and what I thought the plot would be like. Children show up to another world, accept that they've been chosen to save this world. Meet the main villain, fight the villain and everyone in the world lives happily ever after and they're loved forever and ever... Yay... Honestly the most boring plot I've ever suffered through and if this series had a second season I would not have continued it. The characters we're all boring as well, overpowered, stuck up and uninteresting... Well their designs look interesting on the inside they've got the personality of a sponge. and i'm not talking about a sponge who lives in a pineapple...\\n\\n\r\nSo why did I give this series a 6 if I hate it so much you ask? Well I don't like the series because of how boring and generic it was...  However, it wasn't a bad anime, if you enjoy these types of series i'd say go ahead and watch it, maybe the pretty girls will be enough to keep you watching the anime. This anime is not for me... I will likely never watch this anime again, but out of all the generic stuck in another world anime's I've seen, this has to be one of the least worst ones.",
