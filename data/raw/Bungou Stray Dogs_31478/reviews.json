            "content": "\"Stupidity is a talent for misconception\"\r\n-Edgar Allan Poe\r\nWe've all heard the famous phrase \"I'd rather be a Jack of all trades than a king of one\", but what happens when you try to be at Jack of too many trades? Well, that's where you get a show like Bunguo Stray Dogs. The second anime to be produced by bones this season, Stray Dogs is an edgy, ambitious story of an abandoned orphan who finds his place with a detective agency solving crimes and battling the notorious Port Mafia. The synopsis is what really had me hyped for the show, because on the surface it soundslike it has the promise to be something really unique. However, throughout its first season's 12 episodes, Stray Dogs never really discovers what it wants to be. Throw in some sporadic comedy, unnecessary gore along with some of the poorest excuses for detective work I've ever seen and you've got a recipe for disaster.\\n\\n\r\nI truly mean what I say with regard to the promise I had for the show. It loosely reminded meet of the anime Gungrave's synopsis with an orphan joining a powerful agency and excelling through the ranks. I really enjoyed the first episode or two with the introduction of our main protagonist, Atsushi and how he comes into the Armed Detective Agency. I was looking forward to uncovering his past as well as the origin of his mystical Weretiger ability. But after 12 episodes of watching Stray Dogs, I would like to throw a strong disclaimer out there: don't expect anything to be explained in this anime. People use magic abilities, characters appear out of nowhere and mysteries are solved with the level of clairvoyance that would make Nostradamus roll over in his grave. I digress, I can give a pass to the whole magic thing, as I expect this to be explained in later seasons... If I'm even committed enough to make it that far.\\n\\n\r\nAfter being collected by the agency, Atsushi does his best to fit in. And the man that initially recruited him, Dazai does his best to send Atsushi on meaningless tasks in order to establish himself at the agency. Perhaps it was to lay the groundwork for the characters, but I felt that nothing really happened in the first five or six episodes. At one point I thought the show was a dark comedy, the next a murder mystery, but all of the ideas that it seemed to have fizzled out into one disjointed mess. It's like the kid from your high school that never figured out what he really wanted to do and instead hung around into his 20s and 30s and made attempt after pitiful attempt to be cool. Not to mention the ghastly written comedy. Perusing the forums in hopes of finding out what I was missing to take away from the show, I found statement after statement praising the comedy in Stray Dogs. Has anime become so watered-down that feeble comedy such as the kind found here is passable as funny? The jokes are so forced and random that it made me cringe. I laughed at approximately 0% of it. I know I can't be the only one that feels this way.\\n\\n\r\nAnother mute point that was spewed at me was how each of the characters were based off of a famous writer of American, British or Japanese dissent. There is Mark Twain, Edgar Allan Poe and Agatha Christie just to name a few. The moment I thought I knew who the writers were portraying, they would do something so out of character that I had no idea who they were trying to emulate. It's almost as though the creators of Stray Dogs were trying to use this as a scapegoat. They probably figured that most anime fans have little knowledge of old literary geniuses, so it didn't matter if their personalities were accurate to achieve the same amount of praise.\\n\\n\r\nForgive me, for not all the writing is bad. The last 2 to 3 episodes dwarfed The rest of the series in terms of complexity and engagement. There are still the occasional scenes where the character's moods would shift from serious to slapstick, but I felt like overall I finally got some bang for my buck. The main villain even got some backstory and the writers offered a glimmering sliver of hope for next season.\\n\\n\r\nAs a main character, Atsushi was one emo moment away from me chalking him up as just another whiny bitch. Honestly it was uncovering his crippled past that drew me to the series in the beginning. I wish someone would've told me how little of an explanation I would get in the long run. His interactions with Dazai at the beginning of the anime were rather entertaining, but again their relationship never really transpired past the same cheesy recycled jokes and forced authoritative delegation by Dazai. Speaking of Dazai, what is with the suicide complex? I'm assuming it has something to do with his personification as a famous writer, but I found his split personality offputting and unnecessary. I mean who could be that bad at committing suicide? His true motives for recruiting Atsushi and acting the way he does haven't fully been explained, so we'll just have to wait and see what happens. Honestly, Kunikida was my favorite character of the entire show. His methodical personality and antics reminded me a lot of myself, and of course he got berated with jokes on a regular basis. It seemed like he was the only genuinely serious thing in the entire show.  The rest of the characters were thrown in to fit various tropes, and that lazy, pompous detective guy Ranpo pissed me off to no end.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is actually rather strong.  It punches you in the face both visually and with some ear-splitting metal riffs.  It's arguably the only aspect of Stray Dogs I consistently enjoyed from beginning to end.  The ED and rest of the soundtrack were forgettable but didn't necessarily detract from the overall experience.  I did quite enjoy the artstyle however.  There was something about the colors that really caught my eye... I can't explain it but perhaps it was a combination of the bigger budget and flashy fight scenes that kept my senses stimulated.  Each character was uniquely drawn, and there was rarely a repeated background to be seen.  I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that my feelings about Bunguo Stray Dogs are relatively negative.  I will probably stick with the second iteration launching in October because I've already devoted enough time to it... but only time will tell.  Hey, maybe I'll even forget about how much I disliked certain aspects of it and move on.  I'd recommend this to fans of more recent series, and people looking for generic battles and a cheap laugh.  As always, thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the rest of my Spring 2016 reviews!",

            "content": "Dramatic, mysterious, &  fun to watch.\r\nInitially, I wasn't too excited or hyped up about the show because I didn't feel any type of enjoyment. Most of the times the humor felt forced along with most of the drama however during episode 3, that was the biggest turn around for me. Everything after that episode had me completely anxious, and excited to see what's going to happen next episode! Before I knew it the damn show was over. The story itself is really engaging. I think that the biggest part of Stray dogs that I enjoyed most, was the shows well delivered, strong, dramatic andsupernatural story-line. One of the biggest issues that I had, that I also noticed a few others had this problem, was the balance. Sometimes, stray dogs was a comedy, then a drama, and then finally back to comedy. The poor balancing negatively affected my time watching it because it really took away some of my engagement not to mention my enjoyment with the show. That said, the story is actually pretty solid. In terms of the stories supernatural occurrences, it reminds me a lot of both the series Durarara and Baccano. Oh, and I cannot forget the comedy style! although, thinking back I don't remember whether or not both DRRR and Baccano used over the top reaction faces..\\n\r\nThat aside, the whole gang warfare, port mafia vs armed detective company reminded me a lot of yellow scarves vs the dollars. Of course Stray dogs version of this is more about justice than revenge. Now  I did enjoyed Stray Dogs comedic routines. It is always refreshing to have a bit of comedy and fun after dramatic or serious events have occurred. It really does take your mind off of things for a while. I believe that uniqueness was Stray dogs strong-point overall.  It is is one of those titles that's simply fun to watch because of an interesting story with unexpected and exciting new developments. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as animation and art style goes, visually stray dogs  reminded me a lot of Baccano! even some of the characters looked like they belonged in Baccano. I noticed that Bungou Stray Dogs setting and character designs have a strong 1940s-1950s feel to it. I think that whoever the key animator was, and whoever was in charge of doing the background settings did an amazing job with it. I loved watching the fight scenes occurring in this show. Fights and action scenes are perhaps one of the most noticeable things caught my attention the most. During fights, I noticed that the fast paced animation used greatly increases the intensity of the battles. In addition to that, I also observed that when it comes to fighting, when characters are talking to each other, there is also a sense of build up. I knew that right after characters would finishing talking, there would most likely be some sort of turnover and the quality of the fight would turn out even greater. Character designs were pretty interesting, the eyes were most unique to me. They weren't quite oval shaped nor were they round.  For some strange reason male characters features tend to stand our more than the females. I noticed that are drawn to be more \"pronounced\" so to speak.  They did a great job making a good looking main character for the Fujo's to go nuts over too.  \\n\\n\r\nSound was pretty great too. I enjoyed both the soundtrack and voice actors used in Stray dogs... well except Chiaki Omigawa. Her voice is like nails on a chalkboard. She sounds like a boy going through puberty, that is how bad her voice is. Every other voice actor I had no issues with. The background music was pretty good too. I like that during battles, the music would help intensify the fight. Lastly, I loved that  vocals were used in most of the songs, rather than just sticking with instrumentals.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter growth and development is featured in the show however, it's not really prominent. I feel like the events in season 2 will definitely help characters develop more so that they aren't too.. plain. My biggest issue with the characters is that none of them really stand out. Having a long lasting impression of the characters in stray dogs seems almost impossible due to their uninteresting traits along with personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment for the show was pretty strong. I think that this was easily my 4th favorite title airing this season. It does deliver quite a lot of drama, action, and mysterious elements. I do believe that because of the way the show is written and introduced that it doesn't appeal to everyone. My overall feeling for the show is that it felt too incomplete, like they are relying on season 2 to make things even better. Despite that that though, I believe that stray dogs delivered enough greatness to make me want to come back for more. I was impressed with just about everything featured in Bungou Stray Dogs.\\n",

            "content": "Bungou Stray Dogs had a somewhat interesting premise, yet was ultimately disappointing. This anime could be easily summarized as an average battle sh\u014dnen with arguably sub par comedy: not exclusively because the comedy is bad, which is hit and miss, but because of its implementation in the most inappropriate moments. This does not mean the anime as a whole is terrible, it is simply lacking as hardly any progression was made throughout its airing time making it as a whole just average.\r\nThe story of Bungou Stray Dogs is centered around the orphan protagonist Atsushi who was kicked out of the orphanage because of mysterious incidentsthat happen around him. Having no idea or clue on how to survive, he aimlessly wanders around, just to coincidently fish out a suicidal detective out of the river, by the name of Dazai. Of course it just so happens he is no ordinary person: he works for a firm of supernatural investigators. Being pulled into this world, the daily life of the protagonist begins with a wacky cast of characters. Not to mention the mystery surrounding the main character.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance it may seem as an endearing premise, which it is, only up to a certain extent: while it treats some of the difficulties the protagonist is suffering, it mostly focuses on the introduction of new characters and their respective powers. Hence, is mostly of episodic nature. The various powers introduced are interesting and varied on its own, which in turn makes it possible to have entertaining battle sequences, although the conflicts are very simple: detective firm versus the mafia. This is combined with an abundance of comedy, which is personally the biggest gripe with the show. The humor is rather basic: suicide jokes, ill-timed situational ones are such examples. What is worse, whenever it is trying to be serious, it is often followed by a gag that hampers the immersion in the narrative significantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters presented in the anime are of simple nature, with some endearing ones, while others are rather dull. The main character Atsuchi is a timid boy who does not know of friendship; combined with the fact that he is very insecure of himself and his peers, the protagonist finds himself in a constant conflict. Being labeled as a seinen anime, it does not present an interesting development akin to the genre, rather it follows that of the battle sh\u014dnen one. He experiences some character development throughout the series by interactions with the cast, and the events that happen to him. He could be described generally as a wimp in some occasions, while in others he is courageous.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the other characters, these are rather stereotypical with their own charm in some cases: the excentric airhead, the suicidal enthuthiast, the strict guy, the maniac - just to name a few. Some of these have some mysterious background attached to them, which enhances the narrative, and in exploring their respective personalities. Due to the short span of the anime, most characters remain very basic, as well as the opposing entities of the main cast. Consequently, there is little investment in the villains themselves, which is a bit dissapointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Bungou Stray Dogs was well executed which implemented some great action scenes: fast and fluid, with consistent design. As for the art style, it was remarkable with amusing character designs: although using a similar template as other anime, it is distinguishable on its own, more akin to the likes of Durara. In addition, it makes use of exaggerated facets of the characters for comedic purposes, which were lacking: this was mainly due because of the humor that simply was not fitting for the different atmospheres the anime was trying to portray.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the sound used, it was a whole well implemented and executed with befitting voice actors, although in some cases it could feel off.This mainly concerns in some cases some transitions of suspense to comedy, and also the protagonist. The soundtrack uses various tunes, jazz included, which is a nice touch to the generic notes viewers are used to. The ending of the anime was well done with a great transition, which was personally a joy to listen to. Unlike the ending, the opening is rather forgettable as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs was a show I had some interest in, yet was rather disappointing as a whole, which was mainly because of the ill-timed and arguably bad comedy. The anime falls short of even beginning to expand on the whole mystery surrounding the protagonist, consequently being quite hard to get into. Regardless of said issues, it had some great action sequences as well some interesting background stories to share, which was satisfying. Otherwise this anime is quite average and does not stand out from its competitors. If the jokes are no issue for the viewer, I'd say try it out, otherwise not.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "What happens when you get together a special group of individuals based off famous literacy authors? The answer is Bungou Stray Dogs. Only this time, they have special abilities in a world where there\u2019s mystery, crime, and all other sorts of dark phenomenon that will take your breath away. Based off the manga of the same name, this is a show that can be easily recommendable to almost anyone. But if you\u2019re a fan of supernatural mystery, it\u2019ll be an exception treat.\r\nBungou Stray Dogs is prime proof that supernatural fiction can still work in attractive fashion. The show stars a group of characters as partof the group known as the Armed Detective Agency, who specializes in missions to solve dangerous cases. It offers a select group of individuals with their own unique talents, traits, and ways that makes us wonder about their everyday life style. Then, we also meet Atsushi Nakajima, the main protagonist who got kicked out of his orphanage and ends up becoming a member of the Agency himself. It\u2019s like fate connected his life together with these individuals in a story of innovative wonders.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve seen The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or something along that line, then watching this show will feel a bit familiar. On paper, it\u2019s a pretty cool looking show with a cast of badass characters named after famous literary works. Not only that, their special powers are also based off of their well-known literature. The first episodes establishes a blend between mystery, supernatural, and black comedy. In fact, the show easily crafts a mood that is rather comical with the way Osamu Dazai is introduced. I mean think about it, the guy tries to commit suicide in an absurd fashion until Atsushi decides to save him. Throughout the show, his relationship with Dazai can be viewed as bizarre. This also expands to many other characters because truth to be told, Atsushi really is like the new kid in class. Other characters he gets associated with such as Junchirou Tanizaki, Doppo Kunikda, Ranpo Edogawa, Akiko Yosano, and Kenji Miyazaza also brings the best and worst out of him. Throughout the series, it\u2019s also shown that he is perhaps the most \u201chuman\u201d out of all the characters. He is very ordinary and has low confidence in himself from the beginning. The revelation regarding his own powers also makes him feel like he\u2019s a walking curse and that misfortune follows those who he encounters. Now you\u2019re probably asking why you should care. The main factor is that Atsushi needs to realize that not everyone can be saved. Kunikda realizes this and constantly reminds himself and others that it\u2019s a cruel world they live in. And that\u2019s a lot to say about the show. The world setting of Bungou Stray Dogs has mafias, underworld organizations, and crimes that goes beyond imaginations.\\n\\n\r\nThe story structure sets up the show nicely with its first two episodes. I will emphasize that as part of the series, comedy also plays a large factor to perhaps decide whether you\u2019d like to continue watching or not. For some, this can be very entertaining in the form of popcorn comedy. For others, it can be distracting and even annoying. Director Igarashi Takuya puts his talent at the table and his previous work with Ouran Koukou Host Club can feel familiar to those who recognizes it. That is to say, the comedy may not be suitable for everyone, in particular the timing. The adaptation itself is also quite faithful with panel by panel. It also brings in the violence that gives the show a darker tone mixed in with the humor and jokes. However, I will mention that the show does go off for two episodes around mid-season (not based on the manga). Also, the plan to adapt the series is split into 2-cours (12 episodes ach) and this review will cover the first half.\\n\\n\r\nAs some may expect, the Armed Detective Agency also attracts enemies. This is where the Port Mafia comes in as they are introduced. Working from the shadows with mysterious origins, we also meet Ryunosuke Akutagawa, mysterious member of Port Mafia who seems to have a history with Dazai. Other members introduced in the mafia also shows their ruthlessness and lack of care for human life such as terrorist bomber Momojiro Kaji. The point is that the show makes them the main antagonists for the first cour, an antithesis to what Atsushi believes in. At one point, he even meets a young girl known for the murder of 35 people yet still hopes there\u2019s some redemption for her.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, Bungou Stray Dogs is a cool looking show, literally. The characters portrays some unique personalities with their own personal powers. From tiger transformation to bringing objects into existence by just writing in a notebook, the show demonstrates the capability of attracting fan of supernatural fiction. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say that the mystery is very impressive. It\u2019s actually pretty straightforward although sparks quite the curiosity about characters\u2019 background stories. What I mean is more of the cases that is rather predictable and some of them actually feels repetitive by nature. \\n\\n\r\nBones helms the series and once again shows that they are capable of capturing the magic of supernatural genre. Character abilities not only looks cool but also decoratively presented in fashion that is extraordinary. Speaking of the characters, each of them has some unique appearance that makes them stand out in one way or another. From the carefree expressions of Dazai to the mischievous Akiko, it has something to offer for anyone. There\u2019s also a prominence of male characters with bishounen-like characteristics so female fans may find this series a nice sight to look at. The action speaks pretty much for itself with good amount of violence, choreography, and battle theatrics. I can also confess that most of the character expressions in the anime is done better than the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is a nice way to make the show more entertaining as well. From the OP song by Trash Candy to the battle OST, it gives the pleasure of what supernatural battles are all about. Character voice mannerism can also be praised especially for guys like Akutagawa\u2019s sinister tone or Daizai\u2019s sarcastic personality. Because the show is known for its catchy dialogues, the voice mannerism has to be portrayed with credibility and the voice actors/actresses does just that.\\n\\n\r\nIt is what it is. Bungou Stray Dogs is pretty much a show that can be watched by anyone from the beginning without any knowledge about literature. That being said, the comedy can feel like a bit of the hit or miss category. After the introductory episodes, the story does pick up quite a bit so patience is a key to enjoy the show. Luckily, there\u2019s an adequate amount of entertainment provided by the unique cast of characters, themes, and storytelling so be prepared for a wild ride. It\u2019s one that you\u2019ll someday come back and realize how fun it was.\\n",

            "content": "Before I settle into my oh-so-riveting review of Bungalow Stray Dogs, let\u2019s clear two things up.\r\n1. Atsushi got kicked out of an orphanage.\r\n2. Kyouka killed thirty-five people.\r\nI know this is a little confusing, but let me just break this down.\r\n1. Atsushi got kicked out of an orphanage.\r\n2. Kyouka killed thirty-five people.\r\nNow, let\u2019s move on.\r\nWhile Bungee was a pretty fun show to come back to week by week, it kinda overstayed its welcome. With some interesting ideas came a rather formulaic, and otherwise inconsistent plot, that was only held up so much by the surprisingly comedic nature of the anime, as well as the good productionvalues. Speaking of values, what is the value of 7 x 5? It\u2019s thirty-five, the amount of people Kyouka killed! She killed thirty-five people, everybody! WOW!\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked right off the bat is how Stray Dogs quickly reassures the audience that this isn\u2019t gonna be some edgefest. Atsushi gets kicked out of his orphanage (this is important, remember it) and a dark tone is set, but comedy kicks down the door by introducing Dazai after his failed attempt at suicide.\\n\\n\r\nYes, you read that correctly. A character\u2019s running gag is that he contemplates and even attempts suicide pretty much constantly. That\u2019s a thing and it\u2019s easy to accept.\\n\\n\r\nThen the love-hate relationship between the drowning fool and his partner, Kunikida, is established, a little bit of investigating and exposition later, and a small fight at the end perfectly label this as a mystery/crime action show with some good laughs and a few dark undertones. Is that what defines the following eleven episodes? Yes. But\u2026 not exactly in the optimal way.\\n\\n\r\nIn several places, the show seems to want to be a comedy more than anything, no matter what\u2019s going on. One episode is spent building up an intimidating enemy\u2026 only for them to be swiftly defeated. Off-screen. Wow. Or, a dark scene could potentially come up, like the middle of episode six, and immediately follow with Dazai goofing around in the office. Consistency is a little nice to have\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what IS consistent? The fact that Kyouka killed thirty-five people! It never changes! AND, Atsushi was kicked out of his orphanage!\\n\\n\r\nAnd even though I probably found this to be funnier than a lot of other people did, the comedy did get stale after a while. There are a lot of quirky characters and the art\u2019s shifting styles made it enjoyable for me, but after a while, you get the picture. It\u2019s generally the same jokes, the same gimmicks, especially since most of it is centered around Dazai. He\u2019s suicidal and loves women. Oh no, I probably spoiled like three entire episodes worth of material\u2026! And comedy in general is a huge hit-or-miss. Some are obviously gonna love it while others will hate it. If the first episode didn\u2019t get you interested, the rest will be a torturous gauntlet of strange humor.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, the conflicts in general are interesting, and the supernatural abilities of each character make for some good battles; most take a couple minutes, but some can be pretty long, as in, half an episode at least. The powers are pretty unique and suit their characters, either fitting their personality, or the general theme of the character. (All the characters and their powers relate to literature, most of it being Japanese.)\\n\\n\r\nBut one of the most frustrating things is the lack of involvement with the main character, Atsushi, who got kicked out of his orphanage. Sushi-man doesn\u2019t learn how to control his power until late in the series, and doesn\u2019t do so with training or anything, it just\u2026 happens. Before this, he almost never uses it at all\u2026 in fact, he has such little involvement with -anything- that one might question his role in the story. For the time being, he just gets dragged around by the agency he\u2019s in.\\n\\n\r\nPart of the reason for this lack of sushi is because, for some strange reason, Bongo\u2019s light novel spinoff, which focuses more on Kunikida, was adapted in the very middle. It\u2019s a very strange couple of filler episodes that turned me off pretty quickly. It feels weird that I\u2019m saying this to Studio Bones, but guys, there\u2019s a much better way to adapt this\u2026 it\u2019s called an OVA, and you put them after the series is finished.\\n\\n\r\nYou know who else is finished? The thirty-five people that Kyouka killed!\\n\\n\r\nAnd a little predictably, the first cour of Oingo Boingo ends with a very unceremonious episode, even though it had one of the best fights. While Stray Dogs was planned for a split-cour release from the beginning, it\u2019s not catered to that sort of release very well, given the nearly aimless first season. If this is supposed to be a preview, it\u2019s quite a long one, and the second cour has a lot of making up to do. \\n\\n\r\nSo, did you know that Atsushi got kicked out of his orphanage? Just a quick reminder on that, because that is indeed true. Bunko really wants to get this point across, for some reason, so they show the very same flashback of Atsushi getting kicked out of his orphanage whenever possible. I guess they just wanna repeat everything in this show a thousand times? Whatever. I feel like Atsushi could be interesting\u2026 being the self-insert that questions things that are happening and the people around them, he\u2019s a bit like an audience member, but not self-aware or witty in any way. Plus, he\u2019s the typical unconfident but powerful protagonist with an insanely OP ability that the bad guys wanna capture because they\u2019re bad guys. I think there\u2019s a lot that could\u2019ve been done with him, but instead, a mixed bag of \u201ceh\u201d was created.\\n\\n\r\nDazai, the not-so-desperately-needed comic relief of the anime, is definitely the most enjoyable character, at least until you get tired of his gimmick and his otherwise unbalanced personality. Here\u2019s a question, why does this guy always try to kill himself? And why is he happy about it? ...And why is he otherwise a serious character? Unlike Atsushi, who has room to develop, I think the author wrung out everything this character had and shaped him into a walking question mark.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, my favorite character became Kunikida, because his personality wasn\u2019t much of a gimmick and the laughs generated from him were often due to his interactions with others, specifically Dazai, who irritates him to no end. Plus, he has some super weird ideals and relationship goals. Whatever levitates your Gengar, man. He\u2019s a cool guy.\\n\\n\r\nShould I talk about the villains? Because aside from Mr. Edgy Bad Guy with the Rash, who ust comes off as a typical, edgy bad guy who tries his best to be intimidating and only does so for the first episode, villains just come and go with each episode. Pretty much everything they do is just kill a bunch of random passersby, because that\u2019s always sure to rev up the tension! ...Not.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, you\u2019ll meet Kyouka, who killed thirty-five people. ...This actually isn\u2019t repetitive beyond her introductory episode, I\u2019m just memeing you.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Bones crafted a predictably impressive-looking show, particularly with its gorgeous, vintage-themed character designs. My favorite aspect isn\u2019t their clothing, interestingly enough, but their diamond-shaped eyes. It\u2019s very simple but has a lot of character. They also do their best to keep the comedy alive by shifting the style to a simple, more cartoonish vibe which only animate between a couple frames and show some brilliant character faces and reactions.\\n\\n\r\nCoupled with this is a fantastic voice cast; @sushi is unfortunately weak with a rookie seiyuu, but superstars Hiroshi Kamiya and Mamoru Miyano knock it out of the fucking park as Ranpo and Dazai. They sound like they had a ball with their roles. The soundtrack, though, is just\u2026 weird. I didn\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s certainly an interesting bag of\u2026 well, all sorts of things, really. At one point, I heard a bunch of screeching and then some quiet rapping, if that\u2019s any indication. I like the OP, though. It\u2019s a pretty solid hard rock song with an interesting vocal hook and some great instrumentation. But the melancholic ED is even better, being a mellow track that transitions very well at the end of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, Bumble Stray Dogs is done for now, but will be back in the future. I\u2019ll come back to greet it again, because I do think the series has a lot of potential for improvement, but it needs to get the ball rolling fast, before Kyouka kills another thirty-five people and Atsushi gets kicked out of another orphanage.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nSound - 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10\\n\r\nPeople killed by Kyouka - 35/10\\n\r\nOverall - 5/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Kunikida\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 1\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium-high",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Due to a recent string of mysterious incidents involving a great, white tiger, Nakajima Atsushi (Uemura Yuto) is evicted from the orphanage that has served as his home his entire life. Left both homeless and penniless, Atsushi happens upon a drowning stranger whom he rescues from a nearby river. The man turns out to be Dazai Osamu (Miyano Mamoru) who, along with his partner, happens to be searching for the white tiger responsible for Atsushi\u2019s predicament. Dazai himself belongs to the Armed Detective Agency \u2013 a group of people possessing supernatural abilities that solve especially violentcrimes and combat underworld organizations. Following Dazai\u2019s lead, Atsushi is quickly entangled with the agency and the menacing Port Mafia as he struggles to find his place in the world.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs features a fairly small cast, comprised mostly of the various members of the Armed Detective Agency, the Port Mafia, and a few episodic characters besides. Perhaps the most key feature of the show\u2019s cast is that each character\u2019s name serves as some reference to a renowned author or poet with most of the references stemming from modern Japanese literature. This relationship between author and character is an ongoing element within the show and often certain personality traits or actions associated with the authors are exhibited by their respective characters in varying degrees.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this aspect of the show sounds both interesting and engaging the manner in which it manifests is very lackluster and sometimes even problematic. The actual depth of reference the characters pull from their real-life counterparts is very shallow with most characters simply borrowing their names with their abilities often titled after their author\u2019s most pervasive work. Beyond this the characters don\u2019t seem to have all that much depth to them and hardly borrow from their referenced authors in either a thematic or intelligent way. What could have been a complex and intricate parallel of ideologies and themes becomes no more than a slew of referenced names. My own familiarity with each author is incomplete and there are occasionally thematic parallels that arise however for the most part the show is quite shallow in how it pulls off this would-be-interesting characteristic.\\n\\n\r\nThough the actual depth of Bungou Stray Dogs\u2019 references is questionable, what issues arise within the show\u2019s cast lie with the characters themselves on an individual level. In terms of characterization and how the character fits into the show, Dazai Osamu is possibly the biggest offender. Whether it\u2019s his passion for attempting to kill himself over and over again and comically failing each time or his desire to find a partner for his ideal double suicide, Dazai presents an incredibly unappealing character. Beyond the fact that paralleling the real Dazai Osamu\u2019s relationship with suicide and its presence within his works by turning it into a poorly constructed gag is the height of insensitivity, the gag itself makes absolutely no sense. The very fact that a character is continually trying to kill themselves yet both fails to actually do so and will fight for their own self-preservation runs completely opposite of whatever poor characterization could be drawn out of Dazai\u2019s ridiculous character. In a number of ways, Dazai is representative of how the show handles its references \u2013 in a loose and often unintelligent way.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of the show, Nakajima Atsushi doesn\u2019t fare much better than Dazai in terms of characterization. From the beginning of the story it is quite clear that he has themes of rejection and belonging after being tossed out of his orphanage. He feels out of place wherever he goes and undeserving of anybody\u2019s interest or compassion. This is a decent start and he does develop over the course of the show, slowly coming to terms with his place within the agency and accepting his coworkers however this is not achieved without some hitches. For one, a certain flashback of his dismisal from the orphanage is often queued whenever the show attempts to discuss the themes surrounding Atsushi and its over-usage quickly becomes tiring. The same exact sequence plays multiple times an episode for more than half the series and its pervasiveness gives insight into the show\u2019s complete inability to characterize Atsushi outside of paralleling his predicament at hand with the scene in question.\\n\\n\r\nThough I\u2019ve highlighted Dazai and Atsushi specifically here, the rest of the cast isn\u2019t a whole lot better. Atsushi doesn\u2019t really play off of his coworkers at the agency as much as he predictably reacts to them in given gag scenarios. The Port Mafia, despite their initial introduction, is continuously undermined as an antagonistic enemy as their plans are foiled relatively easily which cuts the tension surrounding them considerably. And lastly, the show\u2019s cast is chronically over-involved. Bungou Stray Dogs tends to shy away from introducing new characters once each story gets rolling which causes the subsequent events to feel extraordinarily coincidental and predictable at times when the same characters keep wrapping around into relevance.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs\u2019 animation is perhaps its only worthwhile attribute. Though it fails in various ways elsewhere, the art style is crisp and unwavering while Bones presents beautifully animated action scene after action scene. The fight sequences are very high quality though they are actually rather sparse for the greater part of the show \u2013 growing far more frequent after around episode 8 and on. Despite its subject matter, a lot of the show features slapstick, physical comedy and various gags which utilize a slightly more cartoonish aesthetic. Though these gags still look good visually, they are rarely funny and often only serve to disrupt the scene at hand.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of Bungou Stray Dogs is fairly slow paced as it introduces the viewer to Atsushi, Dazai, and Kunikida as well as the existence of the Armed Detective Agency and their supernatural powers. It isn\u2019t a bad introductory episode but it doesn\u2019t present much of a hook into the show either. The shock comes with the arrival of the third episode as it features the show\u2019s first real action sequence. The episode as a whole is surprisingly bloody and ruthless despite the two proceeding episodes of mostly repeated gags between Atsushi and Dazai. This episode was actually a pretty good introduction into the brutality of the Port Mafia which would later be undermined repeatedly however its the show\u2019s earliest insight into Bungou Stray Dogs\u2019 biggest, critical problem.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the early introductory episodes, the show plays out in somewhat of an episodic fashion \u2013 featuring Atushi as he tries to find his place within the agency and one of the various detectives that work there as they team up to solve various mysteries and cases. There isn\u2019t much of an overarching plot though the Port Mafia\u2019s interest in abducting and selling Atsushi is a recurring part of the story for most of the show. The stand-alone episodes aren\u2019t terribly interesting and the featured mysteries leave a lot to be desired as their outcomes often felt predictable or coincidental.\\n\\n\r\nThe major failing of Bungou Stray Dogs is in how poorly it marries its two establishes tones as its subject matter involving murders and underground crime organizations clashes against its style of comedy giving way to very polarizing scenes. The show undercuts whatever real drama or tension it is able to conjure up with its rampant character gags. A police woman is shot in cold-blood and washed away by the river and her senior and subordinates are visibly torn up about it. Dazai then cuts into the scene, mourning the loss of her beauty and says she should have committed a double suicide with him instead. Not only does it continuously set precedent for generally tension-free scenes but it does so by utilizing the stupidest gag in the entire show. One second the show pokes fun at Kunikida\u2019s ideals and Dazai imbibes hallucinative mushrooms and the next moment people are being forcibly drowned, gassed to death, and killed as products of a black market organ trade.\\n\\n\r\nThe extremes are too huge and the comedy is too gag-oriented and dumb to allow for the viewer to take any of the more gruesome scenes seriously. The show tries wholeheartedly to be dramatic but completely fails due to its cast of primarily comedic characters who simply aren\u2019t capable of executing a serious moment either because of their exaggerated nature or comedic tendencies. \\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack didn\u2019t stand out to me very much and mostly served to reinforce the two prevalent atmospheres of the show. The music supported the show\u2019s comedy and action from the background without ever becoming too prominent or memorable itself.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nLooking at Bungou Stray Dogs  as a whole, I would warily say it has potential to be more than what it is. The show element of referencing various authors and imparting various attributes from them and their works into the characters is a very compelling idea at face-value and if it could make better thematic use of the technique I think it could yield very interesting results. With the next season already around the corner I have to wonder if perhaps the show would do better outside of the format of exploring individual members of the Armed Detective Agency each episode and instead attempted to tackle something a bit grander and more comprehensive. With these hopes in mind, the show has to find a place for its comedy and I think if it cut it entirely it would have a fair chance at becoming something worthwhile however I doubt this will come to pass.\\n\\n\r\nTo add a quick note about whether or not it\u2019s worthwhile to be familiar with the referenced stories and authors beforehand \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is much benefit to it currently. I was familiar with probably over half of the authors mentioned and a moderate amount of the literature alluded to and outside of a few shallow comparisons between characters and how the show aesthetically designed their abilities, there wasn\u2019t much extra benefit to the knowledge so I wouldn\u2019t urge prospective viewers to familiarize themselves unless they wanted to.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 4\\n\\n\r\nI gave Bungou Stray Dogs a 4 because its cast had either poor or uninteresting characterization, its story had a variety of problems, and it was very conflicted tonally causing. Its later action sequences and slight movement away from the rampant comedy of its earlier episodes improved its second half by a small margin along with the overall quality of its animation.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Bungou Stray Dogs for its action sequences and animation above all else. Though it has its fair share of narrative issues and a cast of problematic characters, its visuals are quite strong all throughout. I didn\u2019t enjoy the comedy of the show however one can tell whether or not it appeals to them by the time the first episode finishes.",

            "content": "\"Diverse & Versatile!\" \r\nWarning: Spoiler Alert. This review is filled with typographical and grammatical errors waiting to be criticized. Do not proceed if bothered. I have read many reviews about Bungou Stray Dogs that contradicts and compliments my opinion but I came to show mine.  I let my review speak for itself :) \r\n\u2022Tone/Mood:\r\nFirst, let us break down its tone and mood. Bungou Stray Dogs is one of a kind series that does not settle down to a numbered genres. If you already watched it, you might have noticed that it switches from different tones and variations. I do admit I admire it's shapeshifting.It may be shocking but I really found it <on point> and helpful. From a humurous communication styles to a serious, fatal & lethal negotiations, to even the characters' decisions based on the given situations and cases, the series takes you to a roller coaster ride without feeling nauseous but rather exciting, thrilling and unquestionably fascinating. Many animes may have had attempted to input several genres in a series but only a few succeeded in maintaining its spot and uniqueness. Surprisingly, Bungou Stray Dogs survived this dilemma. It can be confusing from another's point of view but it just simply wants to create a huge quality leaving the viewers hanging and wanting for more. It seeks alliance from various shades of flavor to generate a beautiful, decent, yet simple style. The tones are well balanced and if you pay attention to the series or manga, it isn't selfish for explanations. It is certainly its beauty that allows it to mix sorts of elements. If it weren't for it's limitless boundary, it would only be your typical clich\u00e9d mystery-tragedy anime that's forgettable in many aspect and worst case scenario, leaves you a boring impression. Its strategic goal of being diverse and versatile eventually became its assets to make it to the top shelf.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Some tones in the series/manga: \\n\r\n\u300eEntertaining, Mysterious, Serious, Humurous, Sympathetic, Secretive, Ambivalent, Scared, Hopeful, Excited, Sad, Pessimistic, Optimistic, Determined, Sentimental, Egotistical, Philosophical, Thoughtful, Informative, Comical, Nostalgic, Chaos, Impassioned\u300f\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Script/Plot/Arc\\n\r\nIndeed when it comes to exchange of words and arrangement of dialogues, the script is very well-written. Inheriting quotes and works of art characterized by the real-life authors are a very smart move of the mangaka. It isn't really distinctive using counterparts from the real world but it is a very artistic way pulling a series made up of literary motivated acts. For instance, the battle between Armed Detective Agency and Port Mafia involves heavily, dramatic, bloodbath, action, scene stirred by delicate, powerful, confrontational, self-reinforcing and logical lines of the characters. The humurous tag involved in the series isn't that hilarious but gives you a good laugh and rather a relief sigh that the characters can be dangerous but at the same time embarrassingly awkward. It balances well with the other elements considering its main genres. \\n\\n\r\nThe arcs are undeniably challenging and offer incentives such as \"the one who stays at the end will find the story very intriguing and enthralling\". Another example is The Guild Arc and Dazai's past (Both from Season 2), now we are alt+tab in a more serious environment. We see the comical mood fades into view as we are now more exposed of the darker side of the story. More and more villains are introduced and we see ourselves having trust issues. But still the series never really loses its foundation\u2014Diversity/Versatility. The emotions surrounding the different arcs are forsooth saturated and we are given a clear detail of the characters' principles and what and who they are or want to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some argues that it has no actual plot, but the constant fighting for justice and saving people lead us to crave for more (and it is still ongoing for both anime and manga). Moreover, the characters are believable and realistic when socializing, narrating and battling. I wouldn't mind telling you that the manga is doing better and better so I hope for more of Armed Detective Agency, Port Mafia and other known and unknown organizations in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the series by far did not disappoint when it comes to visualizing the characters' past and little backgrounds gathering the conclusion that its script opens opportunities for both the characters and the story plot to improve and grow better than its current state. Kudos for a very good written script!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Sounds & Cinematography:\\n\r\nBefore moving onto the characters, let's first take a look at its cinematography. Some series are totally saved by the animations or cameraworks. And Bungou Stray Dogs is not an exemption. Its cinematography is quite the philisophy of art. It uses various colors that implement different definitions. For example, brown and white are dominant when the mood is pretty stable and used in a normal conversation featuring Armed Detective Agency members. Red and black refers to Port Mafia's activities, positions, and abilities while Yellow and Green represents the power and theme of The Guild organization.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP from Seasons 1 and 2 have an excellent remarks to display. Every angle has different transitions that suits the mood of the video. The color matches the characters and the setting. It has accurate speed for actions, enough spoiler, good exposure time for the involved characters that make the viewers drop their jaws. It uses faded, darker filters and heavy amount of vignette expressing its action-mystery genre. The lightings and backgrounds prove its instagrammable status and shout aesthetics. The use of color neon green wallpapered the actions intelligently and highlights the important details that need attention. The sound is used esthetically organized by drums and electric guitars & such, (and of course Chuuya's voice yas!), Granrodeo and SCREEN Mode fearlessly gave it a wonderful performance. Trash Candy and Reason Living are your energetic and pretty catchy soundtracks you wouldn't miss whilst watching Bungou Stray Dogs.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the ending songs, compared to the opening songs, sit down to one filter for a feed. If you observe them, it focuses on blue and white colors maintaining the balance between peace and acceptance combined with dramatic lyrics of Luck Life's \"Namae wo Yobuyo\" and \"Kaze ga Fuku Machi\". The message brought by the songs are heavily filled with emotions and drives, and thus, obviously, can put you to tears. (IT IS SO TOUCHING THAT I PERSONALLY PUT IT IN MY PLAYLIST and play it everyday when I come to school). In other words, the ending songs are really, really heartwarming as the singers and the band delivered it beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up its sounds and cinematography, Bungou Stray Dogs states a perfect presentation, status, and position.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOut of all the areas I'm assessing, Bungou Stray Dogs' characters are its triumph card. From being <Gifted> and having an incredible ability to bringing life to the famous authors and their works, Asagiri has executed his characters very well. Their visuals and arts are highly clean and decent from the costumes they wear and the weapons they use. Despite introducing numerous characters from different arcs, I personally believe that everyone of them had made enough screen time and allowed the viewers and readers to adore and determine who they are. Though some of them has longer amount of exposure, it borrows us distance to recall the newest and recent characters. For example, taking the time of your life indulging the Anne of Abyssal Red ability, Rashomon, Beast Beneath the Moonlight, No Longer Human, Thou Shalt Not Die, Undefeated by the Rain, or Ultra Deduction, you'll find yourself being enchanted by other amazing abilities such as Perfect Crime, Dangai, The Great Old Ones, or Crime and Punishment.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Protagonist: \\n\r\nThe MC is kind, sentimental and genuinely cares for others because of his traumatic past that promotes us the benefit-of-the-doubt to hold on to his story longer as he proves himself he isn't just \"good-for-nothing\" to the readers and viewers. His repeated torture scenes and deja vus from his past is forgivable considering teenagers are frequently fragile. Believe it or not, it's kind of impressing because Atsushi represents millenials' moodswings and treacherous decisions. I really, really like the way Asagiri describes Atsushi. He deserves to be a protagonist despite the fact that Dazai had one of the best screen time and story. I believe this is because of his relatable past and personality.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Supporting Characters and Antagonist/s:\\n\r\nFrom my perspective, the villains as well as the side characters acted their roles the way the story wants them to and I did not feel any annoying overpowered (which is sometimes exhausting) aura among them. Each has their own SWOT Analysis\u2014 Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, which is really marvelous and wonderful. In the case of Dazai's ability, it is proven in both manga and anime that he is the most powerful among ability users but is weak in comes of physical combat and other aspect. On account of that he only temporarily nullifies ability when he touches the target. (Still, I love Dazai!)\\n\\n\r\nI hereby announce that Bungou Stray Dogs is proven... GUILTY for being ambitious and versatile, collaborating such concepts that are admirable and therefore successfully creating a well-desired product that will secure its sustained competitive advantage.\\n\\n\r\nSO STAN LEGENDS, STAN BUNGOU STRAY DOGS!",

            "content": "Written by Kafka Asagiri, illustrated by Sango Harukawa and under Bones studio, Bungou Stray Dogs, an anime filled with supernatural action has totally made it for bring us cool characters and several unpredictable elements through it episode one by one. What can I say? I just sit and watch it with \u201cgood hopes\u201d about the anime and believe it or not that hopes really fulfilled at the end. Although, the good hopes I mention in here not all of em are answered by this season, there are several reasons why I give 7 (seven) for this despite the fact of my desire to give itan eight (I wish I could but still my final whole score is 7 (seven)). Well, why the score is 7 (seven) not 8 (eight)? I\u2019ll explain it further below.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Story\\n\r\nCenters on several people who are gifted with supernatural powers and how they use them to do some various activities, for an example like the main characters did for a living as a member of association named Armed Detective Agency. The activities started from problem solving through some cases, catching culprit to bomb disposal. Well, sounds too much? Nope! Because both the writer and the director has succeed to deliver that package directly to the audience without side issue of little importance at the first. I certainly have to admire the creators for not throwing much garbage in the beginning though there\u2019s some episode not fully whole action. But, I liked the story idea very much. I think this kind of story could be a favorite for an anime fans who like an action genre. I don\u2019t recommend this anime to a fans that like full action without background story. Cause this anime show some short explanation about character\u2019s point of view and cases through several event and condition for approximately 24 (twenty four) minutes each of episode. I felt that kind of short but whatever, I still watch the anime though.\\n\\n\r\nFor the beginning of the story, I admit it that I quite confused about how the story started. Suddenly, there\u2019s an orphan who complaining in the side of long river about himself after terrible event happened to him. What I confused at that time is that, what kind of action story that the writer want to show with those kind of start? Will it be like an amazing superhero action, an extraordinary magic action or maybe a \u201cboring\u201d one? I added the \u201cboring\u201d one because I thought the good visual is trick from the creators so we can\u2019t denied to watch it. But, after I watched the end of first episode to third episode I\u2019m sorry that I ever thought about this anime that way. Cause especially from the third episode the story suddenly twist into cool and awesome action with little surprise essence from the characters that existed. Indeed, I have to disappointed that near the end  the creators still add the introduction one of character which I thought it doesn\u2019t need to. But again, as a matter of fact it well received and paid in the end of the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nI love the creator\u2019s idea to make this story not so serious, added by some little dramatized comedy that makes me giggles several times. For an example like in second episode when one of the main characters got stuck in a barrel for a reason that awkardly ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think for this season the creators did a story focus to introduce the main and the villain caharacters, not focus to main or ideal conflict to it climax or anti climax of the story yet. There\u2019s still a lot of homework for the creators or I\u2019d rather say there\u2019s event that need more to explain and that includes the past of the story and the impact of them to the characters, villain\u2019s true intention, and many other secret that important to known by the audience. And for that, I\u2019m just glad to realize there\u2019s second season for this show.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Art\\n\r\nI love how the creators draw the characters uniquely. My favorite of all is Nakajima Atsushi\u2019s design. I actually didn\u2019t like that type of character but I don\u2019t know, I mean I loved the hair (to me it\u2019s like modern style of fashionista), love from the clothes to the black boots he wore too. And I like the design of Dr. Yosano too. Black short hair decorated with a medium butterfly hairpin, white collar shirt with long black tie, black skirt, black stocking and high heels. Both the design definetely worked to plus the aura of each character and helped improve the personality of the characters. And that condition apply to other characters too, all of the the main and the villains. They made the characters are memorable to the audience and they are different one to another.\\n\\n\r\nThe art background is realistic enough. I liked the opening when Dazai fall from a high-buiding by the way. It looked cool despite the fact when his body touch the ground, he will be dead. Fortunately, that kind of event did not exist haha. Well, back to the background, I think that the creator already did best for them. Like places (from side of the river to big shipboard) and the action event that got more intense the longer you watched. The design of character, the background and the story fits and blend to one another. It is a very good job.                      \\n\\n\\n\r\n(*) Sound\\n\r\nMy first confession about this section is that I fallen in love with the ending song. Though through picture of the ending you can see that such event doesn\u2019t existed to the story yet but the song hits the feel. I definetely will keep it in my track list of anime songs and hearing it again and again. For the opening, I guess that fits well to it scene and has rising the air of the battle scene.\\n\\n\r\nFor seiyuu part, I think they all have succeed to portrayed their character\u2019s personality. Like several examples, first Uemura Yuto has made it to show how unconfidence Atsushi sometimes whenever he try to do something out of his imagination and afraid others see him as an annoying one that made them hate him till they want to ask Atsushi to get out of their sight. He started with a weak light voice but in some condition when Atsushi believe in himself, Uemura\u2019s voice could change. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, that too happened with Dazai who portrayed by Mamoru Miyano that famous and known with his character voice on Yagami Light\u2019s Death Note. He could make a line between when Dazai teasing or playing around with each other and a side when he get a serious one. It definetely improved the seiyuu cause he has succeed to present Dazai differently than other character he has already portray. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for the third example, don\u2019t forget Akutagawa who voiced by Ono Kensho. I\u2019ve knew that Ono Kensho often portray a character that have soft side or I\u2019d rather say the good one. But in this anime, (wow) it certainly showed that Ono Kensho have a wide ability to \u201cmisdirect\u201d his voice into heavy and sounded bad and evil at the same time. I admit it that I was shocked when I realize who is the voice actor of Akutagawa and he unpredictably is Ono Kensho. They did a very good job with this section.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Character\\n\r\nIf the creators have wanted the character of this anime to remember by people who watch it (especially in Japan), then they have made it. First, it because there\u2019s creativity and path that the creators have gives to this anime. And that creativity is to name almost main and villain character from famous literary author\u2019s name in Japan. Which I found that is the brilliant idea to make the introduction of the character more simple and memorable. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, the design all of the characters they have made are unique (include their supernatural power) and their personality too. Well, you will find a character that looked weak in the beginning and suddenly he could do something out of beyond and our imagination, you will find a character that looked dumb but have a strong supernatural power, the one who looked innocent but deadful, the one who looked calm but knows everything or the one who looked elegant but in the end get scary as well. You will find many different and unique charactesr in it. My suggestion to describe them all is that, \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nDespite of two good points I mentioned above, there\u2019s still some shortage though. I have realized that for solution to several conflict that one of the main character through is too simple and fast. Realisticly, that could not happened just for a moment like that, but I\u2019m still happy that after the solution, the next event get surprising feel for the audience. That moment happened for at least one or two times. Luckily, it didn\u2019t broke how slow or the fast story pace is. \\n\\n\r\nNext, as I have explained in the story section that there\u2019s some event that need more description or explanation. It relate to this character section which I realize that there\u2019s character\u2019s emotion changing drastically in one event and the problem is I don\u2019t see any causes or reasons that have been explain previously. Actually, this kind of problem often happened too in other anime that have season per season cross apart. And I don\u2019t blame for the author, the director or any other who\u2019s in it, cause \u201crole\u201d in story will get worked perfectly if you understand the personality of the character, from background story to how \u201cthe role\u201d through his or her life in the story. It needs hardwork and it is difficult. Seiyuu in here have role to portray \u201cthe existed role\u201d and they have to work together with both the author and the director. If one of them get messed up then \u201cthe role\u201d itself could get even messier. I think they have to work this part even more for the next season or project ahead.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last part is that the existence of several supporting character (I\u2019m talking about the characters beside the main characters and that includes villains too). There\u2019s several character who get \u201cshadowed\u201d by the other main characters. Actually, it because the story not so focuses on them till comes feeling that I don\u2019t give a crap about what\u2019s gonna happen to them. You will see there\u2019s some poping up character suddenly in the end of final episode. But, the problem is not the sudden poping and I don\u2019t put a conflict about the character that showed up in the last minute. I am actually bothered by some main villain\u2019s character which I found cool at the beginning but \u201creally less-cool\u201d at the end. And for the worse, they have already existed indeed but their role is so small. If i put those character\u2019s existence into percentage, you will find a big hole depends on the main\u2019s role. They are indeed have role to one condition but that condition doesn\u2019t stay for very long, just a little time (like sponsors or something). I tell you, it could make the audience forgot about them. Luckily, their character\u2019s design is easy to remember but I have to tell you again I already forgot their name after I finished watching the last episode.  I still did not know how the creators want to put them in the next season. I hoped their percentage of existence will rise up, not drowning to the ground.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Enjoyment\\n\r\nWatching this flowing from the first episode to the last episode just like that. I have to admit that I still have enjoyed watching it though there\u2019s some lackness I mentioned above section per section. Cause the genre that I thought would be heavy, it turns out to be lightier than I ever expected. Plus the comedy from this anime is awkward (I mean rare) but I still giggles and some time laughing cause of it. You may predict several that could happened, but between your guess, you will get surprised and amazed by the characters even more. For the continue, just watch the next season for seek that answer further. In all, I would like to say that Bungou Stray Dogs is recommended for all of you who likes an action anime genre with not so heavy story.      \\n",

I also love the cross-literary references that get all tangled up but somehow stay connected (even though I wish they weren't so western-focused). \r\nBut I think what really makes this show great is the way it touches on a range emotions that often stay below the surface. In particular, concepts related to the fear/comfort of aloneness, not an uncommon theme in general. This show dives right in, opening a conceptual conversation aboutwithout resolving it, leaving the task up to the watcher. Somehow it has a very nostalgic feel.",

            "content": "All Bite, No Bark? - A Bungo Stray Dogs Review\r\nBungo Stray Dogs is about a detective agency made up of \u201cgifted\u201d and eccentric individuals. Most members of the Agency wield their own unique, supernatural ability, and together they make a mighty force to combat the mafia. Also, only one of them is an actual detective.\r\nNow that I\u2019ve filled you in on the basic plot of the show, let\u2019s get right to the heart of the matter. Bungo Stray Dogs is, at times, a mess. Through a series of awful setups that only lead to decent and sometimes good payoffs, Bungo Stray Dogs shows itsinability to make a plausible plot with understandable or compelling villains. Its tone is completely unbalanced, the motivations of its protagonists are often over-explained while still remaining nonsensical, and to top it off, its main character is a total Mary Sue. Whatever there is to like about this show melts away by the time the season reaches its halfway point, and only somewhat returns to form for its finale.\\n\\n\r\nThe plotting of individual arcs in this show have been utterly atrocious. While the payoffs are enjoyable, consisting of clever twists and decent one-liners, the setups for these aforementioned payoffs range from pathetic to completely ludicrous. A fine example would be from an early episode, when a client leads some of the Agency into an alleyway. That\u2019s it. They followed a woman into an alleyway and it turned out to be a trap. Not even like a pitfall trap or something. She just pulls out a submachine gun and starts blasting away. And it doesn\u2019t really get better than that.  \\n\\n\r\nTonally, Bungo Stray Dogs seemed to have its footing for a brief second before slipping on a banana peel and falling off a cliff. The wit and comedic timing seen in the first few episode completely evaporates and leaves us with silly chibi faces for no good reason at times not fit for any comedic relief. It\u2019s almost as if the show is desperately trying to make sure it\u2019s not taking itself too seriously, and by doing so only makes it harder for me to enjoy watching. There is a time for humor and there is a time for being toned down and real, and Bungo Stray Dogs has a hard time differentiating between the two. \\n\\n\r\nVillains can be likeable. I\u2019d argue that on some level, they should be likeable/relatable. Without that, we just have an object that only exists to be detested. In Bungo Stray Dogs, that object is Port Mafia. A heinous and ostentatious group of delinquents with quite a heavy reliance on brute force and explosives. Their main goal is to capture the Blue Tiger for reasons completely undenounced to the audience. Other than that, they just do evil things on a daily basis for no apparent reason. They\u2019re as one-dimensional as it gets, and the good guys aren\u2019t much better.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the Agency? What do they stand for? How do they and Port Mafia both exist without one destroying the other? All of these questions and more aren\u2019t answered very well, if at all. Their motivation should be simple: To protect and serve. You know, just like the normal law enforcement. Instead they find themselves looking for motivation on trivial things such as: Why should they rescue their kidnapped teammate, and so on. Every moment spent in their office feels like a waste of time, something to fill up the episode\u2019s timeslot before they get to the actual point. Every character in the Agency seems to have a lackadaisical approach when it comes to their job, as if the greater good isn\u2019t enough to motivate them. In this regard, they\u2019re actually somewhat more unlikeable than the villains. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the main character, Atsushi is an orphan. You would know that by watching any single episode in the entire series. It\u2019s apparently integral to his very being, something not to be overlooked, and so there\u2019s a flashback of Atsushi in an orphanage that reoccurs throughout the whole season. It never changes or adds anything new to his character aside from the very first time it is shown. He is an orphan, he has been told he is a waste of space, and he kind of believes it himself. I guess it could be argued that it is an important part of his character, but even so it\u2019s not nearly important enough to bear such incessant repeating. Oh, and as I said early, Atsushi is a Mary Sue. Somewhere along the lines he masters his uncontrollable powers. There\u2019s no episode to explain this, nor is there even a quick training montage. Atsushi goes from having absolutely no control to holding his own in a 1v1 with the most dangerous villain introduced so far. \\n\\n\r\nThe Good\\n\\n\r\nAt its best, Bungo Stray Dogs is a fun action series that had a strong start and seemingly interesting characters. It managed to pull off some nicely timed twists and one-liners, despite the basic setups that hold it back in the long run. The characters also have some neat historical context for fans of Japanese literature.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad\\n\\n\r\nAt its worst, Bungo Stray Dogs is a poorly cobbled together setup for its second season, of which I am not excited for. The cast seems interesting and enjoyable when first introduced, but that fades away with every second spent with them. The villains are un-relatable garbage people with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and the heroes are not much better. The amount of time wasted on the protagonists acting silly and squabbling in their generic office setting would have been better spent filling in the plot holes and leaps in logic that are all too abundant in this series.",

            "content": "Bungou Stray dogs\r\nWhen i watched the first 2 episodes of this anime i had really really big expectations about it but in the middle of the series it kinda went down. Here\u2019s why:\r\nStory 7/10:\r\nHonestly the plot is really interesting and the fact that the names of the characters are actual authors and that the name of their powers are the names of the books they made It\u2019s something unique for me and I really liked that. The problem is that as I watched the first episodes I expected mystery and action and what I got was A LOT of comedy. This show is like 30%action and mystery and 70% comedy, this weird combination kinda works out but it\u2019s absolutely not what I expected. At some points the story became nonsense and predictable but besides that I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nI really liked the animation, probably the part i liked the most of this anime. It\u2019s very detailed and the action scenes are well done. I also want a moment to appreciate atsushi\u2019s eyes, they are by far the most beautiful and hypnotizing eyes I\u2019ve ever seen in any anime.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is average as well as the opening, nothing special BUT I have to say the ending is BEAUTIFUL!! It became one of my favorite endings of all time. The voice acting is pretty good and I also heard some new good voices. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10:\\n\r\nThe characters are lovable and cute, I liked the design and as I said before they are based on real authors and that\u2019s something really cool for me, but we had almost no character development and at times I felt the characters kinda bland but hopefully we get to know them better in season two.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment 7/10:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime and I looked forward to every week\u2019s new episode, even tho it wasn\u2019t what I expected I had fun watching it. If you like comedy and a little bit of mystery and supernatural powers give BSD a try. \\n",

The eyes, they are just one of the best things about this anime\u2019s art style. It\u2019s very original and soooo pretty. All the characters were designed so well, it suited perfect with the character\u2019s personality.\r\nThe voice actors? Did a good job, honestly Ihaven\u2019t watched an anime with bad voice actors I mean they suited the character and that all I can say right?\\n\\n\r\nNow the anime is totally worth watching if your into action/comedy/mystery/slice of life and a little bit of blood then I recommend giving it a try. I laughed through the whole series, it is even funny at moments when it really shouldn\u2019t be.\\n\r\nIt did had plot armor, but I think they did a good job to not make that too obvious.\\n\\n\r\nI am so excited for the season 2, cuz in season 1 they introduced us to all the characters and got us into the story. So I hope in season 2 that they will be giving us the rest of the story. The sad part is that the main protagonist didn\u2019t master his transformation but I hope he will in season 2.\\n\r\nI loved that the anime actually focused on all the characters and not just on the main protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe titled of this anime was brilliant too, you\u2019ll know why if you watched the whole series, it actually has a meaning behind it. \\n\r\nAnother things is the first episode, I mean that first episode will leave a really impact your view on that anime. It really got me excited for what was going to happen, curious for the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think it was a great anime, and as I said excited for S2\\n\r\nThis review was probably very random an unorganized that\u2019s cuz I am writing this real late at night\u2026\\n\r\nBut yeah hope that  this was helpful to some of u guys !! xxx\\n",

            "content": "I ended up getting so tired of hearing Atsushi's flashbacks about his orphanage days...\"oh wow, they slapped you and said you were worthless\", its not like you repeated the VERY SAME SCENE FOUR TIMES IN THE PAST 10 MINUTES!!!!\r\nSmall nuances aside, it was a very enjoyable show. Although I didn't really understand the character's inspirations until reading some other review's, I didn't feel that was necessary background in order to understand each character. The comedy, although at times misplaced, was good, and I laughed (or snickered) at most of the gags. Having one episode dedicated to explaining each Agency member was nice, although I wouldhave preferred to see more of three things:\\n\r\n1. Dazai being Dazai\\n\r\n2. Dazai's backstory\\n\r\n3. Dazai's obsession with double suicide (it's not really a spoiler is it?)\\n\r\nBasically what I'm trying to say is that he was the most complex, interesting, and misused comedic relief character in the show. An episode or two dedicated to Dazai's history with ******** (number of asterisks is random, don't bother counting) would have been entertaining, perhaps instead of the Mafia secretary episode.\\n\r\nTo be honest, I skipped the OP every time. On the other hand, the ED was slow, sad, and a good ending to each episode.\\n\r\nVisuals made up 86% of the BSD's comedy in my opinion. Chibi drawings make everything funnier and Studio Bones made good use of that, along with a good splattering of decent jokes, to keep me entertained.\\n\r\nI'll conclude by saying that Dazai is best girl.",

            "content": "With another season of anime, comes another supernatural-action title that attempts to be unique, different and original while keeping faithful to its genre. Bungo Stray Dogs (BSD, from now on) is most definitely unique arguably ingenious, but has several, painful shortcomings that unfortunately add it to the vast collection of mediocre supernatural-action anime. \r\nBefore anyone watches this anime, I highly recommend you watch The Canipa Effect\u2019s great video on the characters of Bungo Stray Dogs. You will appreciate the ingenuity of the story and understand the characters better once you learn about the Japanese literarians they\u2019re based on. \r\nSTORY: Quickly said, BSD is a poorlytold good story. As I mentioned previously, the premise of writing the main characters and their \u201cgifts\u201d based on famous Japanese literarians is ingenious, and due to the limited cultural awareness of the non-Japanese watchers on MAL, this ingenuity has unfortunately gone unnoticed and unpraised. One must be culturally aware of the Japanese literature references in order to fully appreciate the anime\u2019s story, but sadly even so, it remains poorly told. While basing characters on famous literarians is certainly original and unique, it has its drawbacks and limitations. The main characters in BSD all have unique, supernatural abilities (called \u201cgifts\u201d), and these abilities are denominated after their respective literarian\u2019s most famous works. For example, Osamu Dazai\u2019s ability is named after his literarian counterpart\u2019s book, \u201cNo Longer Human\u201d. This is where problems begin to arise. Due to the vagueness and obscurity of these ability names, several characters have gifts that are inexplicably overpowered and one can only wonder the weaknesses and limitations of said power. The majority of gifts in the show are so powerful that they almost always bend the rules of the show\u2019s universe, and this results in several plot holes during fights when characters conveniently seem to forget how insanely overpowered their gifts are. The source of the gifts is not explained once, and several abilities are explained with convoluted logic that is hard to digest.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the show is extremely typical, the protagonist (Atsushi) is down on his luck and saves a drowning man (Dazai) who was actually trying to kill himself. Dazai and Atsushi are then tracked down by the upstanding, strict supporting character (Kunikida) who is then forced to treat Atsushi to a meal. Attach an unnecessary amount of slapstick comedy and you can already you can see where this show is sort of going, and while the beginning is typical and cliche there\u2019s nothing really wrong with it. The execution of it was pretty good and as a result came off as a funny way to introduce the characters. By the end of the first episode, Atsushi is recruited to the Detective Agency, which is a legal police force where they only recruit members with the supernatural gifts aforementioned. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot progression of BSD is driven by several plot contrivances and conveniences, and the source material was adapted in such an odd way that there end up being around 4-6 episodes centered around a bomb and 3 of these are back to back. This results in a tiring, unpleasant and repetitive watch that honestly lost my interest several times. The slapstick comedy in the show was especially annoying and often ruined the tone of several serious scenes. The comedy was often unoriginal and quickly grew repetitive and annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe main antagonist group of the show is the Port Mafia, and if you are to believe that they are going to be the biggest, toughest forces the Detective Agency are going to face you are dead wrong. The Port Mafia is often portrayed as an ever present overwhelming power that threatens the safety of all the civilians and detectives in the city, but in reality, are basically a rival, evil counterpart to the Detective Agency. Several members of the Port Mafia come off as incompetent and weak and sometimes you wonder if they really live up to the dangerous threat that they\u2019re often portrayed as. Towards the end of the series you are briefly introduced to a flurry of characters that are very clearly the true, underlying antagonists of the show and they are much, much more interesting than the main antagonist of this season, Akutagawa. It seems what anyone should take from this season is that it is building a foundation for what is to come this fall, and I would say they\u2019ve successfully (although slowly, boringly and sometimes poorly), built a strong foundation. Hopefully next season uses this foundation to their advantage and is able to be much better.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all not to say that BSD is not an enjoyable watch. As I mentioned, BSD is a poorly told good story, leaving the plot to have a few profound and several unpredictable moments that caught me off guard in a good way. The concept behind each character\u2019s gifts and the main antagonist of the show was enough to keep me invested while it was airing and I can honestly say that I enjoyed this show\u2019s run and I\u2019m excited for the next season. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: BSD has been renewed for a second cour this fall, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that several of the other supporting characters will be developed next season. But for now, most of the characters in BSD are pretty dimensionless and some are just plain stupid. Atsushi and Kunikida are the only characters developed over the course of the show, while the rest are simply background characters. Atsushi is your run off the mill protagonist; a little cowardly, strong-willed, naturally talented and offers a naive perspective due to a lack of experience. At first his backstory was handled maturely, sad yet not quite melodramatic. That is of course until they repeatedly flash back to one scene from Atsushi\u2019s orphanage every single episode. This show brutally beats you over the head with Atsushi's orphanage backstory to the point where it often breaks tense moments out of repetitiveness. \\n\\n\r\nOsamu Dazai is arguably a Gary Stu (No Longer Human ability, hello!?) and that\u2019s perfectly fine and often fitting for his role as Atsushi's \u201csavior\u201d. Dazai is Atsushi's role-model and is what he strives to be a detective from the Agency, and it had (or has, maybe the second season will do this) potential to be an interesting and complex relationship. However, for most of the show the interactions are between Kunikida and Atsushi, as Kunikida is often left in charge of him. Their character dynamics are quite interesting especially considering that they are great foils. Kunikida is studious, prideful and driven by his ideals. Atsushi is often weak hearted, modest, and is driven by his desire to be a human worthy of life. Their conversations and interactions are funny and often very profound.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAUDIOVISUALS: Produced by Studio Bones, the animation of BSD is excellent. The fight scenes are animated with great colours along with great fighting choreography. Some of the character abilities are inherently boring and as a result usually make up for some boring fights, but they are nonetheless animated beautifully. Kept me at the edge of my seat and greatly anticipating several badass action scenes due to the immersiveness of its animation. BSD also has a great opening that gets you hyped for the show every time you watch it, and a great ED that is often extended to the final scenes of several episodes for dramatic effect (similar to JoJo\u2019s roundabout ending extending). All in all a well animated show with very few boring panning frames. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: Despite my qualms with the show it kept me invested for the most part and I enjoyed watching it. I was excited for every episode when it aired and I readily await the second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10: The show is not bad, but not necessarily good. The quality of the story and characters is very mediocre and all the supernatural abilities could have been the shows saving grace but end up being poorly explained and ridiculously overpowered. I\u2019d recommend this show to anyone who isn\u2019t overly picky and unnecessarily analytical and simply prefers to be entertained by their anime.\\n",

            "content": "The story's really good and I like how it progresses. It can surprise you at times but it can also be kinda predictable when you take a closer look at things...or just consider what the most shocking outcome would be. Anyway, the episodes are a bit episodic. I'm ok with this though since, as a detective agency, they have to handle lots of different things. There's also one thing that can be seen as repetitive...and that's Atsushi's backstory. They basically show the same scene every few episodes and sometimes more than once each episode. This may be their way of showing us that the memoryplagues him but I still can't blame anyone who gets bothered by seeing the same thing over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are very quirky and it's usually their quirkiness that leads to the comedic moments. Despite this, there isn't much development. Kunikida and Atsushi may have gotten a bit though. Overall, they're consistent and (I guess) have character arcs.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I like it a lot. The eyes are unique and I especially love Atsushi's. The pupils also tend to have a diamond like shape which isn't something you see very much in anime. (Or at least I haven't.) The character designs are cool as well. When it comes to seeing their abilities or \"gifts\" in action, they're usually very aesthetically pleasing. And the animation's good. From what I recall, there isn't a single scene that felt weird to look at. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is awesome. It has a cool opening song and a nice, relaxing ending song. It's like the opening gets you ready to be thrown into the story while the ending allows you to chill after everything that's happened. The voice actors are good as well. I especially like Dazai's voice actor and how he sounds when he's serious and being comical. The soundtrack is pretty good and adds to the fight scenes a lot. It's honestly good enough to go back and listen to the entire thing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, I think it's safe to say that Bungou Stray Dogs is a pretty good anime. Matter of fact, it's one of the best action comedies I've seen in a while! Because of this, it deserves a 10 overall.",

            "content": "If Naruto and 91 Days were to have a child, Bungou Stray Dogs would definitely be their one true child. \r\nBungou Stray Dogs delves into the world of mafia and supernatural powers, which is rarely seen in the industry, the closest the anime that resembles those features would be like Mushishi, which enjoyed notable success.\r\nThe plot is engaging with very little dead moments, bar the first episode which took a while to fully captivate me into the series. Foreshadowing was brilliantly utilised giving the storyline a better depth that entices the viewers to ponder and think of what is going to happen next. In termsof complexity, there actually aren\u2019t many plot twists or intricate moments for the viewers to decipher. As such, the plotline is pretty much one-track, but manages to capture attention of the audience with its high-paced action and modernised effects. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the main character, it is a bummer. Rather weak and boring. Not only that, the protagonist powers are pretty shit as well, being able to transform into a cat (tiger actually) which is a joke compared to the side characters. The sole reason I was able to rate the \u2018characters\u2019 criteria a 7 is due to the supporting cast of the anime. Characters like Dazai and Rampo had much better context and abilities while also possesses unique characteristics which makes these characters more likeable as opposed to Atsushi which has no direction and willpower without the aid of the Agency. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the grounding of the characters past, abilities and personalities are well-written. The writer doesn\u2019t simply slap information into the audiences face with no proper explanation. Abilities, personalities and characters backgrounds are decently explained with very little plot holes to criticise. \\n\\n\r\nConclusively, Bungou Stray Dogs might not give the audience a intricate and mind-blowing story, but what it does best is that it keeps the audience\u2019s attention in check. Many anime have tried going with plot that consists of difficult and obscure plot under the pretence of being \u2018deep\u2019, but instead backfired on them. Bungiu Stray Dogs despite being a genre that involves detectives and crime-solving, used a much simpler and direct route when conveying their message which was a pleasant touch (at least for me). \\n",

            "content": "By all means this show can't be compared to the greatest ones you've seen, however i believe it's pretty damn solid and i can easily recommend you to watch it, considering you're interested enough to read a review of it.\r\nNow, lets break the whole thing down in parts:\r\nStory - 7\r\nThe whole world setting is pretty simple - some ppl have superpowers, god knows why - doesn't matter. The story is pretty interesting, so if you might like the combination of genres 'Action, Comedy, Mystery, Seinen, Supernatural', then you won't be disappointed. Altough i would call this show a Shounen rather than a Seinen (the factthat characters are working adults instead of being highschoolers doesn't make a series a seinen imo). The comedy is at most places pretty juvenile and won't make you laugh out loud most of the times, however it should reduce the distance between you and the characters\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe animation/art isn't extraordinary nor anything new , however it doesn't fall short in comparison to other shows of the season. I also liked the character designes of most of the characters (especially Kyouka's).\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nI don't recall any ost from the show that i loved, it was ok though. The opening and ending did not catch my ear all that much either. However the music does work well with everything that happens on the screen and will make you more involved with the action, so i can say it's good.\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nI liked them, simple as that. Dazai & Kunikida duo is pretty damn entertaining to watch, other main characters are pretty interesting as well, i surely hope i will get to know them better in the next season of the show.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nGot nothing to say in the subject, simply seems like a cool show to watch.\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nThe show is interesting and fun to watch, it's a strong position among this season's anime, deserving to be in top 5 in popularity ranking of the season.\\n\\n\r\nTo summ up, it's a show worth watching, you will surely enjoy it, if the humor dosn't end up irritating you or scaring you away.

            "content": "\"Stupidity is a talent for misconception\"\r\n-Edgar Allan Poe\r\nWe've all heard the famous phrase \"I'd rather be a Jack of all trades than a king of one\", but what happens when you try to be at Jack of too many trades? Well, that's where you get a show like Bunguo Stray Dogs. The second anime to be produced by bones this season, Stray Dogs is an edgy, ambitious story of an abandoned orphan who finds his place with a detective agency solving crimes and battling the notorious Port Mafia. The synopsis is what really had me hyped for the show, because on the surface it soundslike it has the promise to be something really unique. However, throughout its first season's 12 episodes, Stray Dogs never really discovers what it wants to be. Throw in some sporadic comedy, unnecessary gore along with some of the poorest excuses for detective work I've ever seen and you've got a recipe for disaster.\\n\\n\r\nI truly mean what I say with regard to the promise I had for the show. It loosely reminded meet of the anime Gungrave's synopsis with an orphan joining a powerful agency and excelling through the ranks. I really enjoyed the first episode or two with the introduction of our main protagonist, Atsushi and how he comes into the Armed Detective Agency. I was looking forward to uncovering his past as well as the origin of his mystical Weretiger ability. But after 12 episodes of watching Stray Dogs, I would like to throw a strong disclaimer out there: don't expect anything to be explained in this anime. People use magic abilities, characters appear out of nowhere and mysteries are solved with the level of clairvoyance that would make Nostradamus roll over in his grave. I digress, I can give a pass to the whole magic thing, as I expect this to be explained in later seasons... If I'm even committed enough to make it that far.\\n\\n\r\nAfter being collected by the agency, Atsushi does his best to fit in. And the man that initially recruited him, Dazai does his best to send Atsushi on meaningless tasks in order to establish himself at the agency. Perhaps it was to lay the groundwork for the characters, but I felt that nothing really happened in the first five or six episodes. At one point I thought the show was a dark comedy, the next a murder mystery, but all of the ideas that it seemed to have fizzled out into one disjointed mess. It's like the kid from your high school that never figured out what he really wanted to do and instead hung around into his 20s and 30s and made attempt after pitiful attempt to be cool. Not to mention the ghastly written comedy. Perusing the forums in hopes of finding out what I was missing to take away from the show, I found statement after statement praising the comedy in Stray Dogs. Has anime become so watered-down that feeble comedy such as the kind found here is passable as funny? The jokes are so forced and random that it made me cringe. I laughed at approximately 0% of it. I know I can't be the only one that feels this way.\\n\\n\r\nAnother mute point that was spewed at me was how each of the characters were based off of a famous writer of American, British or Japanese dissent. There is Mark Twain, Edgar Allan Poe and Agatha Christie just to name a few. The moment I thought I knew who the writers were portraying, they would do something so out of character that I had no idea who they were trying to emulate. It's almost as though the creators of Stray Dogs were trying to use this as a scapegoat. They probably figured that most anime fans have little knowledge of old literary geniuses, so it didn't matter if their personalities were accurate to achieve the same amount of praise.\\n\\n\r\nForgive me, for not all the writing is bad. The last 2 to 3 episodes dwarfed The rest of the series in terms of complexity and engagement. There are still the occasional scenes where the character's moods would shift from serious to slapstick, but I felt like overall I finally got some bang for my buck. The main villain even got some backstory and the writers offered a glimmering sliver of hope for next season.\\n\\n\r\nAs a main character, Atsushi was one emo moment away from me chalking him up as just another whiny bitch. Honestly it was uncovering his crippled past that drew me to the series in the beginning. I wish someone would've told me how little of an explanation I would get in the long run. His interactions with Dazai at the beginning of the anime were rather entertaining, but again their relationship never really transpired past the same cheesy recycled jokes and forced authoritative delegation by Dazai. Speaking of Dazai, what is with the suicide complex? I'm assuming it has something to do with his personification as a famous writer, but I found his split personality offputting and unnecessary. I mean who could be that bad at committing suicide? His true motives for recruiting Atsushi and acting the way he does haven't fully been explained, so we'll just have to wait and see what happens. Honestly, Kunikida was my favorite character of the entire show. His methodical personality and antics reminded me a lot of myself, and of course he got berated with jokes on a regular basis. It seemed like he was the only genuinely serious thing in the entire show.  The rest of the characters were thrown in to fit various tropes, and that lazy, pompous detective guy Ranpo pissed me off to no end.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is actually rather strong.  It punches you in the face both visually and with some ear-splitting metal riffs.  It's arguably the only aspect of Stray Dogs I consistently enjoyed from beginning to end.  The ED and rest of the soundtrack were forgettable but didn't necessarily detract from the overall experience.  I did quite enjoy the artstyle however.  There was something about the colors that really caught my eye... I can't explain it but perhaps it was a combination of the bigger budget and flashy fight scenes that kept my senses stimulated.  Each character was uniquely drawn, and there was rarely a repeated background to be seen.  I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that my feelings about Bunguo Stray Dogs are relatively negative.  I will probably stick with the second iteration launching in October because I've already devoted enough time to it... but only time will tell.  Hey, maybe I'll even forget about how much I disliked certain aspects of it and move on.  I'd recommend this to fans of more recent series, and people looking for generic battles and a cheap laugh.  As always, thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the rest of my Spring 2016 reviews!",

            "content": "Dramatic, mysterious, &  fun to watch.\r\nInitially, I wasn't too excited or hyped up about the show because I didn't feel any type of enjoyment. Most of the times the humor felt forced along with most of the drama however during episode 3, that was the biggest turn around for me. Everything after that episode had me completely anxious, and excited to see what's going to happen next episode! Before I knew it the damn show was over. The story itself is really engaging. I think that the biggest part of Stray dogs that I enjoyed most, was the shows well delivered, strong, dramatic andsupernatural story-line. One of the biggest issues that I had, that I also noticed a few others had this problem, was the balance. Sometimes, stray dogs was a comedy, then a drama, and then finally back to comedy. The poor balancing negatively affected my time watching it because it really took away some of my engagement not to mention my enjoyment with the show. That said, the story is actually pretty solid. In terms of the stories supernatural occurrences, it reminds me a lot of both the series Durarara and Baccano. Oh, and I cannot forget the comedy style! although, thinking back I don't remember whether or not both DRRR and Baccano used over the top reaction faces..\\n\r\nThat aside, the whole gang warfare, port mafia vs armed detective company reminded me a lot of yellow scarves vs the dollars. Of course Stray dogs version of this is more about justice than revenge. Now  I did enjoyed Stray Dogs comedic routines. It is always refreshing to have a bit of comedy and fun after dramatic or serious events have occurred. It really does take your mind off of things for a while. I believe that uniqueness was Stray dogs strong-point overall.  It is is one of those titles that's simply fun to watch because of an interesting story with unexpected and exciting new developments. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as animation and art style goes, visually stray dogs  reminded me a lot of Baccano! even some of the characters looked like they belonged in Baccano. I noticed that Bungou Stray Dogs setting and character designs have a strong 1940s-1950s feel to it. I think that whoever the key animator was, and whoever was in charge of doing the background settings did an amazing job with it. I loved watching the fight scenes occurring in this show. Fights and action scenes are perhaps one of the most noticeable things caught my attention the most. During fights, I noticed that the fast paced animation used greatly increases the intensity of the battles. In addition to that, I also observed that when it comes to fighting, when characters are talking to each other, there is also a sense of build up. I knew that right after characters would finishing talking, there would most likely be some sort of turnover and the quality of the fight would turn out even greater. Character designs were pretty interesting, the eyes were most unique to me. They weren't quite oval shaped nor were they round.  For some strange reason male characters features tend to stand our more than the females. I noticed that are drawn to be more \"pronounced\" so to speak.  They did a great job making a good looking main character for the Fujo's to go nuts over too.  \\n\\n\r\nSound was pretty great too. I enjoyed both the soundtrack and voice actors used in Stray dogs... well except Chiaki Omigawa. Her voice is like nails on a chalkboard. She sounds like a boy going through puberty, that is how bad her voice is. Every other voice actor I had no issues with. The background music was pretty good too. I like that during battles, the music would help intensify the fight. Lastly, I loved that  vocals were used in most of the songs, rather than just sticking with instrumentals.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter growth and development is featured in the show however, it's not really prominent. I feel like the events in season 2 will definitely help characters develop more so that they aren't too.. plain. My biggest issue with the characters is that none of them really stand out. Having a long lasting impression of the characters in stray dogs seems almost impossible due to their uninteresting traits along with personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment for the show was pretty strong. I think that this was easily my 4th favorite title airing this season. It does deliver quite a lot of drama, action, and mysterious elements. I do believe that because of the way the show is written and introduced that it doesn't appeal to everyone. My overall feeling for the show is that it felt too incomplete, like they are relying on season 2 to make things even better. Despite that that though, I believe that stray dogs delivered enough greatness to make me want to come back for more. I was impressed with just about everything featured in Bungou Stray Dogs.\\n",

            "content": "Bungou Stray Dogs had a somewhat interesting premise, yet was ultimately disappointing. This anime could be easily summarized as an average battle sh\u014dnen with arguably sub par comedy: not exclusively because the comedy is bad, which is hit and miss, but because of its implementation in the most inappropriate moments. This does not mean the anime as a whole is terrible, it is simply lacking as hardly any progression was made throughout its airing time making it as a whole just average.\r\nThe story of Bungou Stray Dogs is centered around the orphan protagonist Atsushi who was kicked out of the orphanage because of mysterious incidentsthat happen around him. Having no idea or clue on how to survive, he aimlessly wanders around, just to coincidently fish out a suicidal detective out of the river, by the name of Dazai. Of course it just so happens he is no ordinary person: he works for a firm of supernatural investigators. Being pulled into this world, the daily life of the protagonist begins with a wacky cast of characters. Not to mention the mystery surrounding the main character.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance it may seem as an endearing premise, which it is, only up to a certain extent: while it treats some of the difficulties the protagonist is suffering, it mostly focuses on the introduction of new characters and their respective powers. Hence, is mostly of episodic nature. The various powers introduced are interesting and varied on its own, which in turn makes it possible to have entertaining battle sequences, although the conflicts are very simple: detective firm versus the mafia. This is combined with an abundance of comedy, which is personally the biggest gripe with the show. The humor is rather basic: suicide jokes, ill-timed situational ones are such examples. What is worse, whenever it is trying to be serious, it is often followed by a gag that hampers the immersion in the narrative significantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters presented in the anime are of simple nature, with some endearing ones, while others are rather dull. The main character Atsuchi is a timid boy who does not know of friendship; combined with the fact that he is very insecure of himself and his peers, the protagonist finds himself in a constant conflict. Being labeled as a seinen anime, it does not present an interesting development akin to the genre, rather it follows that of the battle sh\u014dnen one. He experiences some character development throughout the series by interactions with the cast, and the events that happen to him. He could be described generally as a wimp in some occasions, while in others he is courageous.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the other characters, these are rather stereotypical with their own charm in some cases: the excentric airhead, the suicidal enthuthiast, the strict guy, the maniac - just to name a few. Some of these have some mysterious background attached to them, which enhances the narrative, and in exploring their respective personalities. Due to the short span of the anime, most characters remain very basic, as well as the opposing entities of the main cast. Consequently, there is little investment in the villains themselves, which is a bit dissapointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Bungou Stray Dogs was well executed which implemented some great action scenes: fast and fluid, with consistent design. As for the art style, it was remarkable with amusing character designs: although using a similar template as other anime, it is distinguishable on its own, more akin to the likes of Durara. In addition, it makes use of exaggerated facets of the characters for comedic purposes, which were lacking: this was mainly due because of the humor that simply was not fitting for the different atmospheres the anime was trying to portray.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the sound used, it was a whole well implemented and executed with befitting voice actors, although in some cases it could feel off.This mainly concerns in some cases some transitions of suspense to comedy, and also the protagonist. The soundtrack uses various tunes, jazz included, which is a nice touch to the generic notes viewers are used to. The ending of the anime was well done with a great transition, which was personally a joy to listen to. Unlike the ending, the opening is rather forgettable as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs was a show I had some interest in, yet was rather disappointing as a whole, which was mainly because of the ill-timed and arguably bad comedy. The anime falls short of even beginning to expand on the whole mystery surrounding the protagonist, consequently being quite hard to get into. Regardless of said issues, it had some great action sequences as well some interesting background stories to share, which was satisfying. Otherwise this anime is quite average and does not stand out from its competitors. If the jokes are no issue for the viewer, I'd say try it out, otherwise not.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "What happens when you get together a special group of individuals based off famous literacy authors? The answer is Bungou Stray Dogs. Only this time, they have special abilities in a world where there\u2019s mystery, crime, and all other sorts of dark phenomenon that will take your breath away. Based off the manga of the same name, this is a show that can be easily recommendable to almost anyone. But if you\u2019re a fan of supernatural mystery, it\u2019ll be an exception treat.\r\nBungou Stray Dogs is prime proof that supernatural fiction can still work in attractive fashion. The show stars a group of characters as partof the group known as the Armed Detective Agency, who specializes in missions to solve dangerous cases. It offers a select group of individuals with their own unique talents, traits, and ways that makes us wonder about their everyday life style. Then, we also meet Atsushi Nakajima, the main protagonist who got kicked out of his orphanage and ends up becoming a member of the Agency himself. It\u2019s like fate connected his life together with these individuals in a story of innovative wonders.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve seen The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or something along that line, then watching this show will feel a bit familiar. On paper, it\u2019s a pretty cool looking show with a cast of badass characters named after famous literary works. Not only that, their special powers are also based off of their well-known literature. The first episodes establishes a blend between mystery, supernatural, and black comedy. In fact, the show easily crafts a mood that is rather comical with the way Osamu Dazai is introduced. I mean think about it, the guy tries to commit suicide in an absurd fashion until Atsushi decides to save him. Throughout the show, his relationship with Dazai can be viewed as bizarre. This also expands to many other characters because truth to be told, Atsushi really is like the new kid in class. Other characters he gets associated with such as Junchirou Tanizaki, Doppo Kunikda, Ranpo Edogawa, Akiko Yosano, and Kenji Miyazaza also brings the best and worst out of him. Throughout the series, it\u2019s also shown that he is perhaps the most \u201chuman\u201d out of all the characters. He is very ordinary and has low confidence in himself from the beginning. The revelation regarding his own powers also makes him feel like he\u2019s a walking curse and that misfortune follows those who he encounters. Now you\u2019re probably asking why you should care. The main factor is that Atsushi needs to realize that not everyone can be saved. Kunikda realizes this and constantly reminds himself and others that it\u2019s a cruel world they live in. And that\u2019s a lot to say about the show. The world setting of Bungou Stray Dogs has mafias, underworld organizations, and crimes that goes beyond imaginations.\\n\\n\r\nThe story structure sets up the show nicely with its first two episodes. I will emphasize that as part of the series, comedy also plays a large factor to perhaps decide whether you\u2019d like to continue watching or not. For some, this can be very entertaining in the form of popcorn comedy. For others, it can be distracting and even annoying. Director Igarashi Takuya puts his talent at the table and his previous work with Ouran Koukou Host Club can feel familiar to those who recognizes it. That is to say, the comedy may not be suitable for everyone, in particular the timing. The adaptation itself is also quite faithful with panel by panel. It also brings in the violence that gives the show a darker tone mixed in with the humor and jokes. However, I will mention that the show does go off for two episodes around mid-season (not based on the manga). Also, the plan to adapt the series is split into 2-cours (12 episodes ach) and this review will cover the first half.\\n\\n\r\nAs some may expect, the Armed Detective Agency also attracts enemies. This is where the Port Mafia comes in as they are introduced. Working from the shadows with mysterious origins, we also meet Ryunosuke Akutagawa, mysterious member of Port Mafia who seems to have a history with Dazai. Other members introduced in the mafia also shows their ruthlessness and lack of care for human life such as terrorist bomber Momojiro Kaji. The point is that the show makes them the main antagonists for the first cour, an antithesis to what Atsushi believes in. At one point, he even meets a young girl known for the murder of 35 people yet still hopes there\u2019s some redemption for her.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, Bungou Stray Dogs is a cool looking show, literally. The characters portrays some unique personalities with their own personal powers. From tiger transformation to bringing objects into existence by just writing in a notebook, the show demonstrates the capability of attracting fan of supernatural fiction. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say that the mystery is very impressive. It\u2019s actually pretty straightforward although sparks quite the curiosity about characters\u2019 background stories. What I mean is more of the cases that is rather predictable and some of them actually feels repetitive by nature. \\n\\n\r\nBones helms the series and once again shows that they are capable of capturing the magic of supernatural genre. Character abilities not only looks cool but also decoratively presented in fashion that is extraordinary. Speaking of the characters, each of them has some unique appearance that makes them stand out in one way or another. From the carefree expressions of Dazai to the mischievous Akiko, it has something to offer for anyone. There\u2019s also a prominence of male characters with bishounen-like characteristics so female fans may find this series a nice sight to look at. The action speaks pretty much for itself with good amount of violence, choreography, and battle theatrics. I can also confess that most of the character expressions in the anime is done better than the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is a nice way to make the show more entertaining as well. From the OP song by Trash Candy to the battle OST, it gives the pleasure of what supernatural battles are all about. Character voice mannerism can also be praised especially for guys like Akutagawa\u2019s sinister tone or Daizai\u2019s sarcastic personality. Because the show is known for its catchy dialogues, the voice mannerism has to be portrayed with credibility and the voice actors/actresses does just that.\\n\\n\r\nIt is what it is. Bungou Stray Dogs is pretty much a show that can be watched by anyone from the beginning without any knowledge about literature. That being said, the comedy can feel like a bit of the hit or miss category. After the introductory episodes, the story does pick up quite a bit so patience is a key to enjoy the show. Luckily, there\u2019s an adequate amount of entertainment provided by the unique cast of characters, themes, and storytelling so be prepared for a wild ride. It\u2019s one that you\u2019ll someday come back and realize how fun it was.\\n",

            "content": "Before I settle into my oh-so-riveting review of Bungalow Stray Dogs, let\u2019s clear two things up.\r\n1. Atsushi got kicked out of an orphanage.\r\n2. Kyouka killed thirty-five people.\r\nI know this is a little confusing, but let me just break this down.\r\n1. Atsushi got kicked out of an orphanage.\r\n2. Kyouka killed thirty-five people.\r\nNow, let\u2019s move on.\r\nWhile Bungee was a pretty fun show to come back to week by week, it kinda overstayed its welcome. With some interesting ideas came a rather formulaic, and otherwise inconsistent plot, that was only held up so much by the surprisingly comedic nature of the anime, as well as the good productionvalues. Speaking of values, what is the value of 7 x 5? It\u2019s thirty-five, the amount of people Kyouka killed! She killed thirty-five people, everybody! WOW!\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked right off the bat is how Stray Dogs quickly reassures the audience that this isn\u2019t gonna be some edgefest. Atsushi gets kicked out of his orphanage (this is important, remember it) and a dark tone is set, but comedy kicks down the door by introducing Dazai after his failed attempt at suicide.\\n\\n\r\nYes, you read that correctly. A character\u2019s running gag is that he contemplates and even attempts suicide pretty much constantly. That\u2019s a thing and it\u2019s easy to accept.\\n\\n\r\nThen the love-hate relationship between the drowning fool and his partner, Kunikida, is established, a little bit of investigating and exposition later, and a small fight at the end perfectly label this as a mystery/crime action show with some good laughs and a few dark undertones. Is that what defines the following eleven episodes? Yes. But\u2026 not exactly in the optimal way.\\n\\n\r\nIn several places, the show seems to want to be a comedy more than anything, no matter what\u2019s going on. One episode is spent building up an intimidating enemy\u2026 only for them to be swiftly defeated. Off-screen. Wow. Or, a dark scene could potentially come up, like the middle of episode six, and immediately follow with Dazai goofing around in the office. Consistency is a little nice to have\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what IS consistent? The fact that Kyouka killed thirty-five people! It never changes! AND, Atsushi was kicked out of his orphanage!\\n\\n\r\nAnd even though I probably found this to be funnier than a lot of other people did, the comedy did get stale after a while. There are a lot of quirky characters and the art\u2019s shifting styles made it enjoyable for me, but after a while, you get the picture. It\u2019s generally the same jokes, the same gimmicks, especially since most of it is centered around Dazai. He\u2019s suicidal and loves women. Oh no, I probably spoiled like three entire episodes worth of material\u2026! And comedy in general is a huge hit-or-miss. Some are obviously gonna love it while others will hate it. If the first episode didn\u2019t get you interested, the rest will be a torturous gauntlet of strange humor.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, the conflicts in general are interesting, and the supernatural abilities of each character make for some good battles; most take a couple minutes, but some can be pretty long, as in, half an episode at least. The powers are pretty unique and suit their characters, either fitting their personality, or the general theme of the character. (All the characters and their powers relate to literature, most of it being Japanese.)\\n\\n\r\nBut one of the most frustrating things is the lack of involvement with the main character, Atsushi, who got kicked out of his orphanage. Sushi-man doesn\u2019t learn how to control his power until late in the series, and doesn\u2019t do so with training or anything, it just\u2026 happens. Before this, he almost never uses it at all\u2026 in fact, he has such little involvement with -anything- that one might question his role in the story. For the time being, he just gets dragged around by the agency he\u2019s in.\\n\\n\r\nPart of the reason for this lack of sushi is because, for some strange reason, Bongo\u2019s light novel spinoff, which focuses more on Kunikida, was adapted in the very middle. It\u2019s a very strange couple of filler episodes that turned me off pretty quickly. It feels weird that I\u2019m saying this to Studio Bones, but guys, there\u2019s a much better way to adapt this\u2026 it\u2019s called an OVA, and you put them after the series is finished.\\n\\n\r\nYou know who else is finished? The thirty-five people that Kyouka killed!\\n\\n\r\nAnd a little predictably, the first cour of Oingo Boingo ends with a very unceremonious episode, even though it had one of the best fights. While Stray Dogs was planned for a split-cour release from the beginning, it\u2019s not catered to that sort of release very well, given the nearly aimless first season. If this is supposed to be a preview, it\u2019s quite a long one, and the second cour has a lot of making up to do. \\n\\n\r\nSo, did you know that Atsushi got kicked out of his orphanage? Just a quick reminder on that, because that is indeed true. Bunko really wants to get this point across, for some reason, so they show the very same flashback of Atsushi getting kicked out of his orphanage whenever possible. I guess they just wanna repeat everything in this show a thousand times? Whatever. I feel like Atsushi could be interesting\u2026 being the self-insert that questions things that are happening and the people around them, he\u2019s a bit like an audience member, but not self-aware or witty in any way. Plus, he\u2019s the typical unconfident but powerful protagonist with an insanely OP ability that the bad guys wanna capture because they\u2019re bad guys. I think there\u2019s a lot that could\u2019ve been done with him, but instead, a mixed bag of \u201ceh\u201d was created.\\n\\n\r\nDazai, the not-so-desperately-needed comic relief of the anime, is definitely the most enjoyable character, at least until you get tired of his gimmick and his otherwise unbalanced personality. Here\u2019s a question, why does this guy always try to kill himself? And why is he happy about it? ...And why is he otherwise a serious character? Unlike Atsushi, who has room to develop, I think the author wrung out everything this character had and shaped him into a walking question mark.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, my favorite character became Kunikida, because his personality wasn\u2019t much of a gimmick and the laughs generated from him were often due to his interactions with others, specifically Dazai, who irritates him to no end. Plus, he has some super weird ideals and relationship goals. Whatever levitates your Gengar, man. He\u2019s a cool guy.\\n\\n\r\nShould I talk about the villains? Because aside from Mr. Edgy Bad Guy with the Rash, who ust comes off as a typical, edgy bad guy who tries his best to be intimidating and only does so for the first episode, villains just come and go with each episode. Pretty much everything they do is just kill a bunch of random passersby, because that\u2019s always sure to rev up the tension! ...Not.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, you\u2019ll meet Kyouka, who killed thirty-five people. ...This actually isn\u2019t repetitive beyond her introductory episode, I\u2019m just memeing you.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Bones crafted a predictably impressive-looking show, particularly with its gorgeous, vintage-themed character designs. My favorite aspect isn\u2019t their clothing, interestingly enough, but their diamond-shaped eyes. It\u2019s very simple but has a lot of character. They also do their best to keep the comedy alive by shifting the style to a simple, more cartoonish vibe which only animate between a couple frames and show some brilliant character faces and reactions.\\n\\n\r\nCoupled with this is a fantastic voice cast; @sushi is unfortunately weak with a rookie seiyuu, but superstars Hiroshi Kamiya and Mamoru Miyano knock it out of the fucking park as Ranpo and Dazai. They sound like they had a ball with their roles. The soundtrack, though, is just\u2026 weird. I didn\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s certainly an interesting bag of\u2026 well, all sorts of things, really. At one point, I heard a bunch of screeching and then some quiet rapping, if that\u2019s any indication. I like the OP, though. It\u2019s a pretty solid hard rock song with an interesting vocal hook and some great instrumentation. But the melancholic ED is even better, being a mellow track that transitions very well at the end of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, Bumble Stray Dogs is done for now, but will be back in the future. I\u2019ll come back to greet it again, because I do think the series has a lot of potential for improvement, but it needs to get the ball rolling fast, before Kyouka kills another thirty-five people and Atsushi gets kicked out of another orphanage.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nSound - 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10\\n\r\nPeople killed by Kyouka - 35/10\\n\r\nOverall - 5/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Kunikida\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 1\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium-high",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Due to a recent string of mysterious incidents involving a great, white tiger, Nakajima Atsushi (Uemura Yuto) is evicted from the orphanage that has served as his home his entire life. Left both homeless and penniless, Atsushi happens upon a drowning stranger whom he rescues from a nearby river. The man turns out to be Dazai Osamu (Miyano Mamoru) who, along with his partner, happens to be searching for the white tiger responsible for Atsushi\u2019s predicament. Dazai himself belongs to the Armed Detective Agency \u2013 a group of people possessing supernatural abilities that solve especially violentcrimes and combat underworld organizations. Following Dazai\u2019s lead, Atsushi is quickly entangled with the agency and the menacing Port Mafia as he struggles to find his place in the world.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs features a fairly small cast, comprised mostly of the various members of the Armed Detective Agency, the Port Mafia, and a few episodic characters besides. Perhaps the most key feature of the show\u2019s cast is that each character\u2019s name serves as some reference to a renowned author or poet with most of the references stemming from modern Japanese literature. This relationship between author and character is an ongoing element within the show and often certain personality traits or actions associated with the authors are exhibited by their respective characters in varying degrees.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this aspect of the show sounds both interesting and engaging the manner in which it manifests is very lackluster and sometimes even problematic. The actual depth of reference the characters pull from their real-life counterparts is very shallow with most characters simply borrowing their names with their abilities often titled after their author\u2019s most pervasive work. Beyond this the characters don\u2019t seem to have all that much depth to them and hardly borrow from their referenced authors in either a thematic or intelligent way. What could have been a complex and intricate parallel of ideologies and themes becomes no more than a slew of referenced names. My own familiarity with each author is incomplete and there are occasionally thematic parallels that arise however for the most part the show is quite shallow in how it pulls off this would-be-interesting characteristic.\\n\\n\r\nThough the actual depth of Bungou Stray Dogs\u2019 references is questionable, what issues arise within the show\u2019s cast lie with the characters themselves on an individual level. In terms of characterization and how the character fits into the show, Dazai Osamu is possibly the biggest offender. Whether it\u2019s his passion for attempting to kill himself over and over again and comically failing each time or his desire to find a partner for his ideal double suicide, Dazai presents an incredibly unappealing character. Beyond the fact that paralleling the real Dazai Osamu\u2019s relationship with suicide and its presence within his works by turning it into a poorly constructed gag is the height of insensitivity, the gag itself makes absolutely no sense. The very fact that a character is continually trying to kill themselves yet both fails to actually do so and will fight for their own self-preservation runs completely opposite of whatever poor characterization could be drawn out of Dazai\u2019s ridiculous character. In a number of ways, Dazai is representative of how the show handles its references \u2013 in a loose and often unintelligent way.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of the show, Nakajima Atsushi doesn\u2019t fare much better than Dazai in terms of characterization. From the beginning of the story it is quite clear that he has themes of rejection and belonging after being tossed out of his orphanage. He feels out of place wherever he goes and undeserving of anybody\u2019s interest or compassion. This is a decent start and he does develop over the course of the show, slowly coming to terms with his place within the agency and accepting his coworkers however this is not achieved without some hitches. For one, a certain flashback of his dismisal from the orphanage is often queued whenever the show attempts to discuss the themes surrounding Atsushi and its over-usage quickly becomes tiring. The same exact sequence plays multiple times an episode for more than half the series and its pervasiveness gives insight into the show\u2019s complete inability to characterize Atsushi outside of paralleling his predicament at hand with the scene in question.\\n\\n\r\nThough I\u2019ve highlighted Dazai and Atsushi specifically here, the rest of the cast isn\u2019t a whole lot better. Atsushi doesn\u2019t really play off of his coworkers at the agency as much as he predictably reacts to them in given gag scenarios. The Port Mafia, despite their initial introduction, is continuously undermined as an antagonistic enemy as their plans are foiled relatively easily which cuts the tension surrounding them considerably. And lastly, the show\u2019s cast is chronically over-involved. Bungou Stray Dogs tends to shy away from introducing new characters once each story gets rolling which causes the subsequent events to feel extraordinarily coincidental and predictable at times when the same characters keep wrapping around into relevance.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs\u2019 animation is perhaps its only worthwhile attribute. Though it fails in various ways elsewhere, the art style is crisp and unwavering while Bones presents beautifully animated action scene after action scene. The fight sequences are very high quality though they are actually rather sparse for the greater part of the show \u2013 growing far more frequent after around episode 8 and on. Despite its subject matter, a lot of the show features slapstick, physical comedy and various gags which utilize a slightly more cartoonish aesthetic. Though these gags still look good visually, they are rarely funny and often only serve to disrupt the scene at hand.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of Bungou Stray Dogs is fairly slow paced as it introduces the viewer to Atsushi, Dazai, and Kunikida as well as the existence of the Armed Detective Agency and their supernatural powers. It isn\u2019t a bad introductory episode but it doesn\u2019t present much of a hook into the show either. The shock comes with the arrival of the third episode as it features the show\u2019s first real action sequence. The episode as a whole is surprisingly bloody and ruthless despite the two proceeding episodes of mostly repeated gags between Atsushi and Dazai. This episode was actually a pretty good introduction into the brutality of the Port Mafia which would later be undermined repeatedly however its the show\u2019s earliest insight into Bungou Stray Dogs\u2019 biggest, critical problem.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the early introductory episodes, the show plays out in somewhat of an episodic fashion \u2013 featuring Atushi as he tries to find his place within the agency and one of the various detectives that work there as they team up to solve various mysteries and cases. There isn\u2019t much of an overarching plot though the Port Mafia\u2019s interest in abducting and selling Atsushi is a recurring part of the story for most of the show. The stand-alone episodes aren\u2019t terribly interesting and the featured mysteries leave a lot to be desired as their outcomes often felt predictable or coincidental.\\n\\n\r\nThe major failing of Bungou Stray Dogs is in how poorly it marries its two establishes tones as its subject matter involving murders and underground crime organizations clashes against its style of comedy giving way to very polarizing scenes. The show undercuts whatever real drama or tension it is able to conjure up with its rampant character gags. A police woman is shot in cold-blood and washed away by the river and her senior and subordinates are visibly torn up about it. Dazai then cuts into the scene, mourning the loss of her beauty and says she should have committed a double suicide with him instead. Not only does it continuously set precedent for generally tension-free scenes but it does so by utilizing the stupidest gag in the entire show. One second the show pokes fun at Kunikida\u2019s ideals and Dazai imbibes hallucinative mushrooms and the next moment people are being forcibly drowned, gassed to death, and killed as products of a black market organ trade.\\n\\n\r\nThe extremes are too huge and the comedy is too gag-oriented and dumb to allow for the viewer to take any of the more gruesome scenes seriously. The show tries wholeheartedly to be dramatic but completely fails due to its cast of primarily comedic characters who simply aren\u2019t capable of executing a serious moment either because of their exaggerated nature or comedic tendencies. \\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack didn\u2019t stand out to me very much and mostly served to reinforce the two prevalent atmospheres of the show. The music supported the show\u2019s comedy and action from the background without ever becoming too prominent or memorable itself.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nLooking at Bungou Stray Dogs  as a whole, I would warily say it has potential to be more than what it is. The show element of referencing various authors and imparting various attributes from them and their works into the characters is a very compelling idea at face-value and if it could make better thematic use of the technique I think it could yield very interesting results. With the next season already around the corner I have to wonder if perhaps the show would do better outside of the format of exploring individual members of the Armed Detective Agency each episode and instead attempted to tackle something a bit grander and more comprehensive. With these hopes in mind, the show has to find a place for its comedy and I think if it cut it entirely it would have a fair chance at becoming something worthwhile however I doubt this will come to pass.\\n\\n\r\nTo add a quick note about whether or not it\u2019s worthwhile to be familiar with the referenced stories and authors beforehand \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is much benefit to it currently. I was familiar with probably over half of the authors mentioned and a moderate amount of the literature alluded to and outside of a few shallow comparisons between characters and how the show aesthetically designed their abilities, there wasn\u2019t much extra benefit to the knowledge so I wouldn\u2019t urge prospective viewers to familiarize themselves unless they wanted to.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 4\\n\\n\r\nI gave Bungou Stray Dogs a 4 because its cast had either poor or uninteresting characterization, its story had a variety of problems, and it was very conflicted tonally causing. Its later action sequences and slight movement away from the rampant comedy of its earlier episodes improved its second half by a small margin along with the overall quality of its animation.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Bungou Stray Dogs for its action sequences and animation above all else. Though it has its fair share of narrative issues and a cast of problematic characters, its visuals are quite strong all throughout. I didn\u2019t enjoy the comedy of the show however one can tell whether or not it appeals to them by the time the first episode finishes.",

            "content": "\"Diverse & Versatile!\" \r\nWarning: Spoiler Alert. This review is filled with typographical and grammatical errors waiting to be criticized. Do not proceed if bothered. I have read many reviews about Bungou Stray Dogs that contradicts and compliments my opinion but I came to show mine.  I let my review speak for itself :) \r\n\u2022Tone/Mood:\r\nFirst, let us break down its tone and mood. Bungou Stray Dogs is one of a kind series that does not settle down to a numbered genres. If you already watched it, you might have noticed that it switches from different tones and variations. I do admit I admire it's shapeshifting.It may be shocking but I really found it <on point> and helpful. From a humurous communication styles to a serious, fatal & lethal negotiations, to even the characters' decisions based on the given situations and cases, the series takes you to a roller coaster ride without feeling nauseous but rather exciting, thrilling and unquestionably fascinating. Many animes may have had attempted to input several genres in a series but only a few succeeded in maintaining its spot and uniqueness. Surprisingly, Bungou Stray Dogs survived this dilemma. It can be confusing from another's point of view but it just simply wants to create a huge quality leaving the viewers hanging and wanting for more. It seeks alliance from various shades of flavor to generate a beautiful, decent, yet simple style. The tones are well balanced and if you pay attention to the series or manga, it isn't selfish for explanations. It is certainly its beauty that allows it to mix sorts of elements. If it weren't for it's limitless boundary, it would only be your typical clich\u00e9d mystery-tragedy anime that's forgettable in many aspect and worst case scenario, leaves you a boring impression. Its strategic goal of being diverse and versatile eventually became its assets to make it to the top shelf.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Some tones in the series/manga: \\n\r\n\u300eEntertaining, Mysterious, Serious, Humurous, Sympathetic, Secretive, Ambivalent, Scared, Hopeful, Excited, Sad, Pessimistic, Optimistic, Determined, Sentimental, Egotistical, Philosophical, Thoughtful, Informative, Comical, Nostalgic, Chaos, Impassioned\u300f\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Script/Plot/Arc\\n\r\nIndeed when it comes to exchange of words and arrangement of dialogues, the script is very well-written. Inheriting quotes and works of art characterized by the real-life authors are a very smart move of the mangaka. It isn't really distinctive using counterparts from the real world but it is a very artistic way pulling a series made up of literary motivated acts. For instance, the battle between Armed Detective Agency and Port Mafia involves heavily, dramatic, bloodbath, action, scene stirred by delicate, powerful, confrontational, self-reinforcing and logical lines of the characters. The humurous tag involved in the series isn't that hilarious but gives you a good laugh and rather a relief sigh that the characters can be dangerous but at the same time embarrassingly awkward. It balances well with the other elements considering its main genres. \\n\\n\r\nThe arcs are undeniably challenging and offer incentives such as \"the one who stays at the end will find the story very intriguing and enthralling\". Another example is The Guild Arc and Dazai's past (Both from Season 2), now we are alt+tab in a more serious environment. We see the comical mood fades into view as we are now more exposed of the darker side of the story. More and more villains are introduced and we see ourselves having trust issues. But still the series never really loses its foundation\u2014Diversity/Versatility. The emotions surrounding the different arcs are forsooth saturated and we are given a clear detail of the characters' principles and what and who they are or want to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some argues that it has no actual plot, but the constant fighting for justice and saving people lead us to crave for more (and it is still ongoing for both anime and manga). Moreover, the characters are believable and realistic when socializing, narrating and battling. I wouldn't mind telling you that the manga is doing better and better so I hope for more of Armed Detective Agency, Port Mafia and other known and unknown organizations in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the series by far did not disappoint when it comes to visualizing the characters' past and little backgrounds gathering the conclusion that its script opens opportunities for both the characters and the story plot to improve and grow better than its current state. Kudos for a very good written script!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Sounds & Cinematography:\\n\r\nBefore moving onto the characters, let's first take a look at its cinematography. Some series are totally saved by the animations or cameraworks. And Bungou Stray Dogs is not an exemption. Its cinematography is quite the philisophy of art. It uses various colors that implement different definitions. For example, brown and white are dominant when the mood is pretty stable and used in a normal conversation featuring Armed Detective Agency members. Red and black refers to Port Mafia's activities, positions, and abilities while Yellow and Green represents the power and theme of The Guild organization.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP from Seasons 1 and 2 have an excellent remarks to display. Every angle has different transitions that suits the mood of the video. The color matches the characters and the setting. It has accurate speed for actions, enough spoiler, good exposure time for the involved characters that make the viewers drop their jaws. It uses faded, darker filters and heavy amount of vignette expressing its action-mystery genre. The lightings and backgrounds prove its instagrammable status and shout aesthetics. The use of color neon green wallpapered the actions intelligently and highlights the important details that need attention. The sound is used esthetically organized by drums and electric guitars & such, (and of course Chuuya's voice yas!), Granrodeo and SCREEN Mode fearlessly gave it a wonderful performance. Trash Candy and Reason Living are your energetic and pretty catchy soundtracks you wouldn't miss whilst watching Bungou Stray Dogs.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the ending songs, compared to the opening songs, sit down to one filter for a feed. If you observe them, it focuses on blue and white colors maintaining the balance between peace and acceptance combined with dramatic lyrics of Luck Life's \"Namae wo Yobuyo\" and \"Kaze ga Fuku Machi\". The message brought by the songs are heavily filled with emotions and drives, and thus, obviously, can put you to tears. (IT IS SO TOUCHING THAT I PERSONALLY PUT IT IN MY PLAYLIST and play it everyday when I come to school). In other words, the ending songs are really, really heartwarming as the singers and the band delivered it beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up its sounds and cinematography, Bungou Stray Dogs states a perfect presentation, status, and position.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOut of all the areas I'm assessing, Bungou Stray Dogs' characters are its triumph card. From being <Gifted> and having an incredible ability to bringing life to the famous authors and their works, Asagiri has executed his characters very well. Their visuals and arts are highly clean and decent from the costumes they wear and the weapons they use. Despite introducing numerous characters from different arcs, I personally believe that everyone of them had made enough screen time and allowed the viewers and readers to adore and determine who they are. Though some of them has longer amount of exposure, it borrows us distance to recall the newest and recent characters. For example, taking the time of your life indulging the Anne of Abyssal Red ability, Rashomon, Beast Beneath the Moonlight, No Longer Human, Thou Shalt Not Die, Undefeated by the Rain, or Ultra Deduction, you'll find yourself being enchanted by other amazing abilities such as Perfect Crime, Dangai, The Great Old Ones, or Crime and Punishment.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Protagonist: \\n\r\nThe MC is kind, sentimental and genuinely cares for others because of his traumatic past that promotes us the benefit-of-the-doubt to hold on to his story longer as he proves himself he isn't just \"good-for-nothing\" to the readers and viewers. His repeated torture scenes and deja vus from his past is forgivable considering teenagers are frequently fragile. Believe it or not, it's kind of impressing because Atsushi represents millenials' moodswings and treacherous decisions. I really, really like the way Asagiri describes Atsushi. He deserves to be a protagonist despite the fact that Dazai had one of the best screen time and story. I believe this is because of his relatable past and personality.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Supporting Characters and Antagonist/s:\\n\r\nFrom my perspective, the villains as well as the side characters acted their roles the way the story wants them to and I did not feel any annoying overpowered (which is sometimes exhausting) aura among them. Each has their own SWOT Analysis\u2014 Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, which is really marvelous and wonderful. In the case of Dazai's ability, it is proven in both manga and anime that he is the most powerful among ability users but is weak in comes of physical combat and other aspect. On account of that he only temporarily nullifies ability when he touches the target. (Still, I love Dazai!)\\n\\n\r\nI hereby announce that Bungou Stray Dogs is proven... GUILTY for being ambitious and versatile, collaborating such concepts that are admirable and therefore successfully creating a well-desired product that will secure its sustained competitive advantage.\\n\\n\r\nSO STAN LEGENDS, STAN BUNGOU STRAY DOGS!",

            "content": "Written by Kafka Asagiri, illustrated by Sango Harukawa and under Bones studio, Bungou Stray Dogs, an anime filled with supernatural action has totally made it for bring us cool characters and several unpredictable elements through it episode one by one. What can I say? I just sit and watch it with \u201cgood hopes\u201d about the anime and believe it or not that hopes really fulfilled at the end. Although, the good hopes I mention in here not all of em are answered by this season, there are several reasons why I give 7 (seven) for this despite the fact of my desire to give itan eight (I wish I could but still my final whole score is 7 (seven)). Well, why the score is 7 (seven) not 8 (eight)? I\u2019ll explain it further below.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Story\\n\r\nCenters on several people who are gifted with supernatural powers and how they use them to do some various activities, for an example like the main characters did for a living as a member of association named Armed Detective Agency. The activities started from problem solving through some cases, catching culprit to bomb disposal. Well, sounds too much? Nope! Because both the writer and the director has succeed to deliver that package directly to the audience without side issue of little importance at the first. I certainly have to admire the creators for not throwing much garbage in the beginning though there\u2019s some episode not fully whole action. But, I liked the story idea very much. I think this kind of story could be a favorite for an anime fans who like an action genre. I don\u2019t recommend this anime to a fans that like full action without background story. Cause this anime show some short explanation about character\u2019s point of view and cases through several event and condition for approximately 24 (twenty four) minutes each of episode. I felt that kind of short but whatever, I still watch the anime though.\\n\\n\r\nFor the beginning of the story, I admit it that I quite confused about how the story started. Suddenly, there\u2019s an orphan who complaining in the side of long river about himself after terrible event happened to him. What I confused at that time is that, what kind of action story that the writer want to show with those kind of start? Will it be like an amazing superhero action, an extraordinary magic action or maybe a \u201cboring\u201d one? I added the \u201cboring\u201d one because I thought the good visual is trick from the creators so we can\u2019t denied to watch it. But, after I watched the end of first episode to third episode I\u2019m sorry that I ever thought about this anime that way. Cause especially from the third episode the story suddenly twist into cool and awesome action with little surprise essence from the characters that existed. Indeed, I have to disappointed that near the end  the creators still add the introduction one of character which I thought it doesn\u2019t need to. But again, as a matter of fact it well received and paid in the end of the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nI love the creator\u2019s idea to make this story not so serious, added by some little dramatized comedy that makes me giggles several times. For an example like in second episode when one of the main characters got stuck in a barrel for a reason that awkardly ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think for this season the creators did a story focus to introduce the main and the villain caharacters, not focus to main or ideal conflict to it climax or anti climax of the story yet. There\u2019s still a lot of homework for the creators or I\u2019d rather say there\u2019s event that need more to explain and that includes the past of the story and the impact of them to the characters, villain\u2019s true intention, and many other secret that important to known by the audience. And for that, I\u2019m just glad to realize there\u2019s second season for this show.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Art\\n\r\nI love how the creators draw the characters uniquely. My favorite of all is Nakajima Atsushi\u2019s design. I actually didn\u2019t like that type of character but I don\u2019t know, I mean I loved the hair (to me it\u2019s like modern style of fashionista), love from the clothes to the black boots he wore too. And I like the design of Dr. Yosano too. Black short hair decorated with a medium butterfly hairpin, white collar shirt with long black tie, black skirt, black stocking and high heels. Both the design definetely worked to plus the aura of each character and helped improve the personality of the characters. And that condition apply to other characters too, all of the the main and the villains. They made the characters are memorable to the audience and they are different one to another.\\n\\n\r\nThe art background is realistic enough. I liked the opening when Dazai fall from a high-buiding by the way. It looked cool despite the fact when his body touch the ground, he will be dead. Fortunately, that kind of event did not exist haha. Well, back to the background, I think that the creator already did best for them. Like places (from side of the river to big shipboard) and the action event that got more intense the longer you watched. The design of character, the background and the story fits and blend to one another. It is a very good job.                      \\n\\n\\n\r\n(*) Sound\\n\r\nMy first confession about this section is that I fallen in love with the ending song. Though through picture of the ending you can see that such event doesn\u2019t existed to the story yet but the song hits the feel. I definetely will keep it in my track list of anime songs and hearing it again and again. For the opening, I guess that fits well to it scene and has rising the air of the battle scene.\\n\\n\r\nFor seiyuu part, I think they all have succeed to portrayed their character\u2019s personality. Like several examples, first Uemura Yuto has made it to show how unconfidence Atsushi sometimes whenever he try to do something out of his imagination and afraid others see him as an annoying one that made them hate him till they want to ask Atsushi to get out of their sight. He started with a weak light voice but in some condition when Atsushi believe in himself, Uemura\u2019s voice could change. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, that too happened with Dazai who portrayed by Mamoru Miyano that famous and known with his character voice on Yagami Light\u2019s Death Note. He could make a line between when Dazai teasing or playing around with each other and a side when he get a serious one. It definetely improved the seiyuu cause he has succeed to present Dazai differently than other character he has already portray. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for the third example, don\u2019t forget Akutagawa who voiced by Ono Kensho. I\u2019ve knew that Ono Kensho often portray a character that have soft side or I\u2019d rather say the good one. But in this anime, (wow) it certainly showed that Ono Kensho have a wide ability to \u201cmisdirect\u201d his voice into heavy and sounded bad and evil at the same time. I admit it that I was shocked when I realize who is the voice actor of Akutagawa and he unpredictably is Ono Kensho. They did a very good job with this section.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Character\\n\r\nIf the creators have wanted the character of this anime to remember by people who watch it (especially in Japan), then they have made it. First, it because there\u2019s creativity and path that the creators have gives to this anime. And that creativity is to name almost main and villain character from famous literary author\u2019s name in Japan. Which I found that is the brilliant idea to make the introduction of the character more simple and memorable. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, the design all of the characters they have made are unique (include their supernatural power) and their personality too. Well, you will find a character that looked weak in the beginning and suddenly he could do something out of beyond and our imagination, you will find a character that looked dumb but have a strong supernatural power, the one who looked innocent but deadful, the one who looked calm but knows everything or the one who looked elegant but in the end get scary as well. You will find many different and unique charactesr in it. My suggestion to describe them all is that, \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nDespite of two good points I mentioned above, there\u2019s still some shortage though. I have realized that for solution to several conflict that one of the main character through is too simple and fast. Realisticly, that could not happened just for a moment like that, but I\u2019m still happy that after the solution, the next event get surprising feel for the audience. That moment happened for at least one or two times. Luckily, it didn\u2019t broke how slow or the fast story pace is. \\n\\n\r\nNext, as I have explained in the story section that there\u2019s some event that need more description or explanation. It relate to this character section which I realize that there\u2019s character\u2019s emotion changing drastically in one event and the problem is I don\u2019t see any causes or reasons that have been explain previously. Actually, this kind of problem often happened too in other anime that have season per season cross apart. And I don\u2019t blame for the author, the director or any other who\u2019s in it, cause \u201crole\u201d in story will get worked perfectly if you understand the personality of the character, from background story to how \u201cthe role\u201d through his or her life in the story. It needs hardwork and it is difficult. Seiyuu in here have role to portray \u201cthe existed role\u201d and they have to work together with both the author and the director. If one of them get messed up then \u201cthe role\u201d itself could get even messier. I think they have to work this part even more for the next season or project ahead.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last part is that the existence of several supporting character (I\u2019m talking about the characters beside the main characters and that includes villains too). There\u2019s several character who get \u201cshadowed\u201d by the other main characters. Actually, it because the story not so focuses on them till comes feeling that I don\u2019t give a crap about what\u2019s gonna happen to them. You will see there\u2019s some poping up character suddenly in the end of final episode. But, the problem is not the sudden poping and I don\u2019t put a conflict about the character that showed up in the last minute. I am actually bothered by some main villain\u2019s character which I found cool at the beginning but \u201creally less-cool\u201d at the end. And for the worse, they have already existed indeed but their role is so small. If i put those character\u2019s existence into percentage, you will find a big hole depends on the main\u2019s role. They are indeed have role to one condition but that condition doesn\u2019t stay for very long, just a little time (like sponsors or something). I tell you, it could make the audience forgot about them. Luckily, their character\u2019s design is easy to remember but I have to tell you again I already forgot their name after I finished watching the last episode.  I still did not know how the creators want to put them in the next season. I hoped their percentage of existence will rise up, not drowning to the ground.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Enjoyment\\n\r\nWatching this flowing from the first episode to the last episode just like that. I have to admit that I still have enjoyed watching it though there\u2019s some lackness I mentioned above section per section. Cause the genre that I thought would be heavy, it turns out to be lightier than I ever expected. Plus the comedy from this anime is awkward (I mean rare) but I still giggles and some time laughing cause of it. You may predict several that could happened, but between your guess, you will get surprised and amazed by the characters even more. For the continue, just watch the next season for seek that answer further. In all, I would like to say that Bungou Stray Dogs is recommended for all of you who likes an action anime genre with not so heavy story.      \\n",

I also love the cross-literary references that get all tangled up but somehow stay connected (even though I wish they weren't so western-focused). \r\nBut I think what really makes this show great is the way it touches on a range emotions that often stay below the surface. In particular, concepts related to the fear/comfort of aloneness, not an uncommon theme in general. This show dives right in, opening a conceptual conversation aboutwithout resolving it, leaving the task up to the watcher. Somehow it has a very nostalgic feel.",

Most members of the Agency wield their own unique, supernatural ability, and together they make a mighty force to combat the mafia. Also, only one of them is an actual detective.\r\nNow that I\u2019ve filled you in on the basic plot of the show, let\u2019s get right to the heart of the matter. Bungo Stray Dogs is, at times, a mess. Through a series of awful setups that only lead to decent and sometimes good payoffs, Bungo Stray Dogs shows itsinability to make a plausible plot with understandable or compelling villains. Its tone is completely unbalanced, the motivations of its protagonists are often over-explained while still remaining nonsensical, and to top it off, its main character is a total Mary Sue. Whatever there is to like about this show melts away by the time the season reaches its halfway point, and only somewhat returns to form for its finale.\\n\\n\r\nThe plotting of individual arcs in this show have been utterly atrocious. While the payoffs are enjoyable, consisting of clever twists and decent one-liners, the setups for these aforementioned payoffs range from pathetic to completely ludicrous. A fine example would be from an early episode, when a client leads some of the Agency into an alleyway. That\u2019s it. They followed a woman into an alleyway and it turned out to be a trap. Not even like a pitfall trap or something. She just pulls out a submachine gun and starts blasting away. And it doesn\u2019t really get better than that.  \\n\\n\r\nTonally, Bungo Stray Dogs seemed to have its footing for a brief second before slipping on a banana peel and falling off a cliff. The wit and comedic timing seen in the first few episode completely evaporates and leaves us with silly chibi faces for no good reason at times not fit for any comedic relief. It\u2019s almost as if the show is desperately trying to make sure it\u2019s not taking itself too seriously, and by doing so only makes it harder for me to enjoy watching. There is a time for humor and there is a time for being toned down and real, and Bungo Stray Dogs has a hard time differentiating between the two. \\n\\n\r\nVillains can be likeable. I\u2019d argue that on some level, they should be likeable/relatable. Without that, we just have an object that only exists to be detested. In Bungo Stray Dogs, that object is Port Mafia. A heinous and ostentatious group of delinquents with quite a heavy reliance on brute force and explosives. Their main goal is to capture the Blue Tiger for reasons completely undenounced to the audience. Other than that, they just do evil things on a daily basis for no apparent reason. They\u2019re as one-dimensional as it gets, and the good guys aren\u2019t much better.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the Agency? What do they stand for? How do they and Port Mafia both exist without one destroying the other? All of these questions and more aren\u2019t answered very well, if at all. Their motivation should be simple: To protect and serve. You know, just like the normal law enforcement. Instead they find themselves looking for motivation on trivial things such as: Why should they rescue their kidnapped teammate, and so on. Every moment spent in their office feels like a waste of time, something to fill up the episode\u2019s timeslot before they get to the actual point. Every character in the Agency seems to have a lackadaisical approach when it comes to their job, as if the greater good isn\u2019t enough to motivate them. In this regard, they\u2019re actually somewhat more unlikeable than the villains. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the main character, Atsushi is an orphan. You would know that by watching any single episode in the entire series. It\u2019s apparently integral to his very being, something not to be overlooked, and so there\u2019s a flashback of Atsushi in an orphanage that reoccurs throughout the whole season. It never changes or adds anything new to his character aside from the very first time it is shown. He is an orphan, he has been told he is a waste of space, and he kind of believes it himself. I guess it could be argued that it is an important part of his character, but even so it\u2019s not nearly important enough to bear such incessant repeating. Oh, and as I said early, Atsushi is a Mary Sue. Somewhere along the lines he masters his uncontrollable powers. There\u2019s no episode to explain this, nor is there even a quick training montage. Atsushi goes from having absolutely no control to holding his own in a 1v1 with the most dangerous villain introduced so far. \\n\\n\r\nThe Good\\n\\n\r\nAt its best, Bungo Stray Dogs is a fun action series that had a strong start and seemingly interesting characters. It managed to pull off some nicely timed twists and one-liners, despite the basic setups that hold it back in the long run. The characters also have some neat historical context for fans of Japanese literature.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad\\n\\n\r\nAt its worst, Bungo Stray Dogs is a poorly cobbled together setup for its second season, of which I am not excited for. The cast seems interesting and enjoyable when first introduced, but that fades away with every second spent with them. The villains are un-relatable garbage people with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and the heroes are not much better. The amount of time wasted on the protagonists acting silly and squabbling in their generic office setting would have been better spent filling in the plot holes and leaps in logic that are all too abundant in this series.",

            "content": "Bungou Stray dogs\r\nWhen i watched the first 2 episodes of this anime i had really really big expectations about it but in the middle of the series it kinda went down. Here\u2019s why:\r\nStory 7/10:\r\nHonestly the plot is really interesting and the fact that the names of the characters are actual authors and that the name of their powers are the names of the books they made It\u2019s something unique for me and I really liked that. The problem is that as I watched the first episodes I expected mystery and action and what I got was A LOT of comedy. This show is like 30%action and mystery and 70% comedy, this weird combination kinda works out but it\u2019s absolutely not what I expected. At some points the story became nonsense and predictable but besides that I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nI really liked the animation, probably the part i liked the most of this anime. It\u2019s very detailed and the action scenes are well done. I also want a moment to appreciate atsushi\u2019s eyes, they are by far the most beautiful and hypnotizing eyes I\u2019ve ever seen in any anime.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is average as well as the opening, nothing special BUT I have to say the ending is BEAUTIFUL!! It became one of my favorite endings of all time. The voice acting is pretty good and I also heard some new good voices. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10:\\n\r\nThe characters are lovable and cute, I liked the design and as I said before they are based on real authors and that\u2019s something really cool for me, but we had almost no character development and at times I felt the characters kinda bland but hopefully we get to know them better in season two.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment 7/10:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime and I looked forward to every week\u2019s new episode, even tho it wasn\u2019t what I expected I had fun watching it. If you like comedy and a little bit of mystery and supernatural powers give BSD a try. \\n",

The eyes, they are just one of the best things about this anime\u2019s art style. It\u2019s very original and soooo pretty. All the characters were designed so well, it suited perfect with the character\u2019s personality.\r\nThe voice actors? Did a good job, honestly Ihaven\u2019t watched an anime with bad voice actors I mean they suited the character and that all I can say right?\\n\\n\r\nNow the anime is totally worth watching if your into action/comedy/mystery/slice of life and a little bit of blood then I recommend giving it a try. I laughed through the whole series, it is even funny at moments when it really shouldn\u2019t be.\\n\r\nIt did had plot armor, but I think they did a good job to not make that too obvious.\\n\\n\r\nI am so excited for the season 2, cuz in season 1 they introduced us to all the characters and got us into the story. So I hope in season 2 that they will be giving us the rest of the story. The sad part is that the main protagonist didn\u2019t master his transformation but I hope he will in season 2.\\n\r\nI loved that the anime actually focused on all the characters and not just on the main protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe titled of this anime was brilliant too, you\u2019ll know why if you watched the whole series, it actually has a meaning behind it. \\n\r\nAnother things is the first episode, I mean that first episode will leave a really impact your view on that anime. It really got me excited for what was going to happen, curious for the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think it was a great anime, and as I said excited for S2\\n\r\nThis review was probably very random an unorganized that\u2019s cuz I am writing this real late at night\u2026\\n\r\nBut yeah hope that  this was helpful to some of u guys !! xxx\\n",

            "content": "I ended up getting so tired of hearing Atsushi's flashbacks about his orphanage days...\"oh wow, they slapped you and said you were worthless\", its not like you repeated the VERY SAME SCENE FOUR TIMES IN THE PAST 10 MINUTES!!!!\r\nSmall nuances aside, it was a very enjoyable show. Although I didn't really understand the character's inspirations until reading some other review's, I didn't feel that was necessary background in order to understand each character. The comedy, although at times misplaced, was good, and I laughed (or snickered) at most of the gags. Having one episode dedicated to explaining each Agency member was nice, although I wouldhave preferred to see more of three things:\\n\r\n1. Dazai being Dazai\\n\r\n2. Dazai's backstory\\n\r\n3. Dazai's obsession with double suicide (it's not really a spoiler is it?)\\n\r\nBasically what I'm trying to say is that he was the most complex, interesting, and misused comedic relief character in the show. An episode or two dedicated to Dazai's history with ******** (number of asterisks is random, don't bother counting) would have been entertaining, perhaps instead of the Mafia secretary episode.\\n\r\nTo be honest, I skipped the OP every time. On the other hand, the ED was slow, sad, and a good ending to each episode.\\n\r\nVisuals made up 86% of the BSD's comedy in my opinion. Chibi drawings make everything funnier and Studio Bones made good use of that, along with a good splattering of decent jokes, to keep me entertained.\\n\r\nI'll conclude by saying that Dazai is best girl.",

            "content": "With another season of anime, comes another supernatural-action title that attempts to be unique, different and original while keeping faithful to its genre. Bungo Stray Dogs (BSD, from now on) is most definitely unique arguably ingenious, but has several, painful shortcomings that unfortunately add it to the vast collection of mediocre supernatural-action anime. \r\nBefore anyone watches this anime, I highly recommend you watch The Canipa Effect\u2019s great video on the characters of Bungo Stray Dogs. You will appreciate the ingenuity of the story and understand the characters better once you learn about the Japanese literarians they\u2019re based on. \r\nSTORY: Quickly said, BSD is a poorlytold good story. As I mentioned previously, the premise of writing the main characters and their \u201cgifts\u201d based on famous Japanese literarians is ingenious, and due to the limited cultural awareness of the non-Japanese watchers on MAL, this ingenuity has unfortunately gone unnoticed and unpraised. One must be culturally aware of the Japanese literature references in order to fully appreciate the anime\u2019s story, but sadly even so, it remains poorly told. While basing characters on famous literarians is certainly original and unique, it has its drawbacks and limitations. The main characters in BSD all have unique, supernatural abilities (called \u201cgifts\u201d), and these abilities are denominated after their respective literarian\u2019s most famous works. For example, Osamu Dazai\u2019s ability is named after his literarian counterpart\u2019s book, \u201cNo Longer Human\u201d. This is where problems begin to arise. Due to the vagueness and obscurity of these ability names, several characters have gifts that are inexplicably overpowered and one can only wonder the weaknesses and limitations of said power. The majority of gifts in the show are so powerful that they almost always bend the rules of the show\u2019s universe, and this results in several plot holes during fights when characters conveniently seem to forget how insanely overpowered their gifts are. The source of the gifts is not explained once, and several abilities are explained with convoluted logic that is hard to digest.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the show is extremely typical, the protagonist (Atsushi) is down on his luck and saves a drowning man (Dazai) who was actually trying to kill himself. Dazai and Atsushi are then tracked down by the upstanding, strict supporting character (Kunikida) who is then forced to treat Atsushi to a meal. Attach an unnecessary amount of slapstick comedy and you can already you can see where this show is sort of going, and while the beginning is typical and cliche there\u2019s nothing really wrong with it. The execution of it was pretty good and as a result came off as a funny way to introduce the characters. By the end of the first episode, Atsushi is recruited to the Detective Agency, which is a legal police force where they only recruit members with the supernatural gifts aforementioned. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot progression of BSD is driven by several plot contrivances and conveniences, and the source material was adapted in such an odd way that there end up being around 4-6 episodes centered around a bomb and 3 of these are back to back. This results in a tiring, unpleasant and repetitive watch that honestly lost my interest several times. The slapstick comedy in the show was especially annoying and often ruined the tone of several serious scenes. The comedy was often unoriginal and quickly grew repetitive and annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe main antagonist group of the show is the Port Mafia, and if you are to believe that they are going to be the biggest, toughest forces the Detective Agency are going to face you are dead wrong. The Port Mafia is often portrayed as an ever present overwhelming power that threatens the safety of all the civilians and detectives in the city, but in reality, are basically a rival, evil counterpart to the Detective Agency. Several members of the Port Mafia come off as incompetent and weak and sometimes you wonder if they really live up to the dangerous threat that they\u2019re often portrayed as. Towards the end of the series you are briefly introduced to a flurry of characters that are very clearly the true, underlying antagonists of the show and they are much, much more interesting than the main antagonist of this season, Akutagawa. It seems what anyone should take from this season is that it is building a foundation for what is to come this fall, and I would say they\u2019ve successfully (although slowly, boringly and sometimes poorly), built a strong foundation. Hopefully next season uses this foundation to their advantage and is able to be much better.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all not to say that BSD is not an enjoyable watch. As I mentioned, BSD is a poorly told good story, leaving the plot to have a few profound and several unpredictable moments that caught me off guard in a good way. The concept behind each character\u2019s gifts and the main antagonist of the show was enough to keep me invested while it was airing and I can honestly say that I enjoyed this show\u2019s run and I\u2019m excited for the next season. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: BSD has been renewed for a second cour this fall, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that several of the other supporting characters will be developed next season. But for now, most of the characters in BSD are pretty dimensionless and some are just plain stupid. Atsushi and Kunikida are the only characters developed over the course of the show, while the rest are simply background characters. Atsushi is your run off the mill protagonist; a little cowardly, strong-willed, naturally talented and offers a naive perspective due to a lack of experience. At first his backstory was handled maturely, sad yet not quite melodramatic. That is of course until they repeatedly flash back to one scene from Atsushi\u2019s orphanage every single episode. This show brutally beats you over the head with Atsushi's orphanage backstory to the point where it often breaks tense moments out of repetitiveness. \\n\\n\r\nOsamu Dazai is arguably a Gary Stu (No Longer Human ability, hello!?) and that\u2019s perfectly fine and often fitting for his role as Atsushi's \u201csavior\u201d. Dazai is Atsushi's role-model and is what he strives to be a detective from the Agency, and it had (or has, maybe the second season will do this) potential to be an interesting and complex relationship. However, for most of the show the interactions are between Kunikida and Atsushi, as Kunikida is often left in charge of him. Their character dynamics are quite interesting especially considering that they are great foils. Kunikida is studious, prideful and driven by his ideals. Atsushi is often weak hearted, modest, and is driven by his desire to be a human worthy of life. Their conversations and interactions are funny and often very profound.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAUDIOVISUALS: Produced by Studio Bones, the animation of BSD is excellent. The fight scenes are animated with great colours along with great fighting choreography. Some of the character abilities are inherently boring and as a result usually make up for some boring fights, but they are nonetheless animated beautifully. Kept me at the edge of my seat and greatly anticipating several badass action scenes due to the immersiveness of its animation. BSD also has a great opening that gets you hyped for the show every time you watch it, and a great ED that is often extended to the final scenes of several episodes for dramatic effect (similar to JoJo\u2019s roundabout ending extending). All in all a well animated show with very few boring panning frames. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: Despite my qualms with the show it kept me invested for the most part and I enjoyed watching it. I was excited for every episode when it aired and I readily await the second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10: The show is not bad, but not necessarily good. The quality of the story and characters is very mediocre and all the supernatural abilities could have been the shows saving grace but end up being poorly explained and ridiculously overpowered. I\u2019d recommend this show to anyone who isn\u2019t overly picky and unnecessarily analytical and simply prefers to be entertained by their anime.\\n",

            "content": "The story's really good and I like how it progresses. It can surprise you at times but it can also be kinda predictable when you take a closer look at things...or just consider what the most shocking outcome would be. Anyway, the episodes are a bit episodic. I'm ok with this though since, as a detective agency, they have to handle lots of different things. There's also one thing that can be seen as repetitive...and that's Atsushi's backstory. They basically show the same scene every few episodes and sometimes more than once each episode. This may be their way of showing us that the memoryplagues him but I still can't blame anyone who gets bothered by seeing the same thing over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are very quirky and it's usually their quirkiness that leads to the comedic moments. Despite this, there isn't much development. Kunikida and Atsushi may have gotten a bit though. Overall, they're consistent and (I guess) have character arcs.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I like it a lot. The eyes are unique and I especially love Atsushi's. The pupils also tend to have a diamond like shape which isn't something you see very much in anime. (Or at least I haven't.) The character designs are cool as well. When it comes to seeing their abilities or \"gifts\" in action, they're usually very aesthetically pleasing. And the animation's good. From what I recall, there isn't a single scene that felt weird to look at. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is awesome. It has a cool opening song and a nice, relaxing ending song. It's like the opening gets you ready to be thrown into the story while the ending allows you to chill after everything that's happened. The voice actors are good as well. I especially like Dazai's voice actor and how he sounds when he's serious and being comical. The soundtrack is pretty good and adds to the fight scenes a lot. It's honestly good enough to go back and listen to the entire thing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, I think it's safe to say that Bungou Stray Dogs is a pretty good anime. Matter of fact, it's one of the best action comedies I've seen in a while! Because of this, it deserves a 10 overall.",

Seriously these guys are so strong like nobody can even do anything to them. They're against the mafia and others but damn they're so strong. And this show had a lot of badass characters with cool powers. They're not your standard ki blasts or whatever but pretty cool stuff. This show is pretty funny though and comedy might be one of it's best traits. And Dazai is the best. His power can neutralize any power and he's always messing with everyone andhe's just a lowkey badass. lol. There's a lot of powers in this show it's like watchin freakin X-men. The action scenes are good, the comedy is great and the cast is just full of badass and funny people. Give this show a watch if you like good action and comedy.",

            "content": "If Naruto and 91 Days were to have a child, Bungou Stray Dogs would definitely be their one true child. \r\nBungou Stray Dogs delves into the world of mafia and supernatural powers, which is rarely seen in the industry, the closest the anime that resembles those features would be like Mushishi, which enjoyed notable success.\r\nThe plot is engaging with very little dead moments, bar the first episode which took a while to fully captivate me into the series. Foreshadowing was brilliantly utilised giving the storyline a better depth that entices the viewers to ponder and think of what is going to happen next. In termsof complexity, there actually aren\u2019t many plot twists or intricate moments for the viewers to decipher. As such, the plotline is pretty much one-track, but manages to capture attention of the audience with its high-paced action and modernised effects. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the main character, it is a bummer. Rather weak and boring. Not only that, the protagonist powers are pretty shit as well, being able to transform into a cat (tiger actually) which is a joke compared to the side characters. The sole reason I was able to rate the \u2018characters\u2019 criteria a 7 is due to the supporting cast of the anime. Characters like Dazai and Rampo had much better context and abilities while also possesses unique characteristics which makes these characters more likeable as opposed to Atsushi which has no direction and willpower without the aid of the Agency. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the grounding of the characters past, abilities and personalities are well-written. The writer doesn\u2019t simply slap information into the audiences face with no proper explanation. Abilities, personalities and characters backgrounds are decently explained with very little plot holes to criticise. \\n\\n\r\nConclusively, Bungou Stray Dogs might not give the audience a intricate and mind-blowing story, but what it does best is that it keeps the audience\u2019s attention in check. Many anime have tried going with plot that consists of difficult and obscure plot under the pretence of being \u2018deep\u2019, but instead backfired on them. Bungiu Stray Dogs despite being a genre that involves detectives and crime-solving, used a much simpler and direct route when conveying their message which was a pleasant touch (at least for me). \\n",

The story is pretty interesting, so if you might like the combination of genres 'Action, Comedy, Mystery, Seinen, Supernatural', then you won't be disappointed. Altough i would call this show a Shounen rather than a Seinen (the factthat characters are working adults instead of being highschoolers doesn't make a series a seinen imo). The comedy is at most places pretty juvenile and won't make you laugh out loud most of the times, however it should reduce the distance between you and the characters\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe animation/art isn't extraordinary nor anything new , however it doesn't fall short in comparison to other shows of the season. I also liked the character designes of most of the characters (especially Kyouka's).\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nI don't recall any ost from the show that i loved, it was ok though. The opening and ending did not catch my ear all that much either. However the music does work well with everything that happens on the screen and will make you more involved with the action, so i can say it's good.\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nI liked them, simple as that. Dazai & Kunikida duo is pretty damn entertaining to watch, other main characters are pretty interesting as well, i surely hope i will get to know them better in the next season of the show.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nGot nothing to say in the subject, simply seems like a cool show to watch.\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nThe show is interesting and fun to watch, it's a strong position among this season's anime, deserving to be in top 5 in popularity ranking of the season.\\n\\n\r\nTo summ up, it's a show worth watching, you will surely enjoy it, if the humor dosn't end up irritating you or scaring you away.

Yet I still gave it a try.\r\nIt was just some sort of typical mystery and assassination/ gang like anime. With a naive main character and over scheming supporting character. What I love of this anime is the humor added by the characters themselves. \r\nBungu Stray Dogs is about how decisions can save lives and powers can be a double sided blades.  It revolves around a story of an orphan, Nakajima Atsushi, who was kicked out the orphanage he was in after the dreadful attack of a weretiger on thelivestock of that orphanage. Weeks later of hunger and homelessness, his tracks brought him to Yokahama City where his life changed after meeting the suicidal maniac, Dazai Osamu, a profound member of the Armd Detective Agency, an agency consisting of beings with supernatural powers whose task was to investigate cases beyond the powers of ordinary human. Dazai saved him from his dreadful fate after knowing that he was that weretiger and asked him join the agency. Atsushi is a character with an awesome and irritating self pity character and throughout the series, he needed to fight it off. He felt that he was a useless human with a power that can destroy anything-- and kill any lives. \\n\\n\r\nWith Dazai and other members of the Agency to guide him, he realized that his power was beyond what he thought it was. Rather than kill, he used his weretiger power to protect the people of the city which changed his fate forever. He was also targeted by the large organizations who thought of his power of greatest use and if he would not be that strong enough to use his ability, the city would fall because of him. \\n\\n\r\nI like this anime and I watched it repeatedly after that. I love the seemingly flawless character of Dazai and stoic and nerve wrecking attitude of Kunikida,  and how their partnership works in different situations. I am also looking forward of what would Dazai do to let 2 of his known students furnished their skills and relationship to defeat what Dazai ought to be the omen and greatest disaster in the story. \\n\\n\r\nOne may try to watch it and see for themselves.

This is what I like anime for. \r\nI'm actually quite a fan of literature. I love japanese literature, so I anticipated something entirely else - what would feel like Aoi Bungaku series but remastered/deconstructed. But I liked what I saw. Generic shounen low-key aimed for fujoshis - ain't it the important piece of that a n i m e core, that attracts so many otherwise different in age and nation people? And as huge plus, great voice acting, great visuals, OP&ED that you won'tskip.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it. Don't expect much from this anime (unless you've already seen it and loved and here just to read a bit more ab' BSD). It isn't unique. Nor consistent. Not like those sci-fi/drama/psychology titles elitists are suckers for (tho i'm a sucker 2). It's not a chef d'oeuvre. It's simply entertaining. Which is, imo, the most important quality of a popular media product.\\n\\n\r\n/7 for sound cause great VA&Op&Ed but BGM isn't impressive at all, as it wasn't present.\\n\r\n/7 for story cause it's pretty generic, but not too cliche\\n\r\n/9 for art - eye-candy but also generic\\n\r\n/10 for characters. so many hazbandos~ <3 Dazai <3<3 Akutagawa <3\\n\r\n/10 pure enjoyment\\n\r\n/8 overall cause very good product but, well, not a piece of art\\n\\n\r\n//if anyone notices wrong usage of articles pls PM me <3",

HOWEVER, for some reason, I kinda liked it more than the other shounen animes I've seen. I can't quite explain it, maybe it's the reference to several literary geniuses? Maybe it was the art and music? Or maybe the side characters (though quite a lot) were interesting? Maybe I found the humor cute? I'm not so sure, but I DID LOVE IT.\r\nIdidn't drop it (lie I did to the other animes of the season) because even if the MC was sort of generic, there were others who really stood out. It also helped a lot that the OSTs are amazing. \\n",

The character has almost zero control of his powers at first, but somehow becomes really adept at using them. He's also just about invincible so I never really worry about him... Ever. Every situation, ever hit, every little thing that happens to him you think to yourself \"Ugh, he'll be fine.\"\r\nNot only that, but it's yet another \"Random company full of super powered people.\" It feels dry, and it tastes dry, and honestly I think it goes a couple episodes too long.\r\nHowever, the show does one thing reallyright. NO LOVE INTEREST. We don't need it, and this show knows that! Oh thank goodness. That can't be all though, right? I just said a bunch of bad things about it, and yet I gave it an alright score, so what's up with that? Honestly, for such a fair story, it builds everything up really well. Excluding the last few episodes it's pacing is on point, and it is genuinely interesting to see how everyones abilities work with or against one another. Especially one character who doesn't seem that interested in living, but is still trying his best to help everyone he can. Also, the action in this show is really well done, and fun to watch. This anime came to do one thing, and that thing was to be fun to watch. Even though it has faults, it manages to work past these and still manage to be fun.",

            "content": "Heavy Spoilers\r\nExcept, there isn't really much story to follow anyways... so I'm not really spoiling anything. All the enjoyment comes from Dazai. Dazai ichiban delicious.\r\nStory; \r\nThe whole premise of the anime is very good, the set up is nice and the first episode makes you feel engaged. However, after the first episode the story begins to get a little messy and there are too many different elements/themes/ideas that are being shoved into the anime. Essentially, the anime began as a supernatural, comedy, action, overcome your past and learn new things, etc. type of anime. The set up is very typical, but what sold it wasthe characters; their quirks, backgrounds, and the mystery of their personalities/relationships.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then all of a sudden (across the period of a few episodes), the anime turns into the detective genre. I guess I gave it a pass as -spoiler- he joins a 'detective agency' with all the other 'gifted' people. But this is exactly what made the story a lot less coherent and enjoyable than it could have been. Instead of the story prioritising on helping the main protagonist learn about himself and to master control over his tiger transformation, the focus remains on random arcs, which don't actually progress the story too much. The only premise that remains constant (after a few episodes of random genre jumping), is that Atsushi is the weretiger and he's being hunted because he's very valuable. And this doesn't really make any sense cause it comes out of nowhere as well, and the 'dangerous' man he's told to avoid turns into a Team Rocket vs Ash type scenario where, at the end of each episode he appears in, he's essentially done nothing.\\n\\n\r\nOh yea and they stole a bunch of random things that were meant to be 'WOW DIDN'T THINK OF THAT!! haha u got mi animay riter!!' except it just came off as kinda cringe. Like when someone makes something cool/funny/inspirational and other people try to copy it??? yea like that. like omg cpt murica jumped on grenade 2 save teammates lets make him a super american!!! yea, well atsushu jumps on a bomb but it was actually a test as well and they decide to accept him.\\n\\n\r\nTo be completely honest the storyline was so messy in terms of genre that I don't even really remember what happened. The main reason I wanted to write this review was because:\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nThe art was delicious. His haircut on the otherhand... I mean, the fella isn't an orphan anymore okay, at least ditch the bad haircut. No offence to kids at orphanages, cause they probably have more stylish haircuts than him. THAT RANDOM BANG JUST ANNOYED THE SASDIUHASIUDH out of me holy coaofaasasf. Just no. Get a different 'I'm the main protagonist of this anime' haircut please.\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\r\nWhat can I say, the OP and ED were delicious too. Didn't find anything unusual about the FX and VO's either so yea.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nLegit the only reason I was still entertained and decided to finish the anime was because of Dazai. Like the whole premise of trying to suicide was like... oh my i know what's going to happen... \\n\r\n-some edgy loser kid with depression is going to get triggered somewhere and rate the anime 1/10 for being insensitive- \\n\r\nDazai was your typical comedy relief guy who's actually opop. Oh yea and the main character... which literally no one gives a sdafj about cause he's just trash. This is also why I have to deduct a point for characters as well. Atsushi is such a aewifaoi. His character development was typical, but then you have all the negatives. This is also why I rated the story so bad. His 'gift' he transforms into opop regen tiger under moonlight. But all of a sudden he can turn into a tiger whenever he wants and he just learns how to control it randomly. And I guess the writers realised and were like oh.... let's just make him say, \"I still don't have control over it...\" at the end of the anime. Hopefully no one overlooks the fact that all of a sudden he's able to randomly transform his limbs into the tiger form???????? ppl r nut dum 0k animay riter-san, we r smurt, we kan folo plot dsentlee 0k.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\n- Dazai\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\r\n- Dazai gets his own anime in the next season!!!\\n\r\n- I rated this 8/10 for development of Dazai's character for the next season.\\n\r\nWOOOOH\\n\r\n-Atsushi is trash- WOO!!!\\n\r\nAlso Atsushi just reminds me of like 'old man' in Korean so... I'll take away extra points from Atsushi. No one likes him. Atsushi should listen to his orphanage parents. If you don't already see it, I dislike Atsushi.\\n\\n\r\nIt's kinda like Clannad/Angel Beats. The first half of it is so boring you just don't want to continue. But then plot twist it's all a set up for the better half (the second season)",

            "content": "Nakajima Atsushi was expelled from the orphanage where he resided, without being explained why. Without prejudices, not even form of subsistence alone, Atsushi wanders dying and starving to save Dazai from drowning. The fateful encounter radically changes the life of the young homeless man, engulfing him in a fantastic and supernatural world.\r\nThe story revolves around a private detective agency, made up of researchers specializing in diverse areas and empowered to live up to its status. However, this narrative line is not the focal point of the story, serving only as a link to a main line: a relationship of the members with a Port Mafia.\r\nBungouStray Dogs gives the slayer a fun and interesting mix of drama, comedy, mystery and action. The concept of the series is quite interesting, even if it is something repetitive and much worked in the universe of Japanese animation, it manages to be pleasant and exploited from an unusual point of view within the context.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not a dramatic play at its core. There was a clear attempt to make it something more dramatic by highlighting the protagonist's squeamish past, however, the connection to that was not happy with the rest comic storyline. It's an entertaining series with a dose of mystery right for us to see without undue commitment. That is, although it is a work of demography within elements too strong emotional points of view, getting by the bloodiest look.\\n\\n\r\nThe demographics helped to reduce censorship, allowing the public to enjoy the full of beautiful battle choreography, shootings and murders. The Bones studio continues to do a good job, so in addition to the dazzling scenes, one of the strengths of the animation, maintained an average fluidity. Nothing is extraordinary from the technical point of view, however, nor can we point out blatant errors in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nThe photography and the plans of photos have great moments, especially in the climax of the episodes. Whether it was in the \"liberation of power\", in the battles or when solving some mystery, an animation could make us drool for more.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design was the best of the season. It is strong, with gaudy and striking nuclei that are distinguished from other productions. The visual is careful and a harmony achieved between animation, character drawing and acting voice is simply in the right measure.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack varied between rhythms with jazz and electronic traits. It remained original in its production and not generally well placed. The opening and closing themes deserve special mention, being particularly very good.\\n\\n\r\nAs expectations for Bungou Stray Dogs appeared to be high. Like every piece of art, an attention and a critical eye on the same intensity, and the judgments overwhelm on all sides. Of course it is not an ideal work, let alone something representative of the genre. However, it can be regarded as a pleasant work of entertainment to watch any kind of expectation, for those who want to laugh while watching a universe shrouded in mystery with interesting characters and fantastic powers. In addition, this series is full of literary references (as characters represent an author and name of their powers over their respective literary works), so for any lover of literature, especially Japanese, or enjoyment is intensified.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, for those looking for a more \"dark\" work from an emotional and narrative point of view, this will not be the best choice. It has drama, but poorly explored and above all poorly placed, so I suggest you not start Bungou Stray Dogs to desire a dramatic complexity of quality",

            "content": "Literature Greats turned Superhuman Investigators\r\nBungou Stray Dogs is by large a character analysis piece with literature greats with superpower going to a huge civil gang wars...and the way LA said it, it's actually a great premise, however...\r\nThe plot does tend have small short arcs concerning the investigator's firm's quirky wacky members but as well as Atsushi voiced by Yuto Uemura, Doppo Kunikida voiced by Yoshimasa Hosoya and Osamu Dazai's look at society of their world. Dazai is by the far the most interesting character out of the bunch and his background is told in little snippets giving us his \"true\" self, Doppo's look at societyas a theme is one of the best looks at the corrupted and unfair world that they live in and Atsushi is the realist in all this and probably the most developed characters from the the wimpy, spineless main protagonist to someone who holds his beliefs of his world of peace in high regard, even if it means he needs to dirty his hands to do it.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately aside from those three characters, the other support characters at best get one episode with the main protagonist with little to string them together aside being \"support\" to Doppo, Atsushi and Dazai with their superpowers. The best connection most of the support characters and minor villains are their connection to their real life literary counterparts and their theming makes them intriguing one-off characters (well most of the villains anyways). LA's favourite character would actually be Atsushi as his character development quite surprised LA to the point of calling him a badass, bouns points for Atsusuhi being an audience surrogate making us relate more to himin his world even more. The only other character LA grown a liking to was Kyouka Izumi voiced by Sumire Moroboshi, reason being her backstory, her being a badass and once her appearance and \"arc\" happened she(*SPOILERS* not only gave Atsusuhi that push from wimp to badass but gave herself character evolution too!) got something of equal share of screentime with Atsushi.\\n\\n\r\nThere is comedic bouts in this anime and really it comes off as a mood whiplash at best especially concerning Dazai's attempted suicides. The comedy does work if it's character jabs or banter but the comedy just doesn't mesh with the very serious plot aside from \"cooling down period\" before getting back into the action.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by Studio Bones is by in large largely reminiscent to Soul Eater right down to the comedic moments to the highly detailed battle scenes. The animation is highly commendable with no animation derps. LA had no problems with the animation and should praise Bones for the gorgeous animation.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was anything at fault in Bungou Stray Dogs that would have to be that the anime's pacing is very slow at first (in order to get used the setting and main cast) but just because it's slow doesn't mean it has a benefit, that being it develops the huge roster of characters at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries with this anime however are intriguing and does bring plot twists nonchalantly as possible even giving some of the mysteries answer the whole \"red herring supernatural cause but actually not\" take on it, which is unique giving us something of vibe to the world Atsushi lives in, the plot twists does it's thing by giving more developments outside of the cast (one episode be damned).\\n\\n\r\nConsidering this is the first season and the next season will be released by Fall 2016, this anime's \"story\" is just getting started however LA will see what the first season did and to be frank, besides the mood whiplash comedy the very slow start, Bungou Stray Dogs, gave us a world of literary greats with superpowers, a brewing civil gang wars and a then wimpy spineless main protagonist turned badass and the main plotline thread still looming. LA would like to continue watching Bungou Stray Dogs only to see what happens next as it left us hanging on a cliffhanger by the finale.",

            "content": "When it comes to studio specialties, Bones is definitely one of those companies who specializes in creating story-based action and excels at doing so, being one of the companies with a relatively consistent track record on the quality of their work in this genre.  So, in comparison to Fullmetal alchemist, Soul Eater, Noragami, and Hitsugi no Chaika, how does their newest adaptation, Bungou Stray Dogs stack up?\r\nStory: Atsushi is...a very unfortunate individual.  After being thrown out of his orphanage because they needed to cut costs and so that they would have one less mouth to feed, he is left homeless, penniless, and virtuallyleft to the vultures due to having nothing to eat for a good many days.  After contemplating suicide, he finds a man just dangling in the river he's sitting next to and decides to save him out of the goodness of his heart, only to try and rob him later.  This man named Dazai is an agent for the Armed Detective Agency, a group of individuals with special powers who act sort of like a special police force for the city and solve cases for various events and going-ons in the city.  And with Atsushi being one of these 'special power' wielders, he is taken in by the Agency to then be thrusted into what sums up to be a mob fight in the city.  \\n\\n\r\nBungou stray dogs, or Straydogs as I'll be calling this show for the rest of the review, runs on an arcic setup where every few episodes runs with a certain storyline that progressively moves the story forward.  What makes this so beneficial to the story is the fact that the show manages to fulfill a lot of the criteria that is needed in order to aid the audience in knowing what is going on.  Every new story provides movement so the anime never loses momentum, each arc focuses on a specific character in the story that also provides a bit of development to their character, and there is always an aftereffect so that the story will then continue to pick up its pace.  Additionally, there're always more comical moments where the characters show less serious and wacky sides to themselves that adds more to the character and qualities of these characters.  (Also, the action is really well done.  Classic gunfights and street brawls were very visually appealing.)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Straydogs does have a few bugs in the mix.  The first of which is with the comedy, where the transition from comedic to serious and vice versa are sometimes extremely choppy and doesn't really flow all that well.  And the second, and biggest problem of Straydogs is Atsushi's backstory.  The show consistently in every arc reminds you that Atsushi was a thrown out orphan, even having a dedicated 2-3 minute scene of Atsushi's internal thoughts that details his internal struggle with finding a place in the world.  And they use this WAY too often.  It's fine that the show expresses Atsushi's internal struggle, but the show hammers it in a bit too much to the point that I was shouting at my screen saying \"I get it!  Atsushi was abandoned and thrown out for being unwanted.  Jesus, let's get back to the gunfights and street brawls already!\"  Every arc has some portion of it dedicated to this aspect of our main protagonist and while it does diminish as the series goes on, and Atsushi does grow as a character, they still do it regardless where in the series we're in and it's just a bit annoying.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Straydogs's story is more or less just a lead-in to the second season coming in the Fall.  The series excels at having the classic gang-like setting with the Agency's rival, the 'Port Mafia' acting as the main antagonist for the series and uses this setting to its advantage by having its mini-arcs feature some gritty and well developed stories that impact our characters with every new episode.  Aside from the constant usage of Atsushi's background information, the story didn't really have many flaws.  It wasn't exactly an extremely compelling story, but it was still enjoyable nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good use of setting\\n\r\n+ Episodes were more or less a perfect blend of both character and story development\\n\r\n-  Kinda leaves us hanging with the ending (Cause hey look, Season 2)\\n\r\n-  Overuse of Atsushi's orphan backstory\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters of Straydogs are actually quite...interesting.  Every single character who has powers has a very unique name for their respective powers, where each character that the series shows us is a reference to a different novel that exists in the world that depends on the character's nationality.  That being said, onto the analyzations.\\n\\n\r\nAtsushi Nakajima is the main character of Bungou Stray Dogs with the power 'Beast beneath the Moonlight' (A reference to The Moon over the Mountain) who has the ability to turn into a white tiger.  That's...basically all he can do.  Of course he gets added physical ability when he goes tiger but in a nutshell, he turns into a tiger.  Anyway, Atsushi serves as the 'new kid on the block' kind of character as he, like the audience, gets introduced to his coworkers at the Agency and every few episodes or so while also being thrown into various situations that show him the kind of cruel reality the world is.  As mentioned before, his backstory is that he was thrown out of an orphanage (is me repeating this starting to get annoying yet?) and more or less left on the streets to die.  As the series progresses, you can see Atsushi's constant self-victimization die down with every new case he's involved in, which while is more or less a plot device to keep the series going, is nice to see cause it moves his character along and helps him grow with every new case that does get progressively harder with every new situation.  The issue I see with Atsushi's character is not with his character himself, but with what he does to the people he's against.  The entire series tells us that everyone and I mean EVERYONE wants Atsushi cause he's so special or he's so good.  This sparks so reasonable rage to some of the other 'main' antagonists to the story that sorta just want to see him drop dead.  My problem with this is because literally everyone he fights has basically the same reason for hating him specifically, it just sorta feels hollow.  \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Osamu Dazai, who has the ability 'No longer human' (a reference to an actual japanese novel called 'No Longer Human') who can negate any ability with a single touch.  Dazai is...an interesting individual.  His character is that of an overzealous person who finds it his duty to commit suicide, but only the most graceful or beautiful suicide, before promptly deciding that he wants to commit a double suicide with a beautiful woman too.  Safe to say, Dazai serves as not only Atsushi's main mentor in the series, but also as the series' comic relief while possessing a decently cunning and intelligent individual underneath.  Despite being one of the more core characters in the series due to his role in the series and his backstory, there really just isn't much to say about Dazai.  He's more or less just...there, and really doesn't add a whole lot to the series' plotline as a whole.  Sure he has his moments, but compared to other characters, he's just not as important story-wise.\\n\\n\r\nThen there're the other characters in the series.  Because of the way the series structures itself, these characters aren't necessarily background or side characters, but rather characters that belong to different factions.  As such, I'll be going them by faction.\\n\\n\r\nThe Armed Detective Agency has quite a...colorful cast.  By colorful, I mean REALLY...WEIRD.   As the main faction of characters that we follow, these are the characters that we follow the most.  Each story arc has Atsushi follow or learn from one or more of the Agency members where we get to know them a little more as characters with the arcs that they are involved with as well as understand their sense of humor cause this group of strange individuals definitely have a lot of different kinds of funny bones.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the Port Mafia, the most prominent antagonist in this season.  Believing in strength and to use their powers to get what they want, the Port Mafia acts as your stereotypical gang group with lots and lots of murderous intent.  Does that mean they're generic?  No.  The series focuses on a select few members of the Port Mafia for a few episodes and/or focuses on their members (Akutagawa specifically) during certain arc in the series.  While their lack of screentime due to the main brunt of the series focusing on the Agency members kinda hampers on knowing everything about how this organization works, there certainly is a great deal of information that the series was about to give us about our antagonist characters that only helped to serve the series.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have The Guild, the third and final faction that only appears in the last few episodes in the series.  Because of Season 2, this faction and its agents were only revealed at the very end of the series so there really isn't much to go off of.  But hey, they seemed interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters of Straydogs were while interesting, have a very...clear flaw to them.  At least to me.  I for the life of me cannot remember at least 90% of the cast.  The show has a lot of characters that they throw into the spotlight during certain arcs and moments in time, and while they are all enjoyable and quite memorable as characters, the show doesn't really do a good job at hammering in their names so, at least for me, I cannot recall many of their names.  (Maybe it's due to the fact that I don't read enough to constitute me knowing the authors that these characters reference...)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Colorful and diverse cast\\n\r\n+ Character development\\n\r\n-  Atsushi is sort of a plot device for some characters\\n\r\n-  I cannot remember most of their names despite knowing more or less everything else about them\\n\\n\r\nArt: The direction that Bones took for this series is leaning towards a sort of dulled out color scheme and simple yet crisp and concise look on the animation.  The majority of the color scheme is either beige or various colors of white and such.  There's no real pop to the color and is pretty monotone to give this sorta big city sort of look.  (And while I say it's monotone, the muted color scheme actually helps give off that gang-filled city feel.)\\n\\n\r\nThe action for the series is pretty fluid and the street brawls and such are only elevated by the various powers and abilities that the character wield and use.  As the series takes heavy inspiration from various books and novels, the series uses a series of rings with text on them to dictate the usage of a power or not.  Effects like these and many other involving the usage of powers make the street brawls even more visually appealing to look at and improved the look of the series overall.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Dulled color scheme that fit with the series's setting\\n\r\n+ Fluid action\\n\r\n+ Good effects to bring more life into the action sequences\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The OP known as 'Trash Candy' (Weird name, I know) is an rock song that brings a loud and rambunctious tone akin to the city and action theme that the series brings a lot of throughout its entire runtime while the ED, \"Namae wo Yobu yo\" is a mellow and quiet slow rock piece that pertains more to the metal thoughts and internal conflict with the characters in the series.  Both tracks fit with different aspects to the series and are very well made.  Despite that, these tracks don't...really resonate with me personally.  They're good, don't get me wrong, but just personally, I just don't find these songs to be memorable or worth listening to in my down time unlike a lot of other tracks.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good OST\\n\r\n-  Not really memorable (to me)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Bones gave me a show a few seasons ago that I absolutely despised.  That show was called Concrete Revolutio.  Because of that, I was actually scared to watch this show because of how similar of a concept that series had with this one.  Nevertheless, my friends tried to convince me that it was nothing like that trash pile and that I would actually see more worth in this series than that one.  So, after finishing this show, I can safely say, dear god they were right.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nTo say I loved this anime is...a bit overstating it.  This show really isn't the kind of thing I like all too much, but I definitely did enjoy it.  It was consistently interesting and I always appreciate an excessive amount of real life references even if I myself don't get/know of them.  Also, I really like Kyouka.  She's adorable.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nMy one and only complaint with this series was how much they drove in the fact that Atsushi or other characters were abandoned by something or someone and were taken in by one of the three factions.  Like seriously, there are an excessive amount of characters that were just recruited off the streets.  It makes sense to have similar backstories so some character can relate to each other, but when you have 3 or more characters like that, well now that's just being a bit excessive, especially with the amount of screentime the show was dedicating just to make sure that you knew that Atsushi was thrown out by the orphanage.  (If I'm saying that too much, the series uses the same 2-3 minute scene at least 5-8 times in the series alone.  Just think about it, about 1/2 episode's worth of screentime is the exact same scene.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a series that's about gangs and/or gang-related stuff than this series might fit the bill.  The show is largely story-based so there's not a shortage of interesting stuff happening on-screen, and there're enough comedic moments and serious moments to create a good and reasonable balance on both tones of the show.  Overall, Bungou Stray Dogs was a good show that delivered mostly on what it wanted to do.  With a second season coming, the sort of 'read the manga' ending feel doesn't really have any shortcomings as there will be more animated material coming soon, so it also does will in that aspect too.",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that the show was just as bad as the twists that it had. \r\nThe basic premise of the anime is about a group of people with superpowers who solve crimes and help the police. Well, solve is kind of an overstatement, they just have the answer by the end of episode. The logic just doesn't matter nor does evidence. Talking about the story it followed a simple and overused episodic story A along with a main arc story B. The episodic story each had a twist in the end in which the client always turned out to be the culprit.This trope happened in all the episodes. No matter how tough the crime by end of 20 mins all they had to do was to accuse the client and come up with even ridiculous story as an explanation. The only reason I completed the show was because I thought the bigger picture looked interesting, though it too was just like old wine in new glass. Overall, don't expect anything from the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought that the story was bad, then characters can only be labelled as worse. There was nothing distinguishing about the characters, they all followed the basic shonen troupes. They were all just a caricatures of basic shonen troupes. There wasn't much of character development, things just happened because someone either yelled at you or someone balanced your shortcomings with their powers. People gained control or discovered extensions of their powers mid battle that helped them to win. Also, no characters had a ulterior motives or ambitions or just anything that fuels a human, they just existed. \\n\\n\r\nThe humor in this anime was so badly placed. It was more forced than the twists. All of the serious moments that could have been a major source for character development was followed by a humor that was neither funny nor a place for it to exist. Bad is just a understatement for the humor. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that I liked a lot was the fact the way the superpowers. How they used it was bad but the powers in itself was unique and imaginative. Though the fight scenes were nasty. There was usual hand movements followed by hero getting beaten up, followed by Dazai coming up with a plan (cannot  call it a plan in reality), and then hero beating him up. I literally could not imagine how the author used such great powers so poorly. \\n\\n\r\nBoth art and sound were something I enjoyed in the anime and probably their only saving grace. Both opening and the ending were immensely enjoyable to me. The art suffered here and there and there were some screens of bad animation bu they were minor inconveniences . The character designs were of good quality and the background too were detailed. Overall there shouldn't be anything to complain about in here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was disappointing and had nothing new to offer. This anime just follows the long list of anime that used Naruto and the other popular shonen as its role model and blatantly copied it. The story, character, action, and especially the humor were all atrocious. The only good thing was art and sound, though do not expect anything groundbreaking from it too.",

The story was great with its good, balanced pacing and great character developement. I LOVED the art style to it. I felt it was unique as it has those types of references that can actually teach you things. I did find the slight plot armor a bit annoying in the series, but it was insignificant compared to the excitement in the actual story. I would strongly recomment this anime to many viewers who aren't annoyed by abit of plot armor.",

But finally, I started the series and really it was worth it!\r\nIt tells a comedic, exciting and well-plotted story of people, who have supernatural abilities. You know that's the industry is full of supernatural series, but this is easily one of the best of the whole bunch. It is really special and beautiful series that deserves a spot on my favorites. Every character feels so alive with their creative past andabilities. And there's a lot, I mean A LOT of characters to choose from. Some of the characters relationships and past are twisted and related to each other. And there is even jokes and weird humor put into the episodes! How much can this anime do in only twenty minutes?\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course I recommend it. I was truly an outstanding supernatural & mystery series.",

            "content": "Bungou Stray Dogs was an anime I was really excited for, for reasons that weren\u2019t really much. I saw the first PV and just the animations and music alone sold me. I didn\u2019t need to know anything else. After watching the first episode though, well, I have mixed initial reactions. It was a lot more lighthearted than I expected\u2026 a lot more. And at first, I had quite a lot of issues in getting used to its tonal shifts. As the series went on, I started to accept both its tone and content. And by the end, I did enjoy the series. Bungou Stray Dogsdoes a lot of things right, in sacrifice for some other qualities. The PVs and key visuals might be misleading with the tone, but the genres aren\u2019t, so you will get what you\u2019ve wanted, just not as much as you\u2019ve wanted.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs is about a homeless boy who meet a suicide-loving supernatural detective who makes the boy join his supernatural investigation agency. Yeah, that basically sums it up, though it may not sound too interesting for some. But the series manages to have quite an interesting main story once the mafia aspect gets introduced. The thing is that it\u2019s only interesting when the main story is present. Throughout most of this season, it was mainly episodic supernatural cases that weren\u2019t too enjoyable. They ruined the flow of the series and it\u2019s quite disappointing. And many of these stories were anime-original, so they had no reason to be here. However, when the main story kicks in, it kicks in hard. It\u2019s a very entertaining story about detectives vs. mafias and it manages to be very thrilling\u2026 unless if the comedy ruins it (which I\u2019ll talk about later). The story is left incomplete and it ends off at a cliffhanger. This would have been a flaw if a second season wasn\u2019t announced (luckily it\u2019s a split-cour series).\\n\r\nStory: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs gets a lot of things right, but a lot of things wrong too. The world building in this series is fantastic, as right off the bat, this supernatural, mafia filled world feels believable for some reason. The characters are also presented and introduced nicely, as the series gives adequate development for all of their characters. The series is very stylish and the setting is interesting too. And the fact that all the main characters are named after famous Japanese authors is both weird and enthralling. But the thing Bungou Stray Dogs doesn\u2019t get right is its tone and pacing. Both make the series suffer heavily. The series is a mixture of both comedy and drama, but the mixture isn\u2019t pure enough. Bungou is more relish than ketchup in terms of its mixture. The transition between seriousness to humor to back to seriousness is very off-putting at times. One second the characters will discuss a murder incident, the next second a character will make a joke about committing suicide. The series feels all over the place with its tonal shifts. Secondly, the pacing heavily suffers whenever the main story is put on hold and episodic stories come in. Not much really happens in these 12 episodes. If only the series was a loyal adaptation of the manga.\\n\r\nPresentation: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs has quite a unique set of characters. For many they may end up being likable from the first episode, for others it may take some time, and for some, they may end up not liking them at all. It only took me a second to like the characters in Bungou. Our protagonist, Atsushi, is a very likable main character. He has and interesting power of becoming a tiger spirit and it\u2019s fun seeing his reaction to the other eccentric detectives. And though it may not seem like it at first, but he can be a badass when necessary. He is more than just a pretty face. However, his backstory on why he had to leave his orphanage felt quite weak, though luckily they don\u2019t focus on that too much. Our deuteragonist, Dazai, ended up being my favorite character. He\u2019s character is a good mixture of humor and badass-ness. His committing suicide gag always ended up being funny, even during the umpteenth time. And we have other interesting detectives such as, Edogawa, Kunikida, Miyazawa, Tanizaki and Yosano, whom all are interesting and unique, even if a couple of them borrow some clich\u00e9 traits. The antagonist of this series, so far, aren\u2019t quite as interesting as the main cast, but they still have another season to shine. \\n\r\nCharacter: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nIt\u2019s really damn pretty, no other way to say it. The lighting, the coloring, the neatness, all amazing. Never was there a drop in detailing. It\u2019s Bones at its best. The character designs are great too. Some may call it fujoshi-bait, but pretty-looking boys doesn\u2019t make the series deserve that title. The backgrounds are pretty too. And those sunsets are absolutely gorgeous. However, whenever a comedic situation happens, the art intentionally looks simplistic and characters are drawn chibi-type. It\u2019s drawn well, but it makes a bad contrast with its more realistic arc. And the simplistic art makes the tonal shift look even more jarring. It almost feels like I\u2019m watching two different anime. Other than the simplistic art, the normal art is gorgeous and is a good competitor for art of the season. \\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nJust like its art, Bungou Stray Dogs features great animation too. It\u2019s probably one of the most fluid anime of the season, and it might be better than Bones\u2019s other work from the same season, Boku no Hero Academia (in terms of consistency). Character animations looks superb and the backgrounds are well animated too, especially the wind effects. And during the action moments, the animations look even better and even more fluid. The animations during the chibi/comedic moments are more simplified and it matches the context. It\u2019s just that the comedy itself is a little out-of-place. If there\u2019s nothing you can enjoy from Bungou, at least you have great animations to satisfy you. \\n\r\nAnimation: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast is considerably well-known in Bungou Stray Dogs, and they all do well. Atsushi\u2019s voiced by one of the lesser-known seiyuu, Uemura Yuto, and he does considerably well considering his experience. He manages to do both the lighthearted and the serious moments properly. Saying that Miyano Mamoru didn\u2019t deliver as Dazai is like saying Death Note isn\u2019t the most popular anime of MAL \u2013 It\u2019s factually incorrect. Miyano does everything right with Dazai. His humor is on point as it always makes me laugh and his serious moments are fantastic too. His range in his voice is extraordinary and there\u2019s not surprised why he\u2019s loved as a seiyuu so much. And talking about talented seiyuu, Kamiya Hiroshi does Edogawa, and he does it excellently too. However, his character has primarily been in comedic situations, so this anime doesn\u2019t showcase his talent of doing more serious roles, but he still gets the comic timing right. And Kunikida is done well by Hosoya Yoshimasa, as he manages to capture the character\u2019s strict and serious character properly. And you have other talented seiyuu doing supporting roles like Ono Kensho, Sakurai Takahiro, Hanazawa Kana, and Ishikawa Kaito, who all go a good job. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe thing that made me excited for Bungou Stray Dogs before its premiere was the music. It was good enough for me to quickly put the anime on my \u201cplan-to-watch\u201d list. First of all, Iwasaki Taku is a very talented music composer as he\u2019s done so many well-known tracks for well-known anime. Bungou\u2019s music is an extra addition to his ever-growing list of success. The background music in the series is phenomenal. Some of the jazzy tracks always gets my attention, and the way they are used in the anime, especially during the action scenes, it makes things so much better. Just listen to the music in the first PV and I dare you telling me that it doesn\u2019t sound sexy. The OP, \u201cTrash Candy\u201d, is alright. Personally, it\u2019s not my type of music, but it\u2019s listenable. The music for it is pretty upbeat. The ED, \u201cNamae wo Yobu yo\u201d, is far better as both the vocals and the music is soothing, and it matches the anime too. \\n\r\nMusic: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t enjoy Bungou Stray Dogs as much as I wanted too, due to some noticeable flaws, but there are some things that are done so well that it\u2019s hard not to like it. The premise is interesting and the main plot is great, but whenever the main plot is put on hold for some episodic moments, my enjoyment is put on hold too. And due to large tonal shifts throughout the series, sometimes I feel like I\u2019m being taken away from the moment. Due to tone shifts, comedy moments don\u2019t feel as funny as they should and serious moments lack the punch it needs. But the characters are likable enough for me to get past those issue and still consider this a good series.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Bungou Stray Dogs is something you should check out for sure. Though it may be a seinen anime, it\u2019s fan base is primarily female based (and it may be due to obvious reasons). Don\u2019t go into this anime with really high expectations because it\u2019s not too special of an anime. And don\u2019t expect the series to be serious focused, because it might just have more comedy than most of the anime from this season. The tonal shifts in the series might be off-putting for some, and it might be the biggest flaw for those who\u2019ve dropped the series. But the characters are likable, and most importantly, memorable, and the story (finally) seems like it\u2019s going somewhere. Though it would have been unforgivable that the series focused on its main story so late, but since the series is a split-cour, it\u2019s hard to complain about it that much. Can\u2019t wait to see how the second season turns out to be. \\n\\n\r\n+ Great world-building and premise\\n\r\n+ Likable main characters, voiced by talented seiyuu\\n\r\n+ When the main story kicks in, it\u2019s really good\\n\r\n+ Fantastic background music, which complements the action sequences. \\n\r\n- Some of the episodic storylines ruin the pacing of the series \\n\r\n- Tonal shifts can be jarring at times and the comedy, at times, is misplaced. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4/10",

            "content": "The Lord of anime has graced us yet again with a no more than average creation.Same ol',same ol',I could say.For even if their powers are fairly refreshing,the plot is still ordinary.\r\nStory(7/10)\r\n*I more or less summarize some aspects of the story because I don't want to have to rewatch it again later to remember\r\nI will have mercy in this area because the idea of super powers named after different japanese books and their use appeared curious.But it still managed to dissapoint quite a bit.I can't even remember the characters' names except Dazai and Kyouka so I will look on the info to refresh my mind.Atsushi didn'tstrike me as an too inspiring protagonist.The story begins when he gets kicked out of the orphanage he was in because he was an eyesore and they didn't want the burden of one more child after so many strange attacks at night.After,when he was on the riverbank,he tries to save a drowning man but surprise!He was actually a suicide maniac who would love to die in a double suicide with a beautiful woman.As a reward for ''saving'' Dazai,the MC is given a meal and because he didn't have any place to go to,his future coworker gives him the offer to help at their detective agency.The protagonist was reluctant at first but after some incidents where it proved his worth and that he wouldn't trouble his comrades he decided to stay.But of course things aren't so easy,for he has a huge bounty on his head because of his previously discovered tiger power and the Port Mafia(and some other guys) are hunting him.A few other events lead to another and there are all kinds of cases to solve but the quarells because of Atsushi's power are the center of it all.Oh,and there aren't any particular plot twists so that's a let down...\\n\r\nIt ends with the revealing of a quite a peculiar possible villain so I'm wondering if the other season will ultimately save it or destroy it for good because till now it's way too ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art reminded me of Durarara a bit and I like that.It gets a passing grade from me,even if I love art like the one in Grimgar or Kabaneri more.Their expressions are funny and some of the characters look familliar.For example,Kenji reminds me a lot of Finnian and the girl from the last episode of Grell,both from Black Butler.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably my favorite thing from this show.I just love the way the opening opening starts with Dazai and then introduces the characters and some cool fight scenes.The ending changes in a more tame and sad tone and I could swear there is something going on between Dazai and Atsushi besides the coworker thing.Oh,and I love Ranpo and Dazai's seiyuus.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7/10)\\n\\n\r\nAtsushi has not a such unusual backstory:he has no parents(orphan) and was rejected by the people around him.He doesn't have any big aspirations,just to help the ones in need(like he did with Kyouka) and it's haunted by the same scene over and over again.Dazai is a total mystery besides his weird suicidal tendencies and his later revealed ex-place of work.The others are kind of alright,I like the ''nurse'',she has the most intriguing power in my opinion.But of course I dislike those frickin clingy Tanizaki brothers because of their obvious show of love,incest not being really my thing.And Akutagawa is another one of those disciples thet want to be noticed by senpai but end up with lots of screws loose.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(6/10)\\n\\n\r\nI'm not proud to say this however this has astonished me in any way.My sense of comedy has become Gintama-leveled so nothing less than weird and unbelievable shit can amuse me.As for action,I've seen a lot of it and much of it and this is only acceptable for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(7/10)\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't have high standards for comedy and action like me and don't mind the absence of plot twists and stuff too deep then I invite to give it a go.Even if only for the awesome op and ed,and boredom it would be a good choice.I sincerely hope the second season will raise to my standards and not let me doze off in my chair",

At first glance, it seemed like this anime was going to be more action built (it still was), but I was surprised at how much dedication they put into building character. Of course some characters were built more in comparison to others, but it was a very interesting thing to watch. I am a bit disappointed that the protagonist wasn't given the opportunity to showcase his ability and I believe this to be because of how far they delayed theopportunities. This caused me to suffice with the other characters' abilities, but it really would have been more satisfying to see the protagonist's in action more often. Overall, interesting anime and would recommend to watch casually.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\r\nThe typical building up of a protagonist who is a lost soul in their own reality who then comes to terms with their abilities and succeeds in things they never thought possible.

This series is one of them. This story is about gifted human beings with different abilities since they were born. The protagonist found himself alone, dying of hunger. That is when the time a special operative help him and coincidentally the one they are looking for. Along this season, different characters and abilities was introduced. Mainly, it was shown how the protagonist choose to survive on the harsh world he's in withthe people who accept him. It feels like the first season is mainly for introducing every significant characters of the story and the beginning of the war between groups of gifted humans with the principle they have. It seems bias but I really love this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nI love Dazai. The suicidal maniac who became really serious in times needed. I love this kind of character who is humble and act idiotic, but you know is genius and strong. Apart for him, the other characters have their own unique way of telling that they are also great. They all have different ideals and their actions correspond to that. They stand on their belief and help those in need. It is great how every characters is not perfect, they have flaws, weakness, and mix emotions. Oh. I think, there's one perfect but sulky type out there. \\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes on this series is awesome. The way before they displayed or use their skill is one of a kind. And the movement of the characters when they are in a fight is flawless. It was graceful but savage at the same time. Scratches, blood, marks are in there. The emotions of each of them when they are in pain, they are angry, they are serious is perfect. I really like the expression on their faces. You can tell what the characters are feeling the way the level of roughness on their faces changed. As well as the voices which suited their role.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode sold it to me. It really got me. It made me hook on the series. There are little anime out there who can do the same. The beginning of a story is very important. It is what makes the viewer continue. It is what excites them to turn in the next page. This series does not fail me. Every fights and characters are interesting. The comedy is there. It is a perfect combination.\\n\\n\r\nEnding: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is just the beginning. It only get started. The end of the season one is really exciting. It showed the antagonist they will need to face later on the story. The casts are complete so it will be the time to show all the cards. Feels like it. The series will just get more and more interesting. And I can't wait for that!",

            "content": "Bungou Stray Dogs was one of the better anime of this season. Not the best overall but still a decent start to the franchise as a second season is coming out in Fall 2016. I did enjoy this anime for some parts although I myself found this anime quite boring in some episodes.  In my opinion, it will appeal to a lot of people due to its action and decent story. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\n\tThe story of Bungou Stray Dogs is decent as of right now. It focuses a lot on our main character, Atsushi becoming a weretiger and how it affects his life. He goesto a detective agency which shelter him from the Port Mafia that are trying to take him because he has a large bounty on his head from all the chaos he has done. Now this anime is just boring for me, It does pick up in the later part of the series, around episode 10 but it is just plain boring before that. Nothing particularly interesting besides the detective scene happens before then and it feels like some of it is filler.  If you can survive that though, the story is more interesting and will surely bring us a treat in the second season. The main problem I have with the story itself is just how boring it can be. It was so hard to just watch it during some scenes because it wasn\u2019t very interesting. It was like watching the first episode of Fate/Zero for the first time and extending that for around 6 episodes. Although the story is unique, the writing just didn\u2019t interest me until 3/4 of the way through this anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe art of Bungou Stray Dogs is good for the most part. It\u2019s not the best by anyone\u2019s standards but it\u2019s not bad at all. Background art looks fine any character designs are good. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe sound is solid with a solid Op and decent Ed and it is sometimes nice to hear but there is no stand out track in my opinion and nothing I will remember very well such as Sword Land from SAO or The battle is to the strong from Fate/Zero. Overall, still a solid soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters to me are sort of interesting but they can honestly be annoying. Dazai to me is interesting but is dragged down by his desire to commit double suicide all the time. Atsushi is always afraid and I really don\u2019t like that about him. Although he can be cool at some moments, he just feels like an average character. Some of the cast can be forgettable while others aren\u2019t. There are some very memorable characters but the others just fade into obscurity for me. I believe they could be better developed too as only Atsushi, Dazia, and Kunikida are actually sort of developed throughout the series. Everyone else has little to no character development. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n\tI did enjoy the last part of the series a lot but I did not like the first part of the series. It was boring for me. I did not enjoy the comedy at all during this series either. It isn\u2019t very funny and the dialogue wasn\u2019t very interesting. Action was good but that was really the only thing I enjoyed Bungou Stray Dogs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n\tWith decent characters and a boring story until the later part of the anime, Bungou Stray Dogs sets itself up for the second season in Fall 2016. Animation and sound are solid and are a nice sized + to this series. Overall, should, you watch Bungou Stray Dogs? Yes, but it may not be for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nWatch If:\\n\r\n-\tYou like some good action\\n\r\n-\tLiked Kekkai Sensen\\n\r\n-\tA more unique spin on Mystery series\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t Watch If: \\n\r\n-\tYou like comedy (it\u2019s bad)\\n\r\n-\tCharacters and Story are a priority for you\\n",

            "content": "Spoiler free review everyone! ^^\r\n\"There is a way even in difficult times.\"\r\nI think that's overall the message of this series, and they use a pretty fresh \"non-cliche\" kind of showing  it to the viewers.\r\nLet's break this diamond into pieces, and I'll tell you some of the hits and misses:\r\nBACKGROUND, STORY AND SETTING: \r\nThe story focus on Atsuhi, a boy that has been kicked out from his orphanage due to a strange reason he still can't comprehend. And thanks to a kind action towars a man with Suicide Tendencies (Dazai) he ends up being involved in a company of supernatural detectives, each with it's owntalent. \\n\r\nBy that t's pretty interenting in it's own. \\n\r\nThe story revolves around a bunch of cases; and every one of those makes you learn a little bit more about the main character and the important side characters. That makes the anime go smooth, without not to much obvious exposition and it's pretty complementary.\\n\r\nWhat it's good about this anime, is that the min characters have a low of balance between them, and the moral of the good guys and bad guys can be very questionable. And you end up liking both sides.\\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUNDTRACK: \\n\r\nJust look at the intro. What I like about Bones studio is that they give each of their animes a pretty \"remarkable\" artsyle. And this one is full of color without being overwhelming. It's really pleasing to see and eyecatching. That paired up with the awesome rock-electro tipe of music gives you an awesome intro and so much of an aweosme background fighting music. \\n\r\nAs for the ending, it is a huge contrast, being mre calm and story-like.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: So this is my favorite part to talk when it comes to BSD, cause it is brilliant. For the ones who don't know, every relevant character in the series is named and inspired after a classic (mainly japanese or American) writer. And their powers as well.\\n\r\nWithout knowing this the anome is still great to see, but if know this fact and know the authours that inspired this character the anime becomes more interesting and a lot of fun to catch references.\\n\r\nOne complain is, that we do not see much character developmet from other characters that are not the main one, and that is kinda sad since the rest of the cast would be so interesting.\\n\\n\r\nTIME RATIO AND EXECUTION:\\n\r\nAs I told you, this anime doesn't go on a slow pace, but soemtimes I wished they could explain things a little bit better. I think than even when the motive of the \"good guys\" it's pretty clear, the one from the bad guys is kinda blurry and not that understandable. You can still figure it out by yourself, which is fun but I would have loved a little bit more depht in that part, and maybe I think that was becuase this season was just 12 episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nBungou Stray dogs was pretty impressive snce my first impression on this anime was that it was going to be pretty goofy and for comical purposes, but it ended up being more than that, the story is on cliffhanger and I am totally looking forward to see the second part of this o October. If you like omedy, you will like this. If you like action, you will like this.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Reviewing half of a show is tough. Because I know that this show has another half, it\u2019s hard to rate. That being said, I personally think that each season of a show should have a bit of closure, but for the sake of the review and for the show having that other half, I won\u2019t discuss the ending. So let\u2019s see how the 2016 show, Bungou Stray Dogs, fares when looked at it with the critical eye.\r\nStory\r\nThe premise of the show goes as follows. Atsushi, an orphan with special powers, gets recruited by a detective agency and fights alongside them. That\u2019s the setup of thisshow and that\u2019s what the first 3 episodes spend their time on. These episodes do a good job introducing the major characters of the series and the main conflict. Although there\u2019s a main conflict in this show, there\u2019s no actual plot. \\n\\n\r\nIt has time progression, but no actual plot. The show likes to go through mini arcs and shows development when that time progresses. How much development is debatable, but there is development nonetheless. With no direction for the series and no end goal, the show gets hit with the problems of poor pacing for time progression, but has good pacing with each episode (most of the time).\\n\\n\r\nAlongside these mini arcs are what boil down to 2 types of episodes: Action oriented conflict episodes and episodes revolved around solving a mystery. One of these types of episodes is good, but the other\u2026 not so much. \\n\\n\r\nThe mystery based episodes don\u2019t really give the audience a chance to figure it out because it introduces and solves a mystery in one episode. Not only this, but the episode likes to have comedic relief at the beginning of each episode. Seeing as the director of this show is Takuya Igarashi, director of Ouran High School Host Club, the comedic moments in this show makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they fit, because they don\u2019t, but it makes sense as to why they exist in the show. Before I get back to why the mystery episodes aren\u2019t very good, I need to address the comedy in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is VERY hit or miss. It seems repetitive at first, but gets somewhat more diverse as more characters are introduced and we see new character interactions. One of the main running gags is based around the character, Dazai. Dazai, based on a writer in real life (like every other character in this show, which is something I forgot to mention even though it\u2019s not that important), likes suicide and a lot of the early jokes revolve around this. \\n\\n\r\nOther jokes revolve around character interactions and reactions, but if you dislike the suicide jokes, you will really dislike the early jokes. I personally thought they were funny at first and got varied after a while, but I still felt that the joke was overused to an extent. \\n\\n\r\nMoving back to why the mystery episodes are bad, it\u2019s because they just turn into info dumps at the end of the episode. I personally still found these episodes enjoyable, but they are flawed. There\u2019s no way for the audience to actually figure out any of these \u201cmysteries\u201d (by the way I\u2019m using quotes now because they\u2019re barely mysteries) because we don\u2019t see any info besides what\u2019s introduced within 5 minutes of talking about the case.\\n\\n\r\nIn the show, it basically boils down to being at the right place at the right time, phrasing with how people say things, and a bit of plot convenience. The show technically follows the *echo voice* 10 commandments of writing mysteries *echo ends*, but it\u2019s just poorly executed.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual purpose of these episodes are to introduce and develop side characters, which is actually done pretty well, but it feels like the actual mysteries were an afterthought. The other type of episode is the action oriented episode. These episodes are better, but still have their problems. For one, the Port Mafia as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the perspective of the audience, the mafia and the agency are seen as black and white, good and bad. We almost never see the mafia in a positive light, and even if we do, those scenes are still laced with negative connotations towards the Port Mafia. \\n\\n\r\nThis seems pretty lazy as we get some interesting information about the mafia in relation to one of the main characters, but there\u2019s just so much more that could have been done with this conflict. \\n\\n\r\nOne last thing I want to mention with this show are its themes. Yes, this show actually has themes. It also has foil characters and a couple other literary terms I don\u2019t feel like mentioning. This show has themes of loyalty and redemption. These two themes aren\u2019t mind blowing, but it\u2019s nice to see that there\u2019s a little something to get out of it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the ED has some meaning to it, more than the OP, which was a nice touch and I\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t just a black screen like\u2026 other shows of the season\u2026 *cough* RE:Zero *cough*\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWe actually get backstory for a couple of the characters in this show. Atsushi isn\u2019t just some self-insert in this show and actually has a defined personality that somewhat changes as the show progresses. I mean, again, it isn\u2019t ground breaking, but having it there adds to his character. He also gets a backstory too. \\n\\n\r\nHis backstory makes sense in context to the story. He was exiled and hated as a child because of his power of turning into a weretiger, which is something I\u2019m going to mention. This is basically victimization of his character for sympathy, but is excused in context to the story.\\n\\n\r\nHis power of turning into a weretiger, however, is not excused. He\u2019s shown as not being able to control it, but when the plot demanded one time, he just got the ability to control it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you know the context for this scene, because I don\u2019t want to spoil the show, it could be seen that he got control over his powers in his desperation to help others, but it\u2019s still cheap and unexplained. \\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the other main characters of this show, we have Dazai and Kunikida. Dazai is the only character in this series that has the slightest bit of grey with him. \\n\\n\r\nCompared to other characters in this show, he has a good backstory that has a really nice reveal. It wasn\u2019t something I expected and I thought it added a lot to him. \\n\\n\r\nI just wish we got to see more of his past as there\u2019s so much more I want to know. Hopefully we\u2019ll learn more in season 2, but since this is a review of just season 1, I\u2019m a little disappointed. Besides his backstory, he has 2 main character traits: His silly suicide mode for when the comedy ensues and his serious mode.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes he uses his suicide mode as a fa\u00e7ade, which is something I thought was quite clever, but other times, it really ruins the mood of the moment.  The mood is something that really gets messed up because of these personality flips and I wish they had better transitions between the silly and serious. \\n\\n\r\nKunikida is the always serious, super organized agency member. His scheduling method creeps into other aspects of his life and he is quite idealistic. He\u2019s used as a direct mentor for Atsushi at first, then as a juxtaposed character to another character later on.\\n\\n\r\nAs a main character, he isn\u2019t as strong in terms of personality because he doesn\u2019t develop, likewise with Dazai. Atsushi and a couple side character are the only ones to get proper development, which is kind of disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters are enjoyable, but they don\u2019t all have the depth I would have liked. They have more effort put into them than a lot of other shows, but they aren\u2019t the deepest characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation\\n\\n\r\nOH MY GOD the music of this show. If you don\u2019t feel like watching this show at this point, at least watch episode 8 because it has the one of the greatest compilations of music in a single episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite memorable and a lot of the tracks are quite \\n\r\ndistinguished. And again, episode 8. I can consistently jam out while episodes play out because the soundtrack is that good.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is composed by Taku Iwasaki, known most for shows like \u201cNow and Then, Here and There\u201d, Rurushi Kenshin, Akame ga kill, and Noragami. As you can see, this show has some talent behind it. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also good and fits well. None of the voices feel out of place and characters emote well. If there\u2019s one song in the OST I don\u2019t really like, it\u2019s the OP, but it\u2019s still pretty decent. \\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is quite distinguished. It has a style that\u2019s different from other shows of this season. I personally like the detail to the eyes in this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe thick lines around characters in the comedic scenes really add a layer of uniqueness to the art style. This added with all the other little art style changes in the show really make this show stand out in terms of animation and art compare to your generic moeblob show of the season. \\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are especially something to note because they make up for the scenes that are somewhat\u2026 lacking. \\n\\n\r\nWhen there are closer shots, the faces are kind of\u2026 missing. You\u2019d think they\u2019d care a little more about the animation of faces, but it seems a little lazy in this aspect. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\\n\r\nThis show has its problems. It really does, but it also has another half to address some of these problems. It has comedy that\u2019s hit or miss. The animation is great most of the time, but, like other shows, has its lacking moments. The story has progression, but no clear direction. Some characters have nice characterization, development, and backstories, but others just don\u2019t have enough. The music is my favorite part of the show and really gets me hyped for watching each episode. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s some deeper meaning and themes that I, as a person who looks at the effectiveness of literary device, can appreciate the little meaning they add to certain places. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this show has more pros than cons, which is why I rate it a 6/10. If the second season gives more to the characters, development, and less mystery episodes it\u2019ll be better overall. If you care to know my personal enjoyment score, it\u2019s a 7.5/10 because I usually tried to watch these episodes right when they came out and got especially excited during the fight scenes, but I wasn\u2019t screaming while episodes ran like some people I\u2019ve seen.\\n",

            "content": "I was very interested in Bungou Stray Dogs since I had seen many badass screen shots of the anime, so I had quite high expectations for it. But they were all shot down after I went to read few reviews of the anime before I started to watch it. Some liked it a lot, others not so much. I've seen many say that it's kind of a mess (at least this first season) and I have to agree with them. \r\nThe story is interesting, don't get me wrong, but at least with this first season, it's feels as if it's standing on a weak ground- we don't really get to know about the universe that much. Though, like with many animes, you can't really blame them since this is the first season. There were some super weird moments but all in all, it does follow your basic anime tropes. \\n\\n\r\nBones studio has their lows and highs with the art style. Though I have to say that BSD has the best art style out of the other animes from the studio that I've watched - at least consistency wise. The art style was actually one of the reasons why I was so intrigued by this anime in the first place. But please... no more of that fisheye lens shots... they're so ugly...  \\n\\n\r\nGotta be honest, didn't pay that much attention to the music, and I'm still not the biggest fan of the ending, but the opening was great!\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated before, I don't think you can blame them for showing only the minimal surface of the characters since this is the first season. Though there were some moments when the characters acted in a way I didn't think fit their characters but oh well. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment while watching this show was surprisingly high - I actually laughed out loud few times. Though the fact that they seem to kinda push this fourteen (14) year old girl to have romantic feelings towards an eighteen (18) year old boy is creepy and I was kinda uncomfortable every time they even hinted at it in your typical anime style. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did like this anime and I will watch the other season, and even read the manga.

However, it did a pretty good job of establishing the universe and giving some background to the main characters, enough to leave me wanting to know more. \r\nAlso just a personal thing for me but Dazai kind of reminds me of Yato from Noragami, insanelystrong with dark history but still a dork with big bastard energy which I'm finding to be one of my new favourite character tropes.",

            "content": "With thrilling action, quirky characters, and a bit of zany comedy, Bungou Stray Dogs is a great mix of excitement and hilarity.\r\n[I must note that a second season will be airing in the Fall, so my thoughts here are based on the fact that the story will have a continuation.]\r\nFor the story, I'm unsure what to think of it. With what we got, it's simply different groups of organizations at each other's throats because they have their own ideals. Now, that's good and all, I don't really mind it, but I have this feeling that there should be something that gives us the \"big picture\"behind everything. If so, it just hasn't happened yet. What I will praise the show for is the writing. There's this odd mixture of seriousness and wacky comedy that somehow blends pretty well. I personally enjoy it, and believe it's what makes the show unique.\\n\\n\r\nThe best aspect of the show is the characters. We get a whole cast of personalities, and they all have enough time in the spotlight to where we can get a good read on them. And that last statement was an unintentional pun, as I should point out that the characters are all based on well-known authors. Even though a lot of these names I'm not familiar with, this is what drew me into the series. And what's great is there's more to them than their names; they shine when they need to and interact with each other nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThis was another series this season that did well with keeping up on the animation. Rarely did I see any flaws, and if so, they were probably so small I didn't realize. The animation also helps emphasize the comedy portions as the style and the character models change to match the mood. If it wasn't for that, I think the comedy wouldn't have gone over that well.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the thing that interest me was how the characters were depicting real-life authors. Yet I'm glad that wasn't the only thing that the series had going for it. It also makes we want to have a look at the original works these authors have written. Bungou Stray Dogs was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and it makes me excited for the second season (which, by the way, was announced before this season aired).",

            "content": "WARNING:\r\nThis might contain some of em car parts you seem to dislike so much\r\nBungou Stray Dogs, a masterpiece of innovation in this bland world we live in. Now if you are one of those heated fans of the series you'd better leave before my meds wear off and I beat that last statement.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nWelp time's out chaps here comes the buggery.\r\nStory of Bungou Stray Dogs is one that seems to want to play a few different tones but ends up doing that plain old riff everybody's already heard from at least ten other sources. Main character and some of the antagonists had unlucky childhoods, orphaned andpushed aside, they find their place in a group that accepts them for what the others shunned them for and so on. This is where I'll can it with the story cause frankly there isn't much to say that isn't said in the synopsis. Here's a 3 cause it didn't make me set my earphones on fire.\\n\\n\r\n Err you know I've realized what usually turns my piss to blood. It's bad characters. After animation and sound, which are the strongest tools of visual media, characters are ones that provide talking material. Any story can be made fun when you've got good characters and more importantly who else will end up on those waifu pillows? You aren't going to spend hours talking to your friends which scene had the best drawn bench. In that department Bungou Stray Dogs does better than it does in story. There are some interesting chaps and, unlike D.Gray-man: Hallows, they do get quite an amount of screen time. Shame is that in the end most emphasis is put on the crappiest twats. Your by the book MC, who gets worse by every word he says, is our focus when it comes to the good fellas. For big baddy we've received Vlad Drakul who likes to stick people on sharp things, also his voice sounds really gurgly. These two wonderfully boring people battle it out on more than one occasion and it's just as boring as you'd expect it. Now enough about them, let's shed some positivity. There's a suicidal bloke who does help make some jokes funny when paired up with his partner with glasses who's stiff. There's a few more oddballs in there and I appreciate that. In the end characters do offer fleeting pleasure due to simple diversity of the cast. In the end it's a 6 or 7 let's say a 6.5.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound should get fives across the boards. Unfortunately five is a pretty crap grade here isn't it? In short animation isn't too thrilling and songs are more or less poop on a stick.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is existent but is less and less present as the anime progresses and more annoying characters are implemented while fun ones get pushed aside. Comedy is similar to one attempted in Taboo Tattoo but executed better resulting in some chuckles. Action is fun at times, fights that involve our protagonist still being boring as history class about post stamps. It goes from 7 to 2 slowly over the course of episodes so it's hard to deduce the grade. I'll settle for 6 cause I'm a good fella.\\n\r\nAt least that's my mother says.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Dogs is not so much a disappointment as it is overrated. I do dislike that word but lately it seems to be fitting a lot of anime. Dogs might be the best of its season or even year but things it contains don't change no matter how many awards you give it or how many fans tongue bathe it. There's a new season upcoming but I think studio is barking up the wrong tree over here. Oh sod it I had to make at least one dog pun. By now you might be asking yourself:Should you watch this?\\n\\n\r\nHeck if I know. I'm just here to put my opinion and piddle over mediocre anime. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT: There's a part I consider quite stupid. This is a smaaall spoiler about a characters superpower so feel free to skip on it but it's been bothering me. Namely Akutagawa's Rashomon ,,eating,, space between him and enemy attacks making them ineffective. Which kinda makes completely no sense. What happens in one occasion is that somebody shoots at him and he ,,eats,, the space between bullets and him making them lose velocity. This boggles me cause he's effectively increasing the impact by shortening the distance they gotta pass. That would make bullets arrive to him at a bigger velocity instead of drop down. Now later on he does the same bollocks but this time around it manifests as a barrier. How does it work for the love of all omnipotent beings of questionable existence! Also how does it work for melee attacks? \\n\\n\r\nBah that'd be it I'm ending the rant about Rashomon's ability here.",

(this kind of reminds me of Hamatora)\r\nWhat Idon't like:\\n\\n\r\nThe villains - I always pay attention to the villains since they play a great role in motivating the main characters. Sadly, the enemies in this story (so far) seemed to be so lame compared to our dear detectives.\\n\\n\r\nLack of intellectual thrill - I was looking forward to the creative and complex crime cases that the story could produce. But it just didn't happen. Perhaps on the 2nd season?\\n\\n\r\nGenerally though,  I would still recommend Bungou Stray Dogs not for those who want hardcore mystery and crime stories but rather those who wish to have a good laugh. \\n\\n\r\nDazai Osamu is one huge troll.",

            "content": "Most of the reviews of this series on MAL seem to either make it out to be either absolutely outstanding or absolutely awful, but I shall try to take a more balanced standpoint on this matter. \r\nLet's start with the \"GOOD\".\r\n1. Characters\r\nThis series puts the majority of its focus on character introduction and development. \r\nEach episode focuses most of its attention on developing/introducing one main or supporting character while allowing for better understanding of the other characters by showing how they react to either the focal character of the episode or how they react to a situation in contrast to the focal character. This allowsthe audience to fully understand each character, which many similar series with a relatively large main/supporting cast fail at doing without making the characters or their development cliche or generic, or putting too much focus on one character in an episode and ignoring the rest. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quirky and interesting, the art style is clean and the voice acting spectacularly fitting, so the series has a natural, relatable, easy to follow flow despite its relatively odd premise. \\n\\n\r\n2. Balance of comedy and mystery\\n\r\nBeing a mysterious detective-based series with a supernatural twist, the series does a great job at building suspense and pacing the storyline. \\n\r\nAdd in a pretty unique, somewhat dark and unexpected comedic style, and you get an appropriate balance of lightheartedness (paired with the liberal use of chibis and comic speech bubbles) and dark twists comparable to the Pandora Hearts manga (although, on a side note, I personally still prefer Pandora Hearts). \\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the \"BAD\".\\n\r\n1. Storyline\\n\r\nAs I said previously, this series puts the majority of its focus on its characters and character development. While this is good in some ways, they almost completely neglected developing a decent storyline. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I have no idea what the Port Mafia's goals are even after the first 11 episodes besides the fact that they want to capture Atsushi to get the \u00a57 Billion bounty. I don't know why they were created, why Akutagawa goes around brutally murdering innocent people and what they are after. I just know they take part in illegal smuggling, have a bunch of ability-users and hate the Armed Detective agency, who are trying to stop them from smuggling weapons and murdering people.  The goals of the recently introduced \"guild\" are even more vague. \\n\\n\r\nNone of the groups seem to have any goals except to try and defeat each other, and each episode brings a different storyline/immediate goal for each group. The story is just all over the place.\\n\\n\r\n2. Originality\\n\r\nRanpo is like a more socially unaware version of Izaya from Durarara, even going as far as having the same voice actor. \\n\\n\r\nAtsushi is a typical, whiny, confused main character thrown into unexpected circumstances, who is surprisingly OP only when it's convenient for the plot and who struggles to come to terms with and adapt to his sudden change of lifestyle. Throw in a tragic, PTSD-inducing backstory that either makes him freak out in cowardly ways or suddenly become badass, and a tendency to strive to become stronger to protect his friends, running away when he feels like he's a burden in the process, you basically get an early Tokyo Ghoul Kaneki without the human-eating. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, while some of the characters are relatively original and unique, others are just redrawn, slightly distorted versions of characters from other series. \\n\r\n(They even took some abilities from other series.)\\n\\n\r\n3. The entire concept of their abilities.\\n\r\nNobody knows how the characters got their abilities or where they came from, so the setting is vague as well. Would be better if we could have a backstory of how abilities develop.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime, overall, is definitely not anywhere near awful. It provided me with a good source of entertainment and was a pretty decent time-killer.\\n\\n\r\nI'd still recommend it, but it does have several points it could work on.  \\n\\n",

Spoilers ahead!)\r\nBungou Stray Dogs has a lot of references to words and books and authors.\r\nI, too, used to have a penchant for reading. When I was younger, I would always have a book in hand \u2013 at school, at home, or at family gatherings. I even remember coming in second in my fifth-grade class\u2019s multi-genre book-finishing bonanza. (Darn you, Meredith.)\r\nI have been doing my best to get back into the habit. Partly to enjoy some different stories, and partly to up my writing game even further.\r\nAs for Stray Dogs, well, its tale may only be halftold, but it appears it has a tough time even getting to second place.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nStray Dogs begins with a rather sour mood. Atsushi, an orphan-turned-street-urchin, finds himself hungry and, more importantly, in need of money. Luckily, he encounters Dazai. Floating in the water. In the middle of an apparent suicide. Not so luckily, this fateful meeting allows Atsushi to join the Armed Detective Agency \u2013 and take part in some crazy (and dangerous) shenanigans.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe Stray Dogs is that it\u2019s an anime that tries to be everything but nothing sticks.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tries to be a comedy with its over-the-top reactions, but the semi-serious atmosphere gets in the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tries to be a drama with its \u201ckidnapping\u201d conflicts and near-death scenarios, but, since the Armed Detective Agency is always the best and always stronger, any sense of danger is lost.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tries to be a mystery with its detective cases, but the literal Sherlock-Holmes-esque character ruins any chance at guessing (let alone needing to worry about potential problems).\\n\\n\r\nThe show tries to be a romance with Atsushi\u2019s relationship with Kyouka, but it seems to skirt around the possibility despite the moments they have had together thus far.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tries to be quirky, with each person having a specialized ability, but no actual explanations behind their gifts have been given, leaving it all up as \u201cjust because.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nClearly, Stray Dogs tries. A lot. And those attempts are not inherently an issue, for many, many anime dabble in multiple elements at once. (Arguably all stories are a combination of elements and not strictly a singular one.)\\n\\n\r\nBut this anime fails at fully committing to any of its elements. Almost as if it wants to have the element just to have it.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, it does have an element that works: action. Through the characters\u2019 abilities and general outclassing of their opponents, Stray Dogs gives its back-alley brawls and boating battles many cool twists and intrigue. \u201cLight Snow\u201d changes the field into a virtual representation. \u201cRashoumon\u201d incites fear, pain, and dread. Atsushi\u2019s \u201cWeretiger\u201d morphing creates dynamism everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the teamwork of Dazai and Kunikida during their two-fronts fight, Miyazawa\u2019s nonchalant prowess, and the otherworldly dreamscape that Lucy forces the others to play \u201chide-and-seek\u201d in. So, despite the show\u2019s general lack of focus, its action, at the very least, is given a nice amount of attention.\\n\\n\r\nThis season is also technically just the first-half of the whole experience. Meaning, a goal of the anime is to simply set everything up for what is to come later. And, for the most part, it did just that.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Dazai\u2019s background of betrayal with the Port Mafia is known but not explicitly divulged. Atsushi and Kyouka\u2019s relationship, while not anywhere particularly noteworthy, has the makings of something grander down the line. Each member of the Armed Detective Agency, more or less, gets time to shine so that, later on, the show does not have to spend time hyping up its cast.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime does not do so hot when it comes to some of its other decisions.\\n\\n\r\nKunikida\u2019s mini-arc in the middle of this season somewhat gets forgotten once it concludes.\\n\\n\r\nThe introduction of brand-new baddies makes the Port Mafia\u2019s grudge feel pointless. (Although, admittedly, Atsushi and the others need competition from other ability users because, as has been shown, guns, knives, and thugs are not enough to slow the main gang down.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd the main plot itself \u2013 the Port Mafia (and other evil people) looking to claim the bounty placed on Atsushi\u2019s head \u2013 is neither nuanced nor engrossing. It does not even come off as a strong motivator. It\u2019s not as though Atsushi wronged people or was a specific person who had the potential to affect the future; he is literally just being targeted for money.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s ending seems poised for further, more foreboding trouble on the horizon. But, with how scattered the anime feels and how off-the-mark many of its narrative choices have been, it\u2019s hunched over rather than standing upright.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nEasily, Stray Dogs\u2019s best component is its art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nTo combat the somewhat static setting \u2013 the offices of the Armed Detective Agency \u2013 the anime makes an effort to visit different parts of the city. A bomb-ridden subway. Near the side of a local river. The bloodied, muddied torture room. The inside of an abandoned building. Their local bar joint.\\n\\n\r\nMore than the variety, however, is the lighting. Stray Dogs likes to play with purples, greens, and oranges to bask the different scenes and locations in colored lights that either accentuate the foreground action or provide some beautiful-looking detail. Often times, it is both at once.\\n\\n\r\nSimultaneously, the anime achieves that hyperactive comedy through its visual shifts. When a character is doing something particularly funny \u2013 usually making a face of some kind \u2013 the show adopts a more cartoony display for those involved. This trick not only elevates the comedy but also helps to differentiate what is supposed to be taken seriously and what is supposed to be taken hilariously.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation levels also keep up the same quality. Even with the detailed backgrounds and heavy lighting, the characters move quite a bit for both comedic and dramatic purposes. Especially so during the fight scenes. Atsushi jumping off walls, Akutagawa\u2019s black aura and red void devouring everything around him, and Higuchi doing whatever she can to save her leader demonstrate the show\u2019s penchant for above-average actual animation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the character designs continue with the consistent quality. Some of them, like Miyazawa\u2019s and Edogawa\u2019s, have designs that define where they come from (blue overalls and a straw hat) and who they are as people (a brown detective outfit complete with hat and shawl). A couple of them are just cool, like Kunikida\u2019s glasses and red tie or Higuchi\u2019s professional black-and-white work suit.\\n\\n\r\nBut they can also be subtle and, by extension, clever. Atsushi\u2019s loose belt hangs behind him as though it were a tail (alluding to his weretiger power), and Akiko wears a butterfly clip in her hair (alluding to her \u201crebirth\u201d power).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe Armed Detective Agency houses a kooky cast of characters. From the suicidal Dazai to the \u201call knowing\u201d Edogawa, the crew are not so much a couple of misfits (let alone nitwits) as they are a venerable, formidable group.\\n\\n\r\nSuch traits are evidenced by their abilities. Some have already been pointed out, but, for the sake of completeness, they will be relisted (mostly) in-full here since they define these characters.\\n\\n\r\nAtsushi can turn into a spectral tiger \u2013 the weretiger as it were. Dazai nullifies any and all abilities. Akutagawa summons forth a demon that literally devours everything (even the space about him). Kyouka controls a ghostly, deadly samurai. Akiko can regenerate anyone back to perfect health. Miyazawa wields impossible strength. Edogawa can surmise the solution to any situation in less than a minute. Kunikida can create items just by writing them down and ripping out a page from his journal.\\n\\n\r\nAs many already know, however, each ability comes with a catch, a caveat attached to his or her power. Atsushi\u2019s is difficult to control reliably. Dazai\u2019s only works through touch. Kyouka\u2019s can only be accessed through her phone. Akiko must be near the edge of death before her healing can work. Miyazawa has to be incredibly hungry. Edogawa\u2019s is technically not even a power whatsoever. Kunikida can only make something as big as his journal.\\n\\n\r\nSuch limiters keep them each from being ultra-powerful. I.e., they have a cap on what they can do (which is a common idea in the medium) to provide some semblance of weakness.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the basis for their powers is still unknown (reiterating an earlier point), they at least mirror their persons and personalities. Atsushi is a scared, nervous boy, but he turns into a ferocious tiger. Miyazawa is a super nice, super friendly kid, but he can pick up an entire car by himself. Akiko is a doctor, but she must first brutally torture her \u201cvictims\u201d before she can save them. And so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nFor those paying attention, a name has been skipped for a few paragraphs now: Akutagawa.\\n\\n\r\nPresumably, his ability makes him very sick \u2013 seen (and heard) from his constant coughing \u2013 but it is difficult to say if this caveat is, indeed, the correct one. Because, after his initial introduction, such sickness no longer shows up. Yes, he nearly dies in his battle with Atsushi, but dying through tiger punches is not the same as succumbing to a crippling disease.\\n\\n\r\nPresumably as well, his anger fuels his Rashoumon familiar, but, again, it is not a done detail.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, Akutagawa himself directly ties into one of the most important relationships, one of the most important dynamics, in the entire show: the connection shared between him and Atsushi.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets slowly revealed that Akutagawa was once the apprentice of Dazai. \u201cWas once\u201d because Dazai is now the enemy of the Port Mafia and because Dazai has taken on Atsushi as his apprentice (of sorts) instead.\\n\\n\r\nRight away, this shift in status provides a basis for Akutagawa\u2019s rage. His master, the man who taught and led him, has left everything behind, taking on an inferior pupil? And to top it all off, he gets told directly to his face by his former tutor that the new guy is better? It would be hard to not get frustrated or at least aggravated.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not the headbutting between the two that sticks out the most, though. Rather, it is how much they contrast one another.\\n\\n\r\nMore obvious details, like one representing good and the other representing evil, exist. But there are others, too. For instance, Akutagawa does not personally fight, using a summon instead, but Atsushi does, going paw-to-paw with his opponents. One likes money and living and has other interests whereas the other cares only about succeeding. Atsushi follows everyone else around, and Akutagawa leads everyone else around.\\n\\n\r\nThe most striking difference, however, is in the way they have been cast out.\\n\\n\r\nAtsushi was an orphan early in his life, but then his orphanage orphaned him, too, leaving him out to fend for himself. He did not ask for such treatment; it\u2019s just how his life has proceeded.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, Akutagawa pushes others away. Even his direct subordinate he treats as a nuisance. As somebody who will only hamper him.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the season, where they end up \u2013 Atsushi with a bunch of new friends and control of his power, Akutagawa comatose \u2013 reflects just how important it is to have people around that care. Indeed, if not for Higuchi, Akutagawa may have been in far more dire straits.\\n\\n\r\nIt must be noted, though, that Atsushi\u2019s actual character is quite weak. Stray Dogs repeats his same backstory (often with the same exact visuals) ad nauseam, and his transition from not being in control of his weretiger power to being in control somewhat just happens for the sake of progressing the story (e.g., no extensive training is undergone).\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the anime tries to give Atsushi more to his character by saying that his presence brings bad luck to those around him. Of course, the opposite is true since he saves Kyouka. It also helps to give his feeling of isolation more support. Meaning his character is not a total miss. Just a very big one.\\n\\n\r\nAkutagawa is slightly better overall. While his backstory consists of about one scene of Dazai punching him in the face, Stray Dogs does well in setting Akutagawa up for the next season.\\n\\n\r\nHe joins the scene in hardcore fashion \u2013 warnings from Kunikida to run away at all costs and blowing up a police building. Then Akutagawa maims Junichirou from behind, rips off Atsushi\u2019s leg, and manipulates Kyouka.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, he is built up as this strong, ruthless, and troubled dude. So, when Atsushi demolishes him in their second fight near the end of the season, putting said dude into a coma and into disfavor with his main boss, the anime clearly has an arc for him. An arc that he will (hopefully) continue to follow in the next season to show off more of his power and his evolution as a person.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast, Kunikida is the only one to get a couple of personalized episodes. Hints at there being more to his character and past exist, but the anime does not go that route (for now at least), so he does not have much going for him at this moment.\\n\\n\r\nHiguchi gets some attention, too, making her more than just a tagalong that got slapped in the face by the leader she loves. But, after her and Kunikida, the anime does not provide much else on the others.\\n\\n\r\nA final discussion point. The anime does not have many other strong themes to speak of (besides Atsushi and Akutagawa\u2019s isolation). \u201cOne is more than the power that defines him or her\u201d is one possible idea, but it takes a backseat to the ever-present comedy and action. The show has an entire second season to wrap up or tie back specific motifs, however, so it still has a chance to go deeper than it has.\\n\\n\r\nIn total, Atsushi, Akutagawa, and the rest have a lot to prove, but, given that this is the first half to the split-cour, the cast sit in a competent spot moving forward.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nWhile none of the voice acting stands out, Yuto Uemura as Atsushi, in one of his first major roles, does well in providing the distraught dude with a nervous, strained voice during many of his (earlier) encounters.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track is a step down. It\u2019s all over the place \u2013 much like the show\u2019s contents. Techno beats and screechy background sound-effects, harder guitar and drums, and a vocalist that echoes in parts and varies the rhythm in others. The different pacing throughout helps to make the piece more interesting, but, overall, it\u2019s nothing more than a loud and forgettable song.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track, however, performs better. Compared to the OP, it is a slow song, relying more on the singer to carry it. Thankfully, he does, holding notes, stringing lyrics, and changing pitch where needed. All the while, the more relaxed guitar and steady drum beat help to support him with the final few seconds sending the ED off in high spirits.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, some of the tracks in the original soundtrack are weirdly likable. \u201cHaji no Ooi Shougai wo\u201d is somewhat bubbly and bluesy. \u201cI Know no Susume\u201d is killer with heavy guitar supported by deafening drums. \u201cFurachi\u201d has moaning women and chirping birds mixed into it. The rest of the tracks, though, are not as noteworthy, but they do at least bring the atmosphere \u2013 be it ominous, tense, or calm.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI know what you\u2019re thinking.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhy are you writing this review now? The second season (really a split-cour) is almost over, so why not just wait for the whole series to come to an end first before writing this up?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMy answer is that I write a review for everything I complete (barring edge cases like OVAs and other miscellaneous material). This season is technically separated from its brother. Therefore, I find it fair game to critique it now.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, I\u2019m stubborn. I wanted to write it, so, gosh darn it, I am going to.\\n\\n\r\nTangents aside, I didn\u2019t hate the show, but I was not too fond of it either. Naomi\u2019s overzealous crush on her brother was silly, and Dazai teasing Kunikida got soft laughter out of me. But a lot of the show\u2019s drama and quirkiness fell flat.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s mostly due to the characters being generally uninteresting. Sure, Dazai\u2019s whole kill-himself-through-barrel-torture is funny the first time, but his shtick got old quick. Edogawa wasn\u2019t the nicest guy around, so I did not particularly welcome him. Atsushi was slightly annoying, too.\\n\\n\r\nI did, however, like Kunikida, Kyouka, and Akiko. Kunikida\u2019s whole ideal-centric mindset is something that I can somewhat relate to (i.e., wanting to achieve an \u201cideal\u201d lifestyle). Kyouka was simply a cute character, and, as a big fan of cuteness, she easily jumped up my list of favorite characters from this show. And Akiko was a smidge insane, but that trait is what made her fun.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, they are not enough to make me want to check out the second season anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs sets itself up somewhat, but, ultimately, the anime does not have a clear heading. The story is unfocused and uninteresting, and Atsushi\u2019s character did not have a high level of execution. At the minimum, the art is very nice, the action is pretty cool, and Akutagawa makes for at least an intriguing villain. But that does not put this one anywhere near well-read.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, tries to be too much at once, containing strong action scenes and questionable narrative decisions\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, nice artistic direction, above-average actual animation, and interesting character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Akutagawa has some setup for later, his dynamic with Atsushi is clear and contrasting, and the rest of the cast, while not explored, at least have their abilities fused with their personalities\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, some cool fights, but the plot is boring and most of the cast is simply uninteresting\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Bungou Stray Dogs is at the minimum an enjoyable and somewhat mysterious watch.\r\nWhen I started this show, I was personally intrigued by the setting of an orphan character with undiscovered supernatural abilities. It felt exciting and mysterious. I feel like after watching it, I was both surprised and somewhat disappointed that I still have unanswered questions in regard to the show's plot and setting.\r\nThe series starts with a lot of potential; introducing viewers to a stereotype of a somewhat naive inexperienced teenager as the protagonist who gets involved with a detective agency made up of individuals with supernatural abilities. And here's where it might startto slip: all of these characters are fairly interesting but I felt like none of their backgrounds or stories were adequately explored. In the same vein, no solid explanation seems to be provided for the existence of supernatural abilities in the world the anime is set in. The organizations and institutions are barely explained; and one feels like a lot is taken for granted for the viewer to simply accept who the good and bad guys are and their stereotypes\\n\\n\r\nAnd that, I think is Bungou Stray Dogs' main issue for me. The potential amazing storyline that it starts off with, hits hurdles as nothing seems to be subsequently fully explored. The theme of one of the main characters' past and his growth for instance, has no explicit explanation; visual or otherwise, of how his life at the orphanage was actually like. (Note: this might very well be partly because of the low amount of episodes S1 has to play itself out within, I'm looking forward to watching S2)\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, none of the above means it's not enjoyable to watch. I had plenty of moments where the timing of comedic scenes made me wonder if the show intended for itself to be taken seriously or not; but I also did have multiple giggles with the different types of humor each character brought to the show. Take for instance one of the main characters, Dazai, whose suicidal humor seems (to me at least) to fit his character of a subtly silly but in reality impressive and strategic leader. \\n\\n\r\nI personally found no issues with the animation; and the action scenes, despite suffering from poor setting (as explored some paragraphs above) are definitely enjoyable and capture the thrill or edge of the scene in most instances.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, though the plot will contain disappointments for anyone looking for a serious action show; the characters and action scenes make it a tolerable watch (and maybe even a highly enjoyable experience as it was for me) as a whole.",

Not only that some characters are very cringe worthy such as Kunikida, Atsushi, and Akutagawa. These 3 are pretty big characters in the story and they are so annoying at times especially Akutagawa who has a stupid goal and only way to achieve it, is through the dumbest methods cause he's possibly slow in the head.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nI had some fun with this show but not throughout the entire thing, I had hoped that there would be more info about Dazai and the port mafia\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nCould've been much better",

            "content": "\u2018Bungou Stray Dogs\u2019 is that anime of the season which seems to have an identity crisis. It\u2019s supernatural, drama, mystery, and action all rolled into one. Which made me very confused as I watched it. I personally thought it as a supernatural action in the second half, but the first half is still\u2026confusing to me.\r\nOf course, everything is rectified because of Dazai.\r\nHe\u2019s funny with all his suicide attempts. (I am implying that suicide is funny. It isn\u2019t. But the way Dazai approached it was funny.) In fact, he meets Atsushi while trying to drown himself.\r\ndazai drowning\r\nDazai is also a genius. He notices things. Most peoplemight see him as this fool type of character, but he masks his genius with jokes and a chibi face.\\n\\n\r\nBut he sees things. (Like Rampo. But not like Rampo.) I mean, Dazai is a genius. A pure genius.\\n\r\nEven if he doesn\u2019t look like it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don\u2019t like all the characters, I do like the relationships within the series.\\n\\n\r\ndazai and kunikida\\n\\n\r\nThe friendly animosity between Kunikida and Dazai is pretty cool. I know it sounds very oxymoronic, but it\u2019s true. They fight a lot (Especially about Kunikida\u2019s notebook), but they will save each other if push comes to shove.\\n\\n\r\nAtsushi and Dazai have a friendly relationship. It follows a mentor and mentee relationship, though. I think Dazai\u2019s pushing (Which is part of his personality) really changes Atsushi and forces him to go out of his comfort zone. Which I think is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, am I the only one who ships Kyouka and Atsushi? I mean, they are so cute together. And I think Kyouka has a crush on him actually. (As seen in her worry in the last episode.) Some could call it a brother-sister relationship, but I push it farther. SHIP SHIP SHIP.\\n\\n\r\nDoes anyone else just adore the powers? I mean, it\u2019s gorgeous. Drop dead gorgeous. The animation of Light Snow is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I love Dazai\u2019s power. It\u2019s different and unique. I\u2019ve never seen something like that before. (Okay\u2026I lied. There\u2019s a character like that in \u2018Shatter Me\u2019 by Tahereh Mafi. Whose name I forget.)\\n\\n\r\ndazai's power\\n\\n\r\nOverall, all the powers look awesome. I love it!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is gorgeous. Let me just\u2026let you listen to it. And you\u2019ll know why.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a beautiful song. And the animation is amazing. You see a lot of the characters. You even get peeks at their powers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut there are a lot of problems too. A lot.\\n\\n\r\nAtsushi is the main character, but he seems to take a backseat to Dazai.\\n\\n\r\nI felt like Atsushi was a great character. But he didn\u2019t get a lot of screentime. All I know about him is as follows (SPOILERS): he\u2019s an orphan, he is the weretiger, and he\u2019s nice.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I got. Which is sad since he IS the main character.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the anime was great. We had a lot of Agency v Port Mafia tension.\\n\\n\r\nport mafia\\n\\n\r\nTop 5 Mystery Anime That\u2019ll Make You Feel Like Detectives\\n\r\nGenius In Isolation \u2013 Subete Ga F Ni Naru: The Perfect Insider Review\\n\r\nNeed Something o Laugh? \u2013 Top 5 Comedy Anime\\n\r\nBut the first half was confusing. There were some mysteries. (I liked the one where we got introduced to Rampo.) And some things that expanded on each Agency character. We had episodes about Rampo and Kunikida.\\n\\n\r\nWhich could explain why Atsushi is kinda ignored in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut it didn\u2019t seem like enough meat. I could have dropped the anime at that point without regrets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is something that made me so mad. The plot twist.\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t so surprised really. Since the second season announcement, I knew a plot twist was coming.\\n\r\nBut I got really mad.\\n\\n\r\nThrowing in America again, hm? Thanks, Japan. Love you too.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I was most mad about was this guy.\\n\\n\r\nevil dude\\n\\n\r\nHe says \u2018old sport\u2019 as if we\u2019re not ripping off Gatsby. Only Gatsby is allowed to say that.\\n\r\nUnless this guy ends up being named Gatsby? I\u2019ll riot either way.\\n",

            "content": "Story 8/10: I'll never fault an anime for presenting me with a universe that I am just supposed to accept, that's how anime works. What leaves me unsettled is that I was hoping for at least some sort of explanation as to why some people have powers, just because of how specific some are (ex. being able to materialize something no bigger than a notebook, or a power that is only activated by receiving orders over a phone call). What keeps the story score floating is that you should know going into this that there is another season coming up, so most of this seasonwas used for introduction, setup, and development\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: Character designs are pretty straightforward and very nicely drawn. What I think is noteworthy here is that what got me to start watching this show was a sponsored Facebook add from Crunchyroll that showed the fight scene from the end of the first episode: the fight was wonderfully animated, and I find it very visually pleasing whenever someone uses their ability. Side note: Atsushi's belt really bothered me at first, you'll see why.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Like I mentioned above with the story, this first season was about introduction, setup, and development, this is most evident with their character development. Each character was pretty much given at least one episode to go on an adventure with the main character, Atsushi, which gave them all the perfect amount of time to let you get to know them. By the end of the first season, I had opinions and feeling about each of the characters at the agency, which I feel makes me even more pumped for season two. Also, Dazai is my favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: With an excellent balance of funny moments, character development, plot, and action, every episode was a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: I did say every episode was a joy to watch, and they were, but this was still a setup season. So, even though they had some epic moments during the series, I know I won't be wrong for saving my 10/10 for season two.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I want from season two:\\n\r\n-More people with abilities for even cooler fight scenes\\n\r\n-A speech that gives me goosebumps\\n\r\n-The President of the agency to use his ability (its gotta be awesome if he's the president of an agency for of people with abilities, right?)",

They did not make the ending obvious like some anime do, nor did it make me want to skip any of it.\r\n It was pretty bright at first (I honestly was quite skeptic at first), but then it turned to be much darker thanI expected, and I enjoyed it and got drawn into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI think it was really good, it's a bit unique but I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story started pretty weird actually but it turned to be pretty dark, with unexpected turns of events.\\n\\n\r\nSound: OST fit the anime pretty well, battle scene soundtracks were pretty good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I loved the characters, the further I got into the story, the more I discovered about them.

All very edgy and bright and hard to forget.\r\nWhat went wrong: \r\nThe plot got bogged down with gags and character arcs that didn't quiet make sense. Yes, the story telling was going for big reveals later on and building upto it, but when things happened, it just felt like slap stick comedy in the meantime. \r\nAnd one of the characters is really into commiting suicide and after a while, it just got tiring. It also overshadowed the characters true abilities which was annoying.\r\nWhy you should watch this show: \r\nThe show picks up in the second seasonand really manages to pack a punch. The MC grows up and the additional characters all appear a lot more interesting. All the organisation gets fleshed out a little more, the it ramps up the stakes. \\n\\n\r\nwhat I'm trying to say is second season is great and you have to get thruogh the first season to reach it. Just do it. It's worth it.",

I'll not discuss any plot elements because the show uses mystery very well and to its success.  If memory serves the first season follows our protag MC Atsushi and the entire season for the most part is focused on him.  That being said the show did a very good job of telling his story but it did repeat a lot of concepts/explanations.  I'm not aparticular fan of someone feeling sorry for themselves, deciding not to feel that way anymore, and then go back to feeling sorry.  The problem here is that the first season did quite a few things this way.  Aside from that the show itself was very much enjoyable, soundtrack work here was done well, art/animation was splendid and the cast of characters specifically in this season were also entertaining (Kunikida and his mannerisms contrasting with Dazai's care-free nature, etc).  Overall the 1st season is very much a show I would recommend and especially so if the intent was to watch the second season.",

            "content": "For me, Bungou Stray Dogs is one of the best animes this 2016 Spring Season. Take that as you want.\r\nBefore anything, you should know something: If you expect seriousness\u2026 you\u2019re in the wrong train. Does this mean that everything is comedy? No.\r\nIf you expect something to do with mysteries and well\u2026 \u201cdetectiveness\u201d you\u2019re going to get HUGELY disappointed (yeah, with CAPS). Probably the only time (the only time I can actually remember) where they do resolve a mystery, they resolve it so quickly that would put L from Death Note in shame. So yeah, in that aspect is pretty terrible. The way I see it,Ranpo is a parody of the typical detective, and the personality of him is not bad.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I think most of the people will hate is the protagonist. Is your generic protagonist with a trauma that lives like shit until something amazing happens to him. And the importance of the trauma that they want to give after some episodes it\u2019s just bad, and some people would agree in thinking that is annoying.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s begin with more subjective things:\\n\\n\r\nIn Bungou Stray Dogs is common for the characters to be in a certain mood, let\u2019s say childish, and in the next second be all \u201clet\u2019s kick some ass with our awesomeness\u201d, and some of the antagonist are not that different, probably the only ones that maintain their characters is Kunikida and Akutagawa, the main villain, they don\u2019t get easily swayed by the situations like most of the characters, but are still affected by them, and you can see it in their expressions. And yes, even the villains change their mood very easily with the expressions of either \u201cYou killed my sister\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to rape you\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAnother important aspect is the comedy, which a lot of people would agree it\u2019s not appealing to everybody. While some say that if you didn\u2019t like the first episode, don\u2019t watch the other ones because you\u2019ll not like it, I disagree, I think you should give it a try till episode 3, if you\u2019re not comfortable then drop it like it\u2019s hot.\\n\r\nThe plot of the series is not that good. Remember Kekkai Sensen? Yeah, the show that just had a detective agency as an excuse to have adventures in the world? Well this is pretty much like it, and of course it\u2019s the most recommended show if you like this one or Kekkai Sensen. Only that in this series, the bad guy acts relatively quickly compared to KS. Nothing great about this villain but it works with the function so that\u2019s something.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is meh~, I can barely remember the OP and ED, because of the first notes, I always skipped them. Nonetheless the ones used in the series as atmosphere is relatively good.\\n\\n\r\nNow the big question is; Why did I gave it a 9? Easy; Because I don\u2019t care for most of the flaws that I mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nI NEVER expect seriousness and detective mysteries in this anime, and in my opinion Ranpo is a pretty likeable character. In fact, all of the characters are likeable, nothing special (except for Dazai and Kunikida) but certainly they appeal to my tastes. Even the protagonist that while it has some flaws I can see some development in him. He starts as a coward that sees no other way to survive than to do bad things, and then at the end of the series he\u2019s a person that has suffered but still looks out for the others because he knows how it feels to be in their position. While the trauma is relatively bad, it works. I also love the way the characters change their personality quickly, it shows me that they feel other things than just their archetypes, makes them a little bit more realistic, and the ones that we see their past we see more development and more reasons of why they\u2019re the way they are. The comedy is not perfect but it\u2019s entertaining and sometimes might give you a little laugh because how absurd it is. And the main problem that I had with Kekkai Sensen is that the plot and villain are bad, in Bungou Stray Dogs they try to fix this, with a decent plot and villain.\\n\\n\r\nAnd MY GOD THE 1OTH EPISODE WAS AWESOME. It was the best episode I\u2019ve seen in months, and hey, I\u2019m following about 24 animes this season and watching some other in my free time, so something good was done in that episode.\\n\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs is an anime that started good, it had some decent moments and some great episodes and a finale that makes you want more. And I personally enjoyed that a lot.\\n",

            "content": "Good enough to spend some time with, I quite enjoyed it without any feelings of it getting dragged out. It was pretty interesting, but if we really look at it we see quite a bit of bad writing. Not the best but absolutely worth a watch.\r\nWhat annoyed me the most was the extreme predictability in this show. It was way, way too easy to know who the mastermind was behind all the accidents, it was also way too easy to see when they were acting in the test at the beginning and who the tiger was. It kinda killed the mysterious vibe completely, it's justannoying when the show is being all pretentious and mysterious when you already know the answer because the author pretty much gave it away with HUGE clues(way too huge and many clues, like the policeman guy, as long as you're not stupid you WILL understand it with his dialogue and garments) and overused patterns.\\n\\n\r\nLet's take the patterns that make it easy to see who did what. Almost every bad guy will always be close by and pretend to be a good guy. They will use the \"can't see the forest for all the trees\" tactic where they try to blend in close to not get exposed. If you notice a minor character that you never saw before and we get scenes with them, they are probably the guilty one. The more scenes and the more talking we get, the more likely it is that they're the criminal. This happens almost every time. A minor character that normally would never get more than a sentence in yet gets talked to(especially if it's talk about the crime) is almost always the one they want to find. It's WAY too obvious. You don't even need to think about it, you will just get that weird feeling that \"something is wrong with this guy\". The author drops clues everywhere, as if to make sure that we know the answer before it is said, destroying any mystery whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nI get that a lot of people love detective manga/novels/anime like detective conan and other stuff because they wonder WHO is the culprit and that the author drops a clue or two to make it possible to get a good guess beforehand. But this author is overdoing it by making it so obvious that it's not just a hunch but rather you KNOW for real and you don't even get that good feeling when you were correct. Usually authors of detective stuff change things around a lot with different patterns and they never use more than a few small clues, but this author fails to do that, he drops clues like there's no tomorrow and doesn't change the pattern between each case. This author should never write a pure detective manga unless he fixes his bad habits, luckily this is barely something that can be called a mysterious detective manga in the first place, it relies on other stuff instead, like action and comedy.",

Though, the comedy side is simple, it is not to the point that you will laugh really hard. The art is sharp and it applies to portray detailed in emotions of the character. Since, I'm a fan of Granrodeo when I heard the opening song I automatically thought it was from Granrodeo. The one who also made the soundtrack of Kuroko no Basket. The sound and seiyuu is very good. I like it as a punk rockeven the closing song really matches the theme of the anime. In terms of characters, I noticed that the author style is to hide the ability of the characters. From the start, the anime will show the characters which are weak they are strong. The powers and name are unique even the personality of each character. For example, Dazai Osamu is an interesting character who likes to suicide, but do not like the pain or torture. I did enjoy watching this anime, although I cannot give it a high score because it has a weakness in terms of story.",

It's not the best art I've ever seen, but it's very similar to Soul Eater.\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nFUCKING AMAZING!! The opening, the ending, the music played during the actions, all of them are amazing, especially the action scene music. I could listen to it for hours. \r\nCharacter: 3/10\r\nI can already tell people are going to be like, \"WHAT?! How canyou give the characters a 3/10?! All of the characters are amazing!\" I agree and disagree. I agree because they are all unique and get their time to shine. I do think it is very creative and original that they're named after famous authors and their most famous work. But there are 2 glaring errors with the characters: backstory and episodes 8-11. We get little to no backstory on them and judging from the ending, I have a feeling that's going to be a similar issue in season 2. The reason I picked episodes 8-11 is because that's when Atsushi and Dazai get kidnapped. 1st of all, they never even attempt to rescue Dazai and the only reason they rescue Atsushi is because the President told them to. This infuriated me and put the characters in a negative spotlight. Look, I get that Atsushi is kind of useless until episode 8 and the agency only took him in because he was homeless, but that doesn't excuse the fact that they knew he was kidnapped and were going to leave him to die! Also, if he was so useless, why didn't anyone attempt to train him to control his ability?! The fact that he's suddenly able to control it is a plot device. Finally, I know that it turns out that Dazai was just on a mission the whole time and could've escaped whenever he wanted to, but come on! You have to admit that it is kind of odd that nobody worried and tried to rescue him in case he got in trouble.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed episodes 1-7, but episodes 8-9 ruined the experience for me. The action scenes are good, though.\\n\r\nFinal score: 5/10\\n\r\nOverall, I had mixed feelings about this series. I loved it and hated it. I'm still going to watch season 2. I think if you liked Soul Eater, you might like this. Otherwise, I think for other people, it might be a hit or miss.\\n",

The graphics are amazing, even when the characters are away from the camera it still looks good. I could compare it to YOI as the graphics in YOI lacked some features when away from the camera (And that's why I mentioned this anime) The music sadly didn't speak to me. The only soundtrack I liked was ''Atsushi Run!\" and the other ones were quite lame I might say. The story is pretty good but this seasononly really introduces the characters not as much the story. The best thing about the anime is that each character is named after a famous person and their abilities are references to the writers's/poets' works and I think this is amazing. When you watch the anime you should always keep an eye on these little details that might be a reference. The whole series is more of a comedy and if you don't like chibi then you might not like this season. The character design is fairly okay, I loved the way every character had it's own style and appearance. I really recommend it BUT you should watch the second season if you want to find sense in this one.",

Although here their detective agency, but rarely the case also had to squeeze the brain. No, but do not be over-emphasized because this anime is more action genre.\r\nFor graphics, wah, this anime is pretty good at graphics. Writers like the scene in every episode where there are words that followed the voice of the Japanese seiyuu (can be different depending, sometimes can seiyuunya Osamu, sometimes Atsushi, sometimes Kunikida) saying the exact same words from the word the word. As the taglinethat differentiate one anime with other anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters into one powerful thing in this anime. Because it is this anime comedy, silliness and jokes always starts from the attitude the attitude of his character. As a hobby Dazai committed suicide, and besides, she also likes ngatain Kunikida and flirting with girls. Kunikida which can not be separated from his hobby of writing. He always carries a book that contains the principles of life and all the things concerning the agency, the case and his personal life. And nearly 100% comedy produced Bungou Stray Dogs come from duet Kunikida-Dazai. So the writer can not imagine this anime without them. Definitely going to be bland without the jokes.\\n\\n\r\nBesides duet Kunikida-Dazai and Atsushi, there Edogawa Rampo which although have not got the strength, he has the most accurate analysis capabilities throughout the agency. Tanizaki who has the ability \"Light Snow\", his sister Naomi, a doctor Yoshino agency that has the power of \"You Can not Die\" until we antagonist, Akutagawa has the power \"Rashoumon\". (NP: The author really curious same ability agency leader. His name is \"All Men Created Equal\", definitely cool that ability. If anyone know a link manga, share dong)\\n\\n\r\nCool, it turns out the name of the anime characters Bungou Stray Dogs came from Japanese literature figure in antiquity. If you do not believe, you try to search in google the name Kunikida Doppo, Dazai Osamu, Atsushi Nakajima, Tanizaki Junichirou, until Akutagawa Ryunosuke is a literary figure. More cool again, their strength comes from books written by the literary figures. Rashoumon is a book written by Akutagawa, No Longer Human is a book written by Osamu Dazai etc. (NP: In the anime, Junichirou Tanizaki Tanizaki had a sister named Naomi. \"Naomi\" itself is one of the book by Junichirou Tanizaki.)",

I think this anime is more suited for a younger audience than a 18+ one, at least in my opinion. Plus I felt like the plot was all over the place for my taste!

            "content": "Bungou Stray Dogs is an amalgamation of every Esper-show you've ever seen with a cast that is so underwhelmingly unoriginal and predictable, engulfed with an overwhelming amount of unfunny misplaced humor.\r\nIt goes without saying that anything Esper related has been lackluster since Haruhi and it's disappointing sequel. It seems nowadays every Esper show has to up the ante in regards to power and not story. Examples being Index; Mob 100 or One Punch, (much less so later, [in the story in regards to the latter if we ever get that season 2]). Stray Dogs ups the ante in the story department but falls flat becauseit's just so boring.\\n\\n\r\n It's story revolves around an orphan who is kicked out of his residence due to him possessing a power to which he doesn't know exists. I can hear Samuel L Jackson quoting his impromptu Bible verse in Pulp Fiction right about now. \"You will know he's an orphan, sayeth the Lord!\" You will be indoctrinated in feeling for this character when it is impossible to do so, coming off as pushed, forced and annoying. This character is not only what I would classify as 'beta' an (or) absolutely unrelatable, but mildly unnecessary for the plot's progression. If this is a self-insert of the mangaka I admittedly feel sorry for this person. (Considering Asagiri Kafka has only ever done anything with this title attached to it however, not so much. [It feels more like a self-loathing insert then.])\\n\\n\r\n Dazai is a very confusing character. He's not only the driving force, essentially the plot's engine, but also a misplaced comedy machine that runs on farts and tasteless suicide jokes. \\n\r\n Let me explain how tasteless jokes are intended to be:\\n\r\nElevated humor works because it deescalates serious situations. Anyone who can make fun of themselves or poke fun at themselves in regards to their shortcomings are smart human-beings, usually intellectuals. Humor not only heals oneself but it can heal other peoples' trauma as well - if they're intellectual enough not to be offended straight away - comedy, after all, is subjective.\\n\r\n Dazai's version of humor has no merit or purpose, he just wants to die for no reason. Maybe it's subjective, but it can't be because it's sarcasm. Instead of it being comedic it comes off as jarring, especially when he winds up in a fishing net at an actual murder scene apparently failing a suicide, (when someone else actually died right next to him in a horrible way.) Yes, this actually happens, so funny. (Not really.) \\n\r\nA coalition of misplaced humor and this will make any sane person question what's actually 'funny' about this show.\\n\\n\r\n The story is just as dull and unoriginal as the characters that inhabit it. In comparison it is literally the 'Owari no Seraph' of Espers, even I'd pick Index over this one.\\n\\n\r\n3.6/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before you read this, know that I have not seen the second season yet, so this review is only on the first season. That means that I haven't seen the whole story, nor the backstories of all the characters. This review is on the first season ONLY.\r\n     Beginning with the story, Bungou Stray Dogs has a fair plot, but it can seem a little random at times. In some parts, the story comes together well and is interesting to the viewer, but in some parts of the anime, it can be a little confusing and haveno relevance to the main plot. Near the end of the anime, most of it does come together, but what makes the story confusing is the characters, which I'll cover in the character section. If you're planning on watching just the first season, then be warned that it ends on a cliffhanger and that you need to watch the second season to reach the end of the story.\\n\r\n     The art is amazing and fits the anime well, I believe, and the sound is also quite good and seems to complement the art and concept of the anime. There are times when the art is better or worse, but it looks especially cool when supernatural scenes come up. In my opinion, the soundtrack is similar to similar anime, such as Gangsta.\\n\r\n     The most confusing part of the story is the characters. I personally liked most of the characters (there were some that I hated with a passion, however), as they are all unique in their own way. The main characters can be a little cliche, however, so if you're not into characters that seem like they've been copy-pasted from Black Butler or Naruto, then don't watch this anime. You'll notice a lot of similarities to other anime characters, and popular ones, at that. It's not just appearance--their manner is the same, too, so really, be warned. It's also worth mentioning that the characters share names with famous authors, but most do not seem to have much connection to their respective author. Alright, now onto the reason why the characters make the story confusing: there is little reason for the characters doing anything. Most characters don't have backstories, and whenever they do something, it makes you wonder, \"why would they do that?\" I would be spoiling the anime if I gave an example, but the cast is hypocritical and they make hardly any sense and many points in the anime. Overall, some characters are interesting and likeable, but most are bland and don't seem to really play a role in the storyline. It's like Mekakucity Actors, where the cast was way too big for the first season. \\n\r\n     Even though I've complained a lot in this review, I found the first season of Bungou Stray Dogs to be very enjoyable, and I basically watched it in a day or two, which is quick for someone who had finals to study for. ^-^\" I would recommend this anime to anyone who enjoyed Tokyo Ghoul (similar supernatural concept, not as much gore), Mekakucity Actors (big supernatural cast), and perhaps Gangsta. or Baccano!, because Bungou Stray Dogs does have to do with the criminal underground to some extent. Don't watch if cliche anime are not your thing, if you greatly dislike gore, or you really don't like really overpowered, bland characters who seem to blitz through every challenge presented to them.",

            "content": "[This review contains minor spoilers. I deliberately wrote one section of this review slightly incorrectly in order to avoid a somewhat major spoiler.]\r\nI am glad that I watched this.\r\nI probably wouldn't recommend this to others.\r\nI have watched this once, subtitled. I have only watched the anime.\r\nI won't watch this again. I will watch the next season.\r\n---- Positives ----\r\nEach episode is entertaining, despite not particularly going anywhere, at a high level.\r\nAlthough characters are mainly roaming around, albeit with organization-related tasks, there isn't much of a high-level urgency of plot in this series. Each win is a little win. Any high-level plot happenings are part of aseemingly eternal game of tug-of-war. Despite that, somehow each episode individually remains interesting to watch. There's good all-around execution.\\n\\n\r\nLittle effort is spent on ability details and interactions.\\n\r\nAbility analysis isn't the focus of this series, and we never find out much about limits of the abilities or how abilities interact with other abilities. I haven't seen any evidence that this series was trying to analyze abilities, so I think it's great how well such details were avoided, to make room for other character interactions. The lack of analysis is a good thing in this series, because ability details and interactions analysis is often done poorly when a series thinks it can juggle that and any other element[s]. As a prime example of an under-analyzed ability in this series, Edogawa's ability seems like it would be even more broken than any characters in the series acknowledge. He's never given insurmountably impossible cases, so we never find out his limitations. We only know that he has a case-solving ability, he only uses it on relatively tame cases dealing with local police, and that, in those cases, it always seems to be sufficient. But if their organization has any larger goals, it seems odd that his ability isn't frequently [over]used to drive the plot [or if it is, then this isn't made clear to viewers]. Later in the series, he ~is~ prompted to use his ability for one plot-intensive purpose, but none of the characters visibly have a revelation that what Edogawa just did was amazingly broken within their world of abilities. About the most we ever get in the analysis department is when Yosano briefly describes a major detail of her ability, which there was incredibly misleading foreshadowing for earlier in the series.\\n\\n\r\nApparently, the characters have real-world parallels.\\n\r\nI am not deeply familiar with literary figures, so I successfully pushed that aspect aside while still enjoying this series. If you like deeply analyzing a series, this aspect may entertain you.\\n\\n\r\n---- Negatives ----\\n\\n\r\nNo aspect sticks out, positive or negative.\\n\r\nWe spend a decent amount of time with Nakajima, Dazai, and Kunikida, in which we get only a moderate glimpse into Nakajima's motivations and past. We spend very a little time with the other characters, just enough to leave an impression. This series had the feel of Durarara!!, but with fewer core characters and less overall direction. It seems that the next season may continue this cycle instead of capping the character count and exploring existing character interactions, motivations, and pasts.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: None, besides the possibility that analyzing the characters' real-world parallels may have added enough depth to make this an astounding work, even without direction.\\n\\n\r\nActually, it may have been better if they explained at least Nakajima's ability progression more.\\n\r\nThroughout the series, Nakajima displays varying amounts of control over his ability. This progression gets almost no acknowledgement by any character, including Nakajima. All we know is that at an arbitrary point in a pinch, Nakajima is able to bust out his ability to varying degrees.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: Maybe. One of the good points of this series is its avoidance of ability analysis, but since Nakajima is the main character, I expected a least a head nod at his progression in controlling his ability.",

They actually reminded me vaguely of Izaya and Shizuo (from Durarara!!)--if Izaya and Shizuo stopped trying to kill each other once in a while to exchange semi-friendly banter, that is.\r\nThe plot is not amazing, but interesting enough. Season 2'sstoryline is clearer and easier to follow.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just that an annoying main character with way too many flashbacks can really ruin an anime.",

Its like the whole season was a prologue. No greater villain, no main plot, no goal. It really feals like a teaser for something greater. A second season could probably be epic, but this 1st one was not. It's still very fun to watch, tho.\r\nThe characters are pretty unique in both looks and personalities. We go from the misterious yet comic dazai to the sadistic medic (forgot her name). Eventhe currently 'main bad guy' isnt plain evl and has his other side. The MC starts as a total loser but grows along the show. Himself, dazai and kinikida are also the comic relief of the anime, and do that very well imo.",

            "content": "I initially became interested in Bungou Stray Dogs after watching a couple teasers and loving the art style. Upon watching the actual anime, I liked it immediately-- the main character, Atsushi, is easy to root for, because his intentions are consistently pure (he has to psych himself up to steal a man's wallet in the first episode, and then ends up saving him from drowning instead...) and he struggles with feelings of abandonment and worthlessness in a way that I think most people can relate to. The viewer wants Atsushi to succeed, and is interested in watching what happens to him. I found myself intrigued.I loved the mix of comedy and serious themes, the supernatural spin on the classic detective story (which surprised me as well), and the twist on the usual finding-a-place-in-the-world narrative. That being said, though my overall enjoyment of this anime is a 10, there are specific aspects of this anime that some people may not like. My reasoning:\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7\\n\\n\r\nI tend to gravitate towards anime that are mostly grounded in reality. This is why I was so surprised at how easily I accepted the idea of \"abilities,\" or powers, that seemingly bless characters out of nowhere. All we know is that Atsushi's ability started recently. The origins of these powers are never explained and don't seem to come from a particular source, which creates a lot of questions (and unresolved plot points). I found it easy to suspend my disbelief and accepted them as fact, however, because I enjoyed the anime so much and wanted so badly to see how it progressed (I haven't looked forward to weekly updates in years). That being said, these are big questions that aren't answered really should be, so it knocks some points off the story score.\\n\\n\r\nA more neutral point: Each character in this anime is based around the lives and works of famous authors (most of them Japanese, so far), from their names to their personality traits and quirks. At first I found this a strange choice, but it grew on me, especially after researching some of the authors named. The parallels are fun to spot, and probably would be a lot easier for someone familiar with Japanese literature. I feel like the obvious parallels might be annoying for some, though.\\n\\n\r\nAnother detail (possible spoiler ahead?): there is a seemingly small amount of death. I feel that many anime watchers become used to senseless death with little consequence (think the clusterfuck in Mirai Nikki), and Stray Dogs definitely strays away from that. Though it does end up seeming unbelievable when characters seem to come out of any altercation unscathed, when anyone does die it is shown as a serious event. In a weird way, this is a detail that makes Stray Dogs seem grounded in reality despite the existence of supernatural powers. In real life, dying is kind of hard, and when it happens, it's a big deal. I have seen some people bring up this point as frustrating, because they don't see the villains as serious when they've fought with the protagonists and everyone ran off safe.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound- 10, 9\\n\\n\r\nI love the art. The animation is beautiful, and the action scenes are absolutely stunning and full of detail. Stray Dogs is a real pleasure to watch; I found myself rewatching fight scenes just to take it all in. Akutagawa's Rashomon is especially well-done, and I found the fight between him and Atsushi absolutely perfect.\\n\\n\r\nI also love the added fourth-wall-esque comments that type out onscreen when characters are introduced-- this really could have fallen through and looked like a tactic to avoid character introductions, but it is a nod to the manga and comes with the comedic benefit of giving Atsushi's internal point of view. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, I thought the music modern and fitting for a supernatural show, and though I'm not the biggest fan of the opening theme (I watch it anyway, though), I love the ending theme and always watch it so I can listen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Stray Dogs really shines! Though Atsushi is introduced as the main character, as the anime progresses, the viewer starts to wonder if everything somehow leads back to Dazai. Dazai's character, to me, is the most intriguing out of everyone. He's introduced as rather silly, quirky because of his penchant for suicide attempts and flirtatious advances at beautiful women, but by the end the viewer is left with a lot of questions about who he really is and what his motives are. His character development progresses at the perfect pace, so the viewer realizes the changes slowly rather than all at once (though one \"twist\" is thrown in as sort of shock value, it didn't change my opinion of him). The opinion change comes with the slowly revealed tidbits of his past and the way he interacts with other characters. The viewer is left with someone a lot more mysterious than he initially seemed.\\n\\n\r\nAtsushi also develops slowly, through (possibly annoying, I know) flashbacks to the orphanage scene holding him back from thinking of himself as worthy. By the end of the season, the viewer can see how much he's grown. His initial worries about himself still exist, and he still has his morals in check completely, but now he seems to find himself more capable. He takes responsibility. The story doesn't center on him as much as it did at the start, making room for other characters, but it always comes back to him in some way. His struggle with worthlessness can feel a bit heavyhanded sometimes, but for the most part I think it's done well.\\n\\n\r\nThe other, more minor, characters are worthy of mention too. Akutagawa's past revealed in small portions, Kunikida's personal struggles, Kyouka's guilt, Higuchi's life, are all well told. Each character has elements of relatability, and nobody really seems black-and-white, good-or-bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely loved it. Even through the issues I've mentioned (unexplained powers? very convenient abilities that let people live through very physically damaging things?) I absolutely loved it. The jokes were funny, the characters lovable, the action well done, and the darker themes mysterious and intriguing. I read the manga because I couldn't wait a week for more of it. I'd highly recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8\\n\\n\r\nI can understand the issues with the plot and some of the pacing, and I can see why some of the characters can be disliked; but the good outweighs the bad for me, and nothing is perfect, so BSD gets a strong 8 from me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "In anime there are times where a show would do one bad thing that gets on your nerves, but thinking that it will eventually stop, you ignore it and trudge onward. That's never how it works. This is the case whether it's a colleague frequently telling jokes with awful puns, a sibling constantly poking at you, or many other situations, and Bungou Stray Dogs exemplifies this quite strongly. Bungou Stray Dogs follows an orphaned kid named Atsushi who attracts misfortune to himself wherever he goes. After meeting Osamu Dazai, he joins the \"Detective Agency\", a small, special agency of superpowered detectives who solve cases inthe city.\\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10:\\n\r\nThe atmosphere that the show creates is the most defining part of this anime. Bungou Stray Dogs often adopts a light, joking atmosphere that fails to amuse because it is so forced. Whenever a gag is made, the characters are drawn in a simple, cartoony manner and the reaction of surrounding characters are of the usual straight-man archetype, either finding difficulty in silliness of the situation, or berating the character making the gag. This is not funny. In fact the one time Bungou Stray Dogs made me laugh was in the penultimate episode in which it ditched this formula for a short period. For another good example of comedy from this season, look no further than \"Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto\" from this season. Each scene is completely outlandish yet treated as if it's almost natural for Sakamoto, which makes it amusing.\\n\\n\r\nBut not only is it completely unfunny, Bungou Stray Dogs wants to have it both ways. This is mostly a serious anime, but it also tries to simultaneously be funny. This only makes it difficult to take seriously. BSD has no idea of how to segment the serious from the non serious. The main example of this comes in the opening episodes when the opposing \"Port Mafia\" launches a raid on the Detective Agency after being built up for the whole episode only for every character from the Port Mafia to job and get chucked out the window of the building at the end. This is what makes Bungou Stray Dogs incredibly hollow. An unnecessary and unnatural tone and a frequent betrayal of expectations only hurts this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\r\nThe characters are slightly interesting but I don't think the story takes full advantage of what is has, at least for now. Each of the characters in Bungou Stray Dogs in based on a historical Japanese author, with Osamu Dazai and Edogawa Ranpo probably being the most recognizable, but I don't think the anime does enough to incorporate that into the story. With a character already set as the base, there is more expectation on what is done with that character but very little happens. We are limited to their ability being somewhat representative of their works. The theme of the characters representing authors ends up being something that is just there, but not at all necessary. Atsushi is particularly disappointing as his characterization is limited to a flashback that occurs at least once per episode in which he remembers his former caregivers at the orphanage kicking him out for bringing them misery. This is an annoying stigma that tends to haunt anime. Pushing a theme of wanting a sense of belonging in a not at all subtle way almost treats the viewer as if they aren't at all intelligent, and tries to draw pity where there is little to none.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10:\\n\r\nIt's unfortunate because Bones has been building this show up for a while with some decent looking trailers and the synopsis of the show is quite interesting. But both the fights and the detective cases don't follow through on the initial promise. Just give me a cool action show with detectives actually solving issues and battling criminals and I'll be happy. Bungou Stray Dogs only added a lot of unneeded fluff to that.",

The story immediatly got way more interesting and I just needed to see more.\r\nBefore I knew I finished the enitre season. I never liked an anime or series so much I lost track of time and watched all of it within a day. That's what Bungou Stray Dogs did to me.\r\nThe story is about this boy called Atsushi Nakajima.

To learn more about his powers, Atsushi joins the agency Dazai is with. But when the enemy finds out about his powers, they do everything they can to get him on their side, even starting a war.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I probably like most about the story is that they also show a lot of details about Port Mafia members and that all of the characters have a backstory. They don't focus on all of them, but the characters aren't shallow.\\n\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs was really enjoyable and I couldn't help but fall in love.",

The plot feels like being all over the place, not actually showing the cases the characters have been assigned into, unsatisfying answers  and always fighting the same opponent without seeing some progress. Also many things are predictable, there are no surprises whatsoever. \r\nMany points are problematic such as the imply of incest, sexual assault andespecially how the traumatic aftereffects of an assault are treated by everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are shallow and indifferent and the character development is not evident. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great and the characters are quite attractive, this is what actually saves it for me.

Atsushi has thought he was kicked out for no reason andthat the were-tiger was following him at first but figured out that he was unconsciously the were-tiger the whole time and has killed some people while being the were-tiger. The killing he has done caused him to have a bounty of 7 billion yen on him which the Port Mafia are trying to catch.

            "content": "Have you ever seen a show so rich that each episode of the show could be a show in itself? I saw one in Bungou Stray Dogs. However, the best shows are made of episodes that play nice together; like a great football team. The episodes in Bungou Stray Dogs don't play nice together. Neither do the show's concepts. Or its characters (I'll get to this part later).\r\nMy path to Bungou Stray Dogs began with a recent character rating event in a club that had two of the show's characters in the top 5. Although the ratings were based off the show's second season, itpiqued my interest. I decided to see the first season before the second (obviously) so I read the synopsis, checked the tags and started the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nI'll just say that I had to recheck the tags after the first few episodes. I'll also cut to the chase and tell you what about the show I adored and what I abhorred.\\n\\n\r\nBe warned: I like to serve the tastiest meals first.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nI completely adored the art of Bungou Stray Dogs. I was immediately taken in by the colourful backdrops and splendid use of light. The backgrounds rarely failed to convey the appropriate moods. I also liked the way flashback scenes were rendered. However, my favourite aspect of the show's art was the fluid animation, especially during fight scenes. In addition to the beautiful environments, the character designs were mostly unique and often reflected their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nHere's an exercise: watch the first fight scene and listen to the music. Did you hear that epic awesomeness? That's a clear 10/10. So why the 6 then? While I liked the jazzy music that fit so well with the setting, some of the other tunes seemed out of place and sometimes drowned out the conversation.  I believe the sound could have been better if it wasn't for the meddling comedy. The opening fit well with the show too but wasn't memorable; the ending, on the other hand, I skipped because it was so out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nOh my! Bungou Stray Dogs had a wealth of characters and each of them was uniquely designed! I often found myself trying to discern what a character's special ability was whenever he/she was introduced. Sadly, the number of characters in the show meant many wouldn't get sufficient screen time and few would be fleshed out. Few of the characters faced internal conflict so the show had little to no character development. It wasn't all bad as there were a few surprises.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, darkness falls...\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\r\nI'd have loved to skip this part because it hurts to write it but I won't abandon my duty. I'll stop with the melodrama; you'll find more than enough of it in the show to satiate you. Add to that the confused mess that was the plot and the lack of any real detective work. To help me get through the show, I had to mentally reorder the tags and replace some of them. Every episode seemed like a random event that had to happen just because. My biggest gripe with the show's execution was the meddlesome comedy that often spoilt the mood at certain moments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nI won't say I enjoyed the show. I feel it was made as a promotion for the second season.",

            "content": "I wanted to drop bungou stray dogs in the middle but i continued thinking that it might get better, well it did but as a whole I DID NOT enjoy this anime.\r\nIn the world of BSD few people are gifted with supernatural powers but for our MC Atushi it was more like a curse. He was an orphan(just like many main characters but this anime actually showed him being one) but was kicked out of orphanage because of his dangerous powers which caused a lot of troubles. He was then recruited by Armed Detective Agency. Port Mafia is another group which is after Atushi\u2019s superpowers.\r\nthemain problem with BSD(for me) was its comedy, of course comedy is not a bad thing it adds lightness to the story when it is really dark but quality, quantity and timing matters and this anime doesn\u2019t care about them all. Same jokes were repeated again and again and they were super annoying and unfunny plus timing was much much worse, it was like this anime wasn\u2019t taking itself seriously. This anime deals with dark stuff such as black markets and terrorism but it just gets vanished by its stupid comedy. But thankfully it got a little better in last few episodes.\\n\r\nCharacters were just Okay there isn\u2019t much to talk about them but there is one repetitive joke for each and other than that there isn\u2019t much to them. Villain was ehhh, MC was ehhh in fact all character=ehhh\\n\r\nAnimation was actually really nice, even though there weren\u2019t many fights but animation still stood out and looked gorgeous. I also liked the character designs. I like the ED more than the OP, music on whole was good enough.\\n\r\nPROS\\n\r\n-Animation was great with cool character designs plus their supernatural powers were unique and cool. \\n\r\n-last few episodes were better\\n\r\nCONS\\n\r\n-Characters were ehhh\\n\r\n-Bad comedy(timing)that ruined everything(well most of things)\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime to you if you want an interesting ,thrilling or action packed mafia type anime watch Bacanno instead.\\n\r\n5 out of 10 (6 is average for me).\\n",

And it fits, as it gives this anime, least to me a bit of a unique feel, I also really liked how the main char slowly grows in his abilities and fight more efficiently over time, I didn't find any real characters that were boring or didn't like beyond those your supposed to hate such as villains.\\n\\n\r\nThe story wasn't perfect and felt a bit episodic with only a bare over arcing story, but it didn't bother me as each of the side stuff was good, and I did enjoy when it got back around to the main one.\\n\\n\r\nI hope and look forward to the next season, it definitely deserves a second one, I want to see more powers and how all the main characters grow and develop.\\n\\n\r\nI give this a 9/10",
