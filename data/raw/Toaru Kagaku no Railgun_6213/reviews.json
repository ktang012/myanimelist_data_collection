            "content": "If ever there was a word in visual media that the general public immediately distrusted, it's \"spinoff\". Experience has proven to many that a show, comic or novel that is derivative of a popular series is rarely as good as the original work, and the DVD bargain basement is littered with titles that were designed with one thing in mind - to cash in on the original work's popularity due to the lack of a valid sequel. Shows like Crusade (Babylon 5), Joey (Friends), Highlander: The TV series, Robocop: The TV series, the horrendous Baywatch titles, and a horde of others all attempted to milkextra profits from a cow that had gone dry.\\n\\n\r\nAll is not lost though, as while it is rare that a spinoff can proclaim itself  to be as good as, if not better than, the original work, there are some shows that do fit the bill. Frasier (Cheers), CSI: NY and Miami, Torchwood (Dr. Who), Mork & Mindy (Happy Days), and a small number of other titles are widely regarded as at least equal to the original works.\\n\\n\r\nToaru Kagaku no Railgun can also add its name to that list..\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Toaru Majutsu no Index this series is not actually based on the light novels by Kamachi Kazuma, but is instead based on a spinoff manga by Fuyukawa Motoi. Unlike the Index series the spinoff focuses on Misaka Mikoto, the \"Railgun\" from the original series. Once more the action takes place in Academy City as Mikoto and her friends are beset by strange earthquakes, conspiracies, friendship issues, and all manner of hijinks.\\n\\n\r\nLike the original series the format of Railgun uses an amalgamation of episodic and multi-chapter arcs however, much like Index, the series is also flawed in terms of its plot because of this. While the series has a reasonably enjoyable story, the tendency to jump from one focus to another like frog on a hot rock is detrimental to the flow of the plot. It's unfortunate as the format is similar to that adopted by GitS: SAC, however the big difference between the two shows is that where GitS: SAC provided food for thought, Railgun neglects this in favour of audience pleasing fillers (if the audience is juvenile that is). \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the plot has some interesting aspects to it, however the lack of a timeframe means that viewers may become a tad confused as to the ordering of events, especially if one tries to correlate the occurences in Index with those in Railgun.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest downside to the format of Railgun though, is the fact that the more interesting aspects of the show are never fully explored due to the lack of focus, something which would have given this show the edge that it really needs.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot may have its issues, the art and animation for Railgun is definitely a step up from Index. The characters follow the design of the manga and the original series, and while this may promote a certain sense of continuity, it's also a downside as well, as the character design becomes a little stale over the course of the show (i.e. too much of the same).\\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds and settings are generally bright and colourful, and the scenery is very much in keeping with the style of the original series. The animation is generally smooth, however there are moments when the characters move in a truly ludicrous manner, something which can ruin a good action scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I do question is the fanservice, as it's clearly surplus to requirements. Granted the series is nowhere near the same level as some I could mention, however this is a showthat didn't really need to go that extra mile just to please the fans, and the story would have been more enjoyable without all the pandering.\\n\\n\r\nRailgun is generally well served in the acting department. Satou Rina and Arai Satomi reprise their roles from Index as Mikoto and Kuroko, and they are joined by Itou Kanae and Toyosaki Aki (Saten Ruiko and Uiharu Kazari respectively), to form the main core of characters. However, while the actresses are all experienced, there are occasions when the roles are really \"hammed up\", particularly when it comes to relationship issues.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, the show has a decent variety of thematic tracks which are generally well used when required, however there are also occasions where the music is clearly at odds with the on screen action. The generally upbeat style of music is reflected in the two OPs and two of the EDs used in the series. The ED for episode 12 is more melodic and has a slightly bittersweet sentiment to it which serves as a nice counterpoint to the ending of that particular arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest surprise of this series is the characters. In a strange irony, they are both the best aspect of Railgun, but also its worst. The lack of plot focus is, in part, made up for by the development of the main cast, especially Ruiko who, in terms of actual character growth, is developed more than the other three girls. Now many fans may argue with that perspective, however I will point out that of the four main girls, it's Ruiko who not only changes the most, but also endures the most.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I did mention that the characters were also the worst part of Railgun didn't I? Well, the reason for this is that while the characters do receive a degree of development, it simply isn't enough to justify their actions. The lack of plot focus only exacerbates the problem, and the show is littered with semi developed characters. In addition to this, the usage of comic relief based fanservice (e.g. Kuroko's behaviour towards Mikoto), washes away what little development had gone before. While the characters are engaging enough in their own way, the show could have done with putting more effort into the plot and characters, and less into making money from the hormone crazed masses.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of the problems I've mentioned, many might think that I didin't enjoy Railgun, when in actuality, I did. The show is entertaining as a no brain action romp, and had the potential, along with Index, to be something truly great. While I may regard Railgun as a wasted opportunity, it isn't actually a bad show at all, and many people may find something to keep them insterested. \\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty though, Railgun, like Index, had a great deal more potential than it actually delivers. The concept of both series is inventive and imaginative, however the execution, especially in Railgun, falls flat due to the desire to make money.The biggest example of how this impacts the show is the level of fanservice throughout the series (one whole episode, for example, is nothing more than a swimsuit buffet). It rapidly becomes obvious that the one of the main purposes of this series is to pander to hordes who love Mikoto, and while giving the public what they want isn't a bad thing, sometimes a show is better off not doing so.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side though, at least Toaru Kagaku no Railgun is one of the few spinoffs that's as good as the original story.",

            "content": "Are the burdens of being special greater or lesser than the burdens of being ordinary? \r\nAcademy City is a city that thrives on those who are espers -- who are special -- whether they already have powers or are trying to attain them. Everyone is reaching towards their ideal self, but some people don\u2019t care what methods get used. The pursuit of the \u201cnext level\u201d is absolute. If our limitations only exist so we can surpass them, should there be a limit to how far we can go to get there?\r\nToaru Kagaku no Railgun, or A Certain Scientific Railgun, follows the events around Misaka Mikotoand her core group of friends and their exploits within the City. They are students, aiming to better their powers as espers. But in a city with a concentrated amount of people with special abilities, it\u2019s only natural for the criminally-minded to try to carve out their own bit of power at the expense of others. To combat such an element and maintain civil order, the organization Judgment exists. Having a free-willed, ace-in-the-hole player like Misaka who keeps people in line all by herself doesn\u2019t hurt either.\\n\\n\r\nMisaka (affectionately dubbed \u201cBiribiri\u201d) is one of the most powerful espers in Academy City. Her ability to generate and manipulate electricity makes her a force that most overconfident thugs learn too late shouldn\u2019t have been reckoned with. Kuroko is her best friend, a crazy and hyperactive girl whose yuri-obsession with her beloved \u201cOnee-sama\u201d is hilarious despite constant rejection. Teleportation of objects (herself included) is her esper proficiency, making her one of the more menacing opponents to come up against, despite the diminutive and cute appearance. Uiharu is the demure techie: easily embarrassed, but a wizard at hacking or culling information from any network. As a member of Judgment, she is often the \u201ceye-in-the-sky\u201d for Kuroko when they take action.\\n\\n\r\nIn a place brimming with espers, Saten is the most fascinating of the four. Her official designation is Level 0. She has no powers at all. Nevertheless, she attends classes and learns all there is to learn about being an esper. The teachers explain to the Level 0s like her that it\u2019s possible to reach Level 1\u2026 but Saten always has a wistful look when the topic comes up. It\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t have that kind of optimism. What does it mean to be that kind of outsider looking in? And how much worse is it to be in the middle of this incredible city, surrounded by so many exceptional people she\u2019d love to be?\\n\\n\r\nAcademy City is almost a character in itself. It\u2019s hard not to fall in love with it. Clean, stylish, dotted with wind generators, a near-futuristic center of learning and advanced scientific research, all the while supersaturated with technology. The juxtaposition of seemingly sentient trash-collector robots and soda machines that only work if you kick them appears to point out that we\u2019ll always have some low-tech around.\\n\\n\r\nRailgun fixes most every glaring problem that tripped up Toaru Majutsu no Index. Gone are Index\u2019s occasional -- albeit entirely useless -- scenes where those involved in the higher echelons of running Academy City were up to some sinister, boring machinations.  Fortunately, Railgun is much more down-to-earth. It also wisely limits the amount of talking that occurs during fight sequences. The action is left to unfold naturally, instead of cramming in reams of idealistic soliloquies that the Index villains probably weren\u2019t even listening to. Finally, it does away with Index\u2019s tendency to tell one mini-arc, followed by another mini-arc, followed by another mini-arc\u2026 ad nauseam that tended to make the show\u2019s overall narrative out of focus and its pace too breakneck.\\n\\n\r\nThe structure of this show, however, is a bit of an odd thing and does deserve to be mulled over. It begins largely episodic with only a scattering of episodes focused entirely on the more serious arc that concludes at the halfway point. The second half is much the same. I say \u2018odd\u2019 because it\u2019s a unique structure I\u2019ve rarely come across. Most non-episodic anime tend to follow the same format as any other narrative medium: an identifiable conflict or targeted goal at the outset; gradual complications along the way; an ending with the inevitable climax and resolution.\\n\\n\r\nRailgun mostly ignores that age-old wisdom. Twice. \\n\\n\r\nThe four or five episodes that precede each climax are strong, focused, and exciting. So if the creators were so capable, why not follow the arcs in every episode? Simply put, it seems to be a stylistic choice -- and one that is as refreshing as it is surprisingly effective. It frees up the story, allows our perspective of Academy City to expand by degrees and the characters a chance to breathe. The importance of the latter cannot be stressed enough. After all, our heroines are living here primarily to learn. It\u2019s a given that attending classes and socializing are going to make up no small portion of their day-to-day lives.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Kuroko and Uiharu\u2019s work at Judgment comprises the larger portion. Most of the fun is watching them work on cases and hunt down perpetrators. Even though Misaka isn\u2019t a part of Judgment, she often forces herself into the role of unofficial member. That she has this proclivity for beating up criminals isn\u2019t so much that she\u2019s a do-gooder, but rather that\u2019s how she finds it easiest to protect her friends. She has an active investment in their well-being and specific meaningful relationships to lose if something goes wrong. This is, of course, all to say that it\u2019s vastly more engaging to watch her and her cohorts, as opposed to a certain bed-headed, misfortunate guy with a chronic Helper Monkey Complex.\\n\\n\r\nI usually don\u2019t mention voice acting, but the consistent excellence is such that I can\u2019t avoid it. Toyosaki Aki easily hits her highest note yet here and in one pivotal moment gives an amazing, touching performance. Even the always-talented Tanaka Atsuko creates a character that is very special. So to avoid a laundry list of names, let me simply say that if some of your favorite seiyuu are involved, it probably wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to urge you to check it out for that reason alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs are as highly-charged as Misaka\u2019s railgun and the EDs are catchy outros after all the excitement. In fact, the songs that bookend the show\u2019s second half are as good as -- if not better than -- the first half\u2019s. And here I thought it was some sort of sadistic tradition in anime for second-half OPs and EDs to be lacklustre. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall soundtrack is just as fantastic. Not only the music itself, but also its skillful use. At one point, a solitary piano begins playing, making us realize that since the episode started there hasn\u2019t been any music. Instead of merely reinforcing the mood, it becomes the subtext that the characters can\u2019t say. Later on when they connect to each other, a similar piano begins. As they are finally able to talk, more and more instruments are woven into the song as they become more and more desperate to express everything they wanted to say earlier.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects are another design element that truly shine. There is something so perfect in the execution of Biribiri\u2019s electricity and Kuroko\u2019s teleportation. It isn\u2019t that Index\u2019s sound effects for these abilities were bad at all, but rather that in Railgun they have been refined enough to be a little addicting to listen to. Likewise, the action of the fight scenes is as much aural as it is visual. Impact is visceral, whether against concrete or someone\u2019s face.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is crisp and beautiful. The visual design is such that your eyes get drawn in, from a particularly huge parfait to some spellbinding fight choreography. Some close-up expressions of the characters are priceless. Unfortunately, certain distance shots of them can dip in quality. It\u2019s a pity given the polished look of everything else around them, but comparatively speaking it\u2019s easy to forgive as it doesn\u2019t occur often.\\n\\n\r\nRailgun is an anime that starts with a cast of memorable characters, tells a very entertaining story, and has the privilege of doing so with laudable production values. The questions it raises are thought-provoking and relevant. Even when the story meanders into a stand-alone episode that has no real bearing on the plot, it is always with a sense of how it fits into the overarching frame. Like its characters, the story breathes. At times it runs; at times it walks. And yes, also like its characters, sometimes it takes that random detour and ends up discovering something wholly unexpected. While science plays a large role in the show, all its elements end up filled with quite a bit of magic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s a certain kind of awesome.",

            "content": "To Aru Kagaku no Railgun is a show that I was pretty hyped to start watching after ending Majutsu no Index, as I thought it would be cool to get some insight on Misaka's life as a Level 5 and get to know better the world the esper's live in. What I got was nothing like that, at all.\r\nThe story is nothing new. At all. There are people who can use powers and this time a whole city is there to develop these. Even though everyone's already full of that premise, doesn't mean you don't have to explain the world build, writers. We only gota glance at what its like living in Academy City. The world was never explained. Why the magic users don't appear was never explained. The \"Level\" system was never fully explained. We saw everything but knew nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThis show uses a specific formula to get its story arcs going, usually introducing a new character that has nothing to do with the conflict at the start, and then starts slowly revealing why this one character in fact has everything to do with the conflict. The wrong in the execution of the show is its constant failures to try to hide it. The episode itself tries to be too unpredictable and almost becomes too predictable, you see. It\u2019s funny how this show tries to pretend it\u2019s not based on arcs by constantly remembering you of what happened in the past. These \u2018flashbacks\u2019 are unneeded and they only serve to take more screentime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story contains many trivial episodes (which is also a screentime problem, like the festival, the visit to the girls dorm, the Judgement investigation episodes of things we already know about etc.) and recycles alot of jokes (like Shirai worshipping Misaka). Not only that, but the filler episodes and the jokes are misplaced, which completely ruins the dramatic mood it tries to develop (just like it happened in the end of episode 22).\\n\\n\r\nThe story ends up having too many mishaps and too little reconnaissances. There are twists and turns on the story but it is never truly developed since the end of every conflict has little impact on the characters themselves (like it was all 'just another adventure'). There was never a climax. There was never a point where I was worried any of the characters would get hurt. There was never an experience that involved the viewers worrying or even caring for the characters. I just accepted eveything that happened and moved on, knowing that in the end everything would go well. And it did. That's why I didn't enjoy watching this series.\\n\\n\r\nWe got more development to the side characters than to the main cast of girls, while Uiharu was the most developed and by far the worst character of the show. We still know nothing about Misaka's past, which is a shame since she has the most screentime of the entire series, and it feels dull to watch her kicking ass without knowing the conflicts she had to pass to obtain such power. The villains are are absolutely horrible. This is another anime that explains the bad guy's actions by the insanity of their minds, like a human can only be mean if they are out of it. It's cringe-worthy, I'm telling ya.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing special. I've seen this style many times, and I don't like the side faces. This is not a judging point, though, I'm just pointing it out, alright?\\n\r\nAnimation is okay. Nothing much to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound work is bad. While the fights are going the same singing tune keeps on repeating undefinitely until it's over. The episodes always start with the same calm soundtrack. Each part always has its own music. This show is so preditable that you can even predict which soundtrack is going to play for each scene, and It's not like they are good at all. The music should help the show by adding another feel to the scenes, and not help you to know what's coming up next, lmao.\\n\\n\r\nThere are shows with no story that can be enjoyable with good characters. There are shows with bad characters that can be enjoyable with a good story.\\n\r\nBut there are no shows with bad stories and bad characters that can be enjoyable. See you in the sequel, Kagaku no Railgun. I hope you learn.\\n",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nYou know, I'm always down for an average anime series. Yes, I admit I have high standards, very few anime even reach an 8 out of 10 for me, but I have absolutely no problem sitting down and watching a show I have every inclination will be just \"kind of alright\". It makes me feel like I get a bigger scope of things in the anime world when I watch these shows, so that includes watching those anime that have made it onto my Plan to Watch list for the sole purpose that for some reason, they have been able toremain relatively in the public's eye even years after they have aired. And yeah, for shows I have watched this way, anime like Guilty Crown, Mirai Nikki and Shakugan no Shana, I get exactly what I expect, from mediocre, to trying-too-hard-to-be-dark, to crap. However, every once and awhile, an anime is able to transcend the image the consensus of the anime community and myself have painted for it, and it always makes for a nice surprise. Now let me stress this, the anime I will be reviewing today, A Certain Scientific Railgun(which will just be called \"Railgun\" from now on for convenience's sake) is absolutely not like that. In this review, I'll tell you exactly how this anime fulfilled every average expectation I had for it, but somewhere along the way, planted the roots for something greater than itself.\\n\\n\r\n   Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, I've been mentally preparing myself for my return to school tomorrow, and after over a month of waiting, it's time for a new anime review. Sorry about that, but these things take awhile to write, and I've sort of spent all my time recently catching up on a lot of things, both with anime and academically. Anyway, it's time to get started, so let's start already.\\n\\n\r\nBefore that though, let's get some potential confusion out of the way first, and talk some technical shenanigan stuff. Now, A Certain Scientific Railgun acts as a spin-off to another anime: A Certain Magical Index and its sequel: A Certain Magical Index II, so for those of you who have seen both shows, keep that in mind that I have yet to see Index or its sequel, so that might be why I don't mention certain things about the franchise or its laws. And if you think that in any way impairs my ability to review Railgun, let me remind you that even if a show is a spin-off, it should still be able to stand up on its own and establish the rules of its universe without any prior knowledge of the sister/father/first series. Additionally, A Certain Scientific Railgun also has a sequel, A Certain Scientific Railgun S, and while I have seen that series(and think it is in every way better), the review today will be exclusively on the first season, though I may reference Railgun S occasionally, probably in the context of saying what it does better than the first season. OK, everyone clear? Good.\\n\\n\r\n  A Certain Scientific Railgun was brought to us by those folks over at J.C Staff, the animation studio that has brought us, as well as the entirety of the Index franchise, Toradora, Golden Time, Shakugan no Shana, and Zero no Tsukaima. It was directed by the one and only Tatsuyuki Nagai, who you probably recognize from his directorial work on both Anohana and Ano Natsu de Matteru, though I personally like him best for directing Toradora, which is still probably one of the strongest slice-of-life/romance I have seen yet. Part of the script was handled Michiko Itou, who had done work on No. 6 and a Toradora OVA, but the script was primarily handled by Miya Asakawa... who hasn't really done anything of note besides a couple episodes of Noein, which I'll be shocked if you've even heard of that(though on a side note, go watch Noein, it's pretty cool). And finally, A Certain Scientific Railgun is 24 episodes long, and aired in the season of Fall 2009, a season which also gave us Kimi ni Todoke and Aoi Bungaku, if that means anything to you. Ok, let's get started with the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAcademy City is a scientifically advanced hub of technology and the arts, apparently about 20 to 30 years ahead of the rest of the world. 80% of the population are actually students, which sounds like someone screwed up somewhere, but in addition to being pretty much the Metropolis of this world, Academy City serves a second purpose. In this world, part of humanity has awakened to a greater psychic power, which is not nearly as exciting as it sounds because the anime doesn't really go for something like Shinsekai yori in which these powers would kind of destroy the world because everyone simultaneously decided they were God now, but more something like a \"what if?\" scenario, as life is basically normal in Academy City besides from the fact that certain people could potentially fire kinetic beams from their hands. These psychic powers are different for each person and could range from teleportation, to being able to see through walls, to just having cats slightly more prone to chase you. These powers are ranged from levels 1-5 based on their power, with a level 0 simply being a normal person without any abilities. Academy City seeks to train the thousands of students to properly develop their powers(people with psychic powers have been deemed:  \"espers\") and understand them, thus why Academy City's population is so unbalanced.\\n\\n\r\nOur main heroine is Mikoto Misaka, a student of Tokiwadai Middle School, and one of only seven Level 5 espers in the entire city, her esper power being an \"Electromaster\", or in simple terms, being able to manipulate or produce vast amounts of electricity. She has earned the nickname \"Railgun\", probably because of her tendency to flick a coin into the air, and launch it with a controlled beam of electricity that is usually capable of settling whatever problem she may have.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot revolves around the daily adventures of Misaka, her roommate Kuroko Shirai, and their friends Ruiko Saten, a level 0, and Kazari Uiharu who attend a different school. As they proceed with their daily lives,  they will begin to uncover a conspiracy about the true purpose of Academy City, and at the same time, stop the ever growing numbers of enemies and factors that seemingly never rest from trying to destroy it. That's a plot I can get behind for the most part, as the story divides its time between several arcs that are usually about some trouble starting to brew in the city, from a gang of esper delinquents or mysterious cases of bombing around the city, and filler that mostly exists to get supporting characters slightly more involved in the narrative and get some breathing room in between the arcs. As I said, this is something I can definitely enjoy, especially when I want to see what crazy esper powers enemies have and how the world can be expanded from the premise, but Railgun, bless its heart, as it frequently switches from filler to plot, forgets to put anything really substantial in either.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem is the show's own writing, in the fact that it just isn't very good. So, I watched dub admittedly, but even if maybe some dialouge is switched around, the story will still follow the same basic structure right? Yes, it will, and the stories Railgun provides for the most part aren't great. You can usually predict how most arcs will end, and usually the arcs themselves are very basic in the way they progress and are structured. It doesn't help there's always at least one piece of dialouge that's worthy of a groan every episode, and no really tension exists since Railgun is undoubtedly not trying to be an overly-dark or serious show. Sure, it has its moments, but for the most part, you can practically guarantee that everything will work out in the end, all the characters will get out unscathed, and even in the darkest hour, the power of friendship will prevail. It's a shame too, because considering the promising premise, some good writing really would've shined here, as seen in A Certain Scientific Railgun S. The filler is pretty bad too, there's really not a lot there, mostly cliches without much character development, and considering how much filler there is in the series, about half of the episodes, it begins to become a problem really fast. And I'm not saying that there is an inherit problem with filler per say, but what I do have problems with is filler that doesn't accomplish anything. Look, I know it is called \"filler\" after all, but I still think that down-time of a story should be dedicated the developing characters or parts of the world that the main plot doesn't have time for. I mean, consider an anime like Bakemonogatari, an anime that practically is 90% filler, but uses nearly all of that time to develop its amazing characters, so when something sort of resembling a plot does kick in, there's all the more reason to care. \\n\\n\r\n  It's not all bad however. I usually have a problem with anime with an arc format with filler in between, because as seen in the original Fate/stay night, the tonal identity of the anime suffers, as it switches too far often between light-hearted filler and plot. Railgun, on the other hand, is able to keep a consistent tone throughout, and whether the characters are having a beach episode, or the plot dips into something actually quite dark, it never feels unjustified. Also, the pacing and structure is actually quite exceptional. Yes, I'm still complaining about the basic structure of any given arc, but the structure of the entire shows fits together quite well. And if we were to continue this extended structure metaphor, the parts of the story all fit together to form a complete picture. There's definitely a sense of escalation in the plot, and every arc plays at least a little bit of a part in the bigger picture. This means by the time we reach the finale, and Misaka is fighting mech suits on a highway, it's easy to see how we got here from the beach episode, which is definitely a positive. However, if I were to pick the high point of the entire series, I still think the mid-season finale was kind of awesome, in both execution and the fact that a lot of things were going down and I thought it was cool. \\n\\n\r\n     It's still not great, the main plot that is, but I'd say it is passable but nothing special. Whatever plot-points or themes the plot does bring up for the most part have been done better in some other anime, and while that's not necessarily a deal-breaker, it's a problem. I do like the plot, and it's probably the best part of this otherwise average show, but I find it hard to give it too much credit. \\n\\n\r\nWe're moving onto characters now, and I will say I really like our main character Mikoto Misaka, because she is pretty awesome. The problem is, I can't tell you why. A Certain Scientific Railgun mostly just establishes her character while Railgun S develops her in all kind of awesome ways, so saying why I like her character might spoil some things I would prefer you weren't spoiled about. So, I'll just give you her surface personality. Misaka, despite being one of the strongest espers in Academy City, isn't arrogant about it, though that isn't too say she doesn't know just how powerful she is in comparison to other espers. She's a little hot-headed, which is good in the way that she will try to end a battle as quickly and effectively as possible by using her superior power to protect her friends. However, it's bad in the way that she's quick to anger, and usually tries to solve every problem by firing a electricity beam at it. It is in this way that her fights between enemies becomes a little more even, so she doesn't seem overpowered in the story compared to others, at least usually. She's also one who tries to accomplish everything herself, and even gets into dangerous situations when there's really no need to, though that might be just an excuse for the anime so it can get an arc initiated. As I said, most of her development is saved for Railgun S, but looking at her character from the first season exclusively, I'd say she stands out fairly on her own, and feels a little different from most main protagonists, which I'm grateful for. \\n\r\n     As for Misika's roommate Kuroko(and the rest of the cast actually), she doesn't hold up as well. Besides from her personality trait of constantly perving after Misaka, there's not a whole lot to her. She's a member of Judgement, a sort of student run police force, which allows her to show off her more serious side. It is also through Judgement that allows Misaka and the rest of the cast to get involved in the plot, as they help Kuroko and Judgement stop whatever thing is terrorizing the city. The only thing I'll give Kuroko, besides that she is kind of annoying, is that she is undoubtedly the person who knows Misaka the best, and is usually the first to scold Misaka at her tendency to rush into situations without thinking. \\n\r\n     The problem I have with Saten is that she is kind of useless. At first, I thought her role would be to be, despite not having any esper powers, the voice of reason and intelligence. But she's not really that either. She's just kind of... yeah useless. And as for her friend Uiharu, I don't really have much to say about her either. And that is a big flaw when nearly all of your main cast is sort of under-developed, and a big reason why you'll see the number you do at the end of this review. \\n\r\n     Luckily, the rather large supporting cast pick up a bit of the slack. From the members of the actual police force Antiskill, to Misaka's classmates, to the various adversaries that our main characters meet along the way, everyone has something to bring to the show. Hell, even the main character from A Certain Magical Index: Touma Kamijou will show up occasionally, and usually have very amusing interactions with Misaka, bringing up her well hidden tsundere trait for all to see. He's mostly just there as fan-service(the other kind) however, not really contributing to the main plot besides from one occasion, but rather distantly mention side-characters from Index and so on. The standout however, is Dr. Kiyama Harumi, who is probably the most well developed character in the show, at least in season 1. I can't tell you her exact role in the plot due to spoilers, but her motivation and personality are really well defined. I also like how she is just a little \"out of it\", sometimes asking off-topic questions or not reacting to situations in the way a normal person would.\\n\\n\r\n.C Staff have always been consistently good with their animation, but if I had to say, A Certain Scientific Railgun is probably one of their best works. The futuristic aesthetic they've given Academy City looks crisp and clear, and there is plenty of nice backgrounds to go along with it. Speaking of backgrounds, occasionally you'll see these wide sweeping shots of the city sky-line, and you can tell the effort that the production company have put into them; you could take a snapshot and put it as your wallpaper they look so nice. Fight scenes between espers, especially fights with Misaka are always cool to watch, but even ones without her, J.C Staff usually find a way to make it interesting to look at, and all around, everything is awesome, except maybe the character designs, which while original, never really did much for me, but that's a nitpick. And it only gets better, as I think I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Railgun S has the best animation that I've seen J.C Staff produce.\\n\r\n     I've been listening to the OST the entire time I've been writing this review, and I hardly even registered it. The music, done by Maiko Iuchi, sounds very bland and uninteresting, filled to the brim with all the slice-of-life jingles you've heard a million times before. And yes, there is music to compliment the more serious parts of the series, but it's nothing worth listening to twice. The only thing I'll give on the music side of things is that the both OP's, and the first ED of the anime are rather nice, and have good animation to boot. There's also two songs: \"memory of snow\" and \"Late in autumn\" done by the band \"fripside\", that are rather serene and calming, and at least beat out the counterparts by Iuchi on the OST that seek to achieve the same feelings. And even if some voices are annoying, I can speak well for the dub.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the flack I've had to say about this show(and I had a lot), I'm glad I was introduced to this franchise. There's a lot to like, and a lot to dislike, so ultimately it just settles around average, but it is enjoyable, with hints of actual quality spread thin throughout the series. If I had to give only one compliment to A Certain Scientific Railgun, or even the whole Index franchise as a whole, I'd say it is highly approachable. I think at least everyone can find something to like here, with the well balanced genres of comedy, action and scfi-fi. That's not something I can say for just any anime, so well done Railgun on being able to achieve at least that. At the end of the day however, I'd say go watch Railgun even if you can see yourself only moderately liking it. There is not a lot of franchises that get better as they go on, and while it's true that I can speak for both seasons of Index yet, I can for Railgun, and there's nothing much better than a steady rise of quality in a show. So yeah, both seasons, I ultimately recommend it. Go see them guys.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Never trust anyone with a lab-coat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)",

            "content": "Back in January, I watched a just licensed anime called \"A Certain Magical Index\". Which I thought was a pretty good show that was worth watching, with it's interesting world and likable characters, though at times it got too complicated and hard to follow at times. Though what made it worth watching was the secondary character, Mikoto Misaka. In a sea of basic stock anime characters, she was the most interesting out of them. Plus, watching her made me want to see more of this character, including her friend, Kuroko Shirai. But seeing how she was popular enough to get her own spin-off, I'm notthe only one. So, will this more Scientific \"Certain\" show live up to my expectations, or will I end up disappointed? Let's find out.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story (9/10) \\n\\n\r\nNow let me say that the scientific side of this world is a lot more easier to follow then the Magical side. Academy City is a city in which it's technology is three decades ahead of the rest of the world, where many people come to train to be espers. Some of which were born with such powers, whiles others were originally ordinary folk who had the potential to develop them. The ranks range from Levels 0 to 5. 0 being the lowest (As in, have no powers) while 5 being the highest, in which there are only 7 espers ranked Level 5. One of them being our main heroine, Mikoto Misaka. She is joined by three other friends, including her best friend and roomate Kuroko Shirai, Ruiko Saten, and Uiharu Kazari. All four of them go on action packed adventures exploring the more darker aspects of Academy City, as well as having their friendship for each other help them get by.\\n\\n\r\nThis side-story does a very good job explaining the basics and details of being an esper in this scientific city. Not only that, but it also explores the more psychological side of being an esper. If you replace the esper dream these girls have and replace them with your own, you would know how many of the characters would feel. You relate with working hard for your goals, or the fact that while you may try your best, you would still be stuck at square one. But that's were I talk about the themes of this show, and let me tell you, they're REALLY good. The main one being the power of friendship. The lessons of relying on one another, no matter how empowered you are, you will always need help. Or how your true friendships are much more important then things that you think are more important, but they really aren't. Not only that, but it has strong messages of \"Working hard for your goals\", \"Never giving up\", \"Be true to yourself\", \"Try again\", and \"Always stand up for your friends.\" All of which are very helpful in life.\\n\\n\r\nI even give credit to the fact that the fanservice does take a back seat in this. Okay it's STILL there, but it's actually treated as a small part of the show. The bigger part being the characters, their relationships with one another, and their inner hardships that they fight to overcome. Not to mention the story arcs having unique ideas that rely on sci-fi complexity, and have a subtle connection with one another. Filled with twists, backstories, and some very sentimental moments. And because that this is a slice-of-life show with a lot of sci fi elements, it really has that Haruhi Suzumiya-vibe to it. Achieving on every aspect Magical Index only did \"Okay\" on, makes this show one of the most surprisingly deep I've seen in any medium.\\n\\n\r\nThe Dub (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow we get into the more....\"Controversial\" side of this. At least in it's overseas release. Ever since the dub's trailer, it's gotten a lot of hate towards dub haters. (Which is not surprising) Me? Well, I actually tolerated it, though that's not to say I think it's perfect. Brittney Karbowski I thought was terrific as Mikoto Misaka. Capturing her tom-boyish attitude fairly well. Plus it's funny to hear her as Ayu Tsukymia and then as Mikoto. Kuroko Shirai was actually the first time I heard Alison Viktorin's voice. Now her english voice for Shirai might not be as funny to listen to as her sub voice, it still suites her character just fine. Plus, changing \"One-sama\" for \"Sissy\" was because the latter sounded more familiar towards American and European countries. Also, it means the same freaking thing, so calm your tits dub haters! Then there's Cherami Leigh as Uiharu. Now she is a character type that Leigh would usually play, just changing the little girl to a teenager, and she does an okay job as Uiharu. At least to a point where I can tolerate it. Plus, is it me, or does her Uiharu voice kinda sounds like Lisa Simpson at times? Last but not least is Brina Palencia as Saten, which is where I think most of the complaints come from. People complained that she sounded like a tomboy just like Mikoto. While I can somewhat see where they're coming from, I think there might be a reason to this. I think Saten's personality is in the middle of girly-girl and tomboy. She's not to much of one side, but not to much on the other either. Now Brina........only did a good job on it. Not great, but her voice for Saten can be fun to listen too. Funimation isn't always perfect with their dubs, but they STILL work hard on them. And their work here does show. At least to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow here is where we get into the strongest aspect of the show. Or in some cases, the heart of it. You see, the problem with Index's cast is, (While they are okay) they're for the most part copy/paste anime archetypes. Ones that we're use to seeing all the time at this point. Railgun's characters on the other hand, (While having their tropes) are a lot more 3 dimensional and relatable.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start out with our main character, Mikoto Misaka. Who on the outside, looks like your typical stuck-up girl due to her high ranks as an esper. But on the inside, we learn that she's really nice, flawed, and very identifiable. We learn that she was originally a Level One esper, but thanks to hard work, got to where she is now. Plus, her personalities very unique for anime standards. Sure tomboys are fairly common, but she's given reasons to act like that which can be seen for yourself while watching. Also, just because she's one of the most powerful espers in Academy City, doesn't mean she'll prevail. Which makes the action scenes more intense, and her friends very useful when the times right.\\n\\n\r\nThere's Kuroko Shirai, who's Mikoto's best friend and might have a possible love for her. Which could get annoying to some people, (And is mostly there to turn on the male watchers) but there is more to her character then that. We learn that she's very devoted to her role in life, her friends, and everything else that's important to her.\\n\\n\r\nKazari Uiharu is the Judgment officer along with Kuroko. Which is basically a junior police force in some cases. She does have the look of your typical moe girl (With a bouquet of flowers on her head to boot) but she's still just like the other characters. She's the voice of reason to Saten, and the straight girl to Kuroko's shenanigans. Plus, she's very devoted to every friend she makes, and I'm not just talking about the other main three.\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least is Ruiko Saten, who has to be my second favorite character. Why? Well, I feel that she's the one that's the most relatable of the four. She's known to be a Level 0 esper, which causes her to think that she's insignificant compared to her friends. Not only that, but no matter how hard she would try, she would always get little payoff to her hard work. Which causes her to make some decisions that would go against what's right. You know what? That makes her a very great character. She does make mistakes, and she does get into trouble for them (Mostly for the first story arc), but I can connect with her, understand her, and really care for her that way. I mean, I would do the same thing. But it's her growth as a character that makes you very happy when something good happens to her.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the main 4 girls are so colorful and unique (Only relying on one familiar character trait) and their friendship with each other makes the heart of the series, there are many times that I'm looking at a genuine soul. Now there are other characters in the series, but I feel that you just have to see them for yourself due to spoilers, and they aren't as worth mentioning as the main four. But other then that, this is a near-perfect cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis has some very catchy opening and ending theme music. \"Only my Railgun\" and \"LEVEL 5 -Judgelight-\" really due capture the esper and scientific feel of the show, while \"Dear My Friend\" captures the shows theme of friendship. \"Real Force\" has to be my second favorite song from this, the first being \"Dear My Friend\". Plus, there's also a special ending song for episode 12, but I wouldn't dare spoil it for you. You just have to listen for yourself. Every opening and ending theme has great visuals making you feel pumped up for what you're about to see. Not only that, but it does reflect on some of the aspects and themes of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nA Certain Scientific Railgun managed to live up to my expectations, and more. Proving to be much more entertaining than the series it spun off of. With it's more interesting and easier to follow side of the world and ideas they create, inventive ideas filled to the brim with sci-fi complexity, a lovable cast of charming characters, and some of the best themes that could be taught through anime. It's like \"Haruhi Suzumiya\" meets \"Azumanga Daioh\", and I do highly recommend this to anyone who's a fan of those two shows, or at least is a fan of slice of life animes. Now, it's kinda required to watch A Certain Magical Index first, just so you can understand the cameos from that series, as well as the fact it makes a good introduction to the character of Mikoto Misaka. Plus, a second season of this just started 2 days ago, and it's suppose to focus more on the Sister Arc from Mikoto's point of view. Which sounds VERY interesting, since she IS the heart and soul of that messed up project.....which you just have to see for yourself that is. Overall, it's one of my new favorites.",

            "content": "To be honest I don't find this show worth watching at all..\r\nThe abilities granted to characters are mostly random, lack any sense of logic, and don't contribute to the story at all, which is already weak. \r\nEvery episode, something goes wrong so that the esper team has to deal with. But since the arc of the Strip Lady who tried to save the her Error Children, it's always the protagonist Railgun that has to reap what she sows, handling problems one after another created by fault of her own immaturity, naivety, etc. (I want to say stupidity)\r\nOverall, all characters are weak in all ways, childish,spontaneous, fanatical, etc. even though they presumably possess great skills and knowledge in a futuristic world, e.g. hacking computers (lolz). Moreover, there is no particular growth in their personalities throughout the show. The character Saten may look like playing a triggering role in one or two arc(s) but her contribution to the story remains next to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nFor the espers, if you think about it, if you were in their shoes, you could even use those abilities in much better ways, you bet. Therefore, there's no feel of optimism or logic in both the flow and details, thus this isn't worth any entertainment value.\\n\\n\r\n3/10",

            "content": "I thought i'd write a review for the guys out there that have watched the parent story Index.\r\nI was 100% sure i would never watch this, it looked like a little girls show, and I wasn't wrong.  I was pretty bummed there was no news for a third season of Index, so I thought I'd give this a go and test the waters.\r\nIf you liked Index, you're almost sure to like this.  I got caught up in the clean lines and perfect pacing all too quickly.  Something about this anime series speaks to me, and just like Index, a show I alsowas skeptical about seeing, this Railgun grabbed me and didn't let go.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is so well connected that it rewards you for paying attention.  The writing is clever enough to pull it through even the lowest, slowest times.  Whle being about the adventures of middle school girls, it's hard to look at it like that.  The action was probably more central than the Index series.  Surprisingly, there may have been even less drama than Index as well.  All of the elements come together so well that you will soon forget about the context and focus squarely upon how much fun the show is.\\n\\n\r\nThe only major drawback is that the first railgun series does contain a few filler episodes, and in those, if you're a guy, it's definitely hard to relate.  However, the comedy and wit really prevails even through these so that it was next to impossible for me to skip an episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe other minor drawback is that it does touch on the cheesy side, but it was so rewarding i didn't really care.  \\n\\n\r\nYou know the art is top notch, the characters are all interesting, highlighting not just their strengths but their weaknesses. And while the show mainly focuses on Railgun, it's not shy about letting the supporting cast do some heavy lifting.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure I'll get some heat from my high score, but rarely have i seen an anime that mixes the elements of a good story so well.  It's, dare I say, even sophisticated enough to vault over shows that you may already hold in high esteem.  Not everyone is going to love it, but I find it hard to imagine that you will hate it.",

            "content": "When it comes to anime in general, more than often is there a tendency to get turned off by the words \"spin-off\". This is especially true when it involves taking an intense, action packed parent story and drawing from it a spin-off that is mostly about a group of cute girls doing cute things. After completing Index two years ago, I was all pumped and ready to get into Railgun, but I never really did that until now. I for one, was really attached to the characters of the parent story at that point, and it bothered me that we would not get to seeas much of them here. Mikasa Mikoto struck me as a very interesting character from the very start, but not interesting enough to follow for an entire series on her own. I watched the first episode of Railgun and thought to myself  \"Nope, not today I don't.\" It seemed interesting enough given the setting, but I was completely turned off by the drastic change in tone when compared to Index. Now that I have come back to the starting line and pulled my way through A Certain Scientific Railgun, my thoughts about the show were completely changed. After completing it, I can say that watching the show was quite an enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe show centers around four girls (Misaka Mikoto, Shirai Kuroko, Uiharu Kazari and Saten Ruiko) who come together in Academy city and end up becoming the best of friends. For me, the setting here was as interesting as ever. I was never a big fan off the magic side of the world of Index because of the direction that it veered off to, but the science side was always really interesting to find out more about. Inside academy city, we are introduced to a broad variety of characters as they go about in their daily lives in the city. In academy city, it seems that the amount of respect you receive by other people in general is heavily paralleled by the amount of power that you possess. Those that possess amazing power are highly praised (for example: other people's reception of Misaka in many cases) and those that lack it are often driven to lead their lives into more undesirable directions. There is a lot going on at all times in this lively city, and the city would often be plagued by various spontaneous occurrences. Those that keep order are divided into two groups: Judgment (those who aid in keeping daily order) and anti-skill who work more like a combination of the police and the military. We are introduced to quite a few characters throughout the show, and many of them were actually pretty interesting. But more importantly, the development of these minor/major characters has really done an amazing job of bringing the setting to life.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere isn't a whole lot to interpret about the relationship of our four main characters. Because of their bright and enthusiastic personalities, they easily get along with each other ever since their first meeting. However the ridge that really divides our characters is once again, a difference in skill level. Standing at the top is Misaka Mikoto, a level 5 esper who is the 3rd strongest in all of academy city. Her roommate Kuroko is also a strong level 4 teleporter (I just love this ability) and a game-changing member of judgment. As nature would have it, Uiharu and Ruiko (levels 1 and 0 respectively) do feel a certain degree of helplessness when it comes invert desire to become stronger. While they would continue trying their hardest to improve their abilities, this difference in power is what would eventually prompt Ruiko to use the level upper as a shortcut to becoming stronger. As a result, her friends are able to finally understand a bit of what she is going through as someone who completely lacks power.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere is of course, a degree of fanservice in many forms in the series as well. One of the more obvious cases lies in Shirai Kuroko's perverted nature and the obsession that certain characters other have with the type of underwear that other girls wear. Episodes like the one where they become swim models are mostly geared towards fanservice but they do end up being decently enjoyable one way or another. On the other hand, we are occasionally offered a glimpse of our main characters from Index, leading fans of index around with a carrot in hand. It was pretty nice to see Touma and Index again, but they are not really involved in the plot at this point.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe overarching plot that develops throughout the series revolves around Kiyama Harumi as she desperately tries to save the lives of the child-errors she was once forced to teach and later abandon to an experiment she had no prior knowledge of. As someone who is willing to go to the ends of the earth to save these children, she certainly takes many drastic measures. I really felt bad for her when Misaka looked into her past though, because who wouldn't experience agony after going through what she did.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe antagonist in the last arch, Threstina, really made me roll my eyes a bit though, because it honestly would have been better in my opinion to make her \"betrayal\" come as more of a shock. Instead, they have her with a menacing grin in the background since the very beginning, so there was no surprise there. Though I guess it would be hard to disguise that level of insanity.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe battles play out pretty nicely throughout the story. The esper powers are really interesting to observe given the wide variety of powers that are introduced. My favorite is Kuroko's teleporting power. It seems so useful on a daily basis while also being a lethal weapon in battle. Being a level 5, Misaka's power does stand out quite a bit. Her control over electricity is supreme to an extreme point. I must say, I raised my eyebrow the first time she used her electricity to stick herself to the wall. The final battle came in a series of intense sequences. The power play shown was interesting, and we get a glimpse of Kongo Mitsuko's level 4 ability as well (which is a pretty nice ability as well).\\n\\n\r\n\tProduction value-wise, the animation was really solid throughout, and the art was really nice and pleasant to look at. This is something that I think has really improved since Index. Overall, A Certain Scientific Railgun was an enjoyable anime to watch, and we see lot of development of a world that I have indeed become quite invested in.\\n\\n\r\nMy score: 7/10 Good~\\n\\n\r\n\tI really look forward to anything else that the author has in store for the future.",

            "content": "This review will cover both seasons of A Certain Scientific Railgun.\r\n\u201cYou use other people\u2019s power as an excuse for your own weakness. There\u2019s almost nothing more pathetic than that.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Kuroko\u00a0Shirai.\r\nAnime spin-offs to well-known series\u00a0are a tricky beast to execute. On one hand, anime spin-off can take all the things that the original series established and expand it by bringing in new concepts and ideas to the table aka\u00a0Digimon\u00a0Tamers. On the other hand, they could run the high risk of repeating the same mistakes that set original show made or even make worse ones in the progress cough Soul Eater Not. Thankfully A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0least, forthe most part, fixes almost everything that I hated about A Certain Magical Index. Now when I first heard about\u00a0Raildex\u00a0series I was pretty intimidated of the timeline of the series because it was pretty confusing. When I asked people on the net about what series should I start in the\u00a0Raildex\u00a0timeline. Many of them pointed toward A Certain Magical Index because they said I would have a better understanding of the story. However, after hearing mixed opinions of A Certain Magical Index on the net I decided to freely bench watch both season A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0series and I absolutely loved it. Now as the years went by as I started to see more anime as well buying anime on\u00a0Blu\u00a0Ray and DVD and re-watching it a month before Season 3 of A Certain Magical Index my opinions for both Seasons of A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0has changed. Don't me wrong I still think it's a good series and I still it's one of J.C Staff better shows I just don't love it as I use to. Now with that said let's dive in.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nIn the futuristic Academy City, which\u00a0is made\u00a0up of 80% students, many of who are\u00a0espers\u00a0possessing unique psychic powers. Mikoto\u00a0Misaka\u00a0is an\u00a0electromaster\u00a0who is the third strongest of a mere seven\u00a0espers\u00a0who have been given the rank of Level 5. The series focuses on the exploits of\u00a0Mikoto\u00a0and her friends;\u00a0Kuroko\u00a0Shirai,\u00a0Kazari\u00a0Uiharu, and\u00a0Ruiko\u00a0Saten\u00a0and the adventures at Academy City.\\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings for the story for A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun. Before I talk about the stuff I didn't like let's talk about the stuff that I liked first.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters compared to Index the story is a lot more clear and focused meaning there isn't much\u00a0cryptic stuff that goes is happening especially in the background side of things.\\n\r\nThe one thing that I really liked about A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0is the character interactions. They are pretty funny for the most part. Most of the characters have great character chemistry with each and the conversations between the four girls as well the other characters inducing the villains were pretty entertaining.\\n\r\nAnother that I liked about the series is how the series was able to explore its themes because Outside the slice of life stuff the show tackles a lot of serious themes of cloning, loneliness,\u00a0levelling up,\u00a0Perseverance and the show goes a great job attacking themes in sets arcs of the series.\\n\r\nThe Sister's\u00a0arc\u00a0of\u00a0Railgun\u00a0from Season 2 is easily the best thing to come out from this series because that arc itself was not only well written and directed but it also beautifully characterize\u00a0Misaka\u00a0as a character. It's such a shame that the rest of the arcs in\u00a0Railgun\u00a0minus the pretty good Level Upper Arc were not that great as they are sadly pretty average at best\\n\\n\r\nNow with that, all said let's talk about the show flaws because there are a lot of them that at times plague the series.\\n\r\nFirst up the pacing. Compared to the ridiculous fast pacing in A Certain Magical Index, A Certain Scientific Railgun\u00a0is much slower and while I appreciate the slower pacing of the show and I will admit the show took good advantage with the shows slower pacing as it was able to\u00a0establish\u00a0the world as well popularly develop its characters. The problem with the show pacing is how at times the show can ridiculously at times to a point where am just watching inferior K-on clone While this is not a problem in season 2 as that season was for the most part pretty well paced\u00a0its\u00a0season is where it kinda becomes a big issue in some areas.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly the\u00a0worldbuilding. Now I admit A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0actually tries to properly establish\u00a0its\u00a0world compare its parent A Certain Magical Index but the problem is that it's not properly explained to the viewer.\u00a0The function of\u00a0academy city, how\u00a0esper\u00a0powers work none of that\u00a0is explained\u00a0or they kinda but it was done in a half-ass faction where the show only explains the first half of the information about the world while the second half of it doesn't get expanded at all. I honestly don't know why this franchise has a difficult time about properly establishing its own world to the viewer. Image if\u00a0Fullmetal\u00a0Alchemist 2003 decided to completely cut out the intro in episode 1 explaining of how alchemy works and instead\u00a0the first scene of\u00a0Fullmetal\u00a0Alchemist 2003 has Edward and Al drawing circles in the ground as talking about alchemy thing. You would be completely lost and as a result, the viewer would become very confused about what is going on. Lucky this problem, for the most part, is\u00a0tamed\u00a0compared to Index as this problem doesn't happen as\u00a0often since this show most part, is a character-driven and because of that, I can kinda let this problem side here. I just hope that Railgun\u00a0Season 3 fully fixes that problem.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the filler. Now am no manga elitist where I shit on any anime adaptation because it's doesn't follow the source material perfectly, in fact, I open filler in anime as long they\u00a0are done\u00a0right as\u00a0well-being\u00a0entertaining to watch. The filler in\u00a0Railgun\u00a0says otherwise. The filler in the second half of season 1 was okay at best and while the writing and directing was clearly not as good as the first half it was still pretty fun and decent experience. However, I cannot say the same thing for season\u00a02 filler\u00a0aka Silent Party\u00a0arc\u00a0because that was pretty bad. It was so bad that fans of the series stated that\u00a0Railgun\u00a0S2\u00a0ended at episode 16 and\u00a0to be\u00a0honest I didn't watch the Silent Party arc on my first watch as my friends that arc was the second coming of Beach arc of Nadia The\u00a0Secret\u00a0of Blue Water which I\u00a0absolutely\u00a0despised. I did\u00a0eventually\u00a0watch it on my re-watching from start to finish and let me tell you I wanted to remove my\u00a0Blu\u00a0Ray disc on my\u00a0PS4\u00a0because that arc was so badly\u00a0scripted\u00a0and contrived that it really annoyed me to no end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall while the story has a lot of good\u00a0moments\u00a0as it did gave us the amazing sister arc it's was\u00a0unfortunately\u00a0hindered\u00a0quite a bit thanks to its lack\u00a0of\u00a0actual\u00a0explanation\u00a0of the world as we the crappy Silent Party arc.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nWhile the story suffered\u00a0quite\u00a0a bit in terms of wiring and directing the characters for the most part completely make it up.\\n\r\nMisaka\u00a0is\u00a0an awesome\u00a0character that I really liked. Not only she is a pretty well-written character especially in Season 2 where she greatly develops as a character but she is a very relatable both narrative and personality. Now at first, you don't know much as and you know that she is one of the most powerful espers in Academy City however as the series progresses you will start to see that there is more going on into her character outside of her reputation. For example despite being one of the most powerful espers in Academy she has this incredibly childish tastes that she tries to cover up due to her reputation as is obsessed\u00a0with her frog character named Gekota that look it came straight from kindergarten. This detail alone really makes Misaka a more\u00a0relatable character as that's how a lot of people react to the guilty pleasures especially of her age where is 14 years old. As for her development in the series well I sadly can't talk about because that would be a massive spoiler for the whole series but what I can say it is emotionally driven and\u00a0well thought out. Overall Misaka is an amazing character and she is easily the second best thing to come out this anime right behind the amazing Sister Arc of Season 2 aka Railgun S\\n\\n\r\nKuroko\u00a0is an interesting character because she is the character that seemed to a lot of hate and while I understand people don't like\u00a0Kuroko\u00a0I don't think that Kuroko is as bad that many people say she is. In fact, after my re-watch, I actually started to like her.\u00a0 Yes, she\u00a0may be\u00a0annoying at times thanks to lesbian loving gag about\u00a0Misaka\u00a0but when she's not doing that act she is actually\u00a0a\u00a0likeable\u00a0character who pretty good development in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nRuiko\u00a0is a pretty great character and she's easily my favourite character in the show that is not\u00a0Misaka.\u00a0 I really how the show devolves into her internal conflict that she is has no\u00a0espers\u00a0ability and how she to live/deal within a city that\u00a0espers\u00a0are the number 1 quality that people\u00a0are measured\u00a0by. It was one of the few things that I actually was\u00a0interested\u00a0in this\u00a0esper\u00a0world.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have my least character out of the main four Uiharu.\\n\\n\r\nShe was just a\u00a0bland character on-screen who did nothing for the show plot expect acts like the four-wheel for the group while she isn't bad or anything as in her character interaction with the other girls was pretty\u00a0solid but other than that she was, unfortunately, pretty one note.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters in\u00a0Railgun\u00a0they are actually pretty\u00a0solid.\\n\\n\r\nTouma\u00a0who is the character that I grew to hate in the Index series is actually pretty tolerable here as he\u00a0doesn't\u00a0show up\u00a0all that much in the series and even when he does show up\u00a0he's actually a pretty decent guy. It's such a shame that we don't see this\u00a0Touma\u00a0in his own series.\\n\\n\r\nAccelerator is a pretty fun and villain that I enjoyed a lot in the Sister arc of\u00a0Railgun\u00a0S. The same thing can apply for\u00a0Harumi\u00a0for season 1 in\u00a0Railgun who is a pretty good villain in her own right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters, for the most part, were excellent and very enjoyable.\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0is excellent.\\n\r\nJ.C Staff did a fantastic job with the art and animation as the show is very smooth and clean not to mention it's very well animated. The character designs while the same from the original series is much sharper this time around especially in\u00a0Railgun\u00a0S where certain scenes the characters look absolutely beautiful.\\n\r\nThe animation in The show is very good\u00a0that is filled\u00a0with smooth movement and wonderfully animated fight scenes.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0is pretty good as they all work well with the show setting and actions scenes.\\n\r\nAll the opening and ending themes in the show were great and very enjoyable to listen.\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe subversion was pretty good for the most part as it filled with solid\u00a0Seyiuu\u00a0performances though I was not a fan of\u00a0Kuroko's Seyiuu\u00a0as I thought she overdid it to a point where she sounded like an old woman.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub, on the other hand, is actually very good.\u00a0Brittney Karbowski did a fantastic at voicing Misaka as she brought more life and personality to an already awesome character and the rest of the cast did a great job with the roles that they were given\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nSo after re-watching A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0what do, I think about. Well, I liked it. While I still don't the series has held up as other animes that I re-watched in the past like\u00a0Toradora, Outlaw Star\u00a0Ouran\u00a0High School Host Club and\u00a0Cardcaptor\u00a0Sakura\u00a0but still, it holds up more than the likes of Angel Beats, Both Seasons of\u00a0Clannad, Fairy Tail and Nadia The Secret Of Blue Water. The story has some interesting things, the characters were pretty great and, the visuals were impressive, the music is awesome and the sister arc was wonderful. It does fall short in a couple of areas though. The world building was pretty lacking, the pacing was at times was too slow for its own good and Silent Party arc of Season 2 is not that good. Despite that, I still enjoyed this show for what it worth.\\n\r\nI still like you A Certain Science\u00a0Railgun\u00a0but not as much as I use to.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 7.5/10",

Unfortunately, every one of those hopes was failed.\r\nFirst of all, the art and animation is mostly terrible. Sure some of the movement is \"slick\", but the animation is always glossy, the character art is as bad as you would expect from themanga made worse with coloring, and the awkward zooms and movement during action scenes ruins any hope of excitement. This is definitely not enjoyable to look at any time in the episodes I watched, and was cringe inducing with the bigger mistakes (like during the first episode with the first time she fires lightning, and her face practically melts).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is terrible shrill typical bad moe stuff. Not a single character sounded good, and even as someone who hates this type of fake \"cute\" voice acting I usually find that some will sound good. Furthermore, the sparkly sound effects are again cringe inducing.\\n\\n\r\nThe added details in the story so far involve more bad gags (like HRHR LOOK AT ALL MY SEXY PANTIES or THE STRIPPER LADY!!) and not much else. Yeah, some extra \"depth\" to the characters was added in like episode 6, but the additions were not interesting because the characters were not interesting. For the first couple of episodes, the extra slice of life storylines might be nice for some people, but I spent the first two episodes skipping to the action after a few exasperated minutes.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that this seems to be an already extremely typical manga made into a typical anime that was very poorly executed. The action scenes I skipped to hoping for something to salvage matters were really bland...just nothing worthwhile here as far as I can see.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "After watching both seasons of Toaru Majutsu no Index, reading all 25 light novels, and catching up to date with Index's manga, I turned to Railgun in the hopes of seeing something with a great plot and great characters - and was disappointed. \r\nAs a person who watching Toaru Kagaku no Railgun's parent story Index first, I understand that my review might be biased and compare the two a little too much. I loved Index - the story, the characters, the music - and since Mikoto was one of my favourite characters, I had high hopes of Railgun being an entertaining story full of scientificabilities - something I loved about Index. \\n\r\nUnfortunately, Railgun didn't live up to my expectations. The story line was good at some points, boring at others, and too ecchi for my liking at times. Kuroko's perverted behaviour towards Mikoto, which wasn't so obvious in Index, was blatent to the point of being disgusting at some instances. \\n\r\nThis isn't to say I don't like Railgun. I do. But as someone who adores Kazuma Kamachi's works, I find this spin off no-where near as good as Index. \\n\r\nSo, overall, I give Toaru Majutsu no Index a 10, and Railgun a 6. \\n\r\nPlease remember this is just my opinion; I am aware that there are a great many people out there who love Railgun.",

            "content": "Let me start off by getting the more controversial stuff out of the way first: This is going to piss a lot of people off, but...I honestly liked Majutsu more than Railgun. The thing I liked about the ToAruVerse was this whole dark mystery surrounding the Magic world. I honestly didn't care much for the Science side. Touma didn't nearly come across as annoying to me as he did with most people, and I just loved the priceless comedy associated with his misfortune. Whilst there was plenty to lol about in Railgun (most of the comedy coming from Kuroko), the comedy wasn't as funny tome. Not to mention that the entire main cast is female. I don't know about the rest of the guys, here, but I need a male character I can connect with. Emotional involvement with the characters is important to me, when watching an anime, and I just can\u2019t get that much from a bunch of girly-girls. Plus Railgun has a lot more 'easy going' feel of things, and I liked Majutsu's \"Dark and intense\" feel better. So in the end, Railgun was never really going to be better. Not that it wasn\u2019t much worse. I really love the ToAruVerse but I gave Majutsu a 7, because of it's many flaws and I stand by that. Railgun doesn\u2019t deserve anything less than a 7, though as well. So I guess Railgun is merely just a somewhat weaker 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe Level Upper storyline was great and all, but it only consisted of a few episodes and relied on a lot of single episodes at the beginning to set the scene. The episodes that followed afterwards weren\u2019t that great and were average at best, except for the last episode which I think ended strongly, despite some clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only two things that prevent me from giving this show a 6: Saten and Kiyama. Saten is quite easily the best character in the series for me and is definitely on my favourite character list. It\u2019s not just her warm bubbly and quirky personality. I sympathised with her easily in her struggles in the Level arc thanks to how unbelievably human she was and it produced one of the most emotional scenes I\u2019ve ever watched: her breakdown over the phone with Uiharu and Uiharu\u2019s following encouragement. And what\u2019s more was that, unlike other anime, it was followed up on, even after the Level Upper arc, showing that psychological problems can\u2019t be solved so easily with Epiphany Therapies and the like. Kiyama didn\u2019t win my heart as much as Saten but she came close. Her closure in the end was wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nThis comes as a bit of a problem now, because I suspect that if there is a second season of Railgun that follows on to the Sisters arc, we won\u2019t be seeing much of Saten nor Kiyama anymore. Nonetheless, though the science side of the ToAruVerse isn\u2019t my favourite side, it\u2019s still a side I like a lot and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how Misaka become so broken as she did in Majutsu. Kind of irritating how they didn\u2019t announce a second series for either Majutsu or Railgun, but Railgun has proved quite popular so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bound to happen. Here\u2019s hoping.\\n",

            "content": "A day at school, and an evening and afternoon after. Plus esper powers. Restaurants, shops, festivals. And esper powers. Social meetings with fellow students, window shopping at malls and boutiques, and leisurely walks through recreational and urban fare. Esper powers. All of it possible in Academy City, the technological capital, marvel, and envy of the world, where there is hardly a dull moment. All of it possible for Mikoto Misaka and her friends. All of it, and some extra baggage.\r\nA Certain Scientific Railgun is a J.C. Staff (of Shakugan no Shana, Shigofumi, and Toradora! fame) anime adaptation of a manga of the same name conceivedby manga artist Motoi Fuyukama and light novel author Kazuma Kamachi. With direction by Tatsuyuki Nagai, script by Miya Asakawa and Michiko Ito, and character designs, original and anime, by Kiyotaka Haimura and Yuichi Tanaka, respectively, we follow the adventures of Misaka, an important supporting character in the series' parent, Kamachi's A Certain Magical Index (which later became its own anime and manga), the most powerful electromaster as well as one of the strongest espers in Academy City, and her friends, Kuroko Shirai, Kazari Uiharu, and Ruiko Saten. Emphasis on her companions, being that while the show is named after Misaka's nicknames, it covers them quite a bit as well, who they are, what they're feeling, and the bonds of friendship they strike. Nevertheless, the show doesn't forget its roots, making numerous references and cameos to people and events from Index itself. Touma Kamijou, Index's main protagonist, takes the similar role as Misaka did in his series by makes his recurring rounds as support. And to be perfectly honest, I like how he's shown here rather than there, where his goofiness doesn't seem so exclusive from his solid moral stances. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is divided into one portion directly from the source, the Level Upper Arc, and anime original stuff, the Big Spider Arc, the Poltergeist Arc, and all the character specific episodes in between, to provide some breathing room for the next big arc in the manga, presumably to prevent an exhaustion of future adaptive material while leaving enough time to give the existing unadapted print some justice on screen, among other things. Particularly notable of this series is its constant use of foreshadow to create a sense of escalating tension and commitment to every character introduced. Minor, yet deliberate details, seemingly out-of-place snapshots, suspicious after-thought abnormalities, throwaway characters that don't seem all that throw away, develop to become something major in the future. Speaking of throwaways, aside for child errors, this show has few, if any. Many a side character is given a considerable degree of spotlight despite their status and are either retired properly, rather than abruptly, or go on to become relevant in future events, laying the groundwork for an overwhelming amount of potential and immersion. The backgrounds are beautiful to look at and contribute a necessary sense of scale to the world building that's evidently being sought for, but also adding a personal note, localized enough to be able to share, in sincerity and intimacy, the experiences of our main heroines. The animation is solid, funny in that exaggerated sort of way when a joke or gag is being played, and thrilling when the story calls for it. \\n\\n\r\nThe likelihood of whether or not you'll like this show will probably weigh heavily on whether or not you are able to enjoy slice of life and its slow paced nature. Railgun is both important parts this and action, the latter more saturated in Index. If you don't find slice of life in general boring, if you're dispositionally inclined in taste or open-minded enough to enjoy it, the next issue that needs to be addressed with this show before taking the next step forward to actually watching it is whether or not the everyday feel of these segments have a purpose. The more famous and infamous instances of slice of life in this medium fall under the category of \u201ccute girls doing cute things,\u201d and while it may be alright for those shows to feature such, it isn't for Railgun. It presents itself as something more. The purpose is to show characterization taking place, not tell, from how it is to how it evolves, something that sees the main cast, plus much of the supporting cast, as persons, instead of one word to one sentence stereotypes, something that Index, the anime and the character, has trouble illustrating properly. In spite of their abilities, espers are people too, with all their flaws. \\n\\n\r\nSame goes with this show's namesake Misaka, who, in addition to being the Railgun, the 3rd ranked Level 5, and yes, tsundere, is also very much a person of many facets: independent, proud, sometimes to the point of headstrong and hot-tempered, child-like in her tastes, yet fussily contrarian when she's called on it, and fiercely loyal. She has a heart of gold and lightening, but foremost, she's a girl who wants nothing more than a relatively normal life (as normal as it can get for someone with esper powers) with the people she treasures. These traits of hers slowly, but surely, are put inside a crucible and put to the flame as much as they are gradually built up as the city's darkness becomes more and more manifest. A similarly impressive level of characterization occurs with Saten, who happens to be Level 0.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the city itself, the show's setting, which is a character in and of itself, its breathtakingly advanced central core and its seedier outliers and underbellies that mirror the metropolis' own host of social successes and failures as well as science's accolades and excesses. Evident, for example, is Academy City's own brand of class discrimination and human experimentation. It's a utopia and dystopia, all in one... never a dull moment in this city, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAside for a slice of life, which is more or less you have to take or leave, the issue I have with Railgun is the disparity in the quality of the script. While it may be said that Kamachi had a hand in creating every story angle, it's evident that the writing that is \u201cdirect from source\u201d is stronger and more confident than the writing that is \u201canime original\u201d or, using a more connotationally derogatory term, \u201cfiller,\u201d often relying on the aforementioned numerous Index cameos to carry it through at times. It's always welcome, but its never a substitute for decent storytelling, though it doesn't go overboard. However, the main problem lies in the anime original plot threads rather than the episodic pieces. A lot of interesting ideas are juggled, to be sure, using the universe and previous happenings to its advantage, but the content, probably a mixture of time restraints and less talented authors, are unquestionably more straightforward and convenient in its execution and conclusions compared to the manga material, to the point not capitalizing on the potential of certain aspects of the story and overlooking others in spite of the show's diligence in keeping everything tight and focused, examples being the identity and backstory of Poltergeist arc's major antagonist and the functionality of a railgun. A railgun isn't a particle beam cannon. A particle accelerator, on the other hand, can... no, I'm getting ahead of myself.\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs \u201conly my railgun\u201d and \u201cLevel 5 -judgelight-\u201d follows Index's lead of techno inspired music, electronic embellishments and synthetics to complement the melody which, this time around, is fist-pumping awesome... I mean, upbeat, and band, this time around by J-Pop group fripSide, who made their debut and fame with this anime. The audible transitions synchronize perfectly with the animation sequences, which always seem to be bustling with activity and energy as scene after scene, flipping character, setting, and plot device, saying so much about everyone and everything shown without a need for a single word. Noteworthy in some positive ways is the musical introduction to OP1 and the scene with Misaka firing her Railgun. For the former when the noise drops for suspense and black turns to a vibrant, electric color before the music kicks into full throttle. For the latter, when it mirrors her mixture of concentration and confidence at performing her signature move. Noteworthy in a negative way is the spoiler for the villain of the final arc. \\n\\n\r\nThe EDs \u201cDear My Friend -Mada Minu Mirai He-\u201d or \u201cDear My Friend -Towards an Unseen Future-\u201d and \u201cReal Force,\u201d the latter more upbeat than the other, by one of my favorite Japanese singers, ELISA, in my opinion, an amazing singer who with an equally amazing sense of range. My only contention about her at times is that she likes a lot of Engrish in her songs, which shake me up whenever she puts it as a point for emphasis. The exception is a special insert ending song also performed by ELISA, \u201cSMILE -You & Me-\u201d re-purposes ED1's melody while replacing the original lyrics entirely with English while discarding all the extra background music for a soul crushing classic guitar, soul suspending cello, and soul sublimating keyboard accompaniment with an equally impressive vocal. Never mind the heavy Japanese accent (the words are still pretty comprehensible by ear regardless), this level of elegant, yet evocative expression is exactly why I'm such a fan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you don't mind watching girls living their lives while being badass to the side, then by all means, watch it. There's that aspect, the wonderfully thorough characterization, Academy City, and whole lot more to conceivably enjoy. And while it helps, as it does its best to come off as its own tale (the cameos, save Kamijou, are mostly just cameos, a superficial bit of appreciation for people in the know) you don't need to watch Index to understand the substantial bits of it. It just adds some extra world building, scale, immersion... what have you.\\n\\n\r\nI give A Certain Scientific Railgun an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "This will be my first review here, so beforehand I\u2019m sorry for my bad English, incompetence and stuff.\r\nOnce upon a time I was looking for some Shana-like sci-fi action and this is how I got my hands on Toaru Majutsu no Index. It has cool setting so I like that show. Then Toaru Kagaku no Railgun came which I was looking forward to. Indeed, the same setting, more Misaka and no Index, who I think was annoying sometimes; so yeah, that\u2019d be great series, it seemed.\r\nNow I can tell you what, Railgun\u2019s not great. Well, it\u2019s not bad either, it\u2019s pretty much average show aboutmagi\u2026 I mean, esper girls. So does it deserve watching? If you have free time, then yes, because Railgun is one of the best average shows I ever saw.\\n\\n\r\nThe good art, catchy opening themes and the whole conception of the series are the strongest points here. Characters\u2026 well, they\u2019re a bit stereotypical with moe elements and a bit of yuri fanservice but basically that is not bad (there\u2019s Misaka, guys) plus we have nice character development throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo why is it not great? The first point is that the plot progresses really slow. It\u2019s viscous like nougat. In one episode you can see a lot of action with some epic battles, which drives you excited, but then you get three episodes of some random back stories, centred on a side characters and stuff. It\u2019s pretty rough and enjoyment level shakes like sinusoid, so I think this anime would be better if it was in 12 series format.\\n\\n\r\nThe second point is a subjective thing, so it can mean nothing to you. Well, y\u2019know, I\u2019m one of those people, who think that Railgun lacks Kamij\u014d for tsundere Misaka. Yeah. I\u2019m not too fond of harem anime but for me it seems that Railgun needs some kind of male lead or something. That\u2019s why I like Toaru Majutsu no Index more and that\u2019s why the moments when Kamij\u014d appears on screen were one of the most awesome parts here.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I really enjoyed this anime but I think that it\u2019d be better if JC Staff released more Shakugan no Shana or Majutsu no Index instead of Railgun. Am I right or not, it\u2019s for you, guys, to judge, so you can always watch the series and decide yourselves.\\n\\n\r\nI rate this four points for visual and sound parts, plus two points for setting and plot, and plus one more for Pika-chan\u2026 I mean, Misaka. So seven points out of ten in total. That\u2019s it.",

            "content": "Railgun is one of those rare shows that I'm willing to rate on just enjoyment alone. That's not to say things like story and characters aren't important, but Railgun doesn't particularly win you over with any of those. This is popcorn fare through and through, but the characters are so likable and the effort is showing at every turn, that even I can't turn my nose up to Misaka and her merry friends.\r\nThis is saying a lot because for the most part, I can turn my nose up to Index if I want to. It certainly wasn't a bad show, but as I said inmy review of it, it was disposable eye candy. Nothing particularly memorable. For the most part, Railgun would have been the same if it hadn't made up where Index failed.\\n\\n\r\nThe character interactions alone make this series worth the watch. I love a good \"four girls doing nothing\" anime when the four girls all have their own different ways of interacting with each other and when none of the girls are stereotypical archetypes. Even though Kuroko is batshit lesbo for Misaka, that's only one side of her personality and we see many different forms of interaction with the other girls. With Uiharu, she plays a capable mentor to her lack of confidence, and so long as she's not around Misaka, she's as normal as any of the other girls. Likewise, Misaka goes totally tsundere when Touma makes a cameo, but she is not ruled by her tsundere qualities. She has a strong sense of justice that makes her narrow-minded in certain situations, and she keeps a lot of her personal preferences guarded from the others. As a \"four girls doing nothing\" series, it works, but it doesn't stop there.\\n\\n\r\nOnce in a while, Railgun decides it wants to have a plot, and when it does, it goes into it heart and soul. This is even more fascinating because the final stretch is 100% filler and yet it brings all the character growth and final revelations to the table that one expects from a solid conclusion. If no one had told me I was watching filler, I would have believed this was canon material. It is just that good, so good that in fact I'd say it makes up for the consecutive standalone fanservice filler that preceded it.\\n\\n\r\nThe technical qualities are still as good as Index, with the voice acting being even better. The voices were unique and done well enough that they felt like genuine performances and not just throwaway roles, especially Uiharu's from Aki Toyosaki, a seiyuu who I am genuinely starting to warm up to despite a rocky introduction to her work. But I digress.\\n\\n\r\nRailgun isn't the best anime. It doesn't have the best anything for that matter, but it does have a lot of heart. It cares about seeing the relationships of the four girls grow. It cares about having a plot that's always there, though not always the focus, and tying up all the loose ends rather than saying \"LOL WAIT FOR SEASON 2\" at the end. But above all, it asks for nothing more than to be enjoyed and it does so without excessive pandering. Given how much anime is tailor-made these days to certain fetishes and archetypes, that is nothing short of wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give To Aru Kagaku no Railgun an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "This anime's name is tremendously long, therefore I'm gonna refer to it as 'railgun' from now on.\r\nHaving watched To aru majutsu no index and enjoyed it, I went into this with relatively high expectations, especially considering how likeable Mikoto is in Index. \r\nUnfortunately, like that neighbour who you always thought was a nice person but who'd actually been poisoning your plants these last few years and leaving dog shit on your doorstep, Mikoto is not all she seems, or perhaps she was in index and they just wanted to create a character who could out-self righteous the main character from index (to the point thatit would make the characters from freezing seem open minded) in the spin off.\\n\r\nWhatever you want to believe one thing is for sure. Mikoto is not a likeable character in railgun. But we'll get to that in the character segment.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this show is arc based, like Index, with an overarching plot that revolves around a teacher/scientist with a chronic condition that causes her to get the impulse to strip suddenly without warning and usually in public (whom I will henceforth refer to as stripper teach) and her quest to save the kids she unwittingly sold to a doctor death type scientist who enjoys human experiments that go bad simply because it gets him up in  the morning... OK maybe that last one was a bit exaggerated but it is essentially the gist of the problem.\\n\\n\r\nLike in index, those rascally scientists are still trying to create the elusive lvl 6 super esper and like in index they've taken a less than moral approach to it and it's up to Mikoto and her chums to save the day and stop the bad guys. \\n\\n\r\nnow don't get me wrong, I'm quite fond of science tbh and I'm also in favour of a little morality in science and thus I enjoy a show which prizes itself on highlighting the dangers of abusing science for your own gain. And while this show is just such a thing, it does it incredibly badly.\\n\\n\r\nThe level of immorality in the science in this show is just damn awful and unbelievable, and considering how strict and highly regulated this city is they sure get away with a tremendous amount of mass murder. But perhaps we should address the regulators in this city.\\n\\n\r\nthe police force are divided into two groups, the SWAT like group and the main investigation and minor arrest group called judgement, the latter of which is almost entirely run by....kids. Whose great idea was that. And it just so happens that Mikoto's sexually frustrated lesbian friend Kuroko (whose suicidally unrestrained lust for Mikoto is only marginally shown in index) just happens to be a member. With kids running intelligence no wonder the cities full of lunatic eugenicists.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, whil;e index had a ridiculous plot of it's own this show outdoes itself to the point where it becomes an \"are you kidding me\"  kind of series. but never the less it'll get your emotions boiling which is to its credit, however most of your anger and outrage will be directed at how poorly this city is run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in the show much like in index is superb and very modern without adding the obvious 3D effects in. It's highly polished and fluidic so it is a sight to behold, the battles between Mikoto and her enemies are quite breathtaking but I feel that the animators didn't experiment enough with her ability and end up making it seem somewhat underwhelming at times.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects where pretty good and the crackling sound of Mikoto's lightening is visceral and realistic. The music is modern and has that electronic rock sort of feel however while the main theme is good and works as a finisher song for when Mikoto finally decides to do what she could have done at the beginning of the fight to finish them off, the rest of the music is barely noticeable and relatively uninteresting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nNow to get back to my panning of Mikoto as a character. She was likeable in index because she had that Yankee quality to her mixed in with a cute personality that sort of came through beneath the surface which coupled with her insecurity about her tastes (many of which indicated her childish character) made her seem genuine and cute, but once you drag her character into the main heroine chair she quickly cuts the appeal away. As a side character whose childish attitude conflicts nicely with Touma's realist and defeatist attitude but as a main character her childishness just makes her irritating.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially when she's spouting her self righteous, \"quite complaining about being weak and try to become strong\" speech...sheesh, she sounds just like another group of people I've heard about, hmm, who where they?, oh yeah it's the republican party in America who always like to say \"why don't quit complaining about being poor and just work harder\", I digress, but you can see the similarities and I'm not entirely convinced that her character wasn't created to draw attention to this problem with governments around the world, since she's just as hypocritical.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the anime we get a glimpse of how Mikoto's path toward god-like power began with a scientist helping her raise her power to the max when she was a kid because her power could save lives....uh huh...right. So basically she talks about working hard, but like the republicans she was given the advantage over everyone else, in this case, help from an expert to get where she needed to be. Never the less she tries to tell people off for saying they can't do things cause their lvl 0 that with her power she finds easy (usually fighting more powerful opponents). \\n\\n\r\nBasically Mikoto is naive to a stupendous degree, since she believes that people without power shouldn't complain and work harder despite living in a city where having esper powers is everything and if you have none to speak of you're basically cast aside as useless cannon fodder for the various people who abuse that power. (only about half way through the show do they actually start helping these people develop their abilities, or develop abilities period) and Mikoto tends to come save these people by using her electric power to kick the bully's ass then turns around and basically says see how easy it was for me you should be able to do the same....see how unlike-able she is?\\n\\n\r\nThat's basically like a tiger going up to a dog that's half dead because he picked a fight with a lion and saying \"I could have taken that lion on easy, you're pathetic\" despite the fact that the dog is small and at a greater disadvantage. Again I digress, needless to say during the anime Mikoto's fantasy world where everyone can become powerful if they work hard is usually shown to be complete nonsense regularly and she tends to constantly make naive and stupid decisions despite the clear and obvious answer (refer to the last arc, where she has to choose between stripper teach and crazy ponytail chick with a chip on her shoulder.\\n\\n\r\nMikoto has power but no responsibility, and do you think she learns from her mistake? sorta, but not really. She makes the same damn mistakes over and over again like a rat that still hasn't figured out that the left button gives a shock but not the cheese, and every time she makes a mistake that puts other people in jeopardy she never pays for her mistakes and in fact the very fact she was the one who put them in that position because of her stupidity is never addressed by any of the other characters and they act like it never happened, no one goes up to her at the end and tells her that it's her fault and she should live with the consequences of what happened or could have happened, therefore she doesn't have to feel the weight or guilt of her mistakes and so she doesn't really learn form them. In reality, she would have been slapped and told that she's too stupid to be trusted with big decisions and she tends to always make the big decisions because she's powerful and hat gives her opinions precedence and she does use that power to force her opinions on others. Yet she's fighting the guys abusing their power,  how ironic. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the other characters Kuroko's depravity and obsession with Mikoto was so understated in index, in this show she's essentially a rapist exhibitionist who gladly drops the soap if you catch my drift, she is so disturbingly debauched in this anime that I couldn't believe my eyes, and her character is so all over the place, one minute she's serious and strict the next minute she's salivating at the mouth and man handling Mikoto despite the fact she gets shocked almost every time (seems Mikoto isn't the only rat looking for the illusive cheese that never seems to come from pressing the left button) her level of debauchery and tantamount rape make her equally unlikeable and ultimately disturbing. as for the other two Saten and Uiharu their characters are so weak and overshadowed by the insane and over the top behaviour of Kuroko and your anger at Mikoto that they just seem pretty negligible and only seem to be there to balance the power tables of the group since they have practically no power what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhether you can enjoy this anime or not is dependant on how much you like the fight scenes really since their pretty awesome, but the characters just tend to irritate you or in the case of Kuroko disturb you, so it's a matter of preference, and honestly there are only two likeable characters in this show, stripper teach since she seems to be the only character with a decent attitude to the world she lives in, no fairy tale outlooks, no preaching about how she's better than you, and she seems to be the only character that's really had any development in this series, and accelerator since he doesn't take crap from anyone and seems to be somewhat responsible with his power by comparison, (using it to keep everyone from disturbing him rather than using it to get an edge in life).\\n\\n\\n\r\noverall I've ranted quite a bit, but meh, this show isn't as good as index by a mile but there's certainly some enjoyment you can get out of it. \\n",

            "content": "If ever there was a word in visual media that the general public immediately distrusted, it's \"spinoff\". Experience has proven to many that a show, comic or novel that is derivative of a popular series is rarely as good as the original work, and the DVD bargain basement is littered with titles that were designed with one thing in mind - to cash in on the original work's popularity due to the lack of a valid sequel. Shows like Crusade (Babylon 5), Joey (Friends), Highlander: The TV series, Robocop: The TV series, the horrendous Baywatch titles, and a horde of others all attempted to milkextra profits from a cow that had gone dry.\\n\\n\r\nAll is not lost though, as while it is rare that a spinoff can proclaim itself  to be as good as, if not better than, the original work, there are some shows that do fit the bill. Frasier (Cheers), CSI: NY and Miami, Torchwood (Dr. Who), Mork & Mindy (Happy Days), and a small number of other titles are widely regarded as at least equal to the original works.\\n\\n\r\nToaru Kagaku no Railgun can also add its name to that list..\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Toaru Majutsu no Index this series is not actually based on the light novels by Kamachi Kazuma, but is instead based on a spinoff manga by Fuyukawa Motoi. Unlike the Index series the spinoff focuses on Misaka Mikoto, the \"Railgun\" from the original series. Once more the action takes place in Academy City as Mikoto and her friends are beset by strange earthquakes, conspiracies, friendship issues, and all manner of hijinks.\\n\\n\r\nLike the original series the format of Railgun uses an amalgamation of episodic and multi-chapter arcs however, much like Index, the series is also flawed in terms of its plot because of this. While the series has a reasonably enjoyable story, the tendency to jump from one focus to another like frog on a hot rock is detrimental to the flow of the plot. It's unfortunate as the format is similar to that adopted by GitS: SAC, however the big difference between the two shows is that where GitS: SAC provided food for thought, Railgun neglects this in favour of audience pleasing fillers (if the audience is juvenile that is). \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the plot has some interesting aspects to it, however the lack of a timeframe means that viewers may become a tad confused as to the ordering of events, especially if one tries to correlate the occurences in Index with those in Railgun.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest downside to the format of Railgun though, is the fact that the more interesting aspects of the show are never fully explored due to the lack of focus, something which would have given this show the edge that it really needs.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot may have its issues, the art and animation for Railgun is definitely a step up from Index. The characters follow the design of the manga and the original series, and while this may promote a certain sense of continuity, it's also a downside as well, as the character design becomes a little stale over the course of the show (i.e. too much of the same).\\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds and settings are generally bright and colourful, and the scenery is very much in keeping with the style of the original series. The animation is generally smooth, however there are moments when the characters move in a truly ludicrous manner, something which can ruin a good action scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I do question is the fanservice, as it's clearly surplus to requirements. Granted the series is nowhere near the same level as some I could mention, however this is a showthat didn't really need to go that extra mile just to please the fans, and the story would have been more enjoyable without all the pandering.\\n\\n\r\nRailgun is generally well served in the acting department. Satou Rina and Arai Satomi reprise their roles from Index as Mikoto and Kuroko, and they are joined by Itou Kanae and Toyosaki Aki (Saten Ruiko and Uiharu Kazari respectively), to form the main core of characters. However, while the actresses are all experienced, there are occasions when the roles are really \"hammed up\", particularly when it comes to relationship issues.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, the show has a decent variety of thematic tracks which are generally well used when required, however there are also occasions where the music is clearly at odds with the on screen action. The generally upbeat style of music is reflected in the two OPs and two of the EDs used in the series. The ED for episode 12 is more melodic and has a slightly bittersweet sentiment to it which serves as a nice counterpoint to the ending of that particular arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest surprise of this series is the characters. In a strange irony, they are both the best aspect of Railgun, but also its worst. The lack of plot focus is, in part, made up for by the development of the main cast, especially Ruiko who, in terms of actual character growth, is developed more than the other three girls. Now many fans may argue with that perspective, however I will point out that of the four main girls, it's Ruiko who not only changes the most, but also endures the most.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I did mention that the characters were also the worst part of Railgun didn't I? Well, the reason for this is that while the characters do receive a degree of development, it simply isn't enough to justify their actions. The lack of plot focus only exacerbates the problem, and the show is littered with semi developed characters. In addition to this, the usage of comic relief based fanservice (e.g. Kuroko's behaviour towards Mikoto), washes away what little development had gone before. While the characters are engaging enough in their own way, the show could have done with putting more effort into the plot and characters, and less into making money from the hormone crazed masses.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of the problems I've mentioned, many might think that I didin't enjoy Railgun, when in actuality, I did. The show is entertaining as a no brain action romp, and had the potential, along with Index, to be something truly great. While I may regard Railgun as a wasted opportunity, it isn't actually a bad show at all, and many people may find something to keep them insterested. \\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty though, Railgun, like Index, had a great deal more potential than it actually delivers. The concept of both series is inventive and imaginative, however the execution, especially in Railgun, falls flat due to the desire to make money.The biggest example of how this impacts the show is the level of fanservice throughout the series (one whole episode, for example, is nothing more than a swimsuit buffet). It rapidly becomes obvious that the one of the main purposes of this series is to pander to hordes who love Mikoto, and while giving the public what they want isn't a bad thing, sometimes a show is better off not doing so.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side though, at least Toaru Kagaku no Railgun is one of the few spinoffs that's as good as the original story.",

If our limitations only exist so we can surpass them, should there be a limit to how far we can go to get there?\r\nToaru Kagaku no Railgun, or A Certain Scientific Railgun, follows the events around Misaka Mikotoand her core group of friends and their exploits within the City. They are students, aiming to better their powers as espers. But in a city with a concentrated amount of people with special abilities, it\u2019s only natural for the criminally-minded to try to carve out their own bit of power at the expense of others. To combat such an element and maintain civil order, the organization Judgment exists.

Her ability to generate and manipulate electricity makes her a force that most overconfident thugs learn too late shouldn\u2019t have been reckoned with. Kuroko is her best friend, a crazy and hyperactive girl whose yuri-obsession with her beloved \u201cOnee-sama\u201d is hilarious despite constant rejection. Teleportation of objects (herself included) is her esper proficiency, making her one of the more menacing opponents to come up against, despite the diminutive and cute appearance. Uiharu is the demure techie: easily embarrassed, but a wizard at hacking or culling information from any network. As a member of Judgment, she is often the \u201ceye-in-the-sky\u201d for Kuroko when they take action.\\n\\n\r\nIn a place brimming with espers, Saten is the most fascinating of the four. Her official designation is Level 0. She has no powers at all. Nevertheless, she attends classes and learns all there is to learn about being an esper. The teachers explain to the Level 0s like her that it\u2019s possible to reach Level 1\u2026 but Saten always has a wistful look when the topic comes up. It\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t have that kind of optimism. What does it mean to be that kind of outsider looking in? And how much worse is it to be in the middle of this incredible city, surrounded by so many exceptional people she\u2019d love to be?\\n\\n\r\nAcademy City is almost a character in itself. It\u2019s hard not to fall in love with it. Clean, stylish, dotted with wind generators, a near-futuristic center of learning and advanced scientific research, all the while supersaturated with technology. The juxtaposition of seemingly sentient trash-collector robots and soda machines that only work if you kick them appears to point out that we\u2019ll always have some low-tech around.\\n\\n\r\nRailgun fixes most every glaring problem that tripped up Toaru Majutsu no Index. Gone are Index\u2019s occasional -- albeit entirely useless -- scenes where those involved in the higher echelons of running Academy City were up to some sinister, boring machinations.  Fortunately, Railgun is much more down-to-earth. It also wisely limits the amount of talking that occurs during fight sequences. The action is left to unfold naturally, instead of cramming in reams of idealistic soliloquies that the Index villains probably weren\u2019t even listening to. Finally, it does away with Index\u2019s tendency to tell one mini-arc, followed by another mini-arc, followed by another mini-arc\u2026 ad nauseam that tended to make the show\u2019s overall narrative out of focus and its pace too breakneck.\\n\\n\r\nThe structure of this show, however, is a bit of an odd thing and does deserve to be mulled over. It begins largely episodic with only a scattering of episodes focused entirely on the more serious arc that concludes at the halfway point. The second half is much the same. I say \u2018odd\u2019 because it\u2019s a unique structure I\u2019ve rarely come across. Most non-episodic anime tend to follow the same format as any other narrative medium: an identifiable conflict or targeted goal at the outset; gradual complications along the way; an ending with the inevitable climax and resolution.\\n\\n\r\nRailgun mostly ignores that age-old wisdom. Twice. \\n\\n\r\nThe four or five episodes that precede each climax are strong, focused, and exciting. So if the creators were so capable, why not follow the arcs in every episode? Simply put, it seems to be a stylistic choice -- and one that is as refreshing as it is surprisingly effective. It frees up the story, allows our perspective of Academy City to expand by degrees and the characters a chance to breathe. The importance of the latter cannot be stressed enough. After all, our heroines are living here primarily to learn. It\u2019s a given that attending classes and socializing are going to make up no small portion of their day-to-day lives.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Kuroko and Uiharu\u2019s work at Judgment comprises the larger portion. Most of the fun is watching them work on cases and hunt down perpetrators. Even though Misaka isn\u2019t a part of Judgment, she often forces herself into the role of unofficial member. That she has this proclivity for beating up criminals isn\u2019t so much that she\u2019s a do-gooder, but rather that\u2019s how she finds it easiest to protect her friends. She has an active investment in their well-being and specific meaningful relationships to lose if something goes wrong. This is, of course, all to say that it\u2019s vastly more engaging to watch her and her cohorts, as opposed to a certain bed-headed, misfortunate guy with a chronic Helper Monkey Complex.\\n\\n\r\nI usually don\u2019t mention voice acting, but the consistent excellence is such that I can\u2019t avoid it. Toyosaki Aki easily hits her highest note yet here and in one pivotal moment gives an amazing, touching performance. Even the always-talented Tanaka Atsuko creates a character that is very special. So to avoid a laundry list of names, let me simply say that if some of your favorite seiyuu are involved, it probably wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to urge you to check it out for that reason alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs are as highly-charged as Misaka\u2019s railgun and the EDs are catchy outros after all the excitement. In fact, the songs that bookend the show\u2019s second half are as good as -- if not better than -- the first half\u2019s. And here I thought it was some sort of sadistic tradition in anime for second-half OPs and EDs to be lacklustre. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall soundtrack is just as fantastic. Not only the music itself, but also its skillful use. At one point, a solitary piano begins playing, making us realize that since the episode started there hasn\u2019t been any music. Instead of merely reinforcing the mood, it becomes the subtext that the characters can\u2019t say. Later on when they connect to each other, a similar piano begins. As they are finally able to talk, more and more instruments are woven into the song as they become more and more desperate to express everything they wanted to say earlier.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects are another design element that truly shine. There is something so perfect in the execution of Biribiri\u2019s electricity and Kuroko\u2019s teleportation. It isn\u2019t that Index\u2019s sound effects for these abilities were bad at all, but rather that in Railgun they have been refined enough to be a little addicting to listen to. Likewise, the action of the fight scenes is as much aural as it is visual. Impact is visceral, whether against concrete or someone\u2019s face.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is crisp and beautiful. The visual design is such that your eyes get drawn in, from a particularly huge parfait to some spellbinding fight choreography. Some close-up expressions of the characters are priceless. Unfortunately, certain distance shots of them can dip in quality. It\u2019s a pity given the polished look of everything else around them, but comparatively speaking it\u2019s easy to forgive as it doesn\u2019t occur often.\\n\\n\r\nRailgun is an anime that starts with a cast of memorable characters, tells a very entertaining story, and has the privilege of doing so with laudable production values. The questions it raises are thought-provoking and relevant. Even when the story meanders into a stand-alone episode that has no real bearing on the plot, it is always with a sense of how it fits into the overarching frame. Like its characters, the story breathes. At times it runs; at times it walks. And yes, also like its characters, sometimes it takes that random detour and ends up discovering something wholly unexpected. While science plays a large role in the show, all its elements end up filled with quite a bit of magic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s a certain kind of awesome.",

            "content": "To Aru Kagaku no Railgun is a show that I was pretty hyped to start watching after ending Majutsu no Index, as I thought it would be cool to get some insight on Misaka's life as a Level 5 and get to know better the world the esper's live in. What I got was nothing like that, at all.\r\nThe story is nothing new. At all. There are people who can use powers and this time a whole city is there to develop these. Even though everyone's already full of that premise, doesn't mean you don't have to explain the world build, writers. We only gota glance at what its like living in Academy City. The world was never explained. Why the magic users don't appear was never explained. The \"Level\" system was never fully explained. We saw everything but knew nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThis show uses a specific formula to get its story arcs going, usually introducing a new character that has nothing to do with the conflict at the start, and then starts slowly revealing why this one character in fact has everything to do with the conflict. The wrong in the execution of the show is its constant failures to try to hide it. The episode itself tries to be too unpredictable and almost becomes too predictable, you see. It\u2019s funny how this show tries to pretend it\u2019s not based on arcs by constantly remembering you of what happened in the past. These \u2018flashbacks\u2019 are unneeded and they only serve to take more screentime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story contains many trivial episodes (which is also a screentime problem, like the festival, the visit to the girls dorm, the Judgement investigation episodes of things we already know about etc.) and recycles alot of jokes (like Shirai worshipping Misaka). Not only that, but the filler episodes and the jokes are misplaced, which completely ruins the dramatic mood it tries to develop (just like it happened in the end of episode 22).\\n\\n\r\nThe story ends up having too many mishaps and too little reconnaissances. There are twists and turns on the story but it is never truly developed since the end of every conflict has little impact on the characters themselves (like it was all 'just another adventure'). There was never a climax. There was never a point where I was worried any of the characters would get hurt. There was never an experience that involved the viewers worrying or even caring for the characters. I just accepted eveything that happened and moved on, knowing that in the end everything would go well. And it did. That's why I didn't enjoy watching this series.\\n\\n\r\nWe got more development to the side characters than to the main cast of girls, while Uiharu was the most developed and by far the worst character of the show. We still know nothing about Misaka's past, which is a shame since she has the most screentime of the entire series, and it feels dull to watch her kicking ass without knowing the conflicts she had to pass to obtain such power. The villains are are absolutely horrible. This is another anime that explains the bad guy's actions by the insanity of their minds, like a human can only be mean if they are out of it. It's cringe-worthy, I'm telling ya.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing special. I've seen this style many times, and I don't like the side faces. This is not a judging point, though, I'm just pointing it out, alright?\\n\r\nAnimation is okay. Nothing much to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound work is bad. While the fights are going the same singing tune keeps on repeating undefinitely until it's over. The episodes always start with the same calm soundtrack. Each part always has its own music. This show is so preditable that you can even predict which soundtrack is going to play for each scene, and It's not like they are good at all. The music should help the show by adding another feel to the scenes, and not help you to know what's coming up next, lmao.\\n\\n\r\nThere are shows with no story that can be enjoyable with good characters. There are shows with bad characters that can be enjoyable with a good story.\\n\r\nBut there are no shows with bad stories and bad characters that can be enjoyable. See you in the sequel, Kagaku no Railgun. I hope you learn.\\n",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nYou know, I'm always down for an average anime series. Yes, I admit I have high standards, very few anime even reach an 8 out of 10 for me, but I have absolutely no problem sitting down and watching a show I have every inclination will be just \"kind of alright\". It makes me feel like I get a bigger scope of things in the anime world when I watch these shows, so that includes watching those anime that have made it onto my Plan to Watch list for the sole purpose that for some reason, they have been able toremain relatively in the public's eye even years after they have aired. And yeah, for shows I have watched this way, anime like Guilty Crown, Mirai Nikki and Shakugan no Shana, I get exactly what I expect, from mediocre, to trying-too-hard-to-be-dark, to crap. However, every once and awhile, an anime is able to transcend the image the consensus of the anime community and myself have painted for it, and it always makes for a nice surprise. Now let me stress this, the anime I will be reviewing today, A Certain Scientific Railgun(which will just be called \"Railgun\" from now on for convenience's sake) is absolutely not like that. In this review, I'll tell you exactly how this anime fulfilled every average expectation I had for it, but somewhere along the way, planted the roots for something greater than itself.\\n\\n\r\n   Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, I've been mentally preparing myself for my return to school tomorrow, and after over a month of waiting, it's time for a new anime review. Sorry about that, but these things take awhile to write, and I've sort of spent all my time recently catching up on a lot of things, both with anime and academically. Anyway, it's time to get started, so let's start already.\\n\\n\r\nBefore that though, let's get some potential confusion out of the way first, and talk some technical shenanigan stuff. Now, A Certain Scientific Railgun acts as a spin-off to another anime: A Certain Magical Index and its sequel: A Certain Magical Index II, so for those of you who have seen both shows, keep that in mind that I have yet to see Index or its sequel, so that might be why I don't mention certain things about the franchise or its laws. And if you think that in any way impairs my ability to review Railgun, let me remind you that even if a show is a spin-off, it should still be able to stand up on its own and establish the rules of its universe without any prior knowledge of the sister/father/first series. Additionally, A Certain Scientific Railgun also has a sequel, A Certain Scientific Railgun S, and while I have seen that series(and think it is in every way better), the review today will be exclusively on the first season, though I may reference Railgun S occasionally, probably in the context of saying what it does better than the first season. OK, everyone clear? Good.\\n\\n\r\n  A Certain Scientific Railgun was brought to us by those folks over at J.C Staff, the animation studio that has brought us, as well as the entirety of the Index franchise, Toradora, Golden Time, Shakugan no Shana, and Zero no Tsukaima. It was directed by the one and only Tatsuyuki Nagai, who you probably recognize from his directorial work on both Anohana and Ano Natsu de Matteru, though I personally like him best for directing Toradora, which is still probably one of the strongest slice-of-life/romance I have seen yet. Part of the script was handled Michiko Itou, who had done work on No. 6 and a Toradora OVA, but the script was primarily handled by Miya Asakawa... who hasn't really done anything of note besides a couple episodes of Noein, which I'll be shocked if you've even heard of that(though on a side note, go watch Noein, it's pretty cool). And finally, A Certain Scientific Railgun is 24 episodes long, and aired in the season of Fall 2009, a season which also gave us Kimi ni Todoke and Aoi Bungaku, if that means anything to you. Ok, let's get started with the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAcademy City is a scientifically advanced hub of technology and the arts, apparently about 20 to 30 years ahead of the rest of the world. 80% of the population are actually students, which sounds like someone screwed up somewhere, but in addition to being pretty much the Metropolis of this world, Academy City serves a second purpose. In this world, part of humanity has awakened to a greater psychic power, which is not nearly as exciting as it sounds because the anime doesn't really go for something like Shinsekai yori in which these powers would kind of destroy the world because everyone simultaneously decided they were God now, but more something like a \"what if?\" scenario, as life is basically normal in Academy City besides from the fact that certain people could potentially fire kinetic beams from their hands. These psychic powers are different for each person and could range from teleportation, to being able to see through walls, to just having cats slightly more prone to chase you. These powers are ranged from levels 1-5 based on their power, with a level 0 simply being a normal person without any abilities. Academy City seeks to train the thousands of students to properly develop their powers(people with psychic powers have been deemed:  \"espers\") and understand them, thus why Academy City's population is so unbalanced.\\n\\n\r\nOur main heroine is Mikoto Misaka, a student of Tokiwadai Middle School, and one of only seven Level 5 espers in the entire city, her esper power being an \"Electromaster\", or in simple terms, being able to manipulate or produce vast amounts of electricity. She has earned the nickname \"Railgun\", probably because of her tendency to flick a coin into the air, and launch it with a controlled beam of electricity that is usually capable of settling whatever problem she may have.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot revolves around the daily adventures of Misaka, her roommate Kuroko Shirai, and their friends Ruiko Saten, a level 0, and Kazari Uiharu who attend a different school. As they proceed with their daily lives,  they will begin to uncover a conspiracy about the true purpose of Academy City, and at the same time, stop the ever growing numbers of enemies and factors that seemingly never rest from trying to destroy it. That's a plot I can get behind for the most part, as the story divides its time between several arcs that are usually about some trouble starting to brew in the city, from a gang of esper delinquents or mysterious cases of bombing around the city, and filler that mostly exists to get supporting characters slightly more involved in the narrative and get some breathing room in between the arcs. As I said, this is something I can definitely enjoy, especially when I want to see what crazy esper powers enemies have and how the world can be expanded from the premise, but Railgun, bless its heart, as it frequently switches from filler to plot, forgets to put anything really substantial in either.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem is the show's own writing, in the fact that it just isn't very good. So, I watched dub admittedly, but even if maybe some dialouge is switched around, the story will still follow the same basic structure right? Yes, it will, and the stories Railgun provides for the most part aren't great. You can usually predict how most arcs will end, and usually the arcs themselves are very basic in the way they progress and are structured. It doesn't help there's always at least one piece of dialouge that's worthy of a groan every episode, and no really tension exists since Railgun is undoubtedly not trying to be an overly-dark or serious show. Sure, it has its moments, but for the most part, you can practically guarantee that everything will work out in the end, all the characters will get out unscathed, and even in the darkest hour, the power of friendship will prevail. It's a shame too, because considering the promising premise, some good writing really would've shined here, as seen in A Certain Scientific Railgun S. The filler is pretty bad too, there's really not a lot there, mostly cliches without much character development, and considering how much filler there is in the series, about half of the episodes, it begins to become a problem really fast. And I'm not saying that there is an inherit problem with filler per say, but what I do have problems with is filler that doesn't accomplish anything. Look, I know it is called \"filler\" after all, but I still think that down-time of a story should be dedicated the developing characters or parts of the world that the main plot doesn't have time for. I mean, consider an anime like Bakemonogatari, an anime that practically is 90% filler, but uses nearly all of that time to develop its amazing characters, so when something sort of resembling a plot does kick in, there's all the more reason to care. \\n\\n\r\n  It's not all bad however. I usually have a problem with anime with an arc format with filler in between, because as seen in the original Fate/stay night, the tonal identity of the anime suffers, as it switches too far often between light-hearted filler and plot. Railgun, on the other hand, is able to keep a consistent tone throughout, and whether the characters are having a beach episode, or the plot dips into something actually quite dark, it never feels unjustified. Also, the pacing and structure is actually quite exceptional. Yes, I'm still complaining about the basic structure of any given arc, but the structure of the entire shows fits together quite well. And if we were to continue this extended structure metaphor, the parts of the story all fit together to form a complete picture. There's definitely a sense of escalation in the plot, and every arc plays at least a little bit of a part in the bigger picture. This means by the time we reach the finale, and Misaka is fighting mech suits on a highway, it's easy to see how we got here from the beach episode, which is definitely a positive. However, if I were to pick the high point of the entire series, I still think the mid-season finale was kind of awesome, in both execution and the fact that a lot of things were going down and I thought it was cool. \\n\\n\r\n     It's still not great, the main plot that is, but I'd say it is passable but nothing special. Whatever plot-points or themes the plot does bring up for the most part have been done better in some other anime, and while that's not necessarily a deal-breaker, it's a problem. I do like the plot, and it's probably the best part of this otherwise average show, but I find it hard to give it too much credit. \\n\\n\r\nWe're moving onto characters now, and I will say I really like our main character Mikoto Misaka, because she is pretty awesome. The problem is, I can't tell you why. A Certain Scientific Railgun mostly just establishes her character while Railgun S develops her in all kind of awesome ways, so saying why I like her character might spoil some things I would prefer you weren't spoiled about. So, I'll just give you her surface personality. Misaka, despite being one of the strongest espers in Academy City, isn't arrogant about it, though that isn't too say she doesn't know just how powerful she is in comparison to other espers. She's a little hot-headed, which is good in the way that she will try to end a battle as quickly and effectively as possible by using her superior power to protect her friends. However, it's bad in the way that she's quick to anger, and usually tries to solve every problem by firing a electricity beam at it. It is in this way that her fights between enemies becomes a little more even, so she doesn't seem overpowered in the story compared to others, at least usually. She's also one who tries to accomplish everything herself, and even gets into dangerous situations when there's really no need to, though that might be just an excuse for the anime so it can get an arc initiated. As I said, most of her development is saved for Railgun S, but looking at her character from the first season exclusively, I'd say she stands out fairly on her own, and feels a little different from most main protagonists, which I'm grateful for. \\n\r\n     As for Misika's roommate Kuroko(and the rest of the cast actually), she doesn't hold up as well. Besides from her personality trait of constantly perving after Misaka, there's not a whole lot to her. She's a member of Judgement, a sort of student run police force, which allows her to show off her more serious side. It is also through Judgement that allows Misaka and the rest of the cast to get involved in the plot, as they help Kuroko and Judgement stop whatever thing is terrorizing the city. The only thing I'll give Kuroko, besides that she is kind of annoying, is that she is undoubtedly the person who knows Misaka the best, and is usually the first to scold Misaka at her tendency to rush into situations without thinking. \\n\r\n     The problem I have with Saten is that she is kind of useless. At first, I thought her role would be to be, despite not having any esper powers, the voice of reason and intelligence. But she's not really that either. She's just kind of... yeah useless. And as for her friend Uiharu, I don't really have much to say about her either. And that is a big flaw when nearly all of your main cast is sort of under-developed, and a big reason why you'll see the number you do at the end of this review. \\n\r\n     Luckily, the rather large supporting cast pick up a bit of the slack. From the members of the actual police force Antiskill, to Misaka's classmates, to the various adversaries that our main characters meet along the way, everyone has something to bring to the show. Hell, even the main character from A Certain Magical Index: Touma Kamijou will show up occasionally, and usually have very amusing interactions with Misaka, bringing up her well hidden tsundere trait for all to see. He's mostly just there as fan-service(the other kind) however, not really contributing to the main plot besides from one occasion, but rather distantly mention side-characters from Index and so on. The standout however, is Dr. Kiyama Harumi, who is probably the most well developed character in the show, at least in season 1. I can't tell you her exact role in the plot due to spoilers, but her motivation and personality are really well defined. I also like how she is just a little \"out of it\", sometimes asking off-topic questions or not reacting to situations in the way a normal person would.\\n\\n\r\n.C Staff have always been consistently good with their animation, but if I had to say, A Certain Scientific Railgun is probably one of their best works. The futuristic aesthetic they've given Academy City looks crisp and clear, and there is plenty of nice backgrounds to go along with it. Speaking of backgrounds, occasionally you'll see these wide sweeping shots of the city sky-line, and you can tell the effort that the production company have put into them; you could take a snapshot and put it as your wallpaper they look so nice. Fight scenes between espers, especially fights with Misaka are always cool to watch, but even ones without her, J.C Staff usually find a way to make it interesting to look at, and all around, everything is awesome, except maybe the character designs, which while original, never really did much for me, but that's a nitpick. And it only gets better, as I think I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Railgun S has the best animation that I've seen J.C Staff produce.\\n\r\n     I've been listening to the OST the entire time I've been writing this review, and I hardly even registered it. The music, done by Maiko Iuchi, sounds very bland and uninteresting, filled to the brim with all the slice-of-life jingles you've heard a million times before. And yes, there is music to compliment the more serious parts of the series, but it's nothing worth listening to twice. The only thing I'll give on the music side of things is that the both OP's, and the first ED of the anime are rather nice, and have good animation to boot. There's also two songs: \"memory of snow\" and \"Late in autumn\" done by the band \"fripside\", that are rather serene and calming, and at least beat out the counterparts by Iuchi on the OST that seek to achieve the same feelings. And even if some voices are annoying, I can speak well for the dub.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the flack I've had to say about this show(and I had a lot), I'm glad I was introduced to this franchise. There's a lot to like, and a lot to dislike, so ultimately it just settles around average, but it is enjoyable, with hints of actual quality spread thin throughout the series. If I had to give only one compliment to A Certain Scientific Railgun, or even the whole Index franchise as a whole, I'd say it is highly approachable. I think at least everyone can find something to like here, with the well balanced genres of comedy, action and scfi-fi. That's not something I can say for just any anime, so well done Railgun on being able to achieve at least that. At the end of the day however, I'd say go watch Railgun even if you can see yourself only moderately liking it. There is not a lot of franchises that get better as they go on, and while it's true that I can speak for both seasons of Index yet, I can for Railgun, and there's nothing much better than a steady rise of quality in a show. So yeah, both seasons, I ultimately recommend it. Go see them guys.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Never trust anyone with a lab-coat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)",

            "content": "Back in January, I watched a just licensed anime called \"A Certain Magical Index\". Which I thought was a pretty good show that was worth watching, with it's interesting world and likable characters, though at times it got too complicated and hard to follow at times. Though what made it worth watching was the secondary character, Mikoto Misaka. In a sea of basic stock anime characters, she was the most interesting out of them. Plus, watching her made me want to see more of this character, including her friend, Kuroko Shirai. But seeing how she was popular enough to get her own spin-off, I'm notthe only one. So, will this more Scientific \"Certain\" show live up to my expectations, or will I end up disappointed? Let's find out.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story (9/10) \\n\\n\r\nNow let me say that the scientific side of this world is a lot more easier to follow then the Magical side. Academy City is a city in which it's technology is three decades ahead of the rest of the world, where many people come to train to be espers. Some of which were born with such powers, whiles others were originally ordinary folk who had the potential to develop them. The ranks range from Levels 0 to 5. 0 being the lowest (As in, have no powers) while 5 being the highest, in which there are only 7 espers ranked Level 5. One of them being our main heroine, Mikoto Misaka. She is joined by three other friends, including her best friend and roomate Kuroko Shirai, Ruiko Saten, and Uiharu Kazari. All four of them go on action packed adventures exploring the more darker aspects of Academy City, as well as having their friendship for each other help them get by.\\n\\n\r\nThis side-story does a very good job explaining the basics and details of being an esper in this scientific city. Not only that, but it also explores the more psychological side of being an esper. If you replace the esper dream these girls have and replace them with your own, you would know how many of the characters would feel. You relate with working hard for your goals, or the fact that while you may try your best, you would still be stuck at square one. But that's were I talk about the themes of this show, and let me tell you, they're REALLY good. The main one being the power of friendship. The lessons of relying on one another, no matter how empowered you are, you will always need help. Or how your true friendships are much more important then things that you think are more important, but they really aren't. Not only that, but it has strong messages of \"Working hard for your goals\", \"Never giving up\", \"Be true to yourself\", \"Try again\", and \"Always stand up for your friends.\" All of which are very helpful in life.\\n\\n\r\nI even give credit to the fact that the fanservice does take a back seat in this. Okay it's STILL there, but it's actually treated as a small part of the show. The bigger part being the characters, their relationships with one another, and their inner hardships that they fight to overcome. Not to mention the story arcs having unique ideas that rely on sci-fi complexity, and have a subtle connection with one another. Filled with twists, backstories, and some very sentimental moments. And because that this is a slice-of-life show with a lot of sci fi elements, it really has that Haruhi Suzumiya-vibe to it. Achieving on every aspect Magical Index only did \"Okay\" on, makes this show one of the most surprisingly deep I've seen in any medium.\\n\\n\r\nThe Dub (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow we get into the more....\"Controversial\" side of this. At least in it's overseas release. Ever since the dub's trailer, it's gotten a lot of hate towards dub haters. (Which is not surprising) Me? Well, I actually tolerated it, though that's not to say I think it's perfect. Brittney Karbowski I thought was terrific as Mikoto Misaka. Capturing her tom-boyish attitude fairly well. Plus it's funny to hear her as Ayu Tsukymia and then as Mikoto. Kuroko Shirai was actually the first time I heard Alison Viktorin's voice. Now her english voice for Shirai might not be as funny to listen to as her sub voice, it still suites her character just fine. Plus, changing \"One-sama\" for \"Sissy\" was because the latter sounded more familiar towards American and European countries. Also, it means the same freaking thing, so calm your tits dub haters! Then there's Cherami Leigh as Uiharu. Now she is a character type that Leigh would usually play, just changing the little girl to a teenager, and she does an okay job as Uiharu. At least to a point where I can tolerate it. Plus, is it me, or does her Uiharu voice kinda sounds like Lisa Simpson at times? Last but not least is Brina Palencia as Saten, which is where I think most of the complaints come from. People complained that she sounded like a tomboy just like Mikoto. While I can somewhat see where they're coming from, I think there might be a reason to this. I think Saten's personality is in the middle of girly-girl and tomboy. She's not to much of one side, but not to much on the other either. Now Brina........only did a good job on it. Not great, but her voice for Saten can be fun to listen too. Funimation isn't always perfect with their dubs, but they STILL work hard on them. And their work here does show. At least to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow here is where we get into the strongest aspect of the show. Or in some cases, the heart of it. You see, the problem with Index's cast is, (While they are okay) they're for the most part copy/paste anime archetypes. Ones that we're use to seeing all the time at this point. Railgun's characters on the other hand, (While having their tropes) are a lot more 3 dimensional and relatable.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start out with our main character, Mikoto Misaka. Who on the outside, looks like your typical stuck-up girl due to her high ranks as an esper. But on the inside, we learn that she's really nice, flawed, and very identifiable. We learn that she was originally a Level One esper, but thanks to hard work, got to where she is now. Plus, her personalities very unique for anime standards. Sure tomboys are fairly common, but she's given reasons to act like that which can be seen for yourself while watching. Also, just because she's one of the most powerful espers in Academy City, doesn't mean she'll prevail. Which makes the action scenes more intense, and her friends very useful when the times right.\\n\\n\r\nThere's Kuroko Shirai, who's Mikoto's best friend and might have a possible love for her. Which could get annoying to some people, (And is mostly there to turn on the male watchers) but there is more to her character then that. We learn that she's very devoted to her role in life, her friends, and everything else that's important to her.\\n\\n\r\nKazari Uiharu is the Judgment officer along with Kuroko. Which is basically a junior police force in some cases. She does have the look of your typical moe girl (With a bouquet of flowers on her head to boot) but she's still just like the other characters. She's the voice of reason to Saten, and the straight girl to Kuroko's shenanigans. Plus, she's very devoted to every friend she makes, and I'm not just talking about the other main three.\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least is Ruiko Saten, who has to be my second favorite character. Why? Well, I feel that she's the one that's the most relatable of the four. She's known to be a Level 0 esper, which causes her to think that she's insignificant compared to her friends. Not only that, but no matter how hard she would try, she would always get little payoff to her hard work. Which causes her to make some decisions that would go against what's right. You know what? That makes her a very great character. She does make mistakes, and she does get into trouble for them (Mostly for the first story arc), but I can connect with her, understand her, and really care for her that way. I mean, I would do the same thing. But it's her growth as a character that makes you very happy when something good happens to her.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the main 4 girls are so colorful and unique (Only relying on one familiar character trait) and their friendship with each other makes the heart of the series, there are many times that I'm looking at a genuine soul. Now there are other characters in the series, but I feel that you just have to see them for yourself due to spoilers, and they aren't as worth mentioning as the main four. But other then that, this is a near-perfect cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis has some very catchy opening and ending theme music. \"Only my Railgun\" and \"LEVEL 5 -Judgelight-\" really due capture the esper and scientific feel of the show, while \"Dear My Friend\" captures the shows theme of friendship. \"Real Force\" has to be my second favorite song from this, the first being \"Dear My Friend\". Plus, there's also a special ending song for episode 12, but I wouldn't dare spoil it for you. You just have to listen for yourself. Every opening and ending theme has great visuals making you feel pumped up for what you're about to see. Not only that, but it does reflect on some of the aspects and themes of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nA Certain Scientific Railgun managed to live up to my expectations, and more. Proving to be much more entertaining than the series it spun off of. With it's more interesting and easier to follow side of the world and ideas they create, inventive ideas filled to the brim with sci-fi complexity, a lovable cast of charming characters, and some of the best themes that could be taught through anime. It's like \"Haruhi Suzumiya\" meets \"Azumanga Daioh\", and I do highly recommend this to anyone who's a fan of those two shows, or at least is a fan of slice of life animes. Now, it's kinda required to watch A Certain Magical Index first, just so you can understand the cameos from that series, as well as the fact it makes a good introduction to the character of Mikoto Misaka. Plus, a second season of this just started 2 days ago, and it's suppose to focus more on the Sister Arc from Mikoto's point of view. Which sounds VERY interesting, since she IS the heart and soul of that messed up project.....which you just have to see for yourself that is. Overall, it's one of my new favorites.",

            "content": "To be honest I don't find this show worth watching at all..\r\nThe abilities granted to characters are mostly random, lack any sense of logic, and don't contribute to the story at all, which is already weak. \r\nEvery episode, something goes wrong so that the esper team has to deal with. But since the arc of the Strip Lady who tried to save the her Error Children, it's always the protagonist Railgun that has to reap what she sows, handling problems one after another created by fault of her own immaturity, naivety, etc. (I want to say stupidity)\r\nOverall, all characters are weak in all ways, childish,spontaneous, fanatical, etc. even though they presumably possess great skills and knowledge in a futuristic world, e.g. hacking computers (lolz). Moreover, there is no particular growth in their personalities throughout the show. The character Saten may look like playing a triggering role in one or two arc(s) but her contribution to the story remains next to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nFor the espers, if you think about it, if you were in their shoes, you could even use those abilities in much better ways, you bet. Therefore, there's no feel of optimism or logic in both the flow and details, thus this isn't worth any entertainment value.\\n\\n\r\n3/10",

            "content": "I thought i'd write a review for the guys out there that have watched the parent story Index.\r\nI was 100% sure i would never watch this, it looked like a little girls show, and I wasn't wrong.  I was pretty bummed there was no news for a third season of Index, so I thought I'd give this a go and test the waters.\r\nIf you liked Index, you're almost sure to like this.  I got caught up in the clean lines and perfect pacing all too quickly.  Something about this anime series speaks to me, and just like Index, a show I alsowas skeptical about seeing, this Railgun grabbed me and didn't let go.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is so well connected that it rewards you for paying attention.  The writing is clever enough to pull it through even the lowest, slowest times.  Whle being about the adventures of middle school girls, it's hard to look at it like that.  The action was probably more central than the Index series.  Surprisingly, there may have been even less drama than Index as well.  All of the elements come together so well that you will soon forget about the context and focus squarely upon how much fun the show is.\\n\\n\r\nThe only major drawback is that the first railgun series does contain a few filler episodes, and in those, if you're a guy, it's definitely hard to relate.  However, the comedy and wit really prevails even through these so that it was next to impossible for me to skip an episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe other minor drawback is that it does touch on the cheesy side, but it was so rewarding i didn't really care.  \\n\\n\r\nYou know the art is top notch, the characters are all interesting, highlighting not just their strengths but their weaknesses. And while the show mainly focuses on Railgun, it's not shy about letting the supporting cast do some heavy lifting.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure I'll get some heat from my high score, but rarely have i seen an anime that mixes the elements of a good story so well.  It's, dare I say, even sophisticated enough to vault over shows that you may already hold in high esteem.  Not everyone is going to love it, but I find it hard to imagine that you will hate it.",

            "content": "When it comes to anime in general, more than often is there a tendency to get turned off by the words \"spin-off\". This is especially true when it involves taking an intense, action packed parent story and drawing from it a spin-off that is mostly about a group of cute girls doing cute things. After completing Index two years ago, I was all pumped and ready to get into Railgun, but I never really did that until now. I for one, was really attached to the characters of the parent story at that point, and it bothered me that we would not get to seeas much of them here. Mikasa Mikoto struck me as a very interesting character from the very start, but not interesting enough to follow for an entire series on her own. I watched the first episode of Railgun and thought to myself  \"Nope, not today I don't.\" It seemed interesting enough given the setting, but I was completely turned off by the drastic change in tone when compared to Index. Now that I have come back to the starting line and pulled my way through A Certain Scientific Railgun, my thoughts about the show were completely changed. After completing it, I can say that watching the show was quite an enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe show centers around four girls (Misaka Mikoto, Shirai Kuroko, Uiharu Kazari and Saten Ruiko) who come together in Academy city and end up becoming the best of friends. For me, the setting here was as interesting as ever. I was never a big fan off the magic side of the world of Index because of the direction that it veered off to, but the science side was always really interesting to find out more about. Inside academy city, we are introduced to a broad variety of characters as they go about in their daily lives in the city. In academy city, it seems that the amount of respect you receive by other people in general is heavily paralleled by the amount of power that you possess. Those that possess amazing power are highly praised (for example: other people's reception of Misaka in many cases) and those that lack it are often driven to lead their lives into more undesirable directions. There is a lot going on at all times in this lively city, and the city would often be plagued by various spontaneous occurrences. Those that keep order are divided into two groups: Judgment (those who aid in keeping daily order) and anti-skill who work more like a combination of the police and the military. We are introduced to quite a few characters throughout the show, and many of them were actually pretty interesting. But more importantly, the development of these minor/major characters has really done an amazing job of bringing the setting to life.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere isn't a whole lot to interpret about the relationship of our four main characters. Because of their bright and enthusiastic personalities, they easily get along with each other ever since their first meeting. However the ridge that really divides our characters is once again, a difference in skill level. Standing at the top is Misaka Mikoto, a level 5 esper who is the 3rd strongest in all of academy city. Her roommate Kuroko is also a strong level 4 teleporter (I just love this ability) and a game-changing member of judgment. As nature would have it, Uiharu and Ruiko (levels 1 and 0 respectively) do feel a certain degree of helplessness when it comes invert desire to become stronger. While they would continue trying their hardest to improve their abilities, this difference in power is what would eventually prompt Ruiko to use the level upper as a shortcut to becoming stronger. As a result, her friends are able to finally understand a bit of what she is going through as someone who completely lacks power.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere is of course, a degree of fanservice in many forms in the series as well. One of the more obvious cases lies in Shirai Kuroko's perverted nature and the obsession that certain characters other have with the type of underwear that other girls wear. Episodes like the one where they become swim models are mostly geared towards fanservice but they do end up being decently enjoyable one way or another. On the other hand, we are occasionally offered a glimpse of our main characters from Index, leading fans of index around with a carrot in hand. It was pretty nice to see Touma and Index again, but they are not really involved in the plot at this point.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe overarching plot that develops throughout the series revolves around Kiyama Harumi as she desperately tries to save the lives of the child-errors she was once forced to teach and later abandon to an experiment she had no prior knowledge of. As someone who is willing to go to the ends of the earth to save these children, she certainly takes many drastic measures. I really felt bad for her when Misaka looked into her past though, because who wouldn't experience agony after going through what she did.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe antagonist in the last arch, Threstina, really made me roll my eyes a bit though, because it honestly would have been better in my opinion to make her \"betrayal\" come as more of a shock. Instead, they have her with a menacing grin in the background since the very beginning, so there was no surprise there. Though I guess it would be hard to disguise that level of insanity.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe battles play out pretty nicely throughout the story. The esper powers are really interesting to observe given the wide variety of powers that are introduced. My favorite is Kuroko's teleporting power. It seems so useful on a daily basis while also being a lethal weapon in battle. Being a level 5, Misaka's power does stand out quite a bit. Her control over electricity is supreme to an extreme point. I must say, I raised my eyebrow the first time she used her electricity to stick herself to the wall. The final battle came in a series of intense sequences. The power play shown was interesting, and we get a glimpse of Kongo Mitsuko's level 4 ability as well (which is a pretty nice ability as well).\\n\\n\r\n\tProduction value-wise, the animation was really solid throughout, and the art was really nice and pleasant to look at. This is something that I think has really improved since Index. Overall, A Certain Scientific Railgun was an enjoyable anime to watch, and we see lot of development of a world that I have indeed become quite invested in.\\n\\n\r\nMy score: 7/10 Good~\\n\\n\r\n\tI really look forward to anything else that the author has in store for the future.",

            "content": "This review will cover both seasons of A Certain Scientific Railgun.\r\n\u201cYou use other people\u2019s power as an excuse for your own weakness. There\u2019s almost nothing more pathetic than that.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Kuroko\u00a0Shirai.\r\nAnime spin-offs to well-known series\u00a0are a tricky beast to execute. On one hand, anime spin-off can take all the things that the original series established and expand it by bringing in new concepts and ideas to the table aka\u00a0Digimon\u00a0Tamers. On the other hand, they could run the high risk of repeating the same mistakes that set original show made or even make worse ones in the progress cough Soul Eater Not. Thankfully A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0least, forthe most part, fixes almost everything that I hated about A Certain Magical Index. Now when I first heard about\u00a0Raildex\u00a0series I was pretty intimidated of the timeline of the series because it was pretty confusing. When I asked people on the net about what series should I start in the\u00a0Raildex\u00a0timeline. Many of them pointed toward A Certain Magical Index because they said I would have a better understanding of the story. However, after hearing mixed opinions of A Certain Magical Index on the net I decided to freely bench watch both season A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0series and I absolutely loved it. Now as the years went by as I started to see more anime as well buying anime on\u00a0Blu\u00a0Ray and DVD and re-watching it a month before Season 3 of A Certain Magical Index my opinions for both Seasons of A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0has changed. Don't me wrong I still think it's a good series and I still it's one of J.C Staff better shows I just don't love it as I use to. Now with that said let's dive in.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nIn the futuristic Academy City, which\u00a0is made\u00a0up of 80% students, many of who are\u00a0espers\u00a0possessing unique psychic powers. Mikoto\u00a0Misaka\u00a0is an\u00a0electromaster\u00a0who is the third strongest of a mere seven\u00a0espers\u00a0who have been given the rank of Level 5. The series focuses on the exploits of\u00a0Mikoto\u00a0and her friends;\u00a0Kuroko\u00a0Shirai,\u00a0Kazari\u00a0Uiharu, and\u00a0Ruiko\u00a0Saten\u00a0and the adventures at Academy City.\\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings for the story for A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun. Before I talk about the stuff I didn't like let's talk about the stuff that I liked first.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters compared to Index the story is a lot more clear and focused meaning there isn't much\u00a0cryptic stuff that goes is happening especially in the background side of things.\\n\r\nThe one thing that I really liked about A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0is the character interactions. They are pretty funny for the most part. Most of the characters have great character chemistry with each and the conversations between the four girls as well the other characters inducing the villains were pretty entertaining.\\n\r\nAnother that I liked about the series is how the series was able to explore its themes because Outside the slice of life stuff the show tackles a lot of serious themes of cloning, loneliness,\u00a0levelling up,\u00a0Perseverance and the show goes a great job attacking themes in sets arcs of the series.\\n\r\nThe Sister's\u00a0arc\u00a0of\u00a0Railgun\u00a0from Season 2 is easily the best thing to come out from this series because that arc itself was not only well written and directed but it also beautifully characterize\u00a0Misaka\u00a0as a character. It's such a shame that the rest of the arcs in\u00a0Railgun\u00a0minus the pretty good Level Upper Arc were not that great as they are sadly pretty average at best\\n\\n\r\nNow with that, all said let's talk about the show flaws because there are a lot of them that at times plague the series.\\n\r\nFirst up the pacing. Compared to the ridiculous fast pacing in A Certain Magical Index, A Certain Scientific Railgun\u00a0is much slower and while I appreciate the slower pacing of the show and I will admit the show took good advantage with the shows slower pacing as it was able to\u00a0establish\u00a0the world as well popularly develop its characters. The problem with the show pacing is how at times the show can ridiculously at times to a point where am just watching inferior K-on clone While this is not a problem in season 2 as that season was for the most part pretty well paced\u00a0its\u00a0season is where it kinda becomes a big issue in some areas.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly the\u00a0worldbuilding. Now I admit A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0actually tries to properly establish\u00a0its\u00a0world compare its parent A Certain Magical Index but the problem is that it's not properly explained to the viewer.\u00a0The function of\u00a0academy city, how\u00a0esper\u00a0powers work none of that\u00a0is explained\u00a0or they kinda but it was done in a half-ass faction where the show only explains the first half of the information about the world while the second half of it doesn't get expanded at all. I honestly don't know why this franchise has a difficult time about properly establishing its own world to the viewer. Image if\u00a0Fullmetal\u00a0Alchemist 2003 decided to completely cut out the intro in episode 1 explaining of how alchemy works and instead\u00a0the first scene of\u00a0Fullmetal\u00a0Alchemist 2003 has Edward and Al drawing circles in the ground as talking about alchemy thing. You would be completely lost and as a result, the viewer would become very confused about what is going on. Lucky this problem, for the most part, is\u00a0tamed\u00a0compared to Index as this problem doesn't happen as\u00a0often since this show most part, is a character-driven and because of that, I can kinda let this problem side here. I just hope that Railgun\u00a0Season 3 fully fixes that problem.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the filler. Now am no manga elitist where I shit on any anime adaptation because it's doesn't follow the source material perfectly, in fact, I open filler in anime as long they\u00a0are done\u00a0right as\u00a0well-being\u00a0entertaining to watch. The filler in\u00a0Railgun\u00a0says otherwise. The filler in the second half of season 1 was okay at best and while the writing and directing was clearly not as good as the first half it was still pretty fun and decent experience. However, I cannot say the same thing for season\u00a02 filler\u00a0aka Silent Party\u00a0arc\u00a0because that was pretty bad. It was so bad that fans of the series stated that\u00a0Railgun\u00a0S2\u00a0ended at episode 16 and\u00a0to be\u00a0honest I didn't watch the Silent Party arc on my first watch as my friends that arc was the second coming of Beach arc of Nadia The\u00a0Secret\u00a0of Blue Water which I\u00a0absolutely\u00a0despised. I did\u00a0eventually\u00a0watch it on my re-watching from start to finish and let me tell you I wanted to remove my\u00a0Blu\u00a0Ray disc on my\u00a0PS4\u00a0because that arc was so badly\u00a0scripted\u00a0and contrived that it really annoyed me to no end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall while the story has a lot of good\u00a0moments\u00a0as it did gave us the amazing sister arc it's was\u00a0unfortunately\u00a0hindered\u00a0quite a bit thanks to its lack\u00a0of\u00a0actual\u00a0explanation\u00a0of the world as we the crappy Silent Party arc.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nWhile the story suffered\u00a0quite\u00a0a bit in terms of wiring and directing the characters for the most part completely make it up.\\n\r\nMisaka\u00a0is\u00a0an awesome\u00a0character that I really liked. Not only she is a pretty well-written character especially in Season 2 where she greatly develops as a character but she is a very relatable both narrative and personality. Now at first, you don't know much as and you know that she is one of the most powerful espers in Academy City however as the series progresses you will start to see that there is more going on into her character outside of her reputation. For example despite being one of the most powerful espers in Academy she has this incredibly childish tastes that she tries to cover up due to her reputation as is obsessed\u00a0with her frog character named Gekota that look it came straight from kindergarten. This detail alone really makes Misaka a more\u00a0relatable character as that's how a lot of people react to the guilty pleasures especially of her age where is 14 years old. As for her development in the series well I sadly can't talk about because that would be a massive spoiler for the whole series but what I can say it is emotionally driven and\u00a0well thought out. Overall Misaka is an amazing character and she is easily the second best thing to come out this anime right behind the amazing Sister Arc of Season 2 aka Railgun S\\n\\n\r\nKuroko\u00a0is an interesting character because she is the character that seemed to a lot of hate and while I understand people don't like\u00a0Kuroko\u00a0I don't think that Kuroko is as bad that many people say she is. In fact, after my re-watch, I actually started to like her.\u00a0 Yes, she\u00a0may be\u00a0annoying at times thanks to lesbian loving gag about\u00a0Misaka\u00a0but when she's not doing that act she is actually\u00a0a\u00a0likeable\u00a0character who pretty good development in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nRuiko\u00a0is a pretty great character and she's easily my favourite character in the show that is not\u00a0Misaka.\u00a0 I really how the show devolves into her internal conflict that she is has no\u00a0espers\u00a0ability and how she to live/deal within a city that\u00a0espers\u00a0are the number 1 quality that people\u00a0are measured\u00a0by. It was one of the few things that I actually was\u00a0interested\u00a0in this\u00a0esper\u00a0world.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have my least character out of the main four Uiharu.\\n\\n\r\nShe was just a\u00a0bland character on-screen who did nothing for the show plot expect acts like the four-wheel for the group while she isn't bad or anything as in her character interaction with the other girls was pretty\u00a0solid but other than that she was, unfortunately, pretty one note.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters in\u00a0Railgun\u00a0they are actually pretty\u00a0solid.\\n\\n\r\nTouma\u00a0who is the character that I grew to hate in the Index series is actually pretty tolerable here as he\u00a0doesn't\u00a0show up\u00a0all that much in the series and even when he does show up\u00a0he's actually a pretty decent guy. It's such a shame that we don't see this\u00a0Touma\u00a0in his own series.\\n\\n\r\nAccelerator is a pretty fun and villain that I enjoyed a lot in the Sister arc of\u00a0Railgun\u00a0S. The same thing can apply for\u00a0Harumi\u00a0for season 1 in\u00a0Railgun who is a pretty good villain in her own right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters, for the most part, were excellent and very enjoyable.\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0is excellent.\\n\r\nJ.C Staff did a fantastic job with the art and animation as the show is very smooth and clean not to mention it's very well animated. The character designs while the same from the original series is much sharper this time around especially in\u00a0Railgun\u00a0S where certain scenes the characters look absolutely beautiful.\\n\r\nThe animation in The show is very good\u00a0that is filled\u00a0with smooth movement and wonderfully animated fight scenes.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0is pretty good as they all work well with the show setting and actions scenes.\\n\r\nAll the opening and ending themes in the show were great and very enjoyable to listen.\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe subversion was pretty good for the most part as it filled with solid\u00a0Seyiuu\u00a0performances though I was not a fan of\u00a0Kuroko's Seyiuu\u00a0as I thought she overdid it to a point where she sounded like an old woman.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub, on the other hand, is actually very good.\u00a0Brittney Karbowski did a fantastic at voicing Misaka as she brought more life and personality to an already awesome character and the rest of the cast did a great job with the roles that they were given\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nSo after re-watching A Certain Scientific\u00a0Railgun\u00a0what do, I think about. Well, I liked it. While I still don't the series has held up as other animes that I re-watched in the past like\u00a0Toradora, Outlaw Star\u00a0Ouran\u00a0High School Host Club and\u00a0Cardcaptor\u00a0Sakura\u00a0but still, it holds up more than the likes of Angel Beats, Both Seasons of\u00a0Clannad, Fairy Tail and Nadia The Secret Of Blue Water. The story has some interesting things, the characters were pretty great and, the visuals were impressive, the music is awesome and the sister arc was wonderful. It does fall short in a couple of areas though. The world building was pretty lacking, the pacing was at times was too slow for its own good and Silent Party arc of Season 2 is not that good. Despite that, I still enjoyed this show for what it worth.\\n\r\nI still like you A Certain Science\u00a0Railgun\u00a0but not as much as I use to.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 7.5/10",

            "content": "The manga storyline was very slightly, and I do mean very, intriguing, and since the anime is rated so highly, I decided to give it a chance and hope the animation would not be the typical fake glossy stuff we get now, the voice acting would not be shrill typical moe quality, and that the promised added details and stories would be interesting. Unfortunately, every one of those hopes was failed.\r\nFirst of all, the art and animation is mostly terrible. Sure some of the movement is \"slick\", but the animation is always glossy, the character art is as bad as you would expect from themanga made worse with coloring, and the awkward zooms and movement during action scenes ruins any hope of excitement. This is definitely not enjoyable to look at any time in the episodes I watched, and was cringe inducing with the bigger mistakes (like during the first episode with the first time she fires lightning, and her face practically melts).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is terrible shrill typical bad moe stuff. Not a single character sounded good, and even as someone who hates this type of fake \"cute\" voice acting I usually find that some will sound good. Furthermore, the sparkly sound effects are again cringe inducing.\\n\\n\r\nThe added details in the story so far involve more bad gags (like HRHR LOOK AT ALL MY SEXY PANTIES or THE STRIPPER LADY!!) and not much else. Yeah, some extra \"depth\" to the characters was added in like episode 6, but the additions were not interesting because the characters were not interesting. For the first couple of episodes, the extra slice of life storylines might be nice for some people, but I spent the first two episodes skipping to the action after a few exasperated minutes.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that this seems to be an already extremely typical manga made into a typical anime that was very poorly executed. The action scenes I skipped to hoping for something to salvage matters were really bland...just nothing worthwhile here as far as I can see.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "After watching both seasons of Toaru Majutsu no Index, reading all 25 light novels, and catching up to date with Index's manga, I turned to Railgun in the hopes of seeing something with a great plot and great characters - and was disappointed. \r\nAs a person who watching Toaru Kagaku no Railgun's parent story Index first, I understand that my review might be biased and compare the two a little too much. I loved Index - the story, the characters, the music - and since Mikoto was one of my favourite characters, I had high hopes of Railgun being an entertaining story full of scientificabilities - something I loved about Index. \\n\r\nUnfortunately, Railgun didn't live up to my expectations. The story line was good at some points, boring at others, and too ecchi for my liking at times. Kuroko's perverted behaviour towards Mikoto, which wasn't so obvious in Index, was blatent to the point of being disgusting at some instances. \\n\r\nThis isn't to say I don't like Railgun. I do. But as someone who adores Kazuma Kamachi's works, I find this spin off no-where near as good as Index. \\n\r\nSo, overall, I give Toaru Majutsu no Index a 10, and Railgun a 6. \\n\r\nPlease remember this is just my opinion; I am aware that there are a great many people out there who love Railgun.",

            "content": "Let me start off by getting the more controversial stuff out of the way first: This is going to piss a lot of people off, but...I honestly liked Majutsu more than Railgun. The thing I liked about the ToAruVerse was this whole dark mystery surrounding the Magic world. I honestly didn't care much for the Science side. Touma didn't nearly come across as annoying to me as he did with most people, and I just loved the priceless comedy associated with his misfortune. Whilst there was plenty to lol about in Railgun (most of the comedy coming from Kuroko), the comedy wasn't as funny tome. Not to mention that the entire main cast is female. I don't know about the rest of the guys, here, but I need a male character I can connect with. Emotional involvement with the characters is important to me, when watching an anime, and I just can\u2019t get that much from a bunch of girly-girls. Plus Railgun has a lot more 'easy going' feel of things, and I liked Majutsu's \"Dark and intense\" feel better. So in the end, Railgun was never really going to be better. Not that it wasn\u2019t much worse. I really love the ToAruVerse but I gave Majutsu a 7, because of it's many flaws and I stand by that. Railgun doesn\u2019t deserve anything less than a 7, though as well. So I guess Railgun is merely just a somewhat weaker 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe Level Upper storyline was great and all, but it only consisted of a few episodes and relied on a lot of single episodes at the beginning to set the scene. The episodes that followed afterwards weren\u2019t that great and were average at best, except for the last episode which I think ended strongly, despite some clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only two things that prevent me from giving this show a 6: Saten and Kiyama. Saten is quite easily the best character in the series for me and is definitely on my favourite character list. It\u2019s not just her warm bubbly and quirky personality. I sympathised with her easily in her struggles in the Level arc thanks to how unbelievably human she was and it produced one of the most emotional scenes I\u2019ve ever watched: her breakdown over the phone with Uiharu and Uiharu\u2019s following encouragement. And what\u2019s more was that, unlike other anime, it was followed up on, even after the Level Upper arc, showing that psychological problems can\u2019t be solved so easily with Epiphany Therapies and the like. Kiyama didn\u2019t win my heart as much as Saten but she came close. Her closure in the end was wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nThis comes as a bit of a problem now, because I suspect that if there is a second season of Railgun that follows on to the Sisters arc, we won\u2019t be seeing much of Saten nor Kiyama anymore. Nonetheless, though the science side of the ToAruVerse isn\u2019t my favourite side, it\u2019s still a side I like a lot and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how Misaka become so broken as she did in Majutsu. Kind of irritating how they didn\u2019t announce a second series for either Majutsu or Railgun, but Railgun has proved quite popular so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bound to happen. Here\u2019s hoping.\\n",

Staff (of Shakugan no Shana, Shigofumi, and Toradora! fame) anime adaptation of a manga of the same name conceivedby manga artist Motoi Fuyukama and light novel author Kazuma Kamachi. With direction by Tatsuyuki Nagai, script by Miya Asakawa and Michiko Ito, and character designs, original and anime, by Kiyotaka Haimura and Yuichi Tanaka, respectively, we follow the adventures of Misaka, an important supporting character in the series' parent, Kamachi's A Certain Magical Index (which later became its own anime and manga), the most powerful electromaster as well as one of the strongest espers in Academy City, and her friends, Kuroko Shirai, Kazari Uiharu, and Ruiko Saten. Emphasis on her companions, being that while the show is named after Misaka's nicknames, it covers them quite a bit as well, who they are, what they're feeling, and the bonds of friendship they strike. Nevertheless, the show doesn't forget its roots, making numerous references and cameos to people and events from Index itself. Touma Kamijou, Index's main protagonist, takes the similar role as Misaka did in his series by makes his recurring rounds as support. And to be perfectly honest, I like how he's shown here rather than there, where his goofiness doesn't seem so exclusive from his solid moral stances. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is divided into one portion directly from the source, the Level Upper Arc, and anime original stuff, the Big Spider Arc, the Poltergeist Arc, and all the character specific episodes in between, to provide some breathing room for the next big arc in the manga, presumably to prevent an exhaustion of future adaptive material while leaving enough time to give the existing unadapted print some justice on screen, among other things. Particularly notable of this series is its constant use of foreshadow to create a sense of escalating tension and commitment to every character introduced. Minor, yet deliberate details, seemingly out-of-place snapshots, suspicious after-thought abnormalities, throwaway characters that don't seem all that throw away, develop to become something major in the future. Speaking of throwaways, aside for child errors, this show has few, if any. Many a side character is given a considerable degree of spotlight despite their status and are either retired properly, rather than abruptly, or go on to become relevant in future events, laying the groundwork for an overwhelming amount of potential and immersion. The backgrounds are beautiful to look at and contribute a necessary sense of scale to the world building that's evidently being sought for, but also adding a personal note, localized enough to be able to share, in sincerity and intimacy, the experiences of our main heroines. The animation is solid, funny in that exaggerated sort of way when a joke or gag is being played, and thrilling when the story calls for it. \\n\\n\r\nThe likelihood of whether or not you'll like this show will probably weigh heavily on whether or not you are able to enjoy slice of life and its slow paced nature. Railgun is both important parts this and action, the latter more saturated in Index. If you don't find slice of life in general boring, if you're dispositionally inclined in taste or open-minded enough to enjoy it, the next issue that needs to be addressed with this show before taking the next step forward to actually watching it is whether or not the everyday feel of these segments have a purpose. The more famous and infamous instances of slice of life in this medium fall under the category of \u201ccute girls doing cute things,\u201d and while it may be alright for those shows to feature such, it isn't for Railgun. It presents itself as something more. The purpose is to show characterization taking place, not tell, from how it is to how it evolves, something that sees the main cast, plus much of the supporting cast, as persons, instead of one word to one sentence stereotypes, something that Index, the anime and the character, has trouble illustrating properly. In spite of their abilities, espers are people too, with all their flaws. \\n\\n\r\nSame goes with this show's namesake Misaka, who, in addition to being the Railgun, the 3rd ranked Level 5, and yes, tsundere, is also very much a person of many facets: independent, proud, sometimes to the point of headstrong and hot-tempered, child-like in her tastes, yet fussily contrarian when she's called on it, and fiercely loyal. She has a heart of gold and lightening, but foremost, she's a girl who wants nothing more than a relatively normal life (as normal as it can get for someone with esper powers) with the people she treasures. These traits of hers slowly, but surely, are put inside a crucible and put to the flame as much as they are gradually built up as the city's darkness becomes more and more manifest. A similarly impressive level of characterization occurs with Saten, who happens to be Level 0.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the city itself, the show's setting, which is a character in and of itself, its breathtakingly advanced central core and its seedier outliers and underbellies that mirror the metropolis' own host of social successes and failures as well as science's accolades and excesses. Evident, for example, is Academy City's own brand of class discrimination and human experimentation. It's a utopia and dystopia, all in one... never a dull moment in this city, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAside for a slice of life, which is more or less you have to take or leave, the issue I have with Railgun is the disparity in the quality of the script. While it may be said that Kamachi had a hand in creating every story angle, it's evident that the writing that is \u201cdirect from source\u201d is stronger and more confident than the writing that is \u201canime original\u201d or, using a more connotationally derogatory term, \u201cfiller,\u201d often relying on the aforementioned numerous Index cameos to carry it through at times. It's always welcome, but its never a substitute for decent storytelling, though it doesn't go overboard. However, the main problem lies in the anime original plot threads rather than the episodic pieces. A lot of interesting ideas are juggled, to be sure, using the universe and previous happenings to its advantage, but the content, probably a mixture of time restraints and less talented authors, are unquestionably more straightforward and convenient in its execution and conclusions compared to the manga material, to the point not capitalizing on the potential of certain aspects of the story and overlooking others in spite of the show's diligence in keeping everything tight and focused, examples being the identity and backstory of Poltergeist arc's major antagonist and the functionality of a railgun. A railgun isn't a particle beam cannon. A particle accelerator, on the other hand, can... no, I'm getting ahead of myself.\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs \u201conly my railgun\u201d and \u201cLevel 5 -judgelight-\u201d follows Index's lead of techno inspired music, electronic embellishments and synthetics to complement the melody which, this time around, is fist-pumping awesome... I mean, upbeat, and band, this time around by J-Pop group fripSide, who made their debut and fame with this anime. The audible transitions synchronize perfectly with the animation sequences, which always seem to be bustling with activity and energy as scene after scene, flipping character, setting, and plot device, saying so much about everyone and everything shown without a need for a single word. Noteworthy in some positive ways is the musical introduction to OP1 and the scene with Misaka firing her Railgun. For the former when the noise drops for suspense and black turns to a vibrant, electric color before the music kicks into full throttle. For the latter, when it mirrors her mixture of concentration and confidence at performing her signature move. Noteworthy in a negative way is the spoiler for the villain of the final arc. \\n\\n\r\nThe EDs \u201cDear My Friend -Mada Minu Mirai He-\u201d or \u201cDear My Friend -Towards an Unseen Future-\u201d and \u201cReal Force,\u201d the latter more upbeat than the other, by one of my favorite Japanese singers, ELISA, in my opinion, an amazing singer who with an equally amazing sense of range. My only contention about her at times is that she likes a lot of Engrish in her songs, which shake me up whenever she puts it as a point for emphasis. The exception is a special insert ending song also performed by ELISA, \u201cSMILE -You & Me-\u201d re-purposes ED1's melody while replacing the original lyrics entirely with English while discarding all the extra background music for a soul crushing classic guitar, soul suspending cello, and soul sublimating keyboard accompaniment with an equally impressive vocal. Never mind the heavy Japanese accent (the words are still pretty comprehensible by ear regardless), this level of elegant, yet evocative expression is exactly why I'm such a fan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you don't mind watching girls living their lives while being badass to the side, then by all means, watch it. There's that aspect, the wonderfully thorough characterization, Academy City, and whole lot more to conceivably enjoy. And while it helps, as it does its best to come off as its own tale (the cameos, save Kamijou, are mostly just cameos, a superficial bit of appreciation for people in the know) you don't need to watch Index to understand the substantial bits of it. It just adds some extra world building, scale, immersion... what have you.\\n\\n\r\nI give A Certain Scientific Railgun an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "This will be my first review here, so beforehand I\u2019m sorry for my bad English, incompetence and stuff.\r\nOnce upon a time I was looking for some Shana-like sci-fi action and this is how I got my hands on Toaru Majutsu no Index. It has cool setting so I like that show. Then Toaru Kagaku no Railgun came which I was looking forward to. Indeed, the same setting, more Misaka and no Index, who I think was annoying sometimes; so yeah, that\u2019d be great series, it seemed.\r\nNow I can tell you what, Railgun\u2019s not great. Well, it\u2019s not bad either, it\u2019s pretty much average show aboutmagi\u2026 I mean, esper girls. So does it deserve watching? If you have free time, then yes, because Railgun is one of the best average shows I ever saw.\\n\\n\r\nThe good art, catchy opening themes and the whole conception of the series are the strongest points here. Characters\u2026 well, they\u2019re a bit stereotypical with moe elements and a bit of yuri fanservice but basically that is not bad (there\u2019s Misaka, guys) plus we have nice character development throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo why is it not great? The first point is that the plot progresses really slow. It\u2019s viscous like nougat. In one episode you can see a lot of action with some epic battles, which drives you excited, but then you get three episodes of some random back stories, centred on a side characters and stuff. It\u2019s pretty rough and enjoyment level shakes like sinusoid, so I think this anime would be better if it was in 12 series format.\\n\\n\r\nThe second point is a subjective thing, so it can mean nothing to you. Well, y\u2019know, I\u2019m one of those people, who think that Railgun lacks Kamij\u014d for tsundere Misaka. Yeah. I\u2019m not too fond of harem anime but for me it seems that Railgun needs some kind of male lead or something. That\u2019s why I like Toaru Majutsu no Index more and that\u2019s why the moments when Kamij\u014d appears on screen were one of the most awesome parts here.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I really enjoyed this anime but I think that it\u2019d be better if JC Staff released more Shakugan no Shana or Majutsu no Index instead of Railgun. Am I right or not, it\u2019s for you, guys, to judge, so you can always watch the series and decide yourselves.\\n\\n\r\nI rate this four points for visual and sound parts, plus two points for setting and plot, and plus one more for Pika-chan\u2026 I mean, Misaka. So seven points out of ten in total. That\u2019s it.",

            "content": "Railgun is one of those rare shows that I'm willing to rate on just enjoyment alone. That's not to say things like story and characters aren't important, but Railgun doesn't particularly win you over with any of those. This is popcorn fare through and through, but the characters are so likable and the effort is showing at every turn, that even I can't turn my nose up to Misaka and her merry friends.\r\nThis is saying a lot because for the most part, I can turn my nose up to Index if I want to. It certainly wasn't a bad show, but as I said inmy review of it, it was disposable eye candy. Nothing particularly memorable. For the most part, Railgun would have been the same if it hadn't made up where Index failed.\\n\\n\r\nThe character interactions alone make this series worth the watch. I love a good \"four girls doing nothing\" anime when the four girls all have their own different ways of interacting with each other and when none of the girls are stereotypical archetypes. Even though Kuroko is batshit lesbo for Misaka, that's only one side of her personality and we see many different forms of interaction with the other girls. With Uiharu, she plays a capable mentor to her lack of confidence, and so long as she's not around Misaka, she's as normal as any of the other girls. Likewise, Misaka goes totally tsundere when Touma makes a cameo, but she is not ruled by her tsundere qualities. She has a strong sense of justice that makes her narrow-minded in certain situations, and she keeps a lot of her personal preferences guarded from the others. As a \"four girls doing nothing\" series, it works, but it doesn't stop there.\\n\\n\r\nOnce in a while, Railgun decides it wants to have a plot, and when it does, it goes into it heart and soul. This is even more fascinating because the final stretch is 100% filler and yet it brings all the character growth and final revelations to the table that one expects from a solid conclusion. If no one had told me I was watching filler, I would have believed this was canon material. It is just that good, so good that in fact I'd say it makes up for the consecutive standalone fanservice filler that preceded it.\\n\\n\r\nThe technical qualities are still as good as Index, with the voice acting being even better. The voices were unique and done well enough that they felt like genuine performances and not just throwaway roles, especially Uiharu's from Aki Toyosaki, a seiyuu who I am genuinely starting to warm up to despite a rocky introduction to her work. But I digress.\\n\\n\r\nRailgun isn't the best anime. It doesn't have the best anything for that matter, but it does have a lot of heart. It cares about seeing the relationships of the four girls grow. It cares about having a plot that's always there, though not always the focus, and tying up all the loose ends rather than saying \"LOL WAIT FOR SEASON 2\" at the end. But above all, it asks for nothing more than to be enjoyed and it does so without excessive pandering. Given how much anime is tailor-made these days to certain fetishes and archetypes, that is nothing short of wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give To Aru Kagaku no Railgun an 8 out of 10.",

Friendship is nice and all, but its not going to cause a miracle and allow them to punch outside of their weight class. There is a reason that railgun is labelled as the kid zone of the toaru series.\\n\\n\r\nAlso having Misaka denying the claim is a joke, especially later on, which shows YES, she is a lab rat, living in her little comfort zone, while the big boys solve the real issues.

            "content": "This anime's name is tremendously long, therefore I'm gonna refer to it as 'railgun' from now on.\r\nHaving watched To aru majutsu no index and enjoyed it, I went into this with relatively high expectations, especially considering how likeable Mikoto is in Index. \r\nUnfortunately, like that neighbour who you always thought was a nice person but who'd actually been poisoning your plants these last few years and leaving dog shit on your doorstep, Mikoto is not all she seems, or perhaps she was in index and they just wanted to create a character who could out-self righteous the main character from index (to the point thatit would make the characters from freezing seem open minded) in the spin off.\\n\r\nWhatever you want to believe one thing is for sure. Mikoto is not a likeable character in railgun. But we'll get to that in the character segment.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this show is arc based, like Index, with an overarching plot that revolves around a teacher/scientist with a chronic condition that causes her to get the impulse to strip suddenly without warning and usually in public (whom I will henceforth refer to as stripper teach) and her quest to save the kids she unwittingly sold to a doctor death type scientist who enjoys human experiments that go bad simply because it gets him up in  the morning... OK maybe that last one was a bit exaggerated but it is essentially the gist of the problem.\\n\\n\r\nLike in index, those rascally scientists are still trying to create the elusive lvl 6 super esper and like in index they've taken a less than moral approach to it and it's up to Mikoto and her chums to save the day and stop the bad guys. \\n\\n\r\nnow don't get me wrong, I'm quite fond of science tbh and I'm also in favour of a little morality in science and thus I enjoy a show which prizes itself on highlighting the dangers of abusing science for your own gain. And while this show is just such a thing, it does it incredibly badly.\\n\\n\r\nThe level of immorality in the science in this show is just damn awful and unbelievable, and considering how strict and highly regulated this city is they sure get away with a tremendous amount of mass murder. But perhaps we should address the regulators in this city.\\n\\n\r\nthe police force are divided into two groups, the SWAT like group and the main investigation and minor arrest group called judgement, the latter of which is almost entirely run by....kids. Whose great idea was that. And it just so happens that Mikoto's sexually frustrated lesbian friend Kuroko (whose suicidally unrestrained lust for Mikoto is only marginally shown in index) just happens to be a member. With kids running intelligence no wonder the cities full of lunatic eugenicists.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, whil;e index had a ridiculous plot of it's own this show outdoes itself to the point where it becomes an \"are you kidding me\"  kind of series. but never the less it'll get your emotions boiling which is to its credit, however most of your anger and outrage will be directed at how poorly this city is run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in the show much like in index is superb and very modern without adding the obvious 3D effects in. It's highly polished and fluidic so it is a sight to behold, the battles between Mikoto and her enemies are quite breathtaking but I feel that the animators didn't experiment enough with her ability and end up making it seem somewhat underwhelming at times.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects where pretty good and the crackling sound of Mikoto's lightening is visceral and realistic. The music is modern and has that electronic rock sort of feel however while the main theme is good and works as a finisher song for when Mikoto finally decides to do what she could have done at the beginning of the fight to finish them off, the rest of the music is barely noticeable and relatively uninteresting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nNow to get back to my panning of Mikoto as a character. She was likeable in index because she had that Yankee quality to her mixed in with a cute personality that sort of came through beneath the surface which coupled with her insecurity about her tastes (many of which indicated her childish character) made her seem genuine and cute, but once you drag her character into the main heroine chair she quickly cuts the appeal away. As a side character whose childish attitude conflicts nicely with Touma's realist and defeatist attitude but as a main character her childishness just makes her irritating.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially when she's spouting her self righteous, \"quite complaining about being weak and try to become strong\" speech...sheesh, she sounds just like another group of people I've heard about, hmm, who where they?, oh yeah it's the republican party in America who always like to say \"why don't quit complaining about being poor and just work harder\", I digress, but you can see the similarities and I'm not entirely convinced that her character wasn't created to draw attention to this problem with governments around the world, since she's just as hypocritical.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the anime we get a glimpse of how Mikoto's path toward god-like power began with a scientist helping her raise her power to the max when she was a kid because her power could save lives....uh huh...right. So basically she talks about working hard, but like the republicans she was given the advantage over everyone else, in this case, help from an expert to get where she needed to be. Never the less she tries to tell people off for saying they can't do things cause their lvl 0 that with her power she finds easy (usually fighting more powerful opponents). \\n\\n\r\nBasically Mikoto is naive to a stupendous degree, since she believes that people without power shouldn't complain and work harder despite living in a city where having esper powers is everything and if you have none to speak of you're basically cast aside as useless cannon fodder for the various people who abuse that power. (only about half way through the show do they actually start helping these people develop their abilities, or develop abilities period) and Mikoto tends to come save these people by using her electric power to kick the bully's ass then turns around and basically says see how easy it was for me you should be able to do the same....see how unlike-able she is?\\n\\n\r\nThat's basically like a tiger going up to a dog that's half dead because he picked a fight with a lion and saying \"I could have taken that lion on easy, you're pathetic\" despite the fact that the dog is small and at a greater disadvantage. Again I digress, needless to say during the anime Mikoto's fantasy world where everyone can become powerful if they work hard is usually shown to be complete nonsense regularly and she tends to constantly make naive and stupid decisions despite the clear and obvious answer (refer to the last arc, where she has to choose between stripper teach and crazy ponytail chick with a chip on her shoulder.\\n\\n\r\nMikoto has power but no responsibility, and do you think she learns from her mistake? sorta, but not really. She makes the same damn mistakes over and over again like a rat that still hasn't figured out that the left button gives a shock but not the cheese, and every time she makes a mistake that puts other people in jeopardy she never pays for her mistakes and in fact the very fact she was the one who put them in that position because of her stupidity is never addressed by any of the other characters and they act like it never happened, no one goes up to her at the end and tells her that it's her fault and she should live with the consequences of what happened or could have happened, therefore she doesn't have to feel the weight or guilt of her mistakes and so she doesn't really learn form them. In reality, she would have been slapped and told that she's too stupid to be trusted with big decisions and she tends to always make the big decisions because she's powerful and hat gives her opinions precedence and she does use that power to force her opinions on others. Yet she's fighting the guys abusing their power,  how ironic. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the other characters Kuroko's depravity and obsession with Mikoto was so understated in index, in this show she's essentially a rapist exhibitionist who gladly drops the soap if you catch my drift, she is so disturbingly debauched in this anime that I couldn't believe my eyes, and her character is so all over the place, one minute she's serious and strict the next minute she's salivating at the mouth and man handling Mikoto despite the fact she gets shocked almost every time (seems Mikoto isn't the only rat looking for the illusive cheese that never seems to come from pressing the left button) her level of debauchery and tantamount rape make her equally unlikeable and ultimately disturbing. as for the other two Saten and Uiharu their characters are so weak and overshadowed by the insane and over the top behaviour of Kuroko and your anger at Mikoto that they just seem pretty negligible and only seem to be there to balance the power tables of the group since they have practically no power what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhether you can enjoy this anime or not is dependant on how much you like the fight scenes really since their pretty awesome, but the characters just tend to irritate you or in the case of Kuroko disturb you, so it's a matter of preference, and honestly there are only two likeable characters in this show, stripper teach since she seems to be the only character with a decent attitude to the world she lives in, no fairy tale outlooks, no preaching about how she's better than you, and she seems to be the only character that's really had any development in this series, and accelerator since he doesn't take crap from anyone and seems to be somewhat responsible with his power by comparison, (using it to keep everyone from disturbing him rather than using it to get an edge in life).\\n\\n\\n\r\noverall I've ranted quite a bit, but meh, this show isn't as good as index by a mile but there's certainly some enjoyment you can get out of it. \\n",

However, this was not a bad thing as each story is interesting on its own. Well drawn visuals and characters make it quite a good watch. Also, both ending and opening songs are worth listening to.\r\nThe problem starts when some story development starts, which could have been executed better. In fact it may have been better if it was left out and the anime had kept to its comedic style.\r\nDespite its one major weakness, Railgunis enjoyable enough and I recommend this to anyone looking for some casual viewing.",

Nothing but retarded storylines and moeblobbery whenever the creator felt like it.\r\nI will try to keep this as spoiler-free as possible, but beware regardless.\r\nThere was nothing wrong with the art/sound quality, they were the same as in Index. However, the storylines were much less enjoyable and...Kuroko was prevalent. \r\nKuroko's main purpose seems to be just the moe loli lesbian. Her shrill voice coupled with her annoying actions make her an extremely bad character. She's not as annoying when she's being useful, butas most of the scenes in Failgun seem to be just the characters messing around, the bad highly outweighs the good.\\n\\n\r\nSince I could go on for pages about how much I hate Kuroko, the only reason I didn't rate this a 1 in character is because she's the only horrible one. Even though Mikoto is a tsundere (the bane of my existence), she's actually not too bad, at least compared to other characters I have seen (Taiga, Louise) from other anime (Toradora, Zero no Tsukaima). Uiharu is an airhead (which do annoy me from time to time) and I actually grew to like Saten after a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe story arcs were awful. At first, it was trying to be cute and funny, but after a while it started to get \"serious.\" I put it in quotes because it was all extremely lame and unbelievable. And here is where the minor spoiler comes in. The end of the first \"serious\" arc completely spat in the face of science by playing binaural beats through speakers, when they actually require the sound to be played through stereo headphones to the recipient in order to work at all. And this is what resolved everything. And this really should stay true to some kind of science, this anime even has science in the title! \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you truly appreciate Index and science, stay very far away from this side story. It's not worth watching even one episode.",

            "content": "Toaru Kagaku no Railgun seemed like a  stereotypical moe blob anime with random 'fanservice' thrown in for no reason; however after sitting down and viewing it I have to say it was surprisingly better than what I had expected.\r\nSo let's break this down, \r\nStory: For the first five or so episodes, there is virtually no continuous storyline. Each episode in the beginning is just a variety of random happenings that the girls of 'Judgement' must fix. By the time you get to some actual story you won't be able to help but say 'Finally.' That is not however to say that the early episodesare unappealing, if anything they are just as good as the storyline episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This anime is very well animated, the art style is visually appealing, the characters are distinctive and the city itself is quite a mouthful as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound is pretty generic for the most part, nothing particularly outstanding here other than the OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are very likable, and are the main attraction of the series. You'll find yourself laughing with them, or sharing a heartwarming moment with them as they go along, the character voices are very fitting and help make the mood complete. Aside from the main cast, there are several other characters introduced throughout the series, however most of them, at the very least for the most part, early on play no role other than to be fillers. This is my only complaint so far.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The anime itself is very enjoyable, It has enough going on to keep watchers attached to the screen, the blend of action and comedy is done very well and it is an overall enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd give this anime an 8, it's a very fun and easy going anime, it doesn't takes itself too seriously, and it's a blast. I'd recommend it to anyone who's in need of something to watch.",

It's powerful, it's shocking, and it sparks with brilliance. What better ways to describe Railgun than with all those words? This is the energized spinoff that does everything better than Index.\r\nSwitch on the power. We're going to let all these cheerful cuteness and electrifying excitement flow through the circuit. As opposed to Index's focus on magic, Railgun places an innovative emphasis on science. The kind of science that's not really science but more like conceptual science, granting a magical and mysterious vibe. Structured from serious followedby episodes of lightheartedness, the story is able to flow more seamlessly rather than jumping from arc to arc in a confused mess. Having episodics and serious arcs may be a weird structure at first glance, but there's an advantageous side to this. Delving into the everyday lives of four girls unlocks investment, giving way for us to care and worry about the characters when they deal with the nasty sides of science. Their outward appearance may say entertainingly cute, yet they hold a deeper persona than mere adorableness. Through a multifaceted perspective, thoughtful themes and ideas from morality to guilt and innocence of victims are explored with intrigue. None of the characters are the same. Their power and background differs and this creates various developmental focus, notably Saten who feels like a useless underdog along with the competent tsundere by the name of Misaka. Despite their differences, it's clear that in the end, their friendship is something meaningful. Side characters are also given focus so we can understand them further but not necessarily for development. The most negative part I find throughout is the comedy. Many of them are recycled, sometimes appearing at the wrong times and stunning the mood quite awkwardly.\\n\\n\r\nAcademy City, while technologically ahead of its time, is a city that looks very similar to our first world cities. Regardless, a futuristic setting can still be felt with its blue tinges and subtle glints, reinforced by a number of techs surrounding the metropolis. And among the buildings of this city is a world full of espers, situated in a life of daily activities or energetically charged with hidden secrets as they fight and protect. Sending a rush of rapid excitement, fight scenes can power up to overflowing exhilaration in a matter of light speed. The slick animation helps in achieving that as flowing smoothness makes up for an engaging action. But there's no denying the sound effects of powerful electricity and other abilities amplify it even more. Everyday episodes have consistent animation, entertaining me with character expressions that show their personality and humor. It's like two sides of the same coin. I could describe the atmosphere as a fierce adorableness because of the seamless switch from bubbliness to graveness. The seiyuus allow both spectrum to be expressed. The reminders of a CGDCT is felt with their cheery voices. Then the hype of a battle Shounen takes over when their voices turn to serious determination. An assemble of varying soundtracks also supplement with these transitions, fabricating all kinds of mood. While bland at times, the more calming to the reverberating tracks pin the mood in place, so they serve reasonably well. On a more kickass note, the opening songs have electrifyingly cool beats that really gets me going and the ending songs are just as great.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Railgun is the improved addition needed for the Toaru series. Similarities executed differently, Index short-circuited its ideas while Railgun maintained its flow of charged-up ideas with consistency. Truly a certain awesome plasma.",

            "content": "I think the expression ,,spin-off'' should have been kind of changed for some anime. Some of those, like Railgun - show us another side of whats happening.\r\nTo Aru Kagaku no Railgun , or like in english ,,A Certain Scientific Railgun'' is an anime side-story from To Aru Majutsu no Index, a famous novel book series and naturally also a manga & an anime.\r\nThe same like Index, Railgun sets of in the city called ,,Academic City'' a city that is 30 years in front of humanit in things of technology and thus they have managed to grant their students super powers, the espers.\r\nThe beginning is alittle bit weird, if you will. We see the main protagonist Misaka standing on a bridge, she opens up a drink and relaxes there before some thugs come over the way attempting to hit on her and maybe harm her. Little do they know, that they are the ones that will be harmed. Before her friend Kuroko , from the security group ,,judgement'', arrived- the thugs already lay defeated on the floor, a little bit coaled while a few sparks still flew around them.\\n\\n\r\nIt is in my opinion a little bit too fast paced and action scenes jump out of nothing, which can be interesting for some but also a little bit confusing for the next. What you will realise during the watch is the exagorating of a matter. Like in the very first episodes where they have to deal with a stalker that tends to tase strong espers from a known school.Kuroko and her partner Uiharu went to their Office to investigate as her colleague wanted to show her picture with an dark atmosphere like ,,Watch on your own concern.'' It makes you think that the victims were stabbed, penetrated, cut everywhere, punched and ready for hospital....and it turns out that the stalker only drew big eyebrows on them. I couldnt stop laughing there, but for others it may be a pointless exagoration. \\n\\n\r\nI dont know what to say much to the Artstyle, im a fan of the drawn animes, instead of using too much CGI or 3-D effects. Railgun stays well in those boundaries and amazes with flashy fights and absolutely cool attacks. Just like the sound matches up to the situation, you always knew when a certain beat came up then shit had hit the fan and misaka starts to go out for real. It is kind of a techno mix, yet i wish some themes would have likely taken out. For example, there will be a very annoying piano theme when kuroko gets too attached. It is durable the first 2-3 times and i know its supposed to be annoying but at latest by the 5th time you will be like ,,Oh god..here we go again..''\\n\\n\r\nRailgun also does not do much more then basic character progression, the only characters we learn about are Saten Ruiko and Harue and a small bit from kuroko and uiharus past but besides that it is unfortunately a bit left out. It is not that you feel that you need more backstorys etc. It is one of those ,,Wanna know more ? read the wiki/novel/manga'' progression. Something that might could have done better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed Railgun very much, i laughed , it was exciting and the flaws i mentioned didnt draw my attention away. I personally hope that we can see more from this exciting universe, it surely seems to be fun.\\n\\n\r\nMy Score is a tough loved : 8\\n\\n\r\nI hope my review could have been helpful to you guys. Dont let yourself be fooled by other saying ,,its a Shoujo manga'' it certainly is not :) with an open mind , you are guaranteed to have fun watching railgun.",

            "content": "It's been a while since I have watched an anime that moved me to the point of immediately writing a review about it.  I'm not going to sit here and over analyze this anime.  I hate doing that, and I don't enjoy reviews that are written like that, I'm just going to keep it simple. This anime was fantastic! I actually spent an entire weekend watching it, I don't understand why I'm just now getting around to this I wish I would have found it sooner.\r\nStory- Railgun had a pretty interesting story.  Of course I'm not going to go into much detailhere I don't want to spoil any of it. It really reminded me of an RPG.  There were a few arcs in the anime which were later tied together. \\n\\n\r\nArt- The art was beautiful, very vivid and bright colors. the sceneries were very detailed and the characters were well done, not too over the top but also not too bland. \\n\\n\r\nSound- This anime has an amazing soundtrack. Only thing I can say I didn't enjoy about the soundtrack was the Op1 and Op2 sound the same lol. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The characters could have used a little more development but I'm not really complaining. I think it was wonderful how they all had their own personalities, and none of them seemed boring to me. I'm a little bias i'm a sucker for these types of relationships (I'm a huge fan of anime's similar to K-ON). The interaction between the girls was warm and welcoming.  all of the personalities were a little cliche but call me crazy for saying this, i like cliche's. there were alot of cute moments between them as well, as well as serious ones and comedic ones. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Like I said, I'm not going to over analyze this anime. I kinda feel like that will take away some factor of the enjoyment for some.  This anime was very easygoing for the most part and there were some action packed moments which will leave you on the edge. It was interesting seeing all the different abilities, would have been nice to see more of them though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think that anyone can find enjoyment in this anime. I didn't find much wrong with it, I was skeptical to watch it at first because I read somewhere that it had Yuri undertones, which was wrong imo. The yuri moments were more for comedy it appeared.",

            "content": "I am seriously in love with this Anime. I have never watched an anime as good as this one. This anime is called: A Certain Scientific Railgun.\r\nI love the story line. In the beginning, there wasn't much plot but then it progresses a lot! \r\nSummary: There is the city called Academy City and it is around 30 years more advanced than the rest of the world. A lot of people want to get in. The people who are in this city are ranked between level 0-5. Level 0 is like a nobody, no one really pays attention to them. Level 0's has no powers whatsoever.Level 5's have the most power and only 7 people are level 5's. Level 5's all have nicknames given to them by the city. They are like celebrities. Anybody who has a power (which is level 1 and above) are called espers. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Mikoto Misaka and she is totally awesome. She is a Level 5 and is actually ranked third in all the 7 people who are also ranked level 5. I really like her because even though she is a level 5, she is very modest and doesn't boast about her power. She has the power of electric and her nicknames are: Railgun, Number Three, Ace of Tokiwadai, Strongest Electromaster, and Electric Princess. She is my absolutely favourite character of all times and I just love her! She's so powerful and has the best personality ever! She also goes to the best, most prestigious, and most renowned middle school, Tokiwadai Middle School.\\n\\n\r\nA major character is her roommate and best friend, Shirai Kuroko. Shirai Kuroko is also a really cool character. She is ranked as a level 4 and has the power of teleportation. She can teleport herself, others, and object anywhere she likes. She is a member of judgement which is one of the securities in Academy city. She is a really funny character but others may find her annoying. She has a crush on Mikoto Misaka and always gets electrified by Misaka when she tries to hug or grope her. Same as Mikoto Misaka, she also goes to the same middle school. \\n\\n\r\nAnother major character is Kazari Uiharu, usually called Uiharu. She is a level 1 and goes to another middle school. She was a big fan of Mikoto Misaka and was delighted when she finally got to meet her. When she meets Misaka, they become fast friends and get close. Uiharu has the power to keep food warm when she is holding it. Uiharu is those types of people who are very cute and like a child. Uiharu is a very sweet girl and hardly ever gets mad. She always wants to help people.\\n\\n\r\nThe last major character is Saten Ruiko, usually called Saten. She is a level 0 and goes to the same school as Uiharu. Saten and Uiharu are best friends. Saten always flips up Uiharu's skirt. During the anime, Saten becomes very self-conscious that she is only a level 0 and has no powers whatsoever. She becomes stressed and depressed and later on finds out a way to get powers. She gets the power of nature, but not for long. Gaining that power had a lot of side effects and was later taken away from her. \\n\\n\r\nTokiwadai Middle School is a very prestigious and renowned middle school. Only the best out of the best can go there. You have to be both a very high level (either level 4 or 5) and be rich. This school is super famous. Anytime Misaka Mikoto and Shirai Kuroko go out they have to wear the uniform. Everybody can recognize that uniform. Also it is once told that a member of the ROYAL family applied for that school but was told that she was not good enough. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also really awesome!\\n\\n\r\nThis is my Review, I really give this a 10 out of 10. I love it so much!\\n\\n",

            "content": "I still remember the time when my friend thought this anime was a bunch of lesbian girls fooling around. Tbh, that's what I thought too. I decided to give this anime a try and after watching 1 episode, I immediately got hooked. I guess I was 5% right about the lesbian part.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nThe show is basically a spin-off to another anime show called \"A Certain Magical Index\".  When I first started watching this anime, I didn't know it was a spin-off. The show is focused on Mikoto Misaka, one of the lv 5 espers in Academy City and her friends which I'm going togo in depth in the characters section. \\n\r\nThere are 2 major plots and a lot of little adventure plots for the first season. The 2 major plots are the \"Level Upper\" incident and the \"Poltergiest\" incident. Now my opinions. If you watch this anime as a stand-alone like I did without watching \"Index\" then prepare to be somewhat confused at the plot. I eventually understood everything. After understanding everything, I found the story to be great. It tends to be not very serious which I like.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 10/10\\n\r\nIf you read my little introduction above then know that was my 2nd reason why I started watching this anime. My very 1st reason is the Animation. For a show that was made back in 2009, the animation is wonderful. I'm probably going to get some hate for this but the animation is 2x better than AoT and F/Z. My comparisons are probably unfair because those shows have darker animation and this one has fun and colourful animation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this show is great... Especially the battle themes and some \"joke\" scenes where they used funny soundtracks. Oh god, the battle theme, especially the end. It actually gave me a goosebump for over 10 mins. The 1st OP was amazing and 2nd OP was ok but not better than 1st OP. The 1st ED and 2nd ED are in par. They're both equally amazing\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nI absolutely love the characters in the show. The only character I find a bit annoying is Uiharu but she's still a great character nonetheless. When Mikoto and Shirai are paired up, it makes the show funnier and great. Likewise when it comes to Uiharu and Kazari, it also makes the show funnier. The characters are well developed with some episodes focusing on one of the characters, flashback, etc.\\n\r\n I'm only going to introduce the 4 main characters and not the supporting and antagonists.\\n\r\nMikoto Misaka, one of the seven LV. 5 espers that can emit electricity, immune to electricity and can shoot a \"railgun\" by flipping a coin and the main protagonist of the show. Some or most people think that she's a normal lady or an asshole that looks down on people who has low level than her but on the inside she's a short-tempered, prideful, and improper attitude girl who has a wierd obsession with kiddy things. Shirai Kuroko, a LV.4 esper and works for Judgement. Her powers is teleportation. She is Mikoto's best friend and has \"feelings\" for her which is obvious when you watch the show. Ruiko Saten, one of Uiharu's friend and a LV 0. She has a weird habit of pulling Uiharu's skirt up and she's almost useless when it comes to battle. Uiharu Kazari, a LV. 2 and a friend of Shirai. She also works for Judgement which also makes Shirai her colleague. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nThere are a lot of funny moments on this show and that's one of my reasons why I enjoyed this show so much. The show did confuse me a bit when it comes to storytelling and timeframe. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nThere's a reason why this show didn't get a perfect score from me. The timeframe is a little bit messed up, fanservices, and a few cliche's. However, it got a 9 from me because of great story, great characters, perfect animation, great soundtrack, and great character development. If you like anime with fun atmosphere then this is the show for you. If you like anime with seriousness and a lot of action then this is not the show for you. If you're also going to consider skipping this show because it's full of girls then you're making a big mistake but I won't stop you. I'm actually re-watching the series right now in English Dub and I still love it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Great story\\n\r\n-Lovable characters\\n\r\n-Perfect Animation\\n\r\n-Great soundtrack\\n\r\n-Great character development\\n\r\n-A lot of funny moments\\n\r\n-Show does not take itself seriously\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Timeframe is a bit messed up\\n\r\n-Fanservice\\n\r\n-Few cliche's\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First a disclaimer, I wrote some crap at the bottom that should be read first, but it ended up being more then I planned so I put the review portion up top and an explanation for some people on my thoughts of how some series of this nature get conflicting reviews.\r\nThis is a slightly episodic (with some story arcs, or at least events from multiple episodes tied in) series. However, it really should be approached more like a fusion of slice of life anime, and action. If you don't like slice of life, you probably won't like this anime, or at a bare minimum youwill be bothered by the structure of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI endorse this anime (as I would any that I personally write a review for) mainly for the fact that it was very enjoyable. I wasn't expecting to be moved to tears, or have some life altering moment watching this series, my only expectation is that the show is interesting enough and entertaining. I have found myself kind of moving away from high octane action shows (which used to be somewhat of a staple), and perhaps it is like an acquired taste. I really ended up liking the supporting characters (since paragons really aren't all that interesting, but unrequited lesbian love is), and got a good many laughs out of this series.\\n\\n\r\nSo this is what I guess is a somewhat unpopular view for how to rate things. But on the topic of entertainment (especially when I read what other people have to say about shows like this one) some people tend to have difficulty just watching things and basing them completely on their own merits. Meaning that when I review, I try not to constantly compare one series to the next unless what I feel the \"intent\" of the shows are consistent. (the intent of this show I feel is somewhat misinterpreted, its not JUST action/super-power, its also slice of life, which got misinterpreted as \"filler\" in my opinion, but in the entire series a lot of what happens occurs between or within slice of life applications).\\n\\n\r\nTo that extent this series I feel is somewhat underrated on MAL since a lot of what I read about on this site referred to this show having filler, a term which I think people like to use all too freely. I felt it was necessary to write a review from the standpoint of someone who does not mind when shows are not necessarily geared to be 100% serious or follow tight story arcs. That being said, I also don't read all the manga/light novels and whatnot, so I don't judge anime based on how it follows the original.\\n\\n\r\nLOL, lastly I don't write any of the plot summery or that kind of bull in my reviews because you can just freaking click on the link and read it yourself if you really need to. Redundancy FTL, I notice how much people like to talk plot specifics in their reviews. I only offer my perspective to highten my own sense of self satisfaction, hah you read it now you can't unread it if you read this far!",

            "content": "Note: This will be a review of the first two seasons.\r\nOverview:\r\n\"A Certain Scientific Railgun\" is the spin-off of the science vs. magic series \"A Certain Magical Index\". While the former series focused primarily on the Magic Side of things, \"A Certain Scientific Railgun\" focuses exclusively on the Science Side, and puts us in the shoes of one of its most powerful espers, Mikoto Misaka, otherwise known as Railgun. While the series is definitely essential viewing if you're a fan of the franchise and does a good job at fleshing out the Science Side, I personally think that it's not quite as good as \"Index\". \r\nStory& World (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThe story takes place during the events of \"A Certain Magical Index\", though it actually opens a couple of weeks before it. Mikoto Misaka, one of seven Level 5 espers, is a student at Tokiwadai Middle School in Academy City, a highly advanced city dedicated to the development of psychic powers and where there is never a dull moment. Mikoto, along with her friends Kuroko Shirai, Kazari Uiharu and Ruiko Saten, the former two of whom are members of the law enforcement group Judgement (which consists entirely of young girls for some reason), works to protect the peace of Academy City from those who would threaten it, all while uncovering some of the city's unnerving secrets and mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that \"A Certain Magical Index\" focuses mainly on the Magic Side, having some extra world-building for the Science Side is definitely appreciated. In Academy City, espers are divided into 5 levels, with normal people being designated as Level 0s. Mikoto is one of seven Level 5s, making her extremely powerful, while her roommate, Kuroko is a Level 4, which while not as strong is still very impressive. The stronger you are, the more comfortable your life is, thereby making lower level people very jealous. This gets really explored in both seasons, and the dark underbelly of the city becomes especially apparent in the second. Now, I understand I'm being a little vague here, but to say anything about the major arcs is a huge spoiler. Trust me, I'm doing you a favour.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, there are quite a few issues. The lack of magic in the series is kind of disappointing, since the science vs. magic theme is exactly what makes the main series so great. And while some could argue \"Index\" went too fast, I personally found \"Railgun\" to be pretty slow, which certainly isn't helped by the fact that more than half of the episodes are anime-only. The first arc of the second season particularly suffers from this problem, as it takes up nearly two-thirds of the whole season, which is especially tedious if you've seen \"A Certain Magical Index\", in which case you know full well how it's going to get resolved. Overall, while I would say \"Railgun\" edges out \"Index\" in terms of storytelling, in terms of the overall world, \"Index\" is the winner.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (9/10):\\n\r\n\"A Certain Scientific Railgun\" is animated by J.C. Staff, the same people who did \"A Certain Magical Index\". Therefore, it looks exactly the same as that series, by which I mean it looks fantastic. The characters looks great, the environments look great and the effects of the various powers look absolutely fantastic. There are a few instances of gratuitous fanservice, but that didn't really bother me, and to dismiss it as bad-looking just because of that would be ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (9/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is overall really good. There are four openings throughout the two seasons and all of them are worth listening to, albeit not every single time. My personal favourites are \"Only my Railgun\" and \"Eternal Reality\". The voice acting is similarly excellent, with Brittney Karbowski vocing Mikoto just as well as she does in \"Index\". Besides her, there's also quite a few favourites of mine in prominent roles, most notably Colleen Clinkenbeard, Brina Palencia and Cherami Leigh, the latter two of whom voice Saten and Uiharu respectively. I can definitely say the sound is one of the show's strengths, just like the parent series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nI can't say we got to know Mikoto very well in \"Index\", but here we get to see how she acts around people other than Touma. Despite being a Level 5 and coming from a rich family, she is generally very friendly and kind to people, and makes friends with people very easily. However, due to her high status, she is also quite naive, and slowly starts to become more cynical after learning the darkness of her city, which shows how she got where she was in \"Index\". Overall, however, I just don't like her as much as Touma or Index (who only has a few cameos here), since as I stated in my review of \"Index\", her power and overall personality is pretty generic in comparison to theirs, and she's overall just a lot less likeable, though that's not to say I don't love her regardless. She's joined by Kuroko, her best friend and roommate who was only a minor character in \"Index\", and a member of Judgement. She can be quite annoying at times, largely due to her obsession with her \"sissy\". In the second episode, she attempts to celebrate the day one month after she became roommates with Mikoto as if it's an anniversary, even though as Mikoto reveals, she manipulated her way in there. There's also the fact that she's a teleporter, something she uses to its full perverted potential, which often borders on sexual harassment. Fortunately, this is balanced out by her being kind, selfless and a very responsible person who takes her job at Judgement very seriously, making her a very likeable and well-developed character.\\n\\n\r\nNext up, we have Uiharu, Kuroko's co-worker in Judgement. She's not much of a fighter, but she still won me over easily due to her kindness and really shy nature, both of which make her absolutely adorable. Last, we have Uiharu's friend Saten, who is easily the weakest link. Despite being a main character, she does almost nothing throughout both seasons. Part of this is due to her being a Level 0, but even beyond that she has no distinguishable personality traits. She's kind, energetic, likes flipping Uiharu's skirt... and that's pretty much it. Even during an arc that you'd think would focus on her, she ends up in a coma and doesn't wake up until after the conflict of that arc is resolved. Her obvious role is to provide a \"normal\" perspective to the franchise's world of badass, but the fact that we hardly ever see things from her point-of-view and she gets put on the sidelines in the second season means she comes off as the load if anything. All of that being said, I can say that she gets a truly AWESOME moment in the final episode of season one. No spoilers, of course, as it has to be seen to be believed.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is pretty good, but they're called the supporting cast for a reason i.e. they don't get nearly as much screen time as the main characters. There's also a notable lack of prominent males. \"Index\" has a lot of female characters but it still has its guys (two of the main characters are male, after all). By chance that a male character does come in here, odds are they're not going to last very long, unless their name is Touma Kamijou. It just feels ill-fitting to have an improbably female cast in the same universe as the (mostly) gender-balanced \"Index\". Overall, this is a category that suffers in comparison to \"Index\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\\n\r\nI won't deny that I was sometimes pretty bored watching \"Railgun\". This was mainly the case in the first season, as the main arcs of the series took too long to get going. There are plenty of great action scenes and comedy, however, and when the main arcs do get going, you will absolutely want to watch them to the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n\"A Certain Scientific Railgun\" is a great addition to the franchise, which does a fine job at fleshing out the Science Side of the \"Index\" verse. While I didn't like it as much as \"Index\" and there are quite a few pacing problems, I still believe that any fan of \"A Certain Magical Index\" should watch this as well, especially if you're a hardcore Mikoto Misaka fan. For more on \"A Certain Scientific Railgun\", be sure to look out for my review of the third season, which is due to air sometime in 2019.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n8.5+9+9+8+8.5=43/50=8.6/10",

            "content": "First off, im only on episode 15 right now. i've tried watching this before, but i got bored and ditched it. This time around, i pushed myself to watch it and started to get interested. . . and seemingly, the more i watched the more i began to like it and wouldn't stop, and i had to write a review. . . so here goes nothing.\r\n-\r\nStory:\r\n Well, it's fairly interesting and actually pretty unique for once- i thought it would be kind of like D. Gray Man, what with the new-problem-every-episode-or-two plot. I generally hate that kind of stuff and start to get sick ofit very fast, and nothing besides extremely good humor will keep me watching. Well, for ACSR (for the sake of this review, i'll abbreviate the title) it was kind of like this at first. I thought it was nice, but not really my thing- i was staying pretty much for the comedy. However, i did like how the problems per episode were different from other cliche, girls-with-special powers episodes, so that booted the score up a little bit and got a 8/10 from me.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n The art is fantastic. The one thing that will stop me from watching an anime or manga, despite how good or funny it may be, is the art. If it's not my preferred type, I often dump it- sometimes, I even have to force myself to not get irritated by the art when watching an anime/ reading a manga with a good plot. Fortunately, I don't have that problem with ACSR- everything is drawn exactly the way i like it, and the best part was that this anime isn't one of those recently released ones with better art- this anime is 2-3 years old already. The character expressions are drawn perfectly to show how they're feeling, and the details are amazing- I usually ignore details and focus mainly on the characters, but I couldn't help but notice. 10/10.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n Everything was perfect as far as sound was too- the crackle of Misaka's lightning, the voices of the other characters, the background noise, and the OP and ED's especially. The sound went perfectly with the art, which was another thing I loved- the only thing I thought that didn't fit was Kuroko's slightly annoying voice, although I did get use to it by episode 10. I expected her voice to be more smooth, although still haughty and naughty. (Haha. . . *shot*) Her voice irritated me a whole lot when I started watching ACSR, but as I said, I got use to it (although I still dont like it.) However, every other character's VA was perfect and so was the extra noise and the music used. Since Kuroko can be considered a main character and she talk alot, my rating for the sound went from a ten to a nine.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n 10/10. It was perfect. At first I was worried that the characters would be so cliche and that Misaka would be ridiculously and unrealistically heroic and brave. That's the thing I hate most about a large amount of anime- the typical, predictable characters. The characters are all unique and awestrucking, but not in a way that just looks fake and stupid and makes you want to smack them and be like, \"BUT THATS NOT EVEN POSSiBLE!\" I can't show examples because that would spoil most of ACSR, but just trust me, you will love the characters. I would love to be friends with any of them.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n Enjoyment & Overall: \\n\r\n I enjoyed it quite alot- there was a lot of things that made me laugh, but made me emotional as well. The characters, despite not being particularly busty like most characters nowaday, are still eye candy while not necessarily being all lolita and cutesy. (Not that i have anything against lolitas. . . in fact, i love lolita fashion. Well, then again, i love all fashion. . . ) Overall, i would give it a 9/10. The story was better then i expected and fairly good, the art was wonderful as was the characters, and the sound was pretty damn good. \\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nif i change my opinion drastically after watching a few more episodes, i'll re-write this review, but i sincerely doubt it. The ratings are rather good for an anime i just started watching and it doesn't look like this anime will end badly.",

            "content": "This anime takes place in a city where, despite being full of people who have superpowers, bullying takes place as an everyday matter. If there's a lonely girl, a gang of punks will surround her for harassment duty. If two people collide, one will try to beat the crap out of the other. This will happen without aggressors thinking about the possibility of being facing a serious threat.\r\nI would have been interesting to see more of how this world works. I don't know how espers train, level up or discover their own powers. Instead, I know how they... have fun. Hum.\r\nThere's a big amount ofnon-arc episodes, about six or seven for each twelve episodes: you get this slice of life and then there is your story. This seems a bit excesive, as some of these episodes involve even tertiary characters which do not even appear quite much (anti-skill girl playing at an arcade, for example).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it is interesting. But first half is way better than the second, because of the plot and it's evil final boss. Demiboss is better characterized than the final one. I have to note that being this a sci-fi anime, it makes use of science to develop its story. It is not just an excuse for renew a repeated theme, it plays with the limits of what a human being is and even sets up interesting premises. I think I will watch Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are light-hearted and not very complicated, but they work fairly good. Kuroko is probably the best one, partly because it has the best voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nSound is OK. First opening is one of best I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nArt is correct. Characters seem not very sexuated as they have mostly stick thin legs.\\n\\n\r\nGood:\\n\r\nFirst half of the series.\\n\r\nEvery time crazy Kuroko moans \"onee-samaa\".\\n\\n\r\nBad:\\n\r\nFiller non-arc episodes can KO you.\\n\r\nEnding is rushed and a bit dissapointing, also is second best to mid-ending.\\n\r\nEvil laughts are stupid and an intent to cover character vacuum.

A Certain Scientific Railgun follows Misaka in her endeavors with three of her friends, that occasionally overlap with the events in Index, but for the most part stays as a separate story. There is a technologically advanced city, that is 30 years further in science than any other city in the world known as Academy City, and in this city live people with powers like that out of a fantasy book, espers. The anime follows the story of our protagonist, Misaka,who is the third most powerful esper in Academy City, as she and her friends solve crime, fool around, and uncover the darker side of Academy City. There are times in Academy city when it is happy and calm, but inside the city is a darker side, one which directly affects Misaka, and she might be the only one able to stop it. I watched A Certain Magical Index before this, and while it was good, it lacked something. This picked up what it lacked. The events in this anime are basically what happens in between the episodes of Index, but it is shown by a different main character and cast, which results in a completely separate series. The character development is great, and it expands onto the times Misaka appears in Index, and introduces a whole new cast with their own quirks and objectives.",

            "content": "When I first heard about this from the MAL news, I decided to watch this, without watching the parent story (Toaru Kagaku no Index) since it would really influence my views on Railgun.\r\nYes, there are some random filler episodes, but this series was meant to be watched on TV, after all. The storytelling is well-done, since they explore various characters, such as the dorm mistress and the useless Antiskill member, in isolated episodes. For them, this is their moment to shine and shows that the Academy is multi-faceted. Plus, there is some fanservice, which can be annoying but anyone can skip over. I'm really notthe one for fanservice, but it's not too overdone.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the episodes that might seem isolated are actually connected in some way or another. I liked the Level Upper arc and the Poltergeist arc as well -- they are all connected together as part of a greater conspiracy in the Academy City.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Misaka and her friends get caught up in this. The character development is quite nice, though there isn't a drastic change. Rather, if any, it is quite subtle. The best development shown so far, though, was that of Saten. As a friend of Misaka \"Railgun,\" Saten in contrast has no abilities (Level 0). Yet, as the series progresses, Saten's views towards abilities do change and help further the theme of friendship and relying on one another.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are some characters that can be annoying, such as Kuroko -- that one pink haired girl. Despite being a highly capable Level 4 teleporter and a member of Judgment, she does have her GL moments where she attempts to make Misaka fall in love with her. They can be amusing, but outright ridiculous at times. Saten's habit of flipping Uiharu's skirt, while a part of her personality, comes across as weird for me. It's a quirk, to be sure.\\n\\n\r\nBut most of all, most of the main characters are girls. Now, I'm not sure what this means, but most of the criminals shown are typically males. Girls make up a large part of Judgment and Antiskill and so can punish anyone who disrupts the order of the city. Plus, the \"final boss\" is also female. Railgun, then, gives off that feminist vibe that I can't just ignore.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent and quite generic, but the animation is slightly better when absolutely necessary, particularly during these action scenes. Misaka's status as a Level 5 is not a hyperbole; in fact, she rightfully deserves it, even though she persists in saying that level doesn't matter. One thing I've noticed is that the characters are not shaded whenever they are under the shade of some building or at night time. I actually like them flat-colored rather than with their hair being so shiny with unnecessary white, but that's anime for you. The animation does stagger at times, but not enough to hinder the enjoyment level.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of enjoyment, while I thoroughly enjoyed the story and characters' relationships in reaction to the plot, there were some things that I wish the anime would expand on. For instance, Touma appears but is not involved in any action in the second half as much. What is Misaka's relationship with him? I would assume that he is just a random character tossed in, to please the Index viewers even more. I would have liked an expansion on Touma's ability to block the others' abilities. Maybe that's what Index is for.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Toaru Kagaku no Railgun is good. Nothing far-reaching so as to make this my favorite, nor to have any staying impact on my mind. It is a simple casual and well-told story, with some action and the usual scientific plot mixed in. If you dislike moe (is that the term?), unrealized lesbian relationships, or slice of life, then this might not be for you. Even so, you can skip over them.",

            "content": "~ Justice be done to cease this arms race! ~\r\nA rigid, administrative infrastructure, a reliance on ironically ungodly, god-given superpowers, and the implementation of technologically advanced machines, all for the betterment of its population.  That's the backbone of Academy City. A perfect place for in which future generations, and the future itself, blossoms. Or is it?\r\nUnbeknownst to those who merely glance at the surface of this show, we are in fact looking at an arms race. A widespread hunger for power. Beneath the glistening lights of Railgun's (a shortening for the title) overly \"perfect\" setting, i found this to be a really interesting showthat documents an on-going struggle for power, and a need to bring justice to those who place science above morals... This being the simplified meaning behind this 24 episode series...\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that Railgun did right, it was this above described premise. The actual concept behind the show, though not revolutionary, always appealed to me as particularly interesting, and one of its strong suits. The focus on the somewhat oppressive nature of this society's administration, and the way that everything is valued logically according to the exact details of one's abilities, gave Railgun a very unique, heavily context-based style. It's definitely not bland, and fortunately strays from the \"superpower\" theme stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a somewhat two-faced hybrid between a heavily action-based, cinematic journey, and a more lighthearted SoL. Consequently, there are occasions where the intensity and seriousness of the show, despite being quite emphasized, is a tad jeopardized by the \"reality check\" if you will, that main cast are schoolgirls. But don't run away just yet.\\n\\n\r\nRailgun bears a formidable, overriding story; hidden mostly in the show's early stages. I guess you could say that Railgun's first \"phase\" was made to immerse you and give you a feeling for the premise, and the way in which everything works - a very \"called for\" introduction in my opinion, as like i implied before, without the context it would really work too well. The setting is really immersive and escapist. It gives the viewer a great feel and awareness of scale. Combine this with Railgun's first class art, and it's definitely up there in the visuals department.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of content, Railgun give quite an even split between the characters' lives, and the action-based events that follow. This prevents it from being too sequential, and therefore allows you to go from eating ice cream, to beating up criminals in the blink of an eye. It's great for those with a short attention span, as a generalization, but on a more serious note... Railgun creates a correlation between lack of power, and frustration in its characters, which reflects the context really well. This undertones the main moral arguments that are brought up throughout, and allows surprisingly for more than just shallow emotions to be conveyed, despite the fairly casual presentation. \\n\\n\r\nThere's not an obvious method set to class Railgun as... The characters development techniques are primarily quite documentative and straight-up. It's therefore not too expansive, but makes up for this with dramatic and passionate emotional situations - though they are undermined occasionally due to the comedy/innuendo aspects. (a step too far in my opinion), but considering the identity of the characters again, i guess it's appropriate, despite that perhaps being the only flaw in the setup.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other (arguably slightly larger) side of the spectrum, Railgun is packed to the brim with action-packed situations that are integrated seamlessly, without being consumptive of depth. They're genuinely cool, VERY intense, and suspenseful too - all serving to give a good immediate scope. In-turn this allows the viewer to get a better understanding of everything works, and acts as an outwards reflection, an indicator of how the characters' emotional growth and cooperation allows them to deal justice.\\n\\n\r\nIt CLOSE to being cheesy is Railgun. And i would argue that it is an easy-watching addition to your list, that will have you without a doubt rooting for physics defying schoolgirls. The characters are very understandable, likable, and the action-oriented presentation makes it all particularly cinematic and exhilarating. \\n\\n\r\nRailgun doesn't go without fault though, as i find it frustrating how the meaning evident in the show's brilliant context is not very effectively elaborated upon/conveyed, in the episodes themselves.\\n\r\nSo unfortunately, i would have to say that this really epic name in the anime community, is violated by its identity issues. I feel as though JC crammed a bit too much content into this first season (so yes, i am aware that there's supposed to be room for expansion). By judging holistically, it's quite apparent at least to me that the show tries to appeal to too may different audiences at once, and so its very 2-sided nature conflicts by splitting the \"allocation of depth\", to the point where it's difficult to deduce what the series specializes in.\\n\\n\r\nSo i won't deny that this is a problem that leaves the show slightly lacking in terms of its own personality, and a bit generic... But as a whole, Railgun is nevertheless a very vivid and enjoyable, cinematic series. Based off the awesome context and overriding themes alone alone, i promised myself that would follow the series up with the next season: \"S\". \\n\\n\r\n~ Blue stripes today! ~",

            "content": "Railgun is a spinoff from To aru Majutsu no Index or A certain magical Index\r\nWhile it is a spinoff, a lot of things are different and some people may form biases because of the different feels both anime have. If you disregard the fact that it's a spinoff and consider Railgun as a work of it's own, you can find the things to enjoy.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nRailgun has a few arcs to offer with slice of life-like episodes in between. These episodes however are not completely empty as they are used as tension builders and breakers. As for the arcs, I'll be reviewing them individually\r\nBig spider arc7/10 - This arc shows us a new character named Kurozuma: The Esper Punching machoman. With that being said, this could be considered a filler arc. Nevertheless this arc is still fairly interesting and is not something you would skip as you would something like a Naruto filler.\\n\\n\r\nLevel upper arc 9/10 - Here we get something really interesting, and a major part of the plot. \"Level upper\" sounds like some cheat doesn't it? Well in a way it is, but just like cheating in school, you're just screwing yourself over. Subtle foreshadowing is dropped on us from time to time and tension builds up as the true identity of the stripper lady is revealed as well as her backstory. From the horrifying failed mad scientist experiments to Mikoto failing to realize how Saten felt, we're delivered with the feels quite nicely. This is due to the fact that the tension was built on properly unlike other anime where drama just pops up out of nowhere, and they expect us to feel anything other than being annoyed. Not to forget the cool ability showcasing in this arc.\\n\\n\r\nPoltergeist arc 9/10 - Just when the tension from the previous arc is almost gone, it comes back with even more piled on top of it. We're given a dirtbag character which was designed really well in the way that you just want to punch your screen at the sight of them. Everything is resolved in a somewhat shounen-action anime kind of way, but everything is resolved and concluded properly.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 - personally, I liked the character designs. The animation for sure was not half bad, however. We're given revamped esper animations in comparison to Index (I tried as hard as I could not to compare to Index). The anime was animated pretty well overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 - just as the esper animations were revamped, so were the sounds. There's a \"universal esper sound effect\" in index which was removed and replaced with individual sound effects that, in my opinion, sound much better than that universal schwing. The soundtracks were seemingly perfect for the situations and let's not forget Only my Railgun and Dear my Friend. Two of my favorite songs up to date.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 - We're given a main cast of 4 girls as well as a couple of pretty important support characters who were shown enough of to see their characters. The characters are pretty colorful to say the least and while no mind shattering character development happened, but it's there - from Mikoto being more considerate, to Saten working hard instead of moping.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - Yes that's right. I enjoyed this anime as much as I could. I thought it was executed perfectly but then if I said that it would kill my entire review right? Joking aside, Railgun is like a perfect balance of slice of life, action, and drama and can be pretty easily enjoyed. Don't take my word for it though, check out episode 1 - The hook, which was ACTUALLY executed perfectly\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nThis just says how much I like it. Now go form your own opinion of it! :)",

            "content": "[Since this IS a spin-off of Magical Index and plays in the same universe, I have to compare Railgun to the parent story, so please stick with me here. If you don't know \"A Certain Magical Index I-II\", read my reviews on them. Don't worry, there are no spoilers.]\r\nNot gonna lie, after watching Magical Index, I had doubts about it's spin-off. After all, spin-offs are usually just quick cash grab attempts utilizing fan favorite characters or side-stories and never really amount to anything. The weird thing, however, as I looked around, everyone seemed to praise Railgun to high heavens claiming, that it's way better thanit's parent story. I had to investigate, so I watched it all.\\n\\n\r\nShort opinion: Surprisingly good! Exception to the rule on the spin-off front. I never imagined something like this could grow out of that incoherent mess that's Magical Index, it's truly amazing!\\n\\n\r\nWatching the first few episodes I still had the bad aftertaste Magic Index left me with. Seeing the same Academy City and the same characters reminded me of that nonsensical gibberish the parent story was. But all that passed real quick when the story started to take off a couple of episodes in. First of all, unlike Magical Index, Scientific Railgun has a good story arc. Finally, there is a coherent storyline focusing on the scientific side and ESPers, and none of that magical, religious mumbo-jumbo. Railgun is set before the timeline of Magical Index, it's a standalone story, so don't worry if you haven't seen Magical Index, you are not missing out. Although many of the story elements in Railgun are still need to be taken with mountains of salt and suspension of disbelief, it's an engaging and nicely though out story I never expected from this universe. Well done!\\n\\n\r\nAlso a huge change is in the characters. Instead of introducing tons of throwaway characters to act as one-off plot devices, in Railgun we finally have a core group of main and support characters who stay with us throughout the story. Misaka's character is finally fleshed out and feels alive, an integral part of the story, just like a protagonist should. Toma never managed to get this right, so it seems the writers finally found their calling. Even the support characters have distinct and well-rounded personalities, although some of them still suffer from trope-overload. In all fairness, it's a good bunch of characters and they are relatable, that's what counts.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I have to mention is the art direction. The animation and design quality is obviously way better than Magical Index. It seems they learned a lot since then. The settings, the backdrops and the scenes are way better drawn out and pleasant to look at. There are really no weird angles or \"artistic\" BS, it's cool and collected, really suited for the scientific theme of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some problems and weirdness, however. One thing I noticed is, the story switches between action scenes and exposition with an audible \"CLANG\". The characters eat and drink A LOT. Huge bits of story, explanations and techno-babble are regularly dumped on us by characters sitting on a bench or at a table ALWAYS either having a drink or eating food (or both) and just gushing exposition in the form of dry dialogue. When they are done, it's back to the action, where all the laid out story gets resolved. I don't mean it's a necessarily bad way for a narrative, after all, everything gets explained and shown to the viewer, but it's more than a little weird. I guess the ends justify the means.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, major props for the music. \"Only My Railgun\", the opening, officially made it to my favorite anime music list, but the rest of the tunes from the show are pretty great too. Well done!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the rumors where true, A Certain Scientific Railgun is one damn fine anime with a strong story, strong characters and WAY better than it's parent series. I can only recommend it!",

            "content": "This anime presents the world of To Aru series in a logical way, giving us a glance of the light, comedic daily life of its people as well as some dark, serious things that exist within a particular town.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nIn essence, the story of this anime is nothing amazing. It\u2019s a quite basic one \u2013 MC, as a good person, destroys an evil antagonist in a heavy shounen (or a light seinen) nuance. But the story itself is presented in a logical manner, yet flows like water in a very natural way. Now, i dont talk about the scientific stuffs, but things that happen inthis anime have a proper causality effect \u2013 that\u2019s what i mean by \u201clogical\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gives us a view about the town\u2019s condition in a quite complete way \u2013 althought only in the surface. We are given the idea that this town is a nice place with some, out of place, darkness that linger.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nJC Staff\u2019s people did a great job on the art aspect. The design is usual, but the animation is  smooth. That smooth animation plus the tendency of the characters to move more, successfully please the viewer\u2019s eye. The effects, like the electric and railgun\u2019s trail, are also very well-animated.\\n\\n\r\nThe little details also don\u2019t miss. From rubbles, backgrounds, after-effect of battles etc \u2013 all of them are drawn, quite splendidly at that.\\n\\n\r\nSounds 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds aspect was done in a well manner too. The seiyuus could show the character\u2019s emotion and their charachteristics pretty well. We can roughly guess what kind of person a certain character is, just from hearing how it sounds and the way it speaks several times.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGMs also fit into the atmosphere and amplify the nuance. This gives a proper rise to the emotion of the viewers and made them feel connected to things that is happening in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe most notable thing about the characterization is that each of the character has its own defining characteristic \u2013 from a weak, shallow characteristic to a strong, deep one. That includes the side characters as well which numbers quite a lot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter developments properly exist in this anime. Some are strong and periodically appear, some are weak and just appear once. While the character developments can\u2019t be categorized as very deep ones, it\u2019s more than decent and properly affect the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, i don\u2019t like To Aru series\u2019 world, especially regarding \u201cesper\u201d and \u201cmagic\u201d. I found the idea of the esper in that world as unbalanced. But that was exactly To Aru Kagaku no Railgun gave to me, complete with the causality of the very idea itself. The idea that i hate was presented in a very logical yet natural way \u2013 this what makes i personally can enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was done well and might be enjoyed because of its quality. Some \u201cscientific\u201d things in this anime are absurd, and maybe the jokes too, that\u2019s for sure - but its positive qualities overshadow the negatives.\\n",

That being said, the Railgun series that runs in parallel with Index\u2019s storyline, with several interactions between the two series facilitated through Index\u2019s main protagonist Kamijou Touma. There are some charming characters and intriguing plots in this series, which keeps things interesting and fun, but there is definitely room for improvement here.\r\nProduction quality wise, JC staff does a stellar job of maintaining consistent animation quality, with some notably well animated actions scenes, no doubt from JCStaff\u2019s long time experience with more \u201csuperpowers\u201d based anime adaptations, such as Shakugan no Shana, Zero no Tsukaima, and the counterpart to this series, To Aru Majutsu no Index.\\n\\n\r\nThe main attraction to this show is most certainly the main characters to this series. The main cast, consisting of our main heroine Misaka Mikoto, her roommate Kuroko, \u201cJudgement\u201d member Uiharu, and her class mate Saten, are all charming in their own unique way. Misaka\u2019s tsundere righteous personality may turn some people off, but mostly, she\u2019s a cute and fun character to watch, while Kuroko\u2019s over the top tactics to try and get Misaka to fall in love with her (FYI, Kuroko is a lesbian) is both eyebrow raising yet hilarious. Uiharu and Saten both contribute to the quirkiness of the main cast in their own way, which makes watching the character interactions in this show truly entertaining to watch. Not to mention, the fact that most of the characters in this show have a unique special \u201cpower\u201d, such as the ability to teleport or control electricity, makes the entire cast more diverse and intriguing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some good moments of character development as well, surprisingly with Saten and Uiharu. I feel that they both get the most amount of character development in this series, sometimes subtle and other times more blatant. Although Mikoto is my favorite character to this series, objectively speaking Saten get\u2019s the most amount of character development and complexity to her personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very arc oriented, with the entire series cut up into three or so arcs, with some filler episodes interspersed in between. Quite honestly, in terms of story, I felt that these arcs felt rather weak in terms of plot, with some very shallow villains (with the exception being the female scientist) that made the major conflicts themselves quite boring, even if the action scenes themselves were pretty good. I will admit that there were some battles with some creative usage of the characters\u2019 powers that made them very interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe great part to this series would have to be how all the main characters interact with what is around them, resulting in some hilarious moments between characters such as Touma and Mikoto, or some laugh inducing moments at the sheer fangirlism of Uiharu.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual setting, the author of the original source material did a good job with detailing the setting of the story. The integration of quantum physics ideas, although almost certainly not applicable in the ways it is portrayed in this anime, was a nice touch adding some unique concepts and ideas to this series. Not to mention, the law enforcement groups \u201cJudgement\u201d and \u201cAnti-skill\u201d makes the setting more sensible, yet at the same time, adds a whole different aspect to the entire story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is a fun to watch story with some serious story arcs, with a charming main cast that really gets you into the plot. I definitely feel that some of the filler episodes were unnecessary, but there was a decent amount of character development throughout the show, with a good amount of slice of life moments interspersed in between everything.\\n\\n\r\nProduction Quality: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7.0/10\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nFeedback, comments, and most importantly criticisms, are always welcome :)",

Can't wait for Season 3 on both anime of Index and Railgun!\r\nAlso, of all anime I've watched, this one I liked both opening and ending songs. Usually I'd skip it but here, sometimes I do, sometimes I just listen to it. The characters are great, it's funny and full of humor, it's also action-packed and mixed with both science and magic. Mostly science though. Magic is Index's thing.\r\nGreat story too! The fighting scenes may not be aslong as other anime, like using about 1-4 episode of only one battle. Sometimes it bores me to watch all four episodes only about the fight and a few or couple cuts to show other characters in other locations to make sure the audience isn't bored with watching the continuous fight.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy this overall!",

The series of a certain magical index and a certain scientific railgun take place in the same universe. in fact, in the same town. they intertwine with one another through both series. railgun is more of the light hearted scientific side of the story, while index is more of the dark serious side of magic.  So just because you do not like index, you might like railgun! and vise versa. which i personally liked both! So this story brings up the ancient delima of science vs magic.  what can be proven and what can not. withthat being said...all reviews for this series (i am including index as a part of this series, since they are both so closely related) will be almost identical. however my ranking for both will vary. Also, if you are curious of which series to watch, let me clear that up for you and tell you my personal opinion, which is how the time line goes. \\n\r\n1-a certain scientific railgun\\n\r\n2-a certain magical index\\n\r\n3-a certain scientific railgun s\\n\r\n4-a certain magical index 2\\n\\n\r\nFor this anime\\n\\n\r\nstory-The story is great! i give it a 9 easily for originality, the comedy, and the enjoyment of the story\\n\\n\r\nart-this will get a 10 from me, the art style is amazing and well done\\n\\n\r\nsound-the voice actors for both english and japanese are very well done, so this earns a 10 from me. the music is well placed and sounds good as well!

            "content": "Ow man\u2026This is good. This review will be so nice. So, to be honest, actually I want to make some review for To Aru Kagaku No Railgun S. But when this review was being written, Railgun S was still aired at first episode. Then I better don\u2019t write some text of review for a while at least until this anime reaches ten episodes or more. Because I want to observe some differences between first and second season of these To Aru Series. Basically Railgun (it looks like I should say it \u201cRailgun\u201d since To Aru Kagaku No Railgun is pretty long title isn\u2019t it?) isa spin off story. Spin off is just like side story which tells about detailed other character life story. So it means there\u2019re some main stories that cover all of these characters act. That is To Aru Majutsu No Index. I won\u2019t talk a lot about that because of the differences about the story. Index is a story about magic. In the other hand Railgun is story about science. Something\u2019s like sun and moon eh?  Although Index tells about magical things there\u2019re still a few stories for science. Since the background of both of them is in sophisticated city named Academy City.\\n\\n\r\nAcademy City is issued as the most up-to-date city in science. Almost all of town inhabitant is academic community like student, teacher, lector, professor and scientist of course. One thing that\u2019s really interesting from this city is people can not only study here but also train their special ability. They\u2019re called esper. Every person has a unique ability which is commonly different to the other. The ability is categorized into five stage of level. The range of level is level 1 until level 5. So, the highest one is level 5. There\u2019re only seven persons in Academy city have mastered level 5 and the main character in this story, named Misaka Mikoto, is level 5. Misaka is third year middle schooler. She has ability to control each electric charge around her. It means she can manipulate electricity as she wants. She also can produce it from herself. Electromaster is her title. But she is often called \u2018Tokiwadai\u2019s Railgun\u2019 since she can shoot something with her electromagnetic force and Tokiwadai is the name of her school. Yeah, you know, electromagnetic riffle is already known as railgun. She uses a coin as bullet and that\u2019s her best technique.\\n\\n\r\nMisaka has three close friends who always hanging out with her. First is Kuroko. She is level four and her ability is teleport. She can move something, even herself, into different places in a sec. She is Misaka\u2019s biggest fan. But her adoration at Misaka seems like perverted relationship for me. She often disturbs Misaka when she\u2019s taking a bath. I hope she isn\u2019t lesbian. Kuroko has some weapons which shaped like needle. She usually teleports it into certain point of her targets and then stops their movement. Second is Uiharu. She has been Kuroko friend for a long time ago. And then Kuroko introduces her to Misaka. She\u2019s cute and tiny girl with flower ornament on her head. She\u2019s good in computer things and esper as well. Uiharu and Koroko are member of city\u2019s discipline enforcer named \u201cJudgement\u201d. The last one is general girl named Saten. In this group, she\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t have any special ability. She\u2019s level zero. Or maybe I may say that she hasn\u2019t awoken her ability yet. So she is the real hard worker here because she lacks of skill. She\u2019s Uiharu\u2019s best friend. She often mistreats Uiharu with lifting Uiharu\u2019s skirt and then sees what kind of \u201cpantsu\u201d that she uses today. All of them have a nice friendship. First time Saten met Misaka, she thought Misaka should be an arrogant person since she is the Tokiwadai\u2019s ace. But that\u2019s not true. Misaka is really hospitable person who never differentiates anyone who wants to be her friend. She is humble person as well. They always hang out into caf\u00e9, resto, and other common places that teenagers usually visit.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some important arcs in this anime and it\u2019s never shown in the To Aru Majutsu No Index. The level upper arc. This arc tells about appearance of some methods that can increase esper\u2019s level easily. Basically if espers want to increase their level they must practice hardly at the long periods. It means really difficult to get a level up in your ability. It\u2019s like evolution I think. But this level upper is a cheat. Level upper method is hearing a song. If you hear this song frequently you can gain your level up in the short time without doing a lot of practice. Really easy eh? But a short way always serves a long risk. The fact is this method can\u2019t increase your ability forever. After a certain period, you\u2019ll lose all of your ability even your body will became so numb. Unfortunately Misaka\u2019s friend, Saten, is one of this method\u2019s victims. Saten was tempted to use this song because she thought that she will never gain any level progress. She\u2019s desperate with her efforts.  The culprit behind this accident is a scientist named Kiyama. Uiharu started suspecting her because she\u2019s good in hacking network and analyzing data in computer. Misaka was immediately looking for her to make everything clear. She must account for all of this. But that\u2019s not so fast. Kiyama gains a horrible ability because of this method. She can use all of people\u2019s ability who uses level upper. So she\u2019s a multi-esper now. Misaka had serious battle with her. I can say that\u2019s the finest battle in this anime. You have to see it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the main character of To Aru Majutsu No Index, Kamichou Touma has been appeared in this anime just at several short scenes. He is level zero but he has rare ability which allows him to cancel some energy impact. He had some light battle with Misaka because he pissed her off. Misaka was really surprised when her attack wasn\u2019t working to him. He blocked all of Misaka\u2019s electricity and then ran away from her. Misaka was really angry with his attitude. But I rather say it \u201clike\u201d since she\u2019s \u201ctsundere\u201d after all. Hahaha. I hope it\u2019s true that Misaka\u2019s has a feeling to him because they are really interesting couple.\\n\\n\r\nHere some of my opinions :\\n\r\nPlus :\\n\r\n-Great animation. The battle between Misaka and Kiyama isn\u2019t really bad at all. Although I have watched a lot more superb battle at the other anime, I still can say this one is nice.\\n\\n\r\n-Polite fanservice. I mean it is true that Kuroko is perverted freak. She does a lot of dirty jokes even sexual harassment to Misaka. But overall this is really polite anime. Look at Misaka. She doesn\u2019t have \u201cexaggerated body part\u201d like other general heroine. Just a proper middle schooler. And her short is really good point for her appearance. So there aren\u2019t some \u201cpantsu-jokes\u201d. It\u2019s really rare for anime girl wears short behind her skirt , isn\u2019t it? Haha\u2026 That is Misaka\u2019s trade mark.\\n\\n\r\n-Good execution. Commonly band of girls in anime just do \u201ccute things with cute face\u201d. But there isn\u2019t something like that in Railgun. This Misaka\u2019s gang is a band of girl which always learns together to be a better esper and increase their power properly. Nevertheless Misaka has reached the top of level she\u2019s still trying to enlarge her ability in electro-control. And she\u2019s good tutor for the other.\\n\\n\r\n-Nice moral value. Always believe in your teachers. Because they will always support and save you no matter in how conditions you are. And they will never hesitate to do everything for you. And I think there\u2019s another important moral value which tells about the cruelly of science. Level 5 is the highest but humans still want more. If this cruelty isn\u2019t done well it\u2019ll be disaster for human being.\\n\\n\r\n-Intersting esper. You know, special ability isn\u2019t new issue in action animes and it\u2019s always interesting. I really enjoy when I have to understand each character abilities although they have involute mechanism. How about Kamichou Touma? It is seldom enough for protagonist has ability like that. He can negate some energy impact. Perhaps it means he can also negate Naruto\u2019s Bijuu Dama or Goku\u2019s Genki Dama. Just kidding. For naruto and goku fans don\u2019t take it seriously. With this kind of ability he can form ultimate defend technique that nullifies all of enemy attack. It doesn\u2019t simply make him becomes a godlike hero because Touma\u2019s attacking technique isn\u2019t more than bare hand punch.\\n\\n\r\n-Just a proper ability. I\u2019m sure sometimes you have been tired for super-superb character\u2019s ability in anime. Like ability to destroy the mountain, slice the sea, make huge hole in the land, dismiss the city, etc. Nothing likes that in this anime. It\u2019s true that Misaka can control electricity but she can\u2019t make some exaggerated power like summoning the thunder, manipulating the weather, or maybe shooting the huge cannon light. Then what did you call her railgun? No, that\u2019s not a big deal. Since she only can shot it once as final move and that obviously isn\u2019t mainstream laser cannon thing.\\n\\n\r\nMinus :\\n\r\nIt\u2019ll be so unfair if I give nothing in the minus because I\u2019m the big fans of this anime. So I would like to say if there\u2019re some extra battle scenes, this anime will be perfect. Because I counted there\u2019re just two serious battles during 24 episodes of this anime. I want more. And it\u2019ll be more fun if love story between Touma and Misaka have detailed a lot. Misaka\u2019s tsundere entertain me well. Hehehe\\n\\n\r\nSo, this is my first time I give 9 score for anime in my review. And I don\u2019t doubt to say this is the best spin off story that I ever see.\\n",

            "content": "This is a review of Toaru Kagaku no Railgun and it's sequel, Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S.\r\nThis story follows the daily life of Misaka Mikoto, the 3rd of the 7 level 5s in Academy city, and her friends. \r\nStory :\r\nin Railgun and Railgun S together, there are 4 major arcs. Each arc was built up wonderfully, and the pacing is superb. Every small detail was a plot point in the arc or the next, and supporting characters that appear to be left in the dust in the previous arc are brought back in future episodes. This is probably the anime with the best pacing amongall those that I have watched.\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\r\nThe scenes were animated pretty well, and it does have it amazing moments during battles. Each Railgun that Misaka fires is also animated very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound : \\n\r\nThe soundtracks don't stand out too much, it just is good for what it is. What stands out to me is the opening themes. ALL 4 OF THEM. Each opening theme somehow goes hand in hand with the arc that it is in. You can imagine me enjoying the whole of the last episode of Railgun S where they used 3 out of 4 of the opening themes as background music. It was epic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\r\nEvery character was well developed, and supporting characters are usually never left in the dust. Every character introduced has a purpose, and most of them reappear later on in the show, be it as a major or minor plot point. Most of the characters are likable, and the antagonists are also filled with great personalities, to the point where you empathize with them. But most of the time you find yourself rooting for Misaka.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nAs a sucker for super power shows, I really really enjoyed every bit of this. Not a single episode was wasted in my opinion, and every scene has an importance to future events. I also watched this show BEFORE Toaru Majutsu no Index, and that affected my view on Index because the science side of Academy City was so much more interesting thanks to Railgun. I also started following the novels thanks to this, so obviously I enjoyed this anime very much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Toaru Kagaku no Railgun and Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S a combined score of 10/10",

Such exaggerated facial expressions and voice, it was really disgusting. If you're the type to \"need\" a decent ending then I caution you, everything was really quite great, well balanced, well paced then this villain shows up and it's really just disgusting how it was implemented. The thing with this anime is that it tried to be \"believable\", how it doesn't stray from reality, how it throws bits of science here and there but never to apoint of ridiculousness, that's why when a throwaway shounen villain entered out of left field, it was really just disgusting. If they made the villain bland it would have been better since at the least it would be the plot and the protagonists taking the limelight, but no, they had to overreach right at this crucial point with such an idiotic villain, such a waste. If endings aren't that important to you, then definitely give it a go!",

The success of this anime made me curious with the continuity of his story at each finish watching every episode, the way the author made the puzzle in the story and how to solve it very neatly, coupled with the successful animation excellent battle made me enjoy every episodein this anime.

            "content": "As per usual, I walk into the side story or adaption without any knowledge of the other entries in the franchise. So I had no knowledge of the world or the characters in the beginning. The anime does a good job introducing them though, so I believe I haven't missed anything important.\r\nThe show is arc-based and features two of those, however its structure is somewhat more complicated than you'd expect. Both arcs start off with a bunch of episodes not really connecting to the main plot, featuring side stories, character exploration or good old padding but do get to the point approximately five episodes beforethe climax of the current plot. What surprised me was that most side episodes actually do tie in to the main story in one way or another, the buildup can be felt throughout most of them. An interesting way of telling a story; it has its advantages, most importantly it allows for a deeper exploration of the world (the city, to be more precise) the events are taking place in. And the explanations we get surprisingly bother to actually bring the real world science into it, to a certain extent, of course, but the effort is appreciated. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the main idea, although seen before, is interesting: people now have super powers (let's call things by their names, shall we?), which can have levels from 0 to 5, 0 meaning no powers and 5 meaning Superman levels. Naturally, people with 0 start to envy those with abilities, and this is consistently explored throughout the series. All possible attitudes, from acceptance to frustration and rivalry are featured and talked about, although the correct thing to do is repeatedly stated, which I always dislike, the real world is pretty darn ambiguous. One of the four main characters even has an arc devoted to her dealing with hero 0 level, which is the best character arc in the show, in my opinion (I'll get to that later). Overall, the world this anime is set in felt surprisingly believable, and I have even caught myself thinking of it as a possible precursor to the events and the whole setting of Shinsekai Yori. This idea, however, had a downside of making me compare the treatment of the whole \"powerful and powerless\" relationship problem, which predictably ended in finding Shinsekai Yori far superior. \\n\\n\r\nBut the setting is only as good as are stories and characters existing in it. And both these elements are a mixed bag for me. The plot felt utterly mediocre: while it had a couple of twists and fake outs, it was ultimately predictable, for me at least. There are two major \"villains\", one for each story arc, and the first actually turned out to be pretty identifiable. The character was well-developed, all of the motives were clear and there was even an interesting emotional parallel with Misaka. And the revelation was a good one, I had thought about this but only as of a cool idea, so I was pleasantly, if mildly, surprised. With the second one, however, I really didn't get the idea: the identity of the villain is revealed in what should have been a twist but it had been specifically hinted on several times beforehand, so it wasn't surprising in the slightest. And it still comes completely out of left field, since this person has no significance to any of the leads, there is no connection whatsoever. And as soon as the twist happens, the character goes completely berserk, complete with evil laugh, narrating all of the plans to helpless enemies instead of just killing them, all the boring villain stuff that has been done to death. Same goes for the story arcs themselves: the first one actually was a clever scheme, the second one is just generic, mostly saved by extensive character development. Overall, I liked the first half a lot more storywise.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are the characters, namely the four leads. Misaka, one of the city's most powerful, is mostly your typical high school girl protagonist: bold, good-hearted, if a bit overconfident, which is only natural if you have ultimate control of electromagnetic powers (and she is Electro and Magneto combined in this, which is, simply put, awesome). The stuff with her is what you'd expect: of course she makes mistakes, she can be egotistical at times but comes off as a good person in the end. I had no problems with her. Her roommate Kuroko, however, was ungodly annoying to me. I am dead sick of writers who think that sexual obsession is funny because it goddamn isn't (No Game No Life, for example, tried to bank on it, too; at least it had actual jokes). A lot of time is wasted on her harassing Misaka and the \"hilarious\" wacky antics that are sure to follow. I have never seen it outside of anime, and for a good reason: this won't fly in the real world, you'll just be found creepy and/or crazy. The only funny pervert I have seen PERIOD is Itaru in Stein's Gate but his lines are actual jokes and he wasn't a stalker. And it's a shame, too, because her power of teleportation is actually cool, and she uses it well. She is a policeman of sorts, and you know what? A pretty responsible one, too, she's pretty enjoyable when she actually does something other than harassing Misaka. I couldn't bring myself to like her, sadly.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two are Uiharu, who's a pretty generic girl who gets some development in the second half but is mostly your usual computer expert, and Ruiko, who's by far my favorite. Funny, that, seeing as how she's the one who doesn't have any powers, which makes her a lot more interesting, since it allows for a character study with a focus on her coping with that, which is very well-executed. She's not perfect, she makes mistakes but is still likable; she even gets her moment of glory in the climax. By far the best out of four. The supporting cast is okay for the most part, they have their moments. Some of them are more interesting (the first villain), some of them are pretty cliched and pointless (for example, there's the inevitable high school bitch who is, of course, a good person on the inside). Overall, the cast is enjoyable to watch save for those stupid harassment interactions between Misaka and Kuroko.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is, well, adequate, nice but nothing special. Same goes for the voice acting and music. It never took me out of the experience but it didn't amaze me at any point, either. Which is more or less how the whole anime felt. There are good things in it, I enjoyed watching it for the most part but it wasn't able to really grip me. Shinsekai Yori is partly to be blamed for it, since the same issue of powerful-powerless relationship was discussed much more seriously and deeply there. Overall, it's a good anime, even stuff I didn't really like wasn't all that bad, just mediocre. Except for these stupid interactions with Kuroko.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "While it has already been said by Haak, I feel I need to confess that I greatly prefer Toaru Majutsu no Index to this spinoff series. Therefore, my rating and review are somewhat skewed in that I cannot help but compare this anime to its parent.\r\nThat said, the anime itself is certainly not a bad one. The very world in which the Toaru stories take place is well-founded and makes a perfect host to many potential stories. The sci-fi features and powers are highly attractive in their own right, and the story telling remains top notch. The main flaw in this series that stood outto me personally was, to be honest, the characters. I find that Misaka works significantly better as a side character and romantic interest than she does as a main character- her defining feature is being a tsundere, and without a male counterpart for her to interact with, that facet of her personality is sadly rarely present. Her lesbian friend's antics are fine in moderation, but get tiresome when she has so much screen time. All-in-all, I think the series operates significantly better when centered around Touma and friends than around Kagaku no Railgun's major cast.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, don't take this to mean that I don't think this series is a good watch- it is certainly entertaining, and I think anyone should give it a try. I simply would have enjoyed an earlier release of the second season of Majutsu no Index significantly more, were it up to me.",

            "content": "\u200b\"With great Power comes great Responsibility!\" - Stan Lee\r\nPower is something that every human being has dreamt of having at least once, being it the power of money, strength or simple influence. It is something that helps people change things around them and makes it possible for life to be a lot easier. However, Power does not come without a certain price tag, sticking onto it. With whatever power you obtain, you get the chance to not only change your life but that of others as well. A huge responsibility lies upon the shoulders of those ruling and having the powers that others long forand there are several ways to handle this responsibility and for everyone there are good examples for it. You can simply abuse your power, oppressing everyone that is weaker. You can simply ignore everyone around you and don't care about anyone but yourself. Society though in this age, sees it as the duty of anyone having power to help the ones that have less and speak up for them. Ladies and Gentlemen, todays Anime deals with the issue of obtaining power and having power. Today's topic shall be Index' first Spin-Off To Aru Kagaku no Railgun!\\n\\n\r\nAs this is a Review of both Seasons of Railgun, I am going to give two scores for every category! (One for the original and one for Railgun S)\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nTo Aru Kagaku no Railgun's setting is almost exactly the same as Index'. The Anime takes place in Academic City, a fictional town, that dedicated itself to the advance of science. It has amazing technology and almost 80% of the people living there are students. Most of these,didn't come here for the science aspect though, but for the second big objective that the city was found because of. The training of Espers. Espers, to those who don't know, are people that mysteriously obtained power that they now can use for all kind of things, but for the most time for the sake of fighting. They are split into Levels ranging from 0, which indicates that you have no ability at all, to 5. There are only 7 Level 5 Espers and those are counted as the 7 strongest ones in the whole world. In that city, lives our main character Misaka Mikoto. She is pretty popular Esper, since she is known to be the third strongest Level 5, also known as the \"Railgun\". One day, she gets to know her roommate Kuroko's, a Level 4 Teleporter, acquaintance from her work at Judgment, an organization that focuses on keeping Academic City safe. The acquaintance Uiharu, a Level 1, has always been a huge fan of Misaka and brought her best friend Saten, who doesn't have any powers at all and is of the opinion that probably all Level 5 Espers are arrogant and annoying people. As they meet the \"Railgun\", a friendship quickly develops and the four of them hang out together more and more often. But at the same time, strange incidents start happening everywhere in the city and even though the four at first seem to have nothing to do with it, they get sucked into it faster than they thought they would...\\n\r\nThe Story of Railgun starts of rather weak, presenting a lot of Slice of Life episode to begin with and only a few episodes that really go into the Setting itself. Not to say, that these are bad or anything, it's just not what is to be expected out of a setting that looks this way. After quite some while though, the pacing starts to get faster and more and more incidents start happening. Meanwhile, the show decides to bring in an actual plot. That is to it's better, as the story for Railgun's first season might not be as good as for Index, but it certainly is well done and while there always are a few filler episodes between different arcs, they get back to the actual plot fairly quickly. The strength of the arcs is just as with Index, it's climaxing. When Railgun wants to set it's climax, it gets amazing. Using epic fights great speeches and really well done villains for the sake of ending everything with a big blast.\\n\r\nThe first season's story is while certainly not being bad not as good as Index, the second season blows everything out of the water. Entering the second season, we get to see the sisters arc, a part of the Index show that only had 3 episodes over there, from Misaka's point of view. In Index it was a fairly decent part of the show, but now in Railgun, it gets extended to more than a half of the season and a lot of things get shown that people who watched Index didn't know about. It suddenly shifts into a part that is really dark compared to everything Index has ever done and is what I loved about it. That said the first season did something similar but not to the extent that Railgun S did!\\n\r\nRailgun: 7.7/10\\n\r\nRailgun S: 8.7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:Even though getting amazing at points, the story of Railgun is not what drives the Anime. The strongest point that the Spin-Off has is in it's characters. Other than it's predecessor, this show uses it's characters a lot more and is working towards their development. While Index often only used them as a plot device, Railgun rather uses both parts to bring each other further. The story advances the characters and the characters advance the story. We have our main protagonist Misaka Mikoto, aka the \"Railgun\". She is a pretty popular Esper, as she is listed as the third strongest Level 5 in the world. Still, she stays really levelheaded and often doesn't really think that her powers are anything to show off with, but rather sees them as a practical tool. That's what makes her friendship with the other three characters possible. Nonetheless, she is a really strong woman in total while caring for everyone around her. Caring this much for people, often makes her vulnerable though, since she never wants anyone around her to get involved into things happening around her. The next character is Misaka's roommate Shirai Kuroko. Kuroko is a Level 4 Teleporter that is (at least it gets strongly hinted) sexually attracted to Misaka. She has a rather bold personality and is the one that the most comedy relief comes from, mostly using her tries to get close to her roommate. She can get really serious at times, though most of the time being when it is about her work at Judgment, an organization that keeps the streets of Academic City in order. Next up is her Judgment Colleague Uiharu Kazaro. Uiharu is a really quite and kind girl. She is Kuroko's team partner in Judgment, but she normally only sits at their base though, as she is really good with computers. The last one is Saten Ruiko. She is an energetic girl, that has a unique fascination for urban rumors and is Uiharu's best friend. She is a Level 0, meaning that she has no power at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters in Railgun are pretty much the same as for Index. While all being fairly interesting to watch, they often lack a little depth and character development. They are all given background and motivation, but they don't seem to stand out as much as they used to in the first instance of the franchise. That is not due to them being bad though, but due to us now having strong lead characters. For Index, the main characters were really generic and didn't have any interesting characteristics. This made the characters shine, since they were a lot better written than Touma and Index themselves. For Railgun, this is not the case. In Railgun, the main characters are really well done, making the side characters only remain in their shadows and not seem as amazing as they were in Index. They still are quite good though.\\n\r\nThe characters in Railgun are a lot better as in Index, as Railgun focuses a lot more on them than it's parent story does. It is able to let them grow on you really fast and manages to capture their mentalities really well! This can be seen best, whenever the show enters a darker part of the story, such as middle parts of the Level-Upper incident and the Sisters Arc. They are in no way one-dimensional and everyone has a believable and likeable side to him. Heck, even the villains in the end often turn out to either be pretty cool or just amazingly well written for the most part. There aren't quite as many side characters in Railgun as there were in Index, but the amount of them still is pretty high compared to other shows. They all are well written though and almost none of them is boring.\\n\r\nRailgun: 8.5/10\\n\r\nRailgun S: 9.1/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe Art in Railgun's first season is pretty good. As expected from J.C. Staff, the animation is pretty well done, while not being outstanding. It is detailed and fluent during the action scenes, but is kept to a rather standard level in the Slice of Life parts. The use of CG-Animation is quite obvious though, as it does stand out quite a bit and does not look good! This gets really annoying, when they start doing the background purely based on CGI. For the second season, the standards of Animation rises quite a bit, as there were several years of a gap between the production of the two shows. The Animation does get more fluent and even though it doesn't get any more detailed it doesn't need to. However compared to other shows of it's time, both are only above average and could've been better. One plus point for Railgun S though is, that they use a lot less CGI than any other Raildex show. The character designs don't look too original, but are nothing to complain about, since they for the most part are bound to the original show. However the ones that are new aren't too original either.\\n\r\nRailgun: 7.5/10\\n\r\nRailgun S: 7.7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nRailgun's Soundtrack was done by Maiko Iuchi, who is part of the company \"I've\", that did the OST for Index. He also did the Soundtrack for Ano Natsu de Matteru. The Music in Railgun is really good, having a great variety of tracks, ranging from energetic electronic music for the fight scenes, light hearted tracks for the Slice of Life parts and quite piano OSTs for the sad scenes. It suits the show really well and is really good to get you either hyped up or breaking to the ground. Of course it is not something that a Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown) would have created, but it does it's job. Even outside the Anime, the OST still has an impact, as it is a lot of fun to listen to even while not watching the show. That is an attribute, that makes an amazing OST. The only part that I don't like about it are just as in Index the light hearted tracks, that often annoy the hell out of me. They are fine when not being noticed or really quite, but they don't really sound good to me. The Openings on the other hand are amazing. All four of them capture the show really well and are able to get you hyped for the show itself. The songs are amazing and I've been listening to them on my phone all day long. As for now, there is no dub available and the Japanese voice acting is as always really good (I can't judge too much though since my Japanese is not good enough).\\n\r\nRailgun: 7,9/10\\n\r\nRailgun S: 7,8/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite being part of the same franchise and even being set in the same city as Index, the themes presented in the two Raildex instances are entirely different. While the parent story focuses more on the war between church and science, the church doesn't play any roll in the spin-off. Instead, Railgun is more about Power, how to obtain it and what to do with it. It deals with the lack of power and how the wish of having it can effect people and it deals with the responsibility of having a lot of power and how it can effect people's life. It does so amazingly well, presenting it in the characters in a great way and never disappoints in good and flashy action. The story and setting both are really interesting and both seasons of it are great.\\n\r\nNow as I calculated the scores I gave to To Aru Kagaku no Railgun and To Aru Kagaku no Railgun S (being Story, Characters, Art, Sound and my personal enjoyment) I got to a score of 8.02/10 for Railgun and a score of 8.52/10 for Railgun S. The first season already is good mostly for it's characters, but the second season then proceeds to get lengths better and is simply amazing. As it stands now, both Seasons are currently unlicensed and is available for legal streaming on Crunchyroll.\\n\r\nAnd with that, I hoped you enjoyed this Review and until the next post!\\n\\n\r\nFollow me on Twitter: @korigaming ; Hummingbird: Kori\\n\r\nDon't forget to subscribe and like this post!",

And the stories main antagonists are usually bringing the city near Dystruction for the sake of selfish ambitions.\r\nBut like any good 'superhero' story, the heroes attempt to stop them, and bring everything back to peace.\r\nI like to keep my reviews short, so I'll end with the relation to 'Toaru Majutsu no Index', which is a Same Setting story, that happens prior-to, and possibly during, the events of Railgun.  Railgun's story has more impact on theactual City.  And the story is more about the City itself, while Index was more character oriented.  The events of Railgun were more socialized is how I would put it, compared to Index's privatized story.\\n\r\nWhich creates a good relation between the two anime, in my opinion.",

            "content": "There is a lot to like in this anime, but I feel that it doesn't make the most of it. For instance, the anime starts out with a couple of episodes that are laugh out loud funny. As the series progresses, it stops being funny or at least as funny and as often. At the climaxes halfway and at the end, there are a couple of great fight scene featuring the protagonist. Yet these fight's are absent much of the second half of the series in favor of short stories featuring minor characters. Many people in the city have cool and interesting super powers. Yetthe show only shows you the powers of a fraction of the people who have them and makes many people have week powers. This leaves the watcher with a lot on short arcs that focus on character development. The character's are likable and the messages are sweet, but that's not exactly what I'm here for. Overall, it's an anime who enjoyment varies from arc to arc and which is occasional outstanding and hints at being more consistently so.",

As an allegory of Japanese youth's angst over post-middle-school stratification, it's literal visualization of a hopeless future is both enthralling and downright frightening.\r\nThe second half of the season builds gradually, piece by piece, as the show seems content to tell the tangential backstory of whatever tertiary character has shown up to that point.  But when the climax comes, the show's patience (as your's) is rewarded with anexciting and emotional finish.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also poses the question of how many times you care to see a fourteen year-old girl smoke some fools with lightning from her finger.

            "content": "I was introduced to this anime by a quiz comparing Asuka from Neon Genesis and Mikoto from Railgun. A lot of people said that they liked Mikoto better so I decided why not check it out. This anime looks kind of cute. \r\nIt's a shame that the series had a lot of potential and I really wanted to enjoy it, but the writing and characters needed work and there are parts where the drama just doesn't work.  This has some of the worst writing I have ever seen. There is not much interesting characters to be found here, they're all pretty archetypal and overwritten.\r\nRailguncould've been put in my favorites had it not disappointed me the way it did. I liked the concept behind it but it wasn't executed very well.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nMikoto is a young girl who has been training to be an esper since she was like seven. Now, she has incredible electricity powers and along with her friends, Kuroko, a lesbian girl, Saten, an angsty girl, and Uiharu, a bashful girl must battle off monsters, espers, and bullying men that come their way.\\n\r\nThe characters are all archetypes of other anime characters and there is nothing too special about them. They are unoriginal cliches. I am actually quite in disbelief of what J.C. Staff has come to. They gave me Azumanga Daioh and now this? What actually has anime come to?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThere are some complexity to the series and a lot of character development, but I still did not care much for the characters as their fight scenes were pretty lame and they can change from acting in-character to out of character. The dialogue is not obvious but it's weird. The only good thing about them is that I can empathize with the protagonist and there are some funny moments but they can also be annoying and unlikeable.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe shows' songs are too relaxing for this series' tone. And what I mean by that is that there is a lot of slow and emotional songs and are not totally fitting. The show has a friendly atmosphere so they may sound nice at first but then they start to get worse hearing them over and over again. Overall, not repeatable songs. Except for the opening and ending songs, the intensity in them fits the action of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow the voice acting compared to the dub was less whiny, though Kuroko's voice sounded too sarcastic and snarky but otherwise deep and strong. But I love that stripper woman's sexy voice! The skill put into it was imaginative. And the director for the voice actors and the series itself was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nBut the writing, ugh, the characterization was stupid and it had one of the most uninteresting writing in anime. This show was quite annoying to sit through and at one episode, it made me want to flip the table. It is so mundane and it is not for people looking for very creative work. Also, that OP for the second half made me want to scream.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a pretty bad series. Do not watch.",

            "content": "Note: This is a review for the entire series (both seasons)\r\nJ.C. Staff (yes, THEM) did a great job with the Railgun series and created a very complementary side story to A Certain Magical Index which I think surpasses the original (particularly the second season, Railgun S). Mikoto Misaka aka \"Biribiri\" is one of my favorite anime characters and Railgun gets her front and center in the action, which is never a bad thing. I watched the first season of Index before this and I think that is the best way to truly enjoy this series. Railgun can definitely be watched without seeing Index first, butall the Touma (he is such a boss in Railgun vs in Index) cameos (and other characters allegedly) really lose their impact. And while Index was purely an action shounen, Railgun is more of a girly slice-of-life where the chicks also kick ass during their time off. This is particularly true of the first season which is about 50% SOL episodes. The second season is beyond epic and there are only a few fillers there.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest strength of this series is without a doubt the protagonist, Misaka. I love her. There is so much to her than just a tsundere with unspeakable esper powers. But it isn't until the second season, where her character really gets a chance to develop and go through some truly difficult hardships. Shirai is hilarious with her yuri love for Misaka and Uihara and Saten are there to be cute adding to the girly SOL part of this series. I wish that there was more Touma in Railgun (like in every single episode) but when he does appear, he comes off so much better than he does in Index (so much less preachy). The action scenes are animated very well and give us a great variety of esper powers especially in the second season. The soundtrack for Railgun is fantastic filled with great BGM tracks. I loved the OPs and EDs from both seasons (especially Dear My Friend and sisters noise).\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, the first season of Railgun is much heavier on the girly SOL. I didn't mind this that much but there were a few too filler episodes for my tastes. However, the second season of Railgun is epic and really cuts down on the filler. The first 16 episodes of season 2 cover the \"Sisters\" Arc which is hands down the best arc of the Raildex series and J.C. Staff knocked it out of the park. Even though Index covered it for a few episodes in the first season from Touma's perspective, Railgun really delves into everything Misaka had to go through especially her suffering and depression. I absolutely loved every moment of it, in particular the final battle, even though I kind of knew what was coming. The final arc is not as good, but I'll let it slide since the \"Sisters\" arc was so epic. So, I'd give the first season a 7/10 and the second season an 8/10 (a 9/10 for the Sisters Arc).\\n\\n\r\nIf you've watched Index at all, Railgun is a must see if you liked Misaka in any capacity. One can never get enough of Biribiri. It is definitely a step up in quality from the Index series. And you don't have to watch Index before this (or at all) in order to enjoy Railgun but it definitely helps. Anyway, if you like watching girls doing girly things and kicking ass with crazy esper powers, this is the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10",

            "content": "It's not perfect, but this spinoff to A Certain Magical Index is at least a major improvement over Index. Unlike Index, Railgun maintains a consistent narrative focus on its look into the everyday life of Mikoto and her friends within Academy City, making it a more character-driven work as a result. To a good extent, this series dabbles into slice-of-life comedy-drama in its focus on Mikoto and pals focusing on the comical quirks and developments that the girls go through such as Mikoto learning to be more dependent on her friends to aid in overcoming a problem and Saten overcoming her insecurities of lacking esperpower. The Level Upper arc offers the best developments for this season of the series with the girls dealing with differing issues affecting those close to them and parts of the city populace, hinting that the upper levels of Academy City's society may not be as good as the public perceive.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does, however, suffer from some pretty major flaws though, the biggest being that it dabbles fairly heavily in filler. Episodes not focusing on a major issue serve either to provide more depth on certain characters or are comical fodder focused on the quirks of the characters. While the former has meaning, the latter is a complete waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nOther issues that hurt the quality of the series include Kuroko's character and the title's final arc. Kuroko plays the role of obsessive lesbian who lusts for Mikoto and makes failed efforts to have her way with the title's main heroine. This makes her character rather obnoxious at many points whenever this aspect of her character is exploited for failed attempts at comedy. The final arc of the series is the weakest of the series due to having a major foe depicted as your archetypal crazy loon when they reveal their true nature and having some rather sloppy narrative moments with how said baddie failed to defeat the girls at several points in the arc. Plus despite whatever hints the anime drops regarding Academy City's corrupt underbelly, this series lacks a resolution as the series continues on with Railgun S.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, Railgun maintains the high quality presentation of Index with vivid colors, nicely detailed scenery and character designs, and fluid movements from characters during action scenes and mundane moments. The soundtrack consists of upbeat, energetic tracks with some J-pop implemented for the OP and ED sequences. Some of the songs were pleasant on the ears like Dear my Friend, but not much stuck out for me.\\n\\n\r\nWhile carrying some major issues, Railgun's more character-driven focus does make it somewhat better to see than Index's jumbled up plot arcs and questionable character focus. It's a rare case for me of the spinoff being better in quality than the main continuity of the franchise.",

            "content": "First of all this is a rather short review for those who don't like to read long reviews.\r\nSTORY (7/10): The whole story of \"Toaru Kagaku no Railgun\" itself is pretty decent becasue the arcs are actually connected to each other, which gives a littel extra thrill, but it develops so slow and is interrupted with so many filler like slice of life episodes and scenes. This leads to an underdeveloped plot. Despite all that the story gives you better understanding of the \"Toaru Majutsu no Index/Toaru Kagaku no Railgun - universe\" and expands it.\r\nART (9/10): The animation is very consistent and fluently. The character designsis kept realistic but still not too general. The art style is nothing innovative though, but it is totally fine the way it is.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6/10): The soundtracks are nothing special at all. They are merely running in the background and add some feeling. The voice actors are doing a decent job and Kuroko's voice is a really amazing choice. Absolutely cliched are the openings and endings since they are mostly a typical techno beat and typical singing., but if you like this kind of music you will enjoy them.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (6/10): The characters are nothing too special but they aren't too plain either, except for Kuroko. You don't see a character like her often.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (5/10): The anime is most of the time boring to watch because of all the unneccessary scenes and episodes\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (6/10): \"Toaru Kagaku no Railgun\" had very good potential, but failed in the execution. Nevertheless it is a very good spin-off and a recommendation if you are a fan \"Toaru Majutsu no Index\".",

Am I saying that quality of anime has stagnated, or that Railgun is beautiful? Both, but mainly the latter. It looks good enough, but it won't break that 17 point barrier because it's not KyoAni levels of eyegasm at every turn. Maybe I come off as a bit too harsh here since it is from 2010, but as I am grading it in 2018 I have to take off the rose-tinted glasses and judge it without bias. All in all, Railgun'sart style has managed to stand the test of time.\\n\\n\r\n-Animation: 15/20\\n\\n\r\nIt's nothing spectacular, but it's also not terrible. Doesn't feel like all of the studio's budget went into the animation but it's not shoddy work. The frame rate matches the action and I don't feel like I'm watching a Michael Bay film where I find it hard to keep up with the action going on the screen (this is bad). Once again, for a 2009/2010 show it's admirable that it can compare with the quality of 2018.\\n\\n\r\n-Storyline: 18/20\\n\\n\r\nI stumbled across Index, and by extension, Railgun in early 2015. I skipped past it since I wasn't interested in 2 cour shows at the time. Coming back 3 years later, I came across a post talking about \"A sci-fi/fantasy series with an amazing universe, great characters, and interesting arcs and overall story as well as a fun premise: The Toaru Series\". That post singlehandedly convinced me to start watching Railgun and explore the Toaru universe after watching Index from a while back.\\n\\n\r\nWas it worth my time?\\n\\n\r\nYes.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to Index where their MC, Touma, can quite literally defeat most baddies with the use of his fist (or palm?), Railgun's MC, Misaka, is more innovative in taking down her opponents. Yes, she does use some of the same attacks but the Railgun is not the \"one-size-fits-all\" attack that you might think it to be. Some of her interactions with the environment are intriguing and Touma's One-Punch Man route pales in comparison to Misaka's. Railgun manages to keep us suspending our belief through clever use of how their esper abilities work and though some are left unexplained temporarily, they always come back and close the plot holes back up. That's not to say that their story is water-tight, but it is good enough for a simple man like me.\\n\\n\r\nRailgun also raises some thought-provoking ideas. Some of the shorter ones such as \"Does the good done in the name of science outweigh the evil?\" can be near impossible to ever come up with a concise answer to, yet Railgun bravely takes on that challenge with the simple but heartening approach of \"No, but the power of friendship can help achieve good without the evil!...\"\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say that Railgun dilutes such ideas to child's play or otherwise; but it is interesting to see how science interacts with morality in this fictional setting.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters: They feel like people. Having 2-dimensional drawings on screen makes it hard enough to envision it, but they act like and talk like human beings, which is a big compliment. Maybe it's the 2 cour magic that allows for each character to have a character arc, and even then it's not like other characters are shafted when it's not their turn, unlike some To Love-Ru girls. Misaka, Shirai, Saten and Uihara put the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to shame when it comes to the conversations between them and the chemistry they have. Though Misaka is mostly independent (as she should be, being powerful and all), she can still be seen relying on them up till the very end, even if only for moral support. One complaint I do have is that I don't like unnecessarily high-pitched voices which Shirai sadly has, but I couldn't imagine her with any other voice after hearing her.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the setting: I like school settings as much as anyone else would, but certainly after so many shows it's gotten a bit stale. Railgun (and Index) changes that with Academy City: A place where most of the inhabitants are students, it might as well be a school of its own. This allows for the backgrounds to be more vibrant rather than your typical window-loving, sitting-at-the-back-of-the-class view that everyone is already familiar with. Academy City isn't lush with greenery though; it's filled with tall buildings of the same grey-ish, white-ish hue as you'd expect of a metropolitan city, with the odd park here and there. Yet, that's just the city central. Go to the outskirts and you'll feel just at home in Compton where the thugs roam. This allows for Railgun (and Index) to feel like a much bigger place rather than the school, sidewalk, convenience store and home environments that I've been desensitised to. It's a nice change of pace and a breath of fresh air that some anime lack. Not this one.\\n\\n\r\nThere was also some filler beach episode in between, but it came right after the first big arc so I don't blame them for toning it down a bit before the next arc.\\n\\n\r\n-Music: 19/20\\n\\n\r\nAh, the music. Even before watching Railgun, I've spent countless hours jamming to the OPs and it just gives you energy. Music for me, does this thing where it can make a shit show become average, but also can make a good show even greater. fripSide did a good job with both OPs but I can't say I'm a fan of ELISA's EDs.\\n\\n\r\nSound design was also pretty good, and I hadn't noticed this until further peer evaluation. It's something like the bassist - you don't realise it's there until it's actually not there.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 18/20\\n\\n\r\nI covered it once in 'Storyline' above, but I'll say it again explicitly: I enjoyed Toaru Kagaku no Railgun. It doesn't leave you on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode, but the main cast and universe just keep you interested in what else the show has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nI'm excited for the Season 2 that I'll watch after this, and I hope it doesn't let me down.\\n\\n",

The characters were made so well for each other. One of the anime's out there that managed to really suck me into the story for the whole series (every episode). It isn't that long too which makes it so powerful for its short length. \r\nDefinitely worth watching this anime. I've watched it about 8 times already .......",

            "content": "Well, I just got through with this anime this evening as it happens, so I thought I'd write my first review about it. I should also say I haven't see the original Index series of which this is a spin off. \r\nSo this anime is about Misaka, the 'Railgun' (a nickname given to her because of her power over electricity) and her friends in a student city full of espers. It's a serious anime generally with plenty of comedy moments.\r\nBefore I go on, I can say now that the quality of the animation and sound are both good. I guess we can thank the peopleat JC Staff for this, and all credit to them. Certainly it doesn't have a cheap visual feel to it, and there are certain scenes (particularly towards the middle of the show) that I found to be pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nStill, let's get to the meat of the review - the writing. The writers had a lot to work with potentially here - you could really have any person with any power and they could be justified as existing in this setting. Obviously I'm not going to go into too much detail of the specifics, but I would say the writers attended a course on foreshadowing and plot convenience before setting to the task of writing this. There were several times in the show were something was considered a rumour at the start of a conversation, and then all but taken as truth by the end of that conversation with no reasoning for the jump given. In fact almost all (if not entirely all) rumours come to pass in this show - I for one should not like to be the victim of gossip in such a world. Let's put it like this - if it's speculated by a character, the chances are it's going to come to pass. This does leave one with a taste of unrealism after many episodes, but I'm sure most people will be able to get past it.\\n\\n\r\nTo what extent is this an 'off the shelf mix'. That is to say, writers have taken characters and stories from elsewhere and bolted them together? Well I don't watch a huge amount of anime these days, but it does have that sort of feel to it at times. Certainly the yuri undertones (and, often, overtones) wouldn't help in the defense of this point. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose the main question you have to consider when writing a review is simply whether you enjoyed it or not. I have been quite harsh on this show because I feel like they could have done so much more with it. But then I suppose to have made it complicated to a level that satisfied me may have been to cut out the younger audience. Still, I feel it's a fair point. There were times when I cringed or sighed at a character's reaction or the convenience of how a plot was discovered, or how the bad guy gave away the plan when they felt most confident. For all this though, I did enjoy it. It was a non-too complex pleasure which was, for the most part, entertaining and amusing. Be careful after the completion of the first story arc (basically the first half of the show), because after that there are a few quite dreary episodes until the second plot arc picks up.\\n\\n\r\nSo good and perfectly watchable. Just don't expect anything too original from this one.",
