            "content": "This is the first anime that I watched that was written by Mitsuru Adachi. I love baseball  anime so I give this one a chance, I never thought that I'll love it so much~ :D Just finished re-watching it for the third time.\r\nStory:\r\n\tHonestly, i was blown away by the first episode, what a very strong start for an anime. It  was all unexpected, Just the first episode and it already made me cry... The story was about the cat  and dog relationship of Kou and Aoba. Adachi-sensei used his usual pattern of story, the childhood friend route. With a lot of twist, surprise event and a roller coaster of emotion that you will like. We have comedy, romance, drama, Baseball action in one place. \\n\\n\r\n\tFirst, let\u2019s discuss comedy, Adachi-sensei never missed any opportunity to crack a joke, the very important thing about delivering a joke was the Timing and that was done perfectly. He will  happily use anyone or anything (old or new) as a punch line, so even its just an ordinary day you will find it funny and interesting. Next is Romance, the romance in the story isn\u2019t  rushed, you can see it develop little by little, with love triangle in every corner makes it interesting  so you can enjoy the love and hate relationship of the two protagonist until the end~. Drama, when Adachi-sensei put a drama in his work it become the key point of the story, just like what happened in the first episode, it will leave an impression until the end of story. Baseball action, Maybe because Adachi-sensei have his own baseball team that he can deliver such an exciting baseball game. He knows When and how to make incredible events to happen, totally surprising, that's why I love the baseball manga the he writes. \\n\\n\r\n\tAnother key point of the story is memories~ Every now and then you'll see a flashback in the story, well I didn't find it annoying, it plays a major role in the character development of the main characters. Sometimes those memories makes me teary.Ending, I'm somewhat contented with it, all the feelings was sorted out and finished the climax of the waited battle in the baseball tournament. Somewhat because i wish he continued it until koushien XD\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n\tIf u already read some of Adachi-sensei's manga you will find that all of his male protagonist has the same kind of character and i think same goes for the female. This time its Kitamura Kou, only son, cant even play catch ball till 5th grade, hard working and good at lying. The Ace Pitcher of the Seishu Academy, a typical character that you will like. Tsukishima Wakaba, same age, birthday and birthplace as Kou and love him more than anyone else. She plays a major role in the story despite of her status. Tsukishima Aoba, wakaba's little sister, who hates Kou very much and love Wakaba. If there's a word to describe her its \"Tsundere\". Kou's teacher about pitching. Very talented in Baseball despite of being a girl. Akaishi Osamu, position catcher, 5th batter and later the Captain of the Seishu baseball team. Like Kou he loves Wakaba too. Azuma Yuuhei, 1st base and the 4th batter and a talented one. He first appeared as an antagonist. He's emotionless when talking and only shows different emotion when playing baseball. Takigawa Akane, I'm really surprised of her appearance in the story, almost jaw dropping. The girl that moved next door and the daughter of the Soba Restaurant owner and a great painter. Her appearance takes the story to a new height.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\t\\n\r\n\tHere's another trademark of Adachi-sensei. Imagine a classic drawing and add modern day coloring and you will get a remastered feeling. His character design is all the same, specially the ears and the hair color were black, blond and brown. Same goes for the character faces, i had read in one of his manga that even Adachi-sensei criticize his own work for having the same face design for some character. Overall, the classic animation style that used in this anime was some-what refreshing if you want to escape the modern day animation style.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n\tThe Opening song \"Summer Rain\" really suits the anime, it gives the listener a tropical kind of beat, maybe because of the guitar. Good thing that they didn't replace it until the end of the series. The Ending song Koi Kogarete Mita Yume fit  perfectly to the 1st quarter of the season~ that slow and sad song can easily make u cry if added in the scene specially in the 1st episode~ The 2nd one is Orange Days, a Rap song, IMO it doesn't fit the anime, its not like the song is bad or anything, just that using a song like that in an anime with a classic style of animation isnt good. The 3rd  Moeru You na Koi Janai Kedo got a nice beat and  slow rhythm . And the last ED song is Rehersal, one of my favorite song. The piano is great and the lyrics too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n\tI really enjoy Cross Game. I laugh on the jabs, cries in the sad and touchy scenes and get caught in the suspense and excitement of baseball action. that you will ask for more. Well if you Want more baseball action, read H2 and Touch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 9/10\r\nCross Game is my first Adachi anime, and I was thoroughly impressed by its storytelling. The whole series is slow paced and filled with tension. Despite being somewhat predictable, Cross Game is well executed. There is only 1 filler episode out of 50, and even that episode tied pretty well into the main story. My only criticism is Adachi could have fleshed it out a little more, adding some more episodes. Yes this show already has 50 episodes, but it feels shorter than that.\r\nAnimation: 8/10\r\nI really liked the art from this show. It feels like an old school anime, and the nostalgic atmosphere itcreates serves it well. There were a few points in the show where the animation quality dipped. However, the no non-sense/frills animation was pretty consistent throughout its entirety.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nCross Game\u2019s cast is one of the most memorable in all of anime (that I have watched at least). Each character is developed so well that there isn\u2019t really a character that you won\u2019t like. In fact, you will really sympathize with the main cast\u2019s struggles, hardships, and triumphs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI loved the OP and the first ED. The next few ED\u2019s are great, but not as powerfully moving as the first one. The first ED \u201cKoi Kogarete Mita Yume\u201d is a beautiful song in its own right, but coupled with this anime, it really could not be more perfect. The OP \u201cSummer Rain\u201d is another song that really speaks volumes about the show and instantly feels like a classic. Finally the soundtrack is wonderfully arranged and really adds to the tension/excitement of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI\u2019m not really a big fan of baseball and when I started this show I was a little hesitant, but I had heard great things about it. From the start, the show hooked me in and never dropped the ball. Easily one of the best slice of life shows I\u2019ve seen (one of the best anime\u2019s I\u2019ve seen for that matter), so I highly recommend this show to others. If you can get past its animation (for some, that\u2019s the weakest part of the show), you will be rewarded with a classic.\\n\\n\r\nAverage Series Rating: 9.4 - Classic\\n",

            "content": "\u201cSimple is best.\u201d\r\n-Coach Maeno\r\nOne of the most common misconceptions viewers have regarding any form of media is something I call the \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d phenomenon. That is, if something similar has been done before, chances are the viewer will form a set of judgmental comparisons and criteria to be matched. This leads to the unrealistic expectation that equates to the viewer expecting some sort of literary revolution, only looking forward without truly embracing what the present has to offer. Adachi Mitsuru\u2019s Cross Game accepts its genre boundaries, and relies on the deftness of its storytelling and the depth of its characterization to keep youwanting more. \\n\\n\r\nKitamura Ko is the only son of Kitamura Sports Shop, whose apathetic nature belies his immense potential as a baseball player. Living down the street from Tsukishima Batting Center, home to its four sisters, Ko\u2019s family has formed a long-lasting relationship with the Tsukishima\u2019s. This bond is strengthened by the fated pair, Ko and the Tsukishima\u2019s second oldest, Wakaba, both being born on the same day in the same hospital. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost immediately, Adachi throws a tragic curveball to the viewer, to which he first displays his skillful handling of his story. With such heavy dramatic potential in just the first episode alone, Adachi carefully utilizes this opportunity to not throw away his setup in favor of melodrama, but instead capitalize on creating a human connection between the characters and the viewers. This connection cements the foundation for a strong cast of personalities, led by Ko and the Tsukishima\u2019s third sister, Aoba. \\n\\n\r\nThe two protagonists are startlingly similar, and Adachi builds the pair up like two halves of a perfect whole. Despite Aoba\u2019s generally spiteful attitude towards Ko and his reluctant acceptance of her continual ridicule, the exchanges between the two do not detract from their development, but instead define its progression. Additionally, a further romantic element is introduced, which adds a dramatic tone that quickens the story\u2019s pacing towards their lives in Seishu High School and their dreams of aiming for Koshien, while introducing human complexities and relationships that are surprisingly, never overdramatized. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, to assume the depth of characterization stops with the protagonists would be a major mistake. Perhaps the most interesting character besides the leading pair is Akaishi Osamu, a childhood friend to Ko. Eventually named team captain to Seishu\u2019s baseball team, Akaishi\u2019s personality and decisions throughout the series draw a heavy emotional connection not expected of side characters, especially in sports anime that typically focus only on the protagonists. A whole slew of other characters are also given some time to shine, from Seishu\u2019s cleanup hitter, Azuma Yuhei, to the team\u2019s former manager, Shidou Risa. Each character opts to stay true to who they are, while developing as a result of the progression of the story. Adachi embraces the notion that people never completely change who they are, but they do make adjustments to make better of their lives. \\n\\n\r\nOutside of the drama and relationships is a generally lighthearted dialogue that surrounds a rather typical formula to get to Koshien, Japan\u2019s High School baseball championship. The progression of Seishu\u2019s baseball team and Aoba\u2019s struggle to continue baseball despite not being able to participate in official games become key plot points that seamlessly intertwine with consistent character interaction defined by Adachi\u2019s keen sense of humor. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of humor, jokes are masterfully timed and clever, despite seeming clich\u00e9 from time to time. The juxtaposition of the serious and the blithe is a tone not seen pulled off correctly too often in anime, but Cross Game is able to nail it almost every time, making sure each joke is cracked just the right number of times and at the right time too. However, the frivolity of their banter is not wasted either. Even the lightest of jokes serves a purpose to further an emotional connection between the character and the audience, and as the series progresses, the viewer will find him or herself laughing or crying along with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the actual baseball in the series, there is definitely plenty of it, and the games are done very well. One does not have to be a fan of baseball to simply enjoy the timely suspense of a close game, and unlike most other sports anime, the series doesn\u2019t sell out on creating unrealistic situations or miracle comebacks to keep the viewer at the edge of her seat. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of Cross Game is slow for a sports anime, but well-executed. The three major twists in the series are timed perfectly, which adds a sense of believability, for coincidences in life do occur, but not constantly. While relationships between characters may seem to grow complex, the foundation of the series remains rather simple and true to itself. For this series to be labeled as a \u201cdrama\u201d is definitely justified, but a bit of an overstatement. It carries many slice of life elements and ultimately is a feel-good experience, but the sheer variety of what it has to offer extends beyond a simple genre label.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that\u2019s not to say that the series is flaw-free either. With a decent amount of characters spanning 50 episodes, one can\u2019t help but to ask for just a bit more from a few more characters. There were many lovable personalities throughout the series, and while some continued to develop, others like Nakanishi or Senda could have had some more time dedicated to them, seeing how they were both constants throughout the series.  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is relatively consistent throughout the show. Released in 2009 by SynergySP, Cross Game definitely isn\u2019t one of the top shows in the animation department; however, the series definitely wins some points with its charm in character design. Even though the art style might not seem too refined, it is easy to grow onto, and within a dozen episodes, one will hardly notice any huge complaints in that department. \\n\\n\r\nOne step above the animation is the quality of Cross Game\u2019s soundtrack and voice acting. While there isn\u2019t anything in particular that stands out about the voice acting, Irino Miyu\u2019s Kitamura Kou and Tomatsu Haruka\u2019s Tsukishima Aoba were a fine lead pair. The true standout of Cross Game\u2019s sound set was its OST, which includes several tracks that were awe-inspiring when played alongside certain scenes. However, the OST probably was not used to its full potential mostly because the most captivating tracks were saved for the grandest moments, and most of the series consisted of lighthearted moments with lighthearted tunes to match it. The only opening of the series, Summer Rain, was an excellent choice to carry the series through 50 whole episodes. The first ending, Koi Kogarete Mita Yume, was my personal favorite and a highly emotional ballad. The other endings were all solid with their own respects. \\n\\n\r\nThey say to never judge a book by its cover, and Cross Game is an excellent example that supports this time-worn metaphor. Underneath a genre filled with complexities and controversy, Cross Game flourishes with a simple tale to tell, and it\u2019s given a lengthy amount of time to do so. Unhurried, yet engaging \u2013 simple, but beautiful \u2013 Cross Game was an emotional and memorable experience that has undoubtedly been the best Sports-related anime I\u2019ve watched thus far. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Version\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\n+ Charming design\\n\r\n+ Consistent animation\\n\r\n-  Nothing too special \\n\r\n-  A few gaffes in animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\r\n+ Extensive cast that is believably human\\n\r\n+ Heavy emotional connection\\n\r\n+ Excellent Development\\n\r\n+ Does not fall victim to repetitive tropes\\n\r\n-  Some characters could\u2019ve used more attention\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\n+ Excellent OST and op/ed sequences\\n\r\n+ Solid voice acting\\n\r\n-  Some wasted potential in soundtrack usage\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\n+ Engaging story that is simple at heart\\n\r\n+ Nearly perfect pacing that always keeps the viewer at the edge of her seat\\n\r\n+ Highly entertaining baseball games\\n\r\n+ Mixes well with characters\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.3/10, Highly recommended for anyone to give a try.

            "content": "Cross Game is a very special show. Unlike most shows today, Cross Game is treats both its characters and the audience with respect. On paper, it looks to be yet another baseball series, but it shines as a rare gem of the genre.\r\nThe most significant difference between Cross Game and other sports shows is its willingness to portray the characters outside the sport - showing who they are as people - what they care about, what they like, who they are. Cross game is really more of a slice of life rather than a sports show - There are often long periods of extended sliceof life sequences wherein all we see are the characters going about living their daily lives, something unheard of in most shows which rush to showcase the exciting and hot-blooded sports action. This is a testament to the strengths of the show, trusting in its stellar character writing to carry itself.\\n\\n\r\nI earlier mentioned that this shows treats its characters with respect. That is easily the most charming part of the show. Gone are the ridiculous slapstick sequences or the completely ridiculous and convenient misunderstandings that occur because a character decided to act completely against his or her pre-established personality and motivations. Cross Game takes the time it needs to develop its characters, allowing us to slowly know them as we watch them go through their daily lives, through their interactions with the other characters and through a large number of well-placed flashbacks. This allows them to grow beyond the typical traditional character archetypes, with every character given the space and time needed to develop and grow.\\n\\n\r\nThe past plays an important role in the show. We start off the series with an extended prologue of sorts, going back to the past when our characters were children. It covers a certain event which has huge implications on the characters, as well as giving us a glimpse of the personalities of the characters, and an idea of who they are. This allows us to see how they have changed with the passage of time, and how the event has affected them. It sets the tone for the rest of the series, and is an amazing pilot which serves to capture your attention.\\n\\n\r\nI also mentioned that the show treats its audience with respect. What I mean by this is that it is not a show which feels the need to explicitly state what the characters are feeling through narration, which can oftentimes be a very clunky tool. We never get into the characters heads where they outright say what they feel, but we always know what they are feeling and what they are thinking by virtue of the stellar direction. It is a very subtle show that constantly gives hints about what the characters are thinking, trusting in the audience to interpret those signs. It is a show wherein a simple look, laugh, or a word can mean much more than a whole episode of dialogue in a typical show.\\n\\n\r\nYou might have noticed that I have said little about what is thought of as the meat of the story - baseball. This is simply because the baseball takes a backseat to the characters. You don't watch this show for the baseball - it is honestly nothing special and there are certainly much better shows out there. The segments are competent enough and are usually exciting to watch, but it is merely well-done, and nothing too special. And that's perfectly fine for the series - it really isn't about the baseball. The baseball is simply the backdrop for the series, and never the true focus of the series. This means that you should really watch this show even if don't typically enjoy the sports genre - what Cross Game brings to the table is a highly unique experience that everyone can enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values of the show are sadly nothing to write home about, and the art and animation of the show is nothing special. This is perfectly fine though for a 50 episode series, and whilst not outstanding, is certainly suitable for the show. Where it excels in is its stellar soundtrack - containing many strong pieces that are well-used. Of particular note is the first ED, which perfectly sets the tone for the series and is used masterfully in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Cross Game is a show that you really should watch. It is through and through a character work, one which prioritizes the growth of its characters over everything else. This means that it doesn't really have a point or a lesson to drive home, and is simply a simple story about a group of people. But what makes it a great is the painstaking effort and love put into them, turning it from a simple story to an emotionally powerful masterpiece.",

            "content": "Well, I will say first of all that both this manga and anime are perfectly nice, perfectly pleasant, and probably perfectly enjoyable for a lot of people. It is all smiles (except for Aoba who is, you know, completely incapable of anything but frowning or looks of indignation), all optimism, and simple but sweet. Unfortunately, that keeps it from being very good either.\r\nThe story is your typical \"gets one star, enjoys a meteoric rise to the near top, loses anyway, probably eventually wins but ONLY in the very last year\" formula. Typical to this, ONLY the protagonists and \"notable\" opponents ever in ANY way matter.The only real gags in the entire anime revolve the few times they do not have the protagonists/notables easily succeed...which is not a very good gag element. The only real change to the overall plot tendencies is that they throw in a tragedy, and the tragedy is not a very good one...having to see people get all sadfaced and wax nostalgic about it is pretty annoying, and the onslaught of flashbacks repeated, while not as bad as it could be, is fairly overboard.\\n\\n\r\nTo the actual baseball parts of the action, since pretty much the largest negative emotions it displays are an \"oi oi oi\" \"are you kidding me\" attitude, there are not really any sore losers or sore winners. I know that the cliche \"big personalities! ridiculous action!\" shounens are not that great either, but all this manages to produce is a baseball team with no personality, taking matters to the other extreme. The baseball games are never really interesting because of this, and there is no real reason to sympathize with the team and want it to win no matter how much time they spend on all of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty weak. It is nice that Ko is not a brat, but he is also pretty bland, having no real personality to speak of...this goes for a lot of characters, probably everyone but Aoba really. Their personalities are pretty much all \"stare around thoughtfully/at another person, crack a smile, play baseball\". I appreciate that they wanted to use silence to set some sort of tone, but they failed to craft any meaningful personalities because of it. Unfortunately, Aoba is your standard grade unenjoyable tsundere who does NOTHING but complain and lie about her \"true feelings\" for 50 episodes, so she is not a good break from all of this at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a nice style, but it has some major problems. The character art becomes very chunky and bold in a lot of zoom ins for some reason, despite having previously looked fine zoomed out just seconds before. The next biggest problem are the mouths, which are some of the least expressive I have ever seen in an anime...just because you chose a simple style does not mean you have to totally cop out of drawing faces! They pretty much are just a barely open o ( or closed | all of the time. The other biggest flaw with the art is the coloring - everything is vivid, but nothing actually has any detail! Pay attention and you will notice this is true...it does not ruin the anime, but it makes it difficult to find much interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very smooth most of the time, a real treat to watch actually, but it also deals in most of the major problems of modern anime. It has a ton of slow zoom ins on characters to simulate movement that is not there. It has tons of white action lines to simulate false excitement in the sports scenes (no idea why, they ACTUALLY decently animate most of the time, so why do this?) - this happens more as the anime goes on, initially it was rare. There are lots of repeat moments (as in triple takes et cetera), lots of white outs during action scenes to try to draw out and create a bigger impact, and other various tricks that really fall flat...again, it is not bad enough to destroy the in episode pacing or destroy the \"feel\", but it is overboard and slightly distracting.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is completely average, and the music is terrible and interferes with a lot of moments.\\n\\n\r\nA final miscellaneous flaw is that the transitions are incessant and really poorly done. Oftentimes they will flash to some random scenery and pan straight up, this happens literally about 30 times. Also literally about 30 times they will use the terribly drawn cat (worst part of this anime) to clumsily transition.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a decent sports anime/manga, but really I would say that not only are there better slice of lifes around, and alternately there are better hot blooded sports anime/manga around, and that I would fill my time with either of those alternatives first before looking to a work like this.",

            "content": "Cross Game is the latest story from Adachi to be animated.  Once again, Koshien rules!\r\nIf anyone has watched or read any of Adachi's previous stories (Touch, H2) than you will know what to expect: Great characters (albeit looking the same as ever!), a great story, lots of dry humor, and the ever-present dream of going to Koshien.  However, there are some subtle differences with this story and characters that I think make Cross Game Adachi's best work so far.  I'll get more in depth with that a little later.  On to some categories:\r\nArt/Animation - 7/10\r\nSome people may find the art alittle bland.  However, I am going to pretty much ignore the drawing style, as it is entirely based on Adachi's drawing style, and as he has been successful it it for a long time, there really is no need to address it.  However, his drawing style is mostly reflected on the character designs.  Other than that, the art is stunning, especially the clouds when they show the sky (which they do often). I will talk about the animation, though, which is what most of my score is based on.  Overall, the animation is fine, but it suffers somewhat because of the drawing style, which tends to produce bland looking animation.  It also seemed to me that the director took a look at the huge success of Touch and thought that they could copy some of the animation styles from that time, which also drags it down a little bit.  However, the animation is still crisp and lifelike, especially at crucial moments in the baseball games, which is where it probably needs the most focus, and they did a great job of that.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThey picked a good first opening song for this anime.  There is only one so far (Summer Rain) through 30 episodes, and I imagine there will be another one soon.  Summer Rain has a nice touch of acoustic guitar that leads into the rock song.  The band has a nice male singer with pretty good range. The opening animations are also very good.  The endings so far have been pretty good as well, although I don't listen to endings very much.  I like the second ending better than the first, but that pretty much all I have to say on that.  The background sound/music is also very good.  It reflects the tension very well during games, and is very good at setting the mood at the batting center and in homes as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the characters are the star of the show, and are the reason the premise behind Cross Game works.  Without good characters, there is no way anyone would want to keep reading and watching Adachi's works.\\n\\n\r\nThe hero of the story is Kou Kitamura, son of the owner of Kitamura Sports.  When we first meet him as a child and later as a middle-schooler, he is aloof and self-centered, but he shows flashes of competitiveness and compassion, which increase their presence in his character throughout the show and create a very likable hero.  His dream of making it to Koshien is based on Wakaba's dream of Kou pitching in the Koshien in front of a sellout crowd.\\n\\n\r\nThe next character to talk about is Tsukishima Wakaba.  Although she really is a minor character in terms of real-life presence, her influence is seen throughout the entire show and behind many of the motivations that the characters have.  Her death is a tear jerking one, and from then on, while she is not seen again in the real life of the characters, numerous flashbacks and memories that Kou, Aoba, and some others have of her remind us of her influence, sometimes to an annoying extent (although not very often).  Her character is almost perfect, and made more so because of her death, which I think is kind of lame in that there are no moments of Wakaba as anything other than a good girl.  She is always kind, beautiful but not conceited, and she only shows selfishness with her relationship with Kou.\\n\\n\r\nThe second main character and the heroine of the show is Tsukishima Aoba, the third daughter of the Tsukishima family.  Aoba is loves baseball and is fiercely competitive.  She was also jealous of Kou as he spent so much time with her older sister, Wakaba, and early on declares her dislike of Kou, though he doesn't seem to care.  Aoba's competitiveness never changes throughout the story, even though she knows she will never be able to play an official baseball game in high school.  Aoba and Kou are constantly at odds with each other, and provide great humor and banter in their encounters, which happen often as they live right next to each other.\\n\\n\r\nAkaishi Osamu is Kou's catcher and bats fifth.  He was tough guy at a young age, but after Wakaba died, who he liked, he became more considerate of others.  He also was the one who heard Wakaba's dream of Koshien, with Kou pitching, Akaishi catching, and Aoba in center field.  He, along with Kou fight to make Wakaba's dream come true. \\n\\n\r\nAzuma Yuuhei is the fourth batter of the Sheishu High team.  He was a star player in middle school who came to Sheishu because of a gathering of famous middle school players under a new coach who promised a trip to Koshien.  When the coach quit, most of the other players left, but he stayed behind, believing that Kou had what it took to reach Koshien.\\n\\n\r\nNakanishi Daiki is Kou's friend from childhood.  He was Kou's catcher throughout middle school, but moved to third base at Sheishu High.  He bats third.\\n\\n\r\nSenda Keiichirou is the shortstop and leadoff batter on the Sheishu High team.  He has a big ego and likes to act flashy, which the caoch calls \"perfect\" for a shortshop.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Cross Game flows in a laid back matter.  The motivations of each character are conveyed very smoothly and there are no real inconsistencies within the plot, which is reflective of Adachi's genius as a storyteller. The story sneaks up on you and begins to encompass you, whether you want to or not, and because the characters aren't so easy to figure out at times, it keeps you guessing as well, which keeps you engaged.   The only issues I have with the story is that the influence of Wakaba seems a bit too much, and she annoys me at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow the pace is a bit slow, and that may turn some people off, but this is no high profile action series.  This also isn't a comedy either, but it also doesn't become overly dramatic.  The show is character-driven and has virtually no plot holes, so, it doesn't become confusing, which often takes away enjoyment, especially with a drama like Cross Game is.  It's an interesting show to watch and the pacing of the show, as well as the right balance of action, comedy, and character development serve to ensure that you keep watching from one episode to the next.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the plot may be simplistic (Go to Koshien! Rah! Rah!) at times, Cross Game doesn't depend on a complex plot, as the show all about the characters than anything else. The main focus of the show, from beginning to end, are the characters. This is emphasized by the fact that the action and drama clearly take second place to each of the characters, and therein lies its genius.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:  9/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Many people perceive the combination of genres \"School\" \"Romance\" and \"Drama\" as usual \"stamps\" in the anime of the industry, and this is understandable, since often such shows are filled with a lot of banal events. Having started watching Cross Game, a skeptical viewer, most likely, will be pleasantly surprised. It is pleasant to realize that already the genre in which, it would seem, it is impossible to find anything new, there are some exceptions that not only make it interesting to watch what is happening, but also in certain events can surprise.\r\nStory tells about a boy named Kou Kitamura and four sisters of Tsukishimaliving with him in the neighborhood. The sisters are called Ichiyou, Wakaba, Aoba and Momiji. Wakaba and Kou were born on the same day in the same hospital. They are so close that Wakaba refers to Kou, as to his boyfriend, although Kou does not think so. Aoba, who is younger than Wakaba for a year, dislikes Kou for the fact that he, in her opinion, is trying to take her sister away from her. After, Kou and Aoba are gradually converging and are striving to realize the Wakaba dream - to see their play at the school championship on baseball, held at the stadium Koshien.\\n\\n\r\nCross Game is a story about a hard-working young man and a talented girl who is very fond of baseball. Without excessive pathos, with the charm inherent in the classic anime, this series tells about the most important things.  Story is relatively simple - like the plot of most films about human relationships. The series covers a rather large part of the narrative, it describes more than five years of life of the main characters. It should be noted that, with the \"Slice of life\" genre, every episode of the series looks with interest, the narrative does not break into events that are not necessary for the viewer. One of the main advantages of this series are the characters, let's move directly to them.\\n\\n\r\nAs it should be, in the works of Adachi, his certain style of art is preserved and it is on him that should be paid the main attention. Thanks to his own style of drawing, such amazing characters are obtained. Simply painted on the outside, similar in appearance to each other characters, inside are very deeply worked out, which causes a pleasant surprise. \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the narrative, Kou is a fifth-grade pupil of primary school, and later goes to Seishuu High School. Since his childhood, he spends a lot of time with Wakaba, and their families look at them as if they were a couple. He does not show outsiders his interest in baseball and regularly trains in the center of Tsukishima, he began training since he learned to hold a baseball bat. The series tells not only his story: the plot is divided roughly equally between him and Aoba, whose interests are incredibly similar. Aoba is the third daughter in Tsukishima's family, she is one year younger than Kou and Wakaba. She a tomboy, very fond of baseball. When she was little, her father often played ball with her, and so she became a strong pitcher. Mysterious Kou and energetic, persistent, mocking Aoba. These characters give two visions of the same story. Kou externally amused and carefree, whatever events happen to him. But in fact, these events worry and upset him more than others. Noisy behavior Aoba is just a mask, she understands that thanks to this no one will hear what she really wants to say. This plays into her hands, because she prefers not to give out her true thoughts and feelings. In this series, characters can play a crucial role, almost not appearing on the screen. For example, Wakaba is not the main character, but her role is very important, in connection with what she means for the main characters. The genius of the series lies in the interactions of the characters, it is they who create such a living atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nInteraction of secondary characters, also performed at a high level. Here will not be stamped characters for waste of screen time. Every character will disclosed enough to make you remember them. This is surprising, because, as mentioned earlier, from such genres you usually expect standard stamp-characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt is worth paying attention to the humor. It is very important to present it at a certain moment. The main thing in humor - this is the right time for filing, with which Cross Game handles perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound and music, everything is done at the highest level here. Soundtracks perfectly match the atmosphere of the show. Energetic and cheerful sounds, at some point in the series can be replaced by sad and melancholy pianos, which perfectly convey the mental state of characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, the anime has a sport genre, which is one of the most interesting, as it always \"unties the hands\" of the creators. Due to his correct representation, he constantly keeps the viewer in suspense. That is, in addition to the personal relations of the characters, the viewer is also interested with the sports component, since the combination of the two genres \"Slice of life\" and \"Sport\" is just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSo, how much on your memory do you remember such kind, unpredictable and touching stories? How many times have you been given the opportunity to follow the story of the character since his childhood, and so that it was interesting? Cross Game having a simple look, with a kind of banal genres, completely inverts the notion of them. This is new word in the anime industry, to repeat such an ideal combination of genres will be very difficult.  Also, with confidence, I can say that even if you are not a big fan of baseball (or not at all fond of them), you will still be interested in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the best sports romance of all time. Take time for Cross Game.\\n",

            "content": "When I think of Cross Game, I can't help but smile. It is without a doubt my current favorite slice of life anime. Those turned off by sports series need to look past that when picking up Cross Game. While baseball is a huge part of the series, the relationships between the characters is the biggest part of what makes it amazing. Baseball is simply apart of their lives. Those who enjoy character heavy slice of life anime will feel right at home with Cross Game.\r\n--\r\nStory and Characters:\r\nCross Game's story is a beautiful blending life's two wonders -- drama and comedy. While the comedy issubtle and often unspoken, it fits perfectly into the situations, making it a big part of the series' appeal. Adachi is a genius at progressing the story through more than just dialogue and physical action, but through the unspoken emotion given off by the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe many different relationships shared by the characters is the true wonder of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe cold, yet close relationship between Kou and Aoba is amazing to watch unfold throughout the series. In many ways I believe Aoba's cold attitude towards Kou stems not just from a jealousy of the time he spent with Wakaba, but from the fact that because she always liked him, she was jealous of the time Wakaba spent with him. Aoba knew Kou was a good guy, yet Wakaba loved him, so instead of getting closer to him and torturing herself, she decided to push him away with outward hate. And after Wakaba's death, she could have gotten closer to Kou, but the fact that he reminded her of Wakaba so much only fueled her outward feelings of disdain. \\n\\n\r\nThe other interesting relationship in the series was Kou and Akaishi. Akaishi seemed to hate Kou because of his relationship with Wakaba (much like Aoba), but instead of hating him after her death, he wanted to get closer and befriend Kou. This not only because of something Wakaba once said to him, but because being around Kou allowed him to be reminded of Wakaba.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plently of other character relationships that help add to the story, but those are two of the main ones I wanted to shed some light on.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Cross Game, like Adachi's other work, is simple, yet wonderful. The actual animation done is mostly the characters, with well drawn, but overall static backgrounds to support them. Despite this simplicity, the show appears beautiful with vibrant colors, leaving you with a light and good feeling.\\n\\n\r\nThe score throughout the show fits perfectly into each scene, with a pick up or drop in intensity when needed. The only opening theme of the show, Summer Rain, is one of my favorite ever in a series. It's one of those feel good songs that I looked forward to at the start of each episode. The various ending themes started with a rather melancholic song, yet allowed you to enjoy it while reflecting on the events of the past episode. From there the ending themes got a little more cheerful, evolving with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters' voices are virtually flawless, each matching the look and tone of their respective character perfectly no matter what the situation.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show probably more than any other anime I've ever viewed. It's just such a beautifully written and paced show with a wide variety of interesting characters that almost make you wish the show could go on forever. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned in my opening statement, don't be turned off by the sports genre stamped on this series. This is one of the best slice of life shows you'll ever see and turning a blind eye to it because it also happens to be about baseball is only doing yourself a injustice.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\n10/10 across the board.",

            "content": "Sometimes, simplicity is a beautiful thing. At the heart of \"Cross Game\" is a simple shounen story about baseball and romance. But even though it's the kind of story where you can roughly predict the ending within the first few episodes, there's never a dull moment. Heart warming, heart wrenching, beautiful in its simplicity... the joy of watching \"Cross Game\" comes not from its destination, but from the journey itself.\r\nDespite being a predictable story at its core, \"Cross Game\" begins in a way that is anything but predictable, featuring an early twist in the tale that no doubt comes as a big surprise to themajority of viewers. Because of this twist, \"Cross Game\" is not an anime that's easy to review, as the remainder of the series is built around this early key event, and it's nigh on impossible to go into details about a lot of the qualities \"Cross Game\" possesses - such as how it completely turns the conventions of character development on its head - without spoiling it. The twist itself is not only remarkable in its timing and its impact on the remainder of the story, but also in its dramatisation... or rather lack of. They would have been forgiven for making a meal of it on such an occasion, but instead it is handled in a surprisingly subtle and understated manner (in truth I actually found it to be a bit *too* understated). \\n\\n\r\nAnd in fact \"understated\" is a word that describes \"Cross Game\" perfectly as a whole. This is especially noteworthy considering it's a shounen, a genre famous for its flamboyant production. \"Cross Game\" barely uses any production gimmicks, as it goes about its business in a refreshingly quiet, down to earth manner. The rather plain art style, reflecting the low key dramatisation, is probably the weak link in the series. The lack of effort that can be seen in the excessive panning upwards towards the clouds (this is used so much it's almost like a running joke) and the sub-standard character designs (there are a lot of similar looking characters, and everyone have monkey ears) is likely to put off a lot of viewers. But you'll probably regret it if you completely ignore \"Cross Game\" just because of the unspectacular exterior. Because in all honesty, this is one of the most pleasant, likeable shows I've ever watched, and it's a travesty that not more people have seen it. \\n\\n\r\nI guess the other main reason a lot of people haven't tried \"Cross Game\" is because of its baseball tag. Now, I'm not particularly interested in nor knowledgeable about baseball, so I can't really comment much on the technical side of things, but the baseball part of \"Cross Game\" can still be enjoyed without too much knowledge about the game. As I've already stated, the anime doesn't heavily use the over the top embellishment omnipresent in shounen sports anime, and nor does it have a bad habit of dragging games out - even the longest games take just a couple of episodes to complete. More importantly though, baseball isn't crucial to enjoying \"Cross Game\". The fact that the source material is done by an author who is famous for his baseball mangas comes as a massive suprise to me, because if you haven't come across his other works before, like me, you would probably think that such an author would put more emphasis on baseball... but instead it plays second fiddle to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nBecause even more than baseball, \"Cross Game\" is about the chemistry between the members of the cast, and about growing up. Though it's arguable whether its shounen content prevents it from being a slice of life, there is no doubt that, in the very least, it shares a lot of the values with shows of that genre. There's often a strong sense of melancholy and nostalgia, and yet it's not a show that's shackled by the past - it's about moving on, and in fact it's the past the provides the inspiration for the characters to strive forward. A painstaking amount of attention has been given to fine-tuning the character interactions. The delicate nuances and countless metaphors and double meanings in the dialogues not only enriches the interchanges between the characters but also gives the show great rewatch value. It's easy to miss a few hidden meanings just by having a short lapse in concentration, and in fact there is so much subtlety in the dialogues that notable difference to the implied meanings can be drawn out just from watching different translations. In addition, \"Cross Game\" is also content with devoting a significant number of episodes concentrating on the mundane, every day stuff. The episodes about buying a birthday present, about valentines day, about taking care of someone who's caught a cold... it's actually these small but priceless distractions from the main plot that, along with its attention to details regarding character interactions, brings \"Cross Game\" to full bloom. \\n\\n\r\nKo Kitamura makes for quite an unusual main character, especially for a shounen anime. In fact he has most of the qualities normally reserved for an intriguing, dark horse type side character. Usually, the main character of a shounen anime comes in two flavours. The most common one being some level 1 loser who gets bullied a lot and who ceases to function in front of girls (Ippo from \"Hajime no Ippo\" being a classic case), and watching them improve is a bit like playing an RPG game, where you have to slowly grind up the levels. But occasionally you also have characters like Akagi from, er,  \"Akagi\", a badass anti-hero who is virtually untouchable from episode 1. Ko is not like either of those. Instead he's somewhere in between, and comes off as a mostly normal, believable character but with that extra something about him. He gets a headstart in terms of baseball skills, and within very few episodes shows himself to be quite a special player without the usual montages and \"level grinding\". Moreover, he doesn't start from the bottom of the social ladder either. He's popular in school, possesses a sharp sense of humour, a quiet air of confidence and maturity, and is incredibly dependable both on and off the baseball grounds. Even though baseball is important to him in a personal way, he's wise enough to recognise that there are far more important things in life, and would willingly give up all he has achieved in baseball at the drop of a hat if it can be exchanged away for those more important things. Out of the whole cast, he's probably also the one that's hardest to read - he doesn't show his emotions or thoughts easily, but not to the superhuman extent of the aforementioned Akagi. This makes him kinda enigmatic but in a believable way - most of the time, his casual exterior can fool everyone apart from those that are closest to him, but at the same time you can often make a good guess at what he's thinking from the subtle signs that he drops. What he does share with common main characters though, is his willingness to try hard, but he does this in a way that reminds me of a character from \"Planetes\" nicknamed Miss Swan. This nickname came about because like swans, she's all graceful and elegant on the surface, but underwater, she's padding away like crazy. A similar analogy can be applied to Ko, who, despite looking so calm and nonchalant all the time, is trying harder than almost anyone to reach his goals. And when it matters, there are few better people to put your trust in. All in all, like one the characters put it, \"Ko sure is a cool guy\". \\n\\n\r\nFrom the point of view of character development though, it's probably Aoba that takes the biscuit. She starts off in the anime as a baseball loving tomboy. In this anime there's probably no one who loves the game more than her, no one who puts in as much effort as she does, and no one who has to make as much sacrifices as she does. The tragic thing is that because she's a girl, she is unable to take part in the high school baseball tournament representing the school that she attends. But to see this as wasted effort is to undermine her the sacrifice she chooses to make later on in the series.\\n\\n\r\nKo and Aoba are both interesting in the their own right, but when they come together, they become the show's highlight. Aobo hates Ko from a young age because he always monopolised her sister Wakaba's attention whenever they're together... but also because of how similar her own personality is to Ko's - this is especially a problem considering their competitive streaks. It honestly is delightful watching the two of them clash over every little thing, uncanny to see their mutual understanding, and satisfying in the extreme to see the trust and mutual respect that grudgingly develop between them. Because of the remarkable similarity between them, by appreciating what makes Ko so great, Aoba also begins to appreciate her the strengths of her own personality.\\n\\n\r\nWakaba is another character worthy of note. Though sweet and innocent, she possesses a maturity and wisdom far beyond her years, and her strong personality inspires everyone whose lives she touched, bringing out their very best qualities. If she has any faults, it's that her character is probably designed *too* perfectly... but I guess this ties in with the simplicity that's the essence of this show. Wakaba inspires a great many characters in \"Cross Game\", but perhaps none more so than Akaishi, the big guy with the even bigger heart. He starts off as a common bully, but ends as an incredibly endearing, selfless character. There are other great characters found in support too, like Azuma, who we initially see as just a baseball player devoid of emotions and completely focused on winning. As the series progresses, he becomes more and more human underneath his unchanging expression. Oh yeah, and I love his dead pan, cutting one liners.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few characters I would like to have seen more of though, in particular Nakanishi and the baseball coach. I'd like to have seen more of Nakanishi because he played quite an important role in the early part of the series, and it's a shame that later on he becomes little more than a joke character both on and off the baseball grounds. As for the coach, his tactical know-how and knowledge about the game is said to be extraordinary, but as the show went on, this aspect seems to get neglected, and it felt more and more like Akaishi is the one running the show on the tactical side. Aoba's cousin Mizuki's presence also faded after the first few episodes, but unlike the others, I'd rather have seen less rather than more of him. He struck me as a bit of a redundant character, and I don't really know why he was introduced in the first place (although he is responsible for drawing out one of the most hilarious one liners in the series from Azuma).\\n\\n\r\nThese are all smallish problems though. The one big problem in the cast is Akane. Her appearance mid series threw a big spanner in the works, and I really didn't like that. Up until the point of her introduction, \"Cross Game\" is a very straight forward show (apart from the early twist), and it should have stayed that way. Akane's introduction feels like a Clannad-esq twist to complicate things. But thankfully, \"Cross Game\" is not \"Clannad\", and so does not take the cheap option that the latter most likely would have taken. In the end, none of the melodramatic endings that I was dreading came to pass. To be honest, the result rarely looked in doubt. It felt like Akane merely stalled things a little rather than knock them completely off track. In fact, she eventually becomes the catalyst, and is involved in some poignant scenes that helped to offset her introduction (which I think should never have happened).\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime approached its climax, key events starts coming in thick and fast, with almost every episode throwing up some significant development. These kind of got ruined by the previews though - they spoilt way too much for me. I often ended up watching an episode with great anticipation, only to find to my disappointment that the previews at the end of the previous episode had already picked out most if not all the choicest lines, leaving very little behind for me to discover for myself. So, if you're watching it for the first time, I highly recommend that you skip the previews.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, complaints about Akane and the previews aside, the second half of \"Cross Game\" is still really good overall. But as everyone knows, bad endings can marr an otherwise fantastic series. And when you boil down to the bare facts, the ending of \"Cross Game\" is a very simple and predictable one... and it just goes to show that the simplicity of an ending does not necessarily stop it from also being an incredible one. The last episode features a double climax that simultaneously hits the emotional apex both on and off the baseball field, followed by a gentle, blissful wind down in the second half. It's so simple, so beautiful, so satisfying, so perfect. \\n\\n\r\nIn this current era, \"Cross Game\" is a breath of fresh air, an anime that isn't hampered by cynical pandering nor reliant on melodrama and flashy production values. But despite its understated style and lack of gimmicks, it is as powerful as the best dramas and as addictive as the best shounens. And despite being a shounen, it's as human as the best slice of lifes and as sweet as the best shoujos. It's an anime that, while not seeming to be special in any way, ends up being oh so special.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nAs an aside, I'd like to talk a bit about the anime adaptation of \"Cross Game\". Unsurprisingly, \"Cross Game\" left a bit of a void in my life after I finished it, like I knew it would from just the first few episodes. This led me to follow up by reading through the manga, which allowed me to gain some insight into some of changes made during the anime adaptation. For the most part, the anime follows the manga pretty faithfully. A few subtle points are removed here and there, and other events are added in order to expand a chapter in the manga into a full episode. The two main changes though, are the way the anime reordered events to bring forward the early twist to be even earlier, and the expansion on Aoba's girls' baseball try out that only briefly gets mentioned in a single scene in the manga. Given the general result when anime studios try to mess around with the source material, it's normal to have certain reservations about changes. However, I honestly think that in the case of \"Cross Game\", most of the changes are made for the better. Changing the order of events allowed the anime to hit the ground running amongst other things, and fleshing out the girls baseball trials adds extra weight onto the decision made by Aoba later on in the series. The anime also enhanced the sweet and innocent feel of the work by removing most of the terribly inappropriate fan service that turned up on occasion in the manga. Add to this the competent voice acting and the music - who can forget the extended version of the first ending theme that was used to such potent effect - and you have yourself one very, very nice adaptation.",

            "content": "*Note: This review does not contain spoilers, but indirectly alludes to events that take place during the first episode*\r\n------\r\nWe all have ghosts. And if yours are of the variety that come from losing someone you love, this anime is about to take you on a ride you'll not soon forget. Don't let the younger characters and apparent focus on baseball catch you off-guard: This is a coming-of-age story about how a young ensemble cast reconcile themselves with a tragedy and their memories of what was lost, while finding themselves and each other along the way. Their quest for the Koshien masks this deeper goal, butthe baseball provides a fitting context to drive the character development, which is the heart of this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is not overly complicated, and the slow pace of the series might frustrate viewers who are more accustomed to action or plot-heavy series. This is definitely a slice-of-life anime, but it nevertheless manages to inject significant suspense elements, and balances its more serious themes with a healthy dose of comedy. However, unlike many series in the genre that tend to drift or take a lot of time to ground their characters and story elements, Cross Game front-loads its first episode and sets up a scenario that pulls at a viewer's heartstrings, drawing them in. The most significant criticism that can be leveled against it is that if you've seen Touch, you will find that Cross Game borrows heavily, even if it ultimately carves out its own path. On the bright side though, those who have not had the pleasure of enjoying Cross Game's older predecessor from the 1980s will have 101 more episodes of beautiful storytelling to look forward to. \\n\\n\r\nWith a *very* significant exception, the soundtrack is not particularly remarkable. The OP does invoke the feeling of lazy days of summer, and the quality of most of the ED's is pretty hit/miss. Having said that, the first ED is absolutely stunning and instead of feeling \"tacked on,\" integrates itself beautifully into the first episode - it's probably one of the most emotionally powerful uses of music you'll ever come across in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is simple and clean, but if you're looking for spectacular lighting effects or incredibly detailed designs, you won't find them here. At the same time, the style fits the series like a glove and the strong character development mitigates this to the point where you may not even notice the absence of flashy graphical effects. My experience was that despite its simplicity, small but significant art details had a strong effect - notable examples include the rusted-out and cold appearance of the Clover cafe/batting center contrasting with the warm personalities that inhabit the place, or the inherent symbolism in the series' trademark four-leaf clover with one petal colored a slightly lighter shade of green. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's the bottom line? Cross Game will make you cry. Then it will make you laugh. Then it will make you cry again. Along the way, you might find that you liked baseball a lot more than you thought you would. Most importantly, you'll love every minute. A must-see.",

            "content": "Writing a review over a sports anime is something I myself never expected to do but Cross Game is in a different league and deserved one. Sports anime generally stick with the basic formula of 1 person having amazing talent and taking a team by his/her hand and making it the best team there is, now if you read the synopsis you will have the same impression as you have with any sports anime however Cross Game(CG from here on) is not your usual sports anime.\r\nStory~10: As I mentioned above, CG seems to be your usual sports anime but right after the 1st episode itwill leave you in awe and shrugs off any bad expectations and will not give you the slightest opening to let you have them return, it was truly the best opening for an anime that I have seen so far. Every single time you think that it will be predictable, it surprises you.\\n\r\nCG has a nice flow and pace and before you know it you will have clicked on next episode for the whole day, don't let the 'all ages' rating turn you off, there is plenty of drama in the 1st episode already which made me even doubt that rating.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 50 episodes and usually what bothers me with animes that have 20+ episodes is that fillers will bump in, this is not the case with CG, there is 1 filler episode and even that is not really a filler, it adds to the anime in some way. Having that said, I actually wished that it would have lasted longer, the ending was alright but I have this urge to actually know how the whole tournament ended which is never shown though it was probably done so the viewer would go into their imagination world.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point that CG delivered well were the jokes, punchlines were everywhere and the comedy didn't come only from the supporting characters, it came from anyone, whether they were 1 episode flies or main characters. Something that should also be mentioned is the usage of flashbacks, they play a major role in this anime and they will explain some of the characters actions or their emotions, they were never bothersome and would always give an explanation.\\n\\n\r\nNow what is most important in a sports anime is of course the action or matches, they were always packed with tension and surprises, let me tell you that this is no anime with all super heroes that win every single match with a major difference in score, the results were always believable and the matches were astonishingly well made, the matches were truly matches that would make you root for them, at least I did and i'm sure I am not the only one who did. From what I heard the writer of the story is involved in the real baseball world, so it might explain a thing or two.\\n\\n\r\nArt~8: This is really something that bothered me at the start, huge ears is something you can't overlook and generally the hair style of some characters are what you could call weird or at least bothersome. Now you have to take into consideration that it is made for all ages, and you will eventually get used to it. The background is well done and emotions were well drawn out. What occurred to me was that the art actually got better the further you get into the episodes, so it is something you can look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nSound~9: Opening song is quite catchy and I myself never skipped it, it's just your usual J-Pop but an enjoyable 1. There are 5 different ending songs, all J-Pop as well, the last ending song (Koi Suru Otome by Natsuko Kondo) made the ending of the anime just that bit better.\\n\r\nBGM is almost never there, but when it was, it was blended well with the action on screen or just the right one to bring out the emotions better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters~10: There are 2 main characters and they have the relationship of childhood 'friends', why that is, is something you'll have to watch the anime for.\\n\r\nWe have Kitamura Kou, the male main protagonist and a promising pitcher who looked up to Tsukishima Aoba, the female protagonist, his reason for playing baseball is actually inspirable and will be explained, you guessed it, by memories. Both are likeable main protagonists and their relationship with each other will leave you laughing every now and then.\\n\r\nTsukishima Aoba is as I said the female main protagonist, she is Kou's pitching mentor and he has his form from her, she is in a male's baseball team which leaves her unable to play for them and always having to watch the game from the stands, the reason why she plays for them is already explained in the first couple of episodes and further explained as the episodes pass by.\\n\r\nI will briefly explain the most important supporting characters;\\n\r\nTsukishima Wakaba, Aoba's older sister and in love with Kitamura Kou, the main reason behind everything that happens and generally the main character in the memories.\\n\r\nAzuma Yuuhei, 4th batter for the team and able to hit near every ball that could be thrown, was an antagonist at the beginning but has reasons for changing, has sort of the advisory role in relationships.\\n\r\nTakigawa Akane, Akane puts the whole anime in a bullettrain and will leave you in awe, you will not see her appearance coming and is the switch that will put everything in motion.\\n\r\nAkaishi Osamu, the catcher and brain behind the team, was in love with Wakaba changed to a catcher from being a pitcher because of her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment~10, CG is truly a masterpiece and is nr48. on the ranking not for nothing, it has action, drama, comedy and tension in the matches and with some romance as well. It will have you in it's grisp straight after the first episode and will not let you go. I highly recommend CG to everyone, as it was inspiring and beautifully told.",

            "content": "I am typically hesitant to even begin decently long shonen series. They tend to be filled with flaws that reflect lazy writing for the sake of length, unfortunately. From huge casts of characters, ranging from the barely touched upon yet interesting side characters to the incredibly dull main characters who receive much more than their fair share of exposure. On top of that, there are occasionally long stretches of boring developments or slow pacing to keep the content running. Very often these lengthy series become too stagnant and similar to itself, leading me to feeling the need to take breaks from the show simply becauseI need to experience something in any way different for once. Last but not least, the ending is very rarely satisfying, leaving me wishing I had spent my time on a series that could end itself without so many bumps in the road.\\n\\n\r\nCross Game has none of those problems, and that is why it is a series that will be remembered.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, as most will immediately assume based on what they may see about the show before viewing it, Cross Game appears to be a baseball anime. However, that presumption is a mistake \u2013 is a show that involves baseball, but it isn\u2019t about baseball. Baseball is the lowest common denominator that ties almost every character to each other, and it is the driving force that provides the challenges and rivals that keeps the characters aiming higher. This drive and determination is a theme that is played out in a very classic shonen way, but Cross Game plays its cards just right by keeping the work, successes, and failures relatable to anyone. This is achieved by keeping the focus not on the baseball itself but on the characters and how they react to and deal with the significant baseball-related events as they occur, allowing the story to stay easily understandable and interesting to even non-sports fans.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say that there is no baseball in the series, quite the opposite in fact. However, the games that are focused on are limited to the most important, intense ones that keep the viewer on their toes while being easy to follow for the non-sports fan. The baseball fans in the audience need not be turned away by the comparatively sparse amount of actual playing, though. Since the viewers who aren\u2019t into baseball won\u2019t need to be entertained by antics or extravagant special moves, Cross Game\u2019s take on the game of baseball is realistic and fun for purists who just want a good game of baseball. Both sets of viewers will easily be able to understand how the game keeps the world of Cross Game turning.\\n\\n\r\nCross Game also knows where to put its attention when it comes to the characters. The cast is kept decently small and focused, allowing for as much growth and screen time as possible for the most important characters. The people who will be mainstays are made clear early on, allowing for introductions to take as little time as possible to give way for optimal development. Of the main cast, there are no flat characters, and with the diversity of the roster it is a rare moment to become tired of what the series has to offer. On top of their contributions to the story, each character also provides a unique atmosphere and sense of humor to the scenes they are involved in, keeping the show fresh and on its toes at all times. The cast deals with basic themes of life, death, and love, but each in their own different stride, bringing an interesting dynamic of how long it takes individual characters to cope with certain situations while also interacting with each other on a daily basis. This all leads to a small, well-developed lineup of characters that are all memorable, and that cast itself is quite possibly the strongest asset Cross Game has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nAs the saying goes, the real beauty is in the journey, not the destination, and Cross Game recognizes and relishes in this fact. In terms of plot twists or surprise advancements in the relationships, there are very few if any. The turns and twists the story takes are, for the most part, what many would describe as unsurprising or clich\u00e9. In the case of Cross Game, though, this is definitely not a negative. From the results of games to the status of relationships, Cross Game takes the most natural progression without attempting to insert unnecessary drama or convoluted twists, and it works perfectly without either of those because the story simply doesn\u2019t need them to stay both entertaining and lovely.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, animation, and even art are all simple and to the point. The retro-feel of the art with the more modern animation style gives a sort of \u201cremastered\u201d feeling to the viewer, complimenting the traditional standards and themes Cross Game makes a point to keep intact. The opening never changes and, while never exactly fitting the state the story is in at any given point in time, is just ambiguous enough to keep a certain relaxed mood in mind for each episode. The endings are never terrible but simply not memorable. The single exception is the first ending, which incorporates itself into the first episode in a beautiful and melancholy way that successfully set the tone for the entire next forty-nine episodes to come. If nothing else, that moment is one that will stick around in many viewers\u2019 memories as possibly the most emotionally powerful scene of the entire series, and that in itself is worth something significant.\\n\\n\r\nCross Game is not the most intellectually compelling anime you will ever watch. It doesn\u2019t delve deeply into subjects, and it never leaves a certain comfort zone when discussing more tender subjects. It doesn\u2019t have groundbreaking characters or a surprising story with exciting cliffhangers. It is fully aware, however, that those things don\u2019t matter if the execution isn\u2019t just right, and that shows bright as day. Thus, Cross Game\u2019s simplicity is also its beauty, standing as an instant classic and a coming-of-age story that will be looked upon as one of the greats someday by the power of its small successes and incredibly human characters.",

            "content": "My first impression of this show was \"another sport-themed anime? \u00ac\u00ac\". yeah i was expecting something like prince of tennis or captain tsubasa with baseball (you know, naturally impossible balls and over reacting of the game). it comes out that i was wrong.\r\nThis anime more than centering on just baseball, gives a great enphasis in friendship, values and, of course, romance. The techniques are not unnatural, there are no super curve balls or balls that gets in flames and destroy the other one's bat. instead this is a relaxing and ejoyable anime with a slow pace.\r\nThis means that its great if you are not searchingfor epicness or heart breaking anime but a quite \"awwww\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe story is simple but it develops very well. It manages to get some twits that you would never expect and overall there are no real fillers so its pretty much 50 episodes of story. (it sounds to much for an anime but believe me, you will want more)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nOne of the aspects that make me consider not watching it. Sometimes i feel the drawings are a little bit deformed and the animation is a little bit old. however the it is pertty fluid and that helps a lot for the baseball match to look great. its just matter to getting use to it.\\n\\n\r\nsound: 8/10\\n\r\nNot epic but good. didn't like the ending, the op was just fine but there were two songs that were pretty good. nothing more to say.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is why i loved the series, the characters are just so well developed you actually get very identified with them. You can understand them without having to explain it verbaly. there is a great variety of characters and each of them is instresting in their own way (exept for senda, over-anoyed me sometimes). i would say this is the strongest point in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\ni got pretty stuck with the series, again i really enjoyed it so pretty selfexplanatory rating. this series manages to give you exitement, laughts and tears in a very light way. good to rest from those shocking animes :)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, don't watch this series if you are searching for shocking OMG AWSOME ADICTING UBER EPIC anime that will leave you traumatized for a week. \\n\\n\r\nhope this review has help you!",

            "content": "When we group up, everything that defines us as a person is brought into question. This could be our ideals, passions, hobbies, relationships with others and many aspects that make us, well, us. This is part of the reason why as we grow up, we end up remembering our childhood or high school lives in such a bittersweet fashion. It is this period of our life that defines us so much as people, where we look at things that defined us in the past, and where we decide whether to keep them or discard them.\r\nOf course, this is not a difficult subject to write aboutor even make the audience relate to. Writing a story involving such a theme isn't difficult, since there really isn't much to do. The problem is, however, that writing characters centered around this theme is difficult. Since they are not defined by the setting, there's only so far you can go with writing characters around whatever the setting is. The key is, the characters have to feel and act human, not necessarily be complex (hell, in this kind of story, simplicity is probably the way to go). Problem is, a lot of writers sink into the melodrama and overblown character trait trap, where they focus on one layer and make that define the character or be overly dramatic even when there is nothing to be dramatic about.\\n\\n\r\nCross Game doesn't do that. Cross Game is human. In fact, it's so human that I legitimately wondered at times whether I was watching fictional characters or actual human beings. Hell, I wondered whether or not the writer was writing his own life experience onto the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't particularly remarkable, but serves its job well. The sports element is hardly even present for most of the show, and the show succeeds where most sports anime fail; making us care about the people playing the sports rather than watching it just for the sports. This works exceptionally well, hell I'd argue the show is more slice-of-life and about people discussing sports or practicing than actually playing matches. This works exceptionally well, since the viewer is emotionally involved in what's happening and isn't watching, oh I don't know, a football getting kicked around, players celebrating and that being the end of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis wouldn't have worked without the characters. The characters are the driving force behind the show, and they never stop moving forward from the beginning to the end. I've spoken earlier on that they are human, and I cannot help but repeat myself; they are human.\\n\r\nThey don't take loss by crying and running screaming or trying to kill themselves or any other stupid reaction. They don't go crazy and act like it's the end of the world if they lose a baseball game. No, they feel depressed for a bit, then life goes on. The character interactions are excellent and the romance which is the driving force behind the show is developed with a ridiculous amount of subtlety and care, and never feels forced or unnatural.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is pleasant to look at and very distinct, though the animation quality is nothing particularly special to look at. The backgrounds are very simply done, but somehow feel very normal looking and does a good job in bringing the show to life. The animation is the weakest aspect of the show, not because it's bad, but because the show deserves better.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors never scream or act irrationally, and a lot of care went into all of their lines. The soundtrack is nothing remarkable, but fits the overall mood of the show and plays at the right time, meaning that it's never in the way of the viewer enjoying the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Cross Game is an excellent show that does an exceptional job in its human characters, extremely human characterization and it's hard not to walk out of this show smiling and feeling satisfied. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",

            "content": "I know its a dramatic score. But to me I've always loved the anime and drawing styles of touch and orange road.\r\nAt first I was skeptical, like with most baseball and sport animes. but cross game was different from the very start. after all how often do you see the girl you love die in the fist epiosde?\r\nThat first episode caught my attention fully. that beautiful scene of Kou realising how he should be feeling. the music everything drew me in instantly. It truly stirred up my emotions and it really made me feel like Kou in a way.\r\nUnfortunately I wasn't patient enough and decidedto read the manga up to nearly the final 4 episodes. So I never knew the ending till today\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say this anime, is not hard core baseball. it revolves the story around baseball and its characters. The speical moments the funny twists, and the personalitys of the characters. even the jokes are well placed.\\n\\n\r\nTe final match really had me feeling like I was on the mound, I felt exactly Like IKou did in the anime, my heart beating quickly, puming adrenaline throughout my body, my breathing slightly paced from pressure and my body being worn out by it.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself cheering him on, foundmy self Lost in the world infront of me.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched major, and though it is good. Cross game really has it all. Its a baseball anime and manga on a completely different level. that really gets to you with story action and muisc.\\n\\n\r\nI really want everyone to watch this, but I guess you first have to be slightly into baseball to enjoy it. ^_^. But yeah I loved it. Completely.\\n\\n\r\nThe way it draws me in is amazing. I really hope there would be a second season. but I know thre won't and deep inside I hope there won't because this is a work of art. The suspense really really gets to you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 ito me is the score it completely deserves. Which is hard to get. (esepcially since anime seems to have gone done a BIG Boob Road. :P)",

            "content": "\"A four leaf clover\"\r\nThe Story...\r\nThe story starts off with a dramatic scenes and continuously moving towards the main story. An introduction of a boy named Kitamura Kou. Along the way he will encounter some trials and changes in life, facing it and surpassing these kinds of problems he\u2019s encountering will be hard at start, but looking at the bright side might help him to keep moving. Finally, being a part of a baseball team is quite a change for him, but knowing that he got a talent from it, he strive to do better for his own will. After that, there is a girl whois quite close to him or kind of an acquaintance of his named Tsukishima Aoba. At start it is quite funny, but when she is close to Kou it\u2019s going to be quite an annoyance on her side.  A story between baseball team and these two will fill up some nice entertainment and brings a kind of twist to the story as it moves along.\\n\\n\r\nThe main attraction here would be having a soft, light, and balance flow of events about the drama, comedy, romance, and most probably about baseball. It focuses on how to accomplish the trials and encounters the story gets. Fulfilling a dream as an individual, a team, or for other sake will be added as it became an interesting plot. Since it involves sports, giving such determination and willingness to perform well in a game may be attractive as they put such tension and thrill into it. The development of the story is good since it has 50 episodes to watch. They focus on the flow of the main and other characters in the story while giving also a great impact to the main arc itself. It is a kind of development that is done slowly, little by little, arc by arc. Also putting a comedy and drama scene to the story gives something else for the viewers to be entertained of, for which to avoid boredom.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation...\\n\\n\r\nThe art & animation is great. The backgrounds, the sceneries, and other minor details on the story are surely detailed and have a radiant effect that appears on every episode of the series. As for the OP and ED theme, it definitely matches on the whole story itself. The characters are drawn in such a way that probably most children can appreciate, while it is animated based on its specific situation. All are well drawn and animated based on each scene which brings such nice feeling to the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nSound...\\n\\n\r\nA cheerful, lively, calm, and something deep BG music and sounds will be heard. It is a kind of sounds that surely bring pleasing effects throughout the story. Also both OP and ED songs here are something nice to hear as it gives soothing and attractive melody that is nicely suitable for the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters in this series give a lot of entertainment and add some interesting plot to the story. These three main which are Aoba, Kou, and Yuuhei, they may have some similarity on their traits, but deep inside of them they have some unique traits to tell. And for the supporting and other characters that appears throughout the show, they made it complete as they give meaning, laughter and drama to the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIt has a promising story to tell. A kind of anime that keeps you interested on the flow of the story. A story that gives something to laugh about and at the same time gives some drama to reminisce over. Adding such ideal art & animation to the story makes it truly fascinating; sounds that matches the theme and the traits of the characters that are nice to hear; and characters that supports the story makes it even worthy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOn its concept and development of the story, it is nice to have as it has a well balanced atmosphere between sports, romance, and comedy. It is a series that includes such wonderful art that affects the overall image of the story, an animation that matches the traits and delivery of each character, and sounds that helps to add some feelings to the show. It\u2019s quite a nice mix of these as they make a wonderful story to tell.",

Even still, I find it hard to not write a bit about this anime Cross Game, even after two weeks of watching it.\r\nFrom what you can read from the synopsis, the story is about a boy, Kou, who had a childhood love with a girl Wakaba, one of four sisters who run a small family batting center/cafe in with their father.\r\nIt actually starts after the first episode (you'll see what I mean.....), and what you will experience is something you probably never have before.In general the anime may appear to be a simple slice of life story in a baseball setting on the surface with a predictable theme or overlying plot, but Cross Game will send all your expectations you may have from what you assume from the first episodes out of the BALL PARK. You WILL be proven wrong. You'll witness some of the most believable characters you'll EVER see in an anime.... I can guarantee you that. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it a home run (no pun intended), are mainly the interpersonal relationships between all the characters, the beautiful art from the classic manga writer Adachi, and the amazing OST. \\n\\n\r\nThis series needs so much more attention because it doesn't have all the cliche anime tropes or the sleek, modern anime art style we're all so used to now. But even then, if it's in your plan to watch, PLEASE WATCH IT NOW.  I don't hand out 10's very easily, let alone write reviews, but this series deserves it. You WILL have a great anime completed after finishing this masterpiece.",

            "content": "Ahhh Cross Game, in my opinion a very unique hidden gem in the pile of generic anime that has been coming out. This is one of the more authentic, pure and relaxing animes I have ever watched and definitely one that score on my top 10. The realism and charm of the characters is simply captivating.\r\nTo begin my review i would like to say that i don't play baseball and i barely know the rules. I usually never watched sports anime and for those shows that i watched none of them score among my favorite but this one. Cross Game is much more than asport anime and do not rely on unreal and exaggerated effects like say, prince of tennis.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great, the art is simple yet effective where it needs to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very straight forward and simple. As i said this is a relaxing anime although the games do manage to get you to the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nWhat it's truly outstanding in my opinion are the characters. 90% of the anime out there now are played by characters that are just unreal. Cross game, however, manages to deliver great characters that you can identify yourself. Aoba in my opinion is the of the more authentic tsunderes you will find and kou is not a blind guy like most animes do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall give this anime a chance unless you strictly want action and blood. Cross game is just an anime that will make you smile, root for their team and cry. Right of the bat i kicks of with a strong plot and there will be cliffhangers through the series that will make the 50 episodes pass with a breeze. it does gets a little bit slow towards the middle but i think 50 episodes is a great number and there is hardly any filler.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i enjoy this series a lot the humor is great and it one of those animes that leave you with a bittersweet feeling since it leaves you wanting for more but you know that the ending was perfect was it was.",

            "content": "[A spoiler-free Review]\r\nI was recommended this anime a lot of times and I had read a lot of reviews of it before watching the anime which led me to expect a lot from it. And fortunately, it certainly did meet my expectation if not, exceeded it. \r\nAdapted from a manga series by Adachi Michiru, Cross game is a romantic comedy sports (baseball) anime series made by SynergySP studio which has also produced some hits like \u201cHayate no Gotoku!\u201d. Although superficially, it looks like just another sports anime, its main forte lies in how characters develop their relationships rather than the baseball itself. And the interactionsof characters are portrayed so finely that you can pleasingly watch it the whole day without being bored in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nTalk about the plot. Cross game has a very simple and usual plot like any other baseball series: some high-schoolers dream of reaching koushien, where a national high-school baseball tournament is held. Well, I have no complaints here, though. After all, it does set up a good setting for the characters to develop and blend very well among themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime starts off showing the protagonist, Kitamoura Kou, in middle school. Probably due to proximity, his family has very good relations with Tsukishima family thus making their children also very close to each other. Unexpectedly, one day, Adachi\u2019s trademark \u2018tragedy\u2019 storms into their peaceful lives, which then opens up a way to an actual story which follows after 4 years of the previously shown time \u2013 meaning Kou is a high-schooler now! It is a pretty powerful start albeit probably not original, which draws the viewers into the story from the get-go.\\n\\n\r\nThe main allure of this series is the characterization.  Every single character is given a fair enough of screen time to depict his/her traits and the viewers can\u2019t help getting attached to the characters. The pace of the story is slow but it\u2019s actually because of that, the characters are able to grow on the viewers and become so memorable. However, this might be a miss rather than a hit to those who are more into fast paced action-packed series. But again, it cannot be helped; a single series cannot cater to every type of viewers as some things can be polar opposite of each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe subtle depiction of the relationship between two main leads is always intriguing to watch. They never speak out their minds even until the very end of the anime. However, the expressions and emotions of them feel so natural and real that viewers can easily discern what they are thinking. It is very often said in the series itself by other characters that the two main leads are very much alike. And it is undoubtedly true in a sense that they both are very reluctant to show their true feelings and outwardly, keep a hate relations whilst still caring for each other in most situations. Also, some daily manners of them like drinking an out-of-date milk apathetically coincide. This makes their relations very intriguing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the series \u2013 romance is very nimbly hinted in the series. As I already said, two main leads don\u2019t openly admit their standings as a romantic couple. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t any development at all. Gradually but surely, the reticent behavior of their feelings for each other seems to be opened as time goes although the anime ends before the very end of its conclusion. And it is completely fine as the romance in this show isn\u2019t supposed to be taken to the extreme in the first place. It is just one of aspects, that embellishes the anime. So, viewers are not to expect a full-fledged romance from this series.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the two main leads, side characters also get to enjoy a pretty good amount of romance. Some love triangle also gets evolved; however, it is never taken to the extreme level keeping the series fairly simple and relaxing. From an unrequited love to a successful one, the anime presents both of them in quite an elegant manner. The best thing is: the drama in this series is never overly exaggerated yet evokes the powerful emotional feelings in the viewers. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy part is just as great kept to a reasonably minimum level which perfectly suits the ambience. This may not get the viewers to laugh out loudly (as it is never intended to) but definitely ensures the viewer to form a smile throughout the comedy scene. It actually serves as a medium to keep the viewer busy from being too depressed from the emotional drama keeping the anime as relaxing and light-hearted as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the baseball part may not be the main focus of the series, it isn\u2019t of low quality at all. Prior to watching this series, I, myself wasn\u2019t much familiar with baseball but was still able to grasp what was going on to get on the edge of the baseball\u2019s thriller. So, for those who are reluctant to watch this series because of baseball (sports), don\u2019t put this series aside without even trying just because you don\u2019t know baseball game.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and artwork is slightly above mediocre level. Some characters look almost same; it is sometimes hard to distinguish the character by the looks alone. However, although it is far from being able to give a stunning and awesome sense of aesthetics to the viewer, it is pretty much watchable and fairly consistent. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, the opening song, \u201cSummer Rain\u201d is somewhat catchy to at least make you not want to skip it. And while the first ending song didn\u2019t really catch my interest at all, the second and third ending song were more or less decent. The BGM (Background Music) especially, during the baseball game, is placed very rightly adding another level of exciting feeling while watching the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe only possible downside in the character is of Mizuki Asami. He doesn\u2019t have much role or any character development in the series. He is introduced as a love rival only to be ignored by the female lead. Or maybe, it\u2019s just me being not able to understand the author\u2019s intention of keeping this character in the cast. So, whether this is the downside or not is I cannot say with certainty. Nevertheless, even if it is one, it is not so significant to be an obstacle.\\n\\n\r\nSpanning 50 episodes, Cross game is a well thought-out series with very few flaws that are also overlookable. I enjoyed this anime so much that fifty episodes didn\u2019t feel long at all. Characters are so memorable and attachable that even weeks after watching it, whenever I think of Cross Game, I feel a sort-of warm nostalgic feeling.\\n\\n\r\nSimple yet, a very powerful emotion-invoking series full of likeable characters. It gets a whopping 10/10 from me.\\n\r\nRecommended for almost anyone to at least try this series. If you are looking for a relaxing light-hearted slice-of-life anime, then it is a plus.\\n\r\nAnd for those who are avoiding it because of the sports genre, don\u2019t do so. This series is more of a slice-of-life anime than the sports. After all, the sport is used just as a backbone to lay out the way for the plot to proceed.\\n",

            "content": "This is the first anime that I watched that was written by Mitsuru Adachi. I love baseball  anime so I give this one a chance, I never thought that I'll love it so much~ :D Just finished re-watching it for the third time.\r\nStory:\r\n\tHonestly, i was blown away by the first episode, what a very strong start for an anime. It  was all unexpected, Just the first episode and it already made me cry... The story was about the cat  and dog relationship of Kou and Aoba. Adachi-sensei used his usual pattern of story, the childhood friend route. With a lot of twist, surprise event and a roller coaster of emotion that you will like. We have comedy, romance, drama, Baseball action in one place. \\n\\n\r\n\tFirst, let\u2019s discuss comedy, Adachi-sensei never missed any opportunity to crack a joke, the very important thing about delivering a joke was the Timing and that was done perfectly. He will  happily use anyone or anything (old or new) as a punch line, so even its just an ordinary day you will find it funny and interesting. Next is Romance, the romance in the story isn\u2019t  rushed, you can see it develop little by little, with love triangle in every corner makes it interesting  so you can enjoy the love and hate relationship of the two protagonist until the end~. Drama, when Adachi-sensei put a drama in his work it become the key point of the story, just like what happened in the first episode, it will leave an impression until the end of story. Baseball action, Maybe because Adachi-sensei have his own baseball team that he can deliver such an exciting baseball game. He knows When and how to make incredible events to happen, totally surprising, that's why I love the baseball manga the he writes. \\n\\n\r\n\tAnother key point of the story is memories~ Every now and then you'll see a flashback in the story, well I didn't find it annoying, it plays a major role in the character development of the main characters. Sometimes those memories makes me teary.Ending, I'm somewhat contented with it, all the feelings was sorted out and finished the climax of the waited battle in the baseball tournament. Somewhat because i wish he continued it until koushien XD\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n\tIf u already read some of Adachi-sensei's manga you will find that all of his male protagonist has the same kind of character and i think same goes for the female. This time its Kitamura Kou, only son, cant even play catch ball till 5th grade, hard working and good at lying. The Ace Pitcher of the Seishu Academy, a typical character that you will like. Tsukishima Wakaba, same age, birthday and birthplace as Kou and love him more than anyone else. She plays a major role in the story despite of her status. Tsukishima Aoba, wakaba's little sister, who hates Kou very much and love Wakaba. If there's a word to describe her its \"Tsundere\". Kou's teacher about pitching. Very talented in Baseball despite of being a girl. Akaishi Osamu, position catcher, 5th batter and later the Captain of the Seishu baseball team. Like Kou he loves Wakaba too. Azuma Yuuhei, 1st base and the 4th batter and a talented one. He first appeared as an antagonist. He's emotionless when talking and only shows different emotion when playing baseball. Takigawa Akane, I'm really surprised of her appearance in the story, almost jaw dropping. The girl that moved next door and the daughter of the Soba Restaurant owner and a great painter. Her appearance takes the story to a new height.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\t\\n\r\n\tHere's another trademark of Adachi-sensei. Imagine a classic drawing and add modern day coloring and you will get a remastered feeling. His character design is all the same, specially the ears and the hair color were black, blond and brown. Same goes for the character faces, i had read in one of his manga that even Adachi-sensei criticize his own work for having the same face design for some character. Overall, the classic animation style that used in this anime was some-what refreshing if you want to escape the modern day animation style.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n\tThe Opening song \"Summer Rain\" really suits the anime, it gives the listener a tropical kind of beat, maybe because of the guitar. Good thing that they didn't replace it until the end of the series. The Ending song Koi Kogarete Mita Yume fit  perfectly to the 1st quarter of the season~ that slow and sad song can easily make u cry if added in the scene specially in the 1st episode~ The 2nd one is Orange Days, a Rap song, IMO it doesn't fit the anime, its not like the song is bad or anything, just that using a song like that in an anime with a classic style of animation isnt good. The 3rd  Moeru You na Koi Janai Kedo got a nice beat and  slow rhythm . And the last ED song is Rehersal, one of my favorite song. The piano is great and the lyrics too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n\tI really enjoy Cross Game. I laugh on the jabs, cries in the sad and touchy scenes and get caught in the suspense and excitement of baseball action. that you will ask for more. Well if you Want more baseball action, read H2 and Touch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 9/10\r\nCross Game is my first Adachi anime, and I was thoroughly impressed by its storytelling. The whole series is slow paced and filled with tension. Despite being somewhat predictable, Cross Game is well executed. There is only 1 filler episode out of 50, and even that episode tied pretty well into the main story. My only criticism is Adachi could have fleshed it out a little more, adding some more episodes. Yes this show already has 50 episodes, but it feels shorter than that.\r\nAnimation: 8/10\r\nI really liked the art from this show. It feels like an old school anime, and the nostalgic atmosphere itcreates serves it well. There were a few points in the show where the animation quality dipped. However, the no non-sense/frills animation was pretty consistent throughout its entirety.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nCross Game\u2019s cast is one of the most memorable in all of anime (that I have watched at least). Each character is developed so well that there isn\u2019t really a character that you won\u2019t like. In fact, you will really sympathize with the main cast\u2019s struggles, hardships, and triumphs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI loved the OP and the first ED. The next few ED\u2019s are great, but not as powerfully moving as the first one. The first ED \u201cKoi Kogarete Mita Yume\u201d is a beautiful song in its own right, but coupled with this anime, it really could not be more perfect. The OP \u201cSummer Rain\u201d is another song that really speaks volumes about the show and instantly feels like a classic. Finally the soundtrack is wonderfully arranged and really adds to the tension/excitement of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI\u2019m not really a big fan of baseball and when I started this show I was a little hesitant, but I had heard great things about it. From the start, the show hooked me in and never dropped the ball. Easily one of the best slice of life shows I\u2019ve seen (one of the best anime\u2019s I\u2019ve seen for that matter), so I highly recommend this show to others. If you can get past its animation (for some, that\u2019s the weakest part of the show), you will be rewarded with a classic.\\n\\n\r\nAverage Series Rating: 9.4 - Classic\\n",

            "content": "\u201cSimple is best.\u201d\r\n-Coach Maeno\r\nOne of the most common misconceptions viewers have regarding any form of media is something I call the \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d phenomenon. That is, if something similar has been done before, chances are the viewer will form a set of judgmental comparisons and criteria to be matched. This leads to the unrealistic expectation that equates to the viewer expecting some sort of literary revolution, only looking forward without truly embracing what the present has to offer. Adachi Mitsuru\u2019s Cross Game accepts its genre boundaries, and relies on the deftness of its storytelling and the depth of its characterization to keep youwanting more. \\n\\n\r\nKitamura Ko is the only son of Kitamura Sports Shop, whose apathetic nature belies his immense potential as a baseball player. Living down the street from Tsukishima Batting Center, home to its four sisters, Ko\u2019s family has formed a long-lasting relationship with the Tsukishima\u2019s. This bond is strengthened by the fated pair, Ko and the Tsukishima\u2019s second oldest, Wakaba, both being born on the same day in the same hospital. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost immediately, Adachi throws a tragic curveball to the viewer, to which he first displays his skillful handling of his story. With such heavy dramatic potential in just the first episode alone, Adachi carefully utilizes this opportunity to not throw away his setup in favor of melodrama, but instead capitalize on creating a human connection between the characters and the viewers. This connection cements the foundation for a strong cast of personalities, led by Ko and the Tsukishima\u2019s third sister, Aoba. \\n\\n\r\nThe two protagonists are startlingly similar, and Adachi builds the pair up like two halves of a perfect whole. Despite Aoba\u2019s generally spiteful attitude towards Ko and his reluctant acceptance of her continual ridicule, the exchanges between the two do not detract from their development, but instead define its progression. Additionally, a further romantic element is introduced, which adds a dramatic tone that quickens the story\u2019s pacing towards their lives in Seishu High School and their dreams of aiming for Koshien, while introducing human complexities and relationships that are surprisingly, never overdramatized. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, to assume the depth of characterization stops with the protagonists would be a major mistake. Perhaps the most interesting character besides the leading pair is Akaishi Osamu, a childhood friend to Ko. Eventually named team captain to Seishu\u2019s baseball team, Akaishi\u2019s personality and decisions throughout the series draw a heavy emotional connection not expected of side characters, especially in sports anime that typically focus only on the protagonists. A whole slew of other characters are also given some time to shine, from Seishu\u2019s cleanup hitter, Azuma Yuhei, to the team\u2019s former manager, Shidou Risa. Each character opts to stay true to who they are, while developing as a result of the progression of the story. Adachi embraces the notion that people never completely change who they are, but they do make adjustments to make better of their lives. \\n\\n\r\nOutside of the drama and relationships is a generally lighthearted dialogue that surrounds a rather typical formula to get to Koshien, Japan\u2019s High School baseball championship. The progression of Seishu\u2019s baseball team and Aoba\u2019s struggle to continue baseball despite not being able to participate in official games become key plot points that seamlessly intertwine with consistent character interaction defined by Adachi\u2019s keen sense of humor. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of humor, jokes are masterfully timed and clever, despite seeming clich\u00e9 from time to time. The juxtaposition of the serious and the blithe is a tone not seen pulled off correctly too often in anime, but Cross Game is able to nail it almost every time, making sure each joke is cracked just the right number of times and at the right time too. However, the frivolity of their banter is not wasted either. Even the lightest of jokes serves a purpose to further an emotional connection between the character and the audience, and as the series progresses, the viewer will find him or herself laughing or crying along with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the actual baseball in the series, there is definitely plenty of it, and the games are done very well. One does not have to be a fan of baseball to simply enjoy the timely suspense of a close game, and unlike most other sports anime, the series doesn\u2019t sell out on creating unrealistic situations or miracle comebacks to keep the viewer at the edge of her seat. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of Cross Game is slow for a sports anime, but well-executed. The three major twists in the series are timed perfectly, which adds a sense of believability, for coincidences in life do occur, but not constantly. While relationships between characters may seem to grow complex, the foundation of the series remains rather simple and true to itself. For this series to be labeled as a \u201cdrama\u201d is definitely justified, but a bit of an overstatement. It carries many slice of life elements and ultimately is a feel-good experience, but the sheer variety of what it has to offer extends beyond a simple genre label.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that\u2019s not to say that the series is flaw-free either. With a decent amount of characters spanning 50 episodes, one can\u2019t help but to ask for just a bit more from a few more characters. There were many lovable personalities throughout the series, and while some continued to develop, others like Nakanishi or Senda could have had some more time dedicated to them, seeing how they were both constants throughout the series.  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is relatively consistent throughout the show. Released in 2009 by SynergySP, Cross Game definitely isn\u2019t one of the top shows in the animation department; however, the series definitely wins some points with its charm in character design. Even though the art style might not seem too refined, it is easy to grow onto, and within a dozen episodes, one will hardly notice any huge complaints in that department. \\n\\n\r\nOne step above the animation is the quality of Cross Game\u2019s soundtrack and voice acting. While there isn\u2019t anything in particular that stands out about the voice acting, Irino Miyu\u2019s Kitamura Kou and Tomatsu Haruka\u2019s Tsukishima Aoba were a fine lead pair. The true standout of Cross Game\u2019s sound set was its OST, which includes several tracks that were awe-inspiring when played alongside certain scenes. However, the OST probably was not used to its full potential mostly because the most captivating tracks were saved for the grandest moments, and most of the series consisted of lighthearted moments with lighthearted tunes to match it. The only opening of the series, Summer Rain, was an excellent choice to carry the series through 50 whole episodes. The first ending, Koi Kogarete Mita Yume, was my personal favorite and a highly emotional ballad. The other endings were all solid with their own respects. \\n\\n\r\nThey say to never judge a book by its cover, and Cross Game is an excellent example that supports this time-worn metaphor. Underneath a genre filled with complexities and controversy, Cross Game flourishes with a simple tale to tell, and it\u2019s given a lengthy amount of time to do so. Unhurried, yet engaging \u2013 simple, but beautiful \u2013 Cross Game was an emotional and memorable experience that has undoubtedly been the best Sports-related anime I\u2019ve watched thus far. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Version\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\n+ Charming design\\n\r\n+ Consistent animation\\n\r\n-  Nothing too special \\n\r\n-  A few gaffes in animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\r\n+ Extensive cast that is believably human\\n\r\n+ Heavy emotional connection\\n\r\n+ Excellent Development\\n\r\n+ Does not fall victim to repetitive tropes\\n\r\n-  Some characters could\u2019ve used more attention\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\n+ Excellent OST and op/ed sequences\\n\r\n+ Solid voice acting\\n\r\n-  Some wasted potential in soundtrack usage\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\n+ Engaging story that is simple at heart\\n\r\n+ Nearly perfect pacing that always keeps the viewer at the edge of her seat\\n\r\n+ Highly entertaining baseball games\\n\r\n+ Mixes well with characters\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.3/10, Highly recommended for anyone to give a try.

            "content": "Cross Game is a very special show. Unlike most shows today, Cross Game is treats both its characters and the audience with respect. On paper, it looks to be yet another baseball series, but it shines as a rare gem of the genre.\r\nThe most significant difference between Cross Game and other sports shows is its willingness to portray the characters outside the sport - showing who they are as people - what they care about, what they like, who they are. Cross game is really more of a slice of life rather than a sports show - There are often long periods of extended sliceof life sequences wherein all we see are the characters going about living their daily lives, something unheard of in most shows which rush to showcase the exciting and hot-blooded sports action. This is a testament to the strengths of the show, trusting in its stellar character writing to carry itself.\\n\\n\r\nI earlier mentioned that this shows treats its characters with respect. That is easily the most charming part of the show. Gone are the ridiculous slapstick sequences or the completely ridiculous and convenient misunderstandings that occur because a character decided to act completely against his or her pre-established personality and motivations. Cross Game takes the time it needs to develop its characters, allowing us to slowly know them as we watch them go through their daily lives, through their interactions with the other characters and through a large number of well-placed flashbacks. This allows them to grow beyond the typical traditional character archetypes, with every character given the space and time needed to develop and grow.\\n\\n\r\nThe past plays an important role in the show. We start off the series with an extended prologue of sorts, going back to the past when our characters were children. It covers a certain event which has huge implications on the characters, as well as giving us a glimpse of the personalities of the characters, and an idea of who they are. This allows us to see how they have changed with the passage of time, and how the event has affected them. It sets the tone for the rest of the series, and is an amazing pilot which serves to capture your attention.\\n\\n\r\nI also mentioned that the show treats its audience with respect. What I mean by this is that it is not a show which feels the need to explicitly state what the characters are feeling through narration, which can oftentimes be a very clunky tool. We never get into the characters heads where they outright say what they feel, but we always know what they are feeling and what they are thinking by virtue of the stellar direction. It is a very subtle show that constantly gives hints about what the characters are thinking, trusting in the audience to interpret those signs. It is a show wherein a simple look, laugh, or a word can mean much more than a whole episode of dialogue in a typical show.\\n\\n\r\nYou might have noticed that I have said little about what is thought of as the meat of the story - baseball. This is simply because the baseball takes a backseat to the characters. You don't watch this show for the baseball - it is honestly nothing special and there are certainly much better shows out there. The segments are competent enough and are usually exciting to watch, but it is merely well-done, and nothing too special. And that's perfectly fine for the series - it really isn't about the baseball. The baseball is simply the backdrop for the series, and never the true focus of the series. This means that you should really watch this show even if don't typically enjoy the sports genre - what Cross Game brings to the table is a highly unique experience that everyone can enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values of the show are sadly nothing to write home about, and the art and animation of the show is nothing special. This is perfectly fine though for a 50 episode series, and whilst not outstanding, is certainly suitable for the show. Where it excels in is its stellar soundtrack - containing many strong pieces that are well-used. Of particular note is the first ED, which perfectly sets the tone for the series and is used masterfully in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Cross Game is a show that you really should watch. It is through and through a character work, one which prioritizes the growth of its characters over everything else. This means that it doesn't really have a point or a lesson to drive home, and is simply a simple story about a group of people. But what makes it a great is the painstaking effort and love put into them, turning it from a simple story to an emotionally powerful masterpiece.",

            "content": "Well, I will say first of all that both this manga and anime are perfectly nice, perfectly pleasant, and probably perfectly enjoyable for a lot of people. It is all smiles (except for Aoba who is, you know, completely incapable of anything but frowning or looks of indignation), all optimism, and simple but sweet. Unfortunately, that keeps it from being very good either.\r\nThe story is your typical \"gets one star, enjoys a meteoric rise to the near top, loses anyway, probably eventually wins but ONLY in the very last year\" formula. Typical to this, ONLY the protagonists and \"notable\" opponents ever in ANY way matter.The only real gags in the entire anime revolve the few times they do not have the protagonists/notables easily succeed...which is not a very good gag element. The only real change to the overall plot tendencies is that they throw in a tragedy, and the tragedy is not a very good one...having to see people get all sadfaced and wax nostalgic about it is pretty annoying, and the onslaught of flashbacks repeated, while not as bad as it could be, is fairly overboard.\\n\\n\r\nTo the actual baseball parts of the action, since pretty much the largest negative emotions it displays are an \"oi oi oi\" \"are you kidding me\" attitude, there are not really any sore losers or sore winners. I know that the cliche \"big personalities! ridiculous action!\" shounens are not that great either, but all this manages to produce is a baseball team with no personality, taking matters to the other extreme. The baseball games are never really interesting because of this, and there is no real reason to sympathize with the team and want it to win no matter how much time they spend on all of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty weak. It is nice that Ko is not a brat, but he is also pretty bland, having no real personality to speak of...this goes for a lot of characters, probably everyone but Aoba really. Their personalities are pretty much all \"stare around thoughtfully/at another person, crack a smile, play baseball\". I appreciate that they wanted to use silence to set some sort of tone, but they failed to craft any meaningful personalities because of it. Unfortunately, Aoba is your standard grade unenjoyable tsundere who does NOTHING but complain and lie about her \"true feelings\" for 50 episodes, so she is not a good break from all of this at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a nice style, but it has some major problems. The character art becomes very chunky and bold in a lot of zoom ins for some reason, despite having previously looked fine zoomed out just seconds before. The next biggest problem are the mouths, which are some of the least expressive I have ever seen in an anime...just because you chose a simple style does not mean you have to totally cop out of drawing faces! They pretty much are just a barely open o ( or closed | all of the time. The other biggest flaw with the art is the coloring - everything is vivid, but nothing actually has any detail! Pay attention and you will notice this is true...it does not ruin the anime, but it makes it difficult to find much interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very smooth most of the time, a real treat to watch actually, but it also deals in most of the major problems of modern anime. It has a ton of slow zoom ins on characters to simulate movement that is not there. It has tons of white action lines to simulate false excitement in the sports scenes (no idea why, they ACTUALLY decently animate most of the time, so why do this?) - this happens more as the anime goes on, initially it was rare. There are lots of repeat moments (as in triple takes et cetera), lots of white outs during action scenes to try to draw out and create a bigger impact, and other various tricks that really fall flat...again, it is not bad enough to destroy the in episode pacing or destroy the \"feel\", but it is overboard and slightly distracting.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is completely average, and the music is terrible and interferes with a lot of moments.\\n\\n\r\nA final miscellaneous flaw is that the transitions are incessant and really poorly done. Oftentimes they will flash to some random scenery and pan straight up, this happens literally about 30 times. Also literally about 30 times they will use the terribly drawn cat (worst part of this anime) to clumsily transition.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a decent sports anime/manga, but really I would say that not only are there better slice of lifes around, and alternately there are better hot blooded sports anime/manga around, and that I would fill my time with either of those alternatives first before looking to a work like this.",

            "content": "Cross Game is the latest story from Adachi to be animated.  Once again, Koshien rules!\r\nIf anyone has watched or read any of Adachi's previous stories (Touch, H2) than you will know what to expect: Great characters (albeit looking the same as ever!), a great story, lots of dry humor, and the ever-present dream of going to Koshien.  However, there are some subtle differences with this story and characters that I think make Cross Game Adachi's best work so far.  I'll get more in depth with that a little later.  On to some categories:\r\nArt/Animation - 7/10\r\nSome people may find the art alittle bland.  However, I am going to pretty much ignore the drawing style, as it is entirely based on Adachi's drawing style, and as he has been successful it it for a long time, there really is no need to address it.  However, his drawing style is mostly reflected on the character designs.  Other than that, the art is stunning, especially the clouds when they show the sky (which they do often). I will talk about the animation, though, which is what most of my score is based on.  Overall, the animation is fine, but it suffers somewhat because of the drawing style, which tends to produce bland looking animation.  It also seemed to me that the director took a look at the huge success of Touch and thought that they could copy some of the animation styles from that time, which also drags it down a little bit.  However, the animation is still crisp and lifelike, especially at crucial moments in the baseball games, which is where it probably needs the most focus, and they did a great job of that.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThey picked a good first opening song for this anime.  There is only one so far (Summer Rain) through 30 episodes, and I imagine there will be another one soon.  Summer Rain has a nice touch of acoustic guitar that leads into the rock song.  The band has a nice male singer with pretty good range. The opening animations are also very good.  The endings so far have been pretty good as well, although I don't listen to endings very much.  I like the second ending better than the first, but that pretty much all I have to say on that.  The background sound/music is also very good.  It reflects the tension very well during games, and is very good at setting the mood at the batting center and in homes as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the characters are the star of the show, and are the reason the premise behind Cross Game works.  Without good characters, there is no way anyone would want to keep reading and watching Adachi's works.\\n\\n\r\nThe hero of the story is Kou Kitamura, son of the owner of Kitamura Sports.  When we first meet him as a child and later as a middle-schooler, he is aloof and self-centered, but he shows flashes of competitiveness and compassion, which increase their presence in his character throughout the show and create a very likable hero.  His dream of making it to Koshien is based on Wakaba's dream of Kou pitching in the Koshien in front of a sellout crowd.\\n\\n\r\nThe next character to talk about is Tsukishima Wakaba.  Although she really is a minor character in terms of real-life presence, her influence is seen throughout the entire show and behind many of the motivations that the characters have.  Her death is a tear jerking one, and from then on, while she is not seen again in the real life of the characters, numerous flashbacks and memories that Kou, Aoba, and some others have of her remind us of her influence, sometimes to an annoying extent (although not very often).  Her character is almost perfect, and made more so because of her death, which I think is kind of lame in that there are no moments of Wakaba as anything other than a good girl.  She is always kind, beautiful but not conceited, and she only shows selfishness with her relationship with Kou.\\n\\n\r\nThe second main character and the heroine of the show is Tsukishima Aoba, the third daughter of the Tsukishima family.  Aoba is loves baseball and is fiercely competitive.  She was also jealous of Kou as he spent so much time with her older sister, Wakaba, and early on declares her dislike of Kou, though he doesn't seem to care.  Aoba's competitiveness never changes throughout the story, even though she knows she will never be able to play an official baseball game in high school.  Aoba and Kou are constantly at odds with each other, and provide great humor and banter in their encounters, which happen often as they live right next to each other.\\n\\n\r\nAkaishi Osamu is Kou's catcher and bats fifth.  He was tough guy at a young age, but after Wakaba died, who he liked, he became more considerate of others.  He also was the one who heard Wakaba's dream of Koshien, with Kou pitching, Akaishi catching, and Aoba in center field.  He, along with Kou fight to make Wakaba's dream come true. \\n\\n\r\nAzuma Yuuhei is the fourth batter of the Sheishu High team.  He was a star player in middle school who came to Sheishu because of a gathering of famous middle school players under a new coach who promised a trip to Koshien.  When the coach quit, most of the other players left, but he stayed behind, believing that Kou had what it took to reach Koshien.\\n\\n\r\nNakanishi Daiki is Kou's friend from childhood.  He was Kou's catcher throughout middle school, but moved to third base at Sheishu High.  He bats third.\\n\\n\r\nSenda Keiichirou is the shortstop and leadoff batter on the Sheishu High team.  He has a big ego and likes to act flashy, which the caoch calls \"perfect\" for a shortshop.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Cross Game flows in a laid back matter.  The motivations of each character are conveyed very smoothly and there are no real inconsistencies within the plot, which is reflective of Adachi's genius as a storyteller. The story sneaks up on you and begins to encompass you, whether you want to or not, and because the characters aren't so easy to figure out at times, it keeps you guessing as well, which keeps you engaged.   The only issues I have with the story is that the influence of Wakaba seems a bit too much, and she annoys me at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow the pace is a bit slow, and that may turn some people off, but this is no high profile action series.  This also isn't a comedy either, but it also doesn't become overly dramatic.  The show is character-driven and has virtually no plot holes, so, it doesn't become confusing, which often takes away enjoyment, especially with a drama like Cross Game is.  It's an interesting show to watch and the pacing of the show, as well as the right balance of action, comedy, and character development serve to ensure that you keep watching from one episode to the next.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the plot may be simplistic (Go to Koshien! Rah! Rah!) at times, Cross Game doesn't depend on a complex plot, as the show all about the characters than anything else. The main focus of the show, from beginning to end, are the characters. This is emphasized by the fact that the action and drama clearly take second place to each of the characters, and therein lies its genius.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:  9/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Many people perceive the combination of genres \"School\" \"Romance\" and \"Drama\" as usual \"stamps\" in the anime of the industry, and this is understandable, since often such shows are filled with a lot of banal events. Having started watching Cross Game, a skeptical viewer, most likely, will be pleasantly surprised. It is pleasant to realize that already the genre in which, it would seem, it is impossible to find anything new, there are some exceptions that not only make it interesting to watch what is happening, but also in certain events can surprise.\r\nStory tells about a boy named Kou Kitamura and four sisters of Tsukishimaliving with him in the neighborhood. The sisters are called Ichiyou, Wakaba, Aoba and Momiji. Wakaba and Kou were born on the same day in the same hospital. They are so close that Wakaba refers to Kou, as to his boyfriend, although Kou does not think so. Aoba, who is younger than Wakaba for a year, dislikes Kou for the fact that he, in her opinion, is trying to take her sister away from her. After, Kou and Aoba are gradually converging and are striving to realize the Wakaba dream - to see their play at the school championship on baseball, held at the stadium Koshien.\\n\\n\r\nCross Game is a story about a hard-working young man and a talented girl who is very fond of baseball. Without excessive pathos, with the charm inherent in the classic anime, this series tells about the most important things.  Story is relatively simple - like the plot of most films about human relationships. The series covers a rather large part of the narrative, it describes more than five years of life of the main characters. It should be noted that, with the \"Slice of life\" genre, every episode of the series looks with interest, the narrative does not break into events that are not necessary for the viewer. One of the main advantages of this series are the characters, let's move directly to them.\\n\\n\r\nAs it should be, in the works of Adachi, his certain style of art is preserved and it is on him that should be paid the main attention. Thanks to his own style of drawing, such amazing characters are obtained. Simply painted on the outside, similar in appearance to each other characters, inside are very deeply worked out, which causes a pleasant surprise. \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the narrative, Kou is a fifth-grade pupil of primary school, and later goes to Seishuu High School. Since his childhood, he spends a lot of time with Wakaba, and their families look at them as if they were a couple. He does not show outsiders his interest in baseball and regularly trains in the center of Tsukishima, he began training since he learned to hold a baseball bat. The series tells not only his story: the plot is divided roughly equally between him and Aoba, whose interests are incredibly similar. Aoba is the third daughter in Tsukishima's family, she is one year younger than Kou and Wakaba. She a tomboy, very fond of baseball. When she was little, her father often played ball with her, and so she became a strong pitcher. Mysterious Kou and energetic, persistent, mocking Aoba. These characters give two visions of the same story. Kou externally amused and carefree, whatever events happen to him. But in fact, these events worry and upset him more than others. Noisy behavior Aoba is just a mask, she understands that thanks to this no one will hear what she really wants to say. This plays into her hands, because she prefers not to give out her true thoughts and feelings. In this series, characters can play a crucial role, almost not appearing on the screen. For example, Wakaba is not the main character, but her role is very important, in connection with what she means for the main characters. The genius of the series lies in the interactions of the characters, it is they who create such a living atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nInteraction of secondary characters, also performed at a high level. Here will not be stamped characters for waste of screen time. Every character will disclosed enough to make you remember them. This is surprising, because, as mentioned earlier, from such genres you usually expect standard stamp-characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt is worth paying attention to the humor. It is very important to present it at a certain moment. The main thing in humor - this is the right time for filing, with which Cross Game handles perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound and music, everything is done at the highest level here. Soundtracks perfectly match the atmosphere of the show. Energetic and cheerful sounds, at some point in the series can be replaced by sad and melancholy pianos, which perfectly convey the mental state of characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, the anime has a sport genre, which is one of the most interesting, as it always \"unties the hands\" of the creators. Due to his correct representation, he constantly keeps the viewer in suspense. That is, in addition to the personal relations of the characters, the viewer is also interested with the sports component, since the combination of the two genres \"Slice of life\" and \"Sport\" is just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSo, how much on your memory do you remember such kind, unpredictable and touching stories? How many times have you been given the opportunity to follow the story of the character since his childhood, and so that it was interesting? Cross Game having a simple look, with a kind of banal genres, completely inverts the notion of them. This is new word in the anime industry, to repeat such an ideal combination of genres will be very difficult.  Also, with confidence, I can say that even if you are not a big fan of baseball (or not at all fond of them), you will still be interested in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the best sports romance of all time. Take time for Cross Game.\\n",

            "content": "When I think of Cross Game, I can't help but smile. It is without a doubt my current favorite slice of life anime. Those turned off by sports series need to look past that when picking up Cross Game. While baseball is a huge part of the series, the relationships between the characters is the biggest part of what makes it amazing. Baseball is simply apart of their lives. Those who enjoy character heavy slice of life anime will feel right at home with Cross Game.\r\n--\r\nStory and Characters:\r\nCross Game's story is a beautiful blending life's two wonders -- drama and comedy. While the comedy issubtle and often unspoken, it fits perfectly into the situations, making it a big part of the series' appeal. Adachi is a genius at progressing the story through more than just dialogue and physical action, but through the unspoken emotion given off by the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe many different relationships shared by the characters is the true wonder of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe cold, yet close relationship between Kou and Aoba is amazing to watch unfold throughout the series. In many ways I believe Aoba's cold attitude towards Kou stems not just from a jealousy of the time he spent with Wakaba, but from the fact that because she always liked him, she was jealous of the time Wakaba spent with him. Aoba knew Kou was a good guy, yet Wakaba loved him, so instead of getting closer to him and torturing herself, she decided to push him away with outward hate. And after Wakaba's death, she could have gotten closer to Kou, but the fact that he reminded her of Wakaba so much only fueled her outward feelings of disdain. \\n\\n\r\nThe other interesting relationship in the series was Kou and Akaishi. Akaishi seemed to hate Kou because of his relationship with Wakaba (much like Aoba), but instead of hating him after her death, he wanted to get closer and befriend Kou. This not only because of something Wakaba once said to him, but because being around Kou allowed him to be reminded of Wakaba.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plently of other character relationships that help add to the story, but those are two of the main ones I wanted to shed some light on.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Cross Game, like Adachi's other work, is simple, yet wonderful. The actual animation done is mostly the characters, with well drawn, but overall static backgrounds to support them. Despite this simplicity, the show appears beautiful with vibrant colors, leaving you with a light and good feeling.\\n\\n\r\nThe score throughout the show fits perfectly into each scene, with a pick up or drop in intensity when needed. The only opening theme of the show, Summer Rain, is one of my favorite ever in a series. It's one of those feel good songs that I looked forward to at the start of each episode. The various ending themes started with a rather melancholic song, yet allowed you to enjoy it while reflecting on the events of the past episode. From there the ending themes got a little more cheerful, evolving with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters' voices are virtually flawless, each matching the look and tone of their respective character perfectly no matter what the situation.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show probably more than any other anime I've ever viewed. It's just such a beautifully written and paced show with a wide variety of interesting characters that almost make you wish the show could go on forever. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned in my opening statement, don't be turned off by the sports genre stamped on this series. This is one of the best slice of life shows you'll ever see and turning a blind eye to it because it also happens to be about baseball is only doing yourself a injustice.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\n10/10 across the board.",

            "content": "Sometimes, simplicity is a beautiful thing. At the heart of \"Cross Game\" is a simple shounen story about baseball and romance. But even though it's the kind of story where you can roughly predict the ending within the first few episodes, there's never a dull moment. Heart warming, heart wrenching, beautiful in its simplicity... the joy of watching \"Cross Game\" comes not from its destination, but from the journey itself.\r\nDespite being a predictable story at its core, \"Cross Game\" begins in a way that is anything but predictable, featuring an early twist in the tale that no doubt comes as a big surprise to themajority of viewers. Because of this twist, \"Cross Game\" is not an anime that's easy to review, as the remainder of the series is built around this early key event, and it's nigh on impossible to go into details about a lot of the qualities \"Cross Game\" possesses - such as how it completely turns the conventions of character development on its head - without spoiling it. The twist itself is not only remarkable in its timing and its impact on the remainder of the story, but also in its dramatisation... or rather lack of. They would have been forgiven for making a meal of it on such an occasion, but instead it is handled in a surprisingly subtle and understated manner (in truth I actually found it to be a bit *too* understated). \\n\\n\r\nAnd in fact \"understated\" is a word that describes \"Cross Game\" perfectly as a whole. This is especially noteworthy considering it's a shounen, a genre famous for its flamboyant production. \"Cross Game\" barely uses any production gimmicks, as it goes about its business in a refreshingly quiet, down to earth manner. The rather plain art style, reflecting the low key dramatisation, is probably the weak link in the series. The lack of effort that can be seen in the excessive panning upwards towards the clouds (this is used so much it's almost like a running joke) and the sub-standard character designs (there are a lot of similar looking characters, and everyone have monkey ears) is likely to put off a lot of viewers. But you'll probably regret it if you completely ignore \"Cross Game\" just because of the unspectacular exterior. Because in all honesty, this is one of the most pleasant, likeable shows I've ever watched, and it's a travesty that not more people have seen it. \\n\\n\r\nI guess the other main reason a lot of people haven't tried \"Cross Game\" is because of its baseball tag. Now, I'm not particularly interested in nor knowledgeable about baseball, so I can't really comment much on the technical side of things, but the baseball part of \"Cross Game\" can still be enjoyed without too much knowledge about the game. As I've already stated, the anime doesn't heavily use the over the top embellishment omnipresent in shounen sports anime, and nor does it have a bad habit of dragging games out - even the longest games take just a couple of episodes to complete. More importantly though, baseball isn't crucial to enjoying \"Cross Game\". The fact that the source material is done by an author who is famous for his baseball mangas comes as a massive suprise to me, because if you haven't come across his other works before, like me, you would probably think that such an author would put more emphasis on baseball... but instead it plays second fiddle to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nBecause even more than baseball, \"Cross Game\" is about the chemistry between the members of the cast, and about growing up. Though it's arguable whether its shounen content prevents it from being a slice of life, there is no doubt that, in the very least, it shares a lot of the values with shows of that genre. There's often a strong sense of melancholy and nostalgia, and yet it's not a show that's shackled by the past - it's about moving on, and in fact it's the past the provides the inspiration for the characters to strive forward. A painstaking amount of attention has been given to fine-tuning the character interactions. The delicate nuances and countless metaphors and double meanings in the dialogues not only enriches the interchanges between the characters but also gives the show great rewatch value. It's easy to miss a few hidden meanings just by having a short lapse in concentration, and in fact there is so much subtlety in the dialogues that notable difference to the implied meanings can be drawn out just from watching different translations. In addition, \"Cross Game\" is also content with devoting a significant number of episodes concentrating on the mundane, every day stuff. The episodes about buying a birthday present, about valentines day, about taking care of someone who's caught a cold... it's actually these small but priceless distractions from the main plot that, along with its attention to details regarding character interactions, brings \"Cross Game\" to full bloom. \\n\\n\r\nKo Kitamura makes for quite an unusual main character, especially for a shounen anime. In fact he has most of the qualities normally reserved for an intriguing, dark horse type side character. Usually, the main character of a shounen anime comes in two flavours. The most common one being some level 1 loser who gets bullied a lot and who ceases to function in front of girls (Ippo from \"Hajime no Ippo\" being a classic case), and watching them improve is a bit like playing an RPG game, where you have to slowly grind up the levels. But occasionally you also have characters like Akagi from, er,  \"Akagi\", a badass anti-hero who is virtually untouchable from episode 1. Ko is not like either of those. Instead he's somewhere in between, and comes off as a mostly normal, believable character but with that extra something about him. He gets a headstart in terms of baseball skills, and within very few episodes shows himself to be quite a special player without the usual montages and \"level grinding\". Moreover, he doesn't start from the bottom of the social ladder either. He's popular in school, possesses a sharp sense of humour, a quiet air of confidence and maturity, and is incredibly dependable both on and off the baseball grounds. Even though baseball is important to him in a personal way, he's wise enough to recognise that there are far more important things in life, and would willingly give up all he has achieved in baseball at the drop of a hat if it can be exchanged away for those more important things. Out of the whole cast, he's probably also the one that's hardest to read - he doesn't show his emotions or thoughts easily, but not to the superhuman extent of the aforementioned Akagi. This makes him kinda enigmatic but in a believable way - most of the time, his casual exterior can fool everyone apart from those that are closest to him, but at the same time you can often make a good guess at what he's thinking from the subtle signs that he drops. What he does share with common main characters though, is his willingness to try hard, but he does this in a way that reminds me of a character from \"Planetes\" nicknamed Miss Swan. This nickname came about because like swans, she's all graceful and elegant on the surface, but underwater, she's padding away like crazy. A similar analogy can be applied to Ko, who, despite looking so calm and nonchalant all the time, is trying harder than almost anyone to reach his goals. And when it matters, there are few better people to put your trust in. All in all, like one the characters put it, \"Ko sure is a cool guy\". \\n\\n\r\nFrom the point of view of character development though, it's probably Aoba that takes the biscuit. She starts off in the anime as a baseball loving tomboy. In this anime there's probably no one who loves the game more than her, no one who puts in as much effort as she does, and no one who has to make as much sacrifices as she does. The tragic thing is that because she's a girl, she is unable to take part in the high school baseball tournament representing the school that she attends. But to see this as wasted effort is to undermine her the sacrifice she chooses to make later on in the series.\\n\\n\r\nKo and Aoba are both interesting in the their own right, but when they come together, they become the show's highlight. Aobo hates Ko from a young age because he always monopolised her sister Wakaba's attention whenever they're together... but also because of how similar her own personality is to Ko's - this is especially a problem considering their competitive streaks. It honestly is delightful watching the two of them clash over every little thing, uncanny to see their mutual understanding, and satisfying in the extreme to see the trust and mutual respect that grudgingly develop between them. Because of the remarkable similarity between them, by appreciating what makes Ko so great, Aoba also begins to appreciate her the strengths of her own personality.\\n\\n\r\nWakaba is another character worthy of note. Though sweet and innocent, she possesses a maturity and wisdom far beyond her years, and her strong personality inspires everyone whose lives she touched, bringing out their very best qualities. If she has any faults, it's that her character is probably designed *too* perfectly... but I guess this ties in with the simplicity that's the essence of this show. Wakaba inspires a great many characters in \"Cross Game\", but perhaps none more so than Akaishi, the big guy with the even bigger heart. He starts off as a common bully, but ends as an incredibly endearing, selfless character. There are other great characters found in support too, like Azuma, who we initially see as just a baseball player devoid of emotions and completely focused on winning. As the series progresses, he becomes more and more human underneath his unchanging expression. Oh yeah, and I love his dead pan, cutting one liners.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few characters I would like to have seen more of though, in particular Nakanishi and the baseball coach. I'd like to have seen more of Nakanishi because he played quite an important role in the early part of the series, and it's a shame that later on he becomes little more than a joke character both on and off the baseball grounds. As for the coach, his tactical know-how and knowledge about the game is said to be extraordinary, but as the show went on, this aspect seems to get neglected, and it felt more and more like Akaishi is the one running the show on the tactical side. Aoba's cousin Mizuki's presence also faded after the first few episodes, but unlike the others, I'd rather have seen less rather than more of him. He struck me as a bit of a redundant character, and I don't really know why he was introduced in the first place (although he is responsible for drawing out one of the most hilarious one liners in the series from Azuma).\\n\\n\r\nThese are all smallish problems though. The one big problem in the cast is Akane. Her appearance mid series threw a big spanner in the works, and I really didn't like that. Up until the point of her introduction, \"Cross Game\" is a very straight forward show (apart from the early twist), and it should have stayed that way. Akane's introduction feels like a Clannad-esq twist to complicate things. But thankfully, \"Cross Game\" is not \"Clannad\", and so does not take the cheap option that the latter most likely would have taken. In the end, none of the melodramatic endings that I was dreading came to pass. To be honest, the result rarely looked in doubt. It felt like Akane merely stalled things a little rather than knock them completely off track. In fact, she eventually becomes the catalyst, and is involved in some poignant scenes that helped to offset her introduction (which I think should never have happened).\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime approached its climax, key events starts coming in thick and fast, with almost every episode throwing up some significant development. These kind of got ruined by the previews though - they spoilt way too much for me. I often ended up watching an episode with great anticipation, only to find to my disappointment that the previews at the end of the previous episode had already picked out most if not all the choicest lines, leaving very little behind for me to discover for myself. So, if you're watching it for the first time, I highly recommend that you skip the previews.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, complaints about Akane and the previews aside, the second half of \"Cross Game\" is still really good overall. But as everyone knows, bad endings can marr an otherwise fantastic series. And when you boil down to the bare facts, the ending of \"Cross Game\" is a very simple and predictable one... and it just goes to show that the simplicity of an ending does not necessarily stop it from also being an incredible one. The last episode features a double climax that simultaneously hits the emotional apex both on and off the baseball field, followed by a gentle, blissful wind down in the second half. It's so simple, so beautiful, so satisfying, so perfect. \\n\\n\r\nIn this current era, \"Cross Game\" is a breath of fresh air, an anime that isn't hampered by cynical pandering nor reliant on melodrama and flashy production values. But despite its understated style and lack of gimmicks, it is as powerful as the best dramas and as addictive as the best shounens. And despite being a shounen, it's as human as the best slice of lifes and as sweet as the best shoujos. It's an anime that, while not seeming to be special in any way, ends up being oh so special.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nAs an aside, I'd like to talk a bit about the anime adaptation of \"Cross Game\". Unsurprisingly, \"Cross Game\" left a bit of a void in my life after I finished it, like I knew it would from just the first few episodes. This led me to follow up by reading through the manga, which allowed me to gain some insight into some of changes made during the anime adaptation. For the most part, the anime follows the manga pretty faithfully. A few subtle points are removed here and there, and other events are added in order to expand a chapter in the manga into a full episode. The two main changes though, are the way the anime reordered events to bring forward the early twist to be even earlier, and the expansion on Aoba's girls' baseball try out that only briefly gets mentioned in a single scene in the manga. Given the general result when anime studios try to mess around with the source material, it's normal to have certain reservations about changes. However, I honestly think that in the case of \"Cross Game\", most of the changes are made for the better. Changing the order of events allowed the anime to hit the ground running amongst other things, and fleshing out the girls baseball trials adds extra weight onto the decision made by Aoba later on in the series. The anime also enhanced the sweet and innocent feel of the work by removing most of the terribly inappropriate fan service that turned up on occasion in the manga. Add to this the competent voice acting and the music - who can forget the extended version of the first ending theme that was used to such potent effect - and you have yourself one very, very nice adaptation.",

            "content": "*Note: This review does not contain spoilers, but indirectly alludes to events that take place during the first episode*\r\n------\r\nWe all have ghosts. And if yours are of the variety that come from losing someone you love, this anime is about to take you on a ride you'll not soon forget. Don't let the younger characters and apparent focus on baseball catch you off-guard: This is a coming-of-age story about how a young ensemble cast reconcile themselves with a tragedy and their memories of what was lost, while finding themselves and each other along the way. Their quest for the Koshien masks this deeper goal, butthe baseball provides a fitting context to drive the character development, which is the heart of this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is not overly complicated, and the slow pace of the series might frustrate viewers who are more accustomed to action or plot-heavy series. This is definitely a slice-of-life anime, but it nevertheless manages to inject significant suspense elements, and balances its more serious themes with a healthy dose of comedy. However, unlike many series in the genre that tend to drift or take a lot of time to ground their characters and story elements, Cross Game front-loads its first episode and sets up a scenario that pulls at a viewer's heartstrings, drawing them in. The most significant criticism that can be leveled against it is that if you've seen Touch, you will find that Cross Game borrows heavily, even if it ultimately carves out its own path. On the bright side though, those who have not had the pleasure of enjoying Cross Game's older predecessor from the 1980s will have 101 more episodes of beautiful storytelling to look forward to. \\n\\n\r\nWith a *very* significant exception, the soundtrack is not particularly remarkable. The OP does invoke the feeling of lazy days of summer, and the quality of most of the ED's is pretty hit/miss. Having said that, the first ED is absolutely stunning and instead of feeling \"tacked on,\" integrates itself beautifully into the first episode - it's probably one of the most emotionally powerful uses of music you'll ever come across in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is simple and clean, but if you're looking for spectacular lighting effects or incredibly detailed designs, you won't find them here. At the same time, the style fits the series like a glove and the strong character development mitigates this to the point where you may not even notice the absence of flashy graphical effects. My experience was that despite its simplicity, small but significant art details had a strong effect - notable examples include the rusted-out and cold appearance of the Clover cafe/batting center contrasting with the warm personalities that inhabit the place, or the inherent symbolism in the series' trademark four-leaf clover with one petal colored a slightly lighter shade of green. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's the bottom line? Cross Game will make you cry. Then it will make you laugh. Then it will make you cry again. Along the way, you might find that you liked baseball a lot more than you thought you would. Most importantly, you'll love every minute. A must-see.",

            "content": "Writing a review over a sports anime is something I myself never expected to do but Cross Game is in a different league and deserved one. Sports anime generally stick with the basic formula of 1 person having amazing talent and taking a team by his/her hand and making it the best team there is, now if you read the synopsis you will have the same impression as you have with any sports anime however Cross Game(CG from here on) is not your usual sports anime.\r\nStory~10: As I mentioned above, CG seems to be your usual sports anime but right after the 1st episode itwill leave you in awe and shrugs off any bad expectations and will not give you the slightest opening to let you have them return, it was truly the best opening for an anime that I have seen so far. Every single time you think that it will be predictable, it surprises you.\\n\r\nCG has a nice flow and pace and before you know it you will have clicked on next episode for the whole day, don't let the 'all ages' rating turn you off, there is plenty of drama in the 1st episode already which made me even doubt that rating.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 50 episodes and usually what bothers me with animes that have 20+ episodes is that fillers will bump in, this is not the case with CG, there is 1 filler episode and even that is not really a filler, it adds to the anime in some way. Having that said, I actually wished that it would have lasted longer, the ending was alright but I have this urge to actually know how the whole tournament ended which is never shown though it was probably done so the viewer would go into their imagination world.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point that CG delivered well were the jokes, punchlines were everywhere and the comedy didn't come only from the supporting characters, it came from anyone, whether they were 1 episode flies or main characters. Something that should also be mentioned is the usage of flashbacks, they play a major role in this anime and they will explain some of the characters actions or their emotions, they were never bothersome and would always give an explanation.\\n\\n\r\nNow what is most important in a sports anime is of course the action or matches, they were always packed with tension and surprises, let me tell you that this is no anime with all super heroes that win every single match with a major difference in score, the results were always believable and the matches were astonishingly well made, the matches were truly matches that would make you root for them, at least I did and i'm sure I am not the only one who did. From what I heard the writer of the story is involved in the real baseball world, so it might explain a thing or two.\\n\\n\r\nArt~8: This is really something that bothered me at the start, huge ears is something you can't overlook and generally the hair style of some characters are what you could call weird or at least bothersome. Now you have to take into consideration that it is made for all ages, and you will eventually get used to it. The background is well done and emotions were well drawn out. What occurred to me was that the art actually got better the further you get into the episodes, so it is something you can look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nSound~9: Opening song is quite catchy and I myself never skipped it, it's just your usual J-Pop but an enjoyable 1. There are 5 different ending songs, all J-Pop as well, the last ending song (Koi Suru Otome by Natsuko Kondo) made the ending of the anime just that bit better.\\n\r\nBGM is almost never there, but when it was, it was blended well with the action on screen or just the right one to bring out the emotions better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters~10: There are 2 main characters and they have the relationship of childhood 'friends', why that is, is something you'll have to watch the anime for.\\n\r\nWe have Kitamura Kou, the male main protagonist and a promising pitcher who looked up to Tsukishima Aoba, the female protagonist, his reason for playing baseball is actually inspirable and will be explained, you guessed it, by memories. Both are likeable main protagonists and their relationship with each other will leave you laughing every now and then.\\n\r\nTsukishima Aoba is as I said the female main protagonist, she is Kou's pitching mentor and he has his form from her, she is in a male's baseball team which leaves her unable to play for them and always having to watch the game from the stands, the reason why she plays for them is already explained in the first couple of episodes and further explained as the episodes pass by.\\n\r\nI will briefly explain the most important supporting characters;\\n\r\nTsukishima Wakaba, Aoba's older sister and in love with Kitamura Kou, the main reason behind everything that happens and generally the main character in the memories.\\n\r\nAzuma Yuuhei, 4th batter for the team and able to hit near every ball that could be thrown, was an antagonist at the beginning but has reasons for changing, has sort of the advisory role in relationships.\\n\r\nTakigawa Akane, Akane puts the whole anime in a bullettrain and will leave you in awe, you will not see her appearance coming and is the switch that will put everything in motion.\\n\r\nAkaishi Osamu, the catcher and brain behind the team, was in love with Wakaba changed to a catcher from being a pitcher because of her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment~10, CG is truly a masterpiece and is nr48. on the ranking not for nothing, it has action, drama, comedy and tension in the matches and with some romance as well. It will have you in it's grisp straight after the first episode and will not let you go. I highly recommend CG to everyone, as it was inspiring and beautifully told.",

            "content": "I am typically hesitant to even begin decently long shonen series. They tend to be filled with flaws that reflect lazy writing for the sake of length, unfortunately. From huge casts of characters, ranging from the barely touched upon yet interesting side characters to the incredibly dull main characters who receive much more than their fair share of exposure. On top of that, there are occasionally long stretches of boring developments or slow pacing to keep the content running. Very often these lengthy series become too stagnant and similar to itself, leading me to feeling the need to take breaks from the show simply becauseI need to experience something in any way different for once. Last but not least, the ending is very rarely satisfying, leaving me wishing I had spent my time on a series that could end itself without so many bumps in the road.\\n\\n\r\nCross Game has none of those problems, and that is why it is a series that will be remembered.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, as most will immediately assume based on what they may see about the show before viewing it, Cross Game appears to be a baseball anime. However, that presumption is a mistake \u2013 is a show that involves baseball, but it isn\u2019t about baseball. Baseball is the lowest common denominator that ties almost every character to each other, and it is the driving force that provides the challenges and rivals that keeps the characters aiming higher. This drive and determination is a theme that is played out in a very classic shonen way, but Cross Game plays its cards just right by keeping the work, successes, and failures relatable to anyone. This is achieved by keeping the focus not on the baseball itself but on the characters and how they react to and deal with the significant baseball-related events as they occur, allowing the story to stay easily understandable and interesting to even non-sports fans.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say that there is no baseball in the series, quite the opposite in fact. However, the games that are focused on are limited to the most important, intense ones that keep the viewer on their toes while being easy to follow for the non-sports fan. The baseball fans in the audience need not be turned away by the comparatively sparse amount of actual playing, though. Since the viewers who aren\u2019t into baseball won\u2019t need to be entertained by antics or extravagant special moves, Cross Game\u2019s take on the game of baseball is realistic and fun for purists who just want a good game of baseball. Both sets of viewers will easily be able to understand how the game keeps the world of Cross Game turning.\\n\\n\r\nCross Game also knows where to put its attention when it comes to the characters. The cast is kept decently small and focused, allowing for as much growth and screen time as possible for the most important characters. The people who will be mainstays are made clear early on, allowing for introductions to take as little time as possible to give way for optimal development. Of the main cast, there are no flat characters, and with the diversity of the roster it is a rare moment to become tired of what the series has to offer. On top of their contributions to the story, each character also provides a unique atmosphere and sense of humor to the scenes they are involved in, keeping the show fresh and on its toes at all times. The cast deals with basic themes of life, death, and love, but each in their own different stride, bringing an interesting dynamic of how long it takes individual characters to cope with certain situations while also interacting with each other on a daily basis. This all leads to a small, well-developed lineup of characters that are all memorable, and that cast itself is quite possibly the strongest asset Cross Game has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nAs the saying goes, the real beauty is in the journey, not the destination, and Cross Game recognizes and relishes in this fact. In terms of plot twists or surprise advancements in the relationships, there are very few if any. The turns and twists the story takes are, for the most part, what many would describe as unsurprising or clich\u00e9. In the case of Cross Game, though, this is definitely not a negative. From the results of games to the status of relationships, Cross Game takes the most natural progression without attempting to insert unnecessary drama or convoluted twists, and it works perfectly without either of those because the story simply doesn\u2019t need them to stay both entertaining and lovely.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, animation, and even art are all simple and to the point. The retro-feel of the art with the more modern animation style gives a sort of \u201cremastered\u201d feeling to the viewer, complimenting the traditional standards and themes Cross Game makes a point to keep intact. The opening never changes and, while never exactly fitting the state the story is in at any given point in time, is just ambiguous enough to keep a certain relaxed mood in mind for each episode. The endings are never terrible but simply not memorable. The single exception is the first ending, which incorporates itself into the first episode in a beautiful and melancholy way that successfully set the tone for the entire next forty-nine episodes to come. If nothing else, that moment is one that will stick around in many viewers\u2019 memories as possibly the most emotionally powerful scene of the entire series, and that in itself is worth something significant.\\n\\n\r\nCross Game is not the most intellectually compelling anime you will ever watch. It doesn\u2019t delve deeply into subjects, and it never leaves a certain comfort zone when discussing more tender subjects. It doesn\u2019t have groundbreaking characters or a surprising story with exciting cliffhangers. It is fully aware, however, that those things don\u2019t matter if the execution isn\u2019t just right, and that shows bright as day. Thus, Cross Game\u2019s simplicity is also its beauty, standing as an instant classic and a coming-of-age story that will be looked upon as one of the greats someday by the power of its small successes and incredibly human characters.",

            "content": "My first impression of this show was \"another sport-themed anime? \u00ac\u00ac\". yeah i was expecting something like prince of tennis or captain tsubasa with baseball (you know, naturally impossible balls and over reacting of the game). it comes out that i was wrong.\r\nThis anime more than centering on just baseball, gives a great enphasis in friendship, values and, of course, romance. The techniques are not unnatural, there are no super curve balls or balls that gets in flames and destroy the other one's bat. instead this is a relaxing and ejoyable anime with a slow pace.\r\nThis means that its great if you are not searchingfor epicness or heart breaking anime but a quite \"awwww\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe story is simple but it develops very well. It manages to get some twits that you would never expect and overall there are no real fillers so its pretty much 50 episodes of story. (it sounds to much for an anime but believe me, you will want more)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nOne of the aspects that make me consider not watching it. Sometimes i feel the drawings are a little bit deformed and the animation is a little bit old. however the it is pertty fluid and that helps a lot for the baseball match to look great. its just matter to getting use to it.\\n\\n\r\nsound: 8/10\\n\r\nNot epic but good. didn't like the ending, the op was just fine but there were two songs that were pretty good. nothing more to say.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is why i loved the series, the characters are just so well developed you actually get very identified with them. You can understand them without having to explain it verbaly. there is a great variety of characters and each of them is instresting in their own way (exept for senda, over-anoyed me sometimes). i would say this is the strongest point in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\ni got pretty stuck with the series, again i really enjoyed it so pretty selfexplanatory rating. this series manages to give you exitement, laughts and tears in a very light way. good to rest from those shocking animes :)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, don't watch this series if you are searching for shocking OMG AWSOME ADICTING UBER EPIC anime that will leave you traumatized for a week. \\n\\n\r\nhope this review has help you!",

            "content": "When we group up, everything that defines us as a person is brought into question. This could be our ideals, passions, hobbies, relationships with others and many aspects that make us, well, us. This is part of the reason why as we grow up, we end up remembering our childhood or high school lives in such a bittersweet fashion. It is this period of our life that defines us so much as people, where we look at things that defined us in the past, and where we decide whether to keep them or discard them.\r\nOf course, this is not a difficult subject to write aboutor even make the audience relate to. Writing a story involving such a theme isn't difficult, since there really isn't much to do. The problem is, however, that writing characters centered around this theme is difficult. Since they are not defined by the setting, there's only so far you can go with writing characters around whatever the setting is. The key is, the characters have to feel and act human, not necessarily be complex (hell, in this kind of story, simplicity is probably the way to go). Problem is, a lot of writers sink into the melodrama and overblown character trait trap, where they focus on one layer and make that define the character or be overly dramatic even when there is nothing to be dramatic about.\\n\\n\r\nCross Game doesn't do that. Cross Game is human. In fact, it's so human that I legitimately wondered at times whether I was watching fictional characters or actual human beings. Hell, I wondered whether or not the writer was writing his own life experience onto the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't particularly remarkable, but serves its job well. The sports element is hardly even present for most of the show, and the show succeeds where most sports anime fail; making us care about the people playing the sports rather than watching it just for the sports. This works exceptionally well, hell I'd argue the show is more slice-of-life and about people discussing sports or practicing than actually playing matches. This works exceptionally well, since the viewer is emotionally involved in what's happening and isn't watching, oh I don't know, a football getting kicked around, players celebrating and that being the end of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis wouldn't have worked without the characters. The characters are the driving force behind the show, and they never stop moving forward from the beginning to the end. I've spoken earlier on that they are human, and I cannot help but repeat myself; they are human.\\n\r\nThey don't take loss by crying and running screaming or trying to kill themselves or any other stupid reaction. They don't go crazy and act like it's the end of the world if they lose a baseball game. No, they feel depressed for a bit, then life goes on. The character interactions are excellent and the romance which is the driving force behind the show is developed with a ridiculous amount of subtlety and care, and never feels forced or unnatural.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is pleasant to look at and very distinct, though the animation quality is nothing particularly special to look at. The backgrounds are very simply done, but somehow feel very normal looking and does a good job in bringing the show to life. The animation is the weakest aspect of the show, not because it's bad, but because the show deserves better.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors never scream or act irrationally, and a lot of care went into all of their lines. The soundtrack is nothing remarkable, but fits the overall mood of the show and plays at the right time, meaning that it's never in the way of the viewer enjoying the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Cross Game is an excellent show that does an exceptional job in its human characters, extremely human characterization and it's hard not to walk out of this show smiling and feeling satisfied. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",

            "content": "I know its a dramatic score. But to me I've always loved the anime and drawing styles of touch and orange road.\r\nAt first I was skeptical, like with most baseball and sport animes. but cross game was different from the very start. after all how often do you see the girl you love die in the fist epiosde?\r\nThat first episode caught my attention fully. that beautiful scene of Kou realising how he should be feeling. the music everything drew me in instantly. It truly stirred up my emotions and it really made me feel like Kou in a way.\r\nUnfortunately I wasn't patient enough and decidedto read the manga up to nearly the final 4 episodes. So I never knew the ending till today\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say this anime, is not hard core baseball. it revolves the story around baseball and its characters. The speical moments the funny twists, and the personalitys of the characters. even the jokes are well placed.\\n\\n\r\nTe final match really had me feeling like I was on the mound, I felt exactly Like IKou did in the anime, my heart beating quickly, puming adrenaline throughout my body, my breathing slightly paced from pressure and my body being worn out by it.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself cheering him on, foundmy self Lost in the world infront of me.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched major, and though it is good. Cross game really has it all. Its a baseball anime and manga on a completely different level. that really gets to you with story action and muisc.\\n\\n\r\nI really want everyone to watch this, but I guess you first have to be slightly into baseball to enjoy it. ^_^. But yeah I loved it. Completely.\\n\\n\r\nThe way it draws me in is amazing. I really hope there would be a second season. but I know thre won't and deep inside I hope there won't because this is a work of art. The suspense really really gets to you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 ito me is the score it completely deserves. Which is hard to get. (esepcially since anime seems to have gone done a BIG Boob Road. :P)",

            "content": "\"A four leaf clover\"\r\nThe Story...\r\nThe story starts off with a dramatic scenes and continuously moving towards the main story. An introduction of a boy named Kitamura Kou. Along the way he will encounter some trials and changes in life, facing it and surpassing these kinds of problems he\u2019s encountering will be hard at start, but looking at the bright side might help him to keep moving. Finally, being a part of a baseball team is quite a change for him, but knowing that he got a talent from it, he strive to do better for his own will. After that, there is a girl whois quite close to him or kind of an acquaintance of his named Tsukishima Aoba. At start it is quite funny, but when she is close to Kou it\u2019s going to be quite an annoyance on her side.  A story between baseball team and these two will fill up some nice entertainment and brings a kind of twist to the story as it moves along.\\n\\n\r\nThe main attraction here would be having a soft, light, and balance flow of events about the drama, comedy, romance, and most probably about baseball. It focuses on how to accomplish the trials and encounters the story gets. Fulfilling a dream as an individual, a team, or for other sake will be added as it became an interesting plot. Since it involves sports, giving such determination and willingness to perform well in a game may be attractive as they put such tension and thrill into it. The development of the story is good since it has 50 episodes to watch. They focus on the flow of the main and other characters in the story while giving also a great impact to the main arc itself. It is a kind of development that is done slowly, little by little, arc by arc. Also putting a comedy and drama scene to the story gives something else for the viewers to be entertained of, for which to avoid boredom.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation...\\n\\n\r\nThe art & animation is great. The backgrounds, the sceneries, and other minor details on the story are surely detailed and have a radiant effect that appears on every episode of the series. As for the OP and ED theme, it definitely matches on the whole story itself. The characters are drawn in such a way that probably most children can appreciate, while it is animated based on its specific situation. All are well drawn and animated based on each scene which brings such nice feeling to the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nSound...\\n\\n\r\nA cheerful, lively, calm, and something deep BG music and sounds will be heard. It is a kind of sounds that surely bring pleasing effects throughout the story. Also both OP and ED songs here are something nice to hear as it gives soothing and attractive melody that is nicely suitable for the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters in this series give a lot of entertainment and add some interesting plot to the story. These three main which are Aoba, Kou, and Yuuhei, they may have some similarity on their traits, but deep inside of them they have some unique traits to tell. And for the supporting and other characters that appears throughout the show, they made it complete as they give meaning, laughter and drama to the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIt has a promising story to tell. A kind of anime that keeps you interested on the flow of the story. A story that gives something to laugh about and at the same time gives some drama to reminisce over. Adding such ideal art & animation to the story makes it truly fascinating; sounds that matches the theme and the traits of the characters that are nice to hear; and characters that supports the story makes it even worthy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOn its concept and development of the story, it is nice to have as it has a well balanced atmosphere between sports, romance, and comedy. It is a series that includes such wonderful art that affects the overall image of the story, an animation that matches the traits and delivery of each character, and sounds that helps to add some feelings to the show. It\u2019s quite a nice mix of these as they make a wonderful story to tell.",

Even still, I find it hard to not write a bit about this anime Cross Game, even after two weeks of watching it.\r\nFrom what you can read from the synopsis, the story is about a boy, Kou, who had a childhood love with a girl Wakaba, one of four sisters who run a small family batting center/cafe in with their father.\r\nIt actually starts after the first episode (you'll see what I mean.....), and what you will experience is something you probably never have before.In general the anime may appear to be a simple slice of life story in a baseball setting on the surface with a predictable theme or overlying plot, but Cross Game will send all your expectations you may have from what you assume from the first episodes out of the BALL PARK. You WILL be proven wrong. You'll witness some of the most believable characters you'll EVER see in an anime.... I can guarantee you that. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it a home run (no pun intended), are mainly the interpersonal relationships between all the characters, the beautiful art from the classic manga writer Adachi, and the amazing OST. \\n\\n\r\nThis series needs so much more attention because it doesn't have all the cliche anime tropes or the sleek, modern anime art style we're all so used to now. But even then, if it's in your plan to watch, PLEASE WATCH IT NOW.  I don't hand out 10's very easily, let alone write reviews, but this series deserves it. You WILL have a great anime completed after finishing this masterpiece.",

            "content": "Ahhh Cross Game, in my opinion a very unique hidden gem in the pile of generic anime that has been coming out. This is one of the more authentic, pure and relaxing animes I have ever watched and definitely one that score on my top 10. The realism and charm of the characters is simply captivating.\r\nTo begin my review i would like to say that i don't play baseball and i barely know the rules. I usually never watched sports anime and for those shows that i watched none of them score among my favorite but this one. Cross Game is much more than asport anime and do not rely on unreal and exaggerated effects like say, prince of tennis.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great, the art is simple yet effective where it needs to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very straight forward and simple. As i said this is a relaxing anime although the games do manage to get you to the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nWhat it's truly outstanding in my opinion are the characters. 90% of the anime out there now are played by characters that are just unreal. Cross game, however, manages to deliver great characters that you can identify yourself. Aoba in my opinion is the of the more authentic tsunderes you will find and kou is not a blind guy like most animes do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall give this anime a chance unless you strictly want action and blood. Cross game is just an anime that will make you smile, root for their team and cry. Right of the bat i kicks of with a strong plot and there will be cliffhangers through the series that will make the 50 episodes pass with a breeze. it does gets a little bit slow towards the middle but i think 50 episodes is a great number and there is hardly any filler.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i enjoy this series a lot the humor is great and it one of those animes that leave you with a bittersweet feeling since it leaves you wanting for more but you know that the ending was perfect was it was.",

            "content": "[A spoiler-free Review]\r\nI was recommended this anime a lot of times and I had read a lot of reviews of it before watching the anime which led me to expect a lot from it. And fortunately, it certainly did meet my expectation if not, exceeded it. \r\nAdapted from a manga series by Adachi Michiru, Cross game is a romantic comedy sports (baseball) anime series made by SynergySP studio which has also produced some hits like \u201cHayate no Gotoku!\u201d. Although superficially, it looks like just another sports anime, its main forte lies in how characters develop their relationships rather than the baseball itself. And the interactionsof characters are portrayed so finely that you can pleasingly watch it the whole day without being bored in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nTalk about the plot. Cross game has a very simple and usual plot like any other baseball series: some high-schoolers dream of reaching koushien, where a national high-school baseball tournament is held. Well, I have no complaints here, though. After all, it does set up a good setting for the characters to develop and blend very well among themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime starts off showing the protagonist, Kitamoura Kou, in middle school. Probably due to proximity, his family has very good relations with Tsukishima family thus making their children also very close to each other. Unexpectedly, one day, Adachi\u2019s trademark \u2018tragedy\u2019 storms into their peaceful lives, which then opens up a way to an actual story which follows after 4 years of the previously shown time \u2013 meaning Kou is a high-schooler now! It is a pretty powerful start albeit probably not original, which draws the viewers into the story from the get-go.\\n\\n\r\nThe main allure of this series is the characterization.  Every single character is given a fair enough of screen time to depict his/her traits and the viewers can\u2019t help getting attached to the characters. The pace of the story is slow but it\u2019s actually because of that, the characters are able to grow on the viewers and become so memorable. However, this might be a miss rather than a hit to those who are more into fast paced action-packed series. But again, it cannot be helped; a single series cannot cater to every type of viewers as some things can be polar opposite of each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe subtle depiction of the relationship between two main leads is always intriguing to watch. They never speak out their minds even until the very end of the anime. However, the expressions and emotions of them feel so natural and real that viewers can easily discern what they are thinking. It is very often said in the series itself by other characters that the two main leads are very much alike. And it is undoubtedly true in a sense that they both are very reluctant to show their true feelings and outwardly, keep a hate relations whilst still caring for each other in most situations. Also, some daily manners of them like drinking an out-of-date milk apathetically coincide. This makes their relations very intriguing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the series \u2013 romance is very nimbly hinted in the series. As I already said, two main leads don\u2019t openly admit their standings as a romantic couple. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t any development at all. Gradually but surely, the reticent behavior of their feelings for each other seems to be opened as time goes although the anime ends before the very end of its conclusion. And it is completely fine as the romance in this show isn\u2019t supposed to be taken to the extreme in the first place. It is just one of aspects, that embellishes the anime. So, viewers are not to expect a full-fledged romance from this series.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the two main leads, side characters also get to enjoy a pretty good amount of romance. Some love triangle also gets evolved; however, it is never taken to the extreme level keeping the series fairly simple and relaxing. From an unrequited love to a successful one, the anime presents both of them in quite an elegant manner. The best thing is: the drama in this series is never overly exaggerated yet evokes the powerful emotional feelings in the viewers. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy part is just as great kept to a reasonably minimum level which perfectly suits the ambience. This may not get the viewers to laugh out loudly (as it is never intended to) but definitely ensures the viewer to form a smile throughout the comedy scene. It actually serves as a medium to keep the viewer busy from being too depressed from the emotional drama keeping the anime as relaxing and light-hearted as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the baseball part may not be the main focus of the series, it isn\u2019t of low quality at all. Prior to watching this series, I, myself wasn\u2019t much familiar with baseball but was still able to grasp what was going on to get on the edge of the baseball\u2019s thriller. So, for those who are reluctant to watch this series because of baseball (sports), don\u2019t put this series aside without even trying just because you don\u2019t know baseball game.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and artwork is slightly above mediocre level. Some characters look almost same; it is sometimes hard to distinguish the character by the looks alone. However, although it is far from being able to give a stunning and awesome sense of aesthetics to the viewer, it is pretty much watchable and fairly consistent. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, the opening song, \u201cSummer Rain\u201d is somewhat catchy to at least make you not want to skip it. And while the first ending song didn\u2019t really catch my interest at all, the second and third ending song were more or less decent. The BGM (Background Music) especially, during the baseball game, is placed very rightly adding another level of exciting feeling while watching the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe only possible downside in the character is of Mizuki Asami. He doesn\u2019t have much role or any character development in the series. He is introduced as a love rival only to be ignored by the female lead. Or maybe, it\u2019s just me being not able to understand the author\u2019s intention of keeping this character in the cast. So, whether this is the downside or not is I cannot say with certainty. Nevertheless, even if it is one, it is not so significant to be an obstacle.\\n\\n\r\nSpanning 50 episodes, Cross game is a well thought-out series with very few flaws that are also overlookable. I enjoyed this anime so much that fifty episodes didn\u2019t feel long at all. Characters are so memorable and attachable that even weeks after watching it, whenever I think of Cross Game, I feel a sort-of warm nostalgic feeling.\\n\\n\r\nSimple yet, a very powerful emotion-invoking series full of likeable characters. It gets a whopping 10/10 from me.\\n\r\nRecommended for almost anyone to at least try this series. If you are looking for a relaxing light-hearted slice-of-life anime, then it is a plus.\\n\r\nAnd for those who are avoiding it because of the sports genre, don\u2019t do so. This series is more of a slice-of-life anime than the sports. After all, the sport is used just as a backbone to lay out the way for the plot to proceed.\\n",

            "content": "I'll try my best not to spoil the story. This is my first review at MAL after my long anime hiatus. \r\nAnyway, the reason why I watched this anime was because of Ookiku Furikabute, another baseball anime. Cross Game is on top of its recommendation list that is why I got curious and started to watch it. Ookiku was so great and very recommendable. It's a great example of a sports anime that is why I expected a lot from Cross Game, hoping this new one is as superb as the former. But now that I'm close to finishing it, I can say that it'stotally a different anime than I expected. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're a hardcore sports anime fan or the kind who looks forward to seeing thrilling and exciting sports action, you might not enjoy this one. Cross Game, as for me, is 30% baseball, 70% human drama. The story includes a \"past character\" whose presence is all over the show, which appeared to me like the effect of Sasuke to Naruto (character and show itself). It is heavy in human drama which I think most fan girls will love. When I say human drama, that's romance for you. Well, I kind of liked it too but for a sports anime to be overshadowed by another element called romance is a bit off. Maybe because this is something new for me as I'm always used to seeing the sports and action to be the main ingredients of the show. I also feel that the two elements are kind of frustrating to watch because it's not clear to me the focus of the story. You will be presented with episodes of baseball actions then after that, a series of slice of life dramas. I mean, if you want to reach Koshien and be the best in Japan, practice, practice and practice 'till you vomit blood and not let your idle time be spent in endless bickering. Well, maybe the bickering and LQs are there because it's more human drama than sports after all. Because of that I felt that the baseball element is not so important to the show, the \"who's-gonna-end-up-with\" part appeared to be more essential.\\n\\n\r\nAs per the characters, the hero is not your underdog type of character ( Ippo, Sena, Mihashi) nor the arrogant one (Sakuragi, Ryoma and Toua). Hmmm..a very average yet the type who only comes once in a decade kind of pitcher, he is. So if you're also the type who wants to see an awesome and cool main character, don't try this one. Yes, I think he's great but not that \"great\" (in the fanboy kind of way). I think he doesn't have that 100% sports resolve that you normally hear from other sports heroes. I mean, he doesn't wish to be a great baseball player, his goal is not that clear. For another character there's Aoba, the next main lead, a cute girl who mentored the hero. She is part of the love train. Anyways, I like her free spirited character but I'm annoyed by the responses she gets from the male characters of the show. Hmmm.. is she really that pretty/cute? The baseball team is crazy for her. As for the rest of the cast, hmmm...they are likable in the fangirl kind of way. If you're up for the thrills, there's no SUUPEER sports player you can totally cheer for (well, as for me anyway).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Cross Game is a decent anime. I think it's still better than the popular titles these days. It's not boring but will not excite you either. Well, there are cute moments that can make you smile and the question of \"who's-gonna-end-up-with\" is enough for you to continue watching the series. But still, A TRUE SPORTS ANIME FAN (or even a shounen-action fan, can that include me?) will not fully enjoy this. Nevertheless, it doesn't hurt to try this one. \\n\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE:\\n\r\nAfter watching the LAST EPISODE, I can say that this is truly a FANGIRL SERIES. It is barely a sports anime. I enjoyed the last part, because it\u2019s really cute. But then again, the \u201cbaseball\u201d is really the side dish. Don\u2019t hope for it to be the next ____ (write your fave sports anime here), or else you\u2019ll be disappointed. Watch Cross Game as a human drama anime and not as a sports anime.\\n",

            "content": "I have to say, the art and sound is fairly good in the show.  It brings out a natural and lively yet peaceful environment in the anime.  However, I have to say the enjoyment was a total failure for me.  I fell asleep on nearly watching all the episodes and realized that even if I watched 1000 episodes, this story would never reach or even hint on the climax.  The characters are alright, but they are boring in their own way.  The female protagonist is your normal average good looking tomboy girl, and the male protagonist is a little strangeby being clueless but being reliable at times, however its not so extreme as to be \"interesting\".  Both are fairly normal characters.  The story was pretty average too.  There is no thrill, but only a boring attitude that stays much too calm in the entirety of the show.",

            "content": "\"Simple is best\" isn't always an accurate statement. So instead of doing the usual score / followed by explanation, I'll give you a rundown of why I liked and disliked this show.\r\nI know I'll probably get some hate for saying this, but this show isn't as perfect as 95% (or so, or more) of the reviews would have you believe. That doesn't mean it's bad though, it's actually a very solid show.\r\nWhat's wrong with it then?\r\nIn MY opinion, some of the characters (or rather, how they were used), the sound and art aren't up to par with a \"perfect\" show. I also think the Studiomade more episodes than were needed as \"fillers\", which made them sort of rush the ending to complete the story.\\n\\n\r\nI believe a character like Azuma could have received more time on screen during the first half of the show, with more time allocated to him, rather than simply tagging along with Kou or the rest of the squad. He's a nice and important character which wasn't explored as much as he could have been. After his ''bad guy'' act when he's first presented, he seems to turn into a Kou magnet - he goes where Kou goes and often scolds him or \"tags along\" with him, but that's that. He does receive some love later on though...\\n\\n\r\nThen you have Senda - though I suppose he is simply doing what he's supposed to do - being an annoying arse. If that was the intention, then they surely hit the spot.\\n\\n\r\nThere's one \"character\" which I do despise though and I'm not sure if any other reviewer covered this. The cat. That cat honestly almost made me drop the show - He serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever and he's not even ''cute'' or anything of that sort, he's just a disturbance.\\n\\n\r\nThis cat will show up at random times, FOR NO REASON, and simply ''meow'' it out. Ok, had it been once or twice, or thrice, I wouldn't have minded it. But more than THIRTY times? Yes, I did count it and I'm not talking about him being present in different situations either, I'm talking about this freak showing up to *MEOW* with the exact same face and annoying sound, THE EXACT SAME - they didn't even bother recording a different sound for most of the time he's on screen. That alone brought the quality of the show down quite a lot - also, it's not only during the episodes either, during the 2nd half of the show they add an Intro Quiz and the Answer to that Quiz after the ED, in which he's ALWAYS present doing that stupid annoying *MEOW*. Good Lord is that annoying, and now DOUBLY so since you'll be seeing that shit in the INTRO, episode and after-ED. Good luck with that - talk about Anger Management....\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress - since I mentioned that intro right above, I'll talk about the OP and the ED. As Yuuhei, Azuma would say ''Who are they?'' - I think there were 2 different OPs and 3 or 4 different EDs. I say I think because all of them were so ''so-so'' that I really can't remember them even right after watching an episode - in fact, the one thing I can remember from two of the endings is that they were really \"forced\", the vocals annoyed me a lot. I believe that I started to skip the OP and ED right at the 3rd episode, and simply stopped to check them when there was a new one. Oh, add a DOUBLE SKIP to that because there's the annoying Quiz with the cat and another annoying song sung by MOMIJI before the Quiz. Maybe it's the case that I'm just not the target audience.... yeah, maybe, but maybe not, I don't think I'd have liked this even in my early teen years. Actually, I'm sure I wouldn't have.\\n\\n\r\nEnough of that now, let's talk a bit about the art. What's the problem here? Not much, really. It's just that, it's just cookie cutter \"modern\" anime art, there's nothing outstanding about it, absolutely nothing. At the beginning some of the characters looked a lot like each other and I had some trouble identifying which one was which, but that quickly stopped being the case once the characters grew up. The backgrounds are not as great as I hoped them to be, even during the action scenes, which sort of let me down. There's one thing that sort of irked me though, there are times when the art looks \"flat\" - you'll get this if you pay attention to game scenes - look at the stadium, it seems like the audience and the characters look like \"bent flat papers\" - it's hard to explain but you'll see what I mean if you just look closely during the game scenes. I've also noticed this lack of \"depth\" at other times. Having seeing great art in other Anime, even anime from as far back as 1994, I was disappointed by this.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that does deserve a lot of praise is how Cross Game manages to captivate you despite all of its flaws, it has a gripping power hard to find  - you want to know if X will confess to Y, or if they actually hate each other, and how Z will develop throughout the show. There was a \"twist\" mid-season which was mildly entertaining - I won't spoil it though. I also like how Cross Game deals with the loss of a loved one and relationships within the family and friends, growing up etc. Teenagers will get the most out of it, but even adults will probably take the time to remember their own hardships and moments of sadness/happiness when watching it.\\n\\n\r\nHave you noticed that I still have not mentioned Baseball? That's because Cross Game is able to present something other than \"just\" Baseball, which I appreciate. This doesn't mean that Baseball is left aside, so if you're a ban of Baseball, you'll not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nIf, like me, you had no knowledge of Baseball beforehand, you don't have to worry - even though they could've explained a little bit more in detail how things like conceding a walk / safety bunts work, you'll get the gist of it soon enough just by watching the show. Actually, I do have to say what an amazing job they did here, because not only did I not know anything about Baseball, I had this idea that it was a very boring sport and that worried me before watching Cross Game, but I was fairly surprised to discover what Baseball is like - I actually may end up watching real Baseball now, because I quite enjoyed what I saw from the games in Cross Game. I think this concludes what I set out to achieve here - explain why the show is worth a go if you were unsure about watching it, while at the same time keeping in mind that it is definitely not perfect and you will notice its flaws if you're paying attention.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed reading this review as much as I enjoyed writing it, I'm always trying to improve and will gladly read any criticism you may have towards the things I wrote - send me a PM if you feel like it!",

Throughout their story, the characters progress through their love of baseball and discover much about themselves and each other. \r\nI don't really want to give away much more about this anime than that, because to do so would be a crime. I would be robbing you of the experience of life and love and baseball. \r\nHowever, what I can sayis don't be fooled by the retro art style. From the author of the critically acclaimed Touch (a Japanese classic from the 80's which I have yet to see or read) Cross game is a diamond in the rough. There is a little something for everybody in this series. For those who love sports, you have baseball, but that is only the surface. There is also an touching love story, but again that is just scratching the surface.\\n\\n\r\nCross Game is not just a simplistic retro baseball anime. Players from any sport are taught to master the basics. Cross Game doesn't make the use of flashy plays to win the hearts of its viewers. Cross game use the fundamentals such as good characters and good story to challenge its rivals.   It is a story of life and love, seen through baseball.  The characters work with each other perfectly just like professional fielders, and the story knocks it out of the park.\\n\\n\r\nJust like the underdog Team Seishu, Cross Game is not to be overlooked.",

After a time skip of 4 years the show begins in earnestfollowing Ko as he enters high school and his attempt to guide his team to reach the finals of the baseball tournament. \\n\\n\r\nCross Game is based off the shonen sports manga by Mitsuru Adachi, and in many ways Cross Game follows the standard shonen sports manga formula.  A talented individual joins an underachieving team and as the team \u2018level\u2019s up\u2019 through it\u2019s many challenges including attempts to disestablish the team they finally reach their goal.  It contains copious amounts of baseball .. and in one case one crucial game spans 3 episodes! Normally I\u2019d run a mile from such a show.  While I don\u2019t mind baseball I\u2019m certainly not a fan and  my preference for anime is generally not shonen. Yet I\u2019m going to recommend Cross Game and even more, I consider it a masterpiece. Why you ask?  The answer is simple .. the characters that inhabit and develop within the baseball world created by Mitsuru Adachi, along with the awesome comedy.  \\n\\n\r\nVisually Cross Game looks childish in its animation style with very \u2018retro\u2019 character designs based off Mitsuru Adachi distinctive manga style.  You would almost be forgiven in thinking that this was an american cartoon instead of an anime with it\u2019s muted colours. That doesn\u2019t mean that the show skimps on it\u2019s animation.  Just don\u2019t expect it to look like Angel Beats. Soundtrack wise there are a couple of awesome insert songs but apart from that the soundtrack is pretty sparse and just lets you enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I think that you\u2019ll be able to tell after the first two episodes whether you\u2019d like Cross Game.  Personally it\u2019s .. well it\u2019s probably the only sports anime I\u2019ve bothered to complete and it\u2019s one of my favorite shows.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the Manga has been licenced and been published in english, currently the anime is sitting with Vis Media (who licensed the manga) and has yet to see a DVD release.",

            "content": "Story (10/10):\r\nAs many of his works suggest, adachi mitsuru always have a strong story-telling ability. Despite being 50 episodes long, I still have a feeling of \"want more\" towards this anime. In subjective comparison, I watch most anime with less episodes and feel that was already enough, and few of them is even too much.\r\nThe story development is done really well here. At times, I was confused to tell it was centered around a team's struggle to go to the koshien, or complications of aoba-kou relationship. It was good work to make it synergize nicely, tough. Supported with excellent drawings and right timing, simple scenecan be emotional in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I like how akane takigawa character introduced to the story.\\n\r\nThe timing was perfect to improve the story to the whole new level of excitement. And I actually amazed on how much this anime feels real. I didn't find any impossible trick ball on the game, or over-dramatized match development. But still generates so much fun. I actually surprised on some in-game tactics displayed. Adachi mitsuru really knows his game.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\r\nConsidering me not having watched too much anime to compare, and too much skill to judge this part. I can only say that I'm happy that this anime didn't lose it's \"adachi mitsuru\" feel. Compared to adachi mitsuru's other work that made to anime, I like Cross Game anime art the most. (But I know really well that the age and technology used might be different too, so I can't really complain)\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\r\nregarding sound, I could only comment about scoring.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first episode, the scoring is already done really well. I like how koikogarete mita yume played in the end of episode. It adds much emotion to an already emotional scene.\\n\\n\r\nOther score is not so bad either. They did what a score should do: \"emotion building\". And I can tell that it is not an easy job. One need right timing and right score, if something slipped even a little bit, that job won't be really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10):\\n\r\nThe character made by adachi mitsuru is one thing that made me like his work. I personally don't care that some of his character look alike, the important thing is character personalization. And the seiyuu of each and every character is deserved a well praise for this reason.\\n\\n\r\nI like how the characters can make a funny joke despite how their personalities are. The only thing I can complain is the pairing (:P). Then again, it is my personal preference of the story, not everyone would feel troubled by this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nYes, I enjoy this very much!\\n\r\nalthough I must admit that 10/10 comes after I re-watch this anime the second time. The first time I experienced the ending, I think something is lacking in there. I would really like to see some koshien match or a bit more extends to the story. But, after re-watch it I don't think it was really necessary after all. Because all the question I have is actually answered.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I still find troubling is the pairing. I asure you, adachi mitsuru need to done something better with the pairing there (:P).",

            "content": "If you watch this series, be prepared to embark on a roller coaster of emotion and enjoy some incredibly tense baseball. You will cry, jump in excitement, and sigh in relief.\r\nThe story really isn't that complicated and for the most part isn't even that interesting. You get hit with some incredible emotion in the first couple of episodes as the main character's 5th grade girlfriend tragically dies. I really felt the devastation that both Kou (the main character) and the Tsukishima family went through after Wakaba's death. The baseball portion of the story is well thought out with a variety of win/loss scenarios which alwayskept me guessing as to whether or not they would win the game (until the end of course :) ). My main beef with the story is the constant referencing and flashbacks to memories about wakaba and her death. I know she left a giant hole when she died, but my heart can hardly hold up when you keep reminding me of the enormous emotional pressure each of these kids carries around. I found the comedy and banter between characters very refreshing from other series. I'm not sure what it was, but it seems like each conversation carried an interesting tone, joke,  or double-meaning.\\n\\n\r\nI love the art style. It makes everything look very human. I think the beauty is in the inaccuracy of some of the lines and colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound was alright. There were times when I got tired of hearing the exact same suspense music as a close miss occurs.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters (Kou and Aoba) had a lot of depth, but almost all of it was inferred. Several times in the series side-characters say that Kou and Aoba are not \"honest about their feelings\" which basically means they are a brick wall of emotion-deflection to other people. This can get kind of frustrating watching them fail to make a change in their relationships, but people actually act like this.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is enjoyable from a comedy aspect, but most of its worth comes from understanding how much losing a close friend/sibling can impact two people. The pacing of the baseballs was also done well. I never thought a game went on too long or focused on the wrong things.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending left me feeling a little empty. I wanted to watch them succeed at Koshien, and see Aoba and Kou grow closer.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a good watch.\\n",

I've rated it 10 for everything except Art, which I gave an 8. (Which is to be expected of an anime made in 2009). This anime gives you laughs, feels and excitement in every episode.

Him caring for his long deceased friend and keeping her memories and dreams with him and working towards them is testimony to his warm nature. This guy makes you love the anime and makes you partof his dream. His friendships with Akaishi and Azuma are other highlights in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has strong characters with great bonding and a genuine cause to pursue.

'Summer rain' is the best opening credits song in an anime I've ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nGuys who like a sports themed anime with great friendships, don't miss this one.

Son of Sports Store, and his best friend \"First Love\" Tsukishima Wakaba, One of 4 Daughters of Batting Centre, Due to their businesses they all become close, pretty much like an Extended Family. \r\nWakaba's 2nd youngest Aoba is more a \"Tom Boy\" loves Baseball, Aoba is jealous of Kou taking her sister away, They fight a lot, But mainly due to them being so similar, Kou respects and looks up to Aoba, She is the reason he starts playing Baseball andto live a dream of going to the K\u014dshien which is basically a super famous tournament for the best high school team in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nCannot tell you much more without Spoiling the series, From early on *Notice the OP Title Splash* You will understand what i mean after some Episodes have passed.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: \\n\\n\r\nSound in the series is good, Catchy OP/ED Songs and the voice work fitted all the characters. \\n\r\nArt for me is something people will love or dislike, This series being one that finished in 2010, is in places rather sloppy Animation wise, I have to admit the further the series developed the less sloppiness i saw, Also the styling is very \"Retro\" My first thoughts was this looked a early 90's Anime not one from 2010, But i have to admit i do enjoy the styling and it doesn't hurt the series, just isn't that special either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nFrom the early Episodes i was thinking should i continues, Issue is for me, I enjoyed Episode 1, Gave me so much detail and hooked me from the very first minutes, But after a few Episodes with the faults i have mentioned with the Style/Animations i was thinking of halting the series, But im sooooooooooooooooo glad i didn't, I stuck with it and reached the 50 Episodes i hardly no time what so ever, 50 Episodes is long this day in age, Most new Series rarely go over 11/12/13 Episodes, it sadden's me they don't because i do say, If i had the choice i prefer this amount of content, it gave its message and story across without feeling rushed or leaving many parts out, This is a longer series done right, And once i was finished i was satisfied with the ending, Wasn't the route i was routing for though, but worked.\\n\\n\r\nAs i put earlier, I wondered why many people said this was a 10/10 or a Masterpiece, But after watching the series, I totally understand why people give this a 10, Its very close to a Masterpiece, This being said, Its about Baseball, If you are like me and not a fan of the Sport, DO NOT Let that put you off the series because you will miss out on a gem of a series.\\n",

            "content": "Story: 9\r\nIt's pretty hard for an anime about trying to win a baseball tournament to get a 9 rating for story.  In addition to being about that, there are more realistic and subtle child, young adult and adult love stories.  There are even some love and unrequited love stories that carry over from childhood.\r\nThe story follows the main characters from children to young adults and there are well placed flashbacks that add extra meaning to the past and the present.  The scenes are very well structured and allow the viewer to understand more complex relationships by showing instead of telling.\r\nThe story basicallysets up the entire series in the timeline of the first episode.  We know what's going to happen but it actually makes everything more enhanced.  I frequently found myself wondering how and when and even if they were going to succeed.  Near the half-way point it didn't matter to me as I trusted the quality of the work and enjoyed binge watching. It very much reminded me of the \"pebble in the pond\" story.  It's amazing how the diverse cast all effect each-other.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is not flashy but it does deserve some credit.  I found it very interesting how the artists created a lookalike that allowed me identify each character separately.  As far as baseball animations:  they are average.  It's pretty obvious a decent amount of shortcuts were taken here.  However, there were a few plays (the one I'm thinking of is at the end) that seemed like shortcuts that really succeeded in having stylistic effect.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  There is one beginning song but I never got tired of it.  There are a few ending songs and they're all very powerful.  Voice-acting is top notch.  Ambient sound is a bit sparse.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  10\\n\r\nThere is so much depth to over a dozen main characters.  An enemy in the show might turn out to be one of the kindest.  Divas are not just Divas.  People who seem popular might not be and vice-versa.  The great thing about this is that none of it is out of left field (pun intended) and all of it is believable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9:\\n\\n\r\nThere were a few, more slice-of-life episodes in the first half that were just okay.  Sometimes the subtly may have been a bit too subtle.  Overall the show stands out as an excellent compromise of art and formula.  Oh, and by the end I was so into it I was yelling nonsensical things at the TV.  The show left me feeling lucky to have experienced it.  I did not find it too long or short and I felt like it tied it's loose ends well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis might not have seemed very high budget but it was an act of love and talent from the creators.  I'd happily recommend this to anyone who likes a good story and characterization.  Love of baseball is not necessary.  If you're not a fan, you might not start loving baseball after watching it, but you will love a show about baseball.\\n",

            "content": "Highschool baseball? Sure.\r\nAs the poster implies, it does have romance. Do not fret, it has a balance between the romance and sports genre. The only redundant point would be based on the happenings on the first episode, and it gets weird at times (because of how convenient it is for the plot). Be informed that the series in itself is quite melodramatic. I mean, the chance of those things happening in real life...is very low. Not that I have complaints against the series, I'm just saying my point of view. I did not get emotionally attached or hyped in most scenarios when the viewer issupposed to feel such emotions. It has good story-writing, but it gets quite dull in the middle of the series because of the slow-pacing and the never-changing plot and the minimal conflict (relatively speaking), which causes only a little bit of tension. You might be shocked, but the 50-episode build-up might not be the one you are looking forward to. I'd leave that to your imagination, what the focus and ending would actually be.\\n\\n\r\nThe following statements would refer to the characters, art and animation, and sound quality:\\n\r\nThe show reveals the setting from childhood years of our characters until their teenage years, so you'd expect character development. I say to you, aside from their physical skills and outward appearance, they remain the same pretty much throughout the whole show. The show itself limits the room for development. In a sense, it is appropriate. On the other hand, the designs of the cast all look different from one another, and it is evident that it was drawn during the 2009-2010 period. It gives off a familiar vibe though. On a different note, the sounds are similar to your regular ol' baseball anime shows. There is nothing that can be considered out-of-place, so I would say that it is a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has its ups and downs, so it may be fun and boring to watch at certain points in the series. It's something that could be used to pass off time, but it's not something that's so great that you'd bawl over how amazing it is as a show.\\n\r\n[TL;DR]\\n\r\nCross Game is a baseball story having the characters unable to move on from the past.\\n\r\nStory : 5 (40% = 2)\\n\r\nCharacter : 7 (25% = 1.75)\\n\r\nArt & Animation:6 (20% = 1.2)\\n\r\nSound : 5 (15%= 0.75)\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 5.7 ~> 6/10\\n\r\n(Enjoyment : 8, Not Included in Criteria Rating)",

            "content": "I really liked this anime, probably because I love sport, and I also enjoy romance. The thing I like least is characters acting inconsistent, and this story makes sure to justify all their characters actions, so I feel you could write it from a dozen different perspectives and you would still get a nice story and be able to empathise with that specific character, even fi you disagree with them.\r\nI think the art and sound were a bit lacking, some of the transitions weren't great as well, but that didn't really take away from the anime, at least in my opinion. It is funny andlight-hearted most of the time, but that makes the contrast when it is full of feeling all the more impactful. From me its a 10/10, along with a very strong recommendation.\\n\\n\r\nJust a word of warning, while I also enjoy Haikyuu, this is a completely different anime to your typical shounen sports anime. This has a fair bit of drama, and some romance as well, and goes over a multiple year period at a relatively fast pace. At the same time, it has that realism and relatability that shounen often lacks, but the action, while less frequent, in many ways benefits from it not becoming overly repetitive or predictable.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst review, I wanted to be careful not to give any spoilers, and lastly please enjoy!",

            "content": "I don't give two shits about baseball. I would never go out of my way to watch a game, and most of my knowledge comes from playing Wii Sports. But, this anime did something. It did something amazing. Something I thought would never happen in a million years. It made me give a shit about baseball.\r\nThe story of this anime stands out compared to other sports anime because it doesn't solely focus on the sport itself. Cross Game instead focuses more on character development and romance. Right from the first episode, it doesn't make a massive deal about baseball, but tries to show the friendshipbetween Kou and Wakaba whilst still getting across the fact that it is, without a doubt, about baseball.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime puts a lot of emphasis on romance. The romance is well-developed and never feels unrealistic or rushed, like other shows. This anime has love triangles around every corner, which makes fun to speculate who will get with who and who will get rejected. They do this to make the love hate relationship between Kitamura Kou and Tsukishima Aoba twice as interesting to watch, making you enjoy the relationship between the two till the very end.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is also exceedingly dramatic, being a drama and all. The creators knew what they were doing when making this anime and it shows. The clever use of tension and build up gets you excited to see just what might happen next and makes you click that next episode button faster than any pitch Kou ever threw. It gives off a real lasting impression that makes the show that much more memorable.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this isn't a shounen, I felt that the baseball matches in this anime are just as intense as any other show. Every hit, every pitch, every catch all feel real. As the anime progresses, characters start getting better and better at baseball and that's just what makes it so exciting. You've been with the characters and got to know them whilst watching. That makes it all the more satisfying when you see these characters improve and win matches. It's a sense of excitement I don't feel anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are simple yet effective. Kou is the ace pitcher of Seishu academy and is, hard working, great at lying, dependable, well-developed, likable main character that you're sure to like. Aoba is what you call a \"tsundere\" and is seemingly cold, warm to others that aren't Kou, a great pitcher, Kou's teacher, everyone's crush, similar to Kou and a great character.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is also really nice. Akaishi is Seishu's catcher and is a big, menacing guy who's actually a really nice, loving person. Azuma is a legendary batter who only remembers those who have some importance to him and is a quite, cool, collected, honest, harsh, smart, dependable character. Senda is... also there, I guess. Every character is unique, interesting, fun and a joy to watch every time.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is unique, to say the least. It's simplistic and reminiscent of older anime, giving it an old-school classic feel to it. The simplicity also serves well in the fact that the show itself is simplistic. The one flaw I do have about the art, is that almost all the characters have the same face and expression. It isn't too much of an issue, but it did bug me quite a bit more than it should have.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the anime fits the overall theme. It's simplistic and easy to listen to, just like how the anime is simplistic and easy to watch. The opening song \"Summer Rain\" perfectly sets up each episode of the anime. It gives off a somewhat tropical beat and makes the whole thing relaxing. I can't be bothered to talk about each every ED in detail, so here's a sentence for each one. ED 1 was a slow, tragic song that fits the themes it tried to get across in the first quarter. ED 2 is a nice sounding song that would be great if it weren't for the fact that it doesn't suite the anime that well, being a sort of rap song. ED 3 has a really nice, relaxing beat and slow rhythm, making it my favourite ED in this anime. ED 4 has a real nice sounding piano and lyrics that suite the show pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Cross Game is a fun, relaxing series with twist, turns and exciting moments around every corner. It made me laugh. It made me feel sad. It made me a better man. But most of all, it made me give two shits about baseball.\\n\\n\r\nHope that helped.",

I HATE baseball.  I really don't like it.  So I didn't plan on watch a 50 episode anime based around the sport.  Nevertheless, I got bored, and watched the first episode, knowing that there was some romance in it.  Childhood romance!  I love that.  But then, the girl who I figured was the love interest dies.  Right in the first episode!  I had no ideawhat to expect.  So, of course, I had to watch the next one to see how it would play out.  So I continued to watch each episode.  Before I knew it, I began to actually like baseball.\\n\\n\r\nCross Game is a series were you can't help but get a big stupid grin on your face because the characters are just so awesome.  You can't help but fall in love with the main characters and just want more.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you watch this anime, it becomes obvious at what is going to happen at the end.  But that doesn't stop you, because it is HOW they get to that destination that is so great.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line is, this anime is fantastic.  My favorite anime of all time.  If you are looking for an anime filled with intense moments, funny characters and a cute romance, Cross Game is the one for you",

            "content": "Cross Game is absolutely one of the best anime shows (not just sports anime) that I've seen. Period. It is another masterpiece written by Mitsuru Adachi (of Touch and H2 fame). From the first episode (which is absolutely heartbreaking and a must-watch), the show just captures the viewers attention and never lets go. The best part is that Cross Game is that it is about more than just baseball. It is a story about dealing with the death of a loved one (it has a very similar feeling to AnoHana), friendship, and how two people grow and nurture each other through hardships and successes. Itis honestly more like a wonderful SOL/romance/comedy that has an emphasis on baseball too.\\n\\n\r\nThe story may be a little bit predictable at times, but Cross Game is more about the total journey. Don't be intimidated by the length. Time flies and there really are no filler episodes (except for one recap episode) and by the end, I was wishing that the show would never end. The characters are truly what make this show exceptional and Aoba is one of my favorite female protagonists of all time. She is way more than just a tsundere and has so much depth to her character. Do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece. It'll have you on the edge of seat the whole time.\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10",

Yet, I was expecting a sports anime, and could not have been happier with what I received instead. This is not a pure sports anime in the same sense as Ace of the Diamond, for example.  That is fine, however, because anything that can be so easily placed in a shallow category such as \"Sport\" is going to itself be shallow.\r\nCross Game is more of a trip of emotions. This is about a few core characters, about their relationships with each other,with their families, with their teammates. And it is quite the journey. We have plenty of time to see our characters grow, to see their low moments, and to see their highs. Many of the most emotional moments take place both on and away from the grounds.\\n\\n\r\nIt is definitely about baseball. However, in the end, it is also a story about a bunch of high-schoolers growing up. And while high school is overused as a setting in anime, it is helped by the fact that most of the important moments take place either some kind of baseball grounds, or away from the school.\\n\\n\r\nThere is little more to say without leaving major spoilers. However, I would urge anyone who has some interest in baseball to watch at least a few episodes, and see if they like it. This is one of the best stories I have had the pleasure to experience, period.",

            "content": "This is the first anime that is written by Adachi sensei which lead me to his other works and ended up loving them. If you take a look at my profile, Adachi sensei is my favourite creator alongside his other works ended up as my favorites manga and anime. But, let's focus on Cross Game first.\r\nStory:\r\nAt the rating part, i would have given this 12/10 if possible, why? Because the story is just too outstanding. Who said sport + romance and a little bit slice of life ended up as a boring subject? Well you might be wrong, cross game has proved it. Focusing onKitamura Kou in fulfilling his promise with Wakaba to become a pitcher as good as Aoba. Well, that's what Cross Game is all about. While focusing on that part, a lot of things happen, drama, friendship, and even too-many-sided romance. All of that things mixed in one baseball based masterpiece anime. Jump aside from its main plot, the character development with 50 episodes is done perfectly. No more question left alongside the characters plot and background, and also there's no sudden power up in this anime, but beware of the shounen tag (you know what i mean).\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is great and matched enough with the vibes of this series. It's not too bright like Violet Evergarden, Clannad, Kimi no Na Wa, etc, but it's good enough to support the positive vibes of this series. The art is okay, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOMG this is another positive point of this anime. The OP song is just too great and not boring at all, eventhough it is used from the 1st episode and the last episode. The ED also, all of them are good-to-listen music and some of them really matched the plot in the series, for example \"Koikogarete Mita Yume\", the 1st ED song, does match and even increase the whole vibe in one biggest and important plot in this series, no further explanation because it might spoil the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nLovable. All of the character in this series lovable enough despite its art which is not Kimi no Na wa enough. Why? because the personality of each character is placed and played well enough. Eventhough there's shounen tag, but trust me the MC is not that shounen enough to ruin the entire series (you know what i mean). Even there's one character which is only shown in some episodes but its role affect the others character until the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI truly enjoy this anime from the 1st episode until the last episode. Laugh, cry, anger, heart-touching, and all others feeling are expressed in this baseball based anime. No part is dissapointing enough to make me hate this series. Masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, i would say this is one of the most underrated anime that needs more attention. How can a series which is this great doesn't get enough appreciation? C'mon this drama nowadays need to learn from this anime.\\n\r\nOh yeah, i would say one more thing. This anime doesn't focus too much on the baseball, so pay attention to other tags which is most likely the most suitable tag on this series.",

            "content": "This is going to be a short review. I think most people here have already said what's good about the show, which I won't repeat, but I'll have to agree that this is one special show that strikes a home run straight from a heart-wrenching first episode, and never looks back after that. It's like Prince of Tennis, mixed with a good underdog story and well thought-out drama that is sorely lacking in most shonen anime. It's a great anime to watch if you like sports, and after watching 14 episodes, I just know it'll get better.\r\nThe reason I wrote this review, however, is tohighlight the point that reviews here don't really mention, and where I think the anime really shines: the music. I'm not talking about the OPs and EDs, although I must say they are really great, especially the first ED. What I really think is amazing is the BGM used here. This show reminds me of a Japanese drama, Proposal Daisakusen, in the style of music used. The impression I got from that show was that every dramatic, emotional or adrenaline pumping scene was always accompanied with the perfect song, and at the perfect timing. The BGM here is of a good variety; they go well with most scenes. The ones that really catch my attention, however, are the scenes where the characters reminisce about Wakaba. These few songs that are reused (a pity I don't know the song titles) really stand out, and their timing is perfect. In fact, they stand out so much that every time the songs play, I know it's going to be emotional, sometimes even before I know what the scene is about. This is one of the shows where the script and scenario planning are not absolutely fantastic, but the impact and timing of the BGM makes many scenes really memorable. In that sense I feel the music, while not the most appreciated, is the best part of the show. I really can't wait to get my hands on the OST, if it is ever released.\\n\\n\r\nMy advice to anybody watching the show now, and anybody planning to watch the show in the future: stick your ear out to hear for the BGM at every scene you can, feel the atmosphere of the scenes, and appreciate the goodness that Koutarou Nakagawa (the composer) has presented us with.",

            "content": "First off let me start by saying that this I don't usually make reviews and this is my first one. \r\nEnjoyment: The reason I liked this anime is because of it's first episode. Out of all the anime I like, I can easily say that this had the best first episode. It usually takes up 20 episodes or so to make an episode this good. Of course Cross game is a really good series but more importantly I would recommend everyone to watch the first episode. This anime like you would guess is about baseball and is able to capture not only the people wholove sports anime but also people who like romantic and sad anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIn my opinion, most good sport anime usually have emotion as their base which is what makes Cross game is different. The story is mainly about romance,family, and sports. It is about the importance of the past and how it affects the future.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSince this show bases it's story on the past, the art is a bit kiddish which I really shows how important the past. Initially I really didn't like, after watching the anime I think it's the perfect choice of art for this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThere is not much sound which I found surprising cause I was looking for osts after I finished the anime. I liked the first ending and think that the openings were also really good\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAnother really good point of this anime is that you can never tell what the characters were thinking. It was as though you were inside the anime itself\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I think this anime is great. Even though you don't have time to watch the anime, I'd really recommend the first episode to you as a must watch episode\\n",

            "content": "First off I'm going to say, along with all of the other Animes that I've completed (E.g. Major, Eyeshield 21 Ect.), I really hated the ending because it marked the end of one of my favorite Animes. \r\nCross Game\r\nFrom the very beginning it was something that caught my interest. By the end of the first episode, I knew the story was going to be beautiful, yes, Beautiful. I may be a guy but I'm a sucker for good drama in an Anime, I got what I wanted, it's a perfect anime for anyone who is into sports and enjoys a good story line. I enjoyAnimes like HOTD with no real story line, and when you think of baseball in an anime, you think boring anime that's about some kid that grows up to be the best in the world, That is not Cross Game, It's needed that the Main Character be the best player on his team, but the fact that they also focus on the drama part and who the characters end up becoming in the end really deserves 2 thumbs up. Anyway to the Overall Review, it's highly recommended by me, A love story with some drama, Definitely some tear jerking moments, but dont get me wrong, this anime revolves around Baseball and the main characters perseverance. My favorite part has to be when he throws the 160 km/h fastball (100 miles per hour), its the part where you can finally believe he gets the girl lol. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 Art could have been better, everything else was there, I Tip my hat to the creator.",

            "content": "This was the first work by Mitsuru Adachi that I've had the pleasure of viewing. It is also fair to say this is probably the best slice of life anime I have ever seen.\r\n-Story-\r\nAs I've come to learn Adachi-sensei has a knack for picking the same concepts and just replacing minor aspects of it. For instance, this series has similar elements to his earlier work Touch. The most amazing thing about it though is that regardless of whether the story is original, or how predictable it gets, he continually draws you in, forcing you to watch one more episode. The first episode in itself justslaps you across the face wondering what the hell just happened. It gives you the sense that \"this is going to be something great.\"\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nThe art of the series may put some people off, but it's easily something you can get used to or over look.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this series is a great example of a supporting pillar. The music always seems t fit the mood and keeps your ears open. The opening and ending themes all fit well with the series an overall, it made this series that much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nThis is where Cross Game absolutely shines; no, scratch that, it BLINDS you with the characters. I have always believed that a story is more believable when the characters in it don't feel like they are being guided by the story but the story is guided by them. Meaning that the actions the characters take, their feelings, the relationships, the lines, the thoughts, everything regarding the characters makes them seem like they could be actual people. In fact, if I could give this a grade of 13 I would.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nFans  of the show will agree that there is a whirlwind of emotion that accompanies this series that will only leave you wanting more. The thing is, the ending is just so utterly satisfying that you don't want to spoil the memory of such a great series by dragging it out. When the series ended I cursed the fact that such a great series had come to an end, that I no longer could see into the lives of the characters I loved so much. Then you realize that there was just no better way of ending the series.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\nThis is a series I hope to pass on to my friends, family and children. It's the kind of series you want to keep living on with your being. There are very few series out there I'd be willing to call a \"masterpiece\" but the title has been earned.",

This one is the best, so i figured it to be an anime. \r\nOkey details to the story, first episode tell us about main character prologue when he was a child, how meaningful his childhood . After the prologue the story told us about a high schoolboy who really didn't like to play baseball and didn't even plan to doing it. Times after times the story changed. Complicated love story between him and childhood friends, and also great friendship among the character. There is also humor in this anime, and it was Adachi Mitsuru's style.\\n\\n\r\nSo far so good, i also get recomendation from my friend who gets recomendation and its mostly recomended for you. Stay tune to anime ! :)",

            "content": "TL:DR review: \r\nFor all intents and purposes, Cross game can be seen as an alternate world retelling of Anohana. In this world, instead of slice-of-life we have baseball as the focus of the show and instead of angst ridden characters of Anohana you have more grounded, well rounded characters deal with the same themes of loss, lonliness and identifying one'e self worth. Watch if you like slice of life. As a sports anime it works, but its mostly about the characters and less about the sport itself. \r\nFull review:\r\nI liked Anohana for what it was, a story of loss and coming to terms with missingyour first love. However I was almost turned off by the ludicrous characters on display. Cross Game does it miles better as its characters arent prone to self-pity nor do they burden themselves with needless regret just to add drama. The characters for the most part simply move on as most people would do in such ciscumstances. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Cross Game in 5 mins is essentially lead character Ko and neighbor Wakaba both of whom were born on the same day like each other a lot. This causes a lot of anger on the part of Wakaba's younger sister Aoba. A tragic accident causes the death of Wakaba and the anime deals with how Kou moves on with his life while still interacting with the rest of Wakaba's family namely her 3 sisters, Aoba, Momiji and Ichiyo. The characters all are fairly realistic in that they still miss Wakaba but dont wallow in self-pity but rather choose to look towards the future. Along the side there is baseball which is a big passion in Aoba's life. Why Ko decides to take up baseball as a sport and how his relationship with Aoba progresses forms the crux of the story. Make no mistake about it, Cross Game has elements of baseball in it and it has tropes used in other similar sports anime, however the focus here is on the relationship between Ko and Aoba and the other characters from the baseball team. The baseball story is more of a side arc rather than the major focus. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters of Cross Game for the most part. The one character I didnt like was Wakaba. She is potrayed as this perfect girl who is loved by all the boys and idolized by everyone. Noone had beef with her, she was universally loved... essentially the same garbage we were fed about Menma in Anohana. The difference is that in Anohana, Menma returned as a retarded ghost whereas here Wakaba stays thankfully dead for most part of the anime. I say most part because Wakana returns towards the later part of the series as clone-trooper 6191 AKA Akane. Apparently another girl who just happens to look exactly like Wakaba with the exact same character traits like Wakaba just happens to move next door to Ko and Aoba. I will let the mathematicians in the house calculate the odds of that happening. This clone-trooper also gets her own \"Your lie in April\" arc at the very end to add some needless drama. Wew lads. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully the rest of the cast for the most part are fun. Ko is very grounded for a sport anime protagonist. He isnt a whiny, loud-mouthed, never give up, thug-life guy with massive hidden potential (looking at you Shoyo Hina-fart!!) He didnt start playing baseball to become the best in the world but rather for reasons much closer to home. He plays baseball simply to fulfill a dream Wakaba had. Even towards the end, he wants to be the best pitcher in the world not because he wants to be the best but its the only way he knows to get closer to Aoba. Aoba is another star in the show. Classic tsundere type, fighitng desparately to be part of the dream Wakaba had all the while hurting inside coz she knows she would never be part of a boys baseball team. She loves baseball but she wants so badly to part of the Wakaba's dream that she puts her baseball dreams on hold so she could atleast cheer on Ko from the sidelines. Great character growth throught and the banter between Ko and Aoba is generally of a very good quality. Some of the side characters themselves are very well rounded with a good example being Akaishi. Another guy who had a silent crush on Wakaba, reforms himself from being a bully to become a catcher so he can help make Wakaba's dream a reality. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are good. The character desings are a bit umm.. You take Ko, Aoba and Wakaba/Akane and shave them all bald, they all have the same face. The backgrounds are serviceable. The animation however is very good. The music is entirely forgettable. It does its job of staying in the background. Not a single track was actually memorable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclution: \\n\r\nCross game is easy waching. Its not a bad thing. There are no complex multi layered characters. The biggest takeaway is the undeniable feelings of positivty one gets from watching this. Anohana was mostly negative with a positive ending. Here the tone of the anime is by and large positive and the life potrayed here is charming and brimming with childlike innocence. The message is of hope, to cherish the memories of those you lost but to move on and not be held back by your loss. Lovely anime, not the most original story and some characters and the drama they bring (aka Akane) was uneeded but overall great.",

Baseball is merely a setting to tell the main story, which is a bunch of really likable characters dealing with going through high school and dealing with tragedy.\r\nArt: idk 10\r\nI just really like how shit-eating everybody looks.

It doesn't do that with dramatic tracks, but with subtle but very evident musical cues. Great at gradually building up and releasing tension sort of like breathing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAs a Slice of Life, the characters are the key component and Cross Game hits it out of the park. Characters have realistic motivations outside of the plot, feel natural, grow in meaningful ways, and are all likable in the end. Villians, while evil in a black and white sense, are believable in their own right. I'm not including challenges or obstacles in the plot as villains, as they just seem like more friends. \\n\r\nSometimes it feels like a certain trope, but it never feels like it's dragging due to various obstacles and the characters' focus on their own goals. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nhad fun.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nI\u2019m a sucker for slice-of-life stories, and this one was no exception (especially because it also contained action and romance = ++fav). The (not-so) subtle references to the past gave the anime a nice emotional aura to it (in fact, some scenes were so subtly emotional that I teared). Being my first sports-related anime, I found it to be surprisingly interesting, with a lot of suspense and excitement, particularly during the baseball matches. I was not content with the ending (but I won\u2019t spoil that for you). I felt that it was rushed\u2026 especially the some-what cliche romance at the end. I was also abit let down with the 160k/hr fastball pitch as I was expecting a MUCH more exhilarating execution. Pity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the first episode, I was a bit put off by the character design (majorly monkey-like ears), but the less appealing features gradually wore off during the anime (slight inconsistency by the animators?) and the classic designs started to grow on me (even that of Mizuki Asami, whom I initally disliked because of his very similar features to the main male character Kou Kitamura). Development of the personae was impeccably done and so you end up loving even the minor characters. As I mentioned before, I was not entirely happy with the romance at the end. It left me puzzled as to why the mains thought the way they did, e.g. why she said he was \u2018the most hateful person\u2019. Bad subbing? I doubt it\u2026 SubSmith did a pretty good job\u2026 (though ANBU was better, pity they only subbed the beginning eps) Reckon I\u2019ll have to rewatch that last episode to fully understand.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe clean subtlety-ness of the art enabled the watcher to focus on the story, instead of getting distracted by itty-bitty-irrelevant stuff in the background. Not much to say about the background designs, evidently because they weren\u2019t the standout feature. The \u2018omg\u2019 factor was in fact the depiction of the baseball players. Despite keeping to the simple character design, the mangaka (Mitsuru Adachi) was still able to superbly portray their physical movements and that was an essential part to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs suited the anime very well. However, by far, the best song in the series was \u2018Koi Kogartete Mita Yume\u2019 by Ayaka. Slow-paced and sweet, even though I don\u2019t understand japanese, the melody made me reminisce about the past\u2026 and cross game, of course.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWithout doubt, this is by far one of the best animes that I\u2019ve seen in a long time. Being a huge fan of Rumiko Takahashi\u2019s works (i.e. InuYasha, Ranma 1/2), having similar character designs to her definitely put Mitsuru Adachi on the must-watch list, and now that I\u2019ve seen his work, I can safely say that he\u2019s also entered the fav-mangaka list as well.\\n",

I didn't expect much out of this anime, but instead I got one of my favourites. \r\nStory-9\r\nThe story isn't really anything new or creative, granted it isn't something that it seen everyday. For the most part however, you could see what would happen each time, but that doesn't stop it from being enjoyable. While the story, (at least in my opinion) is very well done, it isn't quite the part that stands out most for me. \r\nArt-9\r\nIf you have just picked up more recent and pretty looking anime, the art may notlook all that appealing to you, but even if thats the case, the art style will grow on you. I think that this style especially was very well chosen for this anime. Just like it the art isn't too serious, but doesn't quite give the feeling of a more comedic show. Not too many harsh lines, and while I am no expert on this, I found the art to be well done. \\n\\n\r\nSound-8 \\n\r\nI am very bad at analyzing sound, I can't tell a good song from a bad one. I can't even tell if notes are out of place. Really, if you want an in-depth review of the sound, I advise you read another review. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nI found that the characters were really what stood out to me. This story does have a time lapse so there is quite a bit of change in terms of characters right there. Also however, during the story the characters slowing change. Especially the relationships that characters would have with each other. This show had 50 episodes to stretch that over, which I personally enjoyed. The changes were gradual and seemingly quite natural. I also feel that Cross Game went into other characters lives besides the main character's, something I feel that many anime fail to do. This adds much more depth to the story, and overall just makes it more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10 \\n\r\nThe reason I picked this anime up was not actually for the sports, but rather for the characters. Because of this I personally enjoyed this show very much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-10\\n\r\nJust saying, this show isn't for everyone, no anime is. However, if you want an anime about baseball, or maybe just want an interesting show with a bit of romance, then this show would be a good one to watch.",

Although the show can be a bit slow-paced, perhaps too homely and believable, there hasn't been a show that hooked me so easily and kept me interested in awhile.

The characters are given room to breathe and we observe them rather than them having to voice out everything they\u2019re thinking. It also understands the importance of time to deal with suffering. In the very first episode, we\u2019re witness to a tragedy (the scene where the main character realizes what happened is one of the best scenes I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime), and it\u2019s that absence that provides an anchor to the show. Cross Game also  gives great importance to objects and their significance as time passes (just think of the clocksthat the main character uses or the list that he has hanging up on his wall) that\u2019s worthy of Ozu. Honestly, it\u2019s shows like this that make me believe in the beauty of long-form narrative storytelling. You just can\u2019t do something like this in a movie. The final episode\u2019s realization, thanks to the years of pain and suffering, of glances, of small encounters, hits you like a ton; and then the final image is perfect, a metaphorical simplicity that is just beautiful, anything is possible. Why must you know more? Beautifully realized, impeccably written, a small miracle. Will you believe?\\n\\n\r\ncopied/pasted from my blog: www.thenextthingblog.wordpress.com",

            "content": "I loved it.  At first, I thought the mc were little kids, and I was kind of averse to it (since it probably would be more of a kids show then), but the story is about them in the past and present point of the characters lives, from grade school to junior high to high school.  \r\nThe story wasn't bad.  It isn't a hardcore sports anime like Haikyuu or Kuroko's Basketball.  It is about baseball and it does show competition episodes but it also involves themes like family and romance that isn't exactly tied to baseball very strongly like the hardcoresports anime that have everything revolve around the sport.  \\n\\n\r\nI watched this anime because it was recommended to me as a romance option to binge.  To be completely honest, at first I was like, this doesn't really have any romance at all.  I mean, yes, they do talk about relationships and romance but it isn't apparent in the show.  Near the later quarter of the series though, romance becomes more of an apparent theme.  It is still an undertone but it grows heavier and heavier as the purpose and call for the romance between the mcs become more and more critical to define who the mcs are and why they do what they do.  I have complaints about the way they showed it but I also loved that they did the romance this way too.  It sets this anime apart from the usual romance animes that puts everything out in the open.  \\n\\n\r\nArt wise, I don't really have complaints about it.  Very simple facial structures, though.  Different then the art that I'm used to.  \\n\r\nSound wise, no complaints either.  You see, I'm not very picky when it comes to sound.\\n\r\nCharacters wise, no complaints.  My only opinion is that, the anime seems to try to convey depth but you don't really get where the deepness is, if you get what I mean.  You can feel that they are trying to convey depth but you don't know what it's trying to convey...kinda hard to explain.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment wise, if you can't tell, I loved it.  It wasn't awesome but it definitely is a good anime on my scale.  I would recommend it and rewatch it, if I feel like it.\\n",

            "content": "So, this is my fourth review of an anime ever and I've just finished the anime a few hours ago so bear with me as I sort out my thoughts a bit. \r\nI liked Cross Game, I'm not completely sure why. It has a lot of things that I normally like in anime but most of them didn't grasp me as much as they could have. Maybe it's because it was about baseball, which I know nothing about. Or maybe the emotions didn't hit me as hard expressed in it's back to basic art. I still liked it a lot, though, I got through it's50 episodes in no time and if you know my habits you know that I really do just drop the ones I don't like as soon as I've had enough of them, which is often two episodes in. \\n\\n\r\nNOT REALLY ANY SPOILERS!!\\n\\n\r\nYES, I DID LIKE THIS ANIME\\n\r\nI do like my love stories slow and realistic, that's what probably struck a chord with me. I like a love between two people who actually know each other deeply, and trust each other on a very instinctive level. Passion is good, but not as good as that feeling of having a rock in the crazy storm of life, and just being willing to work for a relationship can make it so much more real. \\n\\n\r\nJust like the art the anime is simple, back to basic, nice to watch, cute and funny, but simple. I'm sure other people found more meaning in this anime than I did and there is that layer that kept me watching, but I can't figure out what it is exactly. Maybe because it's very basic it feels honest, without a lot of decoration, both visually and emotionally. Even though I guess it deals with a story that could have been a lot more complicated it all happens very naturally, slowly but steadily.\\n\r\nI liked the story, I like that the drama isn't painted so dramatically and I like the way the story works and develops the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt has a lot of nice characters, I mean nice in the actual sense. I don't like it when anime's put in mean people for no reason other than trying to make you root for the main character more, like with rivals in love or in a game. They really have no function being mean if the couple you are rooting for is actually in love, or if the person you are rooting for to win is actually the best. They will figure that out even if their rivals are the nicest people in the world. I like that Cross Game avoided a lot of people being mean just for the hell of it. \\n\\n\r\nWHAT I NEVER REALLY GOT\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like about this anime. Well, I think the art was a little too simple, simple is good but when you find yourself wondering what the expressions on peoples faces are supposed to be, it's a little too simple for me. I didn't have that a lot but the points where facial expressions are supposed to present words unsaid are often the most important parts, and also the parts that sometimes left me a little confused. \\n\\n\r\nI had a few character issues, too. The male lead, though showing some character development, seems very unchanged to me, while a lot happens that could have given him more depth. He always seems to have some sort of control over his emotions, giving us little insight into him and, me personally, not a lot of reasons to love him. I did love the female lead who makes up for that lack of emotional connection easily. There's also a little to many comic relief characters for my taste, and some characters just sticking around after sort of being done playing their part. A lot of screen time seems to be lost that could have been spend on me getting to know the important characters a little better.\\n\\n\r\nThe baseball thing. I think this might be a personal issue seeing as I've never really been into sports but I just didn't really get it, I cared because my characters cared, but I didn't actually care myself. I have watched a few other shows and anime about ambition, passion and a business wouldn't really have cared about going into it, but a lot of those have a way of getting me to love what they do, making me curious about it. Cross Game didn't really explain to me in it's own way why people love baseball, it just gave me characters to love that loved it, and that's not enough for me, once I spend that much time with it I want to understand why. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, I found the ending a little bit confusing, but that's probably because I like my endings to tie up all loose ends and I know that's not very realistic but it made me feel a bit unfinished. It wasn't as though there's this great plot hole that needed addressing or something just a slight bit of insecurity about the ending.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL \\n\r\nOverall I found it very enjoyable (I know that sounds condescending, it's not meant to be) and I would recommend it to basically anyone because I think a lot of people can find stuff in it they like. This is not one of my favorite anime's, though, because I like my characters to dig a little deeper, and because I there's a lot of things that I can't get myself to care about. But it's a good story with nice characters and I had fun watching it :)",

I usually don't write reviews,but I just had to write a review for this one!\r\nStory:10\r\nI know,there are many people who watched the anime but dropped it because they thought :\u02ddthis anime is nice,but baseball is not my thing,and I don't get it at all\u02dd. I thought the same thing,but wrong!! I watched about 10 episodes and I was really about to drop it,but I gave it one more chance with 2-3 episodes,just because of the opening. I thought:\u02ddthis anime can't be bad with this awesome opening\u02dd. And thanks God I gave it one more chance,it become one ofmy favourite anime of all time.\\n\r\nIt's not just about baseball,I know,baseball is one of the main genres there,but baseball is the thing that connects all the characters there,and it made it so awesome. If you're a fan of romance,drama and flashbacks,you shoud watch Cross Game. It had so many emotional scenes,dramatic and romantic scenes,and in the end ,you will understand some rules of baseball,even though it's not your thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nThe art is not modern,with that loli and moe animation.It has the old anime style (80s and 90s),but just in better quality. I loved the animations. The episodes were always in good quality. So,if you wouldn't watch this anime because of the animation,don't do it,please! You'll get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nCross Game has an awesome sports and drama slice of life soundtrack!\\n\r\nBut it's so bad I can't find the OSTs anywhere,so if anyone knows some page where I can hear them,please tell me ;)\\n\r\nThe opening is,like I said ,so good! the endings are also very good,awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:10\\n\r\nThe characters are good,with their own character. I really liked Aoba.She's one of my favourite anime slice of life female characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nAt first,it was mostly about baseball,but later everything else is included. I couldn't stop watching,how good it was. It's just,wow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched Cross Game yet,and you're a fan of sports,romance,drama you definitely shouldn't miss this masterpiece. It's so sad this anime is not more popular,even though it's good ranked on MAL.\\n\r\nI recommend Cross Game with all my heart,to all of you who like sport,drama romance. And if you don't like it at first( because of baseball),don't drop it,give it a chance,at least watch it to episode 15-20 :)",

            "content": "Here we have another Adachi-sensei's manga adaptation. The author obviously developed which resulted into such a splendid story. I'm far from being a baseball fan and understanding the mesmerizing charm of the game (which, to be honest, seems more of a boredom to me), yet it hadn't prevented me from enjoying what was going on a single time. The characters are bright, and living, and seeking, and loving. The series tell us a story of nearly entire life, showing how someone grows up, and someone breaks down, but then finds something to make them move forward. It's not quite about sport, but the sport playsan important part here, especially in that marvellous Tsukishima-Kitamura line. There are lost of little trifles which turn out to be units from a single puzzle. One more thing the staff learns here is to quit in time: the story ends where it really should, thus it feels quite balanced. To me, there are way too many episodes here yet I re-watched it with no lesser a pleasure than I had for the first time. Oh, and I liked the music here, at times it was adorable.",
