            "content": "When it comes to video game adaptations, there\u2019s an incentive when it comes to please fans. Blade & Soul is a good example based off a game and one that failed to live up to any expectations. Based off a Korean MMORPG game produced by NC Soft, there\u2019s a truckload of problems I find that didn\u2019t do well when adapting such a genre. But really, Blade & Soul isn\u2019t anything special especially when the main characters are generic to the core. It\u2019s soulless per se.\r\nFor starters, we get a fantasy setting with beautiful landscapes and the feeling that you\u2019re actually in a fictional world. That\u2019sthe initial impression the show first makes but it quickly loses its praise when we are introduced to its cast of characters \u2013 beautiful women wearing skimpy outfits. One such character is named Alka, with a very cold personality and a thirst for vengeance. From the beginning, we find out that she\u2019s on a quest, to deliver vengeance as a way of revenge as result of someone that killed her master. Although the premise sounds promising, it derides itself with its setup when most of Alka\u2019s persona is setup as solely being a warrior. As the titular character, she wields a dangerous blade along with a tattoo for a gimmick. And if that wasn\u2019t clich\u00e9 enough, she is hunted down as a bounty that countries has set up to claim her head on a plate.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, Alka suffers not just from characterization but also value, a sense that makes people underappreciate what she is doing. In the beginning, she is chased by some soldiers with guns (yes, guns in a series when blades are a prominent feature). But of course, she is able to avoid death with superhuman feats. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, it all happens far too fast and makes the audience wonder what this purpose is. Really, a girl with a soulless personality wielding a blade and on a quest for vengeance should deliver more than just showing off her moves. The only hint we do get is some of the flashbacks we see between Alka and her master. Unfortunately, it feels subtle and lacking compassion because we don\u2019t feel attached to their relationship. And speaking of relationships, Alka is on a sinking ship when it comes to forming one with any character. Literally, almost every character she meets during her quest dies. In retrospect, she is walking death flag that triggers your fate of doom.\\n\\n\r\nAs refined as the premise may be, the show feels less more of an adventure or quest but more like a cat and mouse game. From the first episode, it\u2019s clear that many people want Alka\u2019s head on a plate. Although she hunts Jin Varel (her master\u2019s murderer), Alka becomes the hunted nearly every episode with pursuers. For a girl with such a cold personality, she doesn\u2019t hesitate to defend herself and draws out meaningless fights. The action itself feels lifeless and solely seems to function as a way to show that Alka needs to survive in order to carry out her revenge. In short, Alka is a character that is hard to get attached to or sympathize about. In fact, many people in this show suffered more than she has so why does she get any more special acclaim?\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast members doesn\u2019t do much well with their characterization either. For instance, there\u2019s Dan Roana who serves as the leader of the Pleasure Gang, a group that opposes the Palam Empire. While their motivations are different, its goal is the same as Alka; to carry out revenge for what they did in the past. Clich\u00e9 as it sounds, the show also neglects any development as the premise of revenge is delivered with a lack of emotional attachment. Similarly, most characters seems to have mental breakdowns or suffered some sort of grim past. The key failure here is not just a lack of attachment the audience will feel distanced from but their characterization. Almost nothing is explained by some of the characters\u2019 motivations and their stale influence towards Alka\u2019s adventures is hardly memorable. Similarly, antagonists are generic with stereotypical inspirations and in general, a lack of focus in their persona. On the other hand, there\u2019s some character development but not on Alka. Instead, they only come and then soon goes away like the wind as characters are killed by this show\u2019s shenanigans. \\n\\n\r\nAs an adventurous series, the story is also plagued with weak direction and senseless action. There\u2019s little purpose to what most of the characters do throughout each episode. For delivering a series about survival and revenge, there\u2019s a lackluster development in any sense for Alka. It genuinely dismiss any sort of change with her character because her soulless personality. Even when the show tries to deliver some charisma such as Jin Hazuki\u2019s bounty hunting ways, it ultimately fails to achieve its general purpose. It\u2019s just the basic face value of the hunter and the hunted. Only the strongest survive and the weak perish. It\u2019s generic and lacks melancholy from a series that could be potentially thought tearing. You won\u2019t be shedding tears during Alka\u2019s quest of revenge but rather confusion and despair, the action of shaking your head and wonder where this all goes to in the end. And speaking of endings, the show functions like a time bomb that explodes with destructive results, almost laughable by the conclusive episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe only hopes saving this show is its world concept and civilization. Its landscapes are beautiful and the world this show takes place in has a diverse population, especially in terms of races. Unfortunately, none of that really becomes a focus because the majority of the show focuses on Alka and her adventure. With a lack of world building and character dynamics, the only other noticeable feature I can say for this show would be the action. Because it adapts a serious tone with minimal comedy, the action can be a hit and miss. On some scenarios, it is honest with integrity and well-coordinated movements. The way Alka fights proves credibility of her worth and the violence itself is explicitly true to this show\u2019s grim atmosphere. Otherwise, it can feel forceful and devoid of attractiveness when it feels repetitive. Some action scenes are also motivated by a lack of focus in its writing and to be honest, this show just fails to deliver its intentions. Hey, it even tries to do that with some terminology overview at the end of each episode. The key word here is \u2018try\u2019 because for whatever reason, they are usually left out from the main story. Shrug.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fantasy series, the production studio Gonzo focuses primarily on bringing this show\u2019s world to life. And based on visuals, it does live up to its promise when it comes to artistic values and artwork. The world is decorated with thought provoking imagery and beautiful landscapes. Many of its structures also brings the feel of a fantasy to home. Character designs are also flamboyant and crafted to fit with the show\u2019s premise.  On the other hand, fan service is present throughout every episode whether it\u2019s the camera angles, revealing outfits, or female character designs that makes them look more voluptuous than they should be. Oh and violence always become a centerpiece at every angle in the show so expect blood pouring like rice.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is hardly noticeable and the only time they seem to hold any promise is during action scenes when climatic events happen. The OST just seems to fade in the background with little emotional value because the way direction characters are drawn out. The cries and agony of despair can only be sympathized when we feel attached to the characters so most of their portrayals feels hollow. The scream of pain and despair feels empty with thoughtlessness. For Alka, her voice is hardly memorable as nearly every conversation she has with others feels monotonous and lacks feeling. The only credit I can give to the soundtrack would be the ED song for its symbolism, style (with the decorative dancing), and catchy tone. Otherwise, it\u2019s nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nBlade & Soul is a disappointment and a show that you should not come in with high expectations. What you get is an emotionless girl that I doubt anyone will feel attached to. Her quest feels hollow with little value besides to deliver her vengeance. Mindless entertainment is what you get from this show\u2019s fragile story and incoherent developments. Forget the majority of the characters because none of them really stands out for more than an episode besides Alka. And while technical visual aspects saves the show from total destruction, it\u2019s still hard to salvage from its own delivery. Such a shame too with a beautiful fantasy world at hand but everything that ultimately delivered is just a big ball of broken gadgets. Be aware.\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER WARNING**\r\nAt first, this series seemed to be extremely intriguing. I liked the premise of the story, and the art/animation style is gorgeous. But unfortunately, for a majority of the series, that's the only thing that I could say positive.\r\nAlka is an assassin for the Clan of the Sword. She's on a journey to find Jin Varrel, who killed her master Hon. Jin is a demon-like woman who controls the Energy of Chaos and kills without feeling, which is similar to how Alka has learned to kill in her work as an assassin. On her journey, Alka meets three gorgeous, strange women, each a greatwarrior in her own right and grapples with her slain master's wish that she leave the life of an assassin behind.\\n\\n\r\nSounds promising right? This series has great potential. But, it develops far too slowly for me. The action, when it does show, is very exciting. But does not occur frequently enough. Like most series, there are flashbacks and back stories that are needed to be shown. Unfortunately, I feel as if it took way too much time, and deviated from the primary plot too often.\\n\\n\r\nI feel as if the series relied too often on the bombshell beauties' looks to maintain the viewers attention. Yes, the female characters are gorgeous. But that can only take a series so far. That being said, the animation style used is outstanding. I thought the colors used really conveyed to the mood of each situation/episode. Same could be said of the music.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a wonderfully animated series with some great characters. Some great action. But far too much emphasis on the gorgeous (big breasted) characters looks.The series was very slow to develop, and was boring at times.",

The story is based around a girl named Alka, who belongs to the infamous Sword clan.  A clan known for being extremely dangerous and are usually hired assassins. At first it seems like something promising, then the next episode disappoints you, and then the next and then the next. \r\n5/10\r\nART: The art in this anime isn't something that should be talked about.

Nothing really stood out, especially the ending, which I found embarrassing to watch for reasons that I don't fully understand yet.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The characters seemed promising, until everyone else besides the Main Character developed throughout the anime. Of course the only time the Main Character develops into a decent human being isn't until the end.

            "content": "Perhaps a thing of note is that Blade and Soul does not look nor feel like a video game (as one might have expected), just your standard fantasy fare with the magics, totally not loli/shota/furries and stuffs. Blade and Soul is essentially another Queen's Blade... You know, as in, lots of sword wielding thots and... stuffs. Though, it's nowhere near as sexually rampant as Queen's Blade. Instead, in it's place, Blade and Soul can manage to be more retarded. Whatever semblance of an actual story there may have been has surely been bastardized; but to what extent has it been butchered I wouldn't know. Andit seems like I will never know for certain either since NCsoft will never make an English release of the damn game. In any case, what we have here are heavy handed conflict and resolutions, and a plethora of awkward brief as well as irrelevant flashbacks (except perhaps the flashbacks we see between Alka and her master) that happen for something the show is entirely alien to. A thing called \"emotion\".\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not to say that Blade and Soul is particularly painful to watch. No, you'll be able to marathon this with relative ease. You will at least not feel like your mind is being relentlessly cut to tiny pieces by an utterly shat-upon pacing and heaps and mountains of contrivances. It still pretty much has every other problem that typically plagues a video-game anime-adaption, though. \\n\\n\r\nWhich now brings us to the characters. One loli, three or four shotas, a wannabee cutesy stubborn drunk girl who suddenly turns to psycho bitch and back, a lady bar owner whose not afraid to get her hands dirty and is supposed to play the wise old hag yet is nothing of the sort.... Ugh, why am I even trying? One of the bad guys is a muscle bound oaf that does nothing but grunt! Everyone here changes whatever semblance of a personality they have as the plot demands it, particularly in the case of the obnoxious drunk girl and bar owner to jarring effect. And especially in the case with our dear lead Alka, she plays the role of the done-to-death assassin. One whose apparently supposed to be cool precisely because she's humorless and cold to the point where she might as well be holding a giant poster sign saying, \"Please ask me the following question: 'are you even human?', thanks!\". Only in her case, someone else would clearly have to write even THAT for her. She may be likable only in the sense that she might one day stop injecting herself with fifteen-hundred different tranquilizers on a daily basis.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real positive thing that came out of this mess was the ending theme. Which, curiously enough, is in stark contrast to the content of the show. That is to say, it has a lot of flow and emotion to it. Whatever the story was aiming for at the end of each episode, \"RAINBOW\" by LEGO BIG MORL took that trash and turned it into something that might make you think you're actually getting emotionally invested in.\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nNot recommended. Unless you're in the mood to see nothing more than some boobs along with some silly sword action.",

            "content": "Bueno, muchachos another action josei pack anime has ended, so I'm not gonna fuck around, so with out any adieu, here are my ratings for each of this anime's category:\r\nGood 7.\r\nStory- I like the story where it revolves around an assassin who is trying to find her soul, now let's not forget that this anime's title \"Blade and Soul\" can be interpreted as an evil person who is trying to find redemption were it was more of a metaphor than a title, the plot may be good but not very good because the dramatic part didn't come along until the middle of part of theanime as a whole, also, there is that 13th episode which was more of a drag than anything else, but then again it can be ignored since the main climax was entertaining in the 12th episode. Also, I kinda like that the cast were josie that also gives this anime such uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nArt- I kinda like the way the character's were drawn, ok so it does have that moe thing on them but then again the way they were illustrated was a combination of hotness and elegant,  though, Alka's attire may have that fanservice that the pirreos would howl for it can be forgiven.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFair 6:\\n\\n\r\nSound- I don't have much to say as to the voices of the characters, in fact their voices do really match the roles that the character's portray, however, Alka, hummmm, I really do find it hard as to why she has to have this laconic woman whose action talk more that her words, though I like her, her being a woman with few words would be the reason why I have to give this category a 6.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Alka, like I've said is a woman with few words, now the thing about her was that this anime revolves around her and with Jin Varrel who happens to be another woman with few words. Though, I like the way they fight and how Alka tries to search her soul, there are times that she just goes in circles, Jin Varrell's role on the other hand pretty much depends on her bitch Yu Ran. As for the other characters like Hazuki was more of a filler for Alka's hardships, Loana was more like a drunkard bimbo big bitch and Elle Karen, oh yes her character.....was more of a mystery than anything else but she was also a disappointment because we were made to think that she's gonna gets some payback on Alka for killing her man, but has a change of heart in the end, such action prompted me to give this category a 6.\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- My enjoyment stems from the main character's quest to find her soul and that's all I have to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- It was one very good anime, not bad for taking it from a Korean MMORPG, I guess when it come to making good anime Jap's don't have the monopoly and it goes to show that even if it was taken from a Korean  MMORPG them Korean can make a good anime as well if they were given a chance.",

            "content": "Blade and Soul is the latest game that is based on an actual MMORPG and not about people trapped in one. It mostly follows Alka, a mysterious swordswoman who is being hunted by the same people who murdered her master.\r\nAs stated the story is essentially about how Alka is trying to find the person who killed her master while at the same time trying to stay alive. To make matters worse, Alka herself has a bounty on her and can be identified easily by a tattoo on her body, meaning everyone is out to get her. On her journey she meets both friends and foeas she tries to free both body and soul.\\n\\n\r\nThe story background, while standard, sounds decent as a journey of self discovery. It's very hard to talk about why this does not work in this anime without talking about the characters first.\\n\\n\r\nAlka herself has almost no personality at all. She is extremely reserved and rarely speaks. Near the end she gets some development because the story picks up for sake of finishing it and by then the viewer doesn't care. No connection has been made to Alka (or any of the characters) so when something happens to them it's hard to be interested.\\n\\n\r\nIt might be not as bad if Alka was the only character without a gleaming personality. The entire cast is bland and one dimensional. It might be said the main villain (Jin Varel) is essentially an evil version of Alka. Also, a couple of major character Karen, and Roana have the same issues Alka has in her development. It comes to late, done too fast, makes little sense, and no connection is made by the viewer to the character. To top it all off, there are reoccurring side-characters that seem to have no purpose at all but to take up time in an episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow we can get back to the story. For the first few episodes things are very loosely connected and Alka is simply getting put into a different situation where she has to solve a problem. In other words, it goes nowhere. However, later on the story takes over and huge changes in the characters take hold. It's almost like watching two different shows. On top of that in the latter half you wonder what the point of anything that happened in the first half was besides simply meeting the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we get to something good. The animation is really good and Alka herself is nice to look at. The sound is decent too. Overall the production values of the anime are fairly high. Also, anyone expecting a fan-service anime is going to be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime just had no balance. It had some decent fight scenes but almost all the attempts at comedy are tired. It doesn't really develop any characters and the couple times it does is ruined by pacing and placement. The show tries to get you to feel emotional but again, too early or too late. It's not even a good show for the sake of watching anime girls with large breasts. The game might be better than this.",

            "content": "Normally I don't bother with reviews, but the reviews I saw for Blade & Soul p**sed me off. They hardly do this anime justice, apparently Blade & Soul is based off a game, I've never played it and I don't intend to. This review isn't about the game but the anime and the anime was GOOD!\r\nStory (7/10): The general plot of the story is good, it's not to cliche. An assassin goes out for revenge against the person who killed her master. Stuff happens. Etc. Now I don't mean to spoil it or anything, but that's not the only plot for the anime. It beginswith her wanting revenge, but it ends up with her trying to find her own path.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): I LOVED the artwork! The fight scenes were done so well, boobs jiggled when they were supposed to, slow motion bullets ricocheting off stuff, sword swings, fire. It all looked beautiful. 'nough said.  \\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10): To be honest, I'm not a good judge for sound. The OP and ED weren't annoying to watch and were quite enjoyable. But when it comes to sound, I don't tend to pay attention... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): The characters were really well, you can see how their personalities grow with time and they never act out of character. They're just great. I had quite a few \"NOOOO!\" dramatic moments\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): The anime is actually quite enjoying. I was glued to my bed watching it, waiting to see what would happen next. I stared shocked, even whined about a few scenes because how they tore me up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10): Overall the anime is definitely worth a watch if you're into intense, serious animes with good fight scenes and character development.",

And then its turned into an unexcepted disaster. \r\nOverall it is hard to followand sometimes you wish just to stop the entire series. But the 3 end episodes saving this anime from breaking apart under its story. So I really hope it turns out good with the special ones. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Each anime has its own notable points. Bleach has music, Naruto has a good story, One Piece has the moronic fanbase and Blade&Soul has one of the  most memorable character developements ever. If you can't stand uselessly long analysis just read the first 2 paragraphs. \r\nBefore I start going into a very extensive review of the aforementioned lets throw down the basics. Blade&Soul originates from a chinese medieval fantasy MMORPG. The basic plot is that the Param empire has taken control of everything and groups rebel against their oppressors. That said the anime never clarifies if Param are actually bad guys. Or rather, itnever shows the rebels being the good guys. Both sides are corrupt, with drugs, whoring, thieving and murder being pretty common. Keep in mind that I haven't played the MMO so I'm not sure if things are relayed correctly, but the anime version left me a pretty good impression. Our protagonist is Alka, an emotionless (way more on that later) killing machine fighting the Param Empire to avenge the murder of her teacher that she was framed for. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical stuff the animation is stunning, in very high resolution and with very good combat depiction. The fights instead of being typical shounen fights (aka throw a punch, take 5 seconds to show the reactions and another 10 seconds to explain what you just did) are fast paced and with no more dialogue exchanges than needed. In fact people who talk during fights tend to die, pretty horribly at that. Also keep in mind that there's a lot of blood and considering the amounts of cleavage shown the anime easily gets a 13+ (by Japan's standards). The music on the other hand is forgettable and the voice acting fitting but nothing extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the show's highlight: Alka, the protagonist. When we first meet her, and in fact for the majority of the anime's episodes, Alka displays no emotion whatsoever. She is a cold calculating killing machine with no regrets for what she does and no purpose other than \"getting revenge\". \"Getting revenge\" might be Alka's own words for it but I have my doubts about that. Revenge as a feeling is something brought fourth from hatred and Alka is completely incapable of feeling anything, let alone a strong emotion like that. In the anime we will often see her get injured but she never gets angry at her attacker. She will of course fight to defend herself but she will display no signs of happiness upon her success. In other words it's not revenge that moves her. A sense of justice maybe? No, Alka has no morals or a code that she follows, I doubt she even understands the concept of justice to begin with. No, I believe the real reason Alka is trying to find the people who murdered her master is because she doesn't know what else to do with her life. (Spoilers) That is also proved by the fact that after she does get her \"revenge\" she shows no satisfaction, but just sits arounds until a friend tells her to follow her and she complies. Like a program, after she has completed her initial task she doesn't know what to do, so she just goes on standby waiting for someone else to input the next purpose of her life.\\n\\n\r\nAlka wasn't a person who became a killing machine, but rather the opposite. In the anime it is often mentioned that she is not exactly human to begin with but a monster, but I never understood if they were referring to her cold indifference to the mayhem around her, or a really monsterous background. But despite me naming her machine the viewer will propably see her in another way, especially after 2 or 3 episodes. I found myself considering Alka a child more often than not. Her appearance is definitely adult, no question about that, but unlike the rest of the equally gifted cast Alka just doesn't come out to the viewer as a woman but as a girl. It's not that she is stupid but rather that like a child she has yet to understand how emotions work. Throughout the series the viewer will experience two things. One, that he will start paying very close attention to Alka's behaviour, trying to find clues as to how the girl thinks through even the most mundane of things (like the way she walks in a city). At that point kudos to the animators for paying attention to little details like that. The second is that you will propably feel guilt for craving for the moments when Alka is under intense pain, because screams, widening of the eye etc etc are reactions you don't often see in  her apathetic face. (Either that or I'm sick in the head... I have no problem with that.)\\n\\n\r\nHeavy Spoilers: After Alka does get her revenge and she witnesses the death of another student of her master she does start feeling sadness, though the change is still subtle. And as she slowly acquires emotions Alka also comes to the realisation that \"killing is bad\". Still she manages to push that thought aside and maintain her expersionlessness until a busty-blonde tavern owner invites herto work at her tavern. Alka, having no other purpose at the moment immediatly complies and begins to work for the busty-blonde. Said busty-blonde had appeared numerous times before in the anime, continuously bumping unto Alka and saving her when she needed saving. You could say she was the show's Urahara. The busty Urahara (god, a terrible image just crossed my mind...) introduces Alka to another employee, also a former assassin. The employee immediatly empathises with Alka and tries to befriend her, which Alka greatly appreciates and finally lets herself become a bit more \"alive\".\\n\\n\r\nOne night the busty-blonde calls Alka to her private room, where she tells her a story about how she was in love once and her husband was brutally murdered by an assassin. The blonde shows an already-nervous Alka a portrait of her husband and Alka realises in horror that she was the one who had killed him. The blond suddenly appears way more cruel than the character we had been used to saving the day. She tells a fastly-panicking Alka that the reason she kept her alive was so that she could have her revenge. While Alka was emotionless she wasn't worth taking revenge on, so the bar owner kept helping Alka develop feelings (throughout the series the viewer had the impression that the proprietress was acting out of kindness, that's a big twist to the story). Alka goes trembling back to her room where she's met by the other former assassin. At this point keep in mind that the girl is experiencing fear and guilt for the first time. She has no idea how to react to them, and up till now hasn't even felt anything strongly positive that could balance out what she's going through. The employee finds Alka covering herself with the blanket and trembling (believe me, adorable scene) so she comforts her. The girl (and at this point she's definitely a \"girl\" and not a \"woman\") is immediatly calmed by the presense of a friend and actually begs the employee not to leave (she wanted to make some tea to help calm down Alka). The employee leaves anyway promising to be back soon. As time passes the girl starts looking for her and finds her dead outside the building. The blonde is standing on the sideways and whispers to Alka that all murderers will eventually get what's coming to them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so we arrive to my favourite part of the anime. \"Mental Breakdown\" What's really wonderful about this is that it doesn't last 5 minutes like the typical emo phase most shounen protagonists go through, but rather the rest of the series! After running away (and I do mean running) from the tavern Alka keeps realising just how many people she has killed and for the first time in her life is afraid of death herself. The shock of seeing herself murdered doesn't make things better and she considers herself responsible for it (which she kinda is). Alka keeps moving... No, the girl keeps \"running\" from place to place, struggling to escape her guilt and her increasing fear. At some point she even hallucinates from the terror. Let it be clear to the reader that this is a HUGE difference from before. Whereas Alka was a fearless killing machine at the start she is now a crying girl trembling. As the girl keeps moving from place to place she keeps finding graveyards mostly filled by her and her despair keeps mounting. This also starts to affect her combat skills. Alka, apart from being dead-tired due to lack of sleep and taking care of herself, keeps freezing in the middle of the fight. It is never explained why but I assume that it is either the thought that she fills more graves or the fear that she may actually die, or a combination of both, earning her more wounds and terryfing her further in a loop. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, half-crazed and completely weakened the girl runs to a snow forest, trying to get away from civilization and her victims' graves. She stays for a while (in a semi-insane state, now almost completely unable to use her weapons and way too wounded) in the house of an elder couple who welcome her as if she was their child (the father does seem enraged at her at times). At some point she realises that she had killed their daughter and tries to escape panicked. This is a great scene because it shows to her that practically \"there is no escape\" from her sins, which she realises all too well. The husband tries to shoot Alka but instead misses and kills his wife. Alka freezes in place watching (these were the people that had saved her from certain death and welcomed her to their home). The husband (looking at the girl) puts the shotgun in his mouth and shoots, leaving the girl with the corpses of the people who had taken care of her in the middle of a cold snowfield.\\n\\n\r\nNow the anime does bring fourth a question repeatedly that is basically the axis around which the anime moves. \"When is it right to kill someone?\" It is never clarified if Alka was on the wrong when she was working as an assassin. Certainly she caused a lot of pain and propably left a lot of women widows, a lot of children orphaned. But it was her job and many of the people she killed were truly corrupt. In the end Alka doesn't find the solution either, but just kinda skips over the part.\\n\\n\r\nEpilogue:\\n\r\nI love the series. Not because of the combat, the animation, of how gifted all the females are, the depiction of corruption or even the plot twists, but because of  huge the change of our protagonist is, from a machine with no human emotions to a broken girl with no hope. That said I do have some complaints: One the most notable male cast member is the ape of the Param, whose name I can't even remember. Two: There are no flat girls, as a class A lolicon I cannot accept that. Three: The ending. Unfortunately they had to ruin it, and instead of ending the anime with a broken Alka the girl is saved by the busty-blonde (who found revenge bitter after all)  in the last half of the final episode. Honestly I could do without that. Fourth: You never understand the story of the villain, or tha nature of the evil magic Param uses. Yeah I get that she's a tortured soul like Alka but... Who the f$\"\u00a3 is she? Anyway, ignoring those (and they can be pretty easily ignored) I definitely suggest watching this if you're a fan of action or if you're looking for some food for thought.",

            "content": "Contains spoilers, but still you should read as I'm telling you why you shouldn't watch this anime.\r\nI'm writing this review just to warn people who come to watch this anime because of their interest in the game, like myself.\r\nBeware, this anime is super bad, in every way, when it shows some good points, it's only let down by something else, nothing good comes from watching this anime, you'll lose interest after the second episode, and half way though you'll be forcing yourself to continue just for the sake of completion. Let me explain why this anime is so horrific:\r\n1. The story... The story has somerelations to the game, which is obviously expected, but it just doesn't have any punch to it, it's so bland, it hardly makes sense, there is no background story, no history. Sure, you know why Alka (the main character) is after Jin Varel, for revenge, but it's pathetic, it just follows Alka's path of vengeance and there is no plot what so ever here. It takes a twist towards the end of the anime, after Alka supposedly kills Jin Varel, but she comes back to life, but you don't even know she is coming back to life until she is actually up and walking and hunting down Alka again. And by the way, you never do find out why Jin Varel killed Master Hon (Alka's reason for taking revenge). Atrocious.\\n\\n\r\n2. The art... The art could have been the one good point of this anime, and actually not being so bad, it was let down by the poor syncing and the dreadful animation. There were times where the characters were talking in animation, but actually no sound coming from them, no voice over, they were just mouthing or something? I doubt that was intended, it happened multiple times and it was so frustrating to see, it was cheap. There was another time, where a character was just walking on the spot, doing the same animation over and over, while they were talking over the top, like a game that had froze. So despite the art not being too bad on the eye, it was let down dramatically until the point where it was frustrating to watch.\\n\\n\r\n3. The sound... Over dramatic breathing, makes you think you're watching hentai, and have to turn the volume down and be on the edge of your seat constantly listening out for your parents. At least the closing song was good (in my opinion).\\n\\n\r\n4. The characters... Oh my gosh, where to even get started, the characters were so BORING. They had nothing about them, no history, or very vague history at most. There was no explanation as to how Jin Varel came impure, and how Alka was born into the clan of the sword. The main character Alka, hardly said a word, it was watching her static face and hearing her over dramatic breathing as things happened around her, she is utterly the most boring main character I have ever came across. The proprietress shows potential, however nothing comes of it, you don't really learn much about her, other than the fact that Alka killed her man in the past, you don't know how she developed her fighting skills, or how she became the proprietress, and that can be said for every other single character in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n5. The enjoyment... Huh? There is none. I was bored throughout, despite one scene which looked like the producers put all their time and effort into, a battle between Alka and Jin Varel, and it still wasn't even that good to be fair.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're coming to watch this anime, because you play the game, you'll find some relations, but you won't learn anything about the game, and you certainly won't enjoy watching the anime. And that's my review, it turned into more of a rant, but how can that be helped, watch and you'll see. But please save your life and watch something more interesting.\\n\\n",

The characters were well thought out and interesting. The visuals were a treat to look at. It delivered what it offered and I\u2019m glad I watched it. But I do have one complaint I wish to address to pad this review. The character of Hazuki is poor designed and overused to virtually no effect. I feel the show could\u2019ve done without her. Some may dislike this show because of all the T & A and that\u2019sfine. Personally I felt the story and action were engaging enough to ignore the fan service and just  enjoy the show.",

            "content": "Story & Characters: \r\nBlade & Soul tells the story of Alka, an emotionless assassin, who seeks to avenge her murdered Master. Killing and death is very much in the focus in Blade & Soul but it succeeds in showing what a double-edged sword killing truly is. Blade & Soul shows a nice character progress, being relatively short 1-cour series does show through as sometimes the development is slightly too sudden. In the end Blade & Soul is a story of Alka growing up and becoming more aware of the world that surrounds her, it truly is filled with likeable characters and I surprisingly didn't findoverly annoying characters in this show. What did bother me was the fact that not all characters past could be told and were left untold, again likely due to the fact that it is only 1-cour series but they did very well regardless. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: \\n\r\nThe art and animation in Blade & Soul was good and the fights were smoothly done and action packed. The characters were beautifully made (although all very heavy in the boob department) and the show was overall very pleasing visually. The music wasn't really anything astonishing and I wasn't particularly impressed with either the opening nor the ending music. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: \\n\r\nIn the end I did enjoy Blade & Soul although it did have minor problems which were caused by the fact that this IS indeed an anime based on a game. There were some things left unexplained which bothered me a bit (and the game isn't avaible in English either so fuck you NCSoft for leaving me in the cold). You would usually think that after getting 7/9/7/8/8, you'd get 8 for overall but this isn't the case here. The character development and art was very good and overall I did enjoy the show very much but the story just lacks enough punch to bump this anime to an 8 and it does show through at the end of the anime. But that being said Blade & Soul is much better than what you'd expect out of a game adaptation and is definately worth watching if you're into action and appreciate the good art in anime.",

It has a lot of diferent powers and characters really interesting and you are waiting to know more about them and.... you will be waiting for it all the anime long. There\u00b4s no explanation that reveal the true of the story Thinks happend when they must and thats all. I still wondering why its named Blade and Soul. they only talk about soul in some moments that try to be intense and oving but they end up being crap. So they fucked upwith the argument.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nthis anime seems to have some elements computered-animated, personally i dont dislike them, but excetp the main characters, the rest of the characters and the enviroment don\u00b4t have a good animation in my opini\u00f3n. The other big problem with this anime are transitions, the studio thaat made this anime hasnt heard about them, putting the picture on black and turnning off the music isnt the right way to change scenes.( I left fanservice behind) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 2\\n\r\nI think thats the most important part of an anime, a good soundtrack can make you be glue to the screen and this anime dont have it. It has a pretty high number of songs and the opening isn\u00b4t so bad, but the rest of the music is completely generic, it transmit nothing, don\u00b4t matter if alka is fighting or about to die.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nThey are all females, OK. They all have big \"OPPAIS\", OK. The problem is that the have no history behind them, except alka that you will see some flashbacks about her life, almost the rest of the characters don\u00b4t have a past, purpose or a goal, they are part of the anime because the studio cound\u00b4t do an anime only with a character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nIf u have nothing to see, or you want to see it while your doing another thing its okey. You won\u00b4t probably like it, but it will entertain you. The lastest episoies improve a little bit, and the last one, which is different form the rest, its the best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3",

And that wasn't for revenge, at least, due to her lack of emotions, it seemed that way to me. \r\nBut during the course of the story, her evolve at aslow but extremely well built pace. The other characters also had great development, Karen in particular.\\n\r\nBut, it all culminates on the end, when someone ask her what she was doing and Aruka answered \"living\".\\n\\n\r\nThe story could be seen as an unique genre of it's own. Almost like a Action Fantasy slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nI'll say again.

            "content": "*only really minor spoilers here\r\nWatching the first 8 episodes of Blade and Soul feels like you're just watching another fantasy medival anime, albeit a very bad one. The story feels rather rushed and is vaguely explained, the characters are flat, and lack any meaningful depth or connection to them. \r\nWhat got me through this anime for those episodes was the somewhat decent animation, and a little hope that the anime would improve itself. It eventually did, with the second half delivering more emotion, character development, and brings and interesting twist to the story. It eventually reverted back to being your typical hero vs Big badguy towards the end, but the main character motives are better understood and the ending was conclusive. It still left a lot of questions unanswered and quite a bit of flat characters though. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I didn't particularly like was the way the anime tries to develop their characters and progress the story by introducing new characters every episode, only to kill them later on in the SAME EPISODE. This is somewhat similar to what Akame ga Kill did, showing the side characters backstory in one episode and killing them in that same episode. This may work with a lot of people (and in AGK it did), but for me it just won't do.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about things that are mixed, there is also the animation. Sometimes the fight scene can make you go wow with some stunning shots and cheography, but most of the time it is just average. Animation consistency is decent with the some strange inconsistencies (mainly one of the final episodes, they were just probably saving budget to animate the following episode, which has a big fight scene). Women character designs are good though, if a not on a little bit of the fanservices side. They look good and stand out, but you kinda feel a little bit jarring when almost any woman in the anime has big breasts and huge asses. \\n\\n\r\nHave you guessed why I wrote \"women character designs\" instead of \"Character designs\" yet? Because the character designs for the male characters in this anime are nonexistent. They either be extremely ugly, or extremely generic if you are being generous. This probably won't pose a problem to the viewers, because 95% of the main chracters are females anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM used in the anime is rather standard, but I was pleasantly surprised by the ending, \"RAINBOW\" by LEGO BIG MORL. Not only the ending music is good, but the animation accompanied by it was simply amazing, even if it is CGI. The opening is trash though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Blade and Soul is not good, nor bad. It didn't do anything well, but that doesn't mean it did a bad job either. Other than the twist after the first 8 episodes, and the simply top notch ending, There is nothing that is particularly good or new that can be had in this anime. \\n\r\nI definitely had some fun while watching this anime, but would I recommend it to anyone though? Probably not. There are animes that are more worthy of your time than Blade and Soul.\\n\\n\r\nSo, as a summary,\\n\r\nWatch if you want:\\n\r\n- fanservice, characters with big boobs\\n\r\n- somewhat intersting fight scenes, battles\\n\r\nDon't watch it if you want: \\n\r\n- a decent story\\n\r\n- memorable characters\\n\r\n- beautiful animations (art is rather debatable though)\\n\\n\r\nScores:\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nArt, animation: 6/10\\n\r\nmusic: 7/10 (just for that godly ED)\\n\r\ncharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nenjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 6/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Based off a Korean MMORPG game produced by NC Soft, there\u2019s a truckload of problems I find that didn\u2019t do well when adapting such a genre. But really, Blade & Soul isn\u2019t anything special especially when the main characters are generic to the core. It\u2019s soulless per se.\r\nFor starters, we get a fantasy setting with beautiful landscapes and the feeling that you\u2019re actually in a fictional world. That\u2019sthe initial impression the show first makes but it quickly loses its praise when we are introduced to its cast of characters \u2013 beautiful women wearing skimpy outfits. One such character is named Alka, with a very cold personality and a thirst for vengeance. From the beginning, we find out that she\u2019s on a quest, to deliver vengeance as a way of revenge as result of someone that killed her master. Although the premise sounds promising, it derides itself with its setup when most of Alka\u2019s persona is setup as solely being a warrior. As the titular character, she wields a dangerous blade along with a tattoo for a gimmick. And if that wasn\u2019t clich\u00e9 enough, she is hunted down as a bounty that countries has set up to claim her head on a plate.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, Alka suffers not just from characterization but also value, a sense that makes people underappreciate what she is doing. In the beginning, she is chased by some soldiers with guns (yes, guns in a series when blades are a prominent feature). But of course, she is able to avoid death with superhuman feats. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, it all happens far too fast and makes the audience wonder what this purpose is. Really, a girl with a soulless personality wielding a blade and on a quest for vengeance should deliver more than just showing off her moves. The only hint we do get is some of the flashbacks we see between Alka and her master. Unfortunately, it feels subtle and lacking compassion because we don\u2019t feel attached to their relationship. And speaking of relationships, Alka is on a sinking ship when it comes to forming one with any character. Literally, almost every character she meets during her quest dies. In retrospect, she is walking death flag that triggers your fate of doom.\\n\\n\r\nAs refined as the premise may be, the show feels less more of an adventure or quest but more like a cat and mouse game. From the first episode, it\u2019s clear that many people want Alka\u2019s head on a plate. Although she hunts Jin Varel (her master\u2019s murderer), Alka becomes the hunted nearly every episode with pursuers. For a girl with such a cold personality, she doesn\u2019t hesitate to defend herself and draws out meaningless fights. The action itself feels lifeless and solely seems to function as a way to show that Alka needs to survive in order to carry out her revenge. In short, Alka is a character that is hard to get attached to or sympathize about. In fact, many people in this show suffered more than she has so why does she get any more special acclaim?\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast members doesn\u2019t do much well with their characterization either. For instance, there\u2019s Dan Roana who serves as the leader of the Pleasure Gang, a group that opposes the Palam Empire. While their motivations are different, its goal is the same as Alka; to carry out revenge for what they did in the past. Clich\u00e9 as it sounds, the show also neglects any development as the premise of revenge is delivered with a lack of emotional attachment. Similarly, most characters seems to have mental breakdowns or suffered some sort of grim past. The key failure here is not just a lack of attachment the audience will feel distanced from but their characterization. Almost nothing is explained by some of the characters\u2019 motivations and their stale influence towards Alka\u2019s adventures is hardly memorable. Similarly, antagonists are generic with stereotypical inspirations and in general, a lack of focus in their persona. On the other hand, there\u2019s some character development but not on Alka. Instead, they only come and then soon goes away like the wind as characters are killed by this show\u2019s shenanigans. \\n\\n\r\nAs an adventurous series, the story is also plagued with weak direction and senseless action. There\u2019s little purpose to what most of the characters do throughout each episode. For delivering a series about survival and revenge, there\u2019s a lackluster development in any sense for Alka. It genuinely dismiss any sort of change with her character because her soulless personality. Even when the show tries to deliver some charisma such as Jin Hazuki\u2019s bounty hunting ways, it ultimately fails to achieve its general purpose. It\u2019s just the basic face value of the hunter and the hunted. Only the strongest survive and the weak perish. It\u2019s generic and lacks melancholy from a series that could be potentially thought tearing. You won\u2019t be shedding tears during Alka\u2019s quest of revenge but rather confusion and despair, the action of shaking your head and wonder where this all goes to in the end. And speaking of endings, the show functions like a time bomb that explodes with destructive results, almost laughable by the conclusive episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe only hopes saving this show is its world concept and civilization. Its landscapes are beautiful and the world this show takes place in has a diverse population, especially in terms of races. Unfortunately, none of that really becomes a focus because the majority of the show focuses on Alka and her adventure. With a lack of world building and character dynamics, the only other noticeable feature I can say for this show would be the action. Because it adapts a serious tone with minimal comedy, the action can be a hit and miss. On some scenarios, it is honest with integrity and well-coordinated movements. The way Alka fights proves credibility of her worth and the violence itself is explicitly true to this show\u2019s grim atmosphere. Otherwise, it can feel forceful and devoid of attractiveness when it feels repetitive. Some action scenes are also motivated by a lack of focus in its writing and to be honest, this show just fails to deliver its intentions. Hey, it even tries to do that with some terminology overview at the end of each episode. The key word here is \u2018try\u2019 because for whatever reason, they are usually left out from the main story. Shrug.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fantasy series, the production studio Gonzo focuses primarily on bringing this show\u2019s world to life. And based on visuals, it does live up to its promise when it comes to artistic values and artwork. The world is decorated with thought provoking imagery and beautiful landscapes. Many of its structures also brings the feel of a fantasy to home. Character designs are also flamboyant and crafted to fit with the show\u2019s premise.  On the other hand, fan service is present throughout every episode whether it\u2019s the camera angles, revealing outfits, or female character designs that makes them look more voluptuous than they should be. Oh and violence always become a centerpiece at every angle in the show so expect blood pouring like rice.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is hardly noticeable and the only time they seem to hold any promise is during action scenes when climatic events happen. The OST just seems to fade in the background with little emotional value because the way direction characters are drawn out. The cries and agony of despair can only be sympathized when we feel attached to the characters so most of their portrayals feels hollow. The scream of pain and despair feels empty with thoughtlessness. For Alka, her voice is hardly memorable as nearly every conversation she has with others feels monotonous and lacks feeling. The only credit I can give to the soundtrack would be the ED song for its symbolism, style (with the decorative dancing), and catchy tone. Otherwise, it\u2019s nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nBlade & Soul is a disappointment and a show that you should not come in with high expectations. What you get is an emotionless girl that I doubt anyone will feel attached to. Her quest feels hollow with little value besides to deliver her vengeance. Mindless entertainment is what you get from this show\u2019s fragile story and incoherent developments. Forget the majority of the characters because none of them really stands out for more than an episode besides Alka. And while technical visual aspects saves the show from total destruction, it\u2019s still hard to salvage from its own delivery. Such a shame too with a beautiful fantasy world at hand but everything that ultimately delivered is just a big ball of broken gadgets. Be aware.\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER WARNING**\r\nAt first, this series seemed to be extremely intriguing. I liked the premise of the story, and the art/animation style is gorgeous. But unfortunately, for a majority of the series, that's the only thing that I could say positive.\r\nAlka is an assassin for the Clan of the Sword. She's on a journey to find Jin Varrel, who killed her master Hon. Jin is a demon-like woman who controls the Energy of Chaos and kills without feeling, which is similar to how Alka has learned to kill in her work as an assassin. On her journey, Alka meets three gorgeous, strange women, each a greatwarrior in her own right and grapples with her slain master's wish that she leave the life of an assassin behind.\\n\\n\r\nSounds promising right? This series has great potential. But, it develops far too slowly for me. The action, when it does show, is very exciting. But does not occur frequently enough. Like most series, there are flashbacks and back stories that are needed to be shown. Unfortunately, I feel as if it took way too much time, and deviated from the primary plot too often.\\n\\n\r\nI feel as if the series relied too often on the bombshell beauties' looks to maintain the viewers attention. Yes, the female characters are gorgeous. But that can only take a series so far. That being said, the animation style used is outstanding. I thought the colors used really conveyed to the mood of each situation/episode. Same could be said of the music.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a wonderfully animated series with some great characters. Some great action. But far too much emphasis on the gorgeous (big breasted) characters looks.The series was very slow to develop, and was boring at times.",

            "content": "Perhaps a thing of note is that Blade and Soul does not look nor feel like a video game (as one might have expected), just your standard fantasy fare with the magics, totally not loli/shota/furries and stuffs. Blade and Soul is essentially another Queen's Blade... You know, as in, lots of sword wielding thots and... stuffs. Though, it's nowhere near as sexually rampant as Queen's Blade. Instead, in it's place, Blade and Soul can manage to be more retarded. Whatever semblance of an actual story there may have been has surely been bastardized; but to what extent has it been butchered I wouldn't know. Andit seems like I will never know for certain either since NCsoft will never make an English release of the damn game. In any case, what we have here are heavy handed conflict and resolutions, and a plethora of awkward brief as well as irrelevant flashbacks (except perhaps the flashbacks we see between Alka and her master) that happen for something the show is entirely alien to. A thing called \"emotion\".\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not to say that Blade and Soul is particularly painful to watch. No, you'll be able to marathon this with relative ease. You will at least not feel like your mind is being relentlessly cut to tiny pieces by an utterly shat-upon pacing and heaps and mountains of contrivances. It still pretty much has every other problem that typically plagues a video-game anime-adaption, though. \\n\\n\r\nWhich now brings us to the characters. One loli, three or four shotas, a wannabee cutesy stubborn drunk girl who suddenly turns to psycho bitch and back, a lady bar owner whose not afraid to get her hands dirty and is supposed to play the wise old hag yet is nothing of the sort.... Ugh, why am I even trying? One of the bad guys is a muscle bound oaf that does nothing but grunt! Everyone here changes whatever semblance of a personality they have as the plot demands it, particularly in the case of the obnoxious drunk girl and bar owner to jarring effect. And especially in the case with our dear lead Alka, she plays the role of the done-to-death assassin. One whose apparently supposed to be cool precisely because she's humorless and cold to the point where she might as well be holding a giant poster sign saying, \"Please ask me the following question: 'are you even human?', thanks!\". Only in her case, someone else would clearly have to write even THAT for her. She may be likable only in the sense that she might one day stop injecting herself with fifteen-hundred different tranquilizers on a daily basis.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real positive thing that came out of this mess was the ending theme. Which, curiously enough, is in stark contrast to the content of the show. That is to say, it has a lot of flow and emotion to it. Whatever the story was aiming for at the end of each episode, \"RAINBOW\" by LEGO BIG MORL took that trash and turned it into something that might make you think you're actually getting emotionally invested in.\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nNot recommended. Unless you're in the mood to see nothing more than some boobs along with some silly sword action.",

            "content": "Bueno, muchachos another action josei pack anime has ended, so I'm not gonna fuck around, so with out any adieu, here are my ratings for each of this anime's category:\r\nGood 7.\r\nStory- I like the story where it revolves around an assassin who is trying to find her soul, now let's not forget that this anime's title \"Blade and Soul\" can be interpreted as an evil person who is trying to find redemption were it was more of a metaphor than a title, the plot may be good but not very good because the dramatic part didn't come along until the middle of part of theanime as a whole, also, there is that 13th episode which was more of a drag than anything else, but then again it can be ignored since the main climax was entertaining in the 12th episode. Also, I kinda like that the cast were josie that also gives this anime such uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nArt- I kinda like the way the character's were drawn, ok so it does have that moe thing on them but then again the way they were illustrated was a combination of hotness and elegant,  though, Alka's attire may have that fanservice that the pirreos would howl for it can be forgiven.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFair 6:\\n\\n\r\nSound- I don't have much to say as to the voices of the characters, in fact their voices do really match the roles that the character's portray, however, Alka, hummmm, I really do find it hard as to why she has to have this laconic woman whose action talk more that her words, though I like her, her being a woman with few words would be the reason why I have to give this category a 6.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Alka, like I've said is a woman with few words, now the thing about her was that this anime revolves around her and with Jin Varrel who happens to be another woman with few words. Though, I like the way they fight and how Alka tries to search her soul, there are times that she just goes in circles, Jin Varrell's role on the other hand pretty much depends on her bitch Yu Ran. As for the other characters like Hazuki was more of a filler for Alka's hardships, Loana was more like a drunkard bimbo big bitch and Elle Karen, oh yes her character.....was more of a mystery than anything else but she was also a disappointment because we were made to think that she's gonna gets some payback on Alka for killing her man, but has a change of heart in the end, such action prompted me to give this category a 6.\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- My enjoyment stems from the main character's quest to find her soul and that's all I have to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- It was one very good anime, not bad for taking it from a Korean MMORPG, I guess when it come to making good anime Jap's don't have the monopoly and it goes to show that even if it was taken from a Korean  MMORPG them Korean can make a good anime as well if they were given a chance.",

            "content": "Blade and Soul is the latest game that is based on an actual MMORPG and not about people trapped in one. It mostly follows Alka, a mysterious swordswoman who is being hunted by the same people who murdered her master.\r\nAs stated the story is essentially about how Alka is trying to find the person who killed her master while at the same time trying to stay alive. To make matters worse, Alka herself has a bounty on her and can be identified easily by a tattoo on her body, meaning everyone is out to get her. On her journey she meets both friends and foeas she tries to free both body and soul.\\n\\n\r\nThe story background, while standard, sounds decent as a journey of self discovery. It's very hard to talk about why this does not work in this anime without talking about the characters first.\\n\\n\r\nAlka herself has almost no personality at all. She is extremely reserved and rarely speaks. Near the end she gets some development because the story picks up for sake of finishing it and by then the viewer doesn't care. No connection has been made to Alka (or any of the characters) so when something happens to them it's hard to be interested.\\n\\n\r\nIt might be not as bad if Alka was the only character without a gleaming personality. The entire cast is bland and one dimensional. It might be said the main villain (Jin Varel) is essentially an evil version of Alka. Also, a couple of major character Karen, and Roana have the same issues Alka has in her development. It comes to late, done too fast, makes little sense, and no connection is made by the viewer to the character. To top it all off, there are reoccurring side-characters that seem to have no purpose at all but to take up time in an episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow we can get back to the story. For the first few episodes things are very loosely connected and Alka is simply getting put into a different situation where she has to solve a problem. In other words, it goes nowhere. However, later on the story takes over and huge changes in the characters take hold. It's almost like watching two different shows. On top of that in the latter half you wonder what the point of anything that happened in the first half was besides simply meeting the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we get to something good. The animation is really good and Alka herself is nice to look at. The sound is decent too. Overall the production values of the anime are fairly high. Also, anyone expecting a fan-service anime is going to be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime just had no balance. It had some decent fight scenes but almost all the attempts at comedy are tired. It doesn't really develop any characters and the couple times it does is ruined by pacing and placement. The show tries to get you to feel emotional but again, too early or too late. It's not even a good show for the sake of watching anime girls with large breasts. The game might be better than this.",

            "content": "Normally I don't bother with reviews, but the reviews I saw for Blade & Soul p**sed me off. They hardly do this anime justice, apparently Blade & Soul is based off a game, I've never played it and I don't intend to. This review isn't about the game but the anime and the anime was GOOD!\r\nStory (7/10): The general plot of the story is good, it's not to cliche. An assassin goes out for revenge against the person who killed her master. Stuff happens. Etc. Now I don't mean to spoil it or anything, but that's not the only plot for the anime. It beginswith her wanting revenge, but it ends up with her trying to find her own path.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): I LOVED the artwork! The fight scenes were done so well, boobs jiggled when they were supposed to, slow motion bullets ricocheting off stuff, sword swings, fire. It all looked beautiful. 'nough said.  \\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10): To be honest, I'm not a good judge for sound. The OP and ED weren't annoying to watch and were quite enjoyable. But when it comes to sound, I don't tend to pay attention... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): The characters were really well, you can see how their personalities grow with time and they never act out of character. They're just great. I had quite a few \"NOOOO!\" dramatic moments\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): The anime is actually quite enjoying. I was glued to my bed watching it, waiting to see what would happen next. I stared shocked, even whined about a few scenes because how they tore me up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10): Overall the anime is definitely worth a watch if you're into intense, serious animes with good fight scenes and character development.",

And then its turned into an unexcepted disaster. \r\nOverall it is hard to followand sometimes you wish just to stop the entire series. But the 3 end episodes saving this anime from breaking apart under its story. So I really hope it turns out good with the special ones. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Each anime has its own notable points. Bleach has music, Naruto has a good story, One Piece has the moronic fanbase and Blade&Soul has one of the  most memorable character developements ever. If you can't stand uselessly long analysis just read the first 2 paragraphs. \r\nBefore I start going into a very extensive review of the aforementioned lets throw down the basics. Blade&Soul originates from a chinese medieval fantasy MMORPG. The basic plot is that the Param empire has taken control of everything and groups rebel against their oppressors. That said the anime never clarifies if Param are actually bad guys. Or rather, itnever shows the rebels being the good guys. Both sides are corrupt, with drugs, whoring, thieving and murder being pretty common. Keep in mind that I haven't played the MMO so I'm not sure if things are relayed correctly, but the anime version left me a pretty good impression. Our protagonist is Alka, an emotionless (way more on that later) killing machine fighting the Param Empire to avenge the murder of her teacher that she was framed for. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical stuff the animation is stunning, in very high resolution and with very good combat depiction. The fights instead of being typical shounen fights (aka throw a punch, take 5 seconds to show the reactions and another 10 seconds to explain what you just did) are fast paced and with no more dialogue exchanges than needed. In fact people who talk during fights tend to die, pretty horribly at that. Also keep in mind that there's a lot of blood and considering the amounts of cleavage shown the anime easily gets a 13+ (by Japan's standards). The music on the other hand is forgettable and the voice acting fitting but nothing extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the show's highlight: Alka, the protagonist. When we first meet her, and in fact for the majority of the anime's episodes, Alka displays no emotion whatsoever. She is a cold calculating killing machine with no regrets for what she does and no purpose other than \"getting revenge\". \"Getting revenge\" might be Alka's own words for it but I have my doubts about that. Revenge as a feeling is something brought fourth from hatred and Alka is completely incapable of feeling anything, let alone a strong emotion like that. In the anime we will often see her get injured but she never gets angry at her attacker. She will of course fight to defend herself but she will display no signs of happiness upon her success. In other words it's not revenge that moves her. A sense of justice maybe? No, Alka has no morals or a code that she follows, I doubt she even understands the concept of justice to begin with. No, I believe the real reason Alka is trying to find the people who murdered her master is because she doesn't know what else to do with her life. (Spoilers) That is also proved by the fact that after she does get her \"revenge\" she shows no satisfaction, but just sits arounds until a friend tells her to follow her and she complies. Like a program, after she has completed her initial task she doesn't know what to do, so she just goes on standby waiting for someone else to input the next purpose of her life.\\n\\n\r\nAlka wasn't a person who became a killing machine, but rather the opposite. In the anime it is often mentioned that she is not exactly human to begin with but a monster, but I never understood if they were referring to her cold indifference to the mayhem around her, or a really monsterous background. But despite me naming her machine the viewer will propably see her in another way, especially after 2 or 3 episodes. I found myself considering Alka a child more often than not. Her appearance is definitely adult, no question about that, but unlike the rest of the equally gifted cast Alka just doesn't come out to the viewer as a woman but as a girl. It's not that she is stupid but rather that like a child she has yet to understand how emotions work. Throughout the series the viewer will experience two things. One, that he will start paying very close attention to Alka's behaviour, trying to find clues as to how the girl thinks through even the most mundane of things (like the way she walks in a city). At that point kudos to the animators for paying attention to little details like that. The second is that you will propably feel guilt for craving for the moments when Alka is under intense pain, because screams, widening of the eye etc etc are reactions you don't often see in  her apathetic face. (Either that or I'm sick in the head... I have no problem with that.)\\n\\n\r\nHeavy Spoilers: After Alka does get her revenge and she witnesses the death of another student of her master she does start feeling sadness, though the change is still subtle. And as she slowly acquires emotions Alka also comes to the realisation that \"killing is bad\". Still she manages to push that thought aside and maintain her expersionlessness until a busty-blonde tavern owner invites herto work at her tavern. Alka, having no other purpose at the moment immediatly complies and begins to work for the busty-blonde. Said busty-blonde had appeared numerous times before in the anime, continuously bumping unto Alka and saving her when she needed saving. You could say she was the show's Urahara. The busty Urahara (god, a terrible image just crossed my mind...) introduces Alka to another employee, also a former assassin. The employee immediatly empathises with Alka and tries to befriend her, which Alka greatly appreciates and finally lets herself become a bit more \"alive\".\\n\\n\r\nOne night the busty-blonde calls Alka to her private room, where she tells her a story about how she was in love once and her husband was brutally murdered by an assassin. The blonde shows an already-nervous Alka a portrait of her husband and Alka realises in horror that she was the one who had killed him. The blond suddenly appears way more cruel than the character we had been used to saving the day. She tells a fastly-panicking Alka that the reason she kept her alive was so that she could have her revenge. While Alka was emotionless she wasn't worth taking revenge on, so the bar owner kept helping Alka develop feelings (throughout the series the viewer had the impression that the proprietress was acting out of kindness, that's a big twist to the story). Alka goes trembling back to her room where she's met by the other former assassin. At this point keep in mind that the girl is experiencing fear and guilt for the first time. She has no idea how to react to them, and up till now hasn't even felt anything strongly positive that could balance out what she's going through. The employee finds Alka covering herself with the blanket and trembling (believe me, adorable scene) so she comforts her. The girl (and at this point she's definitely a \"girl\" and not a \"woman\") is immediatly calmed by the presense of a friend and actually begs the employee not to leave (she wanted to make some tea to help calm down Alka). The employee leaves anyway promising to be back soon. As time passes the girl starts looking for her and finds her dead outside the building. The blonde is standing on the sideways and whispers to Alka that all murderers will eventually get what's coming to them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so we arrive to my favourite part of the anime. \"Mental Breakdown\" What's really wonderful about this is that it doesn't last 5 minutes like the typical emo phase most shounen protagonists go through, but rather the rest of the series! After running away (and I do mean running) from the tavern Alka keeps realising just how many people she has killed and for the first time in her life is afraid of death herself. The shock of seeing herself murdered doesn't make things better and she considers herself responsible for it (which she kinda is). Alka keeps moving... No, the girl keeps \"running\" from place to place, struggling to escape her guilt and her increasing fear. At some point she even hallucinates from the terror. Let it be clear to the reader that this is a HUGE difference from before. Whereas Alka was a fearless killing machine at the start she is now a crying girl trembling. As the girl keeps moving from place to place she keeps finding graveyards mostly filled by her and her despair keeps mounting. This also starts to affect her combat skills. Alka, apart from being dead-tired due to lack of sleep and taking care of herself, keeps freezing in the middle of the fight. It is never explained why but I assume that it is either the thought that she fills more graves or the fear that she may actually die, or a combination of both, earning her more wounds and terryfing her further in a loop. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, half-crazed and completely weakened the girl runs to a snow forest, trying to get away from civilization and her victims' graves. She stays for a while (in a semi-insane state, now almost completely unable to use her weapons and way too wounded) in the house of an elder couple who welcome her as if she was their child (the father does seem enraged at her at times). At some point she realises that she had killed their daughter and tries to escape panicked. This is a great scene because it shows to her that practically \"there is no escape\" from her sins, which she realises all too well. The husband tries to shoot Alka but instead misses and kills his wife. Alka freezes in place watching (these were the people that had saved her from certain death and welcomed her to their home). The husband (looking at the girl) puts the shotgun in his mouth and shoots, leaving the girl with the corpses of the people who had taken care of her in the middle of a cold snowfield.\\n\\n\r\nNow the anime does bring fourth a question repeatedly that is basically the axis around which the anime moves. \"When is it right to kill someone?\" It is never clarified if Alka was on the wrong when she was working as an assassin. Certainly she caused a lot of pain and propably left a lot of women widows, a lot of children orphaned. But it was her job and many of the people she killed were truly corrupt. In the end Alka doesn't find the solution either, but just kinda skips over the part.\\n\\n\r\nEpilogue:\\n\r\nI love the series. Not because of the combat, the animation, of how gifted all the females are, the depiction of corruption or even the plot twists, but because of  huge the change of our protagonist is, from a machine with no human emotions to a broken girl with no hope. That said I do have some complaints: One the most notable male cast member is the ape of the Param, whose name I can't even remember. Two: There are no flat girls, as a class A lolicon I cannot accept that. Three: The ending. Unfortunately they had to ruin it, and instead of ending the anime with a broken Alka the girl is saved by the busty-blonde (who found revenge bitter after all)  in the last half of the final episode. Honestly I could do without that. Fourth: You never understand the story of the villain, or tha nature of the evil magic Param uses. Yeah I get that she's a tortured soul like Alka but... Who the f$\"\u00a3 is she? Anyway, ignoring those (and they can be pretty easily ignored) I definitely suggest watching this if you're a fan of action or if you're looking for some food for thought.",

            "content": "Contains spoilers, but still you should read as I'm telling you why you shouldn't watch this anime.\r\nI'm writing this review just to warn people who come to watch this anime because of their interest in the game, like myself.\r\nBeware, this anime is super bad, in every way, when it shows some good points, it's only let down by something else, nothing good comes from watching this anime, you'll lose interest after the second episode, and half way though you'll be forcing yourself to continue just for the sake of completion. Let me explain why this anime is so horrific:\r\n1. The story... The story has somerelations to the game, which is obviously expected, but it just doesn't have any punch to it, it's so bland, it hardly makes sense, there is no background story, no history. Sure, you know why Alka (the main character) is after Jin Varel, for revenge, but it's pathetic, it just follows Alka's path of vengeance and there is no plot what so ever here. It takes a twist towards the end of the anime, after Alka supposedly kills Jin Varel, but she comes back to life, but you don't even know she is coming back to life until she is actually up and walking and hunting down Alka again. And by the way, you never do find out why Jin Varel killed Master Hon (Alka's reason for taking revenge). Atrocious.\\n\\n\r\n2. The art... The art could have been the one good point of this anime, and actually not being so bad, it was let down by the poor syncing and the dreadful animation. There were times where the characters were talking in animation, but actually no sound coming from them, no voice over, they were just mouthing or something? I doubt that was intended, it happened multiple times and it was so frustrating to see, it was cheap. There was another time, where a character was just walking on the spot, doing the same animation over and over, while they were talking over the top, like a game that had froze. So despite the art not being too bad on the eye, it was let down dramatically until the point where it was frustrating to watch.\\n\\n\r\n3. The sound... Over dramatic breathing, makes you think you're watching hentai, and have to turn the volume down and be on the edge of your seat constantly listening out for your parents. At least the closing song was good (in my opinion).\\n\\n\r\n4. The characters... Oh my gosh, where to even get started, the characters were so BORING. They had nothing about them, no history, or very vague history at most. There was no explanation as to how Jin Varel came impure, and how Alka was born into the clan of the sword. The main character Alka, hardly said a word, it was watching her static face and hearing her over dramatic breathing as things happened around her, she is utterly the most boring main character I have ever came across. The proprietress shows potential, however nothing comes of it, you don't really learn much about her, other than the fact that Alka killed her man in the past, you don't know how she developed her fighting skills, or how she became the proprietress, and that can be said for every other single character in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n5. The enjoyment... Huh? There is none. I was bored throughout, despite one scene which looked like the producers put all their time and effort into, a battle between Alka and Jin Varel, and it still wasn't even that good to be fair.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're coming to watch this anime, because you play the game, you'll find some relations, but you won't learn anything about the game, and you certainly won't enjoy watching the anime. And that's my review, it turned into more of a rant, but how can that be helped, watch and you'll see. But please save your life and watch something more interesting.\\n\\n",

The characters were well thought out and interesting. The visuals were a treat to look at. It delivered what it offered and I\u2019m glad I watched it. But I do have one complaint I wish to address to pad this review. The character of Hazuki is poor designed and overused to virtually no effect. I feel the show could\u2019ve done without her. Some may dislike this show because of all the T & A and that\u2019sfine. Personally I felt the story and action were engaging enough to ignore the fan service and just  enjoy the show.",

            "content": "Story & Characters: \r\nBlade & Soul tells the story of Alka, an emotionless assassin, who seeks to avenge her murdered Master. Killing and death is very much in the focus in Blade & Soul but it succeeds in showing what a double-edged sword killing truly is. Blade & Soul shows a nice character progress, being relatively short 1-cour series does show through as sometimes the development is slightly too sudden. In the end Blade & Soul is a story of Alka growing up and becoming more aware of the world that surrounds her, it truly is filled with likeable characters and I surprisingly didn't findoverly annoying characters in this show. What did bother me was the fact that not all characters past could be told and were left untold, again likely due to the fact that it is only 1-cour series but they did very well regardless. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: \\n\r\nThe art and animation in Blade & Soul was good and the fights were smoothly done and action packed. The characters were beautifully made (although all very heavy in the boob department) and the show was overall very pleasing visually. The music wasn't really anything astonishing and I wasn't particularly impressed with either the opening nor the ending music. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: \\n\r\nIn the end I did enjoy Blade & Soul although it did have minor problems which were caused by the fact that this IS indeed an anime based on a game. There were some things left unexplained which bothered me a bit (and the game isn't avaible in English either so fuck you NCSoft for leaving me in the cold). You would usually think that after getting 7/9/7/8/8, you'd get 8 for overall but this isn't the case here. The character development and art was very good and overall I did enjoy the show very much but the story just lacks enough punch to bump this anime to an 8 and it does show through at the end of the anime. But that being said Blade & Soul is much better than what you'd expect out of a game adaptation and is definately worth watching if you're into action and appreciate the good art in anime.",

It has a lot of diferent powers and characters really interesting and you are waiting to know more about them and.... you will be waiting for it all the anime long. There\u00b4s no explanation that reveal the true of the story Thinks happend when they must and thats all. I still wondering why its named Blade and Soul. they only talk about soul in some moments that try to be intense and oving but they end up being crap. So they fucked upwith the argument.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nthis anime seems to have some elements computered-animated, personally i dont dislike them, but excetp the main characters, the rest of the characters and the enviroment don\u00b4t have a good animation in my opini\u00f3n. The other big problem with this anime are transitions, the studio thaat made this anime hasnt heard about them, putting the picture on black and turnning off the music isnt the right way to change scenes.( I left fanservice behind) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 2\\n\r\nI think thats the most important part of an anime, a good soundtrack can make you be glue to the screen and this anime dont have it. It has a pretty high number of songs and the opening isn\u00b4t so bad, but the rest of the music is completely generic, it transmit nothing, don\u00b4t matter if alka is fighting or about to die.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nThey are all females, OK. They all have big \"OPPAIS\", OK. The problem is that the have no history behind them, except alka that you will see some flashbacks about her life, almost the rest of the characters don\u00b4t have a past, purpose or a goal, they are part of the anime because the studio cound\u00b4t do an anime only with a character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nIf u have nothing to see, or you want to see it while your doing another thing its okey. You won\u00b4t probably like it, but it will entertain you. The lastest episoies improve a little bit, and the last one, which is different form the rest, its the best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3",

And that wasn't for revenge, at least, due to her lack of emotions, it seemed that way to me. \r\nBut during the course of the story, her evolve at aslow but extremely well built pace. The other characters also had great development, Karen in particular.\\n\r\nBut, it all culminates on the end, when someone ask her what she was doing and Aruka answered \"living\".\\n\\n\r\nThe story could be seen as an unique genre of it's own. Almost like a Action Fantasy slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nI'll say again.

            "content": "*only really minor spoilers here\r\nWatching the first 8 episodes of Blade and Soul feels like you're just watching another fantasy medival anime, albeit a very bad one. The story feels rather rushed and is vaguely explained, the characters are flat, and lack any meaningful depth or connection to them. \r\nWhat got me through this anime for those episodes was the somewhat decent animation, and a little hope that the anime would improve itself. It eventually did, with the second half delivering more emotion, character development, and brings and interesting twist to the story. It eventually reverted back to being your typical hero vs Big badguy towards the end, but the main character motives are better understood and the ending was conclusive. It still left a lot of questions unanswered and quite a bit of flat characters though. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I didn't particularly like was the way the anime tries to develop their characters and progress the story by introducing new characters every episode, only to kill them later on in the SAME EPISODE. This is somewhat similar to what Akame ga Kill did, showing the side characters backstory in one episode and killing them in that same episode. This may work with a lot of people (and in AGK it did), but for me it just won't do.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about things that are mixed, there is also the animation. Sometimes the fight scene can make you go wow with some stunning shots and cheography, but most of the time it is just average. Animation consistency is decent with the some strange inconsistencies (mainly one of the final episodes, they were just probably saving budget to animate the following episode, which has a big fight scene). Women character designs are good though, if a not on a little bit of the fanservices side. They look good and stand out, but you kinda feel a little bit jarring when almost any woman in the anime has big breasts and huge asses. \\n\\n\r\nHave you guessed why I wrote \"women character designs\" instead of \"Character designs\" yet? Because the character designs for the male characters in this anime are nonexistent. They either be extremely ugly, or extremely generic if you are being generous. This probably won't pose a problem to the viewers, because 95% of the main chracters are females anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM used in the anime is rather standard, but I was pleasantly surprised by the ending, \"RAINBOW\" by LEGO BIG MORL. Not only the ending music is good, but the animation accompanied by it was simply amazing, even if it is CGI. The opening is trash though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Blade and Soul is not good, nor bad. It didn't do anything well, but that doesn't mean it did a bad job either. Other than the twist after the first 8 episodes, and the simply top notch ending, There is nothing that is particularly good or new that can be had in this anime. \\n\r\nI definitely had some fun while watching this anime, but would I recommend it to anyone though? Probably not. There are animes that are more worthy of your time than Blade and Soul.\\n\\n\r\nSo, as a summary,\\n\r\nWatch if you want:\\n\r\n- fanservice, characters with big boobs\\n\r\n- somewhat intersting fight scenes, battles\\n\r\nDon't watch it if you want: \\n\r\n- a decent story\\n\r\n- memorable characters\\n\r\n- beautiful animations (art is rather debatable though)\\n\\n\r\nScores:\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nArt, animation: 6/10\\n\r\nmusic: 7/10 (just for that godly ED)\\n\r\ncharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nenjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 6/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

But then it failed me...\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe story overall is blurry and I don't think it's really interesting. To be honest I just finished watching the anime for the sake of finishing it. The episodes I think did not fit together to tell the story continuously, I think in general it's poorly made. Even the ending was so dull.\r\nArt: 5/10\r\nIt was so pretentious. The characters when closed up are very defined but once it's not you'll seehow everything sucks, it seems as if the characters are drawn by someone who doesn't even draw manga or whatever. I only did notice these changes come the latter part of the series tho, at first I think it's not there but after some episodes I dunno maybe the animators got bored or something.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI think they did an okay job with the voice actors, they suit the characters well. I also like the ending song with the Proprietress dancing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nThe characters are blurry at start and didn't even grow as a character at least for me. Except for the Proprietress, I like her characters and storyline. Besides her I think all the characters are poorly conceptualized. I also did not like how the antagonists don't really have something inside them that makes them act the way they are acting, it's just too vague.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of watching an anime with all the boobies bouncing around then maybe you'll enjoy this. I won't rewatch this one, it's a waste of time. \\n\r\nOverall: 4.2\\n\r\nIt was a disappointment for me to watch this anime of the game that I wanted to play so much for a very long time. Even the gif(s) I made for this anime suck.",

            "content": "I'm going to get my biggest praise out of the way now: The ending credits kick ass! Seriously, you have to watch at least that once. The animation and song are both absolutely fantastic, and I literally (and I mean it in its denotational sense) ignored the attractive woman doing the fan dance in favor of the effects surrounding the fan and her.\r\nNow to serious stuff:\r\nThe characters are sort of well rounded and generally likable, but still hit on some of the tropes, namely being emotionally dead inside and lo-and-behold therein lies all your problems. Oh, and let's not forget that you have to havesomething to protect as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is solid throughout the whole series except for one episode for about 1.5 minutes where it looks like the heroes are riding past a background painted on plywood.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the big problems is that very few things are fully explained, namely the Impurity stuff. So sometimes you have to burn it for incense, other times you have to boil it and drink the resulting water, other times all it does is cause hallucinations, sometimes it blows people up, sometimes makes a shockwave, sometimes it makes you strong, and sometimes it's just a pretty \"poison\" that noone properly explains. That's world-building spackle, kinda like how the Force can do whatever it needs to in Star Wars.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot's a little all over the place, and the lack of continuity makes it harder to engage in watching. If I were forced to watch it again (I hate re-watching or re-reading anything), I would do it at about one episode a day, because nothing about the ending of the previous episode really pushes me onto the next.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that's worth noting is that the ecchi is entirely arbitrary. There's no reason there couldn't have been more important male characters, the female characters couldn't have dressed in a more, either western fantasy or traditional anime, style and it would have sacrificed nothing. The last episode in particular was really the only ecchi episode, but I would say it was a fair palate cleanser after all the death, sadness, etc. from the story proper.\\n\\n\r\nI do like that the female characters are strong (for most of the series), but when protagonist du jour discovers feelings again, she's essentially incapacitated for four episodes, and it get's really dull. However, I think that that leads me to my final point:\\n\\n\r\nThere might be some reference to the story of Buddha. After getting her emotions, Alka finally 'sees' the old, the sick, and the dead. Though I think the argument falls apart a bit when she goes on about actually living instead of being an ascetic.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: Sure, go ahead and watch it. I'm sure you'd think it's around a 6 or 7 too. It was good for me just because I was running out of things to read and watch when I got home at night.",

            "content": "This is a review of the Blu-ray version of \"Blade & Soul\" released by Sentai Filmworks in 2015. It was viewed with English voice overs.\r\n\"Blade & Soul\" falls into the category of fantasy action adventure.\r\nParental Advisory:\r\nThe age rating on the Blu-ray case is listed as MA (meaning 17+), though that rating may seems a bit too high.  There is almost no nudity besides a couple of brief backside shots of unclothed females, and a couple of spots where using the player's freeze frame option may detect a bare breast or two.  There is combat violence in several episodes, and some of the deathsor injuries seem a bit gruesome or disturbing, but it isn't overly graphic.  As a result, this show would likely be suitable for teens 15 and up.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nThe show spans 13 episodes.  The story was interesting, and it contained some twists I didn't expect.  Some things were not well explained, and I suspect a few of those may be related to aspects of the game.  The very first episode reminded me a bit of the setup for the Seven Samurai (or the later Magnificent Seven) where a village seeks to hire help to protect themselves.  However, after convincing the main protagonist Alka, an emotionless female assassin, to help them, things quickly spiral out of control for the village.  Alka is left wandering through most of the episodes, continually hunted.  Some of the characters she meets have unexpected ties and the outcomes from those include some rather big and unexpected plot twists.  By the end, the once emotionless Alka has undergone so many tests of will that she can't even stand to fight against her main opponent, who herself has undergone her own plot twist. \\n\\n\r\nAcross the first 12 episodes, the episodes shift from being mere adolescent titillation to much more serious content.  By the end of the 12th episode, both the characters and the audience has undergone some serious mental angst.  One prominent theme in several episodes is revenge, and how different people deal with it or try to exact it upon others.  The mental torture that is exacted upon certain characters  was devastating to watch.  I also found some of the scenarios to be thought-provoking, without clear right/wrong answers. \\n\\n\r\nThe final 13th episode is largely a throw-away \"beach\" episode that seems to exist purely for fan service.  It could have been left out entirely, and it seems more like an OVA rather than anything canon.  It just seemed like an excuse to show some of the characters in even skimpier outfits, and it really didn\u2019t fit into the rest of the series.   Including it at the end  also seemed to weaken the overall impact of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nVisually, the female cast are beautifully illustrated.  They also offer some serious eye candy since some of them tend to wear rather skimpy attire.  Anyone that doesn't understand the reasons for fantasy-based outfits existing in a fantasy world should probably stay away.  Please find a documentary on the history channel about period armors if that's what you're looking for.  This isn't it.  In addition, most of the female characters in this show are rather well-endowed, though by current anime standards and depending on specific genre, they aren't that unusual.   \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Alka, is a bit of an enigma.  She is an ultra-skilled assassin, but utterly emotionless at the beginning.  Through flashbacks and other revelations, we continually learn more about her past.   Due to the events that transpire, her character undergoes profound mental changes in the last half of the series.  I found it hard to like her as a cold-blooded emotionless killer, but I also felt sorry for some of the situations she ends up having to deal with.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Alka, there are a trio of beautiful women that are featured prominently through the series.  The proprietor Karen, the bounty hunter Hazuki and the bandit leader Roana.  Each of them have different motives, but end up being tied in some way to Alka or her mission.\\n\r\nThe main villain Jin Varel and her associates are featured in several episodes.  Jin seems equally cold and emotionless to Alka.\\n\\n\r\nA few other characters are also introduced such as a merchant who appears at different times or a girl saved from a village.  None of the lesser characters are developed much in their limited screen time.\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation: 9/10\\n\r\nMost of the characters, scenery and animation are gorgeous.  Even the end credits are spectacular featuring what seems like motion captured dancing since the animation is so smooth and fluid.  While the female characters look great, the art for the male characters seems like an afterthought.\\n\\n\r\nSound / Voice: 8/10\\n\r\nThe music during the intro and end credits is very good.  The background music and sound effects were all effective.  However, the voice acting for some of the characters such as Alka and Hazuki seemed a bit weak.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nWhile the series is visually stunning, the emotionless natures of the main character Alka and the villain Jin Varel end up being anchors that prevent the series from lifting up to its full potential.  The elements for a good story are here.  With a different delivery and some changes for the main character and villain, it could have been much, much better. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 7/10 \\n\r\nWhile far from perfect, \u201cBlade & Soul\u201d is worth seeing at least once.  The characters, animation and visuals are beautifully drawn and animated, and overall the story is intriguing and includes a few thought-provoking situations.  However, the series never manages to rise to its full potential.  For a show titled \u201cBlade & Soul\u201d, it seemed more \u201cBlade\u201d and little to no \u201cSoul\u201d.\\n",

I really enjoyed watching her transformation from an emotionless assassin to her old human self who was capable of feeling emotion. I must say I actually enjoyed the ending. When she throws that gold piece I had to wonder what kind of  \"work\" was she doing to get that? I also contemplated the idea that she was still an assassin, but a \"good\" assassin that had morals and didn't just kill anyone without hesitation. many people don't like it but personally this one isgoing into the books as one of my favs. It's always fun to have an ending u can morph to what u think based on the information given. that's one think I really liked.  kinda like the last batman movie. u cam either believe he lived, or died based on the cafe scene. u use your imagination to make the ending witch I think blade and soul nailed.  \\n\\n\r\np.s episode 12 was the true ending. episode 13 was just for fun, but the end of ep 13 is kinda important\\n",

            "content": "___________This Review contains a bit of Spoilers____________________\r\nThe Story:\r\nMy oh my where do I start. The story is about Alka a girl who was born into a clan of dangerous sword users. Basically to sum up the story without making it too long. She goes on a journey to find the person who killed her master. Seems like a promising story right? wrong. The story in my opinion lacked depth and any real reasoning behind anything especially after episode 8 when Alka kills Jin Varel, Then she ends up being revived so they can fight again.   Rating: 3/10  \r\nArt:  \r\nThe art inmy opinion is nothing special it's pretty average nothing really special, but I will admit that the world is very beautiful. Which is why I'll score the art as high as I will.   Rating: 5/10  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:  \\n\r\nSame as the art pretty average nothing special.    Rating:  4/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  \\n\r\nNow this is where the show's main faults are I'll break down the characters who need to be talked about.  Which are these five main ladies: Alka, Jin Varel, Karen, Hazuki and Roana.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nAlka: The badass assassin with the personality of a cardboard box. Jesus christ this series was boring mainly because of her. I had to watch a character show no emotion. She barely changed her facial expressions until later episodes which made me question why she was the main focus. I saw supporting characters with my facial expressions then her. She was super anti-social unless a character mentioned something about Jin Varel, but she eventually starts to change that annoying blank face after the later episodes. \\n\\n\r\nJin Varel: Aka Alka 2.0. Jin suffers the same as Alka a cardboard personality. I really can't write much for her character mainly due to the fact that you can never really understand what's her damage. She stays quiet just like Alka and barely ever talks. I could bet that she only said a total of 16 words throughout the series.  Just like Alka I find it really hard to care about her character because she does nothing important to make you really give a damn.    \\n\\n\r\nKaren: Honestly I felt as if she was the most decent character in the show since she had some personality mainly due to her dark side of making Alka suffer for what she did to her lover. Another thing she impressed me with was the fact that she along with Jin Varel are the only two out of the main characters who actually cover themselves with real clothes. (Until episode 13 ._.) Karen had a back story which was a bit sad, but she managed to make me care about her character even though it was very little. She's honestly the only character who I don't really have anything negative to say.    \\n\\n\r\nHazuki: -sigh- I honestly hated her the most to be completely honest. She did nothing at all besides shooting her guns and getting drunk. She could have been Killed off and the show would not have changed in the slightest. She is honestly one of the weakest links in the show and I honesty wish she wasn't in it.  \\n\\n\r\nRoana: The leader of the pleasure gang. The pleasure gang was know for being a group of raiders who were against the palam empire. Her group basically got wiped out by Jin Varel with ease. Roana and two of her members survived the attack and basically did nothing special throughout the rest of the series. She kinda had no motives, but to fight Jin Varel to avenge her deceased gang members.   \\n\r\nRating: 2/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThere was nothing really to enjoy the show disappointed me in every aspect.  I wanted to drop this anime so many times after watching it, but I'm not the kind of person who likes to drop animes so I forced myself through it. It really was a waste of my time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBefore I give a final verdict on the show I'll just place the  pros and cons   \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Beautiful Fantasy World\\n\r\n-The fighting scenes aren't memorable but they're done decently.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Show does not have very memorable moments\\n\r\n-Characters are ridiculously boring and don't help the show at all.\\n\r\n-The plot is ridiculously weak and boring. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n This isn't the worst show ever possibly since I went in with low expectations, but It was pretty bad. I honestly could not reccomend a show like this mainly due to the fact that it did nothing to make itself memorable. The Main character is completely boring, The plot is weak and literally goes no where. Beautiful world, but that can't save this train wreck of a show. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: Forget this anime and look for something worth your time. You'll be upset that you wasted your time watching this show.\\n\\n\\n",

The story seemed fairly interesting in the first 2 episodes, but as it carried on everything became the question of \"What the hell am I watching right now?\" and not in a good way. The art was basic, but as the show progressed it got worse, by becoming more and more inconsistent and lazy.  The animation quality was inconsistent. The same case as previously stated, as the show progressed, the quality dropped significantly, and in around episode 10-11--after Isaw them animate fire the way they did, which in itself was pretty laughable--I was so done. Sound was probably the only thing about this show that was passable. The characters in the show had such generic personalities, it was hard to make a connection with any of them. it didn't even seem like they were trying anymore. It's almost as if the studio itself thought what they were working on was garbage so they decided to do the most minimal job they could possibly get away with.",

And since they dont want to spoil the fun of the story in the game, the anime has a different ending from it.\r\nThe story itself is pretty meh. The main charecter seeks vengence for the death of his master and thats about it.\r\nThe visuals and the combat in both the anime and the game are awesome, its worth to see/play it justfor that.\\n\\n\r\nSo to fill the role of your charecter we have Aluka/Alka, a walking goddess of beauty and ownage... much like Mikasa per say.\\n\r\nTo sum it up she has a bit of superpowers that she'll rarely use but is mostly a well trained assassin from the sword clan.\\n\r\nThe sword clan is the OP guild of ninja assassin that for some reason get dominated by 3 people. Watching the anime alone would give you no explanation how the hell does that happen BUT the game does.\\n\r\nSo thoes 3 black dressed people attack the clan so they can get The Sword of Whatever-its-name-was and kill all of the students. Thats untill THE MASTER rages and wipes the floor with them, BUT they get to the last student ... You (Alka). Thretening the master that they'll kill his last student and his clan will be no more unless he surrenders and gives up The sword of epic domination.\\n\r\nAnd so he does... they get the sword, kill the master and kick you (Alka) from the cliffs into the sea. And thats how the story begins.\\n\r\nThe anime itself is pretty straight forward: she seeks vengence, kills people, meets some friends along the way, kills more people, boss fight.\\n\r\nThere is some backstory to back it up buuuut meh, its still worth to watch just for the fights and the well done animation.\\n\r\nAnd if you want to know the full story, well then... prepare for 30 hrs of game time ;D",

            "content": "Character Development-\r\nGreat! But, just for the main character. Supporting characters seem to have no use later in the show. The characters you wanted to see more of didn't get to shine as much as you would like.\r\nAnimation-\r\nAnimation looks great, but it's kind of a fake-great. If you are viewing backgrounds, details on characters, and effects, you'll notice that they are completely under-detailed, especially later in the show. At one point a background character was literally walking in place for 4 seconds holding a bag. \r\nSound-\r\nThe sound is okay, not the best i've ever heard. Very few themes caught my attention while watching. Definitely not ashow with a showcase of great music. It gets the job done though.\\n\\n\r\nOther Characters-\\n\r\nSupporting characters seemed to have a role throughout the show, but their goals with said role were rather the same. Almost every single supporting character can be linked back with Alka one way or another. To put it shortly, the supporting characters make Alka feel like crap, and make her wonder why she feels like crap then come to some sort of conclusion to not feel like crap.\\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\r\nThe story jumped around a bit. I can say a bunch of the stuff you wanted to know about was left unanswered. I'm not sure if this is setting up for another season, or to be explained within the Blade And Soul game, which isn't in North America yet and I don't think many characters within the show exist in the game.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is just average with some good and bad points. The best thing it did was character development, but that's about all I can praise it for. If you want a quick show about women and fighting with some okay story thrown in, this is the show for you.",

I think it's pretty awesome for a anime based on a game. The OST it's amazing, but the arts and the characters, save for Alka (or Aruka) are a little \"i don't care\". One scene is beautiful and another is like my little sister drawing. I like the anime, but it have some fails. It's a good thing to watch when you don't have nothing to do.\r\nEsse \u00e9 meu primeiro review, mas voutentar. Blade & Soul come\u00e7a meio clichezinho, mas depois sofre algumas reviravoltas incr\u00edveis. Para um anime baseado em um jogo \u00e9 muito impressionante. As m\u00fasicas s\u00e3o incr\u00edveis, e em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao tra\u00e7o, e uma coisa meio Hunter x Hunter, uma hora t\u00e1 lindo e na outra ta tipo minha irm\u00e3 de 4 anos desenhando. A hist\u00f3ria dos personagens, n\u00e3o contando a principal, deixam muito a desejar. Mas \u00e9 um bom anime. \u00c9 daqueles para se ver quando voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tem nada para fazer.",

No time to attach to them as Alka kills them. \r\nCast is made up of women, very few men in this anime and if there are any, they are weak. On top of that Alka the main character does not articulate morethan a few words during the entire series, not phrases, just words.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the battle scenes are nicely made (in the beginning), for some reason the graphics get worse near the end, final battle is quite dark and quite badly animated in my opinion, but in the beginning things look a lot better. The characters especially the main antagonist does not look so good in the final episode. Seems like a big budget cut at some point in the series but they had no choice but to finish it\\n\\n\r\nSound is good however it gets worse in the end, was not a fan of how they did the final battle, animation and sound wise. \\n\\n\r\nIf you decide to watch, do it for the battle scenes especially in the first few episodes, after that there isn't much left to enjoy.\\n",

            "content": "In this videogame-adaptation, sexy badass ladies fight each other in a vagely described dark fantasy-/spaghetti western'ish/steampunk'ish world. The main character is a freakin' ninja-lady without any sort of emotional connection when it comes to killing people. And she's out for revenge on a magic bitch who killed her master, all the while being persued by bounty hunters and an evil organisation hellbound on finding her for various reasons.\r\nThis sounds awesome, right? I mean, it's all there: badass chicks, a cool and interesting world to explore, a studio that knows how to handle crazy, over-the-top fights between ridiculously busty ladies just fine (see Vandread and Witchblade).And y'know what? It is! It absolutely is...\\n\r\n... for three episodes, before this series turns into one of the most depressing and disappointing trainwrecks I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nY'know, off the top of my head I can only think of exactly THREE anime that made me legitimately angry...:\\n\\n\r\n... Burn Up! Scramble, which was a fucking chore to sit through after I had a lot of fun with Warrior and Excess, despite their respective flaws.\\n\\n\r\n... Master of Martial Hearts, and the less said about this piece of shit the better.\\n\\n\r\n[btw.: Honorable mention goes out to Wizard Barristers, for ARMS pooping their pants in the last two episodes - but I wasn't really angry at the show, I was angry at ARMS. And I still am. 'cause fuck ARMS.]\\n\\n\r\n... and this one.\\n\r\nI started watching B&S (appropriate abbreviation) because of one thing only: GONZO was involved. And I used to love GONZO, no matter how much my friends hated them. Some of my favorite anime were made by them (Blue Sub No. 6, Welcome to the NHK, Pumpkin Scissors), I defended a lot of their output because I genuinely liked their ruthless approach at animating stuff - shit, I even dug the ending of the Gantz-series.\\n\\n\r\nBut B&S broke me. B&S not only broke my spirit in terms of defending GONZO, it almost made me quit watching anime alltogether. I wanted to like it, I really did. I accepted a lot of its drawbacks (increasingly bad animation with each new episode, horrid CGI - even by GONZO's standards -, the severe lack of clever dialogue and interesting characters by the time the series lost its way like the damn song in Kill la Kill...) with a handwave, just hoping it would get its shit together, bounce back and be as awesome as its first three episodes. But it didn't, until the very last episode - and by then it was way too late for me to give a crap about anything, really. I was done by that point.\\n\\n\r\nIt starts out like a really cool, oldschool revenge-tale in a fantasy world and comes right out of the gate with decapitations, a village burning the fuck down, guns blazing, people dying by the dozens, a The Good, The Bad and the Ugly'esque standoff-sequence and an amazingly well-choreographed fight scene between a ninja and a gunslinger that reminded me of 90's-hongkong-wuxia flicks \u00e1 la Butterfly and Sword or Hero (the 1997 Corey Yuen-film, not the other one).\\n\\n\r\nBut then, someone in the writing department had the bright idea to introduce a plot that went beyond \"Find bitch -> fight bitch's lackeys -> fight bitch -> kill bitch -> roll credits\". And I was fine with the series taking a more serious approach at first - but little by little, B&S stopped being fun. And then it became annoying, boring, dull, stupid and anger-inducing at the same time. Especially the latter took over at some point (around episode 9, I think), and I sat there in front of my TV, shouting numerous swear words at the screen with every new stupid, mind-numbingly boring sequence the anime threw at me.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is not the fact that anime wanted to tell a serious story. Again, as with Martial Hearts, B&S took the completely ass-backwards approach of introducing the serious shit at the most inappropriate time and in the most jarring way possible. One does not simply introduce a pulpy fantasy world with pulpy fantasy characters who fight each other in pulpy ways for about two hours worth of television time, only to swerve into a weirdly composed episodic format with a \"moral lesson of the day\"-plotline, disregarding the main plot (\"Find bitch -> kill bitch\") entirely for hamfisted drama surrounding our protagonist's lack of ambition and emotion. You can TRY to give your main protagonist emotional depth by, oh I don't know, maybe not having her be a lifeless vessel of a human being whose only characteristics are her appearance and the fact that she's really really good at killing shit.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time the melodramatic bullshit, that starts around episode 4, doesn't even fucking involve her at all! She's just a bystander looking at people debating over whether or not they should plant fantasy-opium (yes, fantasy-opium) to gain money, looking at people who become obsessed with being the good guys, looking at people obsessing over a family member she might've killed - she just looks at shit as if she was Kim Jong-Il looking at things, she does jack shit most of the time to prevent bad things from happening, she doesn't learn shit every time she messes up, and she sure as shit doesn't evolve as a character until the FINAL GODVERDOMME EPISODE when she has her freaking Shinji-moment and goes \"Hey, guys, guess what - I AM ME! I'M HUMAN! YAY! OMEDETO, ALKA-KUN!\".\\n\\n\r\nThe writing and pacing in this show are fucking bad, 's all I'm sayin'. It breaks the show's neck four episodes in, and then GONZO tries to kinda fix it by the time B&S ends with an admittedly well-choreographed wuxia-fight scene. But was that scene worth waiting for, like, ten freaking episodes? Hell naw, by the time you get to it you're already desinterested in ANYTHING the show had going for itself when it started. You just want it to end. And when it ends, it's as disappointing an ending as you might expect.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad it turned out this way, because up until B&S lost it I was really surprised at how good everything looked (except the horrible CGI). The fight scenes are engaging and fun to watch, the setting makes for a cool atmosphere and some really nice background art, the character designs are average but still acceptable, the soundtrack is pretty cool and Yuki Takao's performance as the heroine Alka - despite her being a useless twat most of the time - is one of my personal highlights in this show (the rest of the cast is alright, I just wish they would've taken the entire thing a little less serious and went a little bit more ham). There is merit to be found here, it's just burried under the writing staff's complete lack of talent.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really too bad, there was a ton of potential to just give us a kickass dark fantasy-action romp with cool characters, badass fight scenes and an overall schlocky low budget-wuxia-atmosphere. Instead, B&S went for the angsty route - and failed miserably. And it was the fact that all this talent (the director of this also helmed the direction duties for Steins;Gate, Texhnolyze and Vampire Hunter D - Bloodlust) and all this potential was flushed down the toilet that made me so angry and bitter and made me turn my back on anime for a month or so. Well, maybe the fact that I had completed two anime prior to that that I really didn't like at all had something to do with it. I think the first one was Burn-Up! Scramble, and the other one was Master of Martial Hearts, if I remember correctly.\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nHuh. I had a really bad run back then, didn't I?\\n\\n\r\nLuckily though, I got what I wanted out of this piece of crap a year later with Shingeki no Bahamut - Genesis. Thanks, MAPPA.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nTo quote a very famous critic: I hated this show. Hated, hated, hated, hated this show. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it after episode 4. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.\\n\\n\r\nGoddammit, GONZO!",

            "content": "I was excited when I found out that there is an anime adaptation of my most anticipated \r\nMMORPG, Blade and Soul. Upon watching the anime for the first time, the episode kind of clicked with me but the later episode just feels like chewing a flavorless piece of gum for hours but I was interested of what will happen next to the emotionless character. Speaking of emotionless character, I don't particularly hate the anime for having an emotionless main character because she's a heartless assassin with a tragic past (how many times have we heard of this trope before?). What I hate about this animeis that it was unnecessary to be made because the story in the game was more well elaborated rather than a rushed 10+ episode story. I also find it funny that the main character speaks LESS than the side character, seriously! I think if you were to add ALL of the dialogue choices in the game (because you are mainly a silent protagonist), you'll have a longer script than the main character in the anime. As for animation goes, it was meh. In some scenes, the fire were so bland and texture-less that ANYONE can tell the problem with the fire right away even if they have watched one or two anime in their life. The opening theme song was pretty catchy and it fits the whole atmosphere and setting with the anime. What I found distasteful of the anime is that through out the story, the main character goes through her journey and learning how to become a better person and speaking more as a result but later was ruined by a distasteful generic anime beach episode solely for fan service. The animation team COULD HAVE removed the last episode budget to give their fire a little more texture (if you know what I mean). Do I recommend the anime? No, absolutely not.",
