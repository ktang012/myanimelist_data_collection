The best moment would be maybe while we're spacing out during a boring lesson in our classroom or when we're just slacking off a bit at our working place, or if our personality is that of the \"pensive\" type we already have a space in our schedule to muse about the little events in our lives, leaving aside the type of personality we've, I'm pretty sure we do all have asked ourselves the unavoidable question \"What if...\" didn't we?.\\n\\n\r\n\"Maybe I should have seated next to that pretty girl in the bus, but instead I\u2019ve decided to stand up\".\\n\\n\r\nJust an example, how can my life change due to that mundane and maybe insignificant event?, impossible to know it and for that I question myself now \"What if I\u2019ve seated with that girl?\", a quick reply to that question could be, even if it\u2019s a little creative, that I could have talked with her a little during the ridesharing, I could have found that she's a wonderful girl and she thinks nice of me, next day she could have reserved the sit for me and again we start to talk, this could have lead me to ask her out, to fall in love, get engaged and when I didn't even realize it I've already married that girl. What was the triggering event for that?, \"a stupid and mundane choice when I was young\" would be the answer of an older version of myself, or maybe, a more realistic scenery would be that the girl gets off of that bus and it was the last time I saw her, anyway it wouldn't be completely wrong to say that we're the product of our choices, but not only, since also the people we meet have the power to change us considerably; maybe you're asking \"what does all this things have to do with the review and with this anime?\" to that I reply \"quite everything\", since \"we're the product of our Choices\" is the main theme of the anime I'm now going to introduce you, The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\n(Since our protagonist is nameless I shall now refer to him, from now on, as \"The Protagonist\")\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the development of the story, we can see how different can be the life of The Protagonist based on the choices he had made and the people he had meet during his first year of University. The premise of this anime is to show us how different could be our lives due to a choice, in our protagonist's case, the choice of a Club to join. How can the choice of joining a certain Club be considered as something important, something that could change completely our lives?, at a first gaze I would say \u201cit\u2019s quite improbable\" but I couldn't be more wrong and for our protagonist that couldn't be more true. The Cinema Club?, Tennis Club?, Softball Club?, English Club?, it doesn't matter; all of this show is about The Protagonist's pursuit of his \u201crose-colored campus life\u201d and what would be that? well it's Everyone's dream: being popular, a lot of friends and a cute girlfriend but that's something that reveals to be a particulary difficult goal to reach for our timid protagonist and lucky isn't even by his side since someone is obstructing him and that obstruction it's represented by a physical person, another character of this anime, Ozu. The relation between Ozu and The Protagonist is a bit weird but I totally loved it, Ozu could be or your best friend or you worst enemy, depending how you approach him. So through many of the clubs The Protagonist joins we're the audience of what would happen to his life if he had only joined a different club in his first year.\\n\\n\r\nThe story telling of this anime is unique, incredible unique if I must say it. We need to think of it as a puzzle, a puzzle with 11 parts (11 as the episodes of this anime), so little by little we need to fill the missing parts until it gets finished, at that moment we can actually gaze the wonderfully picture that have been created.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that strike us are the characters, they're unique in their own way, all of them have a characteristic that would lead them to being crafted into our minds, starting from The Protagonist to the Fortune Teller (you'll love that old baba!) since they are made of a simplicity and yet they're so unique that you'll have a hard time trying to get them off your head (admitted if you want to). First we have The Protagonist, he's a first year University student, quite shy and easily manipulated by the other characters of this show, especially Ozu, whose failing to obtain his precious rose colored life consider his life a total waste. Ozu, whose The Protagonist usually describe his first meet with him as \"the first as well as worst\", he's a devil like little guy but not only because of his behavior which is indeed evil (\"He eats people's unhappiness with three helpings of rice\" - The Protagonist's words) but also because of his appearance, he's also the best and only friend of our protagonist. These two are the most important characters in the show, I won't talk about each of them since Tatami Galaxy's really offer a large and above all, original and interesting cast of characters, otherwise this review could get really long. Even if the story revolves around The Protagonist, the other characters aren't less important, I would say actually they're more important than him for the development since our protagonist is a passive character; Remember?...not only the choices are important but also the people we meet could lead our lives to an unexpected turn. This anime goes that far too actually made us understand that not experiencing something is actually an experience itself, and we won't understand that until we finish this anime. The ending is something special; it gives the whole meaning for this show. Comedy isn't missing neither, this show stands out also for its comedy scenes, and every character will make you laugh in a different way, their own way. Johnny' scenes, a character's show, are memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite particular too, even if you may find it weird at the first sight, we get used to it quite fast and maybe we ask ourselves \"Why there aren't more shows like this?\u201d, The animation is Madhouse Studio, so we can count with an incredible high level animation, characteristic trademark of this studio. The OST suited perfectly every scene, from those more \" lively\" ones to those passives, but for one strange reason we don't give the deserved attention to them, that\u2019s because The Protagonist's speed light monologues will take most of our concentration, leaving the OST in the background, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Both OP/ED are amazing too, I especially liked more the OP single.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you're able to read very quickly you won't be able to leave the Pause button aside, since The Protagonist usually talks in a very speedy way that sometimes we aren't able to read the subtitles in time but that won't be the only thing to interrupt us during the vision of this anime, there are also those The Protagonist's monologues which are so filled with meaning and extremely well written that we could actually feel the urgent of going back to rewatch them, an action I actually repeat many times. It\u2019s incredible but every single phrase pronounced in this show has its own charming and filled with meaning, Wikiquote would have a lot of pages filled with our characters phrases, and I'm not referring to those clich\u00e9 ones we find everywhere, Tatami Galaxy's ones are all original.\\n\\n\r\nThere are anime with meaning and moral, there are anime with funny characters, there are anime with an incredible story and unique storytelling, but I need to say that The Tatami Galaxy was composed by all of them. I would recommend (personal experience) to rewatch this anime after some time, because its incredible the amount of particulars that could be missed the first time, after all, re-watching an anime to us dear let us appreciate those little particulars we could have missed the first time, and in The Tatami Galaxy's case I can assure you'll be surprised.\\n\\n\r\nI've expressed myself the best I could, I hope this review moves someone into watching this anime because it\u2019s really worth. I'm going to leave you, the readers, to visualize the whole boc\u00f3n of things said in this review, don't hesitate and jump into it you won\u2019t regret it, in that case I\u2019ve realized my main point for this review, otherwise I apologize for being unable to send my feelings towards this incredible anime to you since it's only my fault as a novice reviewer as I'm.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, thanks you for spending time for reading it\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Espa\u00f1ol]\\n\\n\r\nLa Vida se reduce a las decisiones tomadas. Cualquiera sea el modo en que est\u00e9 nuestra vida ahora, se debe exclusivamente a las decisiones que hemos hecho en el pasado. Lo que nos lleva a decir que no estar\u00edamos del todo en error al decir que la Vida no es nada m\u00e1s que la suma de nuestras decisiones. Personalmente soy una persona que no cree en el Destino, pues me gusta pensar que tenemos el control total de nuestras vidas, el control de las decisiones que tendremos que afrontar. Me gusta pensar que tenemos frente a nosotros una cantidad infinita de puertas en vez de una sola.\\n\\n\r\n\u00bfAlguna vez has pensado en ellas, las decisiones que has tomado? Estoy seguro que cualquiera ha dedicado, aunque sea un poco de tiempo, para meditar sobre ellas. Importantes o no, el mejor momento para ello podr\u00eda ser cuando estamos ociando durante una lecci\u00f3n aburrida en la escuela, o mientras ociamos un poco en el trabajo o, si somos del tipo pensativo, no necesitamos estar aburridos para dedicar un poco de nuestro tiempo a meditar sobre todo. Estoy seguro que al menos una vez nos hemos preguntado \"\u00bfC\u00f3mo ser\u00eda si..?\".\\n\\n\r\n\"Tal vez deber\u00eda haberme sentado al lado de esa chica, pero decid\u00ed quedarme de pie\"\\n\\n\r\nEs s\u00f3lo un ejemplo, \u00bfc\u00f3mo cambiar\u00eda mi vida debido a ese evento tan com\u00fan y corriente?. No soy capaz de saberlo y por eso si me pregunto \"\u00bfy si me hubiese sentado con ella?\" una respuesta veloz, aunque un poco creativa, ser\u00eda que habr\u00eda comenzado a charlar con ella y me dar\u00eda cuenta que es una chica estupenda y de que, sorprendentement,e ella piensa lo mismo sobre m\u00ed. Al d\u00eda siguiente me la encuentro de nuevo y comenzamos a charlar otra vez, y esto me lleva a pedirle un d\u00eda de salir conmigo, a enamorarme de ella y as\u00ed sucesivamente al matrimonio. \u00bfCu\u00e1l ser\u00eda el evento que me llev\u00f3 a todo eso? \"Una decisi\u00f3n com\u00fan y corriente cuando era joven\" ser\u00eda la respuesta de mi Yo anciano o, siendo m\u00e1s realista, la chica se baja del tren y esa fue la \u00faltima vez que la vi. No estar\u00edamos del todo errados al decir que nosotros somos el producto de decisiones, pero no solamente nuestras decisiones, pues las personas que encontramos a lo largo de nuestro camino tienen el incre\u00edble poder de cambiarnos\u2026Tal vez os est\u00e9s preguntado \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 tiene que ver todo esto con la review o con el anime?\" y a eso le respondo: \"pr\u00e1cticamente todo\", porque \"Somos el producto de nuestras decisiones\" es el tema principal de la serie que ahora les voy a presentar, The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\n(Siendo nuestro protagonista un sin nombre, lo llamar\u00e9, a partir de ahora, El Protagonista)\\n\\n\r\nA lo largo del desarrollo de la historia, podremos ver como ser\u00eda la vida de nuestro protagonista en base a las decisiones que escoge el primer a\u00f1o de universidad y a las personas que encuentra en ella. La premisa de esta historia es mostrarnos cuan diferente pueden ser nuestras vidas debido a una decisi\u00f3n que tomamos. En el caso de nuestro protagonista, la decisi\u00f3n de un Club al cual unirse. \u00bfC\u00f3mo podr\u00eda revelarse ser una decisi\u00f3n que cambiar\u00eda nuestras vidas el escoger a cu\u00e1l club pertenecer? Es algo que consider\u00e9 imposible a una primera impresi\u00f3n, algo que se puede considerar una deducci\u00f3n completamente err\u00f3nea despu\u00e9s. \u00bfEl Club de Cine? \u00bfClub de Tenis?, \u00bfFootball Club? \u00bfEl Club de Ingles? No tendr\u00eda importancia de verdad pues el objetivo de nuestro protagonista es encontrar lo que \u00e9l considera \"La vida color rosa\". \u00bfDe qu\u00e9 se trata esta? Pues eso ser\u00eda el sue\u00f1o de todo el mundo: Ser popular, muchos amigos y una bella novia, algo que, claramente, para nuestro t\u00edmido protagonista se revela ser una misi\u00f3n imposible. Ni siquiera la buena suerte lo acompa\u00f1a, pues se encuentra siempre siendo obstaculizado. El obst\u00e1culo en este caso es una persona f\u00edsica, otro personaje de este anime, mi favorito, Ozu. La relaci\u00f3n entre Ozu y El Protagonista es una de las m\u00e1s geniales que he visto. Fuera de lo normal, pero algo que completamente am\u00e9. Ozu o podr\u00eda ser tu mejor amigo o tu peor enemigo, depende de c\u00f3mo te le acerques en vuestro primer encuentro. Entonces, a lo largo de este anime, nosotros seremos los espectadores de c\u00f3mo seria la vida de nuestro pobre protagonista, y c\u00f3mo esta ser\u00eda diferente si s\u00f3lo se hubiera unido a otro club su primer a\u00f1o.\\n\\n\r\nLa narraci\u00f3n de esta historia es \u00fanica, incre\u00edblemente \u00fanica si tengo que precisar. Si queremos podemos pensar de esta como un rompecabezas: un rompecabezas de 11 piezas (11 como los episodios de este anime) que poco a poco va cogiendo forma, s\u00f3lo colocando la \u00faltima pieza es que podremos apreciar la imagen completa y admirarla es todo su esplendor.\\n\\n\r\nLa primera cosa que nos impactar\u00e1 en esta serie ser\u00edan sus personajes, los cuales son \u00fanicos en su forma de ser, hasta dejar una huella en nuestras mentes que dif\u00edcilmente desaparecer\u00e1. Comenzando por El Protagonista hasta la Vieja Adivina (\u00a1Adorar\u00e1s a esa vieja!), todos son tan simples, pero a la vez son tan \u00fanicos que dif\u00edcilmente los encontrar\u00e1s aburridos. Primero que todo tenemos a nuestro protagonista, un chico bastante t\u00edmido y reservado f\u00e1cilmente manipulable por otros, especialmente Ozu, el cual al haber fallado en su b\u00fasqueda por la \"vida color rosa\" siente que su vida hasta ahora ha sido un completo desperdicio. Despu\u00e9s tenemos a Ozu, sl cual el protagonista suele describir su primer encuentro con el como \"el primero al igual que el peor\". \\n\\n\r\n\u00c9l es un chicho mal\u00e9volo, y no s\u00f3lo por su comportamiento (\"\u00c9l se come la infelicidad de la gente con un contorno de arroz\" palabras de nuestro protagonista), sino tambi\u00e9n por su apariencia que, es de hecho, demon\u00edaca. Estos dos son los personajes m\u00e1s importantes del show. No me pondr\u00e9 a hablar sobre los dem\u00e1s porque Tatami Galaxy ofrece un cast de personajes muy amplio, pero, sobre todo, interesante y original, lo cual me tomar\u00eda mucho tiempo y esta review se pondr\u00eda muy larga. Si bien la historia gira entorno a El Protagonista, los otros personajes no son menos notables. Yo dir\u00eda que son hasta m\u00e1s importantes para el desarrollo de la historia que el propio protagonista, debido a que este \u00faltimo es un personaje pasivo, \u00bfRecuerdas?... No s\u00f3lo las decisiones son importantes, porque tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n las personajes las cuales le pueden dar un gran giro inesperado a nuestras vidas. Este anime llega tan lejos tanto da mostrarnos que no experimentar algo es una experiencia en s\u00ed y eso no lo llegaremos a comprender hasta el final de este anime. El final es algo especial, algo que le da todo un significado a la experiencia que hemos visto. La comedia no falta, de hecho este anime resalta sobretodo por su comedia, cada personaje te har\u00e1 re\u00edr en un modo diferente, el modo de cada uno de ellos. Las partes de Johnny, un personaje del show, son memorables.\\n\\n\r\nLos dise\u00f1os son bastantes particulares tambi\u00e9n. Aunque se pueden encontrar extravagantes en principio, nos acostumbramos de una manera veloz a ellos, a tal modo que nos preguntamos \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no hay m\u00e1s como estos?\". La animaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 hecha por el estudio Madhouse, famoso por la atenci\u00f3n y la extrema precisi\u00f3n en sus trabajos. Es de verdad muy fluida y perfecta. El OST encaja perfectamente en cada escena de la serie, desde las m\u00e1s pasivas hasta las m\u00e1s activas. , un particular extra\u00f1o es que por la mayor parte el OST pasa desapercibido, debido a que los mon\u00f3logos a la velocidad de la luz de nuestro protagonista se llevan la mayor parte de nuestra atenci\u00f3n, dejando el OST en un plano fuera de nuestra percepci\u00f3n, lo cual no es necesariamente algo malo. OP/ED fueron muy buenos, a m\u00ed me gust\u00f3 mucho m\u00e1s el OP single.\\n\\n\r\nSi tu capacidad de lectura no es lo suficientemente veloz estar\u00e1s pegado al bot\u00f3n de pausa. Eso es porque El Protagonista habla de una manera tan veloz que es casi imposible seguirlo, haciendo la comprensi\u00f3n algo dif\u00edcil. Pero esa no ser\u00e1 la \u00fanica vez que echaremos el video para atr\u00e1s, porque tambi\u00e9n los mon\u00f3logos de nuestro protagonista est\u00e1n tan llenos de significado que los querremos leer de nuevo. Puede ser incre\u00edble, pero cada frase dicha en esta serie es tan llena de significado y resplandece con tanta luz propia que Wikiquote tendr\u00eda p\u00e1ginas enteras s\u00f3lo con los di\u00e1logos de nuestros personajes\u2026 Y no estoy hablando de esas frases baratas que se consiguen en todas las series, las de Tatami Galaxy son todas originales.\\n\\n\r\nHay animes con significado y moral, los hay con personajes divertidos, hay animes con una incre\u00edble narraci\u00f3n y desarrollo de la historia, pero tengo que decir que The Tatami Galaxy tiene todo esto y m\u00e1s. Yo recomendar\u00eda (experiencia personal) ver de nuevo esta serie despu\u00e9s de un tiempo. De eso modo nos podemos dar cuenta de la incre\u00edble cantidad de particulares que se dejan atr\u00e1s mientras los estamos viendo por primera vez. Porque, despu\u00e9s de todo, mirar de nuevo un anime que nos gust\u00f3 nos da la posibilidad de apreciar esos peque\u00f1os detalles que nos pudimos haber saltado, y en este caso hay bastantes. \\n\\n\r\nMe exprese lo mejor que he podido, espero que esta review les ayude a decidiros a dedicar vuestro tiempo en este anime, porque de verdad lo vale. Ahora voy a dejar a ustedes, los lectores, el tiempo de visualizar todo lo que se dijo hasta ahora. Si acaso encuentran a este un poco interesante, les digo que no lo duden y denle una oportunidad, ese es el objetivo principal de esta review. Si no es as\u00ed, pues no logr\u00e9 trasmitir mis emociones sobre esta gran serie con \u00e9xito al ser a\u00fan un principiante.\\n\\n\r\nEn cualquier caso, les agradezco su tiempo.\\n\\n\r\nGracias.",

            "content": "I don't mean to get deep and definitely not right off the bat, but it's pretty true that small events can change the course of your life whether you're aware or not and that is what Yojou-han Shinwa Taikei (or the 4.5 Tatami Mat Galaxy) is all about. Sure it's also about pleasing your Johnny, hijacking blimps, engaging in prank wars, being ripped off by fortune tellers, joining the local power ranger squad, and eating cats and castella, but that's all trivial. Brought to you by the same guy who brought you Mind Game, Cat Soup, and Kaiba, Masaaki Yuasa, brings you what I wouldlike to refer to as his best work yet.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nA nameless protagonist, referred to as Watashi ('I') by himself, has just entered college, and the story more or less follows his many lives and many misfortunes. Each episode starts with Watashi pursuing something inane or stupid - like a \"rose-colored campus life\" or \"raven-haired maidens\" and in each episode his friend Ozu, manages to somehow screw everything up. I say friend in the lightest sense of the term, because Ozu isn't really anyone's friend. He's a backstabbing punk who just loves to terrorize people, and he always manages to infect Watashi in one way or another, usually ending up driving him away from his goal. Along Watashi's trip across the Tatami Galaxy you're introduced to many different people, and in each life, a different story unfolds. Each story is unrelated other than by starting the same way at first glance, but you'll start noticing some patterns, and eventually it brings you to one of the most impressive endings I have ever seen. If I were to tag a genre to this anime I'd first have to say it's a slice-of-life comedy, then mystery, but it's also a really great psychological anime. It's incredibly dialogue heavy, and the first three minutes of episode one has the most text I've ever seen in an anime. That being said it can be very easy to lose track of what is going on, but if you're on your feet then you shouldn't get lost too easily.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nYojou-han is brought to you by MadHouse, which is known for it's diverse art style and in this anime's case it is either defined as pretentious or glorious. I would like to call it the latter. It's non-traditional and is unlike any other anime in existence, seriously. It's like Mononoke when Mononoke was new, it can amaze people, or turn people the heck away. It's a very vibrant anime, and everything is so fluid - movement looks just splendid. For those faint of eyes, be wary, Yojou-han Shinwa Taikei may not be the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nWell, there's a song about shapes in an early episode. That was like, totally freaking awesome. How many anime have songs about shapes? Unless Fullmetal Alchemist the Musical is coming out anytime soon, I think that's about a zero other than Yojou-han. The opening is amazing, and Asian Kung-Fu Generation does a great job (It's called \"Maigo Inu to Ame no Beat\"). I believe it's their first opening for a non-shonen show. The ending is amazingly well positioned (you'll see what I mean) and the first time you hear it I promise you'll get a small shiver. The singer is the same who sang the Arakawa Under the Bridge opening, Etsuko Yakushimaru. The voice acting for every character is of course, awesome as well. Watashi does most of the talking and I was considering favoriting his voice actor (Shintaro Asanuma) just because I liked to hear him talk. The background music is the only flaw sound-wise. There really isn't much to listen to, and even if their is, I probably didn't notice, because between following the dialogue and looking at the art, it's pretty hard to manage a third element.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI've already explained who Watashi is, but let me tell you a little more. Watashi likes shortcuts and doesn't like working, and almost can be seen as a lazy Ozu. Ozu is our antagonist most of the time. He's the downright rotten scoundrel who always leads our poor Watashi astray, and usually ends up profiting off of it. I called Watashi a \"lazy Ozu\" a moment ago because Watashi isn't an innocent little bird, he's just too lazy to put his efforts into anything other than his hobbies. Akashi, the somewhat romantic interest, is a girl who loathes moths and is bluntly cold to everyone around her. Kind of like Senjogahara (from Bakemonogatari), but easier to cope with. She's pretty funny herself, but all the characters are. We have the doll-fanatic Jougasaki, the drunk and elder Hanuki who likes to speak broken engrish, the Master Higuchi, who is an 8th year graduate who plans to travel the world, and multitudes of others (like Watashi's Johnny (see Eden of the East)). The character development is insanely good too. This anime is about Watashi's little foray of self realization, thusly he gets the most character development, but never have I seen it done so well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAn anime that can create a macrocosm within itself is an anime to be trifled with. It sets the stage with brilliant characters and visuals, brings hilarious moments throughout, and manages to deliver numerous meaningful messages. Is there a perfect world? Will I be happier with more money and women? Will I be happier doing what people say I should? Yeah. It's pretty damn complex. It's as thought provoking as Kaiba while bringing the comedy of Gintama. I think it's safe to leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nNo fanservice, no lolis, no moe, no ultra-violence, no regrets. It's intelligent without being snobby, it's stupid without being idiotic, and it's appealing without being inappropriate.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, I think you should just try it out. It's only 11 episodes, and I think for the one season range of anime, this is one of the best out there. \\n\\n\r\nDestiny is always dangling right in front of you, so why not reach out and grab this anime?",

In the span of each episode, our nameless main character (he is referred to as Watashi, basically meaning \"myself\") goes over the same two years of university, unaware of the loop, each time joining a different club, in search of a \"rose-coloured campus life\".\r\nYojouhan is a rare example of a series with time loops where the loops themselves are actually played with. Throughout the 11 episodes, there are several different stories, but many of the episodes focus on the same stories as others. Whatmakes these episodes work is that we see the stories from different angles. In some episodes, we see segments of the story that aren't entirely clear, though at the time are not distracting. In later episodes, these plot points are often explained when Watashi's perspective changes and we see what actually happened. The best part of this, though, is that every episode lends pieces to a larger story. While the series is episodic, what we see effectively falls into place like a jigsaw puzzle, all coming to fruition in the final episode making for one of the most satisfying conclusions I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result of this, the first few episodes of the series don't make complete sense. They come off as being more abstract than part of an actual plot, but as the series goes on the beginning is referred to in a way that makes this start a vital piece of the puzzle. However, the start is hardly a throwaway. While not as strong as the rest of the series upon viewing, the bizarre and abstract style make the beginning an enjoyable watch anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, the way the series is presented is part of the genius. Upon starting the show, the first thing that will strike you is undoubtedly the art. The characters are drawn in an oddly cartoony way, using only one-tone colours for the art and having a rubbery kind of movement to them. This seems like an odd choice, but it does help to draw you into the unique world of Yojouhan, and later in the story it even gets used for plot purposes. This is also combined with a lot of black and white live-action shots, wherein the characters are sometimes drawn over the actors.\\n\\n\r\nThe strange presentation doesn't stop there, though. One strange feature of Yojouhan is that Watashi is very fond of monologuing, in a way very reminiscent of Kyon (from the Haruhi Suzumiya series, in case you've been living under a rock). He does so, however, at a very high speed. If the show has a fault, it is this, but it's more of a double-edged sword than a flaw outright. For people who aren't great at reading, the high speed of the subtitles can often make the things Watashi says hard to keep up with, but it's rarely overwhelming. On the plus side of it, it helps to keep the pacing of Yojouhan fast, which keeps the series interesting, an important factor in a series that is driven with an abundance of dialogue (excellent though the dialogue may be).\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that could have easily been dull or just weird if it had been handled wrongly, it only makes sense that even more precautions are made to make sure that there isn't a dull second in Yojouhan, as evidenced by the motormouthed narration. What helps with this is that rather than being thrown into an entirely new plot every time, there are a few elements that remain the same throughout every story. The beginning and end of each episode are usually the same, as well as Watashi's meeting with a fortune teller. This helps the viewer to keep a pace with the series, which may have been otherwise hard to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Yojouhan aren't really the focus point, but they aren't an afterthought by any means. While each member of the cast is a vibrant and distinctive individual in of themselves, the actual characterisation isn't really the strong point of the characters, but rather how they are used. Just like the story, each character and their actions throughout the two years are explained slightly more with each new perspective. This ends with more or less every character coming out good, but one character in particular sticks out as being an excellent example of defied expectations, showing their nature as a 3-dimensional character as we see their story from each side fall into place. I won't spoil who it is, but anybody who has seen the series should know who I mean. Watashi himself, while an unremarkable person, is hard not to like for his enjoyable musings and relatable situations, and as the series goes on he does develop well, if not remarkably so.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the time loops persist for as long as Watashi continues to miss the proper way to live the two years, with conclusions that have been dangling in front of his eyes the whole time. Some of the conclusions become expected after a mere few episodes, but other, more important ones (as well as the entire point of the time loops) are less obvious and yet no less excellent.\\n\\n\r\nYojouhan Shinwa Taikei is an exercise in series structure unlike anything before it. The way the entire series is built comes off as nothing short of genius. I have yet to see any of acclaimed director Yuasa Masaki's previous works, but Yojouhan makes it blatantly clear that he lives up to the reputation that precedes him. I can only hope Kaiba, Kemonozume and Mind Game are nearly as good as this, because now Masaki has set an excellent example of how to make a truly great, original anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 10/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Bakemonogatari, Welcome to the N.H.K!",

            "content": "I think I'm not in the wrong here when I say most of us have probably thought of the best way to live life at one time or another. That can mean what you want to be when you grow up, your dreams, ambitions, goals, what path you want to take, and what you envision it ending up life.\r\nTatami Galaxy's unnamed protagonist is one concerned with exactly that. In seek of that ideal life, he desperately repeats the first 2 years of his college life , searching for the \"rose-colored campus life\", and the \"raven-haired maiden\" that supposedly awaits him.\r\nIn doing so, he is ableto realize the complexity of humans, himself, what he really wants, and what it means to live life. It's very clear that this show is leashed to a strong central theme from the start, as the episodes repeat themselves over and over to drive its point home, and make the cathartic end that it builds up to all the more resonant.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, I think it's probably director Masaaki Yuasa's best piece, or at least my favorite of his. This is a show that can flash through 3 or 4 art styles in just a few seconds. Vibrant, volatile, and ever-changing with the moods, the visual direction seems to me like a reflection of the volatility of life itself. Something's always on the screen there to catch your eye. The use of real life shots is funny, as this is probably one of the wackiest yet most relatable shows I have ever found myself watching. \\n\\n\r\nI see quite a few people that often say this show is \"deep\" or whatnot. Well, maybe. I don't really agree, actually. There's plenty of people out there that drop this show without getting to the end, and they do mark it off as a \"2deep4u\" show. Honestly, they might just be a little less intelligent than the rest of us, because the idea behind Tatami Galaxy seems to be something very simple to me. Stop caring about the best way to live life, because you WILL lose yourself in pursuit of that \"rose-colored campus life\". In fact, you may have already found that fulfilling life already, but haven't realized it. From there on, all you've got to do is enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\\n\r\n10/10.",

            "content": "I watched Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei back in 2011. I was a noob and thought it was a masterpiece and the best thing ever. Recently, I rewatched it and came to realize that it was just the wannabe-elitist in me thinking this show is any good. It's basically the same as Sword Art Online, just the other end of the same shit-stick. \r\nThe story of this series is identical to Endless Eight from Suzumiya Haruhi S02. Only this time it is apparently meaningful and deep and provokes some thoughts in people. All I see is yet another teenage drama aimed for people who are lost inlife, executed in style over substance manner so people who wouldn't like it could just be told they didn't get it. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to this being like SAO, instead of focusing on an overpowered gary-stu isekai jesus who gets all the bitches and is best at everything he does, Tatami Galaxy focuses on a man who is practicing escapism in a timeloop and dwelling on self-pity. The main difference is the comfort which has changed from \"it's all good now\" to \"pretty much everyone else fucked it up too.\" Same shit-stick, same level of escapism, other end. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the worst part of this show. They are such an empty shells it's almost as if the viewer is supposed to put their own personality and buddies + high school crush in these shells and act like this is me. This is so me. Just like Kirito and his harem. \\n\\n\r\nBack in 2011, I thought Yuusa Masaki was god. A gift to the anime industry. After seeing everything he has ever done, I can only call him a try-hard attempt of being the next Satoshi Kon. So try-hard even Netflix wanted to hire the guy. Speak of mainstream appeal. Also, I am pretty sure this series was created for western weebs in purpose of trolling. Why else would a male main character be called Watashi instead of Boku.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei to 15-20 year old audience, this will help you feel less shit about your past mistakes and deal with them. Make sure to never rewatch this, tho, you will/might only come to see what I am now seeing.",

            "content": "J. D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\" despite being a novel intended for adults, in many ways laid the groundworks for the typical young adult story, where an above average intelligent teen tells about their life and problems, in a very self-conscious, humorously wanna-be literate way. Examples range from the now aging Adrian Mole books, to mostly anything by John Green, and the recent British film \"Submarine\". Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, or Tatami Galaxy, is also a rendition of this trope, though seemingly with a pinch of some hallucinogenic drug.\r\nThe never named main character's story of university level loneliness, as it happens, is told withabnormally badly drawn characters, weird color use and bits of live action. Which might have been interesting under some circumstances, but only comes across as obnoxious combined with the vapid story carrying it all. Already from the first episode it's quite clear how Tatami Galaxy is going to end. The main character yearns for some imagined, idealized version of his university days while ignoring the attractive, very cool girl who is obviously into him, and depreciating the friends he does have. In other words, not something unhappy people can actually relate to, but an excuse for pretty much 10 episodes of the main character trying out different social environments, before he finally realizes his own stupidity. Of course, perhaps I'm wrong in taking it seriously, and all this might instead be an excuse for fun, but the humor is very repetitive. Not only because it's mostly the main character's constant, manic narration which really stops being amusing after an episode, never being particularly funny in the first place, but also because most of the silly situations and their two-dimensional characters are repeated in different ways, often leaving little room in each short episode for new things. Perhaps this is the reason it takes the main character so long to see the truth of his situation.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a single word, I believe, which describes this anime perfectly, and sufficiently, though I'm a bit reluctant to use it because a lot of people tend to bring it up whenever something is ambitious at all. This is fairly ungood, because I love animes, or pieces of any kind of media that try to do something out of the ordinary. Tatami Galaxy on the other hand, truly is \"pretentious\". With its fancy animation, aimless literary references, crazy symbolism, purposeful yet irritating repetitions, and what have you, it certainly presumes a lot about itself, wants to be seen as different and smart, only to end the banal way it was obvious it would from the beginning, having done nothing sensible in the meantime. Tatami Galaxy is truly a case of much style and no substance.",

            "content": "From time to time, I desire a show that will deliver a simple and grounded in reality plot in an unorthodox way with great success. Yes, you should already understand that Tatami Galaxy holds no need for superficial or amazing concepts to be successful, just a realistic story executed in a masterful way.\r\nStory : 10 / 10 \"Masterful\"\r\nTatami Galaxy is set on a fictional universe, specifically a town, which seems pretty close to the modern Japanese towns. Our main character, Watashi, expects to find the rose colored campus life that he always dreamed of, entering a campus club. Instead, he finds mischief and disappointment inevery way possible.  Every time he joins a club, everything seem to go wrong and he ends up regretting his choice, wanting to go back to the moment of choosing it and reset his life by changing his choice. The plot is following his different choices and the different lifes he lived after them. Watashi begins a journey of self-discovery, where the weight of his choices matters the most, becoming a matured young man who lives his life with unlimited freedom but also respect on every choice. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9.1 / 10 \"Great\"\\n\\n\r\nThe show uses a minimalistic style that combines cartoonish graphics with no shading with a lot of live action film segments used in for quick depiction of areas with lots of background detail. Seen as poor by many, the art of Tatami Galaxy is gravely underrated. It effectively depicts the themes of the show, taking a realistic approach on many problems that college students face in Japan. Furthermore, it becomes very interesting when adding the psychological symbolisms included in the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9 / 10 \"Great\"\\n\\n\r\nA testament to the superb voice acting could be that, even though Watashi's speech is faster than a bullet train, he still manages to keep the viewer in his toes with his smart (and funny) take on many different subjects and make him feel whatever emotion he emits. As for the soundtrack, it fits great with the theme and mood of the series, succesfully representing the constant changes in atmosphere, from the melancholic \"Youjou han to Castella to Watashi\" to the mysterious \"Kamotaketsunuminogami\" and powerfully liberating \"Yojouhan Ki Owari\" or \"Takasegawa\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9.3 / 10 \"Great\"\\n\\n\r\nFrom the bullet-speed monologues of Watashi to the stoic and spiritual presence of Higuchi, the cast is the recipe for instant success. Watashi is a young college dropout who never seizes to amaze with his sarcastic and dark but witty dialogues on everything he analyzes. He is the source of the dialogues and monologues in Tatami Galaxy, and his themes vary from social commentary to self - sarcasm of the highest caliber. Ozu is another college student, dark and devilish character, who constantly drags Watashi to troubles. However, he has some hidden aspects which make him intriguing and three-dimensional. Akashi, a college student in the engineering department, is an adorable female character, and Watashi's biggest love interest. Higuchi is a stoic, and full with dreams on exploring the globe, character who is still a college student, even though he ,by far, had exceeded the minimum years of studying there. He also has many hidden sides, which made him mysterious, spiritual and occasionally wise. There are more characters that are also very interesting, but doesn't quite measure up to the other mentioned above. However, there is not a single character that is not likeable in this series, because of his quirks and personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10 / 10 \"Masterful\"\\n\\n\r\nI fully enjoyed every minute of Watashi's attempts to reach a rose-colored campus life, his moments of self-discovery and liberation scenes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nVerdict : 9.5 / 10 \"Masterpiece\"\\n\\n\r\nWhen simple but meaningful premises meets innovative and unique storytelling methods, a show like Tatami Galaxy is born. Excluding or changing only one component of the Tatami Galaxy's recipe would result in losing it's eternal glowing. \\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing more boring than reading a review, so give yourself the chance to watch this exquisite show. You will not regret it.",

            "content": "Beware, spoiler-ish review.\r\nIt is a given that choices are very important for all of us, for just a minute of thought or two can change the outcome of many things in our lives, that be a relationship, that be a friendship, that be our well-being, anything I dare say. Before going to sleep, I personally reminisce of my actions, coming from my choices, which in turn come from my thoughts, and make a conclusion as of whether these actions were the right thing to do for myself. Ever thought of how much of a toll a choice can take in your life? Additionally, have youever thought of something depicting that matter of fact in a way that is both gripping, personal and goosebumps-inducing? That is what The Tatami Galaxy did to me. It touched me so much, I could relate to it in such a manner, that I now consider it my favorite anime series of all time, something that is irreplaceable for me. Coming from the hands of an insanely experienced director in Japanimation, who specialises in style over substance shows, Masaaki Yuasa, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is an expectional coming-of-age show like no other, which takes such an everyday, simple, common concept that everyone of us has given a glimpse of thought on, and unravels it through some of the most ingenious executions I have ever encountered in any work of fiction.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is about a college student without a name (shall be referred to as Watashi from now on), who is lonely and considers himself as one of the most unlucky people in the world. As he eats in a ramen stand named Neko Ramen, he stumbles upon a self-proclaimed god of martimony, who decides the pairings between men and women during the Kannazuki Festival in Izumo, his name being Higuchi Seitarou (or Kamotaketsunominokamo duh). Through a conversation he has with him, Watashi starts reminiscing of his past two years in college, through his misadventures with his only friend Ozu, with whom he spends time trying to break up couples in the college in the first episode, because he has nothing else to do, blaming Ozu for coming close to him and for ruining his life. By the way, Ozu looks like a ghoul, and that is of importance. Amongst the chaos, a love interest of Watashi's appears, Akashi, who is cold and introverted, yet shows some interest when it comes to Watashi. He tries confessing to her quite a lot of times throughout the series, all of them failing because of reasons. Other side characters are present as well, including an english-loving perverted dentist, a dude who has a doll fetish, the doll itself, a god of martimony as said earlier, the leader of the Secret Society Chinese Restaurant, the Cleanup Corps, a girl that Watashi exchanges letter with, etc. After Watashi fails on doing something, or even when he himself thinks that he did not leave up to his own expectations (due to not himself as he says, but due to other people and mainly Ozu), he goes back to the start of his college years, that indicated with the backdrop of a clock or, well, many clocks, and starts his college years with a different club, interchangeable events yet mostly the same people and him remembering some things from the other timelines as he experiences them in the timeline he is in, kinda like deja-vu.\\n\\n\r\nBefore moving on, I would like to clarify something. Please do not take the time travel plot device literally and in a realistic manner, because it is meant to be played with. Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is after all a surrealistic unorthodox anime series, so the plot device exists for a different reason than expected, and that is to present a really important message.       Consequently, each episode serves as a piece of the puzzle, all of them creating an allegory which is one of a kind. Yes, the entirety of The Tatami Galaxy serves as an allegory through the different timelines, which I would call metaphors, each of them including some basic and easy to understand symbols, examples being the mochiguman and the moths, which are utilized to the fullest. All that to answer a very simple concept, the one of life choices and their outcome. That is what this anime series does perfectly, it plays with its devices and creates a two-episode wrap up which is nothing short of a miracle for me personally, really. Simple metaphors, simple allegory, perfect everything.\\n\\n\r\nTo get on with the characters, Watashi shall be first. Watashi is that dude who has many expectations of his life and is very optimistic, him being the embodiment of before-coming-of-age idealism, and once he finds out that life is not that rose-coloured and that raven-haired maidens will not swarm before him, he starts blaming others and does not accept that he himself is looking too far ahead and that the world is not full of butterflies and flowers. It takes him quite some time to understand that he is the one at fault, and that he does not grab opportunities in order to be single-handedly happy. The most interesting part of Watashi would be his name indeed. Why is his name Watashi, which means \"I\"? That is because Watashi is open for self-insert. He is a character that us watchers can relate with really easily, not for just what he lives through, not by just understanding him and his flaws, but by adding ourselves in the story, with our own flaws, with our own character, with our own problems. After all, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is not a story itself, it tells a story, a story of Watashi and his coming-of-age, so why not adding yourself in turn and making it more relatable, productive and interesting? \\n\\n\r\nOzu is undoubtedly the most enigmatic figure of the whole series, presented as a black cupid, as the character who's connected with Watashi through the black thread of fate, as a curse in Watashi's eyes, as a ghoul. He indeed is a clever and troublesome creature, but he is one who admittedly would accept Watashi and who would always be close to him and help him, making his life adventurous in turn. Ozu is the person that Watashi must accept in order for him to come to terms with himself and try out a different approach in life, completely different from what he was trying to do all the time. An interesting thing about Ozu is his face. Why is he like a ghoul? The reasons might be plenty, but I somehow narrowed it out. Ozu might like that because that is how Watashi perceives him to be. Watashi believes that Ozu has an ugly soul, that he is a bad person that wants to make him suffer just to have fun, though of course that is not the case. To put it bluntly, Ozu's face is a personification of how Watashi feels about him in the start. That can be justified due to them swapping faces in the last seconds of the series, meaning that Ozu viewed Watashi as a black cupid then. \\n\\n\r\nAkashi is yet another interesting character in the Tatami Galaxy. She has a cold demeanor and does not express herself most of the times, but she seems more open when it comes to Watashi. Another reason is the thing that she is Watashi's love interest. Despite not appearing a lot in the series, as it mostly revolves around Watashi, it can be observed that she does care about him, and quite a lot at that. She is the observant type, and takes action in episode 8 as well, where she is asked to be the one Watashi exchanges letters with. Therefore, she is one that wants Watashi to develop and understand more things about what a happy life is and where it might lead. It is heavily hinted that by the end, Akashi ends up with Watashi, them going to Neko Ramen as he had promised in previous episodes, and him returning the Mochiguman to her. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters by all means defy certain archetypes, as they all are quite unique to say the least. A fellow with a doll fetish is always fun to watch, the three episode arc with Watashi and the three women being the most hilarious thing I have ever watched in animated form. The side characters mostly serve as means for Watashi to develop, as well as comedic elements, and successful ones at that. After all, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei has a large portion of dark comedy through Watashi's fast-paced monologues, which also serve as great social commentary and which, for the lack of a better term, are funny as heck. Many kinds of comedy are included in the story, including slapstick, which is successful as well, despite slapstick not working out in other series and being a complete miss. Johnny's usage throughout some episodes is also of significance as well, him being a metaphor to Watashi's sexual urges and worries. The scenes including Johnny teh Cowboi and his horse always were really funny, to the point of finding myself bursting out laughing without second notice.\\n\\n\r\nIn each different timeline, Watashi joins different clubs. In some others, the series does not focus on the clubs he has entered, but on his romance anxieties and interests. In episodes 1-3, he enters the Tennis, Film and Cycling associations, episode 4 is about the proxy wars and Watashi and Ozu's place in them, episode 5 goes back to the way episodes 1-3 were done with a Softball circle, and episodes 6-8 are about him joining some circles, but mostly about him and the three love interests of his, apart from Akashi (though Akashi is one of them in disguise but that is another matter). Episode 9 is about the mysterious Chinese Restaurant circle, and episodes 10-11 serve as the wrap-up of each and every episode of the series, Watashi coming into conclusions and realizations and completing his development and coming-of-age. With that being the case, you might think that the first 9 episodes are pointless, but that is in no way true. Letting alone that each and every episode has underlying and self-sufficient themes, examples being unrequited love, consumerism and the use of personality masks, what the first 9 episodes manage to do is building raw connection between the viewer and the main character, as well as something really fun and wacky to follow. It is a matter of fact that it is the journey that matters and that leads things into a conclusion which is not of as much importance as the journey itself after all. Trials and tribulations are made, but the conclusion is happy plus cathartic plus ambitious.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values work greatly, in a way that I can not imagine the series working out in another way when it comes to how it looks. The artstyle is really unique, really unorthodox, changes depending on the moods, is extremely detailed, vibrant and variable. It also adds to the comedy, because of the dumb faces and the funny reactions of our main character because of what he is going through. It is natural that it might turn someone off by its start, because it is an artstyle that is not that dominant in the medium, especially for the newcomers, but it is easy to get used to after one or two episodes, and it is even easier to realise how unique it is in a great way afterwards. The animation is also detailed, includes live-action shots and scenes to add to the realism of the concept, the movements feel natural and it is generally something great to watch and behold.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really strong as well, and about my favorite part in all the show is included here, that being the opening. The opening is so fun to listen to, it has some of the greatest background music I have ever set my ears on and, most importantly, the lyrics are godly. And they spoil the whole show. Such connection with lyrics of a song have I never shown aside from the Tatami Galaxy's opening. Its title is \"Maigoinu no Ame to Beat\", a title that fits incredibly well to the theme of the series, by Asian Kung-fu Generation, who never disappoint me with their work in opening songs. Their songs also include Boku Dake ga Inai Machi's opening, Re:Re:, which is the best part of the whole show. The ending song of Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is tremendously good as well, sang by one of my favorite and most unique singers in the japanimation medium, Etsuko Yakushimaru, who also sang the first opening of Mawaru Penguindrum, which is also godly. Fun and unique to listen to, her songs always impress. The OST is, by all means, goosebumps-inducing. I am amazed at how each song fits the scene it represents, and also going to give a round of applause to sound director plus the creator of the OST of the series, for making it as strongly present as it is throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly did I enjoy The Tatami Galaxy to the fullest. Having watched it many times, it is the piece that I feel is the one that was meant for me, it is like fate had its hand into my connection between me and the series, a masterpiece. It is nothing short of a masterpiece in my opinion. I laughed a lot, I cried a whole lot, I felt a connection I have never felt in any other kind of series, in any other kind of medium, it is nothing short of a miracle for me, this series. Thank you Yuasa, thank you for bestowing the anime industry and especially myself with such a present. Amazing, spectacular, cathartic, ambitious, goosebumps-inducing, emotional, hilarious, genuine. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLetting my bias aside, The Tatami Galaxy is a series that everyone should check out. Right off the bat, I am gonna decline it being called \"deep\". What is deep is the execution, not the anime itself in heart. On the inside, the Tatami Galaxy is human, it is so true that it hurts, it is so simple that everyone can understand it if he or her focuses on it just a bit. Simple yet complex. Over-the-top yet down-to-the-earth in its true form. That is what the Tatami Galaxy is. And it is nothing short of a work that should be considered a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nNote: Sorry for being biased. This review comes from the bottom of my heart, I hope you will understand where I am coming from. Thanks a lot for reading, it means much.",

            "content": "The idea of perfection is something that, I believe, not any piece of media has been able to attain, and that makes sense. Nothing is 'truly perfect' and every piece of media, no matter how great that product actually is, will still have flaws in one way or another and this philosophy also applies when I give tens to shows. When I do so, I don't reward an anime a ten because I believe it is perfect. I reward a ten to an anime that does the most good or is a shining example of what the medium is capable of. The Tatami Galaxy isone such example of this. A show that perfectly conveys the power of the medium and all of the limitless possibilities it contains, this show, despite the medium's tropes and cliches, still remains an anime unbound by genre convention and is oozing with so much creativity, charm and great writing that it has become my personal favourite anime of all time! A such, I apologise in advance if I sound like I'm being a little too biased throughout this review, but I absolutely adore this show! Everything from the characters to the narrative is handled with such care that it's hard to for me to even articulate properly into words, but, alas, I will god damn try! This, ladies and gentlemen, is The Tatami Galaxy in a 4.5 tatami mat nutshell: (pssst, only those who have seen the show will get the reference!)\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy has a rather unconventional narrative structure, which, at first, did put me off from even watching the show. The show stars a nameless protagonist, who attends college for the first time hoping, as he himself puts it, for a rose-coloured campus life. At the end of each episode, the clock goes back once again and essentially resets the whole episode, back to when the main character starts college once again. Each episode pretty much starts out in the same fashion but in every story, the main character joins a brand new club, meets new people and each episode is just a small segment in a much larger picture and narrative. In one episode, the show may begin one story thread which will be connected later on in another episode while, at the same time, systematically resolving older narrative threads established in previous episodes. Now, I'll admit, that it did take me time to accept this fact and structure, but thankfully each episode is vibrant enough and distinct enough to work by itself and the constant juxtaposition of endings and resolutions to each episode felt fresh, original and the entire show has a very addicting and fast-paced nature about it. There is always this lingering sense of desire to know what happens next and to fully understand this crazy world we have been pushed into and this is part of the fun of The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the appeal of this anime is trying to figure everything out as we watch more and more of the show leading up to the most satisfying conclusion I have ever seen in which everything gets brought together in such a neat and tidy way while also making complete sense at the same time. This sense of satisfaction is only enhanced on my repeated viewings of the show. The more and more times I watch The Tatami Galaxy, the more I am able to pick up on small details and thus, I appreciate the ending even more than I did the first time around. Not only that, but the show's pace, as mentioned before, is crazy. If you've ever seen the Bakemonogatari franchise in which its characters speak about five hundred lines a minute, then you already have an idea about the pace at which the Tatami Galaxy goes. The characters speak so fast in this show and dish out so much comedy and wit that it can be hard at times to keep up, but I believe this is one of its strengths. The insane pace and nature of the show mirrors real life too, and, in particular, how fast your college life will zoom by. As someone who has only two weeks of college left myself, this theme in particular, and the way the show is structured speaks volumes to me personally and is one of my favourite things about this show. \\n\\n\r\nPart of the anime's charm is in its wit, metaphorical line delivery and meaning. The entire script is loaded to the brim with clever jokes, play on words and the character interactions is by far the most entertaining aspect of this show. The internal monologues the main character has are both so funny and relatable to anybody wanting to fit in while attending school, that it's genuinely charming. The comedy is easily the strongest part of this show, and I believe it's a show that gets funnier the more you age and the more cynical you become. It invites you to laugh at the ridiculous situations everyone encounters in their day to day life and all of the clubs the main character joins each brings something new to the table and each has their own unique gags and jokes which never made the show feel as if it were repetitive. Complementing this story is a varied and likeable cast of characters, all of which are unique in terms of designs and personality. My personal favourite being Ozu, the main character's, sort of, friend out of circumstance who seems to be out just to make our protagonist's life a living nightmare. The fact that we never even learn the name of our protagonist just goes to show how well written this anime is since he is still so endearing and entertaining to watch on account of how relatable he is.\\n\\n\r\nDescribing The Tatami Galaxy is a rather difficult thing to do considering how experimental everything is and how it combines so many different genres together into one blender; it's a show that's best to be experienced by the viewer on their own. It has elements of being a love story, but not really. At the same time, it is also a coming of age story but presented through surrealism and comedy. What's great about the show is how all of these elements and genre staples never feel forced or intrusive on any other areas of the show. The show combines them all together and presents them in such a colourfully, creative way that it comes across as so charming and lovable while allowing each respective element time to develop. For example, the love story, despite being fragmented due to the nature of the show, has a genuine sense of progression during its run while also never feeling too overbearing or soppy. Adding to the wacky nature of the show is one of the most unique and vibrant art styles in the medium. Everything pops out at you and the visuals are wonderful, conveying the emotions of the characters in interesting ways. My favourite being the scenes in which the main character speaks to his penis, who he calls 'Johnny'. 'Johnny' is presented as a cowboy on a horse and this makes for some very creative and very funny comedy, and the whole show is like this! The music is also superb, and I LOVE the ending and opening tracks! Two of my favourite pieces of music in the entire medium. The show has a very distinct art style which is oozing with style, creativity and colour, and much of it feels very much like a pop-art piece of art. The animation and art style is endless imaginative which brings this vibrant world to life; it feels very postmodern and experimental, but, in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as I said in the opening paragraph, nothing is truly perfect, and this also applies to The Tatami Galaxy. There were a few moments that I felt were kind of weak and some moments that were just straight out boring, in particular episode ten. In addition, watching the show can also be highly tiring due to the fast nature of the show, but these elements were few and far in between and everything I have praised makes up for it. The Tatami Galaxy is a strange show but one brimming with personality, fantastic dialogue and a great cast of characters. It fully shows us what the medium is capable of and is by far, one of the greatest anime out there. It also goes to show that an anime doesn't have to have a complicated narrative or be buried underneath deep and thought provoking themes. If anything, this series plays it rather safe with its themes and narrative thematics. It's a series that, while certainly not everyone will like, anyone can understand after their initial watch of the series. And that, is one of the reasons why I love this show so much. Madhouse proves once again why they're one of the best anime studios out there and I wish them all the luck on future projects in the future. I would highly recommend this show (if it weren't obvious at this point). As a final side note as well, the series has finally been licensed and as such, I decided to go ahead and purchase the collector's edition, which has a ton of awesome posters, making-of books and title cards. If you're a big fan of the series yourself, I would highly recommend buying this too!",

The narrator speaks in a very very fast manner, making a lot of his narration unintelligible. Even with the subtitles on, it was very difficult to follow. I thought after a few episodes I would adapt to the pace, but unfortunately it did not happen. \r\nMy second problem with this anime was the amount of repetition. As the protagonist relives some of his days with a difference going from slight to more pronounced. But I grew tiredof this rather quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe third problem was the visuals : some may like the color palette, or the character design which I can only describe as minimalist. It is a matter of personal preference, but I did not dislike it. I HATED it. To me, it felt cheap. I would not recommend it, even though I understand why some may like it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "There isn\u2019t much to Tatami Galaxy. A nameless protagonist, here by referred to as Watashi, wants another chance at a \u201crose colored campus life with a raven haired maiden\u201d. Through mystical means he is granted the opportunity to do so, thus beginning his journey for that rose colored campus life he so desperately wants though it might just be right in front of him. With such a setup there are not many places to go, and Tatami Galaxy quickly finds itself trapped. \r\n Most episodes follow the same structure of Watashi joining a club in order to reach his goal and falling justshort of it due to his \"friend\" Ozu\u2019s schemes. In his defeats Watashi gets closer and closer to asking out his main love interest Akashi but fails to do so and the cycle starts again. Throughout the series Watashi fails to pursue many different opportunities which can become quite tiresome. Granted, that\u2019s the point of the story but taking the \u201cget in the damn robot\u201d scene from Evangelion and stretching it out into an entire series is arguably not a good idea to begin with. When a story presents its ending in the first episode it becomes even more reliant on the journey there to be fulfilling or subvert expectations. Tatami Galaxy manages to do neither and instead we get eleven frustrating episodes of silly misadventures and while some of it can be entertaining it is mostly just pointless and meandering, ultimately adding nothing to the forgone conclusion.\\n\\n\r\n Tatami Galaxy desperately tries to be quirky and relatable to the point where it's off putting. Within the first five minutes of Tatami Galaxy we have obnoxiously fast narrations where the main character just complains about his life, a man with a huge chin slurping down noodles, and some fucker that looks like an onion. It\u2019s a lot to take in right from the start, and anyone who doesn\u2019t see the humor in the spastic and hyper active style Tatami Galaxy offers is in for a very long ride.  \\n\\n\r\n The attempts at making the characters relatable just makes them unlikable. The protagonist is a nameless college student who is completely average, filled with regrets, and in general is lost when it comes to life and love. Aren't we all. Despite the eye rolling lack of subtly the story manages to even mess that up as the main character is more like that one friend who has a personal problem where everyone else knows the solution but he just keeps bitching about not knowing what to do despite being told over and over again. It is unflattering in real life and not any better here unless you like cheap self inserts instead of characters.  \\n\\n\r\n The rest of the characters are just as irritating and why Watashi is even friends with some of these people is beyond me. Ozu fucks him over on a constant basis and seems to be actively working against him. Higuchi is some hipster who likes to hang out with younger kids for some reason. Hanuki is a cock tease who Watashi is too much of an... anime character to fuck her even when she isn't being a cock tease  and is throwing pussy at him. Akashi isn\u2019t much better as they try to portray her as the witty \u201cnot like the other girls\u201d type of character one would see in a bad indie romantic comedy but she ends up coming off as just kind of cunty. In fact, the whole series in general just reminds me of a more arthouse version of a bad romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\n The only thing I got out of Tatami Galaxy that was a unique experience was being fairly annoyed despite not feeling incredibly passionate about the show in either a bad or good way. When a story amounts to \u201csad guy goes back to college\u201d with the most painfully obvious ending possible there has to be more than just quirky bullshit, Sword Art Online tier pandering, and clich\u00e9 messages about life that any well-adjusted person already knows. Unfortunately for Tatami Galaxy there isn\u2019t anything more and it ends up empty, leaving me yelling \u201cGet in the damn dentist, Watashi!\u201d.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nThere\u2019s no such thing as a perfect anime; everybody knows that. Due to the fact that different human beings value very different things across all mediums of art, it is impossible to create a work that everybody will agree is flawless. However, there IS such a thing as an anime that could not possibly be more effective in the delivery of its narrative, characters, animation, themes, and soundtrack under the given circumstances; an anime that is as close to perfect as you can possibly get. That anime is called The Tatami Galaxy. There is little debate among those who have indulged in thisbrilliant creation that The Tatami Galaxy is an absolute masterpiece. It\u2019s the hardest anime to criticize simply because it\u2019s thematically bulletproof; the only possible criticisms that can be made of it boil down to personal preference and what YOU may or may not be partial to on a subjective level.  Now, if all that is true, why has barely anyone seen this show? If it was THAT great, why isn\u2019t it overwhelmingly popular? Well, the answer to that question supremely unjust, but unfortunately true: The Tatami Galaxy is very experimental. The reason you may not have even heard of this little gem before is because not everyone is going to be into its one-of-a-kind style or use of literary devices. However, even if you aren\u2019t fond of its art direction or narrative presentation, it\u2019s hard to refute that this is one of the greatest anime ever made. It accomplishes everything it ever set out to do with the utmost of ease and grace. It sets ambitious and perhaps unreasonable goals and then proceeds to effortlessly meet them. Presenting the most horrifyingly under-watched anime in history: The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: A college dropout stops for a late night meal at his favorite ramen stand. There, he crosses paths with the self-proclaimed \u201cgod of matrimony\u201d. This bizarre meeting sends the young man hurtling through a horrifying flashback to his not-so-glorious college days as he is forced to reflect upon where it all went wrong for him.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy\u2019s plot is essentially a far better written and much artsier version the movie Groundhog Day; the protagonist is forced to relive his college days over and over and over again, with each iteration ending in his complete and utter misery. However, in addition to providing the same level of comedy, this anime also manages to be overwhelmingly meaningful, brutally thought provoking, and nihilistically sobering. The Tatami Galaxy may seem like an innocent comedy with a fancy art style up until the last couple episodes, but make no mistake; this anime has so much explicit detail to it that it\u2019s almost scary. It can only be described an absolute bombardment of symbols, themes, motifs, and imagery that you likely didn\u2019t even notice until the final episodes, if you noticed it at all. For that reason, it is essentially mandatory to rewatch this show in order to truly get everything out of it, because you WILL be overwhelmed. It\u2019s supposed to feel that way.\\n\\n\r\nBut what EXACTLY is this show about? Well, it\u2019s about a lot of things. Namely, it\u2019s about having respect for the choices you have made in your life and understanding the you need to take the good with the bad; there is no perfect, fairy-tale life style out there waiting for you. The message of this show is relatable to virtually everyone, but especially so for college students, considering that a university campus is the setting of The Tatami Galaxy. There are so many people out there who feel like they have lost their way or don\u2019t know what they are doing with their life, stressing out over every single situation, agonizing over the fact that they can never achieve the \u201crose-colored\u201d life they are so desperate to experience. Put simply, this is the story of man who is finding his way in life and discovering what it truly is to be happy. It\u2019s both a charming, heart-warming tale and a realist\u2019s harsh reality complete with the ups and downs that everyone can relate to. That\u2019s why everyone should watch it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you HAD to put The Tatami Galaxy into a genre, it\u2019s honestly closest to a comedy. Now, with that in mind, everybody knows that the most important aspect of a comedy (besides, well\u2026 the comedy) is the cast of characters. This puts The Tatami Galaxy in an interesting predicament, because its characters don\u2019t serve nearly the same roles that they might serve in a more traditional comedy. Rather, the characters in this show are all symbols. Our protagonist, for example, doesn\u2019t even have a name. The novel that this anime is based on (as in a REAL novel, not a light or visual novel) simply refers to him as \u201cWatashi\u201d, which makes the symbolism quite obvious. The rest of the cast, including Watashi\u2019s love interest Akashi and his best friend Ozu are also allegorical, but I won\u2019t go into detail on the subject for the sake of time and spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes The Tatami Galaxy\u2019s characters so masterful is that not only do they execute their symbolic roles so masterfully, they also manage to have likable, charming personalities and add a lot of comedy to the show. While Watashi is without a doubt the most prominent and dynamic character, the side characters serve a purpose that is just as important: an emotional anchor. From episode to episode, seemingly everything around Watashi (i.e the eyes of the viewer) changes. His environment, his mental state, his hobbies, his pastimes, etc. all fluctuate superfluously, which can get chaotic. The only things we have as an audience to anchor us to reality, as in the only things that seem to NOT change episodically, are the side characters. Jougasaki\u2019s eccentricities, Akashi\u2019s hilarious fear of moths, and of course: Johnny. All of them serve as the only constants in an ever-changing world, and this technique was executed to perfection. By the end of the show, you feel like you personally know each and every character, particularly Watashi. Dare I say that you may feel as if you know him as well as you know yourself? In short, everything about this cast amazing; I can\u2019t picture them being done any better.\\n\\n\r\nThe last wave of praise that I must pile upon this masterpiece is in regards to its one of a kind presentation. In terms of animation, there is NOTHING out there that\u2019s even remotely comparable to The Tatami Galaxy. Not only does it use a wide variety of techniques, (including rotoscoping, which is seldom scene in the medium), it gets the absolute most out of them and creates a visually stunning product that you will never forget. Masaaki Yuasa is an absolute GENIUS. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING about this show\u2019s visuals are flawlessly executed. Not only does it look good, it\u2019s extremely fluent and meaningful. The Tatami Galaxy is perhaps the best example we\u2019ve ever seen of visual storytelling and using animation to convey meaning without words, and that\u2019s saying quite a lot. As for the soundtrack, I couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more fitting. From jazz to soft rock to tracks that simply transcend genres, the OST never fails to set the mood, whether it be depression, hope, happiness, or anything else. Have I mentioned that both the OP and ED sequences are superbly directed and consist of fantastic songs in general? On a final note, I must point out that Shintaro Asanuma delivered what I consider to be one of the most impressive voice acting performances of all time as the character of Watashi. The speed, clarity, and tone in which he speaks is so alluring and impressive, which merely contributes to this show\u2019s overall top-notch ability to present its story.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, watch the Tatami Galaxy. You owe it to yourself as a fan of anime to witness arguably the premiere model of what the medium is truly capable of. It\u2019s not for everyone, you might not love the art style, and you may not understand it the first time you watch it, but make no mistake: Those who are able and willing to digest the Tatami Galaxy will never forget it. The anime industry has never seen anything like it and it will never see anything like it again. This is without a doubt the finest example of how quality does not correlate with popularity. In case you take nothing else out of this review: WATCH. THIS. SHOW.",

            "content": "From the critically acclaimed director Masaaki Yuasa comes an anime that defies the definition of conventional: The Tatami Galaxy provides a ride full of twists and turns, rewinds and jumps through time. Beautifully crafted and imbued with a comedic touch, The Tatami Galaxy explodes with energy, ultimately forming a dense and complex narrative that serves as the embodiment of good directing. Indeed, The Tatami Galaxy proves that animation is a viable medium in terms of both storytelling and visual appeal.\r\n\tUpon first glance, what do you notice? Chances are it\u2019s the art style. Similar to Yuasa\u2019s previous works, The Tatami Galaxy features a unique, anomalous, butyet simple art style that never fails to evoke a sort of anger towards Yuasa among some anime fans, for many claim that they watch anime to get away from this very style; however, The Tatami Galaxy\u2019s art style reasserts the classic saying that less is indeed more. The style itself is brimming with simplicity; characters are bestowed with one shading at all times, only the most dominant features are depicted, while chins, ears, adam\u2019s apples, collarbones and other aspects of the body are forgotten, leaving the characters themselves appearing very flimsy, curvy and far from dynamic. \\n\\n\r\n\tHow, you may ask, does this advocate the fact that less is more? For those of you unaware of the mechanics behind the animation process, animators must draw a character numerous times, bearing the same proportions and details as the previous sketch. As a result of this, many animators spend their time copying over details from the preceding drawing rather than creating a sense of flow between them. On the contrary, The Tatami Galaxy\u2019s simple style allows the animators to portray actions more fluidly and regularly than other shows. The condensed style is much faster to draw, and so the animators are given a chance to work without restraint, and that is absolutely what they do. Characters ricochet across the screen, a plethora of objects move at once, still frames are very limited, and unlike many other anime, budget does not act as a confinement for imagination. \\n\\n\r\n\tI would also like to point out that, from a cinematic standpoint, this anime is incredibly well put together. Transitions between scenes flow brilliantly and scene composition is done with great expertise. I wouldn\u2019t be exaggerating if I said that The Tatami Galaxy is easily one of the most visually appealing works of animation that have ever graced this earth. \\n\\n\r\n\tDoes the theme of less being greater than more desist after moving away from the topic of art and animation? Well, not entirely. As the story progresses, or rather regresses, the characters are shown in varying situations that range from sad, hilarious to downright over the top. Rather than taking the time to elaborate as to what the character\u2019s roots are, the show uses its recursive nature to build the character\u2019s personalities and give them a good portion of depth. The characters themselves are all very likable and are drawn very smoothly. I especially enjoyed Ozu\u2019s antithetical antics and Akashi\u2019s icy yet affectionate attitude. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe stunning visuals are not the only thing The Tatami Galaxy has going for it; the voice actors pack great amounts of effort, emotion, and in some cases, speed, into their roles. The background music is also similar to the previously analysed categories in the sense that it follows the \u2018less is more\u2019 rule of the show. The Tatami Galaxy is at times silent, while at others calmingly quiet, but the rare fast-paced ensembles never fail to produce a sense of excitement and urgency in the viewer. The composer and sound directors working on this show deserve a great amount of kudos for their excellent work. \\n\\n\r\n\tLastly, I will assess the plot of The Tatami Galaxy. Ordinarily, I would deconstruct the plot of an anime first and foremost, but coincidentally, this is far from an ordinary anime. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe story follows its nameless protagonist as he searches for love. In an attempt to find his raven-haired goddess and attain the rose-colored campus life he had been dreaming of, he joins a multitude of extra-curricular activities, but the majority of his efforts are for naught. He denies the reality that has been set out before him, and time rewinds back to the day he first joined college, only giving him yet another opportunity to follow one of the endless contingencies awaiting him.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe plot gives the viewer room to guess what\u2019s going on \u2013 it allows them to speculate why time resets, how each individual episode correlate with one another, and the nature of the protagonist\u2019s recursive campus life, or to even ponder the possibility of no recursion at all. Rather than taking the viewer for a ride, The Tatami Galaxy lets the viewer create their own ride, then continues to enhance said ride into a rollercoaster. \\n\\n\r\n\tOverall, The Tatami Galaxy is a brilliantly put together anime brimming with creativity and originality. Like its predecessors, The Tatami Galaxy is filled with Yuasa\u2019s postmodern madness and humor, giving the viewer food for thought and a good laugh at the same time. I\u2019m usually very hesitant to give an anime, or anything in particular, the title of a masterpiece, but I believe that this show deserves no less than that. It is for that reason that I give The Tatami Galaxy all 10s across the board.\\n",

            "content": "This analytical review of The Tatami Galaxy spoils the entirety of the series and is thus advised for those who have completed the series.\r\nNotes: \r\n-The protagonist shall be referred to as Watashi.\r\n-The Tatami Galaxy shall be abbreviated as TTG.\r\nEpisode summaries:\r\nEpisode numbers will be referenced frequently in this review, so for the sake of easy reference, the episodes will be described briefly\r\nEpisode 1: Parallel world setup, romance setup, Mochiguman setup, suspense of why Ozu was chased by a mob at the end of the episode.\r\nEpisode 2: Watashi's movies; sabotaging Jogasaki;  Akashi asking that Watashi make his dream movie about true love between those tied byfate, unbounded by even gender come true. \\n\r\nEpisode 3: Watashi training for the birdman, how it contributed to his downfall, Icarus allusion,  Higuchi winning with Watashi's bike. \\n\r\nEpisode 4: Prank episode between Jogasaki and Higuchi, money that Watashi obtained to buy the tortoise toothbrush placed by the final Watashi from the tatami room.\\n\r\nEpisode 5: Watashi's pitfall in seeking health food and it actually making him more unhealthy,  tie to Ozu stealing the blimp, final Watashi appearing in front of current Watashi at the end.\\n\r\nEpisode 6-8: Choosing between three women arc.\\n\r\nEpisode 9: Ozu's romantic desires revealed, Watashi's slump in pursuing absolute pleasure.\\n\r\nEpisode 10: Tatami Room; parallel worlds reveal.  \\n\r\nEpisode 11: final message and conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nRefresher  terms:\\n\r\nMochiguman: Akashi's plush toy constantly dangling as an opportunity for Watashi.\\n\r\nCastella: The cake Watashi is seen eating on his own various times.\\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of a great, simple story lies in the technicalities: symbolism, subtleties, narrative ties and novel storytelling methods. As a great story is one that requires effort to craft,  paying heed to all the little details  is the push a simple story needs to match a well-done story with more complexity. The Tatami Galaxy (TTG)  is a great example of a simple story done quite well, with symbolism to pick apart, narratives ties to sort through, and well handling of its ideas.\\n\\n\r\nTTG's story is built upon contrivances, namely a time loop format, every episode a discrete loop serving for the sake of the final message. For some, these contrivances could be accused of either being inappropriate or lazy for such a simple story. However, to dismiss the series for its approach would be erroneously dogmatic when investigating the story's execution. We must instead examine how well it lived up to the type of story it tried to be.\\n\\n\r\nFor Tatami Galaxy's premise to reach its potential, I propose that it would need to do the following:\\n\\n\r\n1. Showcase the various facets through which the rose-colored campus life can be sought and the pitfalls of these approaches.\\n\r\n2. Provide a concluding message regarding the pursuit of the rose-colored campus life.\\n\r\n3. Reveal more about the characters by examining them through different scenarios, sides, angles.\\n\r\n4. Display how the various scenarios are related together, since the parallel universes are different sides of the same reality.\\n\r\n5. Remain engaging, fresh, and varied despite the repetitive nature\\n\r\n6. Establish foreshadowing and suspense to reveal the mechanics of the \"resets\" and its final message.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this analysis, we shall conclude how well TTG fits into these criteria.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the presentation is done well: the character designs are varied and expressive, Watashi's lightning fast monologues help give the show identity, and the visuals are pleasing. Most importantly, it effectively utilizes symbolism and recurring elements. The changing and varied colors help signify how each of the different worlds has its own color, though none are rose-colored. The repetition of the fortune-teller gag provides the viewer with something to anticipate; one will always be wondering when and how the fortune-teller is brought up. The clock symbolism is an effective motif to wrap up an episode and to maintain interest for the next one. Seeing the various ways Ozu is portrayed or introduced, and the visual representation he's given (being portrayed as a devil to mirror Watashi's perception of him) is a nice touch for engagement. The Mochiguman serves as consistent build-up to the climax. Even something minor such as the song Higuchi sings in episode 5 leads to the overall message of the story, through the line \"Search for the circle, to learn how to not become a circle.\" The castella is meant to be shared, yet Watashi always eats it, portraying his isolation; poignant when Watashi consumes it excessively in the final episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAn interesting motif of note is the moth. At first glance, it would seem the moths serve only to characterize Akashi, but their presence in Watashi's room suggests greater relevance. Moths are an antithetical motif to butterflies\u2014diametrically opposed to the butterfly effect is the eminent idea that vastly different events lead yet to one end. Throughout the different episodes, we get those various recurring elements, and Watashi's faliure to achieve the rose-colored campus life is present in each of them.  Higuchi claiming victory in the episode 3 and 4 bike races regardless of Watashi's presence further supports this reverse butterfly effect.  One can also read the moths as representing pitiful creatures, trapped by their tendency to flock to a light source, thus meeting a tragic fate akin to Icarus, whom the series references in episode 3. One can further read how their connection to  metamorphosis is intertwined with their role in freeing Watashi from the Tatami Room. But I shall not dwell upon these routes of analysis, as I cannot do them justice. \\n\\n\r\nNow, let us examine the structure of TTG, and how it's used for both foreshadowing and narrative ties. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 introduces us to the initiation of the alternate scenarios and of Watashi's promise to Akashi. It also builds suspense through the peculiarity of what happens to Ozu at the end of the episode, especially notable in how it ties to what's revealed about Ozu at the end of the series.  Episode 2 uses  Watashi's film failures to foreshadow events in future episodes: the first movie to the episode 4 prank battle, the second to the wavering between three women arc, the third to the tatami room trap and the final to Watashi and Ozu's pseudo-romantic scene\u2014never narratively integral but always welcome as foreshadowing.\\n\\n\r\nOther foreshadowing aspects include the fortune-teller's statement that opportunity is dangling in front of Watashi, referring to the dangling Mochiguman that he's unable to take hold of until the very end. The opening and ending also hint at being trapped in the tatami rooms. There's always a sense of mystery and suspense regarding the nature of the alternate scenarios. Parallel reality is foreshadowed cleverly when the episodes 9 to 11 Watashi enters the episode 5 ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe series utilizes far more of these narrative ties, to a level few shows do:\\n\\n\r\n-How Ozu's circumstance in the ending of episode 1  ties to Ozu's stealing the blimp in episode 5, and to Ozu's true intentions revealed in episode 9. In the final episode, these narrative ties serve to grant context to what exactly happened in the ending of the first episode. \\n\r\n-How the final Watashi's gathering money in the tatami galaxy provided an explanation for how the Watashi in episode 4 obtained the money for the tortoise toothbrush.\\n\r\n-How episode 4 hinted at Hanuki learning English, how we learn aspects of her relationship with Higuchi throughout the episodes, and how episode 4 hints at Higuchi's desire to depart. \\n\r\n-How episode 2 introduces us to the love doll interest of Jogasaki for the three women arc.\\n\r\n-How Watashi's dream movie in episode 2 (about true love escaping position, age, and even gender) hints at Watashi and Ozu appearing in a pseudo-romantic scenario at the climax of the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nYet another touch worth noting is that  the reversing of orders for the opening and ending themes in the final episode parallels the role reversal between Watashi and Ozu at the very end of the series; Watashi becomes the dominant one while Ozu becomes hesitant. \\n\\n\r\nNow we shall move onto how the series conveys its themes. While episodes 1 and 2 serve as the introduction and episodes 10 and 11 serve as the conclusion, the middle of the series aims to explore different approaches of the rose-colored campus life. Episode 3 demonstrates the pitfall of Watashi working too hard to fly the birdman. He seeks happiness, but as the Icarus allusion suggests, he fails by soaring too high;  to work too hard to seek the rose-colored campus life is itself a folly. This is the most effective commentary of the middle episodes because it ties directly to the ending that suggests one must embrace the life one has rather than trying too hard to look for something greater. Episode 4 serves as a reflection moment of Watashi simply goofing around, and how even that can contribute to a satisfying life. Episode 5 demonstrates how the pursuit of convenience can lead to a burden, through the health food story. Episode 6-8 comment on the pitfall of focusing on too many pursuits at the same time. Episode 9 displays Watashi's attempts to fully embrace hedonism and disobey moral standards in an attempt to gain satisfaction. \\n\\n\r\nAll these approaches are proven to be ineffective, and the true solution the series posits is to embrace the life one currently has. None of the realities may be rose-colored, but each at least has a color, each has value that can be appreciated. \\n\\n\r\nThe final episode also accomplishes two more things of note. Firstly, it provides catharsis as Watashi runs over to Ozu. We see glimpses of all the Watashis from the various realities call out to Ozu, and coupled with the soundtrack makes for quite a satisfying scene. Secondly, it raises the idea that  individuals can appear more multi-faceted when approached from different angles. The quirks we see of the characters throughout the different parallel worlds scenarios provide us more context into who the characters truly are, rather than what they seem to be at a first glance. \\n\\n\r\nFrom an entertainment standpoint, TTG manages to keep the series engaging despite the repetitive nature of repeating the same scenarios. Although the motifs are recurring, they serve the purpose of interest and familiarity. TTG maintains freshness through different scenarios, commenting on various ideas while disclosing different information.Even the three episode women arc which directly repeated the same scenario three times knew how to spread out information for variety. For example, we didn't see the context for Jogasaki's and Watashi's drinking contest in the first episode of the arc, but it was revealed in the second. We also didn't get context into the pen pal woman until the final episode. Each of those three episodes revealed new information and different angles to that same scenario, thus preventing complete repetition.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these elements of praise for the Tatami Galaxy, there certainly is room for criticism. Firstly, although the middle episodes each had at least decent commentary, only the thematic commentary of episode 3 was particularly great. Episode 4's commentary on reflecting over doing nothing of value could have been interchanged with any other scenario; it worked, but wasn't a distinct story for that idea.  Episode 5's thematic commentary is of some merit, but the message of the folly of seeking trying too hard for conveinece isn't far from episode 3's message. \\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 6-8 presented the pitfalls of seeking too many pursuits at once, but the idea could have been better if it focused on Watashi following more concrete ambitions, such as being divided between different hobbies or interests (which was the backdrop). This is primarily favorable to prevent the need of three episodes for that matter; not to mention the comedic effect of the \"Jhonny\" bits doesn't last for that long. Episode 7 was questionable since Watashi's obsession with the love doll is far too exaggerated for his character, and said obsession contributes nothing thematically to the series. Episode 9's pursuit on hedonism was fine enough, but it's more of small detail and isn't as thought-provoking or relevant to the final message of the show as episode 3's Icarus allusion.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the characters have   nice touches and quirks here and there, the concept in the final episode of \"people being deep if viewed from different angles\" required more fleshing out of the characters. Throughout the episodes, Watashi is exaggerated and serves whatever role or characteristic he's needed for:  resolving to sabotage Jogasaki in episode 2,  an extreme ambition to improve in episode 3, and  a questionable obsession with the love doll in episode 7.His volatility can be in part excused by there being parallel versions, each mildly different from each other but parts of the true Watashi. Regardless, it hinders the portrayal of a coherent character who can be characterized throughout the story. Akashi is given sufficient quirks with her seclusion and her fear of moths, but her interest in Watashi throughout all the episodes is a little too contrived and questionable. Jogasaki is given the lovedoll quirk, which adds slightly to his character, but doesn't grant us much more from the arrogant individual he normally is. He's still his arrogant self; we  for example don't see the nuance of given vulnerabilities given particular stimuli. Higuchi works well for his role. Though portrayed as wise, he isn't wholly responsible.\\n\\n\r\nOzu is a fan favorite mainly because he seems to just get in the way but is revealed to have motivations of his own.  However, the way this portrayal was executed in the series was the issue. While Ozu is revealed to be involved in more than stifling Watashi, he is too fated and intertwined with Watashi in the middle episodes. A prime example is his stalking of Watashi with the letter inference in the three women arc. Going through such lengths would be uncharacteristic given his revealed personal interests.  More questionable is Ozu's personality change into docility at the end of the show, which differs from all the other realities. This sudden dissonance can however be symbolically  justified  as either a consequence of his cutting his thread of fate with Watashi in episode 9 or his true nature outside of Watashi's delusions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother minor gripe with the series is information that suggests the incorporation of time resets when the series uses parallel realities instead. While Watashi questioning whether he had relived certain scenarios throughout the middle episodes aims for suspense, it actually implies a time reset, thus conflicting with the parallel realities reveal.  The clock symbolism at the end of each episode, though it's a strong visual cue, also has the same problem. Both of these fulfill their purpose in terms of engagement, but the red-herring it results in is a problem, albeit a minor one.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we may inspect those aforementioned criteria to see how well the Tatami Galaxy fulfilled its premise. \\n\r\n1.It did feature commentary on various approaches to the rose-colored campus life, though many of those episodes could have been handled better. \\n\r\n2. It did provide a fulfilling concluding message that worked well with the usage of various colors to portray the colors of different lives. This could have been a more nuanced message, but was satisfying enough.\\n\r\n3. It did show us characters from different angles through different scenarios, but there was room for much more with them.\\n\r\n4. It did a phenomenal job at narrative ties and spreading out information throughout the episodes that could be connected throughout.\\n\r\n5.The series almost always remained fresh and varied with all its stylistic choices and apt ability to spread out information across episodes.\\n\r\n6. The series also did a phenomenal job with all those foreshadowing aspects and building up suspense.\\n\\n\r\nOne can see that the series did an exceptional job with (4) and (6), a great job with (5), a good job with (2), and an acceptable job with (1) and (3). As such, TTG had overall great execution of the premise it set out to explore. Consequently, dismissing it based on the contrivance of the premise is unfair. In addition to meeting these criteria, the series did an exceptional job at utilizing its symbolism throughout.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: \\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is indeed an example of a simple series executed really well. Although it had certain issues with the characters or  story mechanics and had room for improvement with the thematic commentary, it accomplished so much with its symbolism, foreshadowing, and narrative ties that it easily makes up for it. Through its technical mastery of the little details, TTG is a great, accessible, well-made work and is a hallmark of the medium.",

            "content": "When you look back on your life up until now, do you find yourself feeling somewhat dissatisfied with how things have turned out? Do you find yourself regretting choices you\u2019ve made, the people you\u2019ve met and end up wishing you could just give it another shot, knowing that this time around, everything would work out so much better for you?\r\n If you are just such a person, then watching Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei -or The Tatami Galaxy as it has come to be known in English- is one opportunity that you simply can't afford to pass up.\r\n The story of a nameless (referred to as 'Watashi')young man in his third year at Kyoto University, looking back on the numerous adventures, expeditions and escapades he has experienced during his time on campus. However, rather than fond memories, he finds himself feeling rather dissatisfied with the way things have turned out, and proceeds to ask himself where things started to go wrong.\\n\\n\r\n Perhaps it was the club he joined. Maybe he made a few bad decisions along the way. But in all likelihood, it was all Ozu's doing. But it doesn't really matter who is at fault. With his opportunity missed, Watashi has no choice but to harbour his bitterness and day dream about how things could have been so very different...\\n\\n\r\n And then something miraculous happens, and Watashi is given something that you and I will never have; a second chance. The perfect opportunity to go back to the beginning. The opportunity to do it all again, to avoid his previous mistakes and ensure himself a life of happiness. But one simple question still remains; which path should he take? Which of the various roads, streets and avenues is the one that leads to that most glorious of gardens, the rose-coloured campus life? \\n\\n\r\n Unsurprisingly for a character who's name essentially translates as 'I', Watashi is a character that is easy to identify with; after all, 'disappointment' does not discriminate based on sex, race or class, and at the end of the day we are all looking for the same thing Watashi is-- our own happiness.\\n\\n\r\n But he is just one of the many interesting characters in the Yojouhan universe- there's Watashi's quote-unquote friend Ozu, who seems to be set on preventing Watashi from enjoying a care-free existence. There's Master Higuchi, a local god engaged in a bitter \"war\" with the leader of the film circle. Last but not least there is Watashi's underclassman Akashi, who's charmingly cute appearance, sets the hearts of men flying, shortly before her distant and fiery attitude brings them crashing back down to earth like Icarus.\\n\\n\r\n But Yojouhan's most impressive achievement is its beautiful, understated visuals. Despite integrating features like stylised photography and simplified character designs, Yojouhan never feels like a Director's visual experiment, but a seamless, straightforward production; proving that looking good doesn't always mean you need to show off. Of course, the animation and directing is still top notch, as you would expect from a show that takes this much pride in its art.\\n\\n\r\n The soundtrack, while certainly not below average, is the only thing about Yojouhan that can adequately be referred to as a weakness. The background music -quiet pianos and melancholic violins- certainly do their job, but fail to be impressive. This is a little disappointing when compared with other aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\n The opening and ending themes do offer some condolences though, with a particularly catchy opener 'Maigoinu to Ame no Beat' by Asian Kung-Fu Generation features grungy guitars and lyrics about the banality of everyday life yet has a subtle optimism about it which feels perfect for Yojouhan. Meanwhile, the ending sequence combines an atmospheric trance song with some mesmerising visuals.\\n\\n\r\n Then there's the dialogue, set to the kind of pace one would normally expect in an auction-house. Long and complicated sentences that begin and end within the confines of a single breath. While it makes reading the subtitles a little bit of challenge at first, the extra effort is worth it, as it makes the dialogue far more interesting, and is just one of the many things that demonstrate the level of attention to detail in Yojouhan.\\n\\n\r\n Offering an interesting storyline and considerably more depth than the typical 'Slice-of-Life' anime and each episode offers something new and original, without ever having to rely on tired clich\u00e9s like hot spring or beach episodes. It gives the whole show a remarkable freshness, and every episode is a pleasure to watch. And best of all it, it manages to be so much more than just straight up entertainment- it actually has a point behind it all. It leaves you with something to think about, and without resorting to emotional blackmail.\\n\\n\r\n Whether you're an expert or a beginner, a casual or critic, watching Tatami Galaxy is the perfect choice for a few hours of quality entertainment. Anime this good only come around once every few years, so don't hesitate. Isn't it about time you seized the opportunity that is dangling in front of your eyes?\\n",

            "content": "\"This opportunity is always dangling in front of your eyes. You must grab this opportunity and act on it. And if you not, you will walk this life as now, ever unchanging.\" For starters, the opportunity would be this anime, and you shouldn't miss it, as it will impact your life, just as the quote suggests.\r\nThis starts off with a fast dialog quickly summing you up on the \"world\" the main characters lives in. You will quickly notice the special art that is very different from regular anime in any age. It doesn't resemble any art on any anime ever made, it might rather resemblea little bit of a regular cartoon. It could suit your taste, or you can just live on with it, however, this kind of artstyle is very open to symbolic images. Rather then watching how the plot progresses, the animation is based around the thoughts of the character. In the same time while you're reading the subs, you could take a glimpse of the image going on, and it will force you to think at the same time while reading. So this is not for just pass time, it fills a role of a psychological activity that might change the way you think about certain situations in life.\\n\\n\r\nThe most amazing thing about this anime are the characters. They're well thought out and written. Watashi, the protagonist, is just a regular guy pursuing the regular \"rose-colored campus life\". He thinks that it is perfectly normal, that it is finally time to leave his past behind, and start anew.  On his \"adventures\" he meets Ozu. He is a \"demon\" looking guy, his look resembles his personality as in he feeds on others unhappiness and sadness. Another notable character would be Akashi. She is not so sociable, doesn't like to interact with others, but she's very open to people that are close to her. There are many other characters, but telling you about them here would just spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother unique part of this show would be it's diversity. As it offers many different perspectives throughout the episodes, featuring \"new\" characters, or rather remade characters. This show with its diversity makes you question is what you're doing the right choice? I mean it's the right choice to watch this, but I'm reffering to normal life. This teaches you in some way that what's done is done. You can wish, or think of what would've happened if you did or didn't do something, but that alternative way won't happen. However, you can experience how it would really end up if it did, in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis also shows you that while you're going for your life goal, you're living your life, not when you reach it. When you do, many more ways to other goals open. \\n\\n\r\nSome episodes serve as a purpose for later development but just going through them isn't as fun as watching the climax of the show. Most of them are actually very fun, but there are 1 or 2 that are good, but not so fulfilling. Those episodes before the climax are what tells me to not give this show a 10 because these little flaws are what keep the perfect shows from near perfect, so i settled for a 9.\\n\\n\r\nEven though this appears mysterious , the message of this anime is clear as a river, so you won't have the \"wtf factor\" up.  I repeat, you shouldn't miss this opportunity.",

            "content": "If there was ever a time to slow clap it out, this would be the precise time to.\r\nThis series really is why I love episodic series. The bad ones obviously suck beyond belief, but when shows like this one make optimal use of them they can really turn into something unique, and the short stories can allow for ideas that would normally not fit within a linear storyline. A lot of things have to be done right in order to get a good episodic series, though, but to me the key seems to be creativity, along with somehow finding a way to build-up: connecting thedifferent episodes together. I believe that if these aren\u2019t present, you\u2019re just better off with a linear storyline in order to get the best out of your characters. But Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei has both of them.\\n\\n\r\nA man is miserable. Despite all his dreams of a \u201cRose-Coloured Campus Life\u201d filled with raven-haired maidens who dote on him, his social life is going nowhere. He has no girlfriend, his only good friend keeps getting him into trouble, and the circle he joined brings him no joy. So he tries again, and again, reliving his first two years of college life ad nauseum, making different decisions each time, having no recollection that he\u2019s already done this all before. Will the man ever be satisfied with how his life turns out?\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs have a stylish comic book economy that give the impression the animators completed each frame in just a few strokes. The exception is Ozu, Watashi's friend who has a frightfully amphibious face: a head like a fish's, teeth like a shark's, and unnervingly dark lips set against a pale visage. Occasionally, in his wiliest moments, they give him a wagging fox tail. Other than that, most of the artistry occurs in the background details (fractal patterns in the trees and the scenery made of eerie black-and-white live-action photography), the framing of the shots, and the precision editing, which cement Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei's patchwork aesthetic beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nThey tend to merge real life shots and video in with the episodes when appropriate and it doesn't seem too out of place which is kinda hard to do so that's a plus. There were no crazy battles, no artsy flips or anything out of the ordinary. However what they did need to do was done well.\\n\\n\r\nThe artistic style is loose and stylized, which helps purposefully misrepresent the characters and allows for the art to change at the drop of a hat. Allusions and symbolism between episodes are amusing or subtle, keeping the story creative in its connections. Most of all, the sense of humor of the series continually seeks to entertain even when the general atmosphere is introspective, maintaining the show\u2019s levity throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is borderline strong - the OP is a modern classic by AKFG - I rarely sit through the OP on anime, but I did throughout this series.\\n\r\nThe ED was pretty fitting especially for the mood at the end of each episode and oddly seemed to also fit the animation sequence.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the OST is just a decent compliment to the whole story but never takes on a life past background music, arguably what it's intended for and in which case would be perfect but sometimes you can't beat a crazy score overlaying a scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting is very well-done, too.  It takes talent to be able to speak so quickly and so level-headedly as Watashi, and Shintaro Asanuma does not disappoint.  Even the more cartoonish, exaggerated characters like Ozu and Higuchi receive proper treatment.\\n\\n\r\nYuasa Masaaki\u2019s work on Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei thrives on its ability to avoid stagnation and build a developing story even when each episode follows the exact same structure. In fact, it is this very paradox that drives the creativity. Wonderfully planned out, believable, and deep.\\n\\n\r\nYuasa\u2019s dynamic storytelling is further bolstered by the characters, who act as the foundation of the ever-changing state of the singular story. The main character Watashi, or simply I, acts as the unreliable narrator, which drives the perspective of the show. The defeatist attitude with which he views the world skews the very nature of things. His character seems pitiful, his actions absurd. Yet it is these very actions that form his identity as he moves from episode to episode. He is not a static character that commits the same mistake again and again; rather, the choices he makes are multiform and logically or emotionally sound, even if his character flaws cause him to fail again and again.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are equally delightful in their depictions, which begin archetypical and seemingly one-dimensional. Some are malicious, others are lecherous, and a few are downright whimsical. But Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is quick to remind us of Watashi\u2019s unreliability by providing alternate looks at these characters, creating interpretations that are hardly apparent at the beginning but still complimentary to the quirks seen in the first few episodes. The development of these characters come naturally, and their presence in the story support Watashi\u2019s characterization immensely.\\n\\n\r\nAt first sight, the way in which this series keeps resetting itself after every episode may seem weird at first, but it actually was a brilliant method to flesh out its different characters. Because of its very frequent resets, this stands out even more than series that did similar things in the past, like Higurashi and Umineko. Because of this, we get to see a ton of different sides of the characters that would never have been able to been shown without these resets, and the most important part is that we see Watashi develop in many different ways throughout each episode. The different side-characters all have their own parts to play in Watashi (the lead character)\u2019s world and everything comes together wonderfully in the final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is one of the most underrated, under appreciated and unknown anime. It is a hidden gem unknown to people. You will rarely see an anime that is very funny but has a very deep meaning. If you are looking for a unique, non-mainstream, non-complex and very interesting story.\\n\\n\r\nThis really is an amazing work. It'll make you rethink life which is rare these days. Sure an anime might awe you with an amazing character to the point you try to emulate their traits. But very few make you reconsider life from a new point of view. I highly suggest you watch it, because it really has it all.\\n\\n\r\nSo let us all gather around a 4.5 Tatami Room slurping on our delicious Neko Ramen.",

            "content": "The choices you make might change, but the end result will always be the same.\r\nFor our unnamed main character\u2014we\u2019ll call him Watashi\u2014this couldn\u2019t be more true. He\u2019s a college dropout at the end of his rope, eating a meal at the end of the night at a ramen stand. There, he meets a (self proclaimed) God of Matrimony. After this God\u2019s inexplicably large chin tells Watashi that he basically knows everything about him, our hapless main character is sent on a flashback to his not so great college years.\r\nThe flashback of his college years zips on by, and so does Watashi\u2019s narration of events. Hetalks at a thousand miles per hour, and that might keep people away from watching this show since the dialog is hard to follow. Don\u2019t. Watashi is hard to follow, but the show he\u2019s in isn\u2019t. Think of him as a guy being forced to talk about what happened in his past but does so as fast and painless as he can. He\u2019s selfish, and doesn\u2019t care about easing the viewer into his life nor does he care for seeing people as they are.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, while Watashi\u2019s lightspeed narration takes over the soundtrack, the way he sees the world takes over the visuals. Every backdrop looks like a cardboard cutout and the characters lack color, but the design choice is deliberate. The design shows the way Watashi sees the world, so focused on himself that what he sees around him might as well be a parody. The easygoing members of the Softball Club, for example, all have the same smiling face, while the repo men of the Bicycle Police (don\u2019t ask) look more like gorilla\u2019s in prison suits. Yes, really.\\n\\n\r\nThis narrow focus from Watashi also affects what the viewer learns about the people in his life, meaning not much is learned about them at all. Instead, the characters are closer to ideas in his life. Jougasaki, for example, is Watashi\u2019s antithesis for success, being handsome, buff, and leads the Misogi Movie Club, while Watashi is average looking, scrawny, and barely keeps his place in any club. Jougasaki and his biceps often play the villain role to Watashi, and his other hobbies include boobs, a far cry from Watashi\u2019s sexual repression.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Ozu, the wildcard in Watashi\u2019s life, the kind of guy who can be one\u2019s best friend or worst enemy depending on how one approaches life. Ozu\u2019s described as not having a single good trait about him, but as the show goes on he shows a wit sharper than his teeth and foresight wider than his narrow eyes. Watashi\u2014and the viewer\u2014is never sure how Ozu does what he does, whether it\u2019s getting classified information or hijacking a blimp. But Ozu\u2019s also the fall guy, who Watashi blames for the way his life has turned out.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, as Watashi is sent on a flashback through his not so great college years, he thinks that his life might\u2019ve turned out better if he joined a different club, so he joins the Tennis Club. He doesn\u2019t just want a good life, but a rose colored campus life. Through club activities, he plans to surround himself with raven haired maidens and reach sweet, sweet romance. But he can\u2019t make any friends, let alone start a romance, and is instead stuck with Ozu. Whether from Ozu\u2019s mischief, Jougasaki\u2019s villainy, or his own selfishness, Watashi ends up not liking where his life ends up, and relives his flashback to join a different club in hopes of getting a rose colored campus life.\\n\\n\r\nAnd does it again.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter what club Watashi joins, the end result is always the same, and he never seems to learn. Do more than a few things always go wrong after Watashi joins a club? Maybe. Is Watashi setting his expectations too high? Definitely. But how else would he act? He\u2019s fresh out of high school and been sheltered all his life. A guy like that is bound to be a hopelessly na\u00efve fool, as he often points out every time his hopes are dashed. But what\u2019s really baffling\u2014or believable, in his case\u2014is how often he looks past what\u2014or who\u2014he does have, like Akashi.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because Akashi is that friend, who\u2019s also a girl, who might become Watashi\u2019s girlfriend if he just thought to talk to her more. She treats him more fondly than she treats others, but she doesn\u2019t throw herself at him. She has other concerns, like her engineering, and always tells it like she sees it, able to keep even Jougasaki at bay. She isn\u2019t the companion Watashi deserves, but the companion Watashi needs. That said, the romance is non-existent, but this show isn\u2019t a romance; it\u2019s a story about a guy who wouldn\u2019t know opportunity if it dangled in front of his face.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while Watashi ignores opportunity, he keeps reliving his college years in hopes of getting a rose colored campus life. Through this, the show becomes frustrating, but not for the right reasons.\\n\\n\r\nFor theme, it makes sense for the show\u2019s story to be repetitive. Because no matter what choice Watashi makes, the end result is always the same. The problem is the show\u2019s repetitive execution. The first five episodes have different set-ups, but the opening, middle, and final act of each episode is roughly the same. It tries to be different with each episode, but those common threads end up bringing focus to how similar they are.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the last six episodes take the same set-up, but they play out differently and are only similar in their final acts. They don\u2019t try too hard to be unified, and this lets each episode be its own story while still keeping to the show\u2019s theme, which makes for a refreshing watch. But this begs the question of why the show doesn\u2019t do something similar for its first half. The show is supposed to be challenging, I get it, but until the halfway point it\u2019s not even obtuse; just awfully repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nThat repetition also brings down the characters. As characters themselves, they\u2019re all great. But their interactions with each other become repetitive. Seeing Watashi dread his first meeting with Ozu loses impact after the second time, and the scene of Watashi saving Akashi from a random moth can only be cute so many times before it becomes old hat. Until the show\u2019s second half, their interactions with each other become predictable, and the sad thing is it doesn\u2019t need to be.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the nature of the show\u2019s theme ends up making it too easy for it to become repetitive. But since it was able to keep the story refreshing from the halfway point onward, I have to wonder what this show could have become if its effort were better directed in the first half. It definitely has thematic focus, it knows what it wants to say, and has a great cast of characters needed to say it. It could be an excellent show, but it\u2019s not there yet.\\n\\n\r\nI say \u201cyet\u201d because writing and directing is something that can improve with time. I\u2019d like to see this show remade with that improvement in mind, its effort redirected to avoid being repetitive, to be better than it is now. It DID show the ability to be better than it is now, which makes it so frustrating it fell short of being excellent. As it is now, Tatami Galaxy isn\u2019t a rose colored experience, but it\u2019s definitely an opportunity worth grabbing.",

Expectations of a rose-coloured campus life and regrets are no exception either; such is the case of Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, also known as Tatami Galaxy, in which a nameless protagonist exactly has these issues. It is a fantastic journey into the realm of university life, mingled with time travelling.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe premise of Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei may be of simple nature at first glance, having thenameless protagonist, often referred to as \"Watashi\", live a rather lackluster life in comparison with his own expectations. This is due to mainly Ozu, both his friend and enemy, as he seems to make his life as miserable as possible, besides Watashi himself being a lazy, gutless person. The protagonist finds himself one day eating together with a aubergine faced man, which makes him reflect on his past years of college that in turn hurls him through time to experience his life anew.\\n\\n\r\nTime travelling - time loops in this case - is certainly of one the most interesting aspects of the anime. Watashi repeatedly lives his student life each time, though there is a gist to it: he remembers nothing each time this happens, only having vague memories of events and people around him. This may seem simple, but there is little margin for error upon executing such a narrative, as it can end in failure when handled improperly. Each episode is well done with a natural progression of events; however, as story progresses, the time travels may feel repetitive. Comedic relief is also available, presented through events and encounters with people who serve to enhance the overall atmosphere of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is treated as an independent one, yet viewers observe how in each chapter human relationships are shown and developed, as well as displaying hints that adds to the overall progression of the storyline, which in the final episode all events of the puzzle fall together with a satisfying conclusion. These afore-mentioned relationships are such, that anyone can easily relate to the main protagonist and all the events that take place, being stuck with a drunkard or any other club activity. Other aspect of the anime is the heavy monologuing that take place, which occasionally can be surprisingly fast, making it difficult to follow the story when not fully committing to the anime.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is small, yet of great diversity, people types you can often find in university. However, the main focus of the story doesn't lie on secondary characters, being Watashi its main focus. This is not to say that these aren't well crafted; each is an interesting character on its own that contribute a great deal to the overall progression of events, which are crucial for understanding actions and relationships of the different characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for character development, only Watashi is of importance. Throughout the anime viewers observe how he evolves from being indesicive and lazy, to a person he always aspired to be, straightforward and honest. Other interesting character is Ozu, who seems to be the source of ailments for Watashi. He is somewhat the \"enemy\" of the main protagonist, yet all his actions have purpose. I believe him to represent the way we interpret people, which doesn't necessarily reflect their genuine personality, as Watashi undergoes changes, his point of view on Ozu does as well.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Tatami Galaxy is of high quality, character movements being fluid. The art style is another matter, as it can be a hit/miss for viewers. At first it gave the impression of being a Shaft produced anime with the visuals and heavy monologuing, yet to my surprise, it was actually produced by Madhouse. It is very unconventional, yet fits well when trying to display characters behaviour and the environment through bending character movements and environments; backgrounds are not spared either. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors performed their roles well, being Watashi's and Ozu's one certainly the most appealing to hear, followed by Akashi's voice actor. The soundtrack used fulfilled its purpose, yet is nothing outstanding. I must mention that the opening song had quite the catchy tune.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nYojouhan Shinwa Taikei was overall an enjoyable experience with a well crafted storyline and good use of the time travelling concept. Characters were well presented and were of importance to the story. I am personally no real fan of this art style, and found it rather off-putting at first. I myself found the different events an interesting watch, yet couldn't really identify myself with it, consequently not fully enjoying it. Nevertheless, I can easily see why this is so popular, so I can recommended it to anyone who has an interest in college life. After all, this a wonderful story of acceptance of yourself and embracement of the countless oportunities life has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "We all carry regrets throughout our lives and experiences we feel have been a detriment to us. They can range from the seemingly smallest things to those events which we feel turn our world upside down for the worst. But what if we spend more time thinking about how those experiences shape us and help us benefit in the future? \r\nThe Tatami Galaxy sets out to explore this and it manages to do so through marvellous storytelling, vivid art, expressive dialogue and meaningful characters. It is, in short, a truly memorable experience.\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is a story about life and how we choose to liveit. We often set expectations for how we want things to unfold but we either don't have the courage to make these things take place. To help carry such an important message it's vital that your main character be a well written one. Thankfully that's the case here. Our protagonist Watashi is your average student dealing with these problems of trying to construct a positive future. When he sets out to achieve his dream 'rosy' campus life he soon finds there are many hurdles to overcome. Our protagonist is easy enough to relate to in some form. Whether it may be his ambitious, caring, evil, envious or loving side it's always very believable and quite real. His experiences from episode to episode make you care for what conclusion may come his way. His character evolution is brilliantly handled.\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to dive into the story much further than what has already been stated in the synopsis and not ruin the experience. The main plot device used between the episodes is certainly nothing new but thankfully the mixture of colourful characters and superb dialogue, in particular from leading pair Watashi and Ozu, help carry the show through that. The talking comes quick, not a second is wasted when watching. It can range from philosophical without being overbearing through to being humorous without overdoing it. It's arguably the biggest strength of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest themes the show rolls with is seeing things from new perspectives, and just when the show has you seeing characters in a particular light it starts to shape them into something different. The supporting cast are all interesting both in their backgrounds and their design. For a show very much centred around one person it's great to see the cast around him were still very nicely fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art may turn some people off but to me it screams creativity. It's a blend of the abstract, exaggerated and expressive. The show jumps between prominent colours frequently but also does so with meaning, using it as a means to set a tone or express the development of our main character. The backgrounds are also gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy explores a sizeable portion of themes - love, sex, ambition, depression, greed - but they are all balanced out well. This balance is on display no better than in the final two, perfectly packaged final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it's very difficult to tell people much about the show without spoiling anything. Just experience it. Take a plunge. You're bound to take something positive away from it.",

            "content": "~Multilingual review, English & Espa\u00f1ol: The Tatami Galaxy~.\r\nLife wouldn't be less than a simple and plain matter of choices, wherever our life is right now is due to the choices we've made in the past, we're doing and we'll probably make in the future, considering everything said \"Life\"  would just be an abbreviation of the sum of choices we've made up until now.\r\nSo...?\r\nHave you ever thought about them?, the choices you've made I mean, I\u2019m pretty sure everyone have dedicated, at least a little moment of their time, to muse about the choices we've made so far in our lives, important or mundaneones, it matters not. The best moment would be maybe while we're spacing out during a boring lesson in our classroom or when we're just slacking off a bit at our working place, or if our personality is that of the \"pensive\" type we already have a space in our schedule to muse about the little events in our lives, leaving aside the type of personality we've, I'm pretty sure we do all have asked ourselves the unavoidable question \"What if...\" didn't we?.\\n\\n\r\n\"Maybe I should have seated next to that pretty girl in the bus, but instead I\u2019ve decided to stand up\".\\n\\n\r\nJust an example, how can my life change due to that mundane and maybe insignificant event?, impossible to know it and for that I question myself now \"What if I\u2019ve seated with that girl?\", a quick reply to that question could be, even if it\u2019s a little creative, that I could have talked with her a little during the ridesharing, I could have found that she's a wonderful girl and she thinks nice of me, next day she could have reserved the sit for me and again we start to talk, this could have lead me to ask her out, to fall in love, get engaged and when I didn't even realize it I've already married that girl. What was the triggering event for that?, \"a stupid and mundane choice when I was young\" would be the answer of an older version of myself, or maybe, a more realistic scenery would be that the girl gets off of that bus and it was the last time I saw her, anyway it wouldn't be completely wrong to say that we're the product of our choices, but not only, since also the people we meet have the power to change us considerably; maybe you're asking \"what does all this things have to do with the review and with this anime?\" to that I reply \"quite everything\", since \"we're the product of our Choices\" is the main theme of the anime I'm now going to introduce you, The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\n(Since our protagonist is nameless I shall now refer to him, from now on, as \"The Protagonist\")\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the development of the story, we can see how different can be the life of The Protagonist based on the choices he had made and the people he had meet during his first year of University. The premise of this anime is to show us how different could be our lives due to a choice, in our protagonist's case, the choice of a Club to join. How can the choice of joining a certain Club be considered as something important, something that could change completely our lives?, at a first gaze I would say \u201cit\u2019s quite improbable\" but I couldn't be more wrong and for our protagonist that couldn't be more true. The Cinema Club?, Tennis Club?, Softball Club?, English Club?, it doesn't matter; all of this show is about The Protagonist's pursuit of his \u201crose-colored campus life\u201d and what would be that? well it's Everyone's dream: being popular, a lot of friends and a cute girlfriend but that's something that reveals to be a particulary difficult goal to reach for our timid protagonist and lucky isn't even by his side since someone is obstructing him and that obstruction it's represented by a physical person, another character of this anime, Ozu. The relation between Ozu and The Protagonist is a bit weird but I totally loved it, Ozu could be or your best friend or you worst enemy, depending how you approach him. So through many of the clubs The Protagonist joins we're the audience of what would happen to his life if he had only joined a different club in his first year.\\n\\n\r\nThe story telling of this anime is unique, incredible unique if I must say it. We need to think of it as a puzzle, a puzzle with 11 parts (11 as the episodes of this anime), so little by little we need to fill the missing parts until it gets finished, at that moment we can actually gaze the wonderfully picture that have been created.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that strike us are the characters, they're unique in their own way, all of them have a characteristic that would lead them to being crafted into our minds, starting from The Protagonist to the Fortune Teller (you'll love that old baba!) since they are made of a simplicity and yet they're so unique that you'll have a hard time trying to get them off your head (admitted if you want to). First we have The Protagonist, he's a first year University student, quite shy and easily manipulated by the other characters of this show, especially Ozu, whose failing to obtain his precious rose colored life consider his life a total waste. Ozu, whose The Protagonist usually describe his first meet with him as \"the first as well as worst\", he's a devil like little guy but not only because of his behavior which is indeed evil (\"He eats people's unhappiness with three helpings of rice\" - The Protagonist's words) but also because of his appearance, he's also the best and only friend of our protagonist. These two are the most important characters in the show, I won't talk about each of them since Tatami Galaxy's really offer a large and above all, original and interesting cast of characters, otherwise this review could get really long. Even if the story revolves around The Protagonist, the other characters aren't less important, I would say actually they're more important than him for the development since our protagonist is a passive character; Remember?...not only the choices are important but also the people we meet could lead our lives to an unexpected turn. This anime goes that far too actually made us understand that not experiencing something is actually an experience itself, and we won't understand that until we finish this anime. The ending is something special; it gives the whole meaning for this show. Comedy isn't missing neither, this show stands out also for its comedy scenes, and every character will make you laugh in a different way, their own way. Johnny' scenes, a character's show, are memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite particular too, even if you may find it weird at the first sight, we get used to it quite fast and maybe we ask ourselves \"Why there aren't more shows like this?\u201d, The animation is Madhouse Studio, so we can count with an incredible high level animation, characteristic trademark of this studio. The OST suited perfectly every scene, from those more \" lively\" ones to those passives, but for one strange reason we don't give the deserved attention to them, that\u2019s because The Protagonist's speed light monologues will take most of our concentration, leaving the OST in the background, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Both OP/ED are amazing too, I especially liked more the OP single.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you're able to read very quickly you won't be able to leave the Pause button aside, since The Protagonist usually talks in a very speedy way that sometimes we aren't able to read the subtitles in time but that won't be the only thing to interrupt us during the vision of this anime, there are also those The Protagonist's monologues which are so filled with meaning and extremely well written that we could actually feel the urgent of going back to rewatch them, an action I actually repeat many times. It\u2019s incredible but every single phrase pronounced in this show has its own charming and filled with meaning, Wikiquote would have a lot of pages filled with our characters phrases, and I'm not referring to those clich\u00e9 ones we find everywhere, Tatami Galaxy's ones are all original.\\n\\n\r\nThere are anime with meaning and moral, there are anime with funny characters, there are anime with an incredible story and unique storytelling, but I need to say that The Tatami Galaxy was composed by all of them. I would recommend (personal experience) to rewatch this anime after some time, because its incredible the amount of particulars that could be missed the first time, after all, re-watching an anime to us dear let us appreciate those little particulars we could have missed the first time, and in The Tatami Galaxy's case I can assure you'll be surprised.\\n\\n\r\nI've expressed myself the best I could, I hope this review moves someone into watching this anime because it\u2019s really worth. I'm going to leave you, the readers, to visualize the whole boc\u00f3n of things said in this review, don't hesitate and jump into it you won\u2019t regret it, in that case I\u2019ve realized my main point for this review, otherwise I apologize for being unable to send my feelings towards this incredible anime to you since it's only my fault as a novice reviewer as I'm.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, thanks you for spending time for reading it\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Espa\u00f1ol]\\n\\n\r\nLa Vida se reduce a las decisiones tomadas. Cualquiera sea el modo en que est\u00e9 nuestra vida ahora, se debe exclusivamente a las decisiones que hemos hecho en el pasado. Lo que nos lleva a decir que no estar\u00edamos del todo en error al decir que la Vida no es nada m\u00e1s que la suma de nuestras decisiones. Personalmente soy una persona que no cree en el Destino, pues me gusta pensar que tenemos el control total de nuestras vidas, el control de las decisiones que tendremos que afrontar. Me gusta pensar que tenemos frente a nosotros una cantidad infinita de puertas en vez de una sola.\\n\\n\r\n\u00bfAlguna vez has pensado en ellas, las decisiones que has tomado? Estoy seguro que cualquiera ha dedicado, aunque sea un poco de tiempo, para meditar sobre ellas. Importantes o no, el mejor momento para ello podr\u00eda ser cuando estamos ociando durante una lecci\u00f3n aburrida en la escuela, o mientras ociamos un poco en el trabajo o, si somos del tipo pensativo, no necesitamos estar aburridos para dedicar un poco de nuestro tiempo a meditar sobre todo. Estoy seguro que al menos una vez nos hemos preguntado \"\u00bfC\u00f3mo ser\u00eda si..?\".\\n\\n\r\n\"Tal vez deber\u00eda haberme sentado al lado de esa chica, pero decid\u00ed quedarme de pie\"\\n\\n\r\nEs s\u00f3lo un ejemplo, \u00bfc\u00f3mo cambiar\u00eda mi vida debido a ese evento tan com\u00fan y corriente?. No soy capaz de saberlo y por eso si me pregunto \"\u00bfy si me hubiese sentado con ella?\" una respuesta veloz, aunque un poco creativa, ser\u00eda que habr\u00eda comenzado a charlar con ella y me dar\u00eda cuenta que es una chica estupenda y de que, sorprendentement,e ella piensa lo mismo sobre m\u00ed. Al d\u00eda siguiente me la encuentro de nuevo y comenzamos a charlar otra vez, y esto me lleva a pedirle un d\u00eda de salir conmigo, a enamorarme de ella y as\u00ed sucesivamente al matrimonio. \u00bfCu\u00e1l ser\u00eda el evento que me llev\u00f3 a todo eso? \"Una decisi\u00f3n com\u00fan y corriente cuando era joven\" ser\u00eda la respuesta de mi Yo anciano o, siendo m\u00e1s realista, la chica se baja del tren y esa fue la \u00faltima vez que la vi. No estar\u00edamos del todo errados al decir que nosotros somos el producto de decisiones, pero no solamente nuestras decisiones, pues las personas que encontramos a lo largo de nuestro camino tienen el incre\u00edble poder de cambiarnos\u2026Tal vez os est\u00e9s preguntado \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 tiene que ver todo esto con la review o con el anime?\" y a eso le respondo: \"pr\u00e1cticamente todo\", porque \"Somos el producto de nuestras decisiones\" es el tema principal de la serie que ahora les voy a presentar, The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\n(Siendo nuestro protagonista un sin nombre, lo llamar\u00e9, a partir de ahora, El Protagonista)\\n\\n\r\nA lo largo del desarrollo de la historia, podremos ver como ser\u00eda la vida de nuestro protagonista en base a las decisiones que escoge el primer a\u00f1o de universidad y a las personas que encuentra en ella. La premisa de esta historia es mostrarnos cuan diferente pueden ser nuestras vidas debido a una decisi\u00f3n que tomamos. En el caso de nuestro protagonista, la decisi\u00f3n de un Club al cual unirse. \u00bfC\u00f3mo podr\u00eda revelarse ser una decisi\u00f3n que cambiar\u00eda nuestras vidas el escoger a cu\u00e1l club pertenecer? Es algo que consider\u00e9 imposible a una primera impresi\u00f3n, algo que se puede considerar una deducci\u00f3n completamente err\u00f3nea despu\u00e9s. \u00bfEl Club de Cine? \u00bfClub de Tenis?, \u00bfFootball Club? \u00bfEl Club de Ingles? No tendr\u00eda importancia de verdad pues el objetivo de nuestro protagonista es encontrar lo que \u00e9l considera \"La vida color rosa\". \u00bfDe qu\u00e9 se trata esta? Pues eso ser\u00eda el sue\u00f1o de todo el mundo: Ser popular, muchos amigos y una bella novia, algo que, claramente, para nuestro t\u00edmido protagonista se revela ser una misi\u00f3n imposible. Ni siquiera la buena suerte lo acompa\u00f1a, pues se encuentra siempre siendo obstaculizado. El obst\u00e1culo en este caso es una persona f\u00edsica, otro personaje de este anime, mi favorito, Ozu. La relaci\u00f3n entre Ozu y El Protagonista es una de las m\u00e1s geniales que he visto. Fuera de lo normal, pero algo que completamente am\u00e9. Ozu o podr\u00eda ser tu mejor amigo o tu peor enemigo, depende de c\u00f3mo te le acerques en vuestro primer encuentro. Entonces, a lo largo de este anime, nosotros seremos los espectadores de c\u00f3mo seria la vida de nuestro pobre protagonista, y c\u00f3mo esta ser\u00eda diferente si s\u00f3lo se hubiera unido a otro club su primer a\u00f1o.\\n\\n\r\nLa narraci\u00f3n de esta historia es \u00fanica, incre\u00edblemente \u00fanica si tengo que precisar. Si queremos podemos pensar de esta como un rompecabezas: un rompecabezas de 11 piezas (11 como los episodios de este anime) que poco a poco va cogiendo forma, s\u00f3lo colocando la \u00faltima pieza es que podremos apreciar la imagen completa y admirarla es todo su esplendor.\\n\\n\r\nLa primera cosa que nos impactar\u00e1 en esta serie ser\u00edan sus personajes, los cuales son \u00fanicos en su forma de ser, hasta dejar una huella en nuestras mentes que dif\u00edcilmente desaparecer\u00e1. Comenzando por El Protagonista hasta la Vieja Adivina (\u00a1Adorar\u00e1s a esa vieja!), todos son tan simples, pero a la vez son tan \u00fanicos que dif\u00edcilmente los encontrar\u00e1s aburridos. Primero que todo tenemos a nuestro protagonista, un chico bastante t\u00edmido y reservado f\u00e1cilmente manipulable por otros, especialmente Ozu, el cual al haber fallado en su b\u00fasqueda por la \"vida color rosa\" siente que su vida hasta ahora ha sido un completo desperdicio. Despu\u00e9s tenemos a Ozu, sl cual el protagonista suele describir su primer encuentro con el como \"el primero al igual que el peor\". \\n\\n\r\n\u00c9l es un chicho mal\u00e9volo, y no s\u00f3lo por su comportamiento (\"\u00c9l se come la infelicidad de la gente con un contorno de arroz\" palabras de nuestro protagonista), sino tambi\u00e9n por su apariencia que, es de hecho, demon\u00edaca. Estos dos son los personajes m\u00e1s importantes del show. No me pondr\u00e9 a hablar sobre los dem\u00e1s porque Tatami Galaxy ofrece un cast de personajes muy amplio, pero, sobre todo, interesante y original, lo cual me tomar\u00eda mucho tiempo y esta review se pondr\u00eda muy larga. Si bien la historia gira entorno a El Protagonista, los otros personajes no son menos notables. Yo dir\u00eda que son hasta m\u00e1s importantes para el desarrollo de la historia que el propio protagonista, debido a que este \u00faltimo es un personaje pasivo, \u00bfRecuerdas?... No s\u00f3lo las decisiones son importantes, porque tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n las personajes las cuales le pueden dar un gran giro inesperado a nuestras vidas. Este anime llega tan lejos tanto da mostrarnos que no experimentar algo es una experiencia en s\u00ed y eso no lo llegaremos a comprender hasta el final de este anime. El final es algo especial, algo que le da todo un significado a la experiencia que hemos visto. La comedia no falta, de hecho este anime resalta sobretodo por su comedia, cada personaje te har\u00e1 re\u00edr en un modo diferente, el modo de cada uno de ellos. Las partes de Johnny, un personaje del show, son memorables.\\n\\n\r\nLos dise\u00f1os son bastantes particulares tambi\u00e9n. Aunque se pueden encontrar extravagantes en principio, nos acostumbramos de una manera veloz a ellos, a tal modo que nos preguntamos \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no hay m\u00e1s como estos?\". La animaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 hecha por el estudio Madhouse, famoso por la atenci\u00f3n y la extrema precisi\u00f3n en sus trabajos. Es de verdad muy fluida y perfecta. El OST encaja perfectamente en cada escena de la serie, desde las m\u00e1s pasivas hasta las m\u00e1s activas. , un particular extra\u00f1o es que por la mayor parte el OST pasa desapercibido, debido a que los mon\u00f3logos a la velocidad de la luz de nuestro protagonista se llevan la mayor parte de nuestra atenci\u00f3n, dejando el OST en un plano fuera de nuestra percepci\u00f3n, lo cual no es necesariamente algo malo. OP/ED fueron muy buenos, a m\u00ed me gust\u00f3 mucho m\u00e1s el OP single.\\n\\n\r\nSi tu capacidad de lectura no es lo suficientemente veloz estar\u00e1s pegado al bot\u00f3n de pausa. Eso es porque El Protagonista habla de una manera tan veloz que es casi imposible seguirlo, haciendo la comprensi\u00f3n algo dif\u00edcil. Pero esa no ser\u00e1 la \u00fanica vez que echaremos el video para atr\u00e1s, porque tambi\u00e9n los mon\u00f3logos de nuestro protagonista est\u00e1n tan llenos de significado que los querremos leer de nuevo. Puede ser incre\u00edble, pero cada frase dicha en esta serie es tan llena de significado y resplandece con tanta luz propia que Wikiquote tendr\u00eda p\u00e1ginas enteras s\u00f3lo con los di\u00e1logos de nuestros personajes\u2026 Y no estoy hablando de esas frases baratas que se consiguen en todas las series, las de Tatami Galaxy son todas originales.\\n\\n\r\nHay animes con significado y moral, los hay con personajes divertidos, hay animes con una incre\u00edble narraci\u00f3n y desarrollo de la historia, pero tengo que decir que The Tatami Galaxy tiene todo esto y m\u00e1s. Yo recomendar\u00eda (experiencia personal) ver de nuevo esta serie despu\u00e9s de un tiempo. De eso modo nos podemos dar cuenta de la incre\u00edble cantidad de particulares que se dejan atr\u00e1s mientras los estamos viendo por primera vez. Porque, despu\u00e9s de todo, mirar de nuevo un anime que nos gust\u00f3 nos da la posibilidad de apreciar esos peque\u00f1os detalles que nos pudimos haber saltado, y en este caso hay bastantes. \\n\\n\r\nMe exprese lo mejor que he podido, espero que esta review les ayude a decidiros a dedicar vuestro tiempo en este anime, porque de verdad lo vale. Ahora voy a dejar a ustedes, los lectores, el tiempo de visualizar todo lo que se dijo hasta ahora. Si acaso encuentran a este un poco interesante, les digo que no lo duden y denle una oportunidad, ese es el objetivo principal de esta review. Si no es as\u00ed, pues no logr\u00e9 trasmitir mis emociones sobre esta gran serie con \u00e9xito al ser a\u00fan un principiante.\\n\\n\r\nEn cualquier caso, les agradezco su tiempo.\\n\\n\r\nGracias.",

            "content": "I don't mean to get deep and definitely not right off the bat, but it's pretty true that small events can change the course of your life whether you're aware or not and that is what Yojou-han Shinwa Taikei (or the 4.5 Tatami Mat Galaxy) is all about. Sure it's also about pleasing your Johnny, hijacking blimps, engaging in prank wars, being ripped off by fortune tellers, joining the local power ranger squad, and eating cats and castella, but that's all trivial. Brought to you by the same guy who brought you Mind Game, Cat Soup, and Kaiba, Masaaki Yuasa, brings you what I wouldlike to refer to as his best work yet.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nA nameless protagonist, referred to as Watashi ('I') by himself, has just entered college, and the story more or less follows his many lives and many misfortunes. Each episode starts with Watashi pursuing something inane or stupid - like a \"rose-colored campus life\" or \"raven-haired maidens\" and in each episode his friend Ozu, manages to somehow screw everything up. I say friend in the lightest sense of the term, because Ozu isn't really anyone's friend. He's a backstabbing punk who just loves to terrorize people, and he always manages to infect Watashi in one way or another, usually ending up driving him away from his goal. Along Watashi's trip across the Tatami Galaxy you're introduced to many different people, and in each life, a different story unfolds. Each story is unrelated other than by starting the same way at first glance, but you'll start noticing some patterns, and eventually it brings you to one of the most impressive endings I have ever seen. If I were to tag a genre to this anime I'd first have to say it's a slice-of-life comedy, then mystery, but it's also a really great psychological anime. It's incredibly dialogue heavy, and the first three minutes of episode one has the most text I've ever seen in an anime. That being said it can be very easy to lose track of what is going on, but if you're on your feet then you shouldn't get lost too easily.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nYojou-han is brought to you by MadHouse, which is known for it's diverse art style and in this anime's case it is either defined as pretentious or glorious. I would like to call it the latter. It's non-traditional and is unlike any other anime in existence, seriously. It's like Mononoke when Mononoke was new, it can amaze people, or turn people the heck away. It's a very vibrant anime, and everything is so fluid - movement looks just splendid. For those faint of eyes, be wary, Yojou-han Shinwa Taikei may not be the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nWell, there's a song about shapes in an early episode. That was like, totally freaking awesome. How many anime have songs about shapes? Unless Fullmetal Alchemist the Musical is coming out anytime soon, I think that's about a zero other than Yojou-han. The opening is amazing, and Asian Kung-Fu Generation does a great job (It's called \"Maigo Inu to Ame no Beat\"). I believe it's their first opening for a non-shonen show. The ending is amazingly well positioned (you'll see what I mean) and the first time you hear it I promise you'll get a small shiver. The singer is the same who sang the Arakawa Under the Bridge opening, Etsuko Yakushimaru. The voice acting for every character is of course, awesome as well. Watashi does most of the talking and I was considering favoriting his voice actor (Shintaro Asanuma) just because I liked to hear him talk. The background music is the only flaw sound-wise. There really isn't much to listen to, and even if their is, I probably didn't notice, because between following the dialogue and looking at the art, it's pretty hard to manage a third element.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI've already explained who Watashi is, but let me tell you a little more. Watashi likes shortcuts and doesn't like working, and almost can be seen as a lazy Ozu. Ozu is our antagonist most of the time. He's the downright rotten scoundrel who always leads our poor Watashi astray, and usually ends up profiting off of it. I called Watashi a \"lazy Ozu\" a moment ago because Watashi isn't an innocent little bird, he's just too lazy to put his efforts into anything other than his hobbies. Akashi, the somewhat romantic interest, is a girl who loathes moths and is bluntly cold to everyone around her. Kind of like Senjogahara (from Bakemonogatari), but easier to cope with. She's pretty funny herself, but all the characters are. We have the doll-fanatic Jougasaki, the drunk and elder Hanuki who likes to speak broken engrish, the Master Higuchi, who is an 8th year graduate who plans to travel the world, and multitudes of others (like Watashi's Johnny (see Eden of the East)). The character development is insanely good too. This anime is about Watashi's little foray of self realization, thusly he gets the most character development, but never have I seen it done so well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAn anime that can create a macrocosm within itself is an anime to be trifled with. It sets the stage with brilliant characters and visuals, brings hilarious moments throughout, and manages to deliver numerous meaningful messages. Is there a perfect world? Will I be happier with more money and women? Will I be happier doing what people say I should? Yeah. It's pretty damn complex. It's as thought provoking as Kaiba while bringing the comedy of Gintama. I think it's safe to leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nNo fanservice, no lolis, no moe, no ultra-violence, no regrets. It's intelligent without being snobby, it's stupid without being idiotic, and it's appealing without being inappropriate.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, I think you should just try it out. It's only 11 episodes, and I think for the one season range of anime, this is one of the best out there. \\n\\n\r\nDestiny is always dangling right in front of you, so why not reach out and grab this anime?",

            "content": "Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (or The Tatami Galaxy) is an anime about a university student stuck in a Groundhog Day-esque time loop. In the span of each episode, our nameless main character (he is referred to as Watashi, basically meaning \"myself\") goes over the same two years of university, unaware of the loop, each time joining a different club, in search of a \"rose-coloured campus life\".\r\nYojouhan is a rare example of a series with time loops where the loops themselves are actually played with. Throughout the 11 episodes, there are several different stories, but many of the episodes focus on the same stories as others. Whatmakes these episodes work is that we see the stories from different angles. In some episodes, we see segments of the story that aren't entirely clear, though at the time are not distracting. In later episodes, these plot points are often explained when Watashi's perspective changes and we see what actually happened. The best part of this, though, is that every episode lends pieces to a larger story. While the series is episodic, what we see effectively falls into place like a jigsaw puzzle, all coming to fruition in the final episode making for one of the most satisfying conclusions I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result of this, the first few episodes of the series don't make complete sense. They come off as being more abstract than part of an actual plot, but as the series goes on the beginning is referred to in a way that makes this start a vital piece of the puzzle. However, the start is hardly a throwaway. While not as strong as the rest of the series upon viewing, the bizarre and abstract style make the beginning an enjoyable watch anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, the way the series is presented is part of the genius. Upon starting the show, the first thing that will strike you is undoubtedly the art. The characters are drawn in an oddly cartoony way, using only one-tone colours for the art and having a rubbery kind of movement to them. This seems like an odd choice, but it does help to draw you into the unique world of Yojouhan, and later in the story it even gets used for plot purposes. This is also combined with a lot of black and white live-action shots, wherein the characters are sometimes drawn over the actors.\\n\\n\r\nThe strange presentation doesn't stop there, though. One strange feature of Yojouhan is that Watashi is very fond of monologuing, in a way very reminiscent of Kyon (from the Haruhi Suzumiya series, in case you've been living under a rock). He does so, however, at a very high speed. If the show has a fault, it is this, but it's more of a double-edged sword than a flaw outright. For people who aren't great at reading, the high speed of the subtitles can often make the things Watashi says hard to keep up with, but it's rarely overwhelming. On the plus side of it, it helps to keep the pacing of Yojouhan fast, which keeps the series interesting, an important factor in a series that is driven with an abundance of dialogue (excellent though the dialogue may be).\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that could have easily been dull or just weird if it had been handled wrongly, it only makes sense that even more precautions are made to make sure that there isn't a dull second in Yojouhan, as evidenced by the motormouthed narration. What helps with this is that rather than being thrown into an entirely new plot every time, there are a few elements that remain the same throughout every story. The beginning and end of each episode are usually the same, as well as Watashi's meeting with a fortune teller. This helps the viewer to keep a pace with the series, which may have been otherwise hard to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Yojouhan aren't really the focus point, but they aren't an afterthought by any means. While each member of the cast is a vibrant and distinctive individual in of themselves, the actual characterisation isn't really the strong point of the characters, but rather how they are used. Just like the story, each character and their actions throughout the two years are explained slightly more with each new perspective. This ends with more or less every character coming out good, but one character in particular sticks out as being an excellent example of defied expectations, showing their nature as a 3-dimensional character as we see their story from each side fall into place. I won't spoil who it is, but anybody who has seen the series should know who I mean. Watashi himself, while an unremarkable person, is hard not to like for his enjoyable musings and relatable situations, and as the series goes on he does develop well, if not remarkably so.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the time loops persist for as long as Watashi continues to miss the proper way to live the two years, with conclusions that have been dangling in front of his eyes the whole time. Some of the conclusions become expected after a mere few episodes, but other, more important ones (as well as the entire point of the time loops) are less obvious and yet no less excellent.\\n\\n\r\nYojouhan Shinwa Taikei is an exercise in series structure unlike anything before it. The way the entire series is built comes off as nothing short of genius. I have yet to see any of acclaimed director Yuasa Masaki's previous works, but Yojouhan makes it blatantly clear that he lives up to the reputation that precedes him. I can only hope Kaiba, Kemonozume and Mind Game are nearly as good as this, because now Masaki has set an excellent example of how to make a truly great, original anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 10/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Bakemonogatari, Welcome to the N.H.K!",

            "content": "I think I'm not in the wrong here when I say most of us have probably thought of the best way to live life at one time or another. That can mean what you want to be when you grow up, your dreams, ambitions, goals, what path you want to take, and what you envision it ending up life.\r\nTatami Galaxy's unnamed protagonist is one concerned with exactly that. In seek of that ideal life, he desperately repeats the first 2 years of his college life , searching for the \"rose-colored campus life\", and the \"raven-haired maiden\" that supposedly awaits him.\r\nIn doing so, he is ableto realize the complexity of humans, himself, what he really wants, and what it means to live life. It's very clear that this show is leashed to a strong central theme from the start, as the episodes repeat themselves over and over to drive its point home, and make the cathartic end that it builds up to all the more resonant.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, I think it's probably director Masaaki Yuasa's best piece, or at least my favorite of his. This is a show that can flash through 3 or 4 art styles in just a few seconds. Vibrant, volatile, and ever-changing with the moods, the visual direction seems to me like a reflection of the volatility of life itself. Something's always on the screen there to catch your eye. The use of real life shots is funny, as this is probably one of the wackiest yet most relatable shows I have ever found myself watching. \\n\\n\r\nI see quite a few people that often say this show is \"deep\" or whatnot. Well, maybe. I don't really agree, actually. There's plenty of people out there that drop this show without getting to the end, and they do mark it off as a \"2deep4u\" show. Honestly, they might just be a little less intelligent than the rest of us, because the idea behind Tatami Galaxy seems to be something very simple to me. Stop caring about the best way to live life, because you WILL lose yourself in pursuit of that \"rose-colored campus life\". In fact, you may have already found that fulfilling life already, but haven't realized it. From there on, all you've got to do is enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\\n\r\n10/10.",

            "content": "I watched Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei back in 2011. I was a noob and thought it was a masterpiece and the best thing ever. Recently, I rewatched it and came to realize that it was just the wannabe-elitist in me thinking this show is any good. It's basically the same as Sword Art Online, just the other end of the same shit-stick. \r\nThe story of this series is identical to Endless Eight from Suzumiya Haruhi S02. Only this time it is apparently meaningful and deep and provokes some thoughts in people. All I see is yet another teenage drama aimed for people who are lost inlife, executed in style over substance manner so people who wouldn't like it could just be told they didn't get it. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to this being like SAO, instead of focusing on an overpowered gary-stu isekai jesus who gets all the bitches and is best at everything he does, Tatami Galaxy focuses on a man who is practicing escapism in a timeloop and dwelling on self-pity. The main difference is the comfort which has changed from \"it's all good now\" to \"pretty much everyone else fucked it up too.\" Same shit-stick, same level of escapism, other end. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the worst part of this show. They are such an empty shells it's almost as if the viewer is supposed to put their own personality and buddies + high school crush in these shells and act like this is me. This is so me. Just like Kirito and his harem. \\n\\n\r\nBack in 2011, I thought Yuusa Masaki was god. A gift to the anime industry. After seeing everything he has ever done, I can only call him a try-hard attempt of being the next Satoshi Kon. So try-hard even Netflix wanted to hire the guy. Speak of mainstream appeal. Also, I am pretty sure this series was created for western weebs in purpose of trolling. Why else would a male main character be called Watashi instead of Boku.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei to 15-20 year old audience, this will help you feel less shit about your past mistakes and deal with them. Make sure to never rewatch this, tho, you will/might only come to see what I am now seeing.",

            "content": "J. D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\" despite being a novel intended for adults, in many ways laid the groundworks for the typical young adult story, where an above average intelligent teen tells about their life and problems, in a very self-conscious, humorously wanna-be literate way. Examples range from the now aging Adrian Mole books, to mostly anything by John Green, and the recent British film \"Submarine\". Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, or Tatami Galaxy, is also a rendition of this trope, though seemingly with a pinch of some hallucinogenic drug.\r\nThe never named main character's story of university level loneliness, as it happens, is told withabnormally badly drawn characters, weird color use and bits of live action. Which might have been interesting under some circumstances, but only comes across as obnoxious combined with the vapid story carrying it all. Already from the first episode it's quite clear how Tatami Galaxy is going to end. The main character yearns for some imagined, idealized version of his university days while ignoring the attractive, very cool girl who is obviously into him, and depreciating the friends he does have. In other words, not something unhappy people can actually relate to, but an excuse for pretty much 10 episodes of the main character trying out different social environments, before he finally realizes his own stupidity. Of course, perhaps I'm wrong in taking it seriously, and all this might instead be an excuse for fun, but the humor is very repetitive. Not only because it's mostly the main character's constant, manic narration which really stops being amusing after an episode, never being particularly funny in the first place, but also because most of the silly situations and their two-dimensional characters are repeated in different ways, often leaving little room in each short episode for new things. Perhaps this is the reason it takes the main character so long to see the truth of his situation.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a single word, I believe, which describes this anime perfectly, and sufficiently, though I'm a bit reluctant to use it because a lot of people tend to bring it up whenever something is ambitious at all. This is fairly ungood, because I love animes, or pieces of any kind of media that try to do something out of the ordinary. Tatami Galaxy on the other hand, truly is \"pretentious\". With its fancy animation, aimless literary references, crazy symbolism, purposeful yet irritating repetitions, and what have you, it certainly presumes a lot about itself, wants to be seen as different and smart, only to end the banal way it was obvious it would from the beginning, having done nothing sensible in the meantime. Tatami Galaxy is truly a case of much style and no substance.",

Yes, you should already understand that Tatami Galaxy holds no need for superficial or amazing concepts to be successful, just a realistic story executed in a masterful way.\r\nStory : 10 / 10 \"Masterful\"\r\nTatami Galaxy is set on a fictional universe, specifically a town, which seems pretty close to the modern Japanese towns. Our main character, Watashi, expects to find the rose colored campus life that he always dreamed of, entering a campus club. Instead, he finds mischief and disappointment inevery way possible.  Every time he joins a club, everything seem to go wrong and he ends up regretting his choice, wanting to go back to the moment of choosing it and reset his life by changing his choice. The plot is following his different choices and the different lifes he lived after them. Watashi begins a journey of self-discovery, where the weight of his choices matters the most, becoming a matured young man who lives his life with unlimited freedom but also respect on every choice. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9.1 / 10 \"Great\"\\n\\n\r\nThe show uses a minimalistic style that combines cartoonish graphics with no shading with a lot of live action film segments used in for quick depiction of areas with lots of background detail. Seen as poor by many, the art of Tatami Galaxy is gravely underrated. It effectively depicts the themes of the show, taking a realistic approach on many problems that college students face in Japan. Furthermore, it becomes very interesting when adding the psychological symbolisms included in the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9 / 10 \"Great\"\\n\\n\r\nA testament to the superb voice acting could be that, even though Watashi's speech is faster than a bullet train, he still manages to keep the viewer in his toes with his smart (and funny) take on many different subjects and make him feel whatever emotion he emits. As for the soundtrack, it fits great with the theme and mood of the series, succesfully representing the constant changes in atmosphere, from the melancholic \"Youjou han to Castella to Watashi\" to the mysterious \"Kamotaketsunuminogami\" and powerfully liberating \"Yojouhan Ki Owari\" or \"Takasegawa\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9.3 / 10 \"Great\"\\n\\n\r\nFrom the bullet-speed monologues of Watashi to the stoic and spiritual presence of Higuchi, the cast is the recipe for instant success. Watashi is a young college dropout who never seizes to amaze with his sarcastic and dark but witty dialogues on everything he analyzes. He is the source of the dialogues and monologues in Tatami Galaxy, and his themes vary from social commentary to self - sarcasm of the highest caliber. Ozu is another college student, dark and devilish character, who constantly drags Watashi to troubles. However, he has some hidden aspects which make him intriguing and three-dimensional. Akashi, a college student in the engineering department, is an adorable female character, and Watashi's biggest love interest. Higuchi is a stoic, and full with dreams on exploring the globe, character who is still a college student, even though he ,by far, had exceeded the minimum years of studying there. He also has many hidden sides, which made him mysterious, spiritual and occasionally wise. There are more characters that are also very interesting, but doesn't quite measure up to the other mentioned above. However, there is not a single character that is not likeable in this series, because of his quirks and personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10 / 10 \"Masterful\"\\n\\n\r\nI fully enjoyed every minute of Watashi's attempts to reach a rose-colored campus life, his moments of self-discovery and liberation scenes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nVerdict : 9.5 / 10 \"Masterpiece\"\\n\\n\r\nWhen simple but meaningful premises meets innovative and unique storytelling methods, a show like Tatami Galaxy is born. Excluding or changing only one component of the Tatami Galaxy's recipe would result in losing it's eternal glowing. \\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing more boring than reading a review, so give yourself the chance to watch this exquisite show. You will not regret it.",

            "content": "Beware, spoiler-ish review.\r\nIt is a given that choices are very important for all of us, for just a minute of thought or two can change the outcome of many things in our lives, that be a relationship, that be a friendship, that be our well-being, anything I dare say. Before going to sleep, I personally reminisce of my actions, coming from my choices, which in turn come from my thoughts, and make a conclusion as of whether these actions were the right thing to do for myself. Ever thought of how much of a toll a choice can take in your life? Additionally, have youever thought of something depicting that matter of fact in a way that is both gripping, personal and goosebumps-inducing? That is what The Tatami Galaxy did to me. It touched me so much, I could relate to it in such a manner, that I now consider it my favorite anime series of all time, something that is irreplaceable for me. Coming from the hands of an insanely experienced director in Japanimation, who specialises in style over substance shows, Masaaki Yuasa, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is an expectional coming-of-age show like no other, which takes such an everyday, simple, common concept that everyone of us has given a glimpse of thought on, and unravels it through some of the most ingenious executions I have ever encountered in any work of fiction.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is about a college student without a name (shall be referred to as Watashi from now on), who is lonely and considers himself as one of the most unlucky people in the world. As he eats in a ramen stand named Neko Ramen, he stumbles upon a self-proclaimed god of martimony, who decides the pairings between men and women during the Kannazuki Festival in Izumo, his name being Higuchi Seitarou (or Kamotaketsunominokamo duh). Through a conversation he has with him, Watashi starts reminiscing of his past two years in college, through his misadventures with his only friend Ozu, with whom he spends time trying to break up couples in the college in the first episode, because he has nothing else to do, blaming Ozu for coming close to him and for ruining his life. By the way, Ozu looks like a ghoul, and that is of importance. Amongst the chaos, a love interest of Watashi's appears, Akashi, who is cold and introverted, yet shows some interest when it comes to Watashi. He tries confessing to her quite a lot of times throughout the series, all of them failing because of reasons. Other side characters are present as well, including an english-loving perverted dentist, a dude who has a doll fetish, the doll itself, a god of martimony as said earlier, the leader of the Secret Society Chinese Restaurant, the Cleanup Corps, a girl that Watashi exchanges letter with, etc. After Watashi fails on doing something, or even when he himself thinks that he did not leave up to his own expectations (due to not himself as he says, but due to other people and mainly Ozu), he goes back to the start of his college years, that indicated with the backdrop of a clock or, well, many clocks, and starts his college years with a different club, interchangeable events yet mostly the same people and him remembering some things from the other timelines as he experiences them in the timeline he is in, kinda like deja-vu.\\n\\n\r\nBefore moving on, I would like to clarify something. Please do not take the time travel plot device literally and in a realistic manner, because it is meant to be played with. Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is after all a surrealistic unorthodox anime series, so the plot device exists for a different reason than expected, and that is to present a really important message.       Consequently, each episode serves as a piece of the puzzle, all of them creating an allegory which is one of a kind. Yes, the entirety of The Tatami Galaxy serves as an allegory through the different timelines, which I would call metaphors, each of them including some basic and easy to understand symbols, examples being the mochiguman and the moths, which are utilized to the fullest. All that to answer a very simple concept, the one of life choices and their outcome. That is what this anime series does perfectly, it plays with its devices and creates a two-episode wrap up which is nothing short of a miracle for me personally, really. Simple metaphors, simple allegory, perfect everything.\\n\\n\r\nTo get on with the characters, Watashi shall be first. Watashi is that dude who has many expectations of his life and is very optimistic, him being the embodiment of before-coming-of-age idealism, and once he finds out that life is not that rose-coloured and that raven-haired maidens will not swarm before him, he starts blaming others and does not accept that he himself is looking too far ahead and that the world is not full of butterflies and flowers. It takes him quite some time to understand that he is the one at fault, and that he does not grab opportunities in order to be single-handedly happy. The most interesting part of Watashi would be his name indeed. Why is his name Watashi, which means \"I\"? That is because Watashi is open for self-insert. He is a character that us watchers can relate with really easily, not for just what he lives through, not by just understanding him and his flaws, but by adding ourselves in the story, with our own flaws, with our own character, with our own problems. After all, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is not a story itself, it tells a story, a story of Watashi and his coming-of-age, so why not adding yourself in turn and making it more relatable, productive and interesting? \\n\\n\r\nOzu is undoubtedly the most enigmatic figure of the whole series, presented as a black cupid, as the character who's connected with Watashi through the black thread of fate, as a curse in Watashi's eyes, as a ghoul. He indeed is a clever and troublesome creature, but he is one who admittedly would accept Watashi and who would always be close to him and help him, making his life adventurous in turn. Ozu is the person that Watashi must accept in order for him to come to terms with himself and try out a different approach in life, completely different from what he was trying to do all the time. An interesting thing about Ozu is his face. Why is he like a ghoul? The reasons might be plenty, but I somehow narrowed it out. Ozu might like that because that is how Watashi perceives him to be. Watashi believes that Ozu has an ugly soul, that he is a bad person that wants to make him suffer just to have fun, though of course that is not the case. To put it bluntly, Ozu's face is a personification of how Watashi feels about him in the start. That can be justified due to them swapping faces in the last seconds of the series, meaning that Ozu viewed Watashi as a black cupid then. \\n\\n\r\nAkashi is yet another interesting character in the Tatami Galaxy. She has a cold demeanor and does not express herself most of the times, but she seems more open when it comes to Watashi. Another reason is the thing that she is Watashi's love interest. Despite not appearing a lot in the series, as it mostly revolves around Watashi, it can be observed that she does care about him, and quite a lot at that. She is the observant type, and takes action in episode 8 as well, where she is asked to be the one Watashi exchanges letters with. Therefore, she is one that wants Watashi to develop and understand more things about what a happy life is and where it might lead. It is heavily hinted that by the end, Akashi ends up with Watashi, them going to Neko Ramen as he had promised in previous episodes, and him returning the Mochiguman to her. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters by all means defy certain archetypes, as they all are quite unique to say the least. A fellow with a doll fetish is always fun to watch, the three episode arc with Watashi and the three women being the most hilarious thing I have ever watched in animated form. The side characters mostly serve as means for Watashi to develop, as well as comedic elements, and successful ones at that. After all, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei has a large portion of dark comedy through Watashi's fast-paced monologues, which also serve as great social commentary and which, for the lack of a better term, are funny as heck. Many kinds of comedy are included in the story, including slapstick, which is successful as well, despite slapstick not working out in other series and being a complete miss. Johnny's usage throughout some episodes is also of significance as well, him being a metaphor to Watashi's sexual urges and worries. The scenes including Johnny teh Cowboi and his horse always were really funny, to the point of finding myself bursting out laughing without second notice.\\n\\n\r\nIn each different timeline, Watashi joins different clubs. In some others, the series does not focus on the clubs he has entered, but on his romance anxieties and interests. In episodes 1-3, he enters the Tennis, Film and Cycling associations, episode 4 is about the proxy wars and Watashi and Ozu's place in them, episode 5 goes back to the way episodes 1-3 were done with a Softball circle, and episodes 6-8 are about him joining some circles, but mostly about him and the three love interests of his, apart from Akashi (though Akashi is one of them in disguise but that is another matter). Episode 9 is about the mysterious Chinese Restaurant circle, and episodes 10-11 serve as the wrap-up of each and every episode of the series, Watashi coming into conclusions and realizations and completing his development and coming-of-age. With that being the case, you might think that the first 9 episodes are pointless, but that is in no way true. Letting alone that each and every episode has underlying and self-sufficient themes, examples being unrequited love, consumerism and the use of personality masks, what the first 9 episodes manage to do is building raw connection between the viewer and the main character, as well as something really fun and wacky to follow. It is a matter of fact that it is the journey that matters and that leads things into a conclusion which is not of as much importance as the journey itself after all. Trials and tribulations are made, but the conclusion is happy plus cathartic plus ambitious.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values work greatly, in a way that I can not imagine the series working out in another way when it comes to how it looks. The artstyle is really unique, really unorthodox, changes depending on the moods, is extremely detailed, vibrant and variable. It also adds to the comedy, because of the dumb faces and the funny reactions of our main character because of what he is going through. It is natural that it might turn someone off by its start, because it is an artstyle that is not that dominant in the medium, especially for the newcomers, but it is easy to get used to after one or two episodes, and it is even easier to realise how unique it is in a great way afterwards. The animation is also detailed, includes live-action shots and scenes to add to the realism of the concept, the movements feel natural and it is generally something great to watch and behold.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really strong as well, and about my favorite part in all the show is included here, that being the opening. The opening is so fun to listen to, it has some of the greatest background music I have ever set my ears on and, most importantly, the lyrics are godly. And they spoil the whole show. Such connection with lyrics of a song have I never shown aside from the Tatami Galaxy's opening. Its title is \"Maigoinu no Ame to Beat\", a title that fits incredibly well to the theme of the series, by Asian Kung-fu Generation, who never disappoint me with their work in opening songs. Their songs also include Boku Dake ga Inai Machi's opening, Re:Re:, which is the best part of the whole show. The ending song of Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is tremendously good as well, sang by one of my favorite and most unique singers in the japanimation medium, Etsuko Yakushimaru, who also sang the first opening of Mawaru Penguindrum, which is also godly. Fun and unique to listen to, her songs always impress. The OST is, by all means, goosebumps-inducing. I am amazed at how each song fits the scene it represents, and also going to give a round of applause to sound director plus the creator of the OST of the series, for making it as strongly present as it is throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly did I enjoy The Tatami Galaxy to the fullest. Having watched it many times, it is the piece that I feel is the one that was meant for me, it is like fate had its hand into my connection between me and the series, a masterpiece. It is nothing short of a masterpiece in my opinion. I laughed a lot, I cried a whole lot, I felt a connection I have never felt in any other kind of series, in any other kind of medium, it is nothing short of a miracle for me, this series. Thank you Yuasa, thank you for bestowing the anime industry and especially myself with such a present. Amazing, spectacular, cathartic, ambitious, goosebumps-inducing, emotional, hilarious, genuine. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLetting my bias aside, The Tatami Galaxy is a series that everyone should check out. Right off the bat, I am gonna decline it being called \"deep\". What is deep is the execution, not the anime itself in heart. On the inside, the Tatami Galaxy is human, it is so true that it hurts, it is so simple that everyone can understand it if he or her focuses on it just a bit. Simple yet complex. Over-the-top yet down-to-the-earth in its true form. That is what the Tatami Galaxy is. And it is nothing short of a work that should be considered a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nNote: Sorry for being biased. This review comes from the bottom of my heart, I hope you will understand where I am coming from. Thanks a lot for reading, it means much.",

            "content": "The idea of perfection is something that, I believe, not any piece of media has been able to attain, and that makes sense. Nothing is 'truly perfect' and every piece of media, no matter how great that product actually is, will still have flaws in one way or another and this philosophy also applies when I give tens to shows. When I do so, I don't reward an anime a ten because I believe it is perfect. I reward a ten to an anime that does the most good or is a shining example of what the medium is capable of. The Tatami Galaxy isone such example of this. A show that perfectly conveys the power of the medium and all of the limitless possibilities it contains, this show, despite the medium's tropes and cliches, still remains an anime unbound by genre convention and is oozing with so much creativity, charm and great writing that it has become my personal favourite anime of all time! A such, I apologise in advance if I sound like I'm being a little too biased throughout this review, but I absolutely adore this show! Everything from the characters to the narrative is handled with such care that it's hard to for me to even articulate properly into words, but, alas, I will god damn try! This, ladies and gentlemen, is The Tatami Galaxy in a 4.5 tatami mat nutshell: (pssst, only those who have seen the show will get the reference!)\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy has a rather unconventional narrative structure, which, at first, did put me off from even watching the show. The show stars a nameless protagonist, who attends college for the first time hoping, as he himself puts it, for a rose-coloured campus life. At the end of each episode, the clock goes back once again and essentially resets the whole episode, back to when the main character starts college once again. Each episode pretty much starts out in the same fashion but in every story, the main character joins a brand new club, meets new people and each episode is just a small segment in a much larger picture and narrative. In one episode, the show may begin one story thread which will be connected later on in another episode while, at the same time, systematically resolving older narrative threads established in previous episodes. Now, I'll admit, that it did take me time to accept this fact and structure, but thankfully each episode is vibrant enough and distinct enough to work by itself and the constant juxtaposition of endings and resolutions to each episode felt fresh, original and the entire show has a very addicting and fast-paced nature about it. There is always this lingering sense of desire to know what happens next and to fully understand this crazy world we have been pushed into and this is part of the fun of The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the appeal of this anime is trying to figure everything out as we watch more and more of the show leading up to the most satisfying conclusion I have ever seen in which everything gets brought together in such a neat and tidy way while also making complete sense at the same time. This sense of satisfaction is only enhanced on my repeated viewings of the show. The more and more times I watch The Tatami Galaxy, the more I am able to pick up on small details and thus, I appreciate the ending even more than I did the first time around. Not only that, but the show's pace, as mentioned before, is crazy. If you've ever seen the Bakemonogatari franchise in which its characters speak about five hundred lines a minute, then you already have an idea about the pace at which the Tatami Galaxy goes. The characters speak so fast in this show and dish out so much comedy and wit that it can be hard at times to keep up, but I believe this is one of its strengths. The insane pace and nature of the show mirrors real life too, and, in particular, how fast your college life will zoom by. As someone who has only two weeks of college left myself, this theme in particular, and the way the show is structured speaks volumes to me personally and is one of my favourite things about this show. \\n\\n\r\nPart of the anime's charm is in its wit, metaphorical line delivery and meaning. The entire script is loaded to the brim with clever jokes, play on words and the character interactions is by far the most entertaining aspect of this show. The internal monologues the main character has are both so funny and relatable to anybody wanting to fit in while attending school, that it's genuinely charming. The comedy is easily the strongest part of this show, and I believe it's a show that gets funnier the more you age and the more cynical you become. It invites you to laugh at the ridiculous situations everyone encounters in their day to day life and all of the clubs the main character joins each brings something new to the table and each has their own unique gags and jokes which never made the show feel as if it were repetitive. Complementing this story is a varied and likeable cast of characters, all of which are unique in terms of designs and personality. My personal favourite being Ozu, the main character's, sort of, friend out of circumstance who seems to be out just to make our protagonist's life a living nightmare. The fact that we never even learn the name of our protagonist just goes to show how well written this anime is since he is still so endearing and entertaining to watch on account of how relatable he is.\\n\\n\r\nDescribing The Tatami Galaxy is a rather difficult thing to do considering how experimental everything is and how it combines so many different genres together into one blender; it's a show that's best to be experienced by the viewer on their own. It has elements of being a love story, but not really. At the same time, it is also a coming of age story but presented through surrealism and comedy. What's great about the show is how all of these elements and genre staples never feel forced or intrusive on any other areas of the show. The show combines them all together and presents them in such a colourfully, creative way that it comes across as so charming and lovable while allowing each respective element time to develop. For example, the love story, despite being fragmented due to the nature of the show, has a genuine sense of progression during its run while also never feeling too overbearing or soppy. Adding to the wacky nature of the show is one of the most unique and vibrant art styles in the medium. Everything pops out at you and the visuals are wonderful, conveying the emotions of the characters in interesting ways. My favourite being the scenes in which the main character speaks to his penis, who he calls 'Johnny'. 'Johnny' is presented as a cowboy on a horse and this makes for some very creative and very funny comedy, and the whole show is like this! The music is also superb, and I LOVE the ending and opening tracks! Two of my favourite pieces of music in the entire medium. The show has a very distinct art style which is oozing with style, creativity and colour, and much of it feels very much like a pop-art piece of art. The animation and art style is endless imaginative which brings this vibrant world to life; it feels very postmodern and experimental, but, in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as I said in the opening paragraph, nothing is truly perfect, and this also applies to The Tatami Galaxy. There were a few moments that I felt were kind of weak and some moments that were just straight out boring, in particular episode ten. In addition, watching the show can also be highly tiring due to the fast nature of the show, but these elements were few and far in between and everything I have praised makes up for it. The Tatami Galaxy is a strange show but one brimming with personality, fantastic dialogue and a great cast of characters. It fully shows us what the medium is capable of and is by far, one of the greatest anime out there. It also goes to show that an anime doesn't have to have a complicated narrative or be buried underneath deep and thought provoking themes. If anything, this series plays it rather safe with its themes and narrative thematics. It's a series that, while certainly not everyone will like, anyone can understand after their initial watch of the series. And that, is one of the reasons why I love this show so much. Madhouse proves once again why they're one of the best anime studios out there and I wish them all the luck on future projects in the future. I would highly recommend this show (if it weren't obvious at this point). As a final side note as well, the series has finally been licensed and as such, I decided to go ahead and purchase the collector's edition, which has a ton of awesome posters, making-of books and title cards. If you're a big fan of the series yourself, I would highly recommend buying this too!",

The narrator speaks in a very very fast manner, making a lot of his narration unintelligible. Even with the subtitles on, it was very difficult to follow. I thought after a few episodes I would adapt to the pace, but unfortunately it did not happen. \r\nMy second problem with this anime was the amount of repetition. As the protagonist relives some of his days with a difference going from slight to more pronounced. But I grew tiredof this rather quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe third problem was the visuals : some may like the color palette, or the character design which I can only describe as minimalist.

            "content": "There isn\u2019t much to Tatami Galaxy. A nameless protagonist, here by referred to as Watashi, wants another chance at a \u201crose colored campus life with a raven haired maiden\u201d. Through mystical means he is granted the opportunity to do so, thus beginning his journey for that rose colored campus life he so desperately wants though it might just be right in front of him. With such a setup there are not many places to go, and Tatami Galaxy quickly finds itself trapped. \r\n Most episodes follow the same structure of Watashi joining a club in order to reach his goal and falling justshort of it due to his \"friend\" Ozu\u2019s schemes. In his defeats Watashi gets closer and closer to asking out his main love interest Akashi but fails to do so and the cycle starts again. Throughout the series Watashi fails to pursue many different opportunities which can become quite tiresome. Granted, that\u2019s the point of the story but taking the \u201cget in the damn robot\u201d scene from Evangelion and stretching it out into an entire series is arguably not a good idea to begin with. When a story presents its ending in the first episode it becomes even more reliant on the journey there to be fulfilling or subvert expectations. Tatami Galaxy manages to do neither and instead we get eleven frustrating episodes of silly misadventures and while some of it can be entertaining it is mostly just pointless and meandering, ultimately adding nothing to the forgone conclusion.\\n\\n\r\n Tatami Galaxy desperately tries to be quirky and relatable to the point where it's off putting. Within the first five minutes of Tatami Galaxy we have obnoxiously fast narrations where the main character just complains about his life, a man with a huge chin slurping down noodles, and some fucker that looks like an onion. It\u2019s a lot to take in right from the start, and anyone who doesn\u2019t see the humor in the spastic and hyper active style Tatami Galaxy offers is in for a very long ride.  \\n\\n\r\n The attempts at making the characters relatable just makes them unlikable. The protagonist is a nameless college student who is completely average, filled with regrets, and in general is lost when it comes to life and love. Aren't we all. Despite the eye rolling lack of subtly the story manages to even mess that up as the main character is more like that one friend who has a personal problem where everyone else knows the solution but he just keeps bitching about not knowing what to do despite being told over and over again. It is unflattering in real life and not any better here unless you like cheap self inserts instead of characters.  \\n\\n\r\n The rest of the characters are just as irritating and why Watashi is even friends with some of these people is beyond me. Ozu fucks him over on a constant basis and seems to be actively working against him. Higuchi is some hipster who likes to hang out with younger kids for some reason. Hanuki is a cock tease who Watashi is too much of an... anime character to fuck her even when she isn't being a cock tease  and is throwing pussy at him. Akashi isn\u2019t much better as they try to portray her as the witty \u201cnot like the other girls\u201d type of character one would see in a bad indie romantic comedy but she ends up coming off as just kind of cunty. In fact, the whole series in general just reminds me of a more arthouse version of a bad romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\n The only thing I got out of Tatami Galaxy that was a unique experience was being fairly annoyed despite not feeling incredibly passionate about the show in either a bad or good way. When a story amounts to \u201csad guy goes back to college\u201d with the most painfully obvious ending possible there has to be more than just quirky bullshit, Sword Art Online tier pandering, and clich\u00e9 messages about life that any well-adjusted person already knows. Unfortunately for Tatami Galaxy there isn\u2019t anything more and it ends up empty, leaving me yelling \u201cGet in the damn dentist, Watashi!\u201d.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nThere\u2019s no such thing as a perfect anime; everybody knows that. Due to the fact that different human beings value very different things across all mediums of art, it is impossible to create a work that everybody will agree is flawless. However, there IS such a thing as an anime that could not possibly be more effective in the delivery of its narrative, characters, animation, themes, and soundtrack under the given circumstances; an anime that is as close to perfect as you can possibly get. That anime is called The Tatami Galaxy. There is little debate among those who have indulged in thisbrilliant creation that The Tatami Galaxy is an absolute masterpiece. It\u2019s the hardest anime to criticize simply because it\u2019s thematically bulletproof; the only possible criticisms that can be made of it boil down to personal preference and what YOU may or may not be partial to on a subjective level.  Now, if all that is true, why has barely anyone seen this show? If it was THAT great, why isn\u2019t it overwhelmingly popular? Well, the answer to that question supremely unjust, but unfortunately true: The Tatami Galaxy is very experimental. The reason you may not have even heard of this little gem before is because not everyone is going to be into its one-of-a-kind style or use of literary devices. However, even if you aren\u2019t fond of its art direction or narrative presentation, it\u2019s hard to refute that this is one of the greatest anime ever made. It accomplishes everything it ever set out to do with the utmost of ease and grace. It sets ambitious and perhaps unreasonable goals and then proceeds to effortlessly meet them. Presenting the most horrifyingly under-watched anime in history: The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: A college dropout stops for a late night meal at his favorite ramen stand. There, he crosses paths with the self-proclaimed \u201cgod of matrimony\u201d. This bizarre meeting sends the young man hurtling through a horrifying flashback to his not-so-glorious college days as he is forced to reflect upon where it all went wrong for him.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy\u2019s plot is essentially a far better written and much artsier version the movie Groundhog Day; the protagonist is forced to relive his college days over and over and over again, with each iteration ending in his complete and utter misery. However, in addition to providing the same level of comedy, this anime also manages to be overwhelmingly meaningful, brutally thought provoking, and nihilistically sobering. The Tatami Galaxy may seem like an innocent comedy with a fancy art style up until the last couple episodes, but make no mistake; this anime has so much explicit detail to it that it\u2019s almost scary. It can only be described an absolute bombardment of symbols, themes, motifs, and imagery that you likely didn\u2019t even notice until the final episodes, if you noticed it at all. For that reason, it is essentially mandatory to rewatch this show in order to truly get everything out of it, because you WILL be overwhelmed. It\u2019s supposed to feel that way.\\n\\n\r\nBut what EXACTLY is this show about? Well, it\u2019s about a lot of things. Namely, it\u2019s about having respect for the choices you have made in your life and understanding the you need to take the good with the bad; there is no perfect, fairy-tale life style out there waiting for you. The message of this show is relatable to virtually everyone, but especially so for college students, considering that a university campus is the setting of The Tatami Galaxy. There are so many people out there who feel like they have lost their way or don\u2019t know what they are doing with their life, stressing out over every single situation, agonizing over the fact that they can never achieve the \u201crose-colored\u201d life they are so desperate to experience. Put simply, this is the story of man who is finding his way in life and discovering what it truly is to be happy. It\u2019s both a charming, heart-warming tale and a realist\u2019s harsh reality complete with the ups and downs that everyone can relate to. That\u2019s why everyone should watch it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you HAD to put The Tatami Galaxy into a genre, it\u2019s honestly closest to a comedy. Now, with that in mind, everybody knows that the most important aspect of a comedy (besides, well\u2026 the comedy) is the cast of characters. This puts The Tatami Galaxy in an interesting predicament, because its characters don\u2019t serve nearly the same roles that they might serve in a more traditional comedy. Rather, the characters in this show are all symbols. Our protagonist, for example, doesn\u2019t even have a name. The novel that this anime is based on (as in a REAL novel, not a light or visual novel) simply refers to him as \u201cWatashi\u201d, which makes the symbolism quite obvious. The rest of the cast, including Watashi\u2019s love interest Akashi and his best friend Ozu are also allegorical, but I won\u2019t go into detail on the subject for the sake of time and spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes The Tatami Galaxy\u2019s characters so masterful is that not only do they execute their symbolic roles so masterfully, they also manage to have likable, charming personalities and add a lot of comedy to the show. While Watashi is without a doubt the most prominent and dynamic character, the side characters serve a purpose that is just as important: an emotional anchor. From episode to episode, seemingly everything around Watashi (i.e the eyes of the viewer) changes. His environment, his mental state, his hobbies, his pastimes, etc. all fluctuate superfluously, which can get chaotic. The only things we have as an audience to anchor us to reality, as in the only things that seem to NOT change episodically, are the side characters. Jougasaki\u2019s eccentricities, Akashi\u2019s hilarious fear of moths, and of course: Johnny. All of them serve as the only constants in an ever-changing world, and this technique was executed to perfection. By the end of the show, you feel like you personally know each and every character, particularly Watashi. Dare I say that you may feel as if you know him as well as you know yourself? In short, everything about this cast amazing; I can\u2019t picture them being done any better.\\n\\n\r\nThe last wave of praise that I must pile upon this masterpiece is in regards to its one of a kind presentation. In terms of animation, there is NOTHING out there that\u2019s even remotely comparable to The Tatami Galaxy. Not only does it use a wide variety of techniques, (including rotoscoping, which is seldom scene in the medium), it gets the absolute most out of them and creates a visually stunning product that you will never forget. Masaaki Yuasa is an absolute GENIUS. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING about this show\u2019s visuals are flawlessly executed. Not only does it look good, it\u2019s extremely fluent and meaningful. The Tatami Galaxy is perhaps the best example we\u2019ve ever seen of visual storytelling and using animation to convey meaning without words, and that\u2019s saying quite a lot. As for the soundtrack, I couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more fitting. From jazz to soft rock to tracks that simply transcend genres, the OST never fails to set the mood, whether it be depression, hope, happiness, or anything else. Have I mentioned that both the OP and ED sequences are superbly directed and consist of fantastic songs in general? On a final note, I must point out that Shintaro Asanuma delivered what I consider to be one of the most impressive voice acting performances of all time as the character of Watashi. The speed, clarity, and tone in which he speaks is so alluring and impressive, which merely contributes to this show\u2019s overall top-notch ability to present its story.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, watch the Tatami Galaxy. You owe it to yourself as a fan of anime to witness arguably the premiere model of what the medium is truly capable of. It\u2019s not for everyone, you might not love the art style, and you may not understand it the first time you watch it, but make no mistake: Those who are able and willing to digest the Tatami Galaxy will never forget it. The anime industry has never seen anything like it and it will never see anything like it again. This is without a doubt the finest example of how quality does not correlate with popularity. In case you take nothing else out of this review: WATCH. THIS. SHOW.",

            "content": "From the critically acclaimed director Masaaki Yuasa comes an anime that defies the definition of conventional: The Tatami Galaxy provides a ride full of twists and turns, rewinds and jumps through time. Beautifully crafted and imbued with a comedic touch, The Tatami Galaxy explodes with energy, ultimately forming a dense and complex narrative that serves as the embodiment of good directing. Indeed, The Tatami Galaxy proves that animation is a viable medium in terms of both storytelling and visual appeal.\r\n\tUpon first glance, what do you notice? Chances are it\u2019s the art style. Similar to Yuasa\u2019s previous works, The Tatami Galaxy features a unique, anomalous, butyet simple art style that never fails to evoke a sort of anger towards Yuasa among some anime fans, for many claim that they watch anime to get away from this very style; however, The Tatami Galaxy\u2019s art style reasserts the classic saying that less is indeed more. The style itself is brimming with simplicity; characters are bestowed with one shading at all times, only the most dominant features are depicted, while chins, ears, adam\u2019s apples, collarbones and other aspects of the body are forgotten, leaving the characters themselves appearing very flimsy, curvy and far from dynamic. \\n\\n\r\n\tHow, you may ask, does this advocate the fact that less is more? For those of you unaware of the mechanics behind the animation process, animators must draw a character numerous times, bearing the same proportions and details as the previous sketch. As a result of this, many animators spend their time copying over details from the preceding drawing rather than creating a sense of flow between them. On the contrary, The Tatami Galaxy\u2019s simple style allows the animators to portray actions more fluidly and regularly than other shows. The condensed style is much faster to draw, and so the animators are given a chance to work without restraint, and that is absolutely what they do. Characters ricochet across the screen, a plethora of objects move at once, still frames are very limited, and unlike many other anime, budget does not act as a confinement for imagination. \\n\\n\r\n\tI would also like to point out that, from a cinematic standpoint, this anime is incredibly well put together. Transitions between scenes flow brilliantly and scene composition is done with great expertise. I wouldn\u2019t be exaggerating if I said that The Tatami Galaxy is easily one of the most visually appealing works of animation that have ever graced this earth. \\n\\n\r\n\tDoes the theme of less being greater than more desist after moving away from the topic of art and animation? Well, not entirely. As the story progresses, or rather regresses, the characters are shown in varying situations that range from sad, hilarious to downright over the top. Rather than taking the time to elaborate as to what the character\u2019s roots are, the show uses its recursive nature to build the character\u2019s personalities and give them a good portion of depth. The characters themselves are all very likable and are drawn very smoothly. I especially enjoyed Ozu\u2019s antithetical antics and Akashi\u2019s icy yet affectionate attitude. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe stunning visuals are not the only thing The Tatami Galaxy has going for it; the voice actors pack great amounts of effort, emotion, and in some cases, speed, into their roles. The background music is also similar to the previously analysed categories in the sense that it follows the \u2018less is more\u2019 rule of the show. The Tatami Galaxy is at times silent, while at others calmingly quiet, but the rare fast-paced ensembles never fail to produce a sense of excitement and urgency in the viewer. The composer and sound directors working on this show deserve a great amount of kudos for their excellent work. \\n\\n\r\n\tLastly, I will assess the plot of The Tatami Galaxy. Ordinarily, I would deconstruct the plot of an anime first and foremost, but coincidentally, this is far from an ordinary anime. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe story follows its nameless protagonist as he searches for love. In an attempt to find his raven-haired goddess and attain the rose-colored campus life he had been dreaming of, he joins a multitude of extra-curricular activities, but the majority of his efforts are for naught. He denies the reality that has been set out before him, and time rewinds back to the day he first joined college, only giving him yet another opportunity to follow one of the endless contingencies awaiting him.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe plot gives the viewer room to guess what\u2019s going on \u2013 it allows them to speculate why time resets, how each individual episode correlate with one another, and the nature of the protagonist\u2019s recursive campus life, or to even ponder the possibility of no recursion at all. Rather than taking the viewer for a ride, The Tatami Galaxy lets the viewer create their own ride, then continues to enhance said ride into a rollercoaster. \\n\\n\r\n\tOverall, The Tatami Galaxy is a brilliantly put together anime brimming with creativity and originality. Like its predecessors, The Tatami Galaxy is filled with Yuasa\u2019s postmodern madness and humor, giving the viewer food for thought and a good laugh at the same time. I\u2019m usually very hesitant to give an anime, or anything in particular, the title of a masterpiece, but I believe that this show deserves no less than that. It is for that reason that I give The Tatami Galaxy all 10s across the board.\\n",

            "content": "This analytical review of The Tatami Galaxy spoils the entirety of the series and is thus advised for those who have completed the series.\r\nNotes: \r\n-The protagonist shall be referred to as Watashi.\r\n-The Tatami Galaxy shall be abbreviated as TTG.\r\nEpisode summaries:\r\nEpisode numbers will be referenced frequently in this review, so for the sake of easy reference, the episodes will be described briefly\r\nEpisode 1: Parallel world setup, romance setup, Mochiguman setup, suspense of why Ozu was chased by a mob at the end of the episode.\r\nEpisode 2: Watashi's movies; sabotaging Jogasaki;  Akashi asking that Watashi make his dream movie about true love between those tied byfate, unbounded by even gender come true. \\n\r\nEpisode 3: Watashi training for the birdman, how it contributed to his downfall, Icarus allusion,  Higuchi winning with Watashi's bike. \\n\r\nEpisode 4: Prank episode between Jogasaki and Higuchi, money that Watashi obtained to buy the tortoise toothbrush placed by the final Watashi from the tatami room.\\n\r\nEpisode 5: Watashi's pitfall in seeking health food and it actually making him more unhealthy,  tie to Ozu stealing the blimp, final Watashi appearing in front of current Watashi at the end.\\n\r\nEpisode 6-8: Choosing between three women arc.\\n\r\nEpisode 9: Ozu's romantic desires revealed, Watashi's slump in pursuing absolute pleasure.\\n\r\nEpisode 10: Tatami Room; parallel worlds reveal.  \\n\r\nEpisode 11: final message and conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nRefresher  terms:\\n\r\nMochiguman: Akashi's plush toy constantly dangling as an opportunity for Watashi.\\n\r\nCastella: The cake Watashi is seen eating on his own various times.\\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of a great, simple story lies in the technicalities: symbolism, subtleties, narrative ties and novel storytelling methods. As a great story is one that requires effort to craft,  paying heed to all the little details  is the push a simple story needs to match a well-done story with more complexity. The Tatami Galaxy (TTG)  is a great example of a simple story done quite well, with symbolism to pick apart, narratives ties to sort through, and well handling of its ideas.\\n\\n\r\nTTG's story is built upon contrivances, namely a time loop format, every episode a discrete loop serving for the sake of the final message. For some, these contrivances could be accused of either being inappropriate or lazy for such a simple story. However, to dismiss the series for its approach would be erroneously dogmatic when investigating the story's execution. We must instead examine how well it lived up to the type of story it tried to be.\\n\\n\r\nFor Tatami Galaxy's premise to reach its potential, I propose that it would need to do the following:\\n\\n\r\n1. Showcase the various facets through which the rose-colored campus life can be sought and the pitfalls of these approaches.\\n\r\n2. Provide a concluding message regarding the pursuit of the rose-colored campus life.\\n\r\n3. Reveal more about the characters by examining them through different scenarios, sides, angles.\\n\r\n4. Display how the various scenarios are related together, since the parallel universes are different sides of the same reality.\\n\r\n5. Remain engaging, fresh, and varied despite the repetitive nature\\n\r\n6. Establish foreshadowing and suspense to reveal the mechanics of the \"resets\" and its final message.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this analysis, we shall conclude how well TTG fits into these criteria.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the presentation is done well: the character designs are varied and expressive, Watashi's lightning fast monologues help give the show identity, and the visuals are pleasing. Most importantly, it effectively utilizes symbolism and recurring elements. The changing and varied colors help signify how each of the different worlds has its own color, though none are rose-colored. The repetition of the fortune-teller gag provides the viewer with something to anticipate; one will always be wondering when and how the fortune-teller is brought up. The clock symbolism is an effective motif to wrap up an episode and to maintain interest for the next one. Seeing the various ways Ozu is portrayed or introduced, and the visual representation he's given (being portrayed as a devil to mirror Watashi's perception of him) is a nice touch for engagement. The Mochiguman serves as consistent build-up to the climax. Even something minor such as the song Higuchi sings in episode 5 leads to the overall message of the story, through the line \"Search for the circle, to learn how to not become a circle.\" The castella is meant to be shared, yet Watashi always eats it, portraying his isolation; poignant when Watashi consumes it excessively in the final episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAn interesting motif of note is the moth. At first glance, it would seem the moths serve only to characterize Akashi, but their presence in Watashi's room suggests greater relevance. Moths are an antithetical motif to butterflies\u2014diametrically opposed to the butterfly effect is the eminent idea that vastly different events lead yet to one end. Throughout the different episodes, we get those various recurring elements, and Watashi's faliure to achieve the rose-colored campus life is present in each of them.  Higuchi claiming victory in the episode 3 and 4 bike races regardless of Watashi's presence further supports this reverse butterfly effect.  One can also read the moths as representing pitiful creatures, trapped by their tendency to flock to a light source, thus meeting a tragic fate akin to Icarus, whom the series references in episode 3. One can further read how their connection to  metamorphosis is intertwined with their role in freeing Watashi from the Tatami Room. But I shall not dwell upon these routes of analysis, as I cannot do them justice. \\n\\n\r\nNow, let us examine the structure of TTG, and how it's used for both foreshadowing and narrative ties. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 introduces us to the initiation of the alternate scenarios and of Watashi's promise to Akashi. It also builds suspense through the peculiarity of what happens to Ozu at the end of the episode, especially notable in how it ties to what's revealed about Ozu at the end of the series.  Episode 2 uses  Watashi's film failures to foreshadow events in future episodes: the first movie to the episode 4 prank battle, the second to the wavering between three women arc, the third to the tatami room trap and the final to Watashi and Ozu's pseudo-romantic scene\u2014never narratively integral but always welcome as foreshadowing.\\n\\n\r\nOther foreshadowing aspects include the fortune-teller's statement that opportunity is dangling in front of Watashi, referring to the dangling Mochiguman that he's unable to take hold of until the very end. The opening and ending also hint at being trapped in the tatami rooms. There's always a sense of mystery and suspense regarding the nature of the alternate scenarios. Parallel reality is foreshadowed cleverly when the episodes 9 to 11 Watashi enters the episode 5 ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe series utilizes far more of these narrative ties, to a level few shows do:\\n\\n\r\n-How Ozu's circumstance in the ending of episode 1  ties to Ozu's stealing the blimp in episode 5, and to Ozu's true intentions revealed in episode 9. In the final episode, these narrative ties serve to grant context to what exactly happened in the ending of the first episode. \\n\r\n-How the final Watashi's gathering money in the tatami galaxy provided an explanation for how the Watashi in episode 4 obtained the money for the tortoise toothbrush.\\n\r\n-How episode 4 hinted at Hanuki learning English, how we learn aspects of her relationship with Higuchi throughout the episodes, and how episode 4 hints at Higuchi's desire to depart. \\n\r\n-How episode 2 introduces us to the love doll interest of Jogasaki for the three women arc.\\n\r\n-How Watashi's dream movie in episode 2 (about true love escaping position, age, and even gender) hints at Watashi and Ozu appearing in a pseudo-romantic scenario at the climax of the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nYet another touch worth noting is that  the reversing of orders for the opening and ending themes in the final episode parallels the role reversal between Watashi and Ozu at the very end of the series; Watashi becomes the dominant one while Ozu becomes hesitant. \\n\\n\r\nNow we shall move onto how the series conveys its themes. While episodes 1 and 2 serve as the introduction and episodes 10 and 11 serve as the conclusion, the middle of the series aims to explore different approaches of the rose-colored campus life. Episode 3 demonstrates the pitfall of Watashi working too hard to fly the birdman. He seeks happiness, but as the Icarus allusion suggests, he fails by soaring too high;  to work too hard to seek the rose-colored campus life is itself a folly. This is the most effective commentary of the middle episodes because it ties directly to the ending that suggests one must embrace the life one has rather than trying too hard to look for something greater. Episode 4 serves as a reflection moment of Watashi simply goofing around, and how even that can contribute to a satisfying life. Episode 5 demonstrates how the pursuit of convenience can lead to a burden, through the health food story. Episode 6-8 comment on the pitfall of focusing on too many pursuits at the same time. Episode 9 displays Watashi's attempts to fully embrace hedonism and disobey moral standards in an attempt to gain satisfaction. \\n\\n\r\nAll these approaches are proven to be ineffective, and the true solution the series posits is to embrace the life one currently has. None of the realities may be rose-colored, but each at least has a color, each has value that can be appreciated. \\n\\n\r\nThe final episode also accomplishes two more things of note. Firstly, it provides catharsis as Watashi runs over to Ozu. We see glimpses of all the Watashis from the various realities call out to Ozu, and coupled with the soundtrack makes for quite a satisfying scene. Secondly, it raises the idea that  individuals can appear more multi-faceted when approached from different angles. The quirks we see of the characters throughout the different parallel worlds scenarios provide us more context into who the characters truly are, rather than what they seem to be at a first glance. \\n\\n\r\nFrom an entertainment standpoint, TTG manages to keep the series engaging despite the repetitive nature of repeating the same scenarios. Although the motifs are recurring, they serve the purpose of interest and familiarity. TTG maintains freshness through different scenarios, commenting on various ideas while disclosing different information.Even the three episode women arc which directly repeated the same scenario three times knew how to spread out information for variety. For example, we didn't see the context for Jogasaki's and Watashi's drinking contest in the first episode of the arc, but it was revealed in the second. We also didn't get context into the pen pal woman until the final episode. Each of those three episodes revealed new information and different angles to that same scenario, thus preventing complete repetition.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these elements of praise for the Tatami Galaxy, there certainly is room for criticism. Firstly, although the middle episodes each had at least decent commentary, only the thematic commentary of episode 3 was particularly great. Episode 4's commentary on reflecting over doing nothing of value could have been interchanged with any other scenario; it worked, but wasn't a distinct story for that idea.  Episode 5's thematic commentary is of some merit, but the message of the folly of seeking trying too hard for conveinece isn't far from episode 3's message. \\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 6-8 presented the pitfalls of seeking too many pursuits at once, but the idea could have been better if it focused on Watashi following more concrete ambitions, such as being divided between different hobbies or interests (which was the backdrop). This is primarily favorable to prevent the need of three episodes for that matter; not to mention the comedic effect of the \"Jhonny\" bits doesn't last for that long. Episode 7 was questionable since Watashi's obsession with the love doll is far too exaggerated for his character, and said obsession contributes nothing thematically to the series. Episode 9's pursuit on hedonism was fine enough, but it's more of small detail and isn't as thought-provoking or relevant to the final message of the show as episode 3's Icarus allusion.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the characters have   nice touches and quirks here and there, the concept in the final episode of \"people being deep if viewed from different angles\" required more fleshing out of the characters. Throughout the episodes, Watashi is exaggerated and serves whatever role or characteristic he's needed for:  resolving to sabotage Jogasaki in episode 2,  an extreme ambition to improve in episode 3, and  a questionable obsession with the love doll in episode 7.His volatility can be in part excused by there being parallel versions, each mildly different from each other but parts of the true Watashi. Regardless, it hinders the portrayal of a coherent character who can be characterized throughout the story. Akashi is given sufficient quirks with her seclusion and her fear of moths, but her interest in Watashi throughout all the episodes is a little too contrived and questionable. Jogasaki is given the lovedoll quirk, which adds slightly to his character, but doesn't grant us much more from the arrogant individual he normally is. He's still his arrogant self; we  for example don't see the nuance of given vulnerabilities given particular stimuli. Higuchi works well for his role. Though portrayed as wise, he isn't wholly responsible.\\n\\n\r\nOzu is a fan favorite mainly because he seems to just get in the way but is revealed to have motivations of his own.  However, the way this portrayal was executed in the series was the issue. While Ozu is revealed to be involved in more than stifling Watashi, he is too fated and intertwined with Watashi in the middle episodes. A prime example is his stalking of Watashi with the letter inference in the three women arc. Going through such lengths would be uncharacteristic given his revealed personal interests.  More questionable is Ozu's personality change into docility at the end of the show, which differs from all the other realities. This sudden dissonance can however be symbolically  justified  as either a consequence of his cutting his thread of fate with Watashi in episode 9 or his true nature outside of Watashi's delusions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother minor gripe with the series is information that suggests the incorporation of time resets when the series uses parallel realities instead. While Watashi questioning whether he had relived certain scenarios throughout the middle episodes aims for suspense, it actually implies a time reset, thus conflicting with the parallel realities reveal.  The clock symbolism at the end of each episode, though it's a strong visual cue, also has the same problem. Both of these fulfill their purpose in terms of engagement, but the red-herring it results in is a problem, albeit a minor one.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we may inspect those aforementioned criteria to see how well the Tatami Galaxy fulfilled its premise. \\n\r\n1.It did feature commentary on various approaches to the rose-colored campus life, though many of those episodes could have been handled better. \\n\r\n2. It did provide a fulfilling concluding message that worked well with the usage of various colors to portray the colors of different lives. This could have been a more nuanced message, but was satisfying enough.\\n\r\n3. It did show us characters from different angles through different scenarios, but there was room for much more with them.\\n\r\n4. It did a phenomenal job at narrative ties and spreading out information throughout the episodes that could be connected throughout.\\n\r\n5.The series almost always remained fresh and varied with all its stylistic choices and apt ability to spread out information across episodes.\\n\r\n6. The series also did a phenomenal job with all those foreshadowing aspects and building up suspense.\\n\\n\r\nOne can see that the series did an exceptional job with (4) and (6), a great job with (5), a good job with (2), and an acceptable job with (1) and (3). As such, TTG had overall great execution of the premise it set out to explore. Consequently, dismissing it based on the contrivance of the premise is unfair. In addition to meeting these criteria, the series did an exceptional job at utilizing its symbolism throughout.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: \\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is indeed an example of a simple series executed really well. Although it had certain issues with the characters or  story mechanics and had room for improvement with the thematic commentary, it accomplished so much with its symbolism, foreshadowing, and narrative ties that it easily makes up for it. Through its technical mastery of the little details, TTG is a great, accessible, well-made work and is a hallmark of the medium.",

            "content": "When you look back on your life up until now, do you find yourself feeling somewhat dissatisfied with how things have turned out? Do you find yourself regretting choices you\u2019ve made, the people you\u2019ve met and end up wishing you could just give it another shot, knowing that this time around, everything would work out so much better for you?\r\n If you are just such a person, then watching Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei -or The Tatami Galaxy as it has come to be known in English- is one opportunity that you simply can't afford to pass up.\r\n The story of a nameless (referred to as 'Watashi')young man in his third year at Kyoto University, looking back on the numerous adventures, expeditions and escapades he has experienced during his time on campus. However, rather than fond memories, he finds himself feeling rather dissatisfied with the way things have turned out, and proceeds to ask himself where things started to go wrong.\\n\\n\r\n Perhaps it was the club he joined. Maybe he made a few bad decisions along the way. But in all likelihood, it was all Ozu's doing. But it doesn't really matter who is at fault. With his opportunity missed, Watashi has no choice but to harbour his bitterness and day dream about how things could have been so very different...\\n\\n\r\n And then something miraculous happens, and Watashi is given something that you and I will never have; a second chance. The perfect opportunity to go back to the beginning. The opportunity to do it all again, to avoid his previous mistakes and ensure himself a life of happiness. But one simple question still remains; which path should he take? Which of the various roads, streets and avenues is the one that leads to that most glorious of gardens, the rose-coloured campus life? \\n\\n\r\n Unsurprisingly for a character who's name essentially translates as 'I', Watashi is a character that is easy to identify with; after all, 'disappointment' does not discriminate based on sex, race or class, and at the end of the day we are all looking for the same thing Watashi is-- our own happiness.\\n\\n\r\n But he is just one of the many interesting characters in the Yojouhan universe- there's Watashi's quote-unquote friend Ozu, who seems to be set on preventing Watashi from enjoying a care-free existence. There's Master Higuchi, a local god engaged in a bitter \"war\" with the leader of the film circle. Last but not least there is Watashi's underclassman Akashi, who's charmingly cute appearance, sets the hearts of men flying, shortly before her distant and fiery attitude brings them crashing back down to earth like Icarus.\\n\\n\r\n But Yojouhan's most impressive achievement is its beautiful, understated visuals. Despite integrating features like stylised photography and simplified character designs, Yojouhan never feels like a Director's visual experiment, but a seamless, straightforward production; proving that looking good doesn't always mean you need to show off. Of course, the animation and directing is still top notch, as you would expect from a show that takes this much pride in its art.\\n\\n\r\n The soundtrack, while certainly not below average, is the only thing about Yojouhan that can adequately be referred to as a weakness. The background music -quiet pianos and melancholic violins- certainly do their job, but fail to be impressive. This is a little disappointing when compared with other aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\n The opening and ending themes do offer some condolences though, with a particularly catchy opener 'Maigoinu to Ame no Beat' by Asian Kung-Fu Generation features grungy guitars and lyrics about the banality of everyday life yet has a subtle optimism about it which feels perfect for Yojouhan. Meanwhile, the ending sequence combines an atmospheric trance song with some mesmerising visuals.\\n\\n\r\n Then there's the dialogue, set to the kind of pace one would normally expect in an auction-house. Long and complicated sentences that begin and end within the confines of a single breath. While it makes reading the subtitles a little bit of challenge at first, the extra effort is worth it, as it makes the dialogue far more interesting, and is just one of the many things that demonstrate the level of attention to detail in Yojouhan.\\n\\n\r\n Offering an interesting storyline and considerably more depth than the typical 'Slice-of-Life' anime and each episode offers something new and original, without ever having to rely on tired clich\u00e9s like hot spring or beach episodes. It gives the whole show a remarkable freshness, and every episode is a pleasure to watch. And best of all it, it manages to be so much more than just straight up entertainment- it actually has a point behind it all. It leaves you with something to think about, and without resorting to emotional blackmail.\\n\\n\r\n Whether you're an expert or a beginner, a casual or critic, watching Tatami Galaxy is the perfect choice for a few hours of quality entertainment. Anime this good only come around once every few years, so don't hesitate. Isn't it about time you seized the opportunity that is dangling in front of your eyes?\\n",

            "content": "\"This opportunity is always dangling in front of your eyes. You must grab this opportunity and act on it. And if you not, you will walk this life as now, ever unchanging.\" For starters, the opportunity would be this anime, and you shouldn't miss it, as it will impact your life, just as the quote suggests.\r\nThis starts off with a fast dialog quickly summing you up on the \"world\" the main characters lives in. You will quickly notice the special art that is very different from regular anime in any age. It doesn't resemble any art on any anime ever made, it might rather resemblea little bit of a regular cartoon. It could suit your taste, or you can just live on with it, however, this kind of artstyle is very open to symbolic images. Rather then watching how the plot progresses, the animation is based around the thoughts of the character. In the same time while you're reading the subs, you could take a glimpse of the image going on, and it will force you to think at the same time while reading. So this is not for just pass time, it fills a role of a psychological activity that might change the way you think about certain situations in life.\\n\\n\r\nThe most amazing thing about this anime are the characters. They're well thought out and written. Watashi, the protagonist, is just a regular guy pursuing the regular \"rose-colored campus life\". He thinks that it is perfectly normal, that it is finally time to leave his past behind, and start anew.  On his \"adventures\" he meets Ozu. He is a \"demon\" looking guy, his look resembles his personality as in he feeds on others unhappiness and sadness. Another notable character would be Akashi. She is not so sociable, doesn't like to interact with others, but she's very open to people that are close to her. There are many other characters, but telling you about them here would just spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother unique part of this show would be it's diversity. As it offers many different perspectives throughout the episodes, featuring \"new\" characters, or rather remade characters. This show with its diversity makes you question is what you're doing the right choice? I mean it's the right choice to watch this, but I'm reffering to normal life. This teaches you in some way that what's done is done. You can wish, or think of what would've happened if you did or didn't do something, but that alternative way won't happen. However, you can experience how it would really end up if it did, in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis also shows you that while you're going for your life goal, you're living your life, not when you reach it. When you do, many more ways to other goals open. \\n\\n\r\nSome episodes serve as a purpose for later development but just going through them isn't as fun as watching the climax of the show. Most of them are actually very fun, but there are 1 or 2 that are good, but not so fulfilling. Those episodes before the climax are what tells me to not give this show a 10 because these little flaws are what keep the perfect shows from near perfect, so i settled for a 9.\\n\\n\r\nEven though this appears mysterious , the message of this anime is clear as a river, so you won't have the \"wtf factor\" up.  I repeat, you shouldn't miss this opportunity.",

            "content": "If there was ever a time to slow clap it out, this would be the precise time to.\r\nThis series really is why I love episodic series. The bad ones obviously suck beyond belief, but when shows like this one make optimal use of them they can really turn into something unique, and the short stories can allow for ideas that would normally not fit within a linear storyline. A lot of things have to be done right in order to get a good episodic series, though, but to me the key seems to be creativity, along with somehow finding a way to build-up: connecting thedifferent episodes together. I believe that if these aren\u2019t present, you\u2019re just better off with a linear storyline in order to get the best out of your characters. But Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei has both of them.\\n\\n\r\nA man is miserable. Despite all his dreams of a \u201cRose-Coloured Campus Life\u201d filled with raven-haired maidens who dote on him, his social life is going nowhere. He has no girlfriend, his only good friend keeps getting him into trouble, and the circle he joined brings him no joy. So he tries again, and again, reliving his first two years of college life ad nauseum, making different decisions each time, having no recollection that he\u2019s already done this all before. Will the man ever be satisfied with how his life turns out?\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs have a stylish comic book economy that give the impression the animators completed each frame in just a few strokes. The exception is Ozu, Watashi's friend who has a frightfully amphibious face: a head like a fish's, teeth like a shark's, and unnervingly dark lips set against a pale visage. Occasionally, in his wiliest moments, they give him a wagging fox tail. Other than that, most of the artistry occurs in the background details (fractal patterns in the trees and the scenery made of eerie black-and-white live-action photography), the framing of the shots, and the precision editing, which cement Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei's patchwork aesthetic beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nThey tend to merge real life shots and video in with the episodes when appropriate and it doesn't seem too out of place which is kinda hard to do so that's a plus. There were no crazy battles, no artsy flips or anything out of the ordinary. However what they did need to do was done well.\\n\\n\r\nThe artistic style is loose and stylized, which helps purposefully misrepresent the characters and allows for the art to change at the drop of a hat. Allusions and symbolism between episodes are amusing or subtle, keeping the story creative in its connections. Most of all, the sense of humor of the series continually seeks to entertain even when the general atmosphere is introspective, maintaining the show\u2019s levity throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is borderline strong - the OP is a modern classic by AKFG - I rarely sit through the OP on anime, but I did throughout this series.\\n\r\nThe ED was pretty fitting especially for the mood at the end of each episode and oddly seemed to also fit the animation sequence.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the OST is just a decent compliment to the whole story but never takes on a life past background music, arguably what it's intended for and in which case would be perfect but sometimes you can't beat a crazy score overlaying a scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting is very well-done, too.  It takes talent to be able to speak so quickly and so level-headedly as Watashi, and Shintaro Asanuma does not disappoint.  Even the more cartoonish, exaggerated characters like Ozu and Higuchi receive proper treatment.\\n\\n\r\nYuasa Masaaki\u2019s work on Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei thrives on its ability to avoid stagnation and build a developing story even when each episode follows the exact same structure. In fact, it is this very paradox that drives the creativity. Wonderfully planned out, believable, and deep.\\n\\n\r\nYuasa\u2019s dynamic storytelling is further bolstered by the characters, who act as the foundation of the ever-changing state of the singular story. The main character Watashi, or simply I, acts as the unreliable narrator, which drives the perspective of the show. The defeatist attitude with which he views the world skews the very nature of things. His character seems pitiful, his actions absurd. Yet it is these very actions that form his identity as he moves from episode to episode. He is not a static character that commits the same mistake again and again; rather, the choices he makes are multiform and logically or emotionally sound, even if his character flaws cause him to fail again and again.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are equally delightful in their depictions, which begin archetypical and seemingly one-dimensional. Some are malicious, others are lecherous, and a few are downright whimsical. But Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is quick to remind us of Watashi\u2019s unreliability by providing alternate looks at these characters, creating interpretations that are hardly apparent at the beginning but still complimentary to the quirks seen in the first few episodes. The development of these characters come naturally, and their presence in the story support Watashi\u2019s characterization immensely.\\n\\n\r\nAt first sight, the way in which this series keeps resetting itself after every episode may seem weird at first, but it actually was a brilliant method to flesh out its different characters. Because of its very frequent resets, this stands out even more than series that did similar things in the past, like Higurashi and Umineko. Because of this, we get to see a ton of different sides of the characters that would never have been able to been shown without these resets, and the most important part is that we see Watashi develop in many different ways throughout each episode. The different side-characters all have their own parts to play in Watashi (the lead character)\u2019s world and everything comes together wonderfully in the final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is one of the most underrated, under appreciated and unknown anime. It is a hidden gem unknown to people. You will rarely see an anime that is very funny but has a very deep meaning. If you are looking for a unique, non-mainstream, non-complex and very interesting story.\\n\\n\r\nThis really is an amazing work. It'll make you rethink life which is rare these days. Sure an anime might awe you with an amazing character to the point you try to emulate their traits. But very few make you reconsider life from a new point of view. I highly suggest you watch it, because it really has it all.\\n\\n\r\nSo let us all gather around a 4.5 Tatami Room slurping on our delicious Neko Ramen.",

            "content": "The choices you make might change, but the end result will always be the same.\r\nFor our unnamed main character\u2014we\u2019ll call him Watashi\u2014this couldn\u2019t be more true. He\u2019s a college dropout at the end of his rope, eating a meal at the end of the night at a ramen stand. There, he meets a (self proclaimed) God of Matrimony. After this God\u2019s inexplicably large chin tells Watashi that he basically knows everything about him, our hapless main character is sent on a flashback to his not so great college years.\r\nThe flashback of his college years zips on by, and so does Watashi\u2019s narration of events. Hetalks at a thousand miles per hour, and that might keep people away from watching this show since the dialog is hard to follow. Don\u2019t. Watashi is hard to follow, but the show he\u2019s in isn\u2019t. Think of him as a guy being forced to talk about what happened in his past but does so as fast and painless as he can. He\u2019s selfish, and doesn\u2019t care about easing the viewer into his life nor does he care for seeing people as they are.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, while Watashi\u2019s lightspeed narration takes over the soundtrack, the way he sees the world takes over the visuals. Every backdrop looks like a cardboard cutout and the characters lack color, but the design choice is deliberate. The design shows the way Watashi sees the world, so focused on himself that what he sees around him might as well be a parody. The easygoing members of the Softball Club, for example, all have the same smiling face, while the repo men of the Bicycle Police (don\u2019t ask) look more like gorilla\u2019s in prison suits. Yes, really.\\n\\n\r\nThis narrow focus from Watashi also affects what the viewer learns about the people in his life, meaning not much is learned about them at all. Instead, the characters are closer to ideas in his life. Jougasaki, for example, is Watashi\u2019s antithesis for success, being handsome, buff, and leads the Misogi Movie Club, while Watashi is average looking, scrawny, and barely keeps his place in any club. Jougasaki and his biceps often play the villain role to Watashi, and his other hobbies include boobs, a far cry from Watashi\u2019s sexual repression.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Ozu, the wildcard in Watashi\u2019s life, the kind of guy who can be one\u2019s best friend or worst enemy depending on how one approaches life. Ozu\u2019s described as not having a single good trait about him, but as the show goes on he shows a wit sharper than his teeth and foresight wider than his narrow eyes. Watashi\u2014and the viewer\u2014is never sure how Ozu does what he does, whether it\u2019s getting classified information or hijacking a blimp. But Ozu\u2019s also the fall guy, who Watashi blames for the way his life has turned out.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, as Watashi is sent on a flashback through his not so great college years, he thinks that his life might\u2019ve turned out better if he joined a different club, so he joins the Tennis Club. He doesn\u2019t just want a good life, but a rose colored campus life. Through club activities, he plans to surround himself with raven haired maidens and reach sweet, sweet romance. But he can\u2019t make any friends, let alone start a romance, and is instead stuck with Ozu. Whether from Ozu\u2019s mischief, Jougasaki\u2019s villainy, or his own selfishness, Watashi ends up not liking where his life ends up, and relives his flashback to join a different club in hopes of getting a rose colored campus life.\\n\\n\r\nAnd does it again.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter what club Watashi joins, the end result is always the same, and he never seems to learn. Do more than a few things always go wrong after Watashi joins a club? Maybe. Is Watashi setting his expectations too high? Definitely. But how else would he act? He\u2019s fresh out of high school and been sheltered all his life. A guy like that is bound to be a hopelessly na\u00efve fool, as he often points out every time his hopes are dashed. But what\u2019s really baffling\u2014or believable, in his case\u2014is how often he looks past what\u2014or who\u2014he does have, like Akashi.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because Akashi is that friend, who\u2019s also a girl, who might become Watashi\u2019s girlfriend if he just thought to talk to her more. She treats him more fondly than she treats others, but she doesn\u2019t throw herself at him. She has other concerns, like her engineering, and always tells it like she sees it, able to keep even Jougasaki at bay. She isn\u2019t the companion Watashi deserves, but the companion Watashi needs. That said, the romance is non-existent, but this show isn\u2019t a romance; it\u2019s a story about a guy who wouldn\u2019t know opportunity if it dangled in front of his face.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while Watashi ignores opportunity, he keeps reliving his college years in hopes of getting a rose colored campus life. Through this, the show becomes frustrating, but not for the right reasons.\\n\\n\r\nFor theme, it makes sense for the show\u2019s story to be repetitive. Because no matter what choice Watashi makes, the end result is always the same. The problem is the show\u2019s repetitive execution. The first five episodes have different set-ups, but the opening, middle, and final act of each episode is roughly the same. It tries to be different with each episode, but those common threads end up bringing focus to how similar they are.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the last six episodes take the same set-up, but they play out differently and are only similar in their final acts. They don\u2019t try too hard to be unified, and this lets each episode be its own story while still keeping to the show\u2019s theme, which makes for a refreshing watch. But this begs the question of why the show doesn\u2019t do something similar for its first half. The show is supposed to be challenging, I get it, but until the halfway point it\u2019s not even obtuse; just awfully repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nThat repetition also brings down the characters. As characters themselves, they\u2019re all great. But their interactions with each other become repetitive. Seeing Watashi dread his first meeting with Ozu loses impact after the second time, and the scene of Watashi saving Akashi from a random moth can only be cute so many times before it becomes old hat. Until the show\u2019s second half, their interactions with each other become predictable, and the sad thing is it doesn\u2019t need to be.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the nature of the show\u2019s theme ends up making it too easy for it to become repetitive. But since it was able to keep the story refreshing from the halfway point onward, I have to wonder what this show could have become if its effort were better directed in the first half. It definitely has thematic focus, it knows what it wants to say, and has a great cast of characters needed to say it. It could be an excellent show, but it\u2019s not there yet.\\n\\n\r\nI say \u201cyet\u201d because writing and directing is something that can improve with time. I\u2019d like to see this show remade with that improvement in mind, its effort redirected to avoid being repetitive, to be better than it is now. It DID show the ability to be better than it is now, which makes it so frustrating it fell short of being excellent. As it is now, Tatami Galaxy isn\u2019t a rose colored experience, but it\u2019s definitely an opportunity worth grabbing.",

            "content": "Anyone may have wondered whether their past or current student life matched with their expectations, and in some cases, if not on most, they may find themselves pondering whether decisions made were correct, or if some improvement could have been made. Expectations of a rose-coloured campus life and regrets are no exception either; such is the case of Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, also known as Tatami Galaxy, in which a nameless protagonist exactly has these issues. It is a fantastic journey into the realm of university life, mingled with time travelling.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe premise of Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei may be of simple nature at first glance, having thenameless protagonist, often referred to as \"Watashi\", live a rather lackluster life in comparison with his own expectations. This is due to mainly Ozu, both his friend and enemy, as he seems to make his life as miserable as possible, besides Watashi himself being a lazy, gutless person. The protagonist finds himself one day eating together with a aubergine faced man, which makes him reflect on his past years of college that in turn hurls him through time to experience his life anew.\\n\\n\r\nTime travelling - time loops in this case - is certainly of one the most interesting aspects of the anime. Watashi repeatedly lives his student life each time, though there is a gist to it: he remembers nothing each time this happens, only having vague memories of events and people around him. This may seem simple, but there is little margin for error upon executing such a narrative, as it can end in failure when handled improperly. Each episode is well done with a natural progression of events; however, as story progresses, the time travels may feel repetitive. Comedic relief is also available, presented through events and encounters with people who serve to enhance the overall atmosphere of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is treated as an independent one, yet viewers observe how in each chapter human relationships are shown and developed, as well as displaying hints that adds to the overall progression of the storyline, which in the final episode all events of the puzzle fall together with a satisfying conclusion. These afore-mentioned relationships are such, that anyone can easily relate to the main protagonist and all the events that take place, being stuck with a drunkard or any other club activity. Other aspect of the anime is the heavy monologuing that take place, which occasionally can be surprisingly fast, making it difficult to follow the story when not fully committing to the anime.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is small, yet of great diversity, people types you can often find in university. However, the main focus of the story doesn't lie on secondary characters, being Watashi its main focus. This is not to say that these aren't well crafted; each is an interesting character on its own that contribute a great deal to the overall progression of events, which are crucial for understanding actions and relationships of the different characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for character development, only Watashi is of importance. Throughout the anime viewers observe how he evolves from being indesicive and lazy, to a person he always aspired to be, straightforward and honest. Other interesting character is Ozu, who seems to be the source of ailments for Watashi. He is somewhat the \"enemy\" of the main protagonist, yet all his actions have purpose. I believe him to represent the way we interpret people, which doesn't necessarily reflect their genuine personality, as Watashi undergoes changes, his point of view on Ozu does as well.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Tatami Galaxy is of high quality, character movements being fluid. The art style is another matter, as it can be a hit/miss for viewers. At first it gave the impression of being a Shaft produced anime with the visuals and heavy monologuing, yet to my surprise, it was actually produced by Madhouse. It is very unconventional, yet fits well when trying to display characters behaviour and the environment through bending character movements and environments; backgrounds are not spared either. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors performed their roles well, being Watashi's and Ozu's one certainly the most appealing to hear, followed by Akashi's voice actor. The soundtrack used fulfilled its purpose, yet is nothing outstanding. I must mention that the opening song had quite the catchy tune.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nYojouhan Shinwa Taikei was overall an enjoyable experience with a well crafted storyline and good use of the time travelling concept. Characters were well presented and were of importance to the story. I am personally no real fan of this art style, and found it rather off-putting at first. I myself found the different events an interesting watch, yet couldn't really identify myself with it, consequently not fully enjoying it. Nevertheless, I can easily see why this is so popular, so I can recommended it to anyone who has an interest in college life. After all, this a wonderful story of acceptance of yourself and embracement of the countless oportunities life has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "We all carry regrets throughout our lives and experiences we feel have been a detriment to us. They can range from the seemingly smallest things to those events which we feel turn our world upside down for the worst. But what if we spend more time thinking about how those experiences shape us and help us benefit in the future? \r\nThe Tatami Galaxy sets out to explore this and it manages to do so through marvellous storytelling, vivid art, expressive dialogue and meaningful characters. It is, in short, a truly memorable experience.\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is a story about life and how we choose to liveit. We often set expectations for how we want things to unfold but we either don't have the courage to make these things take place. To help carry such an important message it's vital that your main character be a well written one. Thankfully that's the case here. Our protagonist Watashi is your average student dealing with these problems of trying to construct a positive future. When he sets out to achieve his dream 'rosy' campus life he soon finds there are many hurdles to overcome. Our protagonist is easy enough to relate to in some form. Whether it may be his ambitious, caring, evil, envious or loving side it's always very believable and quite real. His experiences from episode to episode make you care for what conclusion may come his way. His character evolution is brilliantly handled.\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to dive into the story much further than what has already been stated in the synopsis and not ruin the experience. The main plot device used between the episodes is certainly nothing new but thankfully the mixture of colourful characters and superb dialogue, in particular from leading pair Watashi and Ozu, help carry the show through that. The talking comes quick, not a second is wasted when watching. It can range from philosophical without being overbearing through to being humorous without overdoing it. It's arguably the biggest strength of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest themes the show rolls with is seeing things from new perspectives, and just when the show has you seeing characters in a particular light it starts to shape them into something different. The supporting cast are all interesting both in their backgrounds and their design. For a show very much centred around one person it's great to see the cast around him were still very nicely fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art may turn some people off but to me it screams creativity. It's a blend of the abstract, exaggerated and expressive. The show jumps between prominent colours frequently but also does so with meaning, using it as a means to set a tone or express the development of our main character. The backgrounds are also gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy explores a sizeable portion of themes - love, sex, ambition, depression, greed - but they are all balanced out well. This balance is on display no better than in the final two, perfectly packaged final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it's very difficult to tell people much about the show without spoiling anything. Just experience it. Take a plunge. You're bound to take something positive away from it.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nTatami Galaxy is a VERY unusual anime. This is an oddly drawn existentialist comedy that attempts to tackle the meaning of life over 11 episodes, that are all basically the same episode except the last one. Tatami doesn't look like an anime. At no point does it ever feel like an anime. It is Japanese and is animated, so it is technically an anime. However, this is less Bleach and Naruto and more an Avant Garde, European art film.\r\nPlot: 9/10\r\nThe plot is that a hapless college student is aiming to have \"the greatest college life ever\" and has impossibly large dreams after a rather lonelyand sad high school experience. He doesn't instantly become a Casanova and is filled with bitterness and anger. He then meets a Mephistopheles like tempter named Ozu. Ozu persuades our hero to be an anti-cupid and split apart lovers while causing as much misery as possible. If he can't be happy then nobody should be happy. The hero is seemingly killed by an angry mob at the end of episode 1, but the God of Love rewinds time and gives our hero a second chance. You are going to be seeing these rewinds A LOT. I guess the art film \"Run Lola Run\" did it, so why not our artsy anime? Each episode the hero makes the same mistakes and doesn't realize the happiness that was under his nose the entire time. He doesn't stop and smell the roses and instead goes off on a Quixotic quest of some kind. Our hero eventually must learn that happiness lies in appreciating the small things in life that give us joy. Happiness lies in things like daring to ask out that girl that you love. \"Try to live while you live, for tomorrow you die!\" -War and Peace by Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy\\n\\n\\n\r\ncharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist is never given a name. This is perhaps so that we the viewer will have an easier time projecting on to him, but may be just yet another example of Tatami trying REALLY hard to be deep and artsy. Hey, \"Notes From the Underground\" did it, so my anime should clearly try to emulate it in order to be sophisticated! Our protagonist is an everyman kind of character that most anime fans can identify with. He wasn't \"mr popular\" in high school and thinks surely his college years will be different. He aims far too high and even compares himself to Icarus from Greek mythology in episode 3. The other main character is Ozu, who is a devil that begrudgingly works for God and ends up helping the protagonist. Think of Mephistopheles from Goethe's Faust or perhaps Woland from The Master and Margarita. Only Ozu isn't 1/10th as awesome as Woland. I'm not giving Tatami THAT much credit!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is...odd. That isn't to say it is bad. It combines the fluidity and energy of FLCL with the super pale skin and bizarre character art from the Iranian cartoon Persepolis. That is really the closest I can get to describing what the art is like.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it does make use of some classical music, the soundtrack isn't really that memorable. Probably because this is a very speech heavy anime and music would get in the way rather than help.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Tatami galaxy is weakest. Here is one thing that really fucking annoyed me, although it isn't technically a flaw. The speech is ridiculously fast to try capture the \"steam of consciousness\" feel. Although this has worked well for many esteemed authors including Joyce, Woolf, and Faulkner, it isn't used as often in film. When you are reading a book, you can read at your own pace, even when a character is experiencing a raging river of random thoughts. In a film, if characters talk too fast, the audience loses a lot of the dialogue. This is ESPECIALLY a problem if the audience speaks a different language and has to watch a subtitled version because no dub exists. Unless you are a speed reading champion, you have to literally hit pause every 5 seconds to avoid missing huge chunks of important dialogue. The director intended this anime for a Japanese audience, so he wasn't actually thinking about this issue. That is the main reason that I couldn't consider it a major flaw. The second major problem is that nearly every episode is the same fucking episode! Tatami was adapted from a short novel and should have honestly been a movie rather than an 11 episode anime. There is no reason this needed more than 4-5 episodes to tell this story and deliver the themes and message it wanted to give. It is highly unusual that an 11 episode anime feels stretched, but that actually applies to Tatami.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTatami Galaxy tries REALLY hard to be different, deep, and artsy, but it actually does a pretty damn good job! This is certainly not a series for everyone, so if you prefer action and science fiction to existentialist art films then please stay far, far, away from Tatami Galaxy! You will hate every last second of it. However, for those of us that like a philosophical art film once in a while, Tatami Galaxy is a solid entry to add to your view list. I really liked this series and enjoyed how it laughed in the face of commercialism. This series took risks and had balls like a tanuki! Does it really have the same depth as the novels and films it clearly wants to be like?...probably not. I'm guessing this won't be praised in 150 years to the same degree as War and Peace, Notes From the Underground, and the true heavy hitters of existentialist fiction.  Having said that, this series WAS quite good and certainly had a lot more philosophical depth and artistic daring than the average anime. I award Tatami a well deserved 9/10!",

            "content": "Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is one of those rare anime that doesn't conform to the norm in terms of storytelling and art direction, something that's quite refreshing. This coming of age anime is packed with beautiful art and animations, great use of symbolism, and poetic dialogue.\r\nIts unique story structure helps make every episode act like a stand-alone episode, while also being a puzzle that leads up to a very satisfying conclusion by the final episode. It's an interesting way to tell a story, although it can get very repetitive and predictable. \r\nOn the other hand, I find the plot to be quite dull, and the presentation/directionis best described as pretentious. The narration comes across as bombastic, with excessively wordy and verbose dialogue that doesn't always mean anything. There's a lot of emphasis on style, but not enough substance. Oh and speaking of dialogue... boy is it fast compared to most other anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe speedy dialogue is very much like a double-edged sword. Having to pause every so often in order to process the fast-paced dialogue can become a frustrating experience from the get-go. When most of one's concentration is focused on keeping up with the narration's speed, it becomes difficult to simultaneously notice and enjoy background elements/scenes. The main character Watari often switches from one topic to another completely random topic within seconds, making it difficult to figure out the point of what he's trying to say at times. On the bright side, there's extra ideas and content squeezed into each episode, which is always a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is truly unique in many ways, but that doesn't always equate to it being \u201cgenius.\" To be specific, I'd say it's more along the lines of creative, poetic, avant-garde, and experimental. Even though this anime is personally not my cup of tea, it's still a one-of-a-kind anime that\u2019s worth trying out at least once in your life. \\n",

The message is simple, the idea isn\u2019t. Tatami Galaxy weaves a complicated string of narrative threads through a canvas that tells a humble story. How would you relive a moment in your life which you believe has gone down the wrong path? What if it wasn\u2019t one moment, but a combination of moments. A cacophony of looping situations with slight differences that all lead to a split second in which you realize that you haven\u2019t achieved your goal. That miserable moment where you realize the last two years was wasted. What doyou blame it on? Do you blame it on a person? An event? A choice? \\n\\n\r\nOur nameless protagonist, Watashi, which translates to \u201cI\u201d in Japanese meets a man at a midnight ramen stand. This man explains that he is the \u201cgod of matrimony\u201d and he\u2019s trying to match up two people. This brings Watashi to reflect upon his last two years which he believes have been wasted. And so, a clever twist on a groundhog loop begins. We relive the past two years of Watashi\u2019s life every episode, and we see the different choices he could\u2019ve taken to achieve what he calls a \u201crose-colored campus life\u201d. Multiple common threads and situations tie every episode together. Similar pieces of dialogue in different contexts illuminate a whole picture for the viewer as we begin to figure out the story as our protagonist does. Every choice he makes is one that is in line with his character arc and the end the final choice that leads him to true success. \\n\\n\r\nThis exquisitely crafted story expertly portrays a common idea. However, if you boil down any story ever told, it can be whittled down to certain, previously used elements observed in various other, older works. There are only so many stories you can tell. So the way you want to tell them is in a way which expresses your own unique ideologies. If the story is about a finding yourself, what kind of approach do you take? Expressing yourself through your drawings, your directing, your characters. A great director can express himself through the narrative and visuals. I feel like I understand Yuasa just a little bit more after Tatami Galaxy wrapped up. \\n\\n\r\nThe amount of effort Tatami Galaxy put into conveying its theme is what ended up selling the story so much more. The grounded, yet surrealistic approach to the narrative as well as the visuals lined up perfectly with what you could view this dreamlike experience. Yet unlike so many anime which I\u2019ve seen, this fantastical and surreal story is rooted in some of the most human emotion I\u2019ve ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nI want to treat this review more as just a dump of my feelings, rather than some in-depth analysis or overly-structured points. This is because I don\u2019t think a show like this favors that. The story it tells is to be experienced and analyzing it, while mandatory, is something that you yourself, as a viewer, should do. It is that kind of narrative. One which you can siphon your own thoughts from based on your own experiences. However, it\u2019s three-prong narrative, which explains the foreground, background, and meta nature that is accessible to every viewer. The story succeeds on three levels, which is three times more than most. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Style is Substance]\\n\\n\r\nA common complaint I hear is that something can be too focused on a style and neglect to add this pesky thing called \u201csubstance\u201d. Much like the various other buzzwords I\u2019ve deconstructed over the course of my reviews, substance is yet another word which bothers me beyond belief. Not because it is wholly and unarguably subjective what substance in entertainment can be, but because it is often used as a criticism by people who can\u2019t explain their point. If they disliked something it \u201clacked substance\u201d, and if they loved it \u201chad bountiful substance\u201d. Yet what they never explain is what that substance means to them.\\n\\n\r\nSubstance, as I\u2019ve gathered in a colloquial sense, means story, character, narrative, structure, and visuals. It means it all. More importantly, though, it means a balance of it all. If the focus is uniformly on creating an effects reel of beautifully composed shots that lack intriguing characters, then that project \u201clacks substance\u201d. Personally, I believe substance is everything that is decided by the viewer. It is what you value. If that\u2019s poorly constructed romance with overly corny dialogue and cloying emotional resonance? Then so be it. That is your substance. That is the metaphoric matter that makes up the piece of entertainment which you enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea that substance in any way is separate from style is preposterous. It is what makes up the project and if the director intends it to be wholly stylistic then so be it. However, when you can blend incredible style and an impressive narrative then you are creating a project that is successful on two fronts. It isn\u2019t stylistic and full of substance; it is simply a stylistic story. Something that makes your jaw drop both visually and narratively. \\n\\n\r\nTatami utilizes a unique kind of pervasive animation where it not only blends photo-imagery with animated characters but also filters real-life video so it fits the animation. It\u2019s an incredible blend of self-indulgent stylization and surrealistic substance. It fits the kind of illusory narrative being unraveled. There are also various smaller animated ideas utilized throughout. A few rotoscoped scenes looked particularly captivating. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest boon that this astonishing visual flair adds is that it gives Yuasa the opportunity to craft scenes that speak through their visuals. Metaphoric representations of common concepts are rife in this series, specifically within the sexuality of this series. The symbolism that is shown isn\u2019t subtle, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. The visual style supplements the lack of subtle symbolism because the style itself is wholly abrasive. It only makes sense for the rest of the show to be that way. That isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t subtle themes and motifs, there are. Particularly in how various objects or creatures are incorporated to portray a certain character\u2019s entire being. Whether they be love dolls, moths, or the devil himself. \\n\\n\r\nTatami Galaxy is masterfully constructed by Masaaki Yuasa, who has always been a director and creator I admired due to his unique eye for visual storytelling. How certain stylistic choices can set an atmosphere that tells a more compelling narrative than the exposited narrative. My first encounter with Yuasa was in an episode of Adventure Time which he storyboarded and directed. For those who don\u2019t know, Adventure Time is a wonderful cartoon that airs in the west. Later on in its run it began to incorporated various guest animators in the same vein that Space Dandy did. This guest animator would come in and completely take over an episode, crafting a story with previously established characters in a completely new visual assembly. Yuasa fashioned this eleven-minute episode of Adventure Time so memorably that it is one of my favorite episodes of the entire series to this day. His art style, but specifically the way he draws was so captivating that I honestly blame him as one of the many reasons I\u2019m so into the animated medium. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Characters Living in a Room with a Meta-Narrative]\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy maintains a static list of characters throughout its run time. Each one has established traits that get elaborated on as the series progresses. Your preconceived notions of these characters are challenged as every episode rounds to a close because each episode portrays them similarly, but with new background information that helps color your perception of the story. This is the kind of fractured narrative which I adore. There are only a few shows out there that utilize the idea of a fractured narrative well, and I can say that The Tatami Galaxy uses it perfectly. \\n\r\nOur protagonist meets this trouble-making devil-boy, Ozu, who seems to be attached to him through every timeline we see in the series. It is if the cosmic string of fate drags these characters together. Ozu plays the contrast to Watashi. He helps paint the conclusion to the narrative before the conclusion even begins. The story tells itself so well that you begin to understand with the characters, which is a marvel. The ability to express an idea with enough complexity to stay mysterious, but with enough honesty and established elements to maintain realism is not something to ignore. This is only an element of some of the best mysteries ever created. \\n\\n\r\nSo many lesser-mysteries often include elements that were never previously established to wrap a story up. While this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad way to write, it is a way that ultimately doesn\u2019t feel cathartic. These characters are attempting to unravel a mystery but unfortunately, a certain element is kept just off-sight that you can\u2019t unravel it with them. All you can do is throw a few pot-shots at the conclusion and maybe you might get it right by sheer chance. What Tatami does is lay out a foundation and continually build on it. This foundation is shown through Watashi\u2019s choice of clubs, each choice signifying a different route he wanted to take in that life.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, what draws this interesting twist on the groundhog loop is that no character is fully aware that they are experiencing the same events because these events are all occurring at the same time. Much like parallel timelines, these aren\u2019t events that happen one after the other. Watashi\u2019s timelines all create a different character by the end, however, this different character is still dealing with similar issues that lead him to regret his life choices due to similar beliefs. This occurs to almost every character. While this story is Watashi\u2019s, every other character has similar notions of the past and present, as in, there are lingering relations that they seem to have even though they just met each other. This conscious decision is made to keep these characters attached through a thread of fate, which is later explained as a feeling of \u201cnostalgia\u201d towards one another. It\u2019s a very metaphysical way of approaching life. The idea that your relationship to someone grew through perhaps a meeting in another timeline where you met each other through different means.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s where the interesting structure comes to play further. While these events may be happening at the same time for the characters, they aren\u2019t happening at the same time for the viewer. The story has a foreground narrative, a background narrative, and a meta-narrative, which all come together by the end to create one of the most satisfying and cathartic finales I\u2019ve ever seen in television. \\n\\n\r\nThe reversal that\u2019s experienced by our protagonist is one that can only be described as \u201cthematically relate-able\u201d. A term I reserve for moments where the character progression is both in line with the story, and in line with the way I\u2019d logically understand our character\u2019s motivations. Watashi\u2019s final goal being that of a \u201crose-colored campus life\u201d is, in itself, a rose-tinted thought. A thought plagued by preconceived notions of what a college experience \u201cshould\u201d be like, rather than what you make of it. This can be drawn, in a meta way, to the idea of what a story should be. What substance should be. What you should expect from your experience with a television show. This narrative is wholly meta since the entire thing is being exposited to us by Watashi, the nameless protagonist. He speaks to us, and his ability to is never fully explained. This one-sided conversation is only supplemented by his conversation with his other conscious, his lust. This relate-able, realistic take on a choice, any choice, continues to impress with the narratives ability to keep similar moments feel interesting by injecting new facts and connecting these universes together. When the truth is revealed and the story begins to make sense, everything slowly starts falling into place. As the description of a 4.5 Tatami mat is exposited, you understand that the story is about breaking an undesirable loop and begin to understand that the life you are living is one that you ultimately cannot change. Watashi\u2019s happiness is his own. When he wanders meaninglessly through thousands of same, yet semi-different Tatami rooms he begins to crave the life he\u2019s lived throughout the rest of the show. That same life which he felt that he ultimately ruined.  \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Realism]\\n\\n\r\nThe experience is realistic. In the same sense that any story can be realistic, regardless of the setting. You can tell a high-fantasy story that has more realistic characters than a cop drama set in urban Detroit. That\u2019s simply because a character is only likable if you can logically understand them. That understanding can either be logical or through relating to them. An often-misunderstood aspect of character writing is that you must make your characters relatable to everyone. Obviously, that\u2019s impossible, so instead, you need to make them rational. If put into the kind of situation they are in, regardless of what it is they need to act logically to be related to. Because regardless of who they are, you can still place yourself in their shoes. \\n\r\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen, anime has problems with this. Perhaps it is simply cultural and I\u2019m just some westerner who doesn\u2019t understand. However, so many anime avoids writing nuanced characters in favor of attempting to make them fully self-insert-able. Not relatable, but completely fantastical. The line between relate-able and non-relate-able is much closer than you may think. One misstep and they turn into someone that is just there to appeal to everyone, which comes off as fake, or someone there to be used as wish-fulfillment, which is also fake and obnoxious. The unfortunate thing is, this goes for so many anime. Not even just the trashy harems or the bombastic shounen, but so many anime fall in line with creating characters that aren\u2019t real, as much as their traits are over-exaggerated to fit in line with what may sell. \\n\\n\r\nThis may be due to multiple reasons, either my cynicism or the kind of demographic the majority of anime is aimed at; Teenagers. Miyazaki said that it is because the otaku has become the producer, and creates products based on his own interest in the medium. He believes that since the otaku is incapable of observing humans, they reference manga or anime that relates to them and draw conclusions on how people act from that, which obviously isn\u2019t representative of real people. This detracts from human storytelling because the way you capture a real person is not just through characterization, but through the way they speak, the imperfections that lay with how they look or how they behave.\\n\\n\r\n These imperfections are paramount to create realistic characters. These imperfections are virtually non-existent in a medium where every girl needs to be colorful, sexy, and purely marketable. This completely unnatural and idolized view on someone causes these characters to be inherently unlikeable to me. They are just toys to be looked at and rated on all these stupid \u201cbest girl\u201d lists and conversations; They are objects of affection, goalposts, non-existent and completely illogical hunks of figurative meat. This whole industry is full of that shit and it\u2019s saddening because animation is such an expressive medium being held down by whatever is creating this putrid need to create non-challenging boring childish entertainment. Where everything sexual is played as a clich\u00e9 and treated like a thirteen-year-old would treat a course on the human body. Maybe it\u2019s just how cynical I\u2019ve become so quickly.\\n\\n\r\n Tatami isn\u2019t that though. Tatami is completely different. Not only because it feels like one of the pieces of work completely un-reliant on the kind of marketing perpetuated in Japan. But because it is trying to tell a completely different kind of story. Instead of the eventual love-interest being some overly-cute and completely unbelievable piece of meat, she is instead her own person which, through the previously established thread of fate is bound to at least interacting with our protagonist. Now, don\u2019t get the word \u201cinteracting\u201d mixed in with \u201cfalling in love with.\u201d It isn\u2019t that kind of story. \\n\r\nBy the end, the conclusion isn\u2019t that they admit their love for one another after knowing each other for a little bit. It isn\u2019t that she promises to marry him after three days of speaking. It isn\u2019t any of that. It is simply one character asking another character out after they\u2019ve done something nice for them. Yet this seemingly basic conclusion is infinitely more cathartic to me than all the sappy fantasy-fulfillment shlock that I\u2019ve seen before this. For once, I felt like this character is someone I understood. In anime, that is a pretty rare experience for me. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nIf I\u2019m staying vague here, I\u2019m sorry. I must skirt the line between overt analysis and review which I often dislike. Reviewing something is so hollow since every detail that would explain your love or hate of something needs to be obscured by double-meanings and insipid hints. I always try to balance on that threshold because that\u2019s what this is called, a review. I inject a personal analysis because that\u2019s more interesting. Without that, this whole process would feel as though I\u2019m meandering and repeating the same parochial bullshit that you can read anywhere else. \\n\\n\r\nWhat you should know is that The Tatami Galaxy is a special show. It is short, tightly constructed, and extraordinary beyond belief. Not because of its style or its \u201csubstance\u201d, but because it blends the two to create something you don\u2019t just see, but something you feel. You can laugh, relate, and sympathize, but you can ultimately learn about someone. As I\u2019ve said, there are only so many stories that can be told. It is up to you to tell them in ways which someone can siphon a unique context from. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe crossroads\u201d is a common theme in storytelling. A moment in which you choose left or right, up or down, yes or no. The change which engulfs the rest of your own story. That is ultimately what Watashi, and no doubt the rest of us end up experiencing. A crossroad. What kind of choice you make, though, eventually becomes irrelevant because once it is made there is no way to rewind what you experience. At the end, these alternate lives that Watashi lives through are all his own lives with different choices leading to different events unfolding even past the two-year timeframe we get to observe. Yet each one has what you learn to call a moment in which you decide to live exactly how you want to.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned a \u201creversal\u201d earlier on in this review. The reversal of not only two characters, but the acceptance of one idea over another. Yuasa\u2019s belief that regardless of which choice you make you must live with it, and live you must, live happily. Regrets are something to weigh you down. The conclusion, as Watashi bursts forth and sheds the weight that has been burdening him all this time, is that simple. It is a combination of elements shown through every timeline which he\u2019s lived in and deciding choices that he made. \\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is a masterpiece due to its ability to maintain surrealistic elements with an ultimately grounded narrative. But in a more metaphoric and esoteric way, it is a masterpiece because it tells a simple, well-used narrative in a way that conveys the feelings of one person at that time. Whether those feelings are from experience or from fantasy, they are feelings that permeate through the show and tell you what makes someone who they are. The Tatami Galaxy finishes with its opening and begins with its credits. The notion that a story is ending, but another is beginning. This show is just short enough that I can't point out a single misstep in its run-time. The biggest problem with rating television is that you have to judge every single episode. A single misstep in a show, regardless its length can sometimes be detrimental to its rating. Tatami is short though, which gives it enough room to explore its themes but not enough room to lose its story. Which is so spectacular to watch. A love story that doesn't play like a love story, but instead like a mystery. As Watashi wonderfully tells the viewer, \u201cNothing else is as boring to tell as a story of successful love.\u201d \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The Tatami Galaxy is a new anime released by Madhouse animation studios, and a adaptation of a Morimi Tomihiko novel.\r\nThere's two things of very noteable worth in this series. One; is the story. Two; is the animation.\r\nThe story in The Tatami Galaxy is constructed over a episodic nature. As each episode recollectes the main character's last two years of college, but within different social circles or clubs. So every episode plays around the main character going through almost the same events, and meeting the same characters, in each episode. This sounds like it'll become very tedious.. BUT! Unlike Haruhi's Endless Eight, which forces you towatch the same episode 8 times, The Tatami Galaxy plays afew key scenes the same, but the actual journey through each episode is always different. Because of this, each episode feels fresh, and the novelty doesn't slowly wear off and become dull.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the amount of detail that went into this series is staggering. I can almost akkin it to the Watchmen graphic novel, in the sense that the series is scattered with all these little small details and foreshadowing. It's impressive when a episode later in the series will make a callback to a very small scene that happened in the second episode.\\n\\n\r\nThough, something I became seriously impressed with is the ending. Considering the story works in a episodic nature, I had a hard time believing that everything would lead to a beliveable conclusion... I don't want to spoil anything, but it's very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is very simplistic, yet beautiful to look at. It provides a sense of charm and atmosphere for the series. Though, the animation has two things working for it, it uses a intergration of real life stills or videos, and placing animation on in, and, it has a sense of 'exaggeration' that is common placed in most animes, but instead of playing it up for laughs like other animes do, it provides this sense of fantasy or imagination within this universe. The animation is very 'arthouse', if I had to define it to a single term. Which is no surprise, considering Madhouse has always been known for pumping out series with excellent animation behind it.\\n\\n\r\nAs of far, The Tatami Galaxy is one of the most intellectually satisfying pieces of media that I've seen in quite sometime. Even though it's half-way into the new year, I'm going to go ahead and say that this is quite possibly, the best anime I've seen this year. I can't suggest this highly enough.",

            "content": "Whether it be now or earlier in one\u2019s life, there is a moment where we all must look at ourselves and ask the simple, yet difficult to answer, question which is, \u201cWhat do I want to do with my life?\u201d This is a painstaking question that cuts deep down into our psyche and into the very meat of what makes us human. Sure, a question such as this may seem ugly and off-putting to the majority of us, there is no denying that. However, we must still confront this question at some point in our lives with full force, no matter how repetitive the trialsof that question may be. Thus describes the anime known as The Tatami Galaxy, a show based around this simple yet difficult question. What makes The Tatami Galaxy shine with brilliance is its embrace of the embarrassing and irritating repetitions that life throws at us until we finally figure out what we want out of living. \\n\\n\r\n     Atmosphere shines greatly in this anime, causing its story to be a knockout. Much like the show\u2019s nameless main character, The Tatami Galaxy presents to you a story that is set in a surreal, weird, yet incredibly honest, depiction of the world as seen through the eyes of a young college student. We follow this nameless, college-bound protagonist of ours through certain days in his life involving his own misadventures of achieving a \u201crosy-campus life,\u201d filled with no worries and endless fun. What he doesn\u2019t realize, however, is the fact that he is wasting his days away in a seemingly endless time loop. Within each new day within this loop, we experience the many life lessons and intricate people that the protagonist meets along the way. \\n\\n\r\n     These intricate people within the show are just as incredibly well written as the hilariously tragic protagonist. Ozu, the protagonist\u2019s best friend of sorts, is a standout character who perfectly symbolizes the yang to the main character\u2019s yin. Ozu is sly, treacherous and mischievous to the viewer, however, he comes off as incredibly funny and charming towards the many other characters that we meet throughout the show. Because of how he is presented, he manages to trick us and the protagonist into going with many of his wacky and mind-boggling journeys through college life. This makes Ozu a great antithesis towards the protagonist\u2019s views on life and his actions throughout the show. He is an obstacle that the main character must overcome somehow, and it\u2019s great watching how he continuously tries to this during his endless days in college. \\n\\n\r\n     Not only will you find Ozu to be a great character within this show, but the many other members of the cast are just as entertaining and memorable. We as an audience view these many different characters\u2019 complexities and quirks as each and every one of them interact with the main character in certain fashions and events that collide with the main character. As you continue to follow the different lives of the supporting cast, you begin to notice how similar their own lives are compared to the protagonist\u2019s life, in the same since that each of them deal with existential-types of crisis\u2019 in the same vein as the protagonist. This sort of inner relation with the supporting cast along with the protagonist, in my opinion, is what makes The Tatami Galaxy a very memorable show that can help relate to anyone in society. \\n\\n\r\n     What I also find as something that stands out is the obvious breathtakingly surreal art style as well as the directing. You really have to give a round of applause to the artwork in the show, especially because of the fact that it captures the colorfulness as well as the awkward and flabbergasting environment that is known as college. The director of the show, Masaaki Yuasa, also does a beautiful job of capturing amazing, and sometimes hilarious, facial expressions of the many characters as well as impactful scenes that manage to resonate with the audience and prove to be memorable and even tragic. Not only is the directing incredible, but the soundtrack is also full of catchy and quirky songs that present a bit of an irony towards the overall feeling or tone of the show. The opening song of the show is also one of the best opening you could ever find in an anime. \\n\\n\r\n     At the end of the day, the message is what truly matters when it comes to The Tatami Galaxy, which is to \u201cSeize the opportunity that is dangling in front of you\u201d. The show is an ode to all of us young people in society, telling us to never give up on our hopes and dreams and to realize that those hopes and dreams are within our reach, we just need to extend our hand out a little more in order to grasp on to it. This is a message that deeply impacts me and I\u2019m pretty sure that it also impacts yourself as well as the people around us. What you will ultimately get out of this anime is a terrific cast of characters, a memorable art style and atmosphere, an upbeat soundtrack and, most of all, a hint towards the answer that we all seek in our lives, which is what we want out of living. I highly recommend this anime to lovers of surrealism and those who are going through a bit of a personal crisis and find themselves to be stuck within the ever-changing and ever-scary place that is society. \\n",

            "content": "Normally when discussing animation the first name that comes to mind is that of the studio, but in this particular case the director's signature is far more prominent. Masaaki Yuasa is known for forsaking many of the elements traditionally associated with quality animation--detail, consistency, realism--in favor of more minimalistic, free-form style you'd normally only see in an independent film or web animation. The designs are minimalist but still expressive and distinctive. The color choices are bright and diverse but ignore the conventions of shading or lighting, mixed with several unmoving cloth and wallpaper patterns reminiscent of Gankutsuou and a few instances of monochromatic live actionscenery. Now I get to talk about the studio: it may come as a surprise to some that this was animated by Madhouse. This certainly isn't their best work by normal technical standards--frame rates and fluidity are pretty modest--but the studio truly lives up to its name with this creation, managing to make these simple designs pop off the screen with passion and finesse. There are some occasional animation loops and the like here and there, but overall this can stand on par with SHAFT's best artistic efforts. Of course, when an anime's visual style is so prominent, it becomes absolutely crucial that its artistry fit the story it's telling. I'll address that question in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nMusically, the show's track is primarily comprised of light orchestral pieces that manage to support its comedic and dramatic moments equally well. The music itself is nothing you haven't heard before, probably even in other anime, but it generally fits. The show has a habit of reusing some of its tonal motifs regularly whenever a certain situation pops up, but considering the story is built around a Groundhog Day loop I can write that off as part of the joke. It's never abused to the point of becoming a distraction, so overall I can say that this show is perfectly competent in its use of sound.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is always important, but here especially it's absolutely crucial. Though there's no dub, I must tip my hat to the Japanese voice actors for carrying the difficult script so well. Of particular note are Shintaro Asanuma as our protagonist and Keiji Fujiwari as Higuchi, both of whom have lines that require them to speak a mile a minute and manage to deliver them without a hitch. I'm not sure if they had some sound editing to help them along, but good editing only does so much for lackluster performances and even when speaking at a normal pace they still sound quite good. The voice acting as a whole leans a bit toward the cartoonish side but it's never flat or dull. I think this show would benefit from a dub simply because of the amount of subtitles you'll have to read to get through it if you don't know Japanese, even though you'd probably much rather be taking in the show's quirky visuals. In my personal experience, I had to pause the video a few times just to keep up with all the subtitles. Still, that's not to disparage an excellent Japanese voice track. I just hope that if someone (Funimation?) does eventually dub it they'll do the series justice.\\n\\n\r\nSo for all the college students out there in both Japan and abroad who watch and enjoy anime, it's kind of sad and a little surprising how few anime there are that make the effort to address life at this juncture. In recent memory, the only other such series that spring to mind are Moyashimon (which is also unlicensed) and Honey and Clover. As a college student myself, I'll take representation where I can find it. I should probably clarify that The Tatami Galaxy is more about college as a life experience than as an educational institution. That the show chooses this angle, particularly in Japan where the culture leans so heavily on academic achievement (I'm basing this on hearsay, don't quote me on it), is actually quite refreshing, and it certainly becomes more of a boon than a burden, to say otherwise would be missing the point. It could be argued that this show is an achievement simply for its choice of subject matter and for the fresh ground it chooses to tread. But the show also stands out for its style of storytelling. What really holds The Tatami Galaxy together more than anything is the consistency with which it delivers its central metaphor.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, unlike the infamous Endless Eight, the Groundhog Day loop here actually varies its timeline. Most of the recursions, particularly early on, feature similar chains of events aside from the club our protagonist chooses to join, and on the surface it might seem like pointless repetition, but there is an underlying arc that creeps up on the audience over the course of these loops. Each episode gives a different angle on the same events, and small, seemingly pointless details from one cycle can become pivotal plot points in another. To say that every detail in this story has a purpose isn't entirely accurate, at least not from a plot standpoint. Thematically, though, it gets its message across loud and clear as we're shown all the different opportunities that can be found just by slightly shifting our perspective. However, the way to happiness isn't through the missed opportunities of another lifetime; as an old fortuneteller reminds our protagonist every episode, the opportunity to find happiness is always dangling right in front of him. It's a simple message, but the execution is unforgettable, bordering on downright groundbreaking. In many ways, this show seems to deserve a full 10/10, but for all there is to praise here, The Tatami Galaxy has some fairly serious problems.\\n\\n\r\nGetting back to the setting I mentioned earlier, one of the main draws of The Tatami Galaxy is the fact that it addresses college life. Naturally, it's going to ring particularly true to people who have gone to college or are going to college. As an audience, we're expected to sympathize with the characters for the juncture they're at in life, and it works for some people. Still, even though their backdrop makes this easier to overlook, it has to be said: these characters do not act like real people.That's not to say that they're flat, static or archetypal, they are none of these things... and now I need to clarify. Many of the key characters of The Tatami Galaxy have traits common among ordinary college students you may have met, but they tend to come across more as the sum of their traits than as actual, believable people. Hanuki and maybe Higuchi are the most human characters of the cast, but aside from them the motivations we're shown are either simplistic or alien, if not both. Some of them still get their share of development, but when the characters feel like they sprung into existence as college students with no prior life experience you know you're in trouble.\\n\\n\r\nI could have forgiven all that. After all, we're seeing the world through our protagonist's warped perspective, of course he'd fixate on the superficial, but now I get to address the elephant in the room. The astute readers among you may have noticed that I have yet to refer to the protagonist by name. Well, that's because he doesn't have one. Throughout the series he's never once referred to by name (not even a nickname a la Kyon) and he's simply credited as Watashi (Japanese for \"I\" or \"me\"). The intent behind this is obvious: he's supposed to be the everyman we can all relate to. Unfortunately, the writing only half-succeeds at getting this across, and the end result is basically an assemblage of human desires and flaws, and feels more like a symbol of college students in general than any actual college student I've ever met. I'm not saying Watashi isn't likable; he can still be fun to watch, and from time to time you'll probably feel something for him, but sympathizing with a character based on his situation only goes so far.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned earlier that Watashi's perspective is warped, and boy did I mean it. The Tatami Galaxy is at its very best when it utilizes this trait to its full potential, i.e. when there's a discrepancy between what's said and what's shown, or when Watashi shuts up and gives the audience a chance to take in the situation with their own eyes and ears. But this series is based on a novel, specifically a first-person stream-of-consciousness novel. This works well enough early on in the series, when Watashi is stumbling through timelines, misinterpreting his own mistakes and shortcomings, etc. Nor does the use of repetition bother me especially; it's part of the theme, and the meanings of some of the lines he repeats will actually change depending on the context. Still, when a character says in twenty words what could have been communicated in five, it gets frustrating. Worse yet, it's not uncommon for Watashi to explain in intricate detail the conclusion we're expected to draw from the scenario presented. How someone so messed up in the head still manages to be so eloquent is beyond me. We know you're trapped in the \"what-ifs\" of your life, so shut up and do something about it.\\n\\n\r\nThis problem reaches its absolute worst in the last two episodes, specifically the first episode-and-a-half of the last two episodes, where Watashi is forced to confront the manifestation of all the college years he's wasted in all the different lives he's lived. This could have worked if he was more of a character and less of a symbol, but instead we get a mouthpiece spouting explanations for things we should already be able to piece together on our own. If that was all, the conclusion would just be heavy-handed, which wouldn't be so bad, but then Watashi goes on to explain the understanding he comes to about all the other characters and their motivations. Looking back at the nine episodes that preceded, I can understand how the setup is present for many of these character arcs, but having Watashi telegraph his conclusions at us does not wrap them up in a way that feels natural. This is lazy, manipulative storytelling that ignores one of the most basic narrative principles: show don't tell. To be fair, the latter half of the final episode is actually quite fitting, and it successfully ties up the story's central metaphor, but the story's humanity is lost in the process.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who argue that the story doesn't need a human side precisely because it's symbolic: saying it's okay to forsake that element because it's \"a necessary sacrifice\" is not only a pitiful excuse, but also completely untrue. It's not easy or common, but it is perfectly possible to merge metaphor and humanity. Revolutionary Girl Utena did it. FLCL did it. The presentation may be \"avant-garde\", the subject matter may be fresh ground, and to a certain extent I respect it for that, certainly enough to warrant a recommendation, but the lack of a human heart holds this series back from being the masterpiece it could have been. On a more subjective note, I have to wonder if Yuasa's artsy direction was really the best thing for this show. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but at a time when more and more people are going to college and it's becoming a more universal part of growing up, mightn't an earthier, more realistic art style have made the show more accessible to a wider audience? Just food for thought.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all my gripes and frustrations, the series' merits as an allegory are still perfectly valid, and I commend it for that. The reason I emphasized the series' flaws so much in this review isn't that the show is bad, not by any stretch. The Tatami Galaxy is a thoroughly admirable creation that delivers spectacularly on the intellectual front, but never quite reaches for your heart the way it really should, and much like its protagonist it can get pretty far up its own ass. Still, the unique artistry and storytelling set this series apart, and it does have something to offer for anyone who's been to college.",

            "content": "\"There are many, many, many worlds branching out at each moment you become aware of your environment and then make a choice.\"\r\n-Anonymous\r\nThe parallel universe concept is one that has existed for decades, but its freedom in entertainment space makes it just as refreshing each time I come across it. Whether there are multiple, unique universes with the same recurring character like in Black Rock Shooter or a scientist delving back into time trying to alter the present in Steins;Gate, this concept has proven to have unlimited applicability. In The Tatami Galaxy, infamous director Masaki Yuasa (Kaiba, Ping Pong- The Animation) took the idea and combinedit with elements of \"Groundhog's Day\" to create a visual masterpiece that transcends its own narrative.\\n\\n\r\nIf you could go back in time, what would you change?\\n\\n\r\nThe question is very subjective. Most people would expect an obligatory honorable answer like \"I would stop conflict in the Middle East\" or \"I would end world hunger\", but if answered quite honestly our answers would most likely evolve into something trivial or selfish. Our nameless main character isn't seeking to change the world, but instead lets our contemplative minds live vicariously through his parallel universe hopping. He's someone you want to root for, to do what none of us have the ability to. I've made a lot of decisions I regretted in my life, and and I've always wondered how differently things wouldve turned out if I'd have altered just a few things about my past. In The Tatami Galaxy, the question of \"what if?\" is continually revisited in order to achieve the best possible outcome. It does so while also keeping the viewer on alert to spot the difference in details from one episode to the next.\\n\\n\r\nI came into the show with virtually no prior knowledge of its premise, so initially I was struggling to figure out its over-arcing theme or where the plot was trying to go. Then I realized the true beauty of The Tatami Galaxy. There is no clear plot or story but more so a collection of alternate anecdotes that mold their own story. It's an anime that builds off our own experiences and empathy for the main character's college life, a life perhaps similar to our own. Through his circuitous monologues, Mr. Protagonist states what we're thinking and is just as pathetic as we seemed to be in that point of our lives. Judging from my past experiences during that time, the similarities hit me hard. As if suffering from a premature \"midlife crisis\", he ponders about what could've been, and desires above all else to experience a \"rose-colored campus life\" he always dreamed of. It sounds a bit clich\u00e9 but we all wanted the ideal life right?\\n\\n\r\nThrough watching and reviewing anime over the years I've come to realize that comedy is relatively subjective to the viewer. What I find hilarious, you might chalk up as mindless drivel. However, Yuasa's works have taught me that pure, observational comedy can be much more impactful than a well timed joke. As much as you want to feel for our protagonist, his seemingly useless involvement in situations tend to make us chuckle. This combination of humor allots more space for content, vital for a series with only 11 episodes. Most viewers who can't relate to the scenarios faced can at least laugh a bit at his misfortune. And those monologues, man they are something else. The amount of text shelled out in the first episode is daunting to say the least, but if you stay on your toes it's not too difficult to keep track of. It's yet another testament to our protagonist's personality. As the series went on, I enjoyed this aspect much more.\\n\\n\r\nImagine that friend that always seems to get you into trouble, but always has your back at the end of the day. Or perhaps that girl you admired from afar, seemingly way out of your league. The characters in The Tatami Galaxy are incredibly relatable, and no matter what universe our MC is in they seem to fit their trope quite well. That's not to say they aren't complex, in fact I had a difficult time pinpointing what sort of nefarious activity Ozu would get our MC into next, or exactly how Akashi was feeling towards him at any given point. They just seem to hold a certain piece of the puzzle in his life that only they can fill. They're very relatable and likable characters, and one (Ozu) you love to hate. Yuasa even went as far as to personify the MC's \"Johnny\" (who's origin you can leave to your own imagination), which created some rather hilarious situations of angel vs. devil. Undoubtedly Mr. Protagonist gets the most development, but he often appears very \"unnecessary\" to the world he lives in. He stumbles and perseveres through the most ridiculous events, only to rewind and do it all over again. This makes the revelation and self-realization in the ending episode all the more fulfilling from a viewing standpoint (seriously, what was in that castella that kept him nourished?).\\n\\n\r\nJust like every other Yuasa installment, the art is in a league of its own. It's difficult to describe exactly how good or how bad it is because it incorporates elements of so many different styles. If one thing is clear it's that the scenery is pretty to look at. Combining actual still frame images with vivid environments and backgrounds, the artists capture a psychedelic or dreamlike feel, strengthening the parallel universe element. An art style dynamic enough to rival that of the Monogatari in sheer originality. The character models are among some of the best I've seen from Yuasa and aids in illustrating the character's personalities quite well. They even went as far as to showcase the protagonist's perception of Ozu by drawing him a demon-like face. It wasn't sloppy, nor refined. It was just, \"it\".\\n\\n\r\nI didn't really notice the music much throughout the series, but the OP was well animated and fit the theme of the show well. Sometimes anime can get tripped up from this dissimilar OP vs show concept but Tatami nails it. The ED was really interesting, unlike any ending I've heard in awhile. Voice acting was phenomenal on behalf of Mr. Protagonist. His onslaught of verbiage was impressive and cumbersome at the same time. Like I noted previously, it's something you get used to as the series progresses. If this ever gets dubbed, the English voice actor will have some pretty big shoes to fill. I loved the \"Engrish\" speaking sections of some of the episodes, something that always sounds funny no matter how many times I hear it.\\n\\n\r\nUnderstand that while I have high praise for the series, it is not perfect. The setting of a college university will make it much harder to appreciate for younger viewers or those having never gone to college. The dialogue heavy episodes can also be frustrating if you're not paying attention 100% of the time. If you're someone who tends to do other things while watching anime, this might not be the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nBased on my opinion, I give The Tatami Galaxy highest honors when it comes to originality and overall enjoyment. I had an absolute blast watching the series, end it earns my highest recommendation. If you're a fan of Yuasa's other works or you're just looking for a refreshingly unique anime, give it a try. I doubt you'll regret it.",

            "content": "No matter how twisted the life of a human being is, no matter how cruelly providence tosses him around, in the end it all comes down to a simple desire: everyone wants to be accepted, loved. \u201cYoj\u00f4han Shinwa Taikei\u201d (\u201cThe 4.5 Tatami Galaxy\u201d) tells a story of one young man who tries to find a place for himself in a vibrant but chaotic world, meets numerous charismatic companions on the way and finally obtains what he had been searching for since the start.\r\nSTORY (9)\r\n Enter Watashi (\u201cI\u201d), a young and hopeful freshman at a university who is faced with the choice that will determine hisfurther life at the said campus: he has to choose a club to belong to. So he decides, inspired by the colorful dreams of pleasant and carefree existence as a student, yet the reality is nowhere near as bright as his imagination. When all starts going downhill and Watashi cannot cope with the demands of the world around him, the clock spins backwards, stop, reset, he goes back. \u2026wait. He actually goes back in time.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story is based on the same scheme as the overly hyped \u201cHigurashi\u201d series, it is done in a slightly different manner. The catch is that every counterpart of a person he meets retains their personality, but is actually met in different circumstances. The people around him do change their places, yet he feels he does not \u2013 at least not until a certain point in his life, but that is something that has to be seen for oneself. From the good introduction and right until the perfectly developed ending, the story is a strong \u2013 if not the strongest - focus of this series.\\n\\n\r\nART (7)\\n\r\nAlthough very impressionistic and fluid, the art doesn\u2019t shock. Remembering the very promising promo artworks that came out ages ago and thinking to myself \u201chey, this is going to be one interesting series, better watch it\u201d, I feel slight bitterness when I feel it is rushed at times, but what pains me the most is that it\u2019s nothing that hasn\u2019t been seen before. Sure, simplicity at its best \u2013 sophisticated graphic design does not necessary make a good series, but improving it wouldn\u2019t hurt at all, would it? Fortunately, it is not anything that would subtract from the brilliance of \u201cYoj\u00f4han Shinwa Taikei\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8)\\n\r\nWhat strikes in this case, are the perfect opening and ending sequences. A little gift to fellow Asian Kung-Fu Generation fans, the show features a song that goes perfectly with the general mood prevalent throughout, making the opening animation truly an integral part of it. The ending, on the other hand, ties perfectly into the finishing scenes of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting here, ah. It\u2019s professional, suits the show and shows the many sides of the characters effectively. Shintaro Asanuma who played the part of Watashi reigns here. Indeed, his lines are something that needs some accustoming to (\u201cman, slow down, this is killing me\u201d was what I thought at the very beginning), but later on they become a masterpiece, giving this show a certain feeling that can\u2019t be found in its equivalents. It is just as if the main character had too much to say and too little time. I got the feeling it was natural.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (8)\\n\r\nAnother strong issue. There is no single unlikable character in this colourful show. Whether it\u2019s one of the leads, or the big cast of supporting figures, they all feel as if they belong there, no matter what their role would be. Out of the trio Watashi-Akashi-Ozu, the protagonist may seem the dullest, but the journey he goes is far from boring. Akashi, his ideal raven-haired maiden, is an outspoken young lady with a particularly nasty fear of moths; it is, however, Ozu that drives the craziness, accelerating it by his mischievous doings, successfully making Watashi\u2019s life even more difficult than it already is.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYoj\u00f4han Shinwa Taikei\u201d has also a well-developed cast of supporting characters, as mentioned before, whose stories intertwine with Watashi\u2019s existence, often in troublesome ways. The most interesting part is always finding out what happens to whom in each part \u2013 situations change, but personalities remain strong.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (8)\\n\r\nWatashi\u2019s monologues killed me at first. I started watching and was reluctant to continue; it wasn\u2019t long, though, until I resumed the show and was taken by surprise. And it was a very positive surprise. Seeing a show like this is rare nowadays, one that may not be most innovative in its category, but it certainly is captivating and inspirational. Before I noticed, the series was over and I could only sigh. Spring 2010 was a good time for anime and \u201cYoj\u00f4han Shinwa Taikei\u201d contributed to it remarkably.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (8)\\n\r\nWatch it. Be prepared, but watch it nevertheless. The show is like a breath of fresh air \u2013 it\u2019s a revitalising, pleasant experience.

I won't spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen it yet, but the grand culmination is one that brings with it the potential to drown you in your own happy tears.\r\nNow, a notable thing about this anime is its incredible pace, which is both a blessing, since you get twice as much material per episode, and a curse, if you don't have a background in Japanese. Either way, watching this anime requires your utmost focus to details, andthe artwork is \"simplistically beautiful.\"\\n\\n\r\nBeyond anything, the message of this anime is the best reason to watch it, as it teaches you to recognize that all you ever wanted is right before your eyes, and trying to pursue a \"rose-colored campus life\" won't always bring what you expect. After all, life is full of twists and turns, and trying to follow the trodden path will ultimately limit your infinite options. Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei brings to light the value of being an individual through beautiful social constructs, dynamic artwork, and a lesson that truly permeates the essence of living life to the fullest.",

            "content": "An insight into University life the parents knew to be true but is afraid to admit it is how their children might end up. The Tatami Galaxy introduces these horrors directly to their well-groomed kids in the form of an educational, animated series. It is informative, illuminative and it is to be laughed at.\r\nReleased two years after Kaiba, directed by the same man; no anime had my eyes roll faster in reading subtitles. Even Shaft productions required assistance in the form of wall scribbles.\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is an unusual storytelling of an unnamed, 20 year-old student, participating in club activities to find true love. Wesaw the most important and life defining moments over his two years at University from different propositions. Each time, I laughed at his miserable attempts to see rainbows and roses only to ultimately steer into the same hole, drenched, forever alone. We know him only as \u201cWatashi\u201d, a pessimist, with the power to turn back time and re-run his life. Throughout the 11 episodes, the MC continues to do so until he reaches a point of satisfaction. For a series based around a student and campus life, the protagonist was hardly seen attending lectures and there were little University specific relations. Like watching the life of a true college dropout, which to be fair, he was. A stereotypical good-for-nothing, unexpectedly, meets up for the \u201cvery first time\u201d, but on multiple occasions, with Ozu, his compatriot, who is very sly and is a great talker. He is also an ogre. Instead of being the MC\u2019s right-hand man to help him hit on girls he so desperately desires, Ozu only brings \u201cWatashi\u201d bad luck and misery. Each time our protagonist presses the reset button, Ozu always, somehow, tracks him down as if they were connected by a \u201cblack thread of fate\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe life of \u201cWatashi\u201d is so depressing it makes most viewers feel lucky. Betrayed by friends and had his brand new bike stolen in front of his eyes, he wasn\u2019t able to enjoy the simple things many of us take for granted. The only roads for a character such as him to head to are pretty obvious, even for a 13-year old. While this might explain why the series is rated PG-13, \u201cWatashi\u2019s\u201d and Ozu\u2019s characters should not be mistaken as plain or transparent. For these two characters reveal different sides of their personalities more towards the ends of the series and might surprise some. The supporting characters pop up whenever necessary for repeated performances or otherwise, but were mainly there to provide us with humour and create new playgrounds for the director to plant foreshadow and clever linkages. Their relationships with the main character were never allowed to build upon because the restart button was applied episodically. Having said that, the director had to allow some elements from the previous dealings to seep through in order for him to produce a complete conclusion; the result is our characters act as if they have some sort of partial amnesia.\\n\\n\r\nAkashi might not be a tsundere but she certainly is one of the coldest girls out there. She is not the best looking but then again, the art style is not the right instrument to make her so. The only other living creature with her face shown was Ryouko Hanuki, who has really long eye lashes and a decent fashion sense. She is older than Akashi and is more mature. Her face matches proudly to her figure and is without a doubt, the hottest character in the series. As a PG-13, The Tatami Galaxy has some arousing scenes and mature scripting that are probably not appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nSimple and jagged drawings standing in front of real-life imageries could be considered abstract art to some, keeping in tune with Yuasa Masaaki's other works, it is an acquired taste. If it was committing to the same art style as the original creator, then fair enough. But The Tatami Galaxy is based on a novel so the art gets no sympathy from me. It was nowhere near as fluid as Kaiba. Many scenes are in black & white; especially when the protagonist is alone. Other scenes are sepia or unusually coloured like different roses as if everything on screen is dyed into the same colour. Sound-wise is very average, the sound director didn't need to work very hard as all he needed to do was play the lone voice of \u201cWatashi\u201d half the time.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme songs are played behind tatami multiplying like bacteria and Yakushimaru's cute voice for the ending theme song was always looked forward to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy has some great scripting, often genius and amusing. But such long winded conversations and monologues require obligatory scenes to fit the screen time. The fast monologue in a different language is annoying. I like Japanese rap songs but this, without some beats, is mere noise. By around seven's episode it started to hurt my ears. If it was fast dialogue between two or more people, it might have been acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nThere should be an Art/Cultural genre defining series such as these which often teaches its viewers meanings of life and remind us of what is out there in life. There are two ways of looking at this series; call it intelligently written for episodes are connected with reused scenes and situations, or label it as making-up new acts to reach the same rundown. The second one looks more reasonable for many episodes have too many plot holes in their attempts to link and filling gaps are never smooth. But realistically, it's a combination of both.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode has many questions answered but the Time Lord element was there for viewers to accept without challenge. A surprise end to the series which changed my preferences of certain characters and my attachments to some, felt like a run-and-hit and even a little done by. But thinking back, I realised it was a sagacious piece of work that deserved some praise.\\n\\n\r\nA very monologue and dialogue heavy series that doesn\u2019t have enough action to play out, protagonist talks to its viewers on-air and asks questions we ask ourselves. What felt like a taunting task to watch was quite rewarding at curtain call. Not a bad anime for a small cast with cheap production, but it made me work hard with few immediate rewards in between.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked this, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei is a good bet.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Thanks to Vis4Vanity for recommending this series)",

            "content": "A common misconception is that being experimental makes your work inaccessible. Too many experimental works got this reputation, and too many people now think difficulty is praiseworthy. It\u2019s as if jumping through 50 hoops somehow increases the value of 20 dollars. It may increase perceived value, but that\u2019s not the same. It just means your mind distorted the real value so you won\u2019t feel bad about wasting time.\r\nDifficulty can\u2019t be the main aim of any piece of art. Art is a way to communicate ideas. The reason we seek these experimental/non-traditional/avant-garde methods is not because of their difficulty. These new approaches are meant to enhancea story, to shed new light on the same ideas. Experimentation shouldn\u2019t draw you away from an anime, it should make you curious and involved in it.\\n\\n\r\nTatami Galaxy is a perfect example of an anime that\u2019s both experimental and, at the same accessible. It follows a non-linear narrative, whose structure has significant meaning. The characters all look weird, but that\u2019s only makes them more lively. The characters themselves are weird, but people are weird. All their quirks aren\u2019t there just to make them different from one another, but related directly to their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nJougaski\u2019s love for a doll is directly related to how he\u2019s an idol for women. Akashi is cold and intelligent, but it doesn\u2019t help her when moths are around. Ozu is a scumbag, but even scumbags like him can love.\\n\\n\r\nThe way they are drawn is also important to their personality. Anyone who thinks character design isn\u2019t important has no business watching anime, with Tatami Galaxy a strong argument for the importance of character design. The designs are expressive for their personalities \u2013 Jougaski looks perfect, Akashi is pretty in a low-key way, Higuchi looks both absent-minded and too wise to care. Look at the shut eyes and the small smile. It\u2019s right between a wise master and an oblivious buffoon.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs are both cartoonish and realistic at the same, and that\u2019s whole approach of the show. It manages to be realistic by being cartoonish. Too many times we see attempts at realism by being \u2018low-key\u2019, like in Mushishi or Texhnolyze. In order to be \u2018realistic\u2019 you first have to ask yourself what is the reality your story is about. Then you seek methods, techniques, and cues that make us believe in your reality.\\n\\n\r\nLife is weird, but college life is especially weird. It\u2019s not a matter of life and death, but it\u2019s a constant chase after an ideal. Even outside college, the dream of a life of constant partying, joy and excitement is common.\\n\\n\r\nIn the age of social media, this theme of \u2018rose-colored life\u2019 is more common. People often post only the good stuff and inflate them. We follow celebrities more closely than ever. Sometimes celebrities rise out of that social media. As a satire of that desire, Tatami Galaxy is dead-on.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not so much about choices, because whatever Watashi chooses the results remain fairly similar. It\u2019s also not about some big philosophy about Destiny and Fate, because every time Watashi fails it\u2019s in different ways. The reason he fails so much is because of his desire. This dream of the rose-colored life is his undoing.\\n\\n\r\nWhether it exists or not, the anime doesn\u2019t answer. It shouldn\u2019t, since easy answers have no place in a great story like this. What it asks us to do look beyond our huge ambitions. The vivid, wacky art style is meant to portray a reality that\u2019s varied, full of weirdness and ups and downs. Notice how the colors constantly change. Life can\u2019t be \u2018rose-colored\u2019. It has too many colors.\\n\\n\r\nThe message is, thankfully, not just \u2018enjoy your life and be thankful for it\u2019. As I said, there\u2019s no room for easy answers in stories that ask questions. Failure is a running theme and the anime is aware you can\u2019t avoid failure and how painful it is. Characters who should lead \u2018rose-colored life\u2019 don\u2019t lead them. Jougaski has plenty of things that make him \u2018not a real man\u2019. Hanuki may be a sexy, fun woman but she still falls into bad relationship. Ozu may be cunning, but he can also fall apart when loves takes over.\\n\\n\r\nAll the colors, weirdness, and personification of a sex drive only lead to one conclusion. Life is a mess. You can enjoy it not by stop aspiring. You don\u2019t even need some sort of \u2018mythical balance\u2019. The world is full of things, of Ozu\u2019s who will knock us down and Higuchi\u2019s who will babble nonsense. It\u2019s about trying to enjoy it despite all these things, to sort out the mess and find what fits you. You can be life-affirming without being shallow\\n\\n\r\nSome have pointed out that the monologues can be too fast. At first it\u2019s annoying, but it quickly dies down. Watashi still talks pretty fast, but the monologues become less dominant and slightly slower. It was easy getting over.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is worth all the hype surrounding it. It manages to be so many things at the same time, and never losing control. It\u2019s realistic without being dry. The narrative is experimental, but in a meaningful way rather than an obscure one. The character design is weird, but it\u2019s for expressive purposes. For all the reputation it gained as an \u2018intellectual anime\u2019, it\u2019s so accessible I\u2019d recommend it to anyone, even people who aren\u2019t into anime.\\n\\n\r\n5 tatami rooms out 5",

            "content": "\"Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today.\" - James Dean\r\nThat's what Tatami is all about, for real. It gets such a high score on MAL, widely being praised everywhere, because The Tatami Galaxy also speaks to the audience about this, and some people is just really a perfectionist in the first place which makes the unnamed protagonist (Watashi) relatable for them.\r\nHaving a message to convey to the audiences doesn't equate to a good story, and having surreal and \"distinctive\" artstyle doesn't mean the artstyle is good. But still needless to say, they exists here, and it adds up some meritfor it. And in the end, fun things are fun.\\n\\n\r\nSo here it is guys, my updated review of Tatami Galaxy, and of course, it's still a 6/10. Keep in mind that spoilers will be inevitable for this review due to Tatami Galaxy's story structure, which is some perfectionist guy keep resetting time to redo his 2 years to seek for the perfect life he refer as \"Rose colored campus life\", and episode 1-10 shows how he began his new life in a different club after his attempt to reset time.\\n\\n\r\nMy first problem for Tatami is well, it doesn't really have a genre in which it excel itself upon. I've seen better mysteries (Haruhi, Shinsekai Yori, etc), I've seen WAY more better romances (Honey & Clover, Spice & Wolf, Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, even Kimi ni Todoke which is a really simple romance, etc), and also I've seen many better comedies (Inferno Cop, Kill la Kill, etc). \\n\\n\r\nThe characterization of this anime was viewed from Watashi's perspective, each time he resets time, you'll find more characters and learn more about the already introduced character about their life, and of course this protagonist develops from his stubbornness in the very end, which resonates well with the story theme, adding the quality merits of the show remarkably. But aside on Watashi's character development and one life lessons it constantly emphasized upon on how there is no perfections in life, I don't see anything special about this anime. Perhaps I have never experienced things like Watashi did, but for sure, a lot of people do. If you found the protagonist really relatable with you, then good for you, since according to the fans, it's the charm of this series. Unfortunately, I failed to perceive it so.\\n\\n\r\nGoing deeper through this series, I'd like to say that I got pretty disappointed knowing that the time travel cause has never been explored (well some people complaint upon ERASED on being so but then hey why didn't anyone who complaint about it got bothered with Tatami), and I found that none of the characters have any backstory to justify why they acted like that, which the most important thing for me goes to the protagonist himself, since he was so stickler to his \"Rose colored campus life\". One doesn't simply become so idealistic to their life like him out of nowhere, IMO. Side characters here can barely attach to me because the story being too protagonist-centric. The side characters is nothing abysmal, they have their quirks quite well, but nothing really fleshed out, but it's totally understandable since the narrations is Watashi-centric, which sadly, crash with one of its themes presentation, which leads to my biggest issue with The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest complaint for The Tatami Galaxy of mine, is the romances, which this part is that I should say it's below average. Sure the show trying to imply to us that you can't do the impossible (this is why I wonder on why people who likes Tatami likes TTGL) and just chase the best opportunity that this world has offered you, but is his final choice really the best opportunity for Watashi that he can do after the 2 years? No, not for me. Regarding this opportunity, I wouldn't deny that it's heavily revolve with the romance, since one of Watashi's prior goals is to \"find a long raven haired girl\". And here's where I think, the buildup to make said \"opportunity\" interesting is poorly executed. Why? Let's see into the character persona now. Which one is more talkactive? Watashi or Ozu? It's Ozu right? Extroverted guy should get along with introverted girl, because it gives a nice romance dynamics, as one would be the talker and the other would be more of a hearer. This was spoken by me as an introverted guy myself. I like assertive girl more than the silent one, and that's should be the opposite for those guys who talks much IRL. Pairing an introvert with an introvert would be bad as hell, as noone would take the initiative to do something. There is one girl which is really assertive (shown on episode 6-8), which is for me, the better couple for Watashi. You might say that Watashi has been given an opportunity (the mochiguman) to get with his goal, and I have to admit that this empowered said opportunity value by a bit, but is that mean that he doesn't have one with others? I don't think so, if he just didn't run on the episode 6-8, he will be hers. The winning girl character seems to have attached to most of the viewers as how I see that she got much favorites too here on MAL, about 65% compared to the protagonist Watashi, but she just don't stick well with me. Throwing one or two scene where she talked with him can't make me attached to a character (like I said before, other characters are barely affectionate), besides the fact that I never liked ice-cold personality in the first place, there's always exceptions. One of my favorite characters is a tsundere which is well, a trope that I used to generally dislikes even more, but the story can make me emotionally attached to her thanks to how it gives her a lot of perspectiveness, which Tatami lacks of besides having explore other characters activities on each loop. Love is a double-sided relationship, and failing to achieve this means that makes a bad love story.\\n\\n\r\nAnother part I dislike is that he went to a sex doll which isn't even his belongings first (episode 7) before seeking through his penfriend (episode 8). A sane person will do the contrary for me. It might be not that important for some people but that scene is what infuriates me the most to this anime that I give a heavy facepalm.\\n\\n\r\nAside for my \"rant\", I actually enjoyed some moments of this anime, notably the end of episode 1 when he got his first misfortune, and how Ozu appears out of nowhere. So that means it's not that it gives me cringe from the beginning of the story until the end but rather, has a mixed feelings on it in terms of enjoyment. People often complaint on how fast the protagonist narrates the story and that's not necessarily a problem to me, but yeah here goes my reminder for it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the OST, I can't say much, the OP is pretty refreshing, people usually liked the ED more, but it was just not for me. Some people also tend overanalyze on how on the last episode when the protagonist realized what he have done all the time and gained resolve to fix it, it's intentionally reversed to create the image that his way of thinking already been changed from being a dreamer to an opportunity seeker, but for me it's just how like most anime is, many other anime has their last episode OP played when the story ends too. And to be frank, the OP of episode 1-10 hints on the twists happens on episode 10, but can still keep it subtle that it won't spoils you like many other OP/EDs.\\n\\n\r\nPeople generally attracted to its wacky and surreal artstyle because its \"distinctive\" but surrealism=/=instantly good for me, and moreover has a two off-model scenes which I used to rant a lot about it (The weird elbow shape on episode 10 and the bag disappearance) but I don't really care that much as for now, but more of because it's being surreal just for the sake of being surreal. My favorite series of all time is heavily surreal and it has a very good reasons of it because it was told from the perspective of a character who has a severe delusions. I also don't mind with supernatural anime or any anime where the character is getting high for being surreal but in the end, Tatami doesn't have any of it. It's just an anime about how a guy strives for ideal life which will never going to happen. But that doesn't make that the art is horrible, it just doesn't adds so much to the quality (it adds a bit, really).\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if you might been this idealist or perfectionist before but well I never have great expectations for life afterall. Also other personal reasons is that I'm a firm believer that romance relationship is once in a lifetime commitment so once again I have to reiterate my statement that, Watashi's final decisions is kinda, eh? But in the end, The Tatami Galaxy tries to destroy how many people expects too much about life, which makes you can relate to the protagonist much. It's a great message, I like it so much despite not struck me like other audiences, but the presentation of this theme to the story is just, meh.\\n\\n\r\nSo well if you feel like you're just a normal or below average guy who has been an idealist all the time, I recommend this anime for you highly. But if you look for a story which cares a lot about character dynamics, and want to also being attached to the side characters, or want a story that has a detailed explanation about how the world works, this series is weak on it so don't go for this one and just watch something like Legend of the Galactic Heroes where there is an actual narrator who become a Mr. Exposition with bunch of episodes and casts. But which elements does a great story must consists of for you? A detailed exposition which covers up all questions you have with even characterization? Or those that speaks to the audiences? Certainly both for me, but if I have to choose, I'll go with the former, unless the story intended to end it with an open interpretations.",

            "content": "The Tatami Galaxy (also known as Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei) is a series presented in an unorthodox way about the protagonist\u2019s struggle to reach his idea of paradise: a rose-colored campus life overflowing with glory and rapture. As he enters college, he is optimistic for the perfect campus life and \u201craven-haired maiden.\u201d Perhaps too optimistic. Each time he tries to reach his dream, he falls too short and rues the choices he made. But along the way, the young adult begins to mature as a person, as his journey of self-discovery leads him to respect and embrace the decisions he has made. He comes to discoverwhat happiness and paradise truly are, and that they were in front of him the whole time.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nTatami Galaxy is a story about our protagonist, simply known as \u201cWatashi,\u201d entering college hopeful for the promising \u201crose-colored campus life\u201d that awaits him. The story is refreshing in that it\u2019s very unique and gives the watcher a sensation very different from other anime, and deviates significantly from the typical anime. It is episodic in the sense that each episode tells a different path that the main character takes to reach his \u201crose-colored campus life.\u201d Each decision he makes is met with disaster, and the main character regrets his decisions, wanting to redo what he has done with his life. At the end of the episode, time spins backwards and the next episode he chooses a different path. He repeats this process over and over again, never reaching his paradise.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is unique in its own way. Watashi takes different paths by choosing different clubs ranging from the film circle \u201cMisogi\u201d ruled by its narcisstic leader to the secret society known publically as the \u201cLucky Cat Chinese Restaurant,\u201d that is involved with underground activity such as robbing bikes. No episode failed to deliver a compelling and hilarious story. Viewers will laugh continuously as they ride the main character\u2019s train of thought about the world around him, and they learn more about each character throughout the different episodes. Though each episode initially seems to not be intertwined with the others (leading to the show\u2019s episodic feel), they are all brought together in the last few episodes when we piece together the different parts of the series to find its overall moral. Overall the story was singularly and elegantly presented, and the conclusion that weaves everything together, leaving the viewer in astonishment. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\t\\n\r\nThe characters are another part of what make Tatami Galaxy a new experience. Many character has a peculiar trait that makes him or her fun and unique, and some characters are complex and are more than just a personification of just their personality. We see the world\u2019s view in Watashi\u2019s perspective and hear many of his rapid introspective monologues, often of which are amusingly sarcastic. It should also be noted that Watashi is a very real character, someone who many viewers can relate to and understand, which is quite a rarity in anime. Ozu is an enigmatic same-year college student and a friend of Watashi\u2019s. He is a ubiquitously mischievous person who takes joy in causing mischief to other people everywhere. He is tied to Watashi by the \u201cblack string of fate\u201d and happens to cause trouble in all of Watashi\u2019s lives. He is hilarious yet mysterious, as there are many secrets about him that are not initially known. Akashi is an intelligent girl from the engineering department who Watashi has the most interest in. She is witty and sometimes cold, somewhat similar to Hitagi from Bakemonogatari, though not nearly as extreme. Many side characters also had their quirks that made them funny, and no characters were particularly poorly done, but I\u2019ll let you find out more about them yourself.\\n\\n\r\nWatashi\u2019s development and his self-discovery through this series were outstanding, but unfortunately the others didn\u2019t develop quite as much. Nevertheless, the characters were a strong point in the series, and part of what makes it so disparate.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is another part of what sets the Tatami Galaxy apart from other anime. It is very different and yet so apposite of the story it\u2019s telling. It adds a psychological and surreal effect in the overall feeling of the anime. It uses colors that are generally bright and ignore conventional shading/lighting, which gives off the atmosphere\u2019s levity. It wasn\u2019t incredible by any means, but nonetheless it is still good. Overall, it is nicely and amazingly apt.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound is top-notch and the OP/ED capture the mood of the show. The OP \u201cMaigonu to Ame no Beat\u201d is very catchy and nice to listen to. The mood and lyrics of the song captures the heart of the whole series and is very appropriate. The ED (which has stunning visuals) is more atmospheric and dark, nicely expressing the feeling the audience gets at the end of each episode.  The OST\u2019s, however, aren\u2019t as great and don\u2019t get much further than just being background music. The voice-acting is also well-done and the actors do well to convey the feelings of the characters. The incredible speed may be a little offsetting to starters, but it\u2019s easy to get used to after a while.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed every minute of this series. The different and yet deft form of storytelling, the extraordinary characters that never fail to amuse, and the beautiful audiovisuals converge to create this fantastic series. The Tatami Galaxy is a perfect example of \"a diamond in a coal mine,\" and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to watch something masterfully different. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.\\n\\n\r\n \u201cOpportunity is always dangling in front of you.\u201d So, why not grab it?",

I mean, a belly is warm, a belly is comfortable, and in a belly you don't have to do anything in particular, just live and have fun with your umbilical cord.\r\nIt's really a shame we can live in there for only 9 months, before coming out in the real world.\r\nSo, what is The Tatami Galaxy, and what did it attempt to do?\r\nIt's a show just about an average life, of an average guy, trying to get out of the shell, grasping opportunities,and maybe being happy. \\n\r\nHave you ever felt that something was amiss in your life, that you actually never took any real choices? \\n\r\nThis anime is about that feel. And tried in some ways or another, to deal with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple: we're in the shoes of our MC without a name, Watashi for the friends, a college freshman, that thought that entering a club would finally make his real life begin. \\n\r\nWe don't need an introduction: every episode loops, showing us a different variation of Watashi's life, basing on his initial club choice, and we're to get acquainted bit by bit to the ambientation and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters - Ozu is a special case - are more like a furniture to the setting, as we're to get to know the cast through the filter that is Watashi. They're great tho, the slice-of-life sequences source of fun, is them. I'd say that the plot is character-driven, but seen the nature of the anime, it's more Watashi-driven: his choice determine who he'll meet, and with whom he'll develop some sort of relationship. \\n\\n\r\nThis adaptation is by Madhouse, 'nuff said.\\n\r\nArt-wise, or better, visuals-wise, it's an atipical work, for sure. The character animation is simplicistic, nothing too fancy, but it's in combination with various tecniques, like the coloured filters, or the occasional character and photographed background contrast that made the style really neat.\\n\r\nHigh-level direction, Madhouse skilled with adaptations, trust them. Even if sometimes things like Chaos;Head get out, they promised to not fail anymore.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR it is definitively a good ride, the insights and the growth of Watashi are depicted with great realism and the comedy is gold. Watch it for the gum massage if you have this fetish.\\n",

            "content": "Tatami Galaxy is, all at once, genuinely funny, nihilistically depressing, mind numbing, thought provoking, and beautiful.\r\nIt follows a protagonist who is only ever referred to as \"me\" and \"senpai\" through his first 2 years of college, repeated over and over again. The formula for each episode is quite simple: the path of the story is dictated by what co-curricular circle he chooses on his first day, the (mis)adventures he partakes in said circle is then chronicled with very obvious ties to the other alternate realities peppered here and there, and it ends with him feeling dissatisfied with his campus life, deciding that if he haddone so-and-so instead, he would not have wasted it. Then the clock rewinds.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of anime which follow a set routine like this often have trouble making every single episode worth sitting through (yes, Jigoku Shoujo S1, I'm looking at you). However, Tatami Galaxy makes every story unique enough, with just enough connections and surface-level symbolism to make it enjoyable, and perhaps more importantly, interesting. Watching an episode, or even a repeated segment, never feels like a chore, and the captivating minimalistic but vibrant art style has a lot to do with it as well. The visuals do an amazing job capturing the essence of what needed to be delivered while keeping it simple enough not to distract from the narrative story going on.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you find any of it boring, to whatever extent for whatever reason, the finale makes everything worth it. When the message the series hammers at for 9 episodes builds itself up to suspenseful levels and finally expels itself in an flurry (of moths), there is an unmatched feeling of satisfaction. Now, some wonder if the central motif was all they were trying to deliver or there is some deeper message, but I think that's the best thing about this series \u2013 it doesn't matter. Because this is one of the very rare anime that you can analyse into the bloody ground, or just enjoy for what it is and still have a great time anyway. Personally, I feel its main point was to send the central message but it can branch out into many smaller motifs represented to visual symbols here and there.\\n\\n\r\nEither way it is a fantastic and entertaining watch, there is little reason not to. After all if there's anything to take away from the series, it's that you regret what you don't do more than what you do.",

            "content": "I sweat bullets in anticipation as I prepare to write a review for Tatami Galaxy, also known as The Mythological Chronicles of the 4\u00bd Tatami Room\". It is by director Masaaki Yuasa, known for his art house works in anime such as Kaiba and Ping Pong the Animation. I am not nervous because the anime is bad, quite the opposite. It is because I feel unqualified to review it. All I seek is the rose colored critic life. Nevertheless I decided I was to embark headfirst into this feat. To review Tatami Galaxy, as the name was simplified for the United States out of fearof being too complicated (Though that certainly didn't help), I knew I had to explain what it was about, and I find that a difficult task. I should explain Tatami Galaxy is adapted from the novel of the same name. It is a genre bending existentialist comedic drama about an unnamed and unreliable narrator who tries to live the rose colored campus life and fails miserably. He wishes for the two years he wasted to be redone. Each episode is set in a parallel universe in which he chose a different school club, ultimately meeting the same people in varying circumstances. Meanwhile, it is implied that he is apart of a cosmic bet placed upon him, a mysterious girl named Akashi, and a mischievous devil-faced boy named Ozu by the Japanese God of matchmaking to see if the protagonist or Ozu will win the heart of Akashi. Oh, and it deals with the timeless themes of angst, apathy, and the general hopelessness that plagues many college-bound youth, although the demographic is very leaning towards Japanese. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 10/10 \\n\r\nOkay that wasn't so hard after all. Was it hard reading that chunk of a paragraph? That's the best way I can describe the anime is by trying to replicate its pace and content. It is no secret Tatami Galaxy is not very accessible. It is notorious for its extremely faced pace both in speech and direction and the massive amounts of dense exposition thrust onto the viewer at all angels. The anime is only eleven episodes long but at a slower pace it could easily fill 26 episodes. However, the fast pace is not an issue to me, and it reflects the hectic college lifestyle and holds firm to the idea that time flies when you're having fun. \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode of Tatami Galaxy begins the same except from one significant choice. The choice made in each episode creates a nearly totally different outcome. It sounds very repetitive, but each scenario is fun and unique enough to stand on its own. This is no \"Endless 8\" level bullshit, although there is a period of the anime consisting of three episodes that are a tad too similar. This is not a problem to em since they were still damn funny episodes. The protagonist's quest to find the rose colored campus life is one of the most delightfully mad and subjective you'll ever experience and he plot is filled with enough literary techniques to make an AP English grader step back. Couple this original and hilarious set-up with a drastic turn of events come the final few episodes and one of the most surprising and satisfying endings I've ever seen and you've got a damn perfect story. It is short and complex enough to command constant re-watches without ever feeling like it's being dragged on. It is one of the most poignant and poetic stories I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10 \\n\r\nLet's face it. Yuasa anime artstyle is just not for everyone. Luckily, despite its bizarre setup, Tatami Galaxy has probably the most tame of Yuasa's art. Each frame of Tatami Galaxy is pure art. There's simply not much else to say about it. Unque, imaginative, like a fever dream masterwork of the greatest of surreal painters. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND : 10/10 \\n\r\nI did not notice the soundtrack at all, which means it did its job perfectly. The OP and ED are also spot on perfect for the show, both dealing with the show's themes of apathy, paranoia, and angst in drastically different tones. The voice acting is also some of the best I've ever heard in anime. It is very commendable given how fast every character speaks, and the emotion put into it despite the rushed speech is strong and the clarity kept intact. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10 \\n\r\nWhen one of the characters is a personification of the protagonist's penis as a cowboy named Johnny, is there any other reason not to talk praise? Laughing aside, the protagonist is one of the most developed and thought provoking figures to ever grace anime. Part of what makes this so is his reputation as an unreliable narrator. What is real? What is fantasy? You will never know. The narrator doesn't know at least. He is sassy and sex crazed but also deeply humble, proud, and innocent. He is someone anyone reading this review will relate to somehow. \\n\\n\r\nTo counter him is the character of Ozu, who can easily be considered the villain or the series, or the closest thing to it. Ozu is the protagonist's crony, always getting him into trouble. Think of a more sinister version of Eddy from Ed, Edd, n Eddy. He absolutely steals the show in every scene he's in and his ending is also beyond satisfying. The girl Akashi is unique and serves her purpose as a plot device perfectly while also being compelling as an individual. Other characters, such as a jock filmmaker who hides a strange fetish, a troubled female dentist, and the Japanese God himself (OR IS HE?!) are just as colorful as the colors of their surroundings. My only complaint is the dentist mentioned before, who aside from one very very funny quirk is a rather generic archetype of \"sad sexy young adult alcoholic\" \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10 \\n\r\nTatami Galaxy is one of the most no holds barred insane thrill rides I've ever had with a series. It's insightful but never preachy. It's both a mindless juvenile comedy and a poignant work of art. It never feels pretentious or fake and is never \"too deep\" to have fun with. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10\\n\r\nTo me it is a monstrosity very very few have heard of this anime, and even fewer have actually watched it. I consider it to be easily the greatest of the 2010'a thus far, which places it high on my list of greatest of all time. It is not for everyone without a doubt, but Tatami Galaxy is to me one of the greatest artistic achievements told through a visual medium. The great Demo D couldn't describe it better, \"It's a love story, but not really. It's a simplistic coming of age and understanding of ones self but also a complex cerebral commentary wrapped up in fast comedy, colorful symbolism, brief Japanese mythology, and quirky characters and situations that you won't find anywhere else\". It's a story we all can relate to but is just bizarre enough to completely alienate and isolate us. It's a story that makes you think and learn just as the protagonist does. Tatami Galaxy is one of the most fun experiences I've had with an anime. In just 11 episodes it packs a comedic and emotional punch and not only brings up interesting philosophy but goes above and beyond and actually explains why these philosophies are relevant and what they mean in the real world. You're a fool if you don't give Tatami Galaxy at least a chance.",

            "content": "If I wanted to sell the story short I would compare it to the works of Haruki Murakami: cerebral, experimental, magical, full of an indescribable melancholy, and always rooted deeply in literature and Japanese culture. Of course Tatami Galaxy isn't a novel by this writer and it's evident because it's not filled with mystical magical dreamgirls trying to romance our nameless protagonist. With the exception, maybe, of a certain love doll.\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy was off-putting at first for its rapid-fire speech (hold on let me read these darn subtitles) and I actually quit after a couple episodes only to revisit to find I'd made aterrible mistake.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I'm bold in saying it's a unique approach to the medium--not just anime, but animation entirely. The characters and environments are drawn in this wonderfully flat style, something like a very old western cartoon in its expressiveness and simplicity. It's a break from similar stories like Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei's near-moe style and Oyasumi Punpun's stark realism. All the while the textures, lighting, and color come together well to make everything feel significant.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't unfamiliar for a contemporary anime series. The focus is college clubs, but it does something so new with it that I'd hesitate even likening it to Genshiken or Haruhi Suzumiya (though the latter's Endless Eight bears some superficial resemblance). Watching each episode is kind of like watching the previous episode with its recurring plot events, characters, and symbols, but of course the protagonist (and by extension everyone else) is in a different position. Yet it never grows stale. Instead of growing bored with the repetition of one story over a handful of episodes, I was delighted to learn more about each character's dark quirks.\\n\\n\r\nIt's strange and confusing, and the 4.5 tatami room or castella or superhero doll become monolithic (think 2001) enigmas. Binge watch and re-watch, there's new connections to be made everywhere. You'll find yourself hating the protagonist, loving him, relating to him.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing worth noting is the music is fantastic, from the OP to the score to the ED. Everything was crafted to give this show a certain ambiance and it succeeds.",

            "content": "How our lives turn out is largely up to the choices we make every day: Who we talk to, where we go, what we do and when we do it. Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (I'll be referring to it as Tatami Galaxy from now on) is about the choices made by the nameless protagonist, and the consequences that emerge from them.\r\nGoing off of the premise alone, you might by inclined to think that Tatami Galaxy is another one of those anime romcoms we all know and love, with a few bizarre twists. And while you certainly could describe the show in that way, I think thathardly gives it enough credit.\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction comes to mind as something atypical of this type of show. It's strange and almost surreal in how it displays relatively standard environments and I must say it makes the streets of Kyoto beautiful to look at. Combine this with quality animation, creative camera angles and all sorts of intriguing effects and Tatami Galaxy is certainly a show that will keep your eyes glued to the screen, although another reason for that is certainly to keep up with the rapid subtitles, unless of course you speak Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nAs I just alluded to, Tatami Galaxy's narrative and dialogue is often very fast paced, and until I had adjusted to it I found myself having to rewind a few scenes to process what I was watching, although that's less a fault of Tatami Galaxy itself and more a limitation of subtitling a show such as this. The speed at which the show progresses both the story and comedy certainly works in its favour, however. Though a few episodes may feel as though they drag a little (7 and 8 spring to mind for me), the vast majority of the scenes never overstay their welcome, and each joke is given just the right amount of timing. I was regularly laughing out loud during most episodes, which doesn't happen often.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is relatively simple. The nameless main character constantly regrets the choices he makes in his life, and time seemingly keeps turning itself back to give him another chance. Throughout Tatami Galaxy's 11 episodes a wide variety of his options are explored. The scenarios themselves are quite simple, but it's the characters who really raise the show up. I grew to love the entire cast and even those who at first seem to be minor characters will make several appearances and get plenty of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tatami Galaxy is a fantastic show that I recommend wholeheartedly. The unique directing of Masaaki Yuasa brought this engaging story and group of hilarious characters to life. It has comedy in spades, yet also manages to tell several great little stories across its runtime. Depending on where you are in life, it will either make you nostalgic for the choices you made, or excited for those you are yet to make. Wherever you are, I strongly suggest that one of your next choices is to give this show a watch. You won't regret it.",

I'm one of those elitist pricks, praising this show in all its glory. \r\nThis anime's message is not something groundbreaking, I'm sure sometime we have seen it regurgitated in someway or another. And even if it may not be the piece that packs the strongest punch with it, it still is able to deliver it nicely packed, with a quick witted delivery and characters that will grow on you as the series examines every inch of their lives.\r\nI will say, I am in the MCs position. Second year at uni, nothing to show for it and wishingfor this supposedly wonderful life that is guaranteed to be gifted here. Not actually doing anything to make it what I wish for or being happy with what I actually managed to get going for me. Not fully taking advantage of my opportunities, wasting my life on petty regrets and dumb delusions. So, yeah, I could relate incredibly well with what I was seeing and I'm sure that contributed to the degree of enjoyment I was able to get out of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you can't really get behind these concepts, there is plenty more to be offered here. The animation style is incredibly refreshing, each shot (even if a tenth of a second shown) full of life and bursting with originality. Characters that can appear tedious and one note at first quickly begin to show different sides. I came out very fond of them, a wonderful cast filled to the brim with quirks",

            "content": "I have to admit, I'm a critical snobbish bastard. When I dislike an anime I'm incapable to suppress the urge to tell everyone how bad it was, especially the people who liked the show. But now and then I come across an anime that ignites a little spark in my cold critical heart, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei is one of these particular shows. This anime did not only entertain me, but it also made me think about my own life. Oh and it has stunning, somewhat weird animation that supported the atmosphere of the show. This anime is not perfect but it is oh so damnclose.\\n\\n\r\n~story~ 9/10\\n\r\nThe main character of this anime has no name, let's just call him Watashi (what means I) like the anime does. At the start of the year, our main character has to decide which school club he's going to join, that decision can't be life changing... right guys? Right?\\n\r\nIn the first episode we see how Watashi ruins his life, he was striving for a \"rose-colored campus life\" and \"raven-haired maidens\" (how do you even come up with that?) but instead he has to face reality. And reality sucks, that's something we have all discovered on one or another occasion in our lives. Instead of being surrounded by his beautiful raven-haired girls, Watashi fails at tennis (the school club he decided to join) and he is neglected by everybody. Did I say everybody? No, not everybody, in every episode there are at least 2 persons who notice our failure of a main character: a guy who looks like a monster, Ozu and a pretty (though lacking raven-colored hair) girl, Akashi. Ozu ruins the life of our protagonist in the first episode and he keeps doing that, because every episode is a scenario where Watashi had decided to join a different school club. So back to my question, can the school club you join change your life? Yes, it can, just watch The Tatami Galaxy. Every episode is a different story of Watashi's life and every time he is chasing stupid things like his \"rose-colored campus life\" and he fails miserably every time. I seriously mean EVERY TIME. In most cases because of Ozu, or that is what our main character believes. But reality is different, something you discover in the last episode, one of the best anime endings ever made! The last episode shed a new light on the other 10 episodes and turned everything upside down, but of course I'm not going to spoil everything, this review is spoiler free.\\n\\n\r\nSomething else that is remarkable in this anime are the dialogues and the monologues, they're so fast-paced, now and then you have to pause the episode to read the monologues. This is kind of annoying but I liked it most of the time. And this anime also has comedy, pretty dark comedy and it's really funny at times. But most important, this show is not just funny, it has a deeper meaning. After watching the last episode, you realize that the main character approached his life the wrong way, and did Ozu really ruin his life? Was his life actually ruined at all? Especially if you're a student yourself, you can't escape thinking: \"Am I not doing the same things and making the same mistakes?\" I did at least (even though I am not chasing \"raven-haired maidens\" and hopefully I never will). Still, even though there is a deeper layer and a meaning behind this story, it is never preachy or boring to watch.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nWow, the story is unique, has a deeper meaning, made me think about my own life and was just extremely enjoyable to watch. Also, the dialogue is awesome, it's funny and extremely fast. The story repeats itself 11 times but it's never really boring. That's an amazing achievement! Really, the story is great, the only problem is the dialogue, sometimes it's just too fast. It annoyed me that I had to stop the anime to read the subs. But this is just a small problem compared to the awesome story. \\n\\n\r\n~art~ 10/10\\n\r\nOne word: MadHouse. Of course the art is great and it's just as unique as the story (in a positive way). It's surreal, colorful and I've never seen this art style before. It adds to the weird atmosphere of this show. In the last episode they mixed the animation with life action a few times, the result was crazy and to be honest really refreshing and cool. The animation is art but it's (thank the god of anime) not pretentious or plain stupid, this happens way too often when animators try to make something original.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nAwesome, just awesome, I really have nothing else to say. \\n\\n\r\n~music~ 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening \"Maigo Inu to Ame no Beat\" (I'm NOT going to repeat that) is great and it fits the show, the ending is less upbeat than the opening and pretty good. For the OST's (you will not hear them that much, thanks to Watashi's monologuing) they are not really special but they match with the scenes they are played in. And the voice acting is great, this is really important because if the amount of monologues and dialogues. \\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nReally good, the opening and ending are fitting and the OST's are more then decent (if you get the opportunity to hear them in between the monologues)\\n\\n\r\n~characters~ 10/10\\n\r\nWatashi is an immature lazy brad and refuses to take responsibility for his own failures. He just blames Ozu all the time, while in some situations Ozu indeed destroyed Wathashi's life (that already wasn't that great) but in most cases it wasn't Ozu but his own behavior that ruined his \"rose-colored campus life\". Ozu himself is pretty much described as the devil himself, but he is our main characters only friend. Akashi is Watashi's love interest, she is a cold girl who just does not care if people like or dislike her. And there is Jougasaki, at first a random one dimensional creep with an obsession with boobs and his doll, but every episode he turns a little bit more likable and I ended up liking him and his relationship with his doll (At least it's still a better love story than Twilight, but pretty much everything is). We also have Hanuki, whose engrish is hilarious and kind of cringeworthy and master Hinuki who wants to travel the world. And last but certainly not least..... Johnny, the weirdest character I've seen in a long time, though character? I'm not sure if can call him a character, but he's is hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about the characters is that they seem so one dimensional in the first episodes but when the story progresses this really changes. Every character has different flaws, qualities and their own quirks. They are memorable and really unique, just like the anime itself.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nGreat characterization, every character turns from a one dimensional archetype into something way more interesting. They are all imperfect in their own unique ways, just like every human has his/her own imperfections that make him/her so special. They're are well-written and relatable. And of course there is the old fortune teller and Johnny, how can anyone in this world dislike Johnny?\\n\\n\r\n~enjoyment~ 8/10\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is the weakest part of this anime, and it's still very enjoyable. This anime is funny but it's not only pure fun, the story has an important message: \"Stop chasing rose-colored campus lives, raiven-haired girls and other stupid things you will never achieve, but live and appreciate your friends even though they aren't perfect, your friends, you and your life is imperfect, but still great. Enjoy life!\" And I believe this is an important message, oh and the story is just awesome.\\n\r\nThere are two small things that lower the enjoyment score: the speed of the dialogue and the fact that the story can be a bit repetitive.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nJust watch this show, it's fun, art and a masterpiece. It has some small flaws but aside from these things everything is really great, so stop doing whatever you're doing and watch this anime! It is definitely worth your time. Peace.",

            "content": "Story: 6/10\r\n \tA third year college student reflects on his college life, and in a groundhog esque style relives his first two years of college joining all sorts of different clubs in order to achieve the rose-colored campus life he\u2019s dreamed of. Know I normally love the sort of time travel plots where characters go back in time, or in order to change their previous actions, but I feel like the Tatami Galaxy doesn\u2019t use the idea to its fullest potential. I originally liked how what the fortune teller told the MC was really similar in each timeline, but she just raises the price ofher fortune, but it is really annoying the MC never actually acts upon the realization that the rose-colored campus life was pretty much always in front of him, and that he was the main object standing in the way of his own happiness. that Most episodes follow a set beginning and end, and the repetitive nature of each episode doesn't have a different enough outcome to wear I feel like the type of backtracking used in the show was satisfying or ultimately enjoyable, and that\u2019s not all due to the stagnant structuring of the plot, but also to how much I dislike the main character Watashi and his \u201cfriend\u201d Ozu. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:5/10\\n\\n\r\n \tWatashi-\\n\\n\r\n \tA third year student, who joins pretty much any club and ends up being the social outcast stuck with the fiendish looking Ozu. He\u2019s pretty self absorbed, way too prideful, and indecisive. There is just very little likeable about him imo, and he isn\u2019t the type of outcast where you really empathise with him and his situation, because of his character. He is never grateful of anything he had until the final episode where he does a 180. I just can\u2019t justify how much of an awful character he was for a majority of the show with this sudden change of heart. The one positive thing can say about Watashi however is that he is interesting, and very methodical with his actions though this could be due to his flaws as a character.\\n\\n\r\n \tOzu-\\n\\n\r\n \tWatashi \u201cfriend\u201d, a devilish looking student that seems to love to raise havoc among the rest of the student body, resulting in detrimental consequences for himself as well as Watashi. Whatever club Watashi ends up joining Ozu also ends up in, but dues to his wormy and conniving ways he's able to climb to the top of most clubs/ after school activities he joins. He can be a good friend to Watashi by raising his spirits every once in awhile but I just do like watching this character either especially how inhuman and also demonic his appearances in Watashi life can seem at times, like he;s mocking his ultimate goal.\\n\\n\r\nArt/ Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n \tThe show looks amazing, and artsy as hell there is no denying that, though I wish that the show had a dub so that I could appreciate the artstyle and animation in all their majesty, instead of having to read texts upon texts of inner monologue at break neck speeds. The art style changes often, with some character designs like colorful silhouettes to a newspaper comic type of style. The backgrounds often looks fantastic, and visually pleasing while at times, almost realistic especially when they incorporate real life images. The openings using the 3D models and camera looks pretty neat though it gets a little tired over time. and the roaring character images feels like it's there just to fill the screen, and not to impress the audience. Still I have to give this series are really high score since I love, how it looks, and how much work it must have been to utilize the variety of different styles and color schemes seen throughout.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n\tBoth the opening and ending songs are average or slightly above average, I don\u2019t even feel slightly compelled to buy either on itunes to add to my anime music playlist, which isn't a good sign. I don\u2019t normally complain about having to watch in sub, but the characters talk so damn fast that it feels like I\u2019m studying half the time when I watch the show. I just hate how this detracts from my favorite aspect of this show (the art/ animation), because I half to keep my eyes locked to the bottom of the screen for the entirety of every episode. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n \tI went into The Tatami Galaxy, wanting to love it possibly thinking that it would be my next favorite series, due to how close Ping Pong the Animation came to being on it, but Tatami Galaxy is a completely different beast. The plot\u2019s idea had me hooked from the beginning, I just didn't like the execution of it. The characters kinda suck except Akashi who is okay, but I feel like she wasn\u2019t in the show long enough to justify devoting a whole paragraph just for her. The artstyle is top notch, and the sound is just average. This show just isn\u2019t for me, but there are still reasons to check it out, and that even if I didn\u2019t love it other still might ( and there are a lot that definitely do).",

            "content": "The Tatami Galaxy, one of the best shows I had the pleasure of watching. It tackles on themes of existentialism as we witness the tale of the unknown main character referred as \u201cWatashi\u201d striving for that rose-colored campus life. His often indecisiveness in settling matters which lead to seemingly catastrophic outcomes is an interesting aspect. Watashi is often met with regret and unsatisfaction as he tries to live out his campus life, especially that he has a mischievous best friend known as Ozu whom he blames all his misery to. This is the underlying basis of the show always resetting at the end of eachepisode and start anew on the next one. It\u2019s amusing to see that no matter how much he changes his choices, unavoidable disaster always ensues. Another interesting aspect of the show that it strives for continuity despite its multi-universe setting, thus there is almost no inconsistencies. The narrative might be hard to follow at first, from Watashi\u2019s speed-of-light talking to the constant reoccurrence of events that displays the complexity of the storyline, but you\u2019ll get accustomed to it as you progress deeper into the story. \\n\\n\r\n\tAside from Watashi and Ozu, the rest of the cast consists of eccentric yet well-characterized characters. Akashi is seemingly cold and distant who serves as Watashi\u2019s love interest. Jougasaki is energetic and perverse who is leader of the Film Circle. Higuchi is carefree yet wise, others look up to him as a Master. Hanuki is confident yet goes out of control when intoxicated with alcohol. Other characters include the love doll Keiko, the mysterious fortune teller lady, and the manifestation of the MC\u2019s libido Johnny. All of them have a vital role in the story.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow, why do I consider this show as a masterpiece? I didn\u2019t really consider it one when I started watching it until I reached the last 2 episodes. I won\u2019t spoil any specifics but the last 2 episodes are the culmination of everything that the show presented thus far. This is where Watashi underwent a self-reflecting evaluation of how he led his life so far and reach an ultimate realization. The seemingly confusing storytelling will make sense at this point, and the conclusion starts to unfold. \\n\\n\r\nThe main focus of this show is about making choices. Are you satisfied with the life choices you\u2019ve made? If you can turn back time, will you make better choices? Do you believe that an ideal life exists? Is it possible to attain such a life? These are questions that the show poses to the audience and tries to answer them.  The message it tries to convey and how it has presented it in duration of 11 episodes is enough of a reason for the show to be a masterpiece. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, or The Tatami Galaxy serves as an allegory for the fact that it is nigh impossible to achieve a perfect, ideal life and that you should rather take hold of the opportunities you currently. Animated by MADHOUSE, the light novel adaptation encapsulates the essence of source material quite well - the story remains undoubtedly one of the best anime has to offer and it's art is no joke either. You'll find yourself pausing numerous times to look up the definitions of words or read text that flies by because of the protagonist's fast inner monologues. The series begins on a very, veryconfusing point that had me re-watching the first episode multiple times to see if all that was said was relevant to the overall plot in any way.\\n\\n\r\nThe bulk of the story follows one common episodic format, wherein the protagonist follows through an attempt to achieve an ideal campus life by joining various clubs and activities, but this never works out. At the end of each episode, these experiences are nullified, and the protagonist heads back to a point he was at previously for another attempt (unbeknownst to him). The story seems to be inconsistent, bizarre, but above all - it seems to have no connection to the story. For the majority of the series, you can't really tell what direction the story is headed in, but in the final episodes, all of these piece together in the most exceptional way possible. It delivers the most satisfying and conclusive ending of almost every series I have seen or read. The entire build up of the story is literally an \"OH SHIT\" moment.\\n\\n\r\nI had a somewhat similar experience with the art - at first, it seemed... sub-par. It looked cheaply animated and often utilized real life footage - I was shocked when I learned that this series was animated by MADHOUSE of all studios - but it was later on in the series when I truly began to appreciate how expressive it was - the animation was incredibly distinct and was something that had never been attempted previously. It greatly affected my enjoyment and I wouldn't have been as satisfied without it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design was splendid, to say the least - the opening was fairly lacking in my opinion, though many will disagree with me. The opening was a cliche J-pop track by Asian Kung Fu Generation - on it's own, it stands fairly decently, but it does nothing to help the show. It feels lacking as it doesn't take the risky approach that the visual design and ending theme took, wherein the ending theme happened to be an extremely unique track that fit perfectly with the visuals added to it - to put simply, it was extremely reminiscent of the Space Dandy ending. The OST created for the show is entirely orchestral and very mellow - it fits well with the aspects of the series that seem to orient closer to the slice of life aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are few in numbers but most are fully fleshed out, memorable, and feel very realistic, much like the rest of the show's grounded nature. The ambitions and emotions of the characters become very clear as the running time of the show goes by - both the light novel and anime adaptation do well to bring life to the characters of this fictional world. This makes for a very enjoyable and relatable experience.\\n\\n\r\nI rate the show 4.5/4.5 Tatamis.",

            "content": "Tatami Galaxy offers a rather unique premise for an anime in that our nameless male lead is trapped in a time loop as he experiences differing scenarios for his ideal university life, unaware that there is another path for him to take which won't lead to his ideal perceptions crashing down upon him and entrapping himself in the neverending time loop. The series mixes around comedy and some rather elaborate storytelling in the exploration of our nameless lead's struggles as each of the differing time loops lead us to know more of the other characters that our lead interacts with at points and make himrealize that many of the people of his so-called ideal scenario are not as they seem on the surface. The time loops also introduce our lead and the audience to a few characters who are not what they would seem on the surface according to the narration provided by the male lead. Many of these moments serve to be comical as a number of the character revelations are over the top, but others serve as an existential reflection by our male lead over what his true path in life would be with his college life. While a unique premise for a title, it won't be for everyone thanks to its time loop premise repeating events with our male lead (which led me to originally ditch this series years ago) and a good amount of the series being rather dialogue-heavy, enough so where the dialogue can make it difficult at points to keep up with English subtitle translations used for official and fansub releases of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe visual presentation of the series is a bit avant-garde. Character designs are a bit on the simple side in terms of details with some character designs seeming to be a homage to older animation styles (notably with Ozu and Higuchi), but scenery and symbolic shots involve a mixture of abstract drawings, surreal use of color shading and rotoscoped animation. Despite what my Art rating would reflect of these visual choices, the choice of animation style helps to allow Tatami Galaxy to stick out more prominently compared to conventional animation styles employed for anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhile a bit of an acquired taste, Tatami Galaxy still offers a unique approach to a time loop scenario in anime by turning it into an existential comedy with its focus on our male lead coming to grips with the so-called \"rose-colored campus side\" he comes to desire out of his university life. The series is a definite look if you are looking for anything out of the ordinary for an anime title.",

            "content": "Congrats for finding this gem buried beneath so many rocks and other bull crap.\r\nI remember starting this anime once, only to drop it after the first episode. Ozu's face was bit to get used to and the whole stylistic narration as well. Some anime you have to pay some attention to or you lose out. It's like, some books you can just read the dialogue and skip all the boring description bits, but in some other books, the dialogue doesn't make sense if you don't read the description along with it. That's probably why I'd dropped it before. But am I glad I picked itback up and started from the beginning. This time, I watched all eleven eps in one go and was left with a big smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nTatami Galaxy = the answer to the question: \"What if ...?\"\\n\\n\r\n=there's no point in answering that because you'll never be satisfied anyway. Whether that alternate possibility had occured or not. You'd still be lamenting and asking \"What if...?\". It's like the futility of jealousy, even if you have what that other person has, you still wouldn't be satisfied and would seek what you initially had. In Tatami Galaxy's case, you'd have completely forgotten that you once had that. Ah, the dramatic irony in this anime is superb.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, it's the kind of anime you can't really take your eyes off, even if just to catch all the subtitles because Mr Protagonist talks so fast (it adds to the narration's charm though). He's never given a name - he's really a universal type of character that stands for each of us in the audience. The different choices he makes turns him into the different people and it really makes you wonder about yourself and what kind of person you would be if you had taken a different choice somewhere down the road of life.\\n\\n\r\nIt also gives you the idea that maybe meeting some people in your life is inevitable. For example, Mr Protagonist's one and only friend, Ozu and the black thread of fate that links them together. And the castella, can't forget the castella.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen some people call this a mindfuck anime, but i really couldn't disagree more. It's just smart and well planned out and loaded with symbolism. It is a bit confusing and somewhat surreal, almost, at first, but everything's rounded off really well at the end and really you don't need to understand the point of the anime to enjoy it (you'll get it at the end anyway, so don't worry about that until the last few episodes, just enjoy the ride). Each episode is hilarious and fun in its own way. The message at the end is heartwarming too :D. Ah, I wanted to give them all a hug at the end.\\n\\n\r\nYou can call it deep if you want, but at the same time it's not. It's just awesome storytelling that gets its message across very well. Like, you have some stories which happen to teach you life lessons along the way, but you have this, where from the first instance, the story builds up to convey one main end message.",

            "content": "Back to Studio Madhouse, the studio that makes anything and everything. The person given the task to direct an extremely unique anime in The Tatami Galaxy was the skilled verteran Masaaki Yuasa (Kaiba). Tatami Galaxy\u2019s is a novel by Tomihiko Morimi whose works are quite popular to an older audience such as college student. This anime adaptation is probably more suited towards older fans and fans wanting something very different in their anime.\r\nThe objective in Tatami Galaxy is about a young man named Watashi whom has finally reached college life. He dreams of the perfect campus life such as chasing women and having his youthbe worth it through various experiences. However, after he submits to the whims of a guy named Ozu and the community hating him immensely, Watashi wonders what his college life could have been like if he followed a different path starting with changing what club he joined.\\n\\n\r\nInto 2010, anime as a whole started feeling stale and mediocre with a plethora of cute girls doing cute things and genre tropes taking over instead of new ideas. Seeing something like Tatami Galaxy is a breath of fresh air. Immediately the viewer is forcefully engaged with the fastest verbiage a human can muster. This does not stop as long as inner character monologue exists and there is a plethora of it. Director Yuasa does a decent enough job focusing on how diverse this show is from a God eating at a ramen stand to any number of random oddities and silly occurrences throughout the show. Our main character Watashi constantly blunders from episode to episode with what-if moments in his college life constantly getting put into the most dramatic situations imaginable with a high emphasis on imagination. Much of the comedy focus here is on observation rather than the usual slap-stick and cultural references. For example, this comedy is about how much one can ridicule and laugh at one\u2019s self.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation and characters are both unique and odd in the most extreme way possible. The best example of this format was seen previously in Haruhi Suzumiya with the \u201cendless eight\u201d episodes. Meaning, different episode different perspectives and different circumstances, but in Tatami Galaxy this is the entire show. There is not much depth at all in what it is attempting to do. What is meant here is by showing a different perspective, a certain amount of change is needed to accomplish this goal. Both the narrative and perspective still remain the same with extremely fast dialogue always rendering back to Watashi\u2019s original problem in himself and the same problematic comedic issues beaten to death with a bat. For example, Ozu always creating a problem out of nonsense because he can, Watashi falling into the same issue of inevitability, and much of the same repeated sexual frustrations. At least the colour pallets and art style is among the best seen in \u201cmodern\u201d anime.\\n\\n\r\nYes, Tatami Galaxy is incredibly unique. Yes, the storytelling style is refreshing. Yes, the show explores a multiple-path without overlap. However, this never seems to accomplish the deep narrative it is clearly going for. All of the show\u2019s effort went into strictly being unique and nothing more. If a character is within his own imagination, why does Watashi continually build towards an end he already knows? Choices of characters in the show are shown as making emotionally sound choices, but are always failing due to their one-dimensional character models they are based on. \\n\\n\r\nSure, many viewers could look at all of these \u201cflaws\u201d as stated, and instead turn it upside down and see Tatami Galaxy as one of the most creative anime of all time. This direction could easily be seen from the complete opposite perspective as a serious concept and see the end as a pure glorious interpretation of reaching another form and discovering one\u2019s self. This is a show that is ultimately left up for how one interprets the journey leading to one simple conclusion. Did you enjoy it?",

The unique way it shows the different possibilities and timelines our protagonist lives through is interesting and is even more enhanced by the last two episodes. Not only is it thought provoking, but it has many respectable morals and philosophies interwoven into the show's dialogue that some may miss if they don't look into it, which is something I enjoyed a great deal.\r\n[ART: 10/10]\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy has a very unique art style to it that sets it apart from its contemporaries. It's refreshingto see something that isn't generic and trying to fit in with the crowd nowadays. The distinct character designs are very well done and help to portray the characters even without knowing their personalities beforehand.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 10/10]\\n\r\nThe voice actors fit the characters perfectly and the soundtrack is phenomenal. Not much to complain about here.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 9/10]\\n\r\nWhile some characters aren't meant to be more than pieces that move the story forward, those who are meant to play an important role are very well done, especially the main character. This show's format doesn't lend to much possibility of character development, so I won't rate it too harshly regarding that.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 10/10]\\n\r\nI'm sure most people will either love this show or not understand all of the hype that it has garnered, but personally I can say this was an beautifully unique experience that I enjoyed immensely, whether it be its art style, storytelling aspect, or just great characters.",

            "content": "I have yet to experience my college life, heck when I do I'm gonna be studying more than kids in Africa learning how to shoot assault rifles.  I dream though, that in college I will become a sexy black man that all the ladies would want to flock towards like Sarah Palin to a vibrator.  Those are but dreams and high ambitions though.  To my surprise I could end up like a hopeless romantic, making choices along the way that  would get me nowhere.  But what if I told you it's not about the choices, it's about how you handlethe choices and that the opportunity for your objective has always been right in front of your very eyes.  Well that's something the protagonist from The Tatami Galaxy learns about.  Today I am reviewing the anime elitists stroke their hot rod for, The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is an anime produced by studio Madhouse, which as I said in the past can be on and off with their productions, Yes I'm looking at you Magical Warfare! It is a mystery, romance, psychological anime.\\n\r\nThe series has 11 episodes which aired from April 2010 to July 2010 and is directed by Yuasa, Masaaki who also handled the script, and storyboard.  He is known for his works Kaiba Which I am currently watching and Ping Pong the Animation which was a breath of fresh air after seeing the train wreck that was Black Bullet in the Spring.  So is Tatami Galaxy any good?  Let's find out!\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY\\n\r\nWithout spoiling a lot, the story of The Tatami Galaxy follows our main protagonist referred to as Watashi who we see eating at a ramen stand when all of a sudden he encounters a self-proclaimed deity of matrimony.  Through this encounter we watch our protagonist as he flashes back and remembers his dramatic and most importantly, sexless college years.  We get to see on multiple occasions the time he wastes whenever he joins a club, or as called in this anime a circle.  Throughout these various clubs we see him try out and ultimately fail at, he encounters a scheming student named Ozu who seems to hold influence over Watashi and transforms him from a hopeless romantic to a black cupid of sorts.  Watashi also ponders on his level of care for Akashi who a second year engineering female student that we see him constantly making promises with and are seen to hold a \\n\r\nspecial bond that is often rattled when Watashi makes a choice that goes against her or completely disregards her.  So this is simply the story of a how a hopeless romantic in college tries to fit in, and tries to find love in a hopeless place, when all he needs to do is see the opportunity in front of him.  Events happen in each episode, time resets and we see Watashi in a different club than in the previous episode.  With some hazards along the way and people misdirecting our protagonist like Ozu, this is the story on how the slightest of decisions can manifest a series of events that can change your life.\\n\\n\r\nNow the story may seem like another slice of life, but trust me, it's far from it.  It's about as far away from being a generic slice of life as a black kid away from his runaway biological father.  The show is not afraid to take simple ideas and completely morph them into something new.  I honestly can not compare this show to any other show I have ever seen in my life.  The show is highly original giving off the vibe that a lot of hard work and effort was put into the story to make it work carefully and steadily like making a cake just right so that an angry bridezilla won't cut you up with her dagger.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime brings on some pretty heavy themes and displayed some of the harsh but very true aspects of life.  Themes from depression to being sex deprived like a Japanese Weeaboo without his tentacle hentai are all a part of what makes Tatami Galaxy an immersive experience that pulls the audience in with it's dark themes.  This is surprising because most of the time, people aren't pulled into anime with dark themes, instead they want to be pulled into a world that can allow themselves to escape from real life.  \\n\r\nHowever, as I just mentioned, the Tatami Galaxy, though being the opposite of using unrealistic themes to immerse an audience, manages to suck people up and honestly I felt like I was immersed more than an IGN reviewer being immersed in a COD Game.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime brings on crazy events from left field that will make the most sane of minds go insane trying to figure out what the hell is going on onscreen.  This is thanks to some beautiful symbolism which keeps the audience thinking of what special meaning a certain part of the story has.  This is thanks to the amazing script writing and as I'll discuss later, the art!\\n\\n\r\nThe series is highly episodic but that never hurts the series in any way, sure there is at least 1 episode that doesn't really further the plot in any way but other than that each episode has a series of convoluted events that in the end wraps up together so that everything that has happened in the anime matters and that no minutes were wasted on pointless crap in this anime.  I can't say the same thing for Zankyou no Terror, which in my opinion had some insanely pointless episodes and not to mention characters *SHOTS FIRED* but all and all the series of events portrayed in this anime are all really interesting and should keep you glued to your chair.  More glued than Ryuuji's semen on Taiga's fa-err been reading too many doujinshis\\n\\n\r\nI talked about choice many times in the synopsis and how it plays a big role in this story, well without spoiling much let's just say that at the end of every episode the clock rewinds and we find ourselves at square one again only to find out our main protagonist has made a different decision than the previous one.  This could throw some viewers off like Melissa McCarthy upside down off a Roller Coaster but once you realize what's going on it all becomes clear and in the end you'll seem more idiotic than the person who \\n\r\nreviewed Pokemon Alpha Sapphire.  TOO MUCH WATER, THE FUCKKK! But the choices makes the series all the more special, and the way they are handled makes the experience even more rich and engaging.\\n\\n\r\nHow did it present its genres you ask?  Well then, as a mystery it always kept me wondering why the sequence of events are happening and what are the motives behind each of the characters and how they act.  So as a mystery it does better than Freddy the Fish so thank god.  As a lover of puzzles, this anime is a dream come true, always having me thinking, and thinking about how the events all tie together, and that's what makes the Tatami Galaxy a great interactive mystery show!  As a romance, it may not seem like it at first but the hints of romance here and there and well everywhere adds flavor to Tatami Galaxy.  Our main protagonist is constantly reminded that the opportunity for romance is right in front of him, but instead becomes a hopeless romantic that is dying to be loved.  Romance fuels mostly all of the characters motivations which makes it such an important theme int he story.  Last but not least, the psychological element of the show was nothing short of immersive and breathtaking.  We take a great look into seeing what the heck is going on inside of the protagonist's mind and how his thoughts and actions manifest inside his head to ultimately make his decisions.  This is further amplified later in the show when I talk about the art/animation.  My favorite episodes were the ones where we got to explore the psychological \\n\r\nnature of the show as well as the romantic themes of the show as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I had with this show is the pacing, not the pacing of the show but the pacing of the dialogue.  The dialogue moves faster than production of Loli Body Pillows, do I want said pillow? No, I'm not Elmo okay?  Honestly at first it was the biggest turnoff for me, but if you can keep up with the inner monologues then you're all set.  I managed to be able to keep up with the pace, but slow readers be aware that if you watch this you might miss the full experience.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso, a small little gripe I had was the ending.  The ending was a solid ending but I can't help to feel like there was missing something.  I felt that in some ways it was abrupt and that there should have been more but all and all they pulled off a good ending!\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nLets start off with Watashi, our main protagonist who is the hopeless romantic.  Over the course of the series we get to learn more about him and the dilemmas always gets in.  His viewpoints on life are indeed both hilarious and to some extent actually true on the reality of life.  Throughout the story, he gets fully fleshed out as we see different angles of who he truly is based off of the circles he joins in each episode.  As time rewinds and he joins a new club we get to see more of his personality and who he truly is.  What's great about him is that he's not the best with women unlike every harem protagonist out there, nor is the stereotypical small steroid balled Arnold Schwarzennegar type of guy.  Watashi is not any not any of those, he's his own character and doesn't stick to an archetype.  This allows for a more realistic type of personality for Watashi which in turn makes him \\n\r\nmore relatable and not just a cut and paste slap on character.  Though easily manipulated Watashi as a main character is both interesting and fun to watch, which makes him the rose of the everlasting spectacle garden of flowers that is The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\nOzu can be percieved as the main \"anatagonist\" of this story.  Sure he looks uglier a Samuel Jackson Rebel Wilson baby crack baby, but that doesnt mean that his character is actually bad.  He has hidden motives throughout the story that we as the audience figure out bit by bit, piece by piece, tit by tit along the way.  He like to cause unhappiness among people, like a clown with anal beads showing little kids at a party how to make them disappear.  Anyways he is a very intriguing character, though dark on the outside he has some hidden stuff going on on the inside that may make him seem brighter than a stripper's glow in the dark tassles. Him and Watashi both get the most screen time and are both characters that are extremely 3 dimensional and for that I have to give props.\\n\\n\r\nAkashi is more cold than the ice cream on Pico's nipples but don't let that fool you!  She is cold to mostly everyone but Watashi making her character highly interesting.  I wish she had more screentime because I felt that she wasnt as fleshed out as she should have. But what is indeed great about her though is that we get to see both sides of the same coin with her cold side for everyone but Watashi, and her more outgoing side whenever she talks with Watashi.  As the love interest of this story she does things anime girls \\n\r\nnowadays dont do, that is, being as annoying as Obama Care and hornier than your elementary school librarian.  She's afraid of moths, and I don't blame her, they're more terrifying than Kriten Stewart's honey pot, but it's the tiny quirks like this that allow her character to be fun whenever on screen.  \\n\\n\r\nOther characters include\\n\\n\r\nThe self proclaimed deity, Seitarou Higuchi\\n\r\nThe doll lover Masaki Jougasaki who is a part of the cinema circle\\n\r\nAnd one of my personal favorites Johnny, who is a cowboy that is supposed to represent Watashi's hormones.  Seriously, whoever thought of Johnny has to be a genius\\n\r\nAll and all, the cast is full of interesting and intriguing characters that are fun and enjoyable to watch.  The mystery behind the characters allows you to focus on the screen for the whole 20 minutes without taking bathroom breaks, or clicking on pornhub pop ups.  Though the only flaws are that some of the side characters aren't as fleshed out as people would like them to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\r\nNow lets get into the art and animation.  Some might dismiss this art as being childish and uninspired showing a lack of effort.  Well, to those people I have to say look again because there is much more to it!  The elements of design and composition all appear here is masterful ways.  Colors contrast, they unify, they have rhythm and can repeat.  The whole show almost appears to dance from style to style in a snap and that is the beauty and nature of the show.  The abstractness of the art also allows for some stellar\\n\r\npsychedelic imagery that is not only exciting to look at but also it also livens up the world of Tatami Galaxy. For you see, the world is not made to be pretty all the time and that is what this art shows perfectly.  They also use actual real life background images too in some places which is weird yet shows off how innovative the art truly is. The character designs are simple yet they perfectly blend in perfectly with the versatile art style.  Although I understand the style they chose for this show I just wish things would be more detailed during the scenes where nothing psychological or major is happening but that's the biggest issue with the art a lack of background detail.  Other than that it's amazing.  Thankfully the animation of the show is highly fluent with the rarest of rare occasions being choppy to the point where you'd have to have eyes like a hawk.  The character movements feel genuine and the special effects of the show are beautifully presented.  From\\n\r\nfireworks exploding to great directed psychological scenes, this anime utilizes every aspect of it's art style and uses it to its advantage.  Honestly, the art and animation of this show though abstract and out of the norm offers up some jaw dropping visuals and has to be one of my personal favorite art styles I've seen in any anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND\\n\r\nThe sound of the Tatami Galaxy is probably the weakest part for me but that's not saying much seeing how it's still very good.  The voice acting for Watashi is excellently done by Asanuma Shintaro, and might I add for a voice actor to speak faster than superman thrusting into Lois Lane, without stumbling over his words, it's a job well done. I've always wondered how much power Superman had though, would Lois Lane just like, I don't know, one thrust and she flys through the wall.  Anyways, all the voice actors fit, Ozu's voice was great and it brought more life to his schemish nature.  The ost was solid, not the most memorable in my opinion but still stands above most Osts I've seen.  The songs were utilized really well and the quality of the music fit the tone of the story.  The opening grew on me as well as the ending and I felt as if there was really no problem with the sound.  It fit the story and the characters like a XXL condom on a Terry Crews.\\n\\n\r\nSo adding all my scores together\\n\\n\r\nGiving the story a 9.3\\n\r\nThe characters a 9.4\\n\r\nThe Art/Animation a 9\\n\r\nand the sound a 8.5\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy gets a score of 8.99 out of FUCK IT, a 9/10 giving it a recommendation of better than sex.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously ladies and gentlemen, if you are now having sexual intercourse with your lover, spouse, or even best friend to get back at your other best friend, please, drop your pixie stick, sit down on your computer, cover up your cock a doodle doo, or if you are female, just put on panties and watch this show.  Literally, I love this show at the moment and it is a fantastic piece of literature with great narrative and characters that feel like they are about to pop right out of the page.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I don't know where to start.  I don't want to be too harsh about this because I've only watched two episodes, but so far I think it's entertaining.  I'll be as nice as I can in this review.\r\nStory\r\nI find the story intriguing, but I'm disappointed by its episodic nature.  It's like there's no point to what I'm watching because it'll just be irrelevant in the next episode.  I hope there's something that ties this all together and it's not just pointless.  I would've liked things to be longer.  I'm not saying Tatami should be one of those overly longanimes with lots of fillers, but it's hard to thoroughly examine 4 years in one episode.  I would've liked it to be a bit longer.  That's just me.  I like analyzing things.  I'm afraid that if it just rewinds back at the end of each episode the show will become boring, and repetitive.  And how's the character development going to play out here if we're just watching them repeat things in a different universe?  Maybe they should've showed the universes from different points of views so that you'd get to know the characters more, and to avoid repetitive things.  If each episode ends the same way, Watashi-san refuses to find love, and it's that way for the entire series, I can't say that I'll be impressed by this.  I find the concept interesting, how it's playing out so far can be better, and I'm worried about how this is going to turn out.  I may be speaking too soon so I won't take any points off for that.  \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nPersonally, I love the artwork.  It's very distinct, and appealing.  The backgrounds are done very beautifully, and the characters are drawn nicely.  As far as character design goes they are just very appealing.  Nothing amazing, but they're very nice.  And gasp!  You can actually tell some of the characters apart.  I love how they gave some of the characters very distinct features.  However, I am not fond of Watashi-san's character design.  Plus it reminded me too much of Mr.Despair's.  I also want to note the clothing because I can tell the art directors put some thought into them.  Unlike in most animes where they're just outlandish.  I liked their use of patterns, tones, textures, shades, and sometimes the usage of actual pictures/videos.  That makes the artwork edgy, and unique.  However, the animation was a mess.  The animations were choppy, and lazy more than half the time.  Sometimes the animations got ridiculously choppy, and it seemed to be more of amateur work.  Although I can tell they put lots of effort into the artwork it just doesn't make up for the terrible animation.  Not to mention they reused a lot of animations.  That just makes the show more boring.  Don't get me wrong.  The animation wasn't extremely choppy...most of the time, but it's choppy just enough for you to notice it.  It makes me wonder.  Did they not shade, used a lot of textures, and used real stuff etc for artistic purposes or because of budget money?  Maybe just pure laziness.  That just bugs me, and takes a bit away from the niceness of the artwork.  \\n\r\n6/10 \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI like the sound.  I think the soundtrack is quirky, especially the ED.  I like the OP, but it doesn't really stand out to me.  The bgm is decent, but I'm not really listening to it.  It's not noticeable, or remarkable.  I love the ED, I like the OP.  Overall, Idk it's alright.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nI think all of the characters are unique, and I really enjoy them.  Although they're very vague, and I'd like to get to know them more.  So far Watashi-san seems a bit of a blah main, but just a little bit.  I don't know how I'm going to if I just watch them repeat shit, but maybe there's some sort of twist end I'm not aware of.  I'll say it again.  I'm very very worried about character development right now because of its episodic nature.  It'll go back and time, and all that they've learned will be worth nothing in the next episode.  +points for the characters being realistic for once in an anime.\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment of the show is fairly high for me.  None of it is laugh out loud for me or anything, but it's just amusing.  The weirdness of the situation, and the oddness of the characters.  How they present it to you is great, but it could play out better.  This kind of thing is very hard to find in anime.  Like I said, I'm very worried about this getting old, and me getting bored of it a couple episodes from now.  And let's not forget Watashi-san's fast talking.  Right now it's kind of annoying to me, and I hope they stop doing it in later episodes. \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nThis anime is lots of fun, and its strange nature is amusing.  Although essential, and technical aspects take away from it.  I feel like it's just a show too focused on details rather than the big picture.  In the end there better be a point to all of this.\\n\r\n6.5-7(?)/10",

            "content": "For the sake of clarification, I will preface with something that reads more like a conclusion: Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (which I will from here on refer to as The Tatami Galaxy) is a solid and endearing romance anime - the art and comedic light-hearted tone of events makes the characters feel likeable and compelling each in their own way, and The Tatami Galaxy does certainly have a lot of what the \"enlightened\" crowd like to parade as artistic merit, in the way that it tells its story, and in the way the orchestral soundtrack coincides nicely with what is going on on screen. If youare looking for a light-hearted romance anime with a unique premise/artstyle, or are someone who can greatly enjoy \"artsy\" stuff just for being \"artsy\", The Tatami Galaxy is right up your alley. Additionally the OP and ED are very nice, and it does a nice twist with them towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nIt is true that The Tatami Galaxy is good, and it is true that it is \"different\", but in the modern world, where lots of different and unique media can easily be found by straying off the beaten path even slightly, something is not made into a masterpiece just because it's different. The matter of fact is that The Tatami Galaxy, when looked at through a cynical lens, can be very formulaic and repetitive, with some flaws that stick out like a sore thumb.\\n\\n\r\nThe first of these is funnily enough, the artstyle. Although the artstyle does indeed bring its charm to the show's presentation, and is a big part of The Tatami Galaxy's aforementioned artistic merit, it feels rather inconsistent in quality. There are times where the \"traditional art\" aesthetic brings beauty to scenes, but there are other times where it can appear amateurish, such as a loss of facial detail at medium-distance shots, where there really shouldn't be such a decline in detail. Overall the art is enticing, but largely only because it's \"different\". As someone who has watched quite a few shows with unique artstyles, the visual presentation of The Tatami Galaxy does not feel like anything special (this however does not extend to the soundtrack, which has some standout tracks. Many people will love the soundtrack, even though it was not the kinda thing that wows me personally).\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the character cast are endearing because of their exaggerated personalities and often-comical designs and animations, but the characters don't really have any traits of note aside from these personalities and animations, which results in making the cast feel a bit two-dimensional. The MC is an outcast shut in, Akashi is the cold-but-sweet love interest, Ozu is mischeivous, Higuchi is a comedic relief, Hanuki is a playful girl who likes to get drunk, Jougasaki is a pervert, and any other characters are not shown often enough to have much of note. Hell, one of the supporting characters, Aijima is not even shown until episode 9, which makes it hard to care about him in any way. Aside from the main character developing in the last two episodes as a result of spoilerific circumstances, there is almost no character development present in The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, although you could say that it comes with the \"alternate timelines\" premise, The Tatami Galaxy feels formulaic, especially in the first 5 episodes. The formula goes as such: MC joins an extracurricular club (or doesn't) at the start of college, they don't fit in, meet the weird and devious Ozu and then comedic things happen until the MC misses his opportunity to woo Akashi and feels like his two college years are wasted. Although this sounds like the kind of thing that is \"the point\" of the show, it still feels like this aspect could have been delivered a lot better, at least in the first half. In the final few episodes, we start to see events which transpired in earlier timelines from a different perspective, which is cool and allows the viewer to better appreciate what happened, but in the first half, the show resorts to recycling dialogue and scenes, which gives the impression that The Tatami Galaxy has little confidence in its audience. Characters are reintroduced and treated as though they are new each episode, which limits how much development the characters experience and perspectives from which we can see them.\\n\\n\r\nThis execution of the premise also gives the first half of The Tatami Galaxy very little stakes or reasons for the viewer to care about it, because at the end of the first episode the MC will timewarp back to the start of the formula no matter what happens. It is for these reasons that I thought the first half of The Tatami Galaxy was flat-out unenjoyable, however the second half picked things up greatly as the writing started to have confidence in the audience, and the ending was heartwarming and left things off at just the right note for a light-hearted romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The Tatami Galaxy is an artistic anime that often reaches amazing heights of quality, but is limited in its scope by a lack of willingness to flesh out the character cast beyond their two-dimensional traits for the majority of the show. It is certainly a show that was bold enough to do something unique and as a result will remain a cult classic for years to come, but only with a higher budget for more consistently-good art and more time to consider the writing could it have become truly worthy of the label \"masterpiece\".\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I decided to watch this show at a friends request I had no idea what I was in for. The only knowledge that I gathered from my compatriot was that he held the show in high regard. Upon completing this Anime I can see where his love for it comes from. \r\nStory: 9\r\nImpressive almost doesn't do it justice. The creators of this show took an ordinary idea and turned it into an extraordinary one. Most of the story is told in a very episodic fashion, which normally would be taken as each episode having generally nothing to do with the next, but it isquite the opposite. Each episode is crafted with detail and woven together in such a way to make several layers of what seems like different tales into one over arching story. The last two episodes serve too tie everything together and were the best in the entire show. If anything was weak about this show, it isn't this. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nA very interesting animation style lead to my eyes being very pleased, and the change from the norm was very welcomed. So why only a seven some might ask. Clearly from what I just said it's not like I found the style of the show jarring or unpleasant. The animation was just good, nothing really wrong with it, but nothing that stood out and screamed masterful. If anything this was the weakest part of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nNow besides the immensely wonderful opening and ending songs, nothing else in the music department really nailed it for me. It worked for the show don't get me wrong, but nothing made me pause an episode to look up the OST to download it. Where the music falters, the voice acting shines even brighter. Each character sounded fitting and the voice actors/actresses in question delivered wonderful performances. One of my favorites being the devilish voice of Ozu. I love this beautiful bastard and his voice added to this love. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Ozu, the characters of this show are beautiful. Each one brought a brilliance to each scene they were in with ease. Watashi, Ozu, Akashi, and everyone else in the cast went above and beyond on the fun meter. I honestly haven't seen an ensemble of characters that I've liked this much since \"Baccano!\", and that alone is a testament to how wonderful these people are. Now let me get down to the winner of the cast. ***Spoiler*** Ozu not only field my heart with joy and laughter every time he appeared on screen but in the end when you figure out that he was actually the best of bros the entire time was just wonderful.***End*** So as characters go, you have quite a group that will make each episode worth tuning in for. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is something that is completely subjective. Although I don't believe in giving any show a ten because something can't be truly perfect, when it comes to my enjoyment however its a different story. I couldn't have loved this show anymore. I would recommend it to anyone flat out. It is worth your time, even if you end up not enjoying it as much as I. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: The Tatami Galaxy was a show rich in characters and had a very standard story told in a very unique way. With an interesting art style and wonderful voice acting this show excels at almost everything across the board. Lowest point for the show would be in its animation, although no where near bad, I felt like it didn't quite have anything that made me go wow. This is a must watch for people who are looking for something different. If you aren't then watch it anyways. It was one hell of a fun ride, and I thank my friend for the recommendation.

            "content": "Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (The Tatami Galaxy) is a mystery psychological anime with a little spice romance in it directed by Masaaki Yuasa who also directed an anime of the year that is Devilman: Crybaby and Ping Pong The Animation. Those anime doesn't feel different from the spot of their artwork, the animation until the story that somewhat absurd but unique to watch. This anime is essentially a story that the premise looks ordinary but the narrative can be spelled out very unusual until you watch. The premise is like this, someone who is always in a situation that faced an option. This option will bringhim into a life where he will despair or get a happy ending. If he fails, the time will turn back to take a chance on one's life so that he will be in the same situation again. In essence, it's also difficult to explain how this anime walks on because there are so many ways to interpret this anime. It could be either absurd or logical. But, I assume that this is an anime I can't forget its existence anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, this anime tells about a person in a situation where he is confronted with two choices that will bring his life to a happy or bad ending. Each episode can be unique and mindblowing because I wonder if watching the first episode will be a typical romance anime. In the first episode, we will be introduced to a character that we don't know what his name's until the end, that meets someone who considers himself the god of matrimony. The narrator will then enter an organization on his campus because he hopes to be able to live a campus that full of roses and will meet a black haired girl that he always dreamed of. But that is not his expectation because he always ended up miserably. For the narrator, Ozu is a very annoying character for him because he is a character that full of misfortune who likes to take advantage and take pleasure in other people. Each scene will always be repeated that will be at a certain a point that allows us to understand. The repetitive scene is like a castella cake, a ramen shop, and most important of all is a fortune teller. At the end of the episode, the narrator will arrive at a room that is always repetitive like a limbo. In the end, it made me realize that this anime doesn't seem to have the end of the story at the end because the story is always repeated.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've ever seen Ping Pong The Animation or Devilman: Crybaby, maybe the art is just obvious to you. However, I'm not suggesting this anime to you who just want to estimate the art rather than the story. The animation, until it's art in here, is very brilliant. Plus, the animated portion that created absurd things may also improve the plot-story so that the psychological genre is frequently felt. I think this anime is worked out by Shaft studio which can be said as the studio with the unique anime like Monogatari series, Mekakucity Actors, Nisekoi, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica. Apparently, the anime is worked on by Madhouse's studio that makes popular anime like Death Note, Hunter x Hunter, One Punch Man, Highschool of the Dead, and etc. Although like that, all of the anime that made by Madhouse feels different when compared with an anime like this. But, I admit that the art and the animation are unique to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending song most I like best in this anime. For the opening, Asian Kung-Fu Generation is the band that filled its opening song entitled \"Maigo Inu to Ame no Beat.\" Asian Kung-Fu Generation can indeed always fill the opening or the ending song in an anime such as Naruto where he filled the second opening entitled \"Haruka Kanata\" or Boku dake ga Inai Machi titled \"Re: Re:\". The ending song is also very charming to hear. Juuji Ishiwatari, Yoshinori Sunahara, and Etsuko Yakushimaru are those who sang the ending song of this anime entitled \"Kamisama no Iutoori.\" But, the most makes me deliberate with this one anime is Shintaro Asanuma who fill the voice of the main character of the narrator. He is a seiyuu that I can say is very different from the others. Although he is not too flashy in other anime such as Accel World, Seitokai Yakuindomo, or Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? he is very different for this anime because he brings his character so quickly that we as the audience is also very difficult to follow the subtitle which is fairly fast because of his quick talk. For the other seiyuu, I can say it's good but Shintaro is the badass.\\n\\n\r\nWatashi is the main character in this anime. He expects a campus life that full of roses to make his campus life not be emptied again. Therefore, he wanted to enter every organization that existed on his campus. Each episode will be told that he took every organization that is very different in it. Call it like cinematography, bicycle club, English club, and others. Each of his life will always be repeated with the same story but he just enters every organization that looks different. For Watashi, he really dislikes the people around him who always forget him but Ozu is the worst of all. For Watashi, Ozu is a bully and often uses him for pleasure only. In the end, Watashi realizes the time when he's still on campus and the people around him is the most memorable thing of all. Ozu is the character that I assume he is the most annoying character of all the characters. He's a bully, stabs his best friend from behind, and often takes advantage of others. But, for some reason, every episode of this character changes frequently. Like for example, he still helps Watashi even though he has thrown him away. So, this character also has characteristics who didn't easy to guess his way of thinking. Akashi is a good junior to Watashi because she always helps him when Watashi is full of despair. For Watashi, Akashi is the best of all. Though like that, I don't see anything striking about this character even though I'm not thinking about it too much. Seitarou Higuchi is a senior even a teacher for Watashi and Ozu. I can also accept it because this character always has its attitude on all characters. The principle is somewhat diligent although he sometimes likes a bad guy in this anime. However, he sometimes always makes others more inspired by his presence.\\n\\n\r\nYojouhan Shinwa Taikei is a mindblowing anime of all the anime I've ever seen even though there are some like this for me. In a way, I resemble to enjoy this anime at all but sometimes it's not like that. Although sometimes the animations always make me a little shaky, the story in this anime is cover up. Using a backward-forward flow with the memory of the main character is always deleted. So, don't be surprised if you also always feel like there is some lack or always annoying with the main characters who always choose the wrong path or so. Because in fact, it's just like that. So, for myself, this anime is very nice to watch because it's a bit troll and deceive the mind of its audience.\\n\\n\r\nYojouhan Shinwa Taikei is the most beautiful anime I've ever seen if I see from every aspect. Some of which I like because this anime brings a lot of literary references in it so it makes me more fall in love with this anime. You could say this is an anime that has no end story at all and will never end. It's not a lot of people too if this anime is unknown in Indonesia who prefers something more overrated than the underrated ones. Even so, this anime is a bit insinuating the life of each individual if I refer more deeply because, in life, we should not regret what we have taken it. Always be grateful to the people around you and just live according to your conscience. No exaggeration and no shortage of each. Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei maybe I can recommend to everyone because this is not an anime you guys think. This is something you will never watch again than any other anime.",

            "content": "I don't think any other anime had the same instantaneous impact on me as Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei did upon finishing the final episode. I also can't recall any other anime becoming one of my favourites so quickly. \r\nOne of my absolute favourite aspects of the show is how the show is how the plot slowly unravels over the course of the show. One might say that this should be a basic storytelling requirement, but rarely is a piece of art able to accomplish this with the perfect pacing that Tatami Galaxy has. The way in which uses the plot device as a means of world-buildingis masterful; small, seemingly insignificant details pop-up in multiple timelines, and often transform into much bigger, considerably less insignificant details, which allows the world and the characters within it feel genuinely real. I found myself becoming more attached to these people than in any anime I've ever watched, aside from perhaps Hunter x Hunter, and the experience of realising this during the last episode made me tear up slightly.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what's most interesting about this is how the creators were able to meticulously piece together this puzzle before the viewers eyes over the course of 11 episodes, while simultaneously moving the story along at breakneck speed. One possible flaw would be that reading the subtitles while taking in the events on screen is incredibly difficult, although I will say that my speed-reading skills improved significantly by the end.\\n\r\nBut this wasn't done without reason, as it accurately conveys the mentality of the protagonist, who drastically overthinks every decision he has to make; a flaw I assume most people can relate to (as the writers most likely realise). \\n\\n\r\nThis anime's greatest achievement, though, would be the insane visuals. Never before have I seen a piece of animation with the level of visual storytelling of Tatami Galaxy. Most of the animation is used to represent the inner workings of the protagonists mind - visual metaphors are in abundance here. I don't think this show would be anywhere near as good without the the level of detail and love put into every second of the animation. I believe that for something to have god-tier animation, I should be able to understand the ideas and concepts without the sound turned on, and the show goes above and beyond this requirement. I'm sure I would be able to understand the ideas, concepts, plot and characters arcs with no sound or subtitles to guide me, simply through the genius-level direction of  Masaaki Yuata. \\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, I have refrained from stating any of the aformentioned ideas and concepts, simply because (as someone who myself went in completely blind) I would say that part of my enjoyment of the series was discovering all of it myself as the show went on, and watching the mural unfold before my eyes without any knowledge of where it would go or which direction it would take. Never has a piece of art taught me so much about myself and many of the toxic mentality's that have held me back from enjoying the simpler joys of life, and given me the motivation to go out and do exactly that. Without a doubt, The Tatami Galaxy earns its place as one of the greatest anime of all time, and one of my own personal favourites ever.\\n\\n\r\n10/10. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This will be my review to the anime 'Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei', also more well-known as 'The Tatami Galaxy'. From this point on I will refer to this anime as Tatami Galaxy. Tatami Galaxy is done by the studio MADHOUSE, a studio most if not all anime watchers know about. MADHOUSE has been one of the old and big anime studios from the past. Even though they still exist their might has long since been gone. Tatami Galaxy though is part of their golden age when MADHOUSE made one timeless classic after another, this being one of them. Tatami Galaxy is written by Masaaki Yuasa, oneof anime industries biggest geniuses, and I am not exaggerating in the slightest. Tatami Galaxy has long since been established as a anime high elitist anime. By that I mean an anime that's been associated as a high-grade masterpiece. Now that I've rambled enough, let's get to this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Story: Without spoiling anything of the plot twists or anything similar; the story revolves around Watashi, a young man who just entered the high-school life. Shortly, he is during one visit at a local ramen stall being accompanied by a strange man who tells him he will bind either Watashi or Ozu to Atashi as a love partner with the thread of love. Atashi is a pretty girl with black hair who Watashi has fallen for. Ozu, on the other side is a fellow he met and befriended during his high-school life.\\n\r\nEach episode shows Watashi taking another route in his life, choosing a different club he joins during that time.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story isn't as grand as it seems, it gets better. Trust me. And that's actually all I can say without spoiling too much. The core of this anime lies in the characters anyway.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Just outstanding. It is not any downright expensively detailed anime, it is the art of the anime that is typical for Yuasa that gives this anime the high art quality it deserves. The opening and ending are also both very stylish and fit the anime well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Apart from the heavily SFX-based sound both the opening and ending song are great. They reflect the nature of the anime. I have nothing to say against it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Yes, the characters. The heart of this show. As well as the message this anime delivers through the main character Watashi. Easily influenced and easy to forget important things or to not see things as clearly as they are. Ozu, a fiendish man who lives to make other people's lives miserable. Often described as a man-yokai. Akashi, an ambitious young woman who does what she does best. Working seriously. She's like the type of girl who once she gets into something she is determined to do it with her all. Even if it's a bit stupendous. There are of course a few more characters in this but describing them as well is 1. too much for this review and 2. takes away from experiencing them yourself. This is supposed to be just a small appetizer to start watching the show. So go watch it! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & verdict: Yes, of course I enioyed it. I gave it a high 9/10. Some people might lynch be for not giving it a round 10 but that's just how it is. Deal with it. I also do recommend it but only to veterans in the anime fandom. This might be an anime that would scare away beginners with its fast pacing, tons of dialogue and weirdness. Tatami Galaxy is not an anime I can easily describe for a spoiler-free review. Trust me in that this show is truly a good one. The score on MAL does not lie this time, it's even not high enough. I know this is a bit of a half-assed review but this is the best that I can do right now. \\n\\n\r\nTatami Galaxy is great. \\n\\n\r\nAnd with that, see you in my next review.",

            "content": "\"being different and being good are not the same thing\". me.\r\nI usually watch anime by their rating, and I wasnt let down once. Until Tatami Galaxy. It's so horrifyingly horrendous that if I lose my concentration now I would not be able to finish the review. A mystery anime is good when it tries to make you brainstorm about the story/plot, not wasting time figuring out what is the content of the narration with full of redundant, complex, lengthy sentences speaking at 2x speed. Even reading sub didnt help much \r\nStory. 1/10\r\nthe whole plot of the anime can be explained in 2 minute scene withFortune Teller saying whatever it is about no matter what you choose it would be the same if you dont pick the right choice, and instead they tried to drag it into 11 eps with so much repetitions. Watching this anime be like walking into a maze, and then after 6 hours, you come out getting nothing but a pat on the head from the adult saying \"good job performing a difficult task. you get nothing son\". And then you feel like a super hero for being able to suffer such a challenge, and brag about it but in the end of the day you will never ever do it again. But me, I started walking halfway into the maze, and then I realized what was waiting for me at the end, and then I teleport out and say \"no thank you i dont need this crap\".\\n\\n\r\nArt. 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nIf story is an edgy kid trying to be different, then why not the art? Sure lets join the edgy circle. But I'll mince my words and put it simple. Art is different, but it doesnt click me. move on\\n\\n\r\nSound. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinishing the anime for half an hour (dropping to be precise), and all I could recall is the part when Seitarou sang at the river. And since I dont remember the sound at all considering I just watch it half an hour, it will fit the group \"bland and forgettable at most\". And ED may scare people with trypophobia. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 3/10\\n\r\nWhat's an anime without characters? more like What's an edgy anime without edgy characters? The only acceptable, sane character in this anime is Akashi. The rest are so inhuman, unreal that sometimes i think they are just a bunch of ideas being humanized and put into the anime to make it more edgy (spoil me if it is actually correct)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 1/10\\n\r\nThe plot is not even new, the narrative is way too fast with redundantly lengthy sentences, art is indifferent at most, sound is forgettable. 9/10 of the anime is filled with nonsense, so i would give it a solid 1/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall. 1/10 but if only i was an elitist who like to ask my friend hey have you watch this anime or that anime while naming a bunch of hardcore stuffs, and posted on different social networks \"Your name is overrated trash\" then I would give it 10/10.\\n",

            "content": "Best of the best. Makes you believe in animation as the best medium for storytelling. Makes you laugh and feel pits of despair simultaneously. Makes you intimately familiar with a cast of characters, so eccentric and wacky and yet so developed you could guess their favorite flavor of ice cream.\r\nI was already deeply in love with Masaaki Yuasa and Tomihiko Morimi's other collaboration, \"Night is Short, Walk on Girl\", which in the past year has catapulted itself into becoming one of my all-time favorite films. Tatami Galaxy (or 4.5 Tatami Mythological Chronicles) is not quite as magnificent as that movie, but it's pretty darn close.This thing's as close to perfection as a TV anime is going to get, I imagine.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire thing follows this formula of a self-defeating, cynical college student going through alternate timelines, picking different clubs and trying to achieve great success, but continuously failing. Through this you get to see a dozen different angles of the same cast, meeting and interacting and falling into the same storylines. Like any formula-based series, though, the anime is best when it suddenly diverges from the expected and goes its own way, subverting the formulas to show you something new that you hadn't considered. When Tatami Galaxy does this, it does it with a narrative skill I don't think I've ever seen in another story before. Like, geez.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the only TV show I have ever watched in one sitting; I just never have the patience to sit through a bunch of episodes in a row... except for with Tatami Galaxy. Holy crap is this show good.",

While watching, it was my biggest issue cause I can fully believe that the story itself was a masterpiece in its design, where it was a deeply relatable story with memorable characters that brought an almost unparalleled sense of reality to the table, an exceedingly rare feat.  \r\nHowever, outside of even thevisual appearance, Tatami also drug its feet in full development of characters and the plot, and at times left me wishing it could have been improved and in some points even reworked entirely- especially in terms of pacing. But in the ending, I felt as if the climax and conclusion was rushed. Overall I give the Tatami Galaxy an 7/10, all the while I admit, wistfully wishing it was better; because, the story has such an enormous potential that ended up through a few flaws, short of its full fruition.",

I may also commit some grammar mistakes, as English isn't my native language.\\n\\n\r\nTatami Galaxy was an anime I decided to watch on a whim, I didn't care much for it after reading its description, thinking it wouldn't be all that interesting... Well, I have to say it was one of the best decisions I have made.\\n\\n\r\nThe very first episode had me hooked. Now, before I go any deeper, I must say -\\n\\n\r\nDo not judge this anime based on its Art (that is, if it doesn't suit you the very first time you look at it). The art is quite different and the characters rather exquisite, but this has a purpose, it fits the theme beautifully, and in fact, after 1 or 2 episodes you understand why it looks the way it does and it grows on you.\\n\\n\r\nTatami Galaxy shows us something many of us have thought about before:\\n\\n\r\nWhat would I do if I had the chance to go back in time and do things differently? How would I change my path? What could I improve? Would I have the guts to ask that girl out?\\n\\n\r\nObviously, this isn't the first time a form of media deals with this issue, however, the difference here is how they present it, which is magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll just have to trust me on this one and watch it for yourself because no amount of words will do justice to it.\\n\\n\r\nI know I said I would not give separate scores here, but I must point out that the sound in this anime is really great.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're tired of formulaic/generic/typical anime or just want to try something new, this is the one to shoot for. You won't be disappointed.",

I luuuved it!\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the Music is great. Opening theme is pretty charming and upbeat\u2026and the closing theme is just fucking beautiful to listen to and really fits the mood of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow\u2026an issue many people have with this show is the dialogue \u2026.it can be fast\u2026extremely fast in fact..which to non-Japanese speaking viewers can be a huge turn off as our main character Watashi goes into motor mouth monologues in almost every episode which results in HYPER FAST English subtitles that require pausing at times. This was admittedly a minor issue for me as well since Watashi spouts a lot of witty and comical information very fast\u2026.but to be honest I could see it was part of his charm and awkward personality to talk that way and eventually I found I got used to it.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that I really enjoyed the other voice actors and I would ABOSOLUTELY LOVE an English dub of this show\u2026which should have already happened since Funimation have already licensed this series but just have not dubbed it yet for some odd reason\u2026.a serious wtf there tbh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this show are very likeable and three dimensional. As the series progresses you get to understand more and more about the supporting characters and as such they grow on you more and more and I certainly appreciated that.\\n\\n\r\nWatashi himself\u2026is kind of the loveable nerd dumbass\\n\\n\r\nHe is that kind of Woody Allen type that is smart in some ways but is utterly naive and pessimistic in others which does make the show that much more comical but can be irritating in some other situations he gets himself into.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the series you will come to realise most of the characters do not tend to be the predictable archetypes they seemed to be in the beginning and I found that to be an extremely pleasant surprise.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on a side note it was bloodly hilarious to see Watashi constantly arguing with his mental \u201cJohnny\u201d who looks creepily similar to a particularly well known Walt Disney character lol\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nOnce again the overwhelming hype of this show is what initially drew me towards it and I have to admit at first it was a little bit of a chore to watch as things were a bit all over the place at the start but as time went on and I started to watch the series more slowly\u2026even re-watching one or two episodes\u2026it really grew on me and I can see why many people are drawn to this off beat and uniquely animated time twisted comedy drama.\\n\\n\r\nValue\\n\\n\r\nValue for this show is very high for me. I would love to watch this again in a good English dub and pick up each and every joke while enjoying the crazy animation style because tbh I let a couple of things go over my head as this show does move quite fast in terms of dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s nice to see something totally different in anime every once in a while and this show is not that long (11 episodes) so I\u2019d say check it out, however i would be lying if I said I\u2019d thought this show is for everyone\u2026it\u2019s too offbeat for me to say it has a broad appeal that almost anyone could enjoy\\n\\n\r\nI think if you watch 3 episodes you\u2019ll know if you\u2019d like it or not\u2026.for me I\u2019d say it was pretty good in Japanese but would be even better with an English dub\u2026.a quality English dub\u2026by the guys who already have the US distribution rights\\n\\n\r\nMake it happen Funimation\u2026.Make it happen damn you!\\n\\n\r\nPlanet Tyro Rating: Solid B\\n\\n\r\nVisual Version: http://bit.ly/19h1xFr\\n\\n\r\nplanettyro.com",

            "content": "The Tatami Galaxy is a unique series that pushes the boundaries of conventional anime. It's a coming-of-age story of a young adult that involves time travel, discovering one's self, appreciation of what you have, and more.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nTatami Galaxy manages to flesh out a fantastic story in merely 11 episodes. It doesn't feel too short nor does it feel too long. It wraps the story up so that it doesn't leave you feeling awkward. I would have given it a 10/10, had it not been for the fact that, at times, it does seem repetitive. But then again, such is the nature of the story dueto the way it employs time travel. I also marathoned it, so that is another reason why. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe artistic style is by far the show's strongest point. The show uses a minimalist style that doesn't come off as amateur, weak, or \"we're low on budget so just get the damn thing done.\" It's a breath of fresh air compared to conventional anime. Additionally, it employs real life stills/video and seamlessly incorporates it into the anime. It would seem that the use of monochromatic colors would hurt the show, but it instead adds to its strength by giving flavor to each episode. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nGreat music and great soundtrack. Although most of the songs are great as in \"it's great in a film, but I wouldn't listen to it without the film\" there are quite a few tracks that can stand alone. The opening song (and sequence) really captures the essence of the show. It should be noted that the opening song was by Asian Kung-Fu Generation. The ending song was good as well, but it didn't captivate me as much as the opening song did. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThis would have been a 10/10 were it not for a few hiccups. There were a couple of characters that were not fleshed out enough, and some of the characters can even be interpreted as a mirrors for the different aspects of the main character's personality, but I think this has to do with the nature of the story itself, as well as an unreliable narrator. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Tatami Galaxy, and I plan on re-watching it again so that I can better appreciate it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThe score speaks for itself. One concern I had was the lack of dubs. While I usually watch subs, this is one show that really needs a dub due to the fast pace dialogue. It can be quite difficult to keep up with the conversations and monologues. Honestly, there were times where I had to pause to read the text. The biggest drawback is that because you have to spend an above average amount of focus and energy on reading the subs, you thus fail to give the animation its appropriate attention. Nonetheless, you do eventually adapt to its pace, and it does get easier to watch as you move on. \\n",

            "content": "Tatami Galaxy was genius. It's rare to find an anime that is as unique, thought-provoking, artful, clever, painfully real and beautiful at the same time. It left a lasting impression on me and will not be forgotten for a long time.\r\nBut I don't think this show is for everybody. The concepts are pretty hard to grasp, and I can understand how someone could become confused, scared or angry after watching. I don't think it's a matter of intelligence, but rather of the viewer's psychological state. I personally felt a connection to it as a 20 year old entering my third year of engineering school, andfelt like I shared a lot of similar thoughts with the main character. I would highly recommend this to the salty singles who thrive in the darkness and enjoy being alone, or somebody who's bored and looking for something unique.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nAt first I was a little confused by the plot line, but after finishing the final episode it all made sense. The first two episodes actually left me really depressed. I believe the synopsis described the plot as a kind of supernatural journey, but I don't think that's really correct; it's something a little more intricate than your typical time-travelling show. I'll leave it up to you to decide after watching it yourself because that's not the purpose of this review. The plot is very detailed and you will be left with questions that are answered in following episodes, so don't give up when you're feeling confused. It's pretty outstanding how well they integrated every detail and definitely deserves my 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is definitely a notable point of this anime. It's unique from any other anime I've seen and because of it, carves its own place in my mind. Though it doesn't really contribute to the quality of the art, I was kind of relieved that the characters actually had squinty eyes. Not a point of criticism, but I feel that in too many shows the characters have eyes that are so big they make my own eyes water, and don't even remotely look like their ethnicity. I still enjoy the art of large eyed anime's a lot, but I just noticed Tamami Galaxy's squinty eyes. Putting that aside, I hope you will appreciate the quality of Galaxy's unique artwork yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI'm including voice acting as part of the sound. The main character's voice actor was amazing. I don't understand Japanese and the main character had blazing fast soliloquies, but you could still make out every syllable (not that I understood, but it was pretty amazing to listen to). The music did a pretty good job adding drama to the show as well, but I think it was mainly the main character's voice acting that drives my rating up to a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nI really liked how the characters were developed in this anime. All the characters are seen from the perspective of the unnamed protagonist (I believe he was called 'Watashi' in the character list, but if I'm not mistaken that just means 'me'), and each time they appear you will discover a bit more about their intentions, methods and even appearance through their speech and their actions. The main exhibit of the series was the progress of the protagonist's views on the world as he traverses the Tatami Galaxy. I won't discuss that because its meaning is quite open to interpretation. Anyways, if you enjoy anime that is centered around character development, you might be interested to watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI think that it was kind of a difficult watch for most of the season, maybe because of the page long subtitles that flashed on the screen every couple seconds. It's also pretty hard to grasp what's going on for the majority of the show, which is why I can understand why people wouldn't like it and would be turned away without finishing it. Personally, watching the first two episodes left me quite depressed, but not sad. Well, my point is that it was very relatable for me and I found an inexplicable motivation to finish watching the series without any rational reason. I found the ending to be very satisfying and well thought out, and I only found that I enjoyed it after I'd finished watching it, so don't give up!\\n\r\nI loved Akashi. The things she said to the protagonist were so subtle but at the same time so perfect that it I found myself giggling like a little girl. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThe genius plot, rapid-fire voice acting, beautiful art and relatable characters were all excellent. The quality in which it was all produced was excellent. The design was excellent. It was all so original that I wouldn't really  compare it to anything I've seen before. Absolutely mind-blowing whenever I think about it. \\n\r\nI personally found that Tatami Galaxy was really amazing, but again, I can understand why people may be dissuaded from finishing the series or miss out in enjoying it. Regardless, I will still recommend it 9001% to anyone who's looking for an anime that's unique.",

            "content": "I get what the message is here. I really do. In fact, I'm the guy who SHOULD be getting the most out of this series, considering I'm around the same age as the protagonist and have many similar experiences. But I felt like the message just fell flat, for various reasons.\r\nThe anime \"The Tatami Galaxy\" is an episodic anime, so the episodes, for the most part, don't relate to each other (aside from the fact that the protagonist is going back in time to relive a part of his life a different way each episode). Seeing the different ways the protagonist lived his life aswell as the various running gags playing out differently each time was entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as I'm giving this series a 6/10, there are a few problems. First off, at LEAST one of the episodes was honestly just too weird for me. And this is coming from a guy who has watched a LOT of anime. I couldn't relate to the events happening and I couldn't tell if they were supposed to be played straight or played for comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, and more importantly, I could tell that the series was building up to some sort of grand conclusion that tied everything together. The protagonist was going to find love, pick the right girl, etc. That's what was hinted at the whole time. But then the series wove another message into the story, and the big reveal of that came two episodes BEFORE the final episode. This left the final two episodes to have another random rewind, and those two episodes were honestly just tedious and boring.\\n\\n\r\nThen the \"real\" ending. The real ending, in my opinion, was bad. First off, the protagonist realizes something about another main character that, honestly, I did not believe. The series did not do a good enough job convincing me of that point, so it fell horribly flat. Then, they finally get to that big \"do the right thing\" moment, and...they blow it off. The \"resolution\" happens in 3 seconds and then they LAUGH about not showing more of it. Yes, in the actual show.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, for me, everything the show built up to fell flat. I'm the kind of guy that needs a good ending to tie a story together. If the ending doesn't satisfy me, ultimately it leaves the whole show in a bad light. If you can appreciate the journey a bit more than I do, or if you can except the premise they introduce at the end, you might really enjoy this series. I, on the other hand, found it only average.",

            "content": "MILD SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is about a university student who is stuck in a time loop, and when he is dissatisfied with the current time loop he goes back in time to a point which the protagonist(Watashi) specifies at the end of each episode(unaware of the time loop), each time joining a different 'circle' in search of a 'rose coloured life'. \r\nThis anime utilises the time loop in a very clever way, by having each episode focus on a different circle and at the end having the time loop occur so the next episode will have a different circle, which makes this anime episodic,however some of the circumstances that may have occurred in each episode will still be in the following episodes albeit slightly changed because Watashi himself has changed his life by going back in time and joining different circles. \\n\\n\r\nAt the first 9 episodes it has this episodic theme to it, which and it may sound repetitive, but its not, each episode may have similar themes to it but the actual content to each and Watashi's perspectives is completely different which makes it quite entertaining. This all builds up to create the best conclusion i have ever seen in the last two episodes, which plays with all of the previous themes but there is one major difference and this difference cause the time loops to stop. This conclusion tells the viewer a powerful message of living life to its fullest, and one could find many more messages that this show is telling the reader. The Tatami Galaxy completely disregards most anime tropes and creates such a fresh and original experience that it felt like watching anime for the first time, the originality in this show however may not be up to everyone as the way it's narrated and the way the plot is presented is such an alien experience to the causal anime fan, however for those who are not put off by it, watch it, you'll will love the conclusion and everything about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very cartoonish and fluid so this also may not be for the most people as the art style's originality may be discredited as it is so different from all of the other generic anime art style's, which truly makes this anime one of a kind. But if you are fine with the art style, than this will be an enjoyable watch for you as the art style really helps to bring about this anime's originality and beauty. The sound for this anime is quite stellar, the opening is very catchy and is accompanied by a amazing visuals, the ending is also accompanied by great visuals but the vocals in it are very good. The OST through The Tatami Galaxy is incredible as well and it emphasises the most important and memorable moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of The Tatami Galaxy aren't really the focus point of it but each character is unique in their own way, this really adds to the originality of the show, and in each different circle their actions and Watashi's perceptions of them may change but the message they are portraying don't change. Each character sticks out in their own way and this makes the show more memorable for the viewer, and at the conclusion each characters is involved, they each have a part to play to emphasise their own specific messages.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those anime, that doesn't need stunningly animated fight scenes or the breathtaking visuals to stand put but instead an intelligible audience which can truly appreciate it for all of its wacky weirdness and beautiful storytelling. I would recommend anyone to watch it as it is a very original experience as it stands out from the classic norm in terms of art style, and the way the plot is presented.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "' Life is not meant to be sought or measured, life is meant to be lived.'\r\nAn anime that holds no need for superficial or amazing concepts to be successful, it's  just a realistic story executed in a masterful way...ladies and gentlemen i present you = Tatami Galaxy\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStory : 10/10 - Outstanding\r\nTatami Galaxy is set in Kyoto if i'm not mistaken, well it's not that important ,it's just one of those Japanese towns. Our MC, 'Watashi', a freshman engineering student,  expects to find the 'rose colored campus life' that he always dreamed of, entering a campus club (circle) to meet 'the raven-haired girl ofhis dreams'. After joining a club in his first year,he meets Ozu, another freshman student in his department who has a very misfit persona. 2 years pass and at the same time he contemplates his affection for  another engineering student, Akashi, and makes promises to her, usually of and within a romantic subtext. Now In his 3rd year, instead of reaching his \"rose colored campus life dream\" he finds mischief and disappointment, he also doesn't find a chance to ask out Akashi, long story short: everything goes wrong as he ends up regretting his club choice, wanting to go back to the moment of choosing it resets his life and  he changes his choice.  BUT, as  he joins a different club, everything seem to go wrong again despite changing his choice and again he ends up regretting his choice and resets again. This goes on and on as he always ends up regreting his choice and resets , also his dubious missions often conflict with his interest in Akashi in some way as he always ends up not having a chance to ask her out. The plot is following his different choices and the different lives he lived after them. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, this formula of \"resetting\" continues on until the last two episodes but eventually it leads to one of most satisfying conclusions you can ever see in an anime.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 - Great\\n\\n\r\n'It's  inventive and distinctive and regularly beautiful'. \\n\\n\r\nSeen as poor by many, the art of Tatami Galaxy is gravely underrated but the funny thing is that Tatami Galaxy won the grand prize for the animation category in the Japan Media Arts Festival on December 8, 2010. It was the first time a TV animation series won the grand prize.\\n\\n\r\nArt effectively depicts the themes of the show, It will regularly spin through a dozen visual styles in a single minute, combines gloriously abstract representations and actual live footage sometimes, illustrates its protagonists\u2019 barreling inner monologue through an endless buffet of visual metaphors. And all that visual stuff doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum, either - it is an integral part of the storytelling, and the two compliment each other perfectly.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 - Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nA testament to the superb voice acting could be that, even though 'Watashi's speech is faster than a bullet train, he still manages to keep the viewer in his toes with his smart (and funny) take on many different subjects and make him feel whatever emotion he emits. Akashi's and Ozu's voice are on spot too.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it fits great with the theme and mood of the series, successfully representing the constant changes in atmosphere, from the melancholic \"Youjou han to Castella to Watashi\" to the mysterious \"Kamotaketsunuminogami\" and powerfully liberating \"Yojouhan Ki Owari\" or \"Takasegawa\" and of course, hands down to OP:  \"Maigoinu to Ame no Beat\" by Asian Kung-Fu Generation completely catches the theme of the show and captures you with it's beat, you can't help but to sing along. ED theme is \"Kami-sama no Iut\u014dri (\"As God Dictates\") has a completely different air to it that captures you, oh and after the end of 10th episode , you will look to ED in a different way , i assure you.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 - Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nCast is the recipe for instant success. You will immediately fell in love with them.\\n\r\nI will briefly describe the 3 main characters and  one of the supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\n1) MC : 'Watashi' is a young college student in the engineering department who never seizes to amaze with his sarcastic and dark but witty dialogues on everything he analyzes. He is the source of the dialogues and monologues in Tatami Galaxy, and his themes vary from social commentary to self - sarcasm of the highest caliber. He entered college dreaming of the \"rosy campus life\"  and wanting to meet the 'raven-haired girl of his dreams', which is why he joins a new social circle/club in each episode. \\n\\n\r\n2) Ozu is another college student in the engineering department. Misfit, dark and devilish character, who constantly drags 'Watashi' to troubles. He's often the one manipulating the other characters against the protagonist. He also seems to care for the protagonist, and rescues him on certain occasions from sticky situations, they have a complicated relationship, as series progress it becomes more clear. \\n\\n\r\n3) Akashi, is another college student in the engineering department , is an adorable female character, and 'Watashi's biggest love interest. She is commonly the center of the protagonist's affections, she acts rationally and even coldly towards most people, but often shows hints of affection to the protagonist. Her fear of moths also contrasts with her normally calm demeanor. She often appears in the same club that the protagonist joins, though her main club is 'Birdman circle', some sort of engineering circle that designs Light Sport Aircrafts.\\n\\n\r\nHiguchi is a stoic, and full with dreams on exploring the globe, he 's originally introduced as a deity of matrimony (god of marriage) in the first episode, but he is depicted in the rest of the series as an eighth year student living in the same dorm as the protagonist. He also has many hidden sides, which made him mysterious, spiritual and occasionally wise.\\n\r\nThere are more supporting characters that are also very interesting like another eight year student, Masaki J\u014dgasaki, but doesn't quite measure up to the other mentioned above. However, there is not a single character that is not likable in this series, because of their quirks and personality.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nFully enjoyed of every minute of the show, especially the last episode.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 - Outstanding + Masterpiece \\n\\n\r\nMasterpiece is pretty much the word when it comes to Tatami Galaxy - every element of its production glimmers with polish.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's not everyone's cup of tea and some even call it '2deep4u' despite it's simple messages , for example:\\n\\n\r\n*Do not let your dreams like \" I want a rose-colored life\"  blind the already beautifully colored life you have been living all along , it does not have to be rose colored, it's beautifully colored as it is. Don't project your failures and personal ugliness outwards,  embraces all the cracks and imperfections that made your life worth living, take responsibility for your own journey.\\n\\n\r\n*Do not let your dreams like  \" I want to be with raven haired girl of my ideals\"  blind you, just seize the opportunity in front of you and open up to girl you want to open up to, yes, that adorable girl right in front of you : that girl who liked your silly movies, that girl who enjoyed your silly performances, that girl who wanted to visit your favorite ramen shop with you,\\n\\n\r\n' Life is not meant to be sought or measured, life is meant to be lived.'\\n\r\nThis show\u2019s answer to the question of the meaning of life seems to be \u201cdrink your tea.\u201d  To put it briefly :  Show is telling you ' just live to YOUR fullest ', \\n\\n\\n\r\nFor me this is one of the greatest series I've ever seen, The Tatami Galaxy deserves  an EXTREMELY OBVIOUS 10/10 from the overall score.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nLAST WORDS: People don't call this show masterpiece for no reason, it's truly a hidden gem,  This may be the best show you haven't watched, i can't say enough about how good the show is. It's whimsical, funny, yet deep, sending a good and yet a simple message to us all. The characters seem pretty 'normal' at first, but at the end, you can't help but to love every single one of them. It's a very experimental, yet cleverly put together show. Minute for minute this was one of the most worthwhile watching experiences I've ever had, anime or not.  Overall an extremely charming and colorful  piece of work, one that I'll NEVER forget.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly you have to watch it to understand it but after you watch it,  it WILL to be in your top 10 , maybe 5.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, that\u2019s The Tatami Galaxy,  a perfect little tatami box of its own. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "This hidden gem sure deserves a perfect 10 from me.\r\n--------------CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Summary-Watashi is like the adult version of nobita, except way better and funnier too. All he wants an enjoyable college life ,he desperately repeats the first 2 years of his college life going back and forth into the past  to change his decisions to make his 2 years of high school life rememberable , searching for the \"rose-colored campus life\", and the \"raven-haired maiden\" that supposedly awaits him. The last 2 episodes of the anime is where I realized this anime is a true gem. After the first episode, I was deeplyinvolved into the story as it somewhat similar to my highschool days (sad, I couldn't change my decisions though).\\n\\n\\n\r\n~At first glance, I was really worried, whether the anime will live upto my expectations as its only 11 episodes long. So, the plot might be fastforward towards the end but, fortunately I was wrong. After watching this original anime masterpiece, I realized I shouldn't judge an anime based on its episode count.\\n\\n\r\nGenres-Mystery, Romance, Psychological,Comedy (I wonder why MAL didn't put comedy tag in it, it was quite funny at times)\\n\\n\r\nStory-10/10 (Every episode is different and tells us from a unique point of view,but gradually you wiill start noticing the pattern that's the best part about this series)\\n\\n\r\nSound-10/10 (Sound is just beautiful, specially the ending song \"\"Kamisama no Iutoori\" The voice is so smooth and cute, you just fall in love with it)\\n\\n\r\nArt-10/10 (Needless to say, Its done by Madhouse but, its way different from any other anime you have seen in a good way,it sometimes picks real images from life and making it a lot more realistic and appealing too)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-10/10 ( Every character is great, though sometimes Ozu becomes quite annoying but, I gained massive respect for this guy towards the end)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-over 9000 (Definitely has high rewatch value for me)",

            "content": "Bizarre, confusing, and yet mind-warpingly brilliant \u2013 what was initially an Asanuma Shintarou fact-finding mission on my part turned into a very trippy and fulfilling mind trip into the world of The (4.5) Tatami Galaxy.\r\nStory.\r\nWe kick start things with paragraphs on end of extremely quick narration from our protagonist, Watashi, who recounts his life as a fresh university student with hopes of achieving his desired \u2018rose-coloured campus life\u2019. Which circle does he choose? Where does he end up? Would he be happy in the tennis circle, the softball circle, the drama circle or the cycling circle? Would he be happy if he chose to meethis pen pal, to be with a life-sized doll or to go drinking with a friend of his? There are so many possibilities, permutations and combinations, that it is just so difficult to decide! However, this series does not leave viewers to speculate, because in what is a most fascinating take on repeated \u2018what if\u2019s, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei gives us a full blown account of how Watashi\u2019s life for the next couple of years would pan out depending on which circle he chose at the start of his university life. And that is the point at which the hands on the clock start spiralling out of control, because each episode after depicts Watashi\u2019s life, but that in a different club. It is as if we hit the \u2018reset\u2019 button at the end of each episode and Watashi gets a retake on the past two years of his life. One would think that's a convenient setting \u2013 Don't like it? Then just redo it. But at what point do we keep turning back time? How many times do we repeat life until we are satisfied with its outcome? That really, is what I believe to be Yojouhan's overarching theme, and it was one that the series not only addressed, but explored very thoroughly and very satisfyingly.\\n\\n\r\nWith Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, perseverance is key because three episodes in and it seems as if the story is still going pretty much nowhere. Add to that the episodic first-person narrative of the series, and what we get is a recount (on steroids) of the protagonist\u2019s life set on loop. It doesn\u2019t exactly sound that appealing, but just trust me on this, stick to it all the way to the end and what you will get is a really satisfying ending. Because while the episodic and repetitive nature of the series serves to confuse, it is this very style of narrative that definitely helps put Watashi\u2019s perspective across clearly. With each repetition, we get yet another piece of the tatami puzzle; with each repetition, we get more insight into all the different worlds that Watashi has lived in; with each repetition, this series manages to drive its point across even more clearly than before. And what's really impressive is how the series managed to weave the storyline from each parallel world so seamlessly. We had references here and there with the castella, the neko ramen and the proxy wars, to name a few, but none of them were at all out of place or mentioned in vain.\\n\\n\r\nJust what I love about this series is how thought provoking it turned out to be (at least, that is my take on it. What can I say? I like to think... lol). We saw the extent to which Watashi\u2019s life would be different depending on the choices he made \u2013 indeed, one\u2019s fate could change from the tiniest of choices. Watashi\u2019s ups and downs were central in showing us that, from him wanting that \u2018rose-coloured campus life\u2019, to him cooping himself up in his room (to that I say, viva hikkikomori lifestyle!), and finally to him agonising about being trapped in his tatami hell and fervently wishing that he had done ALL that he had done in the previous episodes upon traversing all the different parallel worlds. That really laid on the \u2018what if\u2019s oh so heavily and gets one thinking twice / thrice / many times over just what decision would be the would be the \"best\" decision.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I pause at the mention of the \"best\" decision. Because what really is the \"best\" decision? Looking back on the episodes, viewers went on the journey with Watashi as he experienced life in the various circles, and not one of them stood out as being the \"best\" outcome to me. Which then begs the question as to whether there really is such a thing as a 'rose-coloured campus life'. What is a 'rose-coloured campus life' in the first place? It was obviously a term that Watashi coined, and he was so caught up in the pursuit of his ideal, that he lost sight of what happiness stood right before his very eyes. And that was what really got to me, because I do think that we are often so overwhelmed in the pursuit of our notion of ideal that we do not live in the 'now'. My takeaway from Yojouhan: hold back on the obsessing; stop and smell the roses once in awhile.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nYojouhan has a series of very colourful characters, each playing a pivotal role in the story. There\u2019s our protagonist, whom we know only as Watashi, who takes us through his many parallel lives. Then there is his friend from the dark side of the moon, Ozu \u2013 Watashi's first encounter with his worst encounter. According to Watashi, 8 out of 10 people would believe Ozu to be a youkai if they saw him in the dark, while the remaining 2 could be convinced of it. He serves as the troublemaker in this series, eating the unhappiness of others as a topping on his rice, as Watashi so delicately puts it. And while Watashi is convinced that his soul would have stayed unblemished had he not met Ozu, he just can\u2019t seem to shake him off because the two are connected by the so-called black string of fate. We also have the level-headed Akashi, whom Watashi finally reaches out to, Jougasaki who is just sooo weird (seriously, a love doll? *shudder*), the senpai figure Higuchi and even a vague fortune teller whose fees just keep increasing lol (but I guess if her advice is legit, then why not?). These characters really do get up to some of the most amusing antics and there is never a dull moment watching their interactions. While comedy isn't the main aspect of this series, Yojouhan was still spot on with its humour and managed to incite a good number of laughs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\\n\r\nProduced in traditional animation by Madhouse under the direction of Masaaki Yuasa, this series is based on a novel written by Tomihiko Morimi. Story aside, the animation was different from most of the anime I have seen, but it took no time at all for me to get used to. High praise has to be given to Nakamura Yuusuke for his character design. The art in Yojouhan is not conventionally pretty, but part of its charm really was in the traditional animation, which was so psychedelic that that was what made it so special for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, Asanuma Shintarou was what brought me to this series. I stumbled upon it on his MAL page, on which I read a comment that his Watashi was the fastest anyone has spoken without stumbling. What happened after was a click on the Yojouhan page, the names Maaya Sakamoto (a personal favourite), Kaida Yuko, Yoshino Hiroyuki, Suwabe Junichi, Oohara Sayaka and Fujiwara Keiji, and I started on this series immediately. Overall, the voice acting was very well done \u2013 not too over the top (that\u2019s right, even with Asanuma\u2019s shinkansen talking speed), not too submissive, and complimented the characters beautifully. The seiyuus did wonderfully in bringing the characters to life while still retaining a whole lot of composure (honestly, this is difficult considering how whacky these colourful characters are). Notable mention has to be given to Asanuma, who in spite of the presence of many heavyweights, was undoubtedly the star of the series as Watashi. He had this raw quality in his delivery of Watashi's lines that really made the character so much more believable and relatable. In fact, Asanuma managed to capture the nuances of each Watashi so brilliantly, that I was very surprised when I read that this seiyuu is not professionally trained in voice acting. I liked him from Diamond no Ace and even more after Tokyo Ghoul, but his take on Watashi opened my ears to a whole new side of Asanuma and I really appreciate what he did with this role.\\n\\n\r\nMusic. While I loved the entire concept and delivery of Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, I must admit that the music was what made me like it so so much more. At the start, Ajikan\u2019s light, peppy and extremely happifying OP (in what I believe to be a very un-Ajikan outing), really gets viewers into the groove of the show. With lyrics that project our protagonist\u2019s thoughts (\u50d5\u305f\u3061\u306e\u73fe\u5728\u3092\u7e70\u308a\u8fd4\u3059\u3053\u3068\u3060\u3089\u3051\u3067\u3082 \u2013 To repeat this moment of ours), Yojoukan\u2019s OP sets the mood perfectly. This mood doesn\u2019t just end with the end of each episode, because the ED certainly leaves a very lasting impression. Ishiwatari Junji & Sunahara Yoshinori + Yakushimaru Etsuko are responsible for the hypnotic ending theme, Kamisama no Iu Toori. From the way the music filters in at the end of each episode, to the electronic instrumentation and the domino trail of tatami mats presented by the accompanying sequence, this ED exuded an air of mystery that really kept me drawn into the tatami world. Then of course, we have all the music in between, courtesy of Ooshima Michiru. In true Ooshima fashion, the OST is beautiful. She stuck to her classical roots with this OST (as always, with beautiful use of the various string instruments as well as the flute), but also spiced things up with hints of traditional and jazz influences. Her tracks really suit the atmosphere of this series and add many more dimensions to this already multi-dimensional world of a series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told I started watching Yojouhan on a mere whim, and purely out of curiosity (the storyline really intrigued me and the fact that it\u2019s noitamina was yet another pleasant discovery, because this time slot hosts some of the best series. That said, from the get go I was pulled into the warped world of 4.5 tatami rooms, unable to get out and not wanting to do so until I went through the entire spectrum of tatami worlds. Watching this was one of the best spur-of-the-moment choices that I could have made on a Sunday night (I literally watched till I fell asleep, woke up on Monday and continued watching till I finished it).

            "content": "The Tatami Galaxy is a tough nut of an anime.\r\nWith the extremely fast dialogue, the absolute minimum of explanations and the pretty normal premise, it's very easy to skip over this gem of a show.\r\nThat, or leave it on the backburner like I've had for ages.\r\nIf you dive into this anime, you'll be greeted by very episodic, well, episodes, that seem to tell quirky stories of 'what-ifs' for our protagonist. But I assure you that things really fall into place in the latter 2 or 3 episodes and, if you choose to pay close enough attention, you'll be rewarded with a wonderfully taught - ifquite simple - message.\\n\r\nGenerally I'm not a fan of these 'It'll get reaaaal good at the end, I promise!' shows, but Tatami definitely still delivers on every episode, unless you expected something very different (and I'm trying to tell you what to expect, do you get what's happening here, eh?)\\n\\n\r\nLooping back (which happens to also be a big point in the show) to the aforementioned 'what-ifs'.\\n\r\nIt's completely normal for people to think about missed chances, lost opportunities and a different path they could've taken.\\n\r\nEveryone wished to fix some mistake they did before, or take their life in a wholly new direction altogether.\\n\r\nBut even then, it's just a waste of time, why daydream of things that'll never happen instead of taking initiative, here and now, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, I won't really yap on even more, so here are the more detailed criticisms and praises for this show:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nLike hinted at, the show doesn't tell as much of a story as it teaches you a lesson, like old fairytales.\\n\r\nI gave the show a 10 because all the short what-ifs were always either funny, interesting or both, as well as just how well everything flowed into the final lesson.\\n\r\nAlso super impressed with all the tatami symbolism.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt's very stylised so I default to my 7.\\n\r\nThe show's well done, no big animation mistakes, variety in character design and all that wonderful stuff.\\n\r\nBut some people won't like it, solely because it's stylised, which annoys me personally, but I can't fault people for having tastes, can I?\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI absolutely adore the OP (still a mainstay in my playlist) and the eery ED.\\n\r\nOther than that, I'm afraid not much of the OST stuck with me.\\n\r\nVoice Acting (Japanese) seemed good too, but I can't really judge it, as I never bothered to learn it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI love the designs, I love all the different kinds of characters, I loved their interactions.\\n\r\nThe only thing I missed was the fact that some characters just never really amounted to any lesson or other climax.\\n\r\nThough that might just be me wanting even more of the show, so job well done, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt took getting used to, but after that, this show pretty much consumed me, leaving me as a lifeless husk to reconsider my life and future.\\n\r\n10/10 would have (yet another) existential crisis as a 23 year old again.\\n\\n\r\nAny closing words?\\n\r\nI dunno man, just binge it when you've got nothing to do for a weekend.\\n\r\nThis is one of the first times I was passionate enough about a show that I'm at a lack for words when it comes to my review.",

            "content": "The rating doesn't mean anything.\r\nAs expected of the allmighty Yuasa(worshipped by the scum that has LoGh as a fav before having seen it) he manages to make his work unique in every category, be it plot, narrative, characters, characterization or use of art, without seeming to brag about it. Good shows offer me the possibility to express, what I feel, makes a good show in general. If the show really is good, it will probably have done something different, so I will try to put special emphasis on just that.\r\nSince I'm not supposed to write a synopsis, you should know about the general setting already.Good? Good.\\n\r\nThe way the show works is that after an episode is finished, everything resets for the next one and the main character can choose another path to take in order to achieve a successfull and fulfilling college life...and a girlfriend, he wants a girlfreind too. Now while this is not the newest concept in itself, one can be assured to find all kinds of hints to what is going on or how everything is connected with each new repetition. While many things are different each time, there are some scenes, or objects that occur in every episode. Could these perhaps have a special meaning? Could symbolism play a part in all this too? \\n\r\nLook, I don't need to play the over analyzing nerd who watches a show four times to grasp every hidden detail, because Tatami Galaxy is NOT difficult to understand. The symbolism and metaphorical meaning of...everything basically is not all that cryptic. It's not necessarily obvious for anyone either, but with a bit of attention, and the knowledge that you have to look for these recurrences, you'll not just be able to understand everything easily, you'll perhaps even be able to guess ahead on what the story is going for. Though I didn't manage that beforehand, since the way everything is connected at the end is probably the most genius aspect of the narrative. Again, it's not difficult to understand, but it's nonetheless clever and what's more: Satisfying. I appreciate work that is properly thought through from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the characters? Well the main character (I shall name him \u201eElitist Prick\u201c, as he does not have a name otherwise) is an elitist prick visiting college, while being unsociable and speaking very fast*cough*.  His inner world and \u201eeveryday\u201c issues are what the show focuses on. It's when the expressive art is most useful, since you'll get a very good impression of what kind of person he is. And to make this clear: If you are watching Tatami Galaxy, he's probably you. \\n\r\nHis journey shines the brightest during the final episodes of the show. If the name \u201eGregor Samsa\u201c tells you something, you'll see the similar approach the anime is taking, while still doing it in a refreshing and, I would say, more meaningful way.\\n\r\nThe strengh of the remaining cast is everyone's affinity to being a bit stranger than anticipated. Normal people are boring, why focus on normal people? Wether your character is a mischief-causing unloyal little asshole repeatedly compared to the devil, an antisocial stuck-up bitch who still comes off as sympathetic(and surprisingly manages to not be a tsundere) or a popular jock who has a sexual relationship with a love doll, originality should be a given.  These characters and their relations to each other and to Elitist Prick are really refreshing and you will definitely miss them during the few episodes that only focus on Elitist Prick. And the thing is: That, to an extent, is the point of these few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen your chosen medium is animation, why don't you try to utilize all the advantages that medium can have? A thousend ways to reinforce your narrative through the art and you choose to simply write a script, have someone read it out and put some pictures above it. That's what most anime(even ones that don't warrant a naturalistic approach at all) are like in my view. You could show your character's emotions and situations through visualized metaphors, that you could sometimes even logically incorporate into the \"normal\" environment. You could exaggerate certain interactions, making them less naturalistic, but in turn more expressive. Or why don't you subtly include some life action frames to create a more uneasy, disturbing feeling of alienation? There's not even a need for something as sophisticated as that. How about you just literally visualize what your character is describing at a given moment, instead of having me look at him describe it. So please shows: Show, don't tell.\\n\\n\r\nDoes Tatami Galaxy show me? Yes, it very much does. Does it also tell me a whole fucking lot? Yes, it unfortunately does. But I'll get to that in a moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle itself is rather unique, since again: This is Yuasa. It is always refreshing to see something like this, but the most remarkable thing(as you may have guessed) is how the art is used to strenghten the narrative. You can always be sure that what is said in a scene is supported by the visuals in one way or another. It can be something grand and sophisticated or something simple and obvious. What matters most is that your experience as a viewer and your understanding of a character's mind can be greatly enhanced, as many emotions can not be conveyed with just words alone. That is how atmosphere is created. Yuasa understands that, since he is one of the few who actually try to employ any of these ideas and so he does with this show. \\n\\n\r\nI unfortunately can't say the same about the music though. It's simple to find out if the music used in a show is outstanding or not...do you remember any music? Well, I don't, I just know that there was some. The ending song is great though. It saddens me just a little bit though, because I know what Yuasa can do in this field. It doesn't do the show great harm though.  \\n\\n\r\nNow coming back to the topic of telling me a whole fucking lot: What is the first impression one will have when watching this anime? \u201eWho put the speed on x2?\u201c comes to mind. This is an important issue and it's not as harmless as fans make it out to be: Everyone speaks way too fast most of the time. It is very stressing to have to pause at any given moment, just to be able to read the subtitles. The reason you can't say \u201eThat's how it's meant to be\u201c is that that's clearly not how it's meant to be...well, yes the speed of speech may be supposed to be that fast, but clearly you're not supposed to watch this with subtitles at all. \\n\r\nYou're supposed to understand japanese, because if you do, it doesn't really matter how fast they talk, since listening is way easier than reading. That way you'll be able to follow what is happening easily and moreover you'll still be able to experience the art. THAT is how it's supposed to be. This show is anti-subtitles and has no dub, which can make the watching experience stressful. Why is this even important? Because it really is the worst aspect of the show...and it's not even the show's fault, it's our fault. Anyway, you have to know for yourself if you can handle this and fight yourself through. I recommend trying. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the exaggerated presentation of normal college life(library police=mafia), the strangeness of the characters, and the expressive use of art, the show manages to be relatable and believable. Next to all the unfamiliarities  thrown at you, you'll see how much this anime has to say about life in general. \\n\r\nIt would be a shame to miss out on that, wouldn't it? Yes, it would. So do it. \\n\\n\r\nBtw I don't hate Elitist Prick, but he's an elitist prick.",

Watching it, I thoroughly enjoyed it throughout. It was hilarious, it was thoughtful. I was planning on giving it 8-9/10. Then I got to the final episode, and I realized that it was truly a masterpiece. I realized how amazing this show was, and I had to tell others about it.\r\nThis show is unique from so many others. The characters are well fleshed-out, the story is touching, and the art is strange in the best ofways. Although I almost dropped it half-way through episode 1 - I was half-asleep, and trying to keep up with the rapidly changing animation and the protagonist's rapid speech was nearly impossible, I'm so glad I kept up with it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show about realizing the worth of what you have. About realizing how pointless and selfish it is to desire more in life when you already have so much. It is a truly touching display, and it couldn't have been done in a much more worthwhile and eye-opening way. I loved this show from the start, but the final episode made me reevaluate my own life and my own appreciation of what I have.\\n\\n\r\nShows like this are truly special. I really hope others are motivated to watch this, as for me, it was a much-needed foray into my own subconscious.",

            "content": "The Tatami Galaxy - 9/10\r\nThis show is vey hard to review, because this show structures itself around a meaning, a message. The story is a simple set-up of the main character entering college in search of a happy, pink-colored college life he was always dreaming of, to find an ideal girl. But soon after picking a club he gets into a lot of trouble, because of his friend Ozu building petty schemes and mad feuds, to the point he gets to the end of his two years realizing he has wasted his two years of life at college, he blames his friend, fate, or anythingthat he can blame, then the narrative stops and returns back to the beginning, showing now a whole new different possibility of his life, meaning that every episode is a re-telling of the same story with a big twist as to what club he goes to or what girl he decides to get close to, all of which end in him being in despair in a very unfavorable situation and thinking that he wasted his two years of college life. Not only is this concept incredibly unique, it's also very well done with each of the stories being interesting and not boring for the most part, and the way each is narrated with constant change of art style and pacing and dialogue, this is just maybe the best ride of all times, but wait, there is more! In the last few episodes, the protagonist walks around those parallel universes made of 4.5 tatami rooms, each featuring slightly different world, slightly different him and different stories to tell, but one thing he noticed, as a contrast to his choice in the last two episodes to be a shut-in and not join any club, all the other universes' versions of him were having fun, and seemed to have life happening around them. The point here is that instead of worrying about having chosen something wrong, giving up on something and convincing yourself that there are things you can't change or affect, a person should just do things, with no regret and enjoy his life, which by the way, can't be a dream pink-colored life, but a multi-colored one, where things don't always go according to the plan, but you should never give up on them nevertheless. Don't convince yourself you can't do something. But that's not the only good thing about Tatami Galaxy.\\n\r\nThe art style is very simplistic with little colors or detail mixed in with heavily edited actual film footage which makes it unique, and the producer used it very well.\\n\r\nThis show keeps up a good sense of humor, especially sometimes with it's satire and generally light mood, when compared to shows like Welcome to the NHK, which passed a feeling, emotion, this one passes thought, without becoming pretentious or boring with edgy over-played drama. The soundtrack I really liked, the episode BGM is great even though sometimes repetitive, op and ending songs are both great, work really well with the animation.\\n\r\nThe characters are very likable and unique, even though two-dimensional, but that's not the focus of the show, although the happenings around the main character are all relatable to some extent without becoming non-entertaining.\\n\r\nFlaws: None that i noticed, except some pacing was just slightly off.",

I would VERY STRONGLY recommend anyone watching this. \r\n(In fact, I just made an account here to post a review of this anime)\r\nYojohan Shinwa Takei (Otherwise known as \"The tatami galaxy\") manages to be humorous but meaningful and profound at the same time. The way it use of anime as a median is refreshing, in that it is unique and artistic, not at all derivative of other anime (A problem that I think lots of anime have) the art also goes very well with the themes of the show and the over all moral of the story. \r\nFurthermore, Im sure anybodywould enjoy this; whether or not they have prior context in anime. This is achieved in large by its incredibly well-constructed story, which is episodic, yet coherent, exposing sides of every character in a dynamic, puzzle-like way. \\n\r\nAs I stated earlier, the use of anime as a median is more creative than anything I've seen before; I truly believe FUNimation were pioneers in making this. However, this artistic merit is not only limited to the use of anime as a median. There are many motifs constantly firing off in the background (And the foreground) made to act as visual metaphors, events that seem unconnected at first become clear foreshadowing devices once said foreshadowed event happens. \\n\r\nThe tatami galaxy also had an EXTREMELY satisfying ending, every frustration and confusion the viewer experiences in the journey that is this show is explained, a conclusion is made and a very valuable (though slightly sugary) lesson is taught.\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this one is definitely a must watch for anybody who likes anime. Though slow to start, the viewer learns to love the show for its subtle hints and nuanced intelligence.\\n\r\nModest but brilliant!",

In each episode Watashi, our dear narrator/main character, chooses a different school club, ultimately meeting the same people in varying circumstances. It may sound very repetitive for some, but each scenario is fun and unique enough to stand on its own.\r\n  YojouhanShinwa Taikei also deals with the timeless themes of angst, apathy, and the general hopelessness that plagues many college-bound youth, although the demographic is leaning towards Japanese student society.\\n\r\n  Another thing that should be mentioned is YST's extremely fast pace both in speech and direction and the massive amounts of dense exposition thrust onto the viewer at all angels. The anime is only eleven episodes long but at a slower pace it could easily become a 2-cour show. However, the fast pace does a great job reflecting the hectic college lifestyle and holds firm to the idea that time flies when you're having fun.\\n\r\n~Characters:\\n\r\n  The main character Watashi, which translates into \"I\", acts as the narrator, which drives the perspective of the anime. He is sassy and sex crazed but also deeply humble, proud, and innocent young man. He is someone anyone will relate to somehow. Probably that was the reason to not give him a real name, so the audience could relate more.\\n\r\n  The other characters are equally delightful in their depictions, which begin archetypical and seemingly one-dimensional. Watashi provides us alternate looks at these characters, with each episode giving us more information about these characters. The development of supporting characters come naturally, and their presence in the story support Watashi\u2019s characterization.\\n\r\n  Talking about characters, I want to mention the great job that Voice Actors did. Main cast includes such names as Yoshino Hiroyuki (Ozu), Asanuma Shintaro (Watashi) and Sakamoto Maaya (Akashi). Of particular note is Shintaro Asanuma, who has lines that require him to speak a mile a minute. But he managed to deliver his lines and character well without a hitch, which was a nice surprise for me. \\n\r\n~Art:\\n\r\nI think this is one of the strongest sides of this show. Each frame of YST is pure art. There's simply not much else to say about it. Unique, imaginative, it reflects the mood of each scene perfectly. \\n\r\n~Sound:\\n\r\n  Opening and ending fit the show so well, that you can say they become the part of each episode. So I would recommend not skipping OP or ED in order to get the most enjoyment out of the episodes.\\n\r\n  OST is done by Oshima Michiru, woman know for her soundtracks for such titles as FMA, Hal, Sakasama no Patema and etc. \\n\r\n   Soundtrack blends in well with the overall setting and art style, being simple yet beautiful.\\n\r\n~Summary:\\n\r\n   In conclusion I would like to say that this anime was directed by Yuasa Masaaki, probably one of the most \"hipster\" directors out there. His other works include Kaiba, Kemonozume, Ping Pong The Animation. But Yuasa's directorial and artistic touch is exactly what makes this \"boring\" at first glance story and concept a true masterpiece.\\n\r\n  I would recommend this anime to everyone and anyone. Only 10 episodes were enough for me to add this anime to my favourites. And it took 11 episodes to give this anime a solid 10.",

            "content": "I have never written a review for an anime before, but seeing as there was no review that really encapsulated how I felt about the show I\u2019d like to put in my two cents. I always like it when I find someone that feels the same way about a show, especially when its relatively over hyped. If you want to know about the story check out the synopsis above. I just want to give my opinion on the story.\r\nI just finished this anime and while I found it entertaining, I would say it is over hyped. This story has been done dozens of times andit felt like they tried really hard to cover this up by changing the delivery of the story. How many shows or movies have a person reliving their days until they do the right thing? Dozens, millions, idk, prolly not that many, maybe actually. It just didn't seem new to me, and seemed predictable. Even though I like this story type lol. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good, but I didn't fall in love with them. After watching so much anime, they just seem like average characters. Nothing particularly stood out to me that made them memorable. Maybe the guy that\u2019s into the doll, but like who cares. Anime gets weird sometimes. No shocker. The more I think about them the more I dislike them actually. They all seemed to fit into their roles really well but that's about it. Very two dimensional, not much character development. Especially since you see them over and over again in the same situations. The only character that seemed to change over the series other than the main character was Ozu, who you find in the end has different long term goals than expected. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good, but I didn\u2019t fall in love with it. It was cool and a nice change of pace, but it just didn't really go all the way with me. I\u2019m not sure why but I personally think a good example of animation that trying to be trendy and does it much better would be Mob Psycho 100, the Monogatari series and Kill La Kill. I know the styles in these shows are different from T-Galaxy, but they both break away from the general animation styles and I prefer the way they did it to Tatami Galaxy. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good. I really like the outro for the first ten episodes. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the best episodes are the last two. The show does do a good job with closure and has a satisfying ending, but the episodes leading up to it just seem frustrating. I would probably say watch this show if you have nothing else to watch or you feel like a change of pace, but you prolly wouldn't be missing out on too much if you didn't watch it. Overall I liked the message, but again, it just felt anti-climactic and non-arousing. I\u2019m not sure if its because I have watched too much material or what but this one raised no emotional connection. ZERO. I actually don\u2019t think I laughed/cried once throughout the show. It just wasn\u2019t stimulating. Overall I thought it was good, but nothing crazy or outstanding. I just don't understand why people are giving it tens.    \\n",

It is the epitome of what anime should strive to be and breaks away from the norms of most anime being released these days. If you came here expecting a straight-forward, linear show, with lots of action scenes and crazy superpowers, sadly, this anime is exactly the opposite and may not be for you.\r\nHowever, if you enjoy amazingly written dialogue, a unique set of characters, beautiful art, a story that tests your mental capabilities and something that truly isn't alike anything you've seen before; look no further, The TatamiGalaxy is the perfect anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nLet me say this, the less you know going into The Tatami Galaxy, the greater your watching experience will be. My advice to you, just watch it, if what I said prior appeals to you, then I assure you that you will fall in love with The Tatami Galaxy. While I did love this show and without a doubt, believe that it is deserving of a 10, I will admit that this anime is not for everyone. If you're an avid fan of shounens and don't enjoy heavy dialogue such as the Monogatari Series, this may not be the show for you, however, I would still recommend you give it a try.",

            "content": "My early impressions of the very first episode were anything but great. Unusual art style, questionable character designs (in the form of a freaking huge chin guy and a demon who looks like he's dying from some incurable disease) and lightning fast line delivery. I honestly thought MAL trolled me into watching something horribly bad, but I know not to judge an anime based on its literal first five minutes, so I kept going. Let's just say I had a good laugh.\r\nThe story follows college student Watashi, whose name literally translates to \"Me\". He wants to live a \"rose colored campus life\" and get abeautiful \"raven-haired maiden\" as a girlfriend. He's worried about wasting his life away and thus always puts all of his time and energy into one or two things, expecting a big payoff of some sorts. He's always looking to take a shortcut, because he sadly fails to understand that cutting too many corners never works out in the long run.\\n\\n\r\n\"Humans were meant to work and sweat for their money after all. Those that try to get rich quick or live at the expense of others all get divine retribution somewhere along the way.\" ~ Jet Black\\n\\n\r\nThere's also this girl he never dares to ask out, Akashi. She's not easily approachable, but lowers her guard when around Watashi. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, he joins the tennis circle expecting to obtain his heart's desires, but fails miserably. And that's where the demon, Ozu, introduces himself as his compatriot. Watashi doesn't have a good feeling about him, but Ozu manages to convince him to join in on his fun and become his accomplice. Both of them work together to shatter the love of happy couples. Things eventually turn for the worse and time rewinds itself, which happens quite often in this show.\\n\\n\r\nOzu is a devilish prankster, as his favorite pastime is causing others mischief and his primary target is none other than Watashi. Unlike Watashi, he's very active and invests his time and effort into different schemes. I like his relationship with the main character, as I find it to be interesting. Watashi loves to rant about how much he despises Ozu, but if he's that horrible of a person, then why does he hang out with him? The answer's quite simple, really. He enjoys his company, but never dares to admit it. He loves \"wasting his life\" with him. They are both destined for each other. They are connected by the \"black thread of fate\", as Ozu himself puts it. \\n\\n\r\nThere's something everyone in the world, including myself, is guilty of. Getting the wrong impression of someone. It's easy for us to get the wrong impression of others and vice versa. I can't recall the number of times I was accused of being a suck up who thinks he's smarter than everyone else. We judge others based on a very limited perspective, when there's clearly more to them than that. Books, TV shows and movies also often present us with a very limited perspective. I really dislike it when fictional characters are portrayed as jerks and that's all there is to them, like the overused and annoying jock stereotype. We always see such characters behaving like jerks, thus they're simply jerks. Nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I was pleased to find that The Tatami Galaxy allows the viewer to see its characters from a multidimensional perspective. All of a sudden, douche bags and downright rotten people seem much more likeable than before. They might have weird obsessions and fetishes, but that's not what defines them as a person. Ozu in particular turned out quite well, but you'll have to watch the show to get what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout my life, I had always wondered how things would have turned out had I made different choices. Had I invested my time and energy into different things. Had I chosen to associate myself with different people. Maybe, just maybe, I would have lived a happier and more fulfilling life, had I obtained a second chance. I had put that kind of thinking behind me quite some time ago. I now see that a second chance isn't guaranteed to change anything for the better. Hell, not even a million second chances aren't guaranteed to improve anything. It's best for people to just accept the choices they've made and not see everything they ever did as a waste of time and effort.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to enjoyment, the speed of which voice actors delivered their lines somewhat impaired it for me, but it's still good enjoyment. Some episodes are pretty weird, but they fit the anime quite well, considering it's a pretty weird anime.\\n\\n\r\n~ Overall, The Tatami Galaxy turned out to be a very good experience.",

I wouldn't want to disrespect this work of art by putting it into a line with all the other ones.. The Tatami Galaxy is not just another anime. It is a truly special experience which I got many genuine laughters out of, though I admit that it took me about an episode to get used to this very unique style of drawing. Not a single character, storyline or second is wasted. Every sequence serves a purpose, whether it's about making the protagonists circumstances evermore ridiculous or just to get an important pointacross. I enjoyed this one thoroughly, and so will you, if you choose to jump into it without any prejudices, giving the odd story and unique style a chance. \\n\r\nIt would be a shame if I failed to mention the fabulous soundtracks. They truly hit the tone of this distinct anime, and the ED is a (pardon the caps) \\n\r\nCERTIFIED BANGER!\\n\r\nSo, if my point hasn't gotten across yet, which I highly doubt, I'd like to conclude by saying that this one's worth saving for dull times, because\\n\r\n\"The Tatami Galaxy\".. \\n\r\n                                 ... lightens ones mood greatly ...\\n\r\n                                 ... and inspires with it's uniquity!",

            "content": "What does it mean to live ? Do you have a proper image in your mind that drives you to live in a certain way ? What's the certainty that you will be able to live that way ? Will you actually be pleased if you manage everything you ever wanted ? Are you sure you won't feel emptiness ?Do you ever consider how much worse your life could've been ? Do you blame others for things not going your way ? Do you take responsibilty for your own action ? Are you sure there is nothing left for you if things don't go theway you want ? Tatami Galaxy is probably a masterpiece that can deal with all that in just 11 episodes and make you question yourself like never before . Its plot is intended to be very unique and educational at the same time . It has a strong narrative that allows it to be one of the strongest psychological anime to be ever made . \\n\\n\r\nTatami Galaxy deals with an unnamed protagonist people refer to as 'Watashi'(I in japanese ) because since the show is built around him narrating his feelings we never get to know his name . The strength of the show also lies here . Watashi narrating his own thoughts allows us to reach deep into his psychology . In just 11 episodes the show delivers a strong message to the viewers without really heading into an edgy approach . The show is simple and yet unique . The protagonist goes through the  results of the different choices in different episodes in loops in his attempt to find his desired way of life . However each time he finds that things did not the go the way he wanted . Leading him to question what the correct choice might be and trying them out in the following episodes. The self conflict of morality Watashi goes through has an enjoyable representation that will ease your head and make you relate without having you stress for it . Him questioning his decisions is basically all of us questioning ourself in our everyday life. Its true that choices can make a big difference in our life . The anime shows that pretty beautifully as well but what truly stands out is the self realization Watashi goes through in the final 2 and a half episodes that makes you conscious of how you should view life moving forward . The show is artistic  , simplistic and delivers the strongest of punches in the some of the most hilarious yet moving manner . \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : As I mentioned before the show focuses on the psychology of the main character in a unique style which wouldn't require the proper development of other characters . Not saying other characters aren't important. They play a vital role in establishing the show and cohesively make the show as good as it is . They have strong purposes and fit in the narrative as a role to build the main character . With that being said the main character ends up being the one of the most developed characters you will find in television so you know the cast did their job right .\\n\\n\r\nSound : For the people who find this important , you won't be disappointment . The show has pretty good opening and ending with strong symblism . What more could you want . \\n\\n\r\nArt ; The art is unique and whether someone likes it will be very subjective . I had a few problems in the start but once I got used to it , it seemed beautiful . The art in the final few episodes is surreal to say the least . One more important aspect of the art is it never really takes away the focus from the narrative . Its not too flashy and allows you to focus on the on going content in front of you which I also considered to be an important concept of the show . Now for some more questions to clarify what I am trying to say -\\n\\n\r\nHow do you want your message to be delivered ? Do you create a moving story and touches the audience to do it ? That can work but there's a chance the audience will be distracted by the happenings of the show . They would be too focused on the plot and might miss the teachings of the story . The same thing can be said for a really enjoyable thriller . More importantly how do you make the viewer vulnerable to the messages.  We often do not appreciated being corrected . A parent telling a child to fix a certain characteristic will often make it hard for the child to fix it simply because of the natural human behaviour of standing up for his own way of thinking and wanting to view things differently . South park is another show I really like because of their attempt to make the audience vulnerable before delivering their message . South park turns everything into a joke and delivers their message through satire . Although I may not agree with all the messages , it can not be denied how satire is a strong medium to deliver messages because it has the strength to open the mind of a viewer very easily .\\n\\n\r\nNow going back to what I was saying because of art style in The Tatami Galaxy everything crazy in the show feels easier to accept . We don't get hard feelings while watching the show ( unless its not your type in which case you will drop it anyway ) which makes us vulnurable to the teachings that come along with the show . \\n\\n\r\nOther than the main lesson of the show each episodes contains various different relatable self realizations we go through in real life  . So many in fact that it is hard to keep account of them . This is pretty much the only thing in the show that is hard to grasp . So if you think this is another mindfuck you are very wrong . What further boosts the delivery is the psychology used to deliver the content . In early show you will think this show is trying to tell us 'x' . Midway in the show you will realize it is questioning 'x' and finally when the show ends you will find a strong conclusion in 'y' . So by any chance the viewer is a believer in x , the show makes him/her realize that the writer is aware of his thought process and he has been through that stage so whatever the writer says in the end becomes easier to accept . The symbolism used throughout the show will make you appreciate the genius behing creating this show in the first place . \\n\\n\r\nConclusion : To share my own personal experience I thought a few episodes were weak compared to the others . But to create a cohesive show those weak and lesser enjoyable episodes were very necessary to show us more possible directions . Episode 4 was perhaps the weakest episode in the show in my opinion where I wanted to drop the show ( I continued because I loved Ping pong the animation , so I believed in Masaaki Yuasa ) So if you feel bored early on do not drop it.  Trust me it will be worth it once you finish the show . This is a show everyone can watch and enjoy . This can potentially change you as a person and will have you appreciate the creative genius for sure .\\n",

            "content": "We have all wondered about the possibility of a different outcome in our lives if another path had been chosen in the past. Our main character, Watashi feels the same way as he longs for the \u2018rose colored campus life\u2019 or a \u2018raven-haired maiden\u2019 none of which he possesses and so we embark on a journey of the many lives of Watashi as he struggles for the vague idea of what he thinks is happiness.\r\nMy attention had been gripped very tightly from the beginning due to the fast paced dialogue although at first it was a nuisance I was slowly able to appreciate the elementand texture it added to the anime. Getting into this anime I was very skeptical of it as I feared that the repetition of it would be its doom. However I couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Although this might seem like the case in the beginning, every episode is brilliantly layered and what appears to be the main character using a reset button to come to the same conclusion every time is actually utilized in a magnificent way. \\n\r\nIn the second half the the pieces of the puzzle slowly start to come together and all the episodes begin to intertwine and we begin to see more sides of a character in each episode or slowly being to realize the symbolism or significance things might have held, ones we might have looked past before but it is nearly impossible to escape the realization of what they represent. The castella, the mochigum, the book Higuchi took forever to return, the ramen, the 4.5 tatami room.\\n\r\nI could go on and on and even though reading this you probably think I have given away everything and spoiled it for you, I have not. That is how incredible this anime is. Just when you think you have everyone\u2019s motives or where this story is headed figured out, it throws something at you that completely changes what you had in mind. That is one of the greatest things about it, it never lets the viewer rest, it forces you to think harder and harder about what everything could mean, what conclusion it could come to. It experiments with Watashi\u2019s psychological state in such depth that sometimes it feels like simple problems of a college kid and his life but at others it\u2019s an unsolvable maze which has you perplexed trying to figure it out. My never ending praise for this anime might seem exaggerated but I am overwhelmed with emotions after watching it.\\n\\n\r\nUpon entering this show you will also notice that the animation and art is uniquely strange to ones usually seen in anime and they were a huge contribution to making this show stand out. The music too was glorious. The opening is partly why I kept coming back to this anime with incomprehensible amounts of excitement. The quirkiness of the characters and the unfortunate failures of Watashi would flash through my head and I wouldn\u2019t be able to help but smile when listening to it. The ending song was nice too. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a glorious ride and I command you to watch this anime or you shall be banished to a dungeon where all you get to eat is castella and fish burgers for an eternity.",

As many of you, I was interested to watch the show for the variety of artistic styles that it has. And now that I saw it all I can confidently say it's artistically beautifully done, but it also overshadows other aspects of the show.\r\nInitially, the story is confusing and the show gets a little heavy to see, but eventually you will realize it's simpler than it seems. There are constant introspective dialogues of the protagonist, the context in which the story unfolds is practicallythe same in almost every episode and it\u2019s also full of symbolism and literary references (Metamorphosis, I'm looking at you) but at the end of the day all turns out to be a compendium of experiences because of the different decisions that the protagonist makes to the restart his university life when he goes back in time. The set is coherent, but pales in comparison to other aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are charming in all the sense of the word. Each one has a distinct personality and almost all develop a backstory. However, the show focus too much on the protagonist who is clearly the most annoying character in the whole repertoire (Come on, it takes the whole show to him to realize the interesting life he always had) and leaves aside to interesting characters like Akashi. It makes a bit difficult to connect with all of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe show excels on technical aspects. The art is gorgeous, full of details and the use of the color palette is very careful while the animation is fluid. The sound section shines through all the show, both the rockish OP and the hypnotizing ED are memorable and the instrumental tracks sound organic and suit the show. The voice actors did a great job too, highlighting to Shintaro with his narration of supersonic speed.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is one of those animes not so easy to watch, but the overall experience is satisfying and it's a total delight both visually and audibly although the story may not be up to par. \\n",

In every episode a different part of the \"rose colored university life \" is criticized, the main complaints are the lack of indivuality, the struggle for popularity and the unconfrontational way of life.\r\nEveryday events are exaggerated to show how deeply flawed the way of thinking the public has. Problems are ignored, because nobody wants to step out of line. People are excluded, because nobody wants to confront them. It is better to be conform, even when everyone is doing it wrong, because to be different is the risky.\r\nOur protagonist hates those ideas. He tries to improve thesituation. Even though he tries his best, for better or for worse, he will always be punished for trying something different. \\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle repesents the message of the show. Its outstanding, almost delving into experimental animation, tatami galaxy is showing of some unconventional art. Completely branching of the trend of perfect digital animation, the series tries to be different. Embracing individuality even when it comes with imperfections.",

This is the kind of anime that will force you to think and view the story, characters in a deeper outlook.  The artwork for this anime is bizarre and unique, a counterpart of it's art would be the Monogatari series.  \r\nThe anime starts off rather very confusing. Throughout this show the name of our mc is not released to the viewers.  It drops us off in the middle of a school environment and forthe first to middle half of the show characters are introduced to us and the we start to gain a liking for our unlucky mc.  Some characters, like ozu for example, are an embodiment of some of the mc's problems and personal emotions.  \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of every episode time resets and in the next episode the mc will be just where the last episode started.  There he will repeat the same actions, but will make different choices that greatly affect the characters our mc comes into conflict with and the little situations and problems that pile up on our mc.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the end of the show approaches, the mc experiences a much more \"out worldly\" problem that changes him greatly and let him embrace some of his personal aspects and flaws.  And yes, if you're wondering if there is romance this show gives us a very satisfying romantic conclusion by the end.  By accepting everything about himself, the mc realizes opportunities that were always in front of him for many episodes and takes them.  This anime has a very satisfying ending and is definitely worth the watch. \\n\\n\r\nSo my verdict.  Why are you still here reading this?  Watch it now and you'll understand a lot more from just reading this review.  I guarantee that the Tatami Galaxy will have you satisfied by the end.\\n",

After all, what does giving No Game No Life a 7 say about you? You think a pretty good anime is pretty good. What does giving Midori a 1 say about you? You hate trashy garbage that everyone hates. 10's though\u202610's come with baggage. By your 10's shall you be judged.\r\nFor example, this is a review of The Tatami Galaxy. I have deemed it worthy of a 10. I watched it and loved it. Then Iwaited a year and I watched it again. Then I clicked the 10 in the ratings area of my list. I have declared that in my opinion The Tatami Galaxy is a perfect anime. And as far as surreal time-loop comedies go it is.\\n\\n\r\nNow you can look at my list, sort my anime by highest to lowest, and you\u2019ll see Tatami Galaxy sitting there at the top. You\u2019ll think \u201cugh, this idiot is a total hipster\u201d. You\u2019ll think \u201cseriously? People actually like that show?\u201d. But hopefully you\u2019ll think \u201chmmm, maybe I should watch that.\u201d Because my god is The Tatami Galaxy a great show. It accomplishes what all anime should but so few can: memorable art design; lovable characters; fantastic soundtrack; a cohesive story with *gasp* an ending; and a uniquely Japanese aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nSo check it out! I don\u2019t throw 10's around lightly. Love it or hate it, it\u2019s going to be a trip either way.\\n",

            "content": "Tatami Galaxy review\r\nLife is just a abbreviation of the sum of choices we make .\r\nStory 10/10\r\nHave you ever thought about the choices that you have made ? I am pretty sure everyone has thought about that once in their life time and questioned themselves :\u201dDid I do the right thing ? Could I have done better if I did that ? Why didn\u2019t I do that in the first place? etc\u201d. \r\nThe story in this show focuses on those choices and with the help of our protagonist \u201cWatashi\u201d who experiences those choices himself throughout the entire show. Throughout the development of the story we cansee how different the life of \u201cWatashi\u201d is based on the choices he made and the people he met and the influence those people had on him during his first year as a university student.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the anime is to show how different our lives can be due to a choice and for \u201cWatashi\u201d that choice represents joining a club. At first glance how can joining the Tennis club, the Cinema club, English club, can change our lives completely and have a impact on our normal daily life. Well that choice turned the life of our main character into \u201ca rose-colored campus life\u201d or a mess as he admits it.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story develops we are introduced to the many \u201cdesires\u201d we have as a university student , we want to be popular , we want to have a cute girlfriend which we can share our thoughts and opinions, we want to have a best friend to who we can laugh and cry together in good or bad times, to be acknowledged by our favorite teacher and many stuff we want to do during those years. To sum up what I said the show puts in the spotlight the choices we make and won\u2019t have any regret after our life as a university student is over and we go into the cruel and yet merciful society as a individual.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told from the perspective of our protagonist \u201cWatashi\u201d and it\u2019s a unique one too we can think of it as a jigsaw puzzle made of 11 episodes and each episode is a piece of the puzzle who is needed to finish it. After we finish the puzzle we are rewarded with the wonderful picture that those pieces created and stunned by the impact of that jigsaw puzzle who will remain memorable in our minds for a long time.The slow pace in the beginning and the repetitive scenes are there with a purpose and meant to get us to know the characters reactions in different situations , habits, manners, what they like or dislike , and after that everything is connected like I said forming a wonderful jigsaw puzzle image.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nWe have a diversity of characters and the show manages to evidentiate every character in each episode.The way those characters interact with each other influence the decisions \u201cWatashi\u201d makes directly or indirectly. Also the characters give a purpose and meaning to the story told from \u201cWatashi\u201d\u2019s perspective making it more interesting and adding a tone of maturity and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nWatashi is your typical university student who hates working and likes shortcuts and can be considered lazy.He is lazy because he doesn\u2019t put effort in other stuff other than his hobbies and let\u2019s be honest we all do that don\u2019t we?.\\n\\n\r\nOzu is our antagonist most of the time and the only friend \u201cWatashi\u201d has. He is the \u201crotten scroundel\u201d who always leads \u201cwatashi\u201d to astray and ends up profiting off of it.He hates vegetables too.\\n\\n\r\nAkashi is the girl which \u201cWatashi\u201d has a interest in , she is bluntly cold to others around her and loathes moths. Also this evidentiate the fact that she is a serious person too and does her job well unlike watashi who likes to take shortcuts.She has a funny side too and that is shown to us from the dialogues scenes she has with Watashi.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are mentionable too we have the doll-fanatic Jougasaki who like to be in the spotlight of attention all the time, the drunk Hanuki who likes to speak broken English and to lick the friends faces when she is drunk this happens only if that friend reached a certain level, the master higuchi who is a 8th year old graduate and his dream is to travel around the world. Also he is lazy and likes to take his time reading books which he never returns them on time.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is well done for all of them but Watashi gets a insane development. Every character interaction and reaction influence \u201cwatashi\u201d and his choices leading him to some disaster events, or good events, every detail is not missed on the characters and its well crafted in this anime.Even if some minor characters were not that well presented that didnt affect the story at all or slowed the pace of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion those characters portray real life students and how they interact with each other adding a tone of maturity and realism to this show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 10/10\\n\r\nUnique art style which captivates the viewer from the first episode until the last one.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 \\n\r\nThe opening song is lit , the sound and actions of characters fit perfectly with the situations they face.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nAs the university student myself I enjoyed this anime and I could relate to the characters, story and development of the plot in this anime. Also the comedy and suspense made me watch this anime in one day.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 \\n\r\nA perfect anime if I dare to say or a complete puzzle with each piece of it having a purpose and meaning for the story and characters.",

Diving into the 'slice of life' genre is among the most taxing tasks as it often requires someone who has understood life or at least some part of it and is able to embody that experience into something that speaks, both emotionally and physically, in simple terms yet having an effect on the viewer that is both profound and lasting, almost as if the viewer could almost adapt that experience and by the end of it, has the confidence to putforward a foot he has had since long, frozen in icicles of fear.\\n\\n\r\nA large chunk of creativity embeds the godlike direction. The walls of 4.5 Tatami rooms painted in artistic overtones. An opening song dipped in phrases of an echoing reality. The ending song calls dibs on three lovers, one non existent, one inanimate and the last showing affection only when drunk. A life of countless parallels but haunted by an ineluctable conclusion, Yuasa wraps a heartfelt message in endless portraits of abstraction revolving episode by episode and ceasing only on the viewer's signature. The Tatami Galaxy is the near perfect thematic fable, purposefully and intellectually out of phase while propelling projectiles on weeds that try to compromise its creativity.",

I felt like this specific anime deserved a great rating and a review because it had left so much on me.\r\nIt definitely deserves it.\r\nYojouhan Shinwa Taikei is an short anime about a guy named Watashi, a lonely college boy who desperately wants to find a \"rose-colored college life\", and to find true lovealong with it, but doesn\u00b4t succeed because of the tricks and obstacles that appear on his way, caused by him joining a club at the beginning of the year, and a devilish-looking guy named Ozu, who is tied to him \"by the dark thread of destiny\", as he says.\\n\\n\r\nOne day, he has the chance to go back 2 years in time to try to reach his fantasy life again, and there ends the 1st episode without trying to spoil anything else.\\n\\n\r\nWatch the anime before reading a review of it. Judge by your own criteria.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn\u00b4t long, and it\u00b4ll probably entertain you enugh for you to finish it quickly. For real. It is one of the best short ones, and my personal favorite for certain reasons which I will point out here.\\n\\n\r\nWhy watch it?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story is a metaphor for making choices.\\n\\n\r\nEvery step we make, breath we take, food we eat, friends we hang out with, even our deepest hopes and wishes, are choices. If we want to reach those goals, we can, but it will probably involve a lot of suffering and sleepless nights in order to reach it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, if one day you reach it, will it even be worth it? Or was it just another shallow desire made up by us to satisfy our egocentric hearts? Will it be worth all the pain you experimented, and even the damage it inflicted on others?\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy takes this idea and uses it in its own favor by presenting us an impossible situation, going back in time to change your future, and making Watashi decide what he wants to do with his life. What club to join, people to associate with; to have a different story than before, but with his mind-goal always set on reaching an impossible desire: his \"rose-colored college life\".\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, it really makes you reflect on what is the overall simplicity and connection between making choices, and all of the different and apparent never-ending decisions that can be made by a single person, no matter how lonely, unappealing, and weird they might appear.\\n\\n\r\nEverybody has a faucet they show to the world, and a million more that they don\u00b4t.\\n\\n\r\nI fell in love with this easy-to-follow yet incredibly entertaining story, mainly because of this metaphor. It is amazing how an 11 ep series can say so much without actually saying anything.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful in every way. A lot of anime artists prefer using complicated and super-detailed characters by adding an infinite amount of shades and colors to their designs, but this one does it WAY different. And I love it because of that.\\n\\n\r\n\"Beauty in simplicity\" sums it up pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nRooms made up of just 2 shades of yellow, characters with completely white skin, and simple pastel colors are used frequently through out the whole series, but the great animation combines all of these to make the look like they had just the right amount of details to actually get you \"in the mood\" of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime oficially converts me into a follower of the minimalistically-drawn animations, which make you see the beauty of things without needing millions of details.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nWatashi is literally me. Probably that\u00b4s why I liked this so much. I felt so connected to him throughout the episodes, which showed him in his entirety, not just surface-leveled depth.\\n\\n\r\nBecause there aren\u00b4t a lot of characters, you can understand how the other one feels like, and what his hopes and ideas are, based on each of their stories. All of them have a role in the overall plot of the series, and I thinks that makes me love them even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest thing is that it was enjoyable until the end. I laughed in almost every episode, got thrilled at times, and even reflected on my own life!\\n\\n\r\nHope that more anime focuses on themes like these, and makes other people feel the same way as me.\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

And if there were an \"Originality\" category, this anime would have scored 100.\r\nThe story, idle and simplistic at first, turns out to be a masterpiece. It's that perfect mixture of simplicity, sophistication and silliness that made this story brilliantly outstanding. Rarely one comes across something this neat.\r\nThe characters, more like the recurring cast, are as likable as they can be. Much of the praise goes to the surprisingly nameless Protagonist and Ozu, but every other character is so quirky it's impossible not to like.\r\nTheenjoyment factor is consistently high. Even when the plot relies on repetition as a plot device, the slow but steady subtle development of the story makes it constantly amusing, with the last episodes kicking it a few notches higher.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art, ever so faithful to the wholeness of this masterpiece, can't be done better by any means. On the sound department there is stellar voice acting by the entire cast, the absolutely delicious ambient music, the over-the-top occasional \"serious\" melodies, and that haunting ED. A perfect delivery. Graphics-wise, saying it makes up 50% of this show's awesomeness won't be fair enough: the avant-gardish quirkiness with the occasional attention to details, the real-life footage, the character design, the scenery, the op-ed .. well, everything was made to be perfect, and it duly was.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, \"The Tatami Galaxy\" is one of the best works of animation there will ever be made.",

I have many favorites I would recommend, but Tatami Galaxy is the only show I believe EVERYONE should see. The show moves at a blistering speed and I would not fault anyone for having to pause ever so often to take in language and visual art, each frame of which, while not technically complex, is just dripping with flavor and life. If there is any crowd that I would say might connect with Tatami, it would beyoung adults who are either in school or just trying to decipher their role in life, but anyone who appreciates good storytelling is in for a treat.",

            "content": "A good anime creates a world that is vivid and enticing; one that lets the viewer forget about his or her struggles in the real world and vicariously live out a fantasy of great desires.\r\nA great anime confronts the problems and struggles of the real world and shows that not a single person on this planet of seven billion can escape from the emotions of being human. This is exactly what Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei or The Tatami Galaxy does best.\r\nStory: Contrary to the popular high-school setting that dominates the current anime landscape, Yojouhan chooses to explore the next stage in life\u2014college. No longer in thetransitory stage between child and adult, college marks the beginning of adulthood and as such, is filled with many ambitions and aspirations, but at the same time, anxiety and concern for what the future may hold. This anime explores a myriad of ideas stemming from the new-found freedom and self-expectation of becoming an adult, including feelings of inadequacy, the depth of friendship, and the importance of living life in the moment rather than in the \"what could have been\". The story follows Watashi, the main character, as he pursues various club activities at school in search of the \"rose-colored college life\" that he has always dreamed of.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is a little quirky, but nevertheless very well done. The colors are bright and vibrant and capture the atmosphere of the story perfectly. The features of the characters are not over-embellished but instead kept rather simple, allowing the viewer to focus on the character interactions and self-realizations.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Just like the art style, the music used throughout the anime and for the OP and ED fit the overall vibe perfectly. At times, it heightens the tension between characters and at others adds the cherry on top to the joy. At no point does the sound feel out of place, but instead, acts as an integral part that complements the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I believe that Madhouse did an excellent job with the character design and the unique personalities assigned to each individual. The main character, Watashi, is portrayed in a simple manner that is very relatable to. The lack of a real name for this main character and the use of Watashi, which means \"I\", adds to the ability of the viewer to imagine him or herself in the same position. The other two main characters, Akashi and Ozu, are both designed in a very unique way that does not fall victim to the classic character tropes. Rather than take the spotlight off of Watashi, the two other main characters complement him perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I had an absolute blast just sitting down and watching this anime in one go. The show uses an episodic and slightly repetitive framework to introduce an idea and nurture the development of the main character. This sets the groundwork for one of the best endings I have seen in anime. The last two episodes tie up the story perfectly and give a very unique portrayal of the journey within the self-conscious to find what the soul truly desires. The anime is littered with psychological ideas and symbolism that may slip by the viewer the first time watching, but offer levels of depth to the show that illustrate how much time Yuasa Masaaki and his team put into creating something brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "Critic\u2019s Log - September 30, 2015. Review #99: The Tatami Galaxy\r\nMasaaki Yuasa was born on March 16, 1965 in Fukuoka, Japan. He is an Anime Director that many consider to be unique in the Anime industry.  His style is unique indeed. He is known for titles such as Mind Game, Kemonozume, Kaiba, Ping Pong, and the anime I am reviewing. Sadly, almost all of Masaaki Yuasa\u2019s work are unlicensed in the United State, this one on the other hand did get licensed but not much has been done to it in terms of a home release in the U.S.\r\nHere is my review of TheTatami Galaxy!\\n\\n\\n\r\nA second year student from the Kyoto University finds himself entrapped amid an overabundance of unsatisfying possibilities to change his life. Accompanied by, his mischievous best friend Ozu, and Akashi, a firm engineering student, the nameless student and protagonist trudges through each path as he tries to grab the opportunity that seems to dangle right in front of his eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy or \u201cYoj\u014d-Han Shinwa Taikei\u201d (meaning \u201c4 \u00bd Tatami Mythological Chronicles\u201d) is a Madhouse production which means a high chance of Good Animation. The Tatami Galaxy is different than what you would expect from Madhouse. The animation is both simplistic and unorthdox in how it moves most of the time. There are also some shortcuts here and there but they are put to good use. There is also some live-action shots that are filtered to add to the artsy nature of The Tatami Galaxy. I am also aware that it is very colorful in its aesthetics and the use of color really does give greater emphasis to the show\u2019s substance. This series is both vibrant and melancholy with its artwork and it is at times a visual mindfuck. You know what? This should be expected from Masaaki Yuasa, As I write up this review, this is the only anime I have seen that is directed by Masaaki Yuasa and I am aware that this is not the only show with his own unique style. The anime that Masaaki Yuasa directed before The Tatami Galaxy was the 2008 anime Kaiba. I have not seen that series but I did see the opening and I after seeing the opening and doing my homework on some of Masaaki Yuasa\u2019s other work. I am certain that what The Tatami Galaxy shows from start to finish is another example that Masaaki Yuasa is a unique anime director. The style in The Tatami Galaxy does not show in Kaiba, or even his more recent work which is Ping Pong. Pretty much every Anime that Masaaki Yuasa directs has its own design. The Tatami Galaxy is colorful, unique, and artsy. It also can look sloppy and bizarre at times but it is intentional considering some of the things that occur in this show. The animation in a nutshell is \u201cStyle with Substance\u201d. The art direction is flawless.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music of The Tatami Galaxy has some great orchestral pieces and the person behind all this is Michiru Oshima who is greatly known for her work on FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST (the original anime). I loved the soundtrack to the original FMA series but if you ask me\u2026 The soundtrack to The Tatami Galaxy is my favorite when it comes to Michiru Oshima\u2019s work. The themes may not be as memorable as Fullmetal Alchemist but the sound and instruments in The Tatami Galaxy\u2019s soundtrack is far more fitting than what she used for Fullmetal Alchemist. The music in The Tatami Galaxy is both classy and beautiful. The Opening theme \u201cMaigoinu to Ame no Beat\" (The Beat of a Stray Puppy and the Rain) by Asian Kung Fu Generation is pretty groovy and I never skipped this opening. The opening is rather good for showing every character in the series that will have their purpose in the show. Another nice thing about the opening is how for almost a minute is that live-action effect that makes the show intriguing to look at. The Closing theme \"Kami-sama no Iut\u014dri\u201d (As God Dictates) is a catchy theme as well and even though the opening and closing theme are not on the same page as the soundtrack, they are still good themes that do compliment the series well. The soundtrack is good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOn the vocal department, No English Dub exists for this series and you know what? I am okay with that to be honest because the show starts by having the show\u2019s protagonist (who is unnamed) talking really fast. There would be no bloody way that an English Dub could replicate this in the same way. Shintaro Asanuma really does deserve props for having a unique performance. Even though half or most of his dialogue is narration, it is fitting considering that The Tatami Galaxy is all about its main protagonist. The voice stuck to me and I think it\u2019s a pretty good performance overall. Hiroyuki Yoshino as Ozu was great as well. Then there\u2019s Akashi played by Maaya Sakamoto. What can I say? I like her as a voice actress. As for The Tatami Galaxy, she\u2019s not bad in it. This anime also has Keiji Fujiwara who plays Higuchi and he is a voice actor that I like because he has a cool voice and even though Higuchi isn\u2019t a cool character, he still plays Higuchi well. Junichi Suwabe is also in here as Jougasaki. The voice is fitting. Then there\u2019s Nobuyuki Hiyama. He is really over-the-top but for good reason. The voice acting is superb in this series. Even if there was an English Dub, I think the original voices are fitting.\\n\\n\r\nWhen characters are concerned, The (Unnamed) Main Protagonist is the center focus of the series and his whole purpose of the series is finding this \u201crose-colored\u201d campus life and he wants to meet this raven-haired girl of his dreams. There is actually more to him but it requires me to go as deep as I am willing to go. He goes to different social circles to achieve what he is searching for. However, his opportunity is often right in front of him and he misses his opportunity and tries again with something else. Even though The Tatami Galaxy is not strictly a Slice-of-Life anime, this aspect of the series is actually quite relatable for the viewer to understand where the main protagonist is coming from. Ozu is\u2026 good for character study. I am afraid I can\u2019t delve too deep with him but he is a great character in contrast to the Main Protagonist. Akashi is a good character in the mix of characters in The Tatami Galaxy but I feel like she was sidelined in the middle of the series considering her role. Higuchi is nonchalantly amusing, I will leave it at that. Jougasaki is a douche, but not a bad character. He\u2019s great for comic relief. There are other characters in the show but I decided not to delve in anymore on the other characters since they play a part in later episodes, but I will say that each character has some significance to the plot, whether it be the big points of the Tatami Galaxy or the really small but ingenious hints that the show offers. The characters in The Tatami Galaxy are great and it sounds crazy as I say this considering the conditions of the plot of The Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story of The Tatami Galaxy is a rather fascinating topic. First, I would like to refer to the 2009 airing of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Somewhere in the middle of the airing came the infamous episodes known as \u201cEndless Eight\u201d. The Endless Eight was infamous for having the first part set things up but the following 7 parts repeated the same episode but with minor significant differences. The Endless Eight arc was so bad that even one of the staff apologized for it. The plot of The Tatami Galaxy has a similar approach but it's more like that movie Groundhog Day and none of the repeating bullshit like Haruhi Suzumiya\u2019s Endless Eight. Even though the plot resets itself with time loops, the scenarios do differ from episode to episode, and this series actually ties things together. I can\u2019t say why but some might be turned off by the time loops so I am at least hinting on what the show is like without going into much detail. Still, there are some moments that really make sticking to the series rewarding. I will say that I only had one issue with the series, The ending\u2026 I cannot say too much but even though the show was great up into the climax, the ending was rather odd and I wish there would have been more closure than how the whole series wrapped up. Even though the ending is odd, It is still worth seeing even if you do not understand it completely after the first viewing all the way through. It may require some repeated viewing but given the amount of episodes\u2026 I\u2019d say that isn\u2019t a difficult task to consider. The Tatami Galaxy is a unique and colorful experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is available by Funimation, however\u2026 This series is only available by the means of Streaming. The Tatami Galaxy to this day has not received an American Home Release and shame on them because I seriously would love to get my hands on a Blu-ray release of this anime. The Tatami Galaxy is available by Beez Entertainment if you reside in the U.K and if you live in Australia or New Zealand, it is available by Siren Visual.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The Tatami Galaxy is a very interesting show with a rather fascinating plot, a classy and beautiful soundtrack, interesting character insight, and skillful visual direction. This is the only series by Masaaki Yuasa that has gotten licensed in the U.S. which is a crying shame since I hear he\u2019s a pretty good director when it comes to Anime. If you have not seen any of his work, The Tatami Galaxy is not a bad place to start.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give The Tatami Galaxy a 9.6 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment\u2026",

            "content": "Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei aka The Tatami Galaxy is an unique and very interesting anime. It perfectly delivers a nice, useful message related to Buddhism, wrapped up in a campus romcom setting. The delivery of the message was nice and clean. This anime works with two themes that I find very amusing. The first one, the timeline concept is used well in this anime. It may not make sense from a scientific point of view, but that was never the point of this anime. Another theme, depression for failure in socialization, was also executed perfectly. I like both of the ideas, but never thought that theycould be used together, let alone colliding with the message it delivers. But, the anime pulled them together so well that I believe there cannot be a greater mixture. It made me feel like these themes were made for each other. And this job could not have been done better. Through this crazy, yet careful mixture, the anime delivers the world of the main character. The room and boarding house he lives in, the places he goes to, the ramen he eats, all these were magnificently fleshed out. It perfectly detailed the campus life setup. There was hardly anything missing. The whole setting was detailed through different timelines. But, then again, as an absurdic series, it has its own shortcomings. A lot of things make little sense. But, that's really not the point, as I've mentioned before. This anime has many hidden messages, symbolism, metaphors and references throughout the series, and they're perfectly presented, nicely merged with the story. The anime didn't just perfectly do what it's supposed to but also surpassed its limits.\\n\r\nThe same goes for its storyline. The amusing story though, wouldn't have been anything close to what it is, if it weren't for the excellent presentation. The unique narrative is so majestic that it turns something that are destined to be info dumps into an attractive part of the story. The story, by itself is just very good and really interesting. It is how the anime presented it, is what turned it into a nigh masterpiece storyline. The story telling method perfectly described anything or any place that were greatly detailed, in a short time and a fascinating manner. The story used the little threads of events, weaved them and ended up with a piece of brilliance. The anime ended in an extremely good way. Not only did it perfectly pulled out the smallest of details in the end, but also left a huge impact. The story of this anime couldn't have been better in any way.\\n\r\nThe characters were introduced excellently. They may seem slightly one dimensional at first, but as time passes, the flat characters turn out to get more and more real, relatable and more multidimensional. That, of course, is a part of the anime's objective. And I, the viewer started growing on these characters. The MC, who is addressed as \"Watashi\" (I/me/myself) or \"You\" (by others), is a very interesting character. His characteristics are very well fleshed out. And he had extremely good character development. The best thing about him though is relatability. If anyone claims that he didn't have a single common thing with him, I'd believe that he's lying. Though his actions may be a bit too exaggerated, that doesn't change the fact that he's one of the most human-like realistic and relatable characters in anime. He has problems in life and flaws as a human, and he suffers and gets depressed about it. The whole story is told from his perspective, so his personality is presented perfectly. The rest of the cast, although not as much as the MC, are well fleshed out as well. They weren't copious or bland in any way. The screentime distribution is great. The character interaction and relationships are wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals of this anime is very unique. It uses an abstract art style. I loved the minimalistic art, but sometimes they were a bit too experimental for me. The character design is excellent. The environment was well designed. The abstract use of colors was a cream for my eyes. The animation and filming are masterfully done, but similar to the art, it sometimes can be too experimental for me. But, this department did the best possible work for the anime. The sound system was really good. The OP is an enjoyable theme, which is meaningful as well. The ED was euphoric. I don't see/hear anything to complain about the environmental sounds. The background musics are fantastic and really goes well with the mood and flow of the story. The voice acting and narration is perfect and couldn't have been better. Overall, this anime has an excellent production value.\\n\\n\r\nSome might and do find it hard to follow for its high speed monologues, but that's what made this anime charming in my opinion. It was fun. it was heart warming. It had its lugubrious aspects. Overall, it was a really interesting experience. A highly entertaining show.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime overall is worth 9.15 out of 10, in my opinion and that's pretty close to a masterpiece. The anime is quite polarizing. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. Many might even hate it. Well, I'd suggest watching through the first two episodes as a trial, although the anime gets a lot better after the third episode. But, if you don't think this is cut out for you after two episodes, you might not find it very enjoyable, and you may drop it whenever you wish. After all, you don't look for fishes in trees.\\n\r\nIt's an excellent piece of artistic film. And it's worth rewatching many times. The entertainment or intriguing amusement doesn't cease even if it's a rewatch. In the end, I do call shit on it in different communities for fun, but hey! \"That's how I show my love\".",

            "content": "I just got through with this series and I can honestly say just by reading website descriptions and watching the first episode, I had no idea what was going to happen. A problem with most anime is that the storyline tends to follow a same set popular pattern more or less and ends up making the majority of anime similar or almost the same in my opinion. Because this is defined as a 'love' story, I was expecting you know, the typical shy/unknown boy beats the bad guys and ends up wooing the girl. \r\nWell, I was really wrong. \r\nStemming from this, let's first startwith first impressions.\\n\r\nThe art is AMAZING. I absolutely adore the style, and I love the use of a really flat, linear art style with strong color/pattern and even integration of real pictures/video as background or filler. It really helps the story define its self defined role of being more 'indie' or 'unique'? Nevertheless, it's amazing. Definitely reminds me of styles used in vintage manga/anime. But it's certainly a fresh take on it.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the music. I think the opening traditions with the rest of the episodes very well. Again, integration of drawings as well as real pictures/video. The music is also upbeat and not the typical music you would hear for this sort of thing. The ending is also very good. I love how the tatami's are transformed into cells and I feel this went amazingly with the last few episodes. (You'll understand once you finish it.) The music is refreshing and the transition from anime to ending is very good.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline. It, to me is definitely a fresh take on a typical plot. While watching the anime I realized that the main character is on a quest for love, but also on a quest to fulfill himself wholly and make purpose in his life. This, I feel, is extremely relatable to a large majority of people than the 'boy beats up bully and girl confesses to him' scenario. This to me is much stronger than a love story. With the constantly changing storyline and perspective, I definitely was on my toes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and the main characters interaction with them are very 'interesting' to say the least. I do often find myself confused by these interactions and scenarios but the ending clears a lot of that up for me. These are definitely 'strange' and memorable characters which has me questioning-where is he and how the heck do you meet these people?!\\n\\n\r\nLastly, overall I would definitely suggest this if you are like me: you love 'indie' or interesting art in an anime (or just good art in general) , but you hate the typical plot line. It's also fairly short at 11 episodes and it's definitely a nice, short fun story to get into. \\n",

            "content": "Hello fellow Anime-fans ^^\r\nThis isn't as much a review as it is a comment on a specific complaint I always hear about Tatami Galaxy.\r\nFirstly, I personally really enjoyed The Tatami Galaxy. Personal enjoyment ideed is a very impactful factor on how someone rates something. Personal enjoyment however isn't the only factor that has to be considered while writing a review on something. Enjoyment is simply subjective. There just isn't any guarantee that other people feel the same about something you personally like.\r\nTherefore one has to find some sort of \"objective\" criterion that isn't bound to personal tastes.\r\nThis kind of quality is independent of subjective viewsand can be evaluated intersubjectively.\\n\r\nBut even then, the criteria for \"objective\" quality are never completly devoid of genre conventions, stylistic trends or other sorts of arbitrary elements. \\n\r\nEven technical details like how the visuals or the sound are produced are not purely measured in objective standarts, but are always  the object of individual preferences or production tends. Which is more important, visual direction or soundtrack? Character developement or worldbuilding? Counsciously or not, different aspects of how an Anime or every piece of handicraft is produced, presented or viewed are always prioritized differently depending on subjective intentions or intersubjective conventions.\\n\r\nHowever, I think it is possible to determine, whether a special point of criticism is justified or not.\\n\\n\r\nThat finally leads me to the point a want to discuss in this review. I want to dicuss, whether Tatami Galaxy is pretentious or not.\\n\r\nBeing pretentious is one of the most common accusations I hear in discussions about Anime. It's a knock-out argument you instantly hear every time an Anime differs from the norm in some sort. The Anime \"pretends to be more than it is in reality\". It \"tried to be intelectual, when it isn't\".\\n\r\nThere are some pretentious Anime for shure, but the one thing I never understood is, why people call Tatami Galaxy \"pretetious\".\\n\r\nFirstly the Art style: It is indeed quite different fro most seasonal shows nowadays. But being different isn't per se a reason to call something pretentious. In TTG's case, the unusual art style is in fact pretty usual for Yuasa Masaaki's works. Yuasa also worked on Ping pong the Animation, Kaiba, Mind Game and even several Crayon Shin-chan Movies among other things, always leaving at least races of his distinctive style.\\n\r\nBut style alone cannot be called pretentious, it's an artistic decision that sometimes fits an anime more, sometimes less. Calling Yuasa's style \"pretentious\" just because it is different means juding a book by it's cover and ignoring the fact that an art style is chosen to complement the story, not to just being different.\\n\r\nCalling the decision to use a certain style pretentious is a subjective assumption which implies that the production team deliberatly choses it to be an empty shell. It's a quite severe accusation that shouldn't just be based on one's subjective impression that something tries to be different just to be different. In fact, most shows that are different in style are different to achieve something and I think TTG is one of them.\\n\r\nThe visuals in TTG always complement the situation and are consistent in the sense of being clearly chosen to create some sort of atmosphere over the duration of the series. If you like this atmosphere or not isn't a criterion to accuse this decision as \"pretentious\". \\n\\n\r\nThe other aspect of TTG that's often being called pretentious is the story telling. I can understand that it is difficult to follow the fast paced dialogues sometimes. I also see that TTG is indeed a bit confusing at first - the real nature of it's plot is only revealed gradually and doesn't fully come together until the shows end, but that's deliberate. Not deliberate in the sense of \"they only wanted to make it complicated\", but delibarate in the sense of a story telling decision, which relies heavily on recurring motives throughout the story. \\n\r\nTTG is in fact your typical \"Groundhog day\"-style show, with the twist that with every iteration, the small details of the underlying plot come more and more together to form a coherent single entity. I personally really enjoyed especially this aspect of TTG. Aside from that, the main theme is just your run-of-the-mill coming-of-age romance story, the very opposite of pretentious. Speaking of the opposite of pretentious, TTG clearly does not \"pretend\" to accomplish anything with it's storytelling that it doesn't accomplish in the end. Every loose string of plot, every small recurring detail fits the grand scheme in the end. The accusation of being pretentious gives me the impression that most people who accuse TTG of being pretentious didn't watch the whole show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: Please go easy on me, I'm no native speaker ^^'\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!\r\nI think it's safe to assume that everyone here in the anime community has a favorite anime. And the beautiful thing about that is that even if two people have the same favorite anime, everyone has their own reasons for that particular show to be their favorite. Be it nostalgia, relatable characters, the way it was directed, or in my case, how it changed your life. As you can tell, that's what The Tatami Galaxy did for me. How? We'll get to that in a bit.\r\nStory: 9/10 Tne Tatami Galaxy follows an unnamed protagonist commonly referred to as Watashi, an incomingcollege student who wants to live the \"rose colored campus life.\" To do this, he joins certain student organizations and clubs and tries to find happiness and love through them. As he is walking home one night, he is told by a fortune teller, \"Opportunity is always dangling in front of your eyes.\" However, Watashi never reaches for it and at the end of each episode, time resets setting up the next scenario for Watashi in the following episode. Kind of confusing, but this will all make sense by the end of the review. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 This show is directed by Masaaki Yuasa, a man commonly known for his unique and stand alone art style and is animated by Madhouse, a studio never known to cut corners when it comes to animation, so needless to say, the show looks brilliant. The colors you'll see in this show are primarily black and white, but there are quite a few colorized objects as well. Not to mention the live action shots. While this is a major turnoff for some, I view it as more of an artistic style choice. Also worth mentioning is that each character is brimming with personality, with over exaggerated facial expressions and eating animations. All in all, the art in this show is perfect and really complements the style and message Yuasa was going for with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 Aside from the art style, another reason many people are turned off by this anime is that there is no dub and the dialogue goes by very fast, even for long time subtitle readers. However, in a few episodes, you should be able to get used to it, and once you do, you'll find that the voice actors did a brilliant job conveying the emotions and feelings of their respective characters. As for music, the opening song is one of my favorites in any anime is is constantly getting stuck in my head, it's just so dang catchy. In the department of sound effects, this anime hits it out of the ball park with that too. In order to enhance the narration, sound effects were added to bring simple dialogue to life. It doesn't even matter if you see the person or object that's making the noise, it really livens up the experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 The characters are what make this show for me. Everyone here has a purpose and contributes something to Watashi's life. We have his love interest Akashi, who is missing a toy keychain that Watashi has, Ozu, a weird looking man who acts like a rival to Watashi constantly stealing the fun from him, Ryoko, a dental hygienist who forms a close relationship with Watashi, hell, even an inflatable doll plays a key role in this show. Not a single character is forgettable in this anime. The cast is very diverse. In other words, each character has a unique trait about them that is actually explored very well. More shows and forms of entertainment in general should aspire to make their character as well as Tatami Galaxy made theirs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. Believe me, if I could rate this higher I would. My enjoyment for this show didn't come from me being entertained by it. No, my enjoyment came from the message it was sending, and the time that I watched it. Around this time, I was a senior in high school with about a month or two left before graduation. I had very few friends, had trouble talking with girls I had strong feelings for, and was too scared to take risks. I didn't feel like I was ready for the pressures of college at all. People were telling me time and time again to watch The Tatami Galaxy because it is a masterpiece of animation and is up there with the greatest anime of all time, so one day when I had nothing to do, I caved in and watched it, and I am SO glad that I did. Going back to the quote from the fortune teller, \"Opportunity is always dangling in front of your eyes.\" This anime's message is that if you feel like you're living down in the dumps or there's not enough fun in your life, you only have yourself to blame. You need to reach out for that opportunity and hold onto it for dear life. That is the key to living a fulfilling life. After watching this anime, I decided to reach out for opportunities more than ever before and never be afraid to take risks, and I'm living a hell of a lot better now because of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 Even if we put my personal connections aside, because in the end that means nothing, this is still a fantastic anime in every way. Memorable characters that serve a purpose, a very odd yet charming art style, great music, and a message that will speak to just about anyone, The Tatami Galaxy is a show that needs to be seen to be be believed. Allow me to end this review with a message to anyone getting ready for college or even the real world after college. If you feel like your life is boring or you feel like you don't know your place in the world, I IMPLORE YOU to watch this anime. Thank you for reading.",

            "content": "Bummer. One would say that 8 is a great score, but not for a show that was building up this \"you can just call me a masterpiece right now\" feeling from the beginning.\r\nSTORY 6/10\r\nThe concept of Tatami Galaxy can be very easily described in one sentence: Simple college-life story with complicated storytelling. The progression is somehow semi-episodic, each episode tackles one branch of the exact same time span (1st and 2nd year as a male college student trying to fully experience given environment while focusing on the possibility of romantic relationship instead of experiencing it directly) and the branches blend together chronologically from the narratorsperspective.\\n\r\nHowever, only episodes 1-9 follow this formula. They are very enjoyable and I would give them a masterpiece rating, if it wasn't for the conclusion. Everyone and their lame dog saw it coming, but they still invested 2 episodes into an absolutely pathetic struggle of the main character. This struggle was present for the entire duration of the show, why do they have to create so much lyrical bullshit to make a different and condensed version of an already apparent point while neglecting the development and significance of other characters? I mean, I get it, the whole show is focused on one egoistic bastard so we can relate to him properly with our similarly egoistic and pathetic lives, but that by itself is not enough to justify such an anticlimactic conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the show utilizes the maximum potential of the medium.\\n\\n\r\nART 10/10\\n\r\nThe mixture of real/realistic sceneries with the somewhat minimalistic art is gorgeous and contributes to the overall mood perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAmazing OP and ED themes, very elegant and fitting classical score.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are only very slightly but still interestingly developed (except for Ozu, dude is in MC's head complicated as f***), quite a shame that the storytelling didn't cover much of the character progression. It was especially disappointing to not see more of Akashi and Jougasaki.\\n\r\n(Side note: Hanuki Ryouko is the sexiest female anime character I've seen, by far)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, I had a blast watching the show, but the joy ended before the final sequence finished, which is, again, disappointing. I expected this to leave a firmer impression, but it lacked meaningful progression and a proper ending. Too much focus on the main character.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I think Tatami Galaxy is a great show, I would go as far as saying that in terms of actually being a piece of art in anime category, this is the best one, because it uses all the tools specifically available for this medium. However, the abstract description of ones mental state goes unnecessarily and ridiculously overboard in later episodes, which adds a slightly sour taste on top of the pleasant flavour of otherwise coherent content.",

            "content": "If you heard about this show before then you probably heard more about the mile a minute monologues delivered by the unnamed protagonist than anything else about it. Which is a shame even though this aspect of the series becomes a highlight once your brain is properly adjusted. Tatamy Galaxy has probably the best dialogues I've ever seen in a anime before and one of the best writing in general, add this up with the ingenious, flourishing and mind boggling direction by anime genius Yuasa Maasaki and you have one of the most creative and fulfilling experiences anime have to offer. It is really thatgood. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting might not be the most original, but the groundhog day college life-esque plot is really handled fantastically. You have this multitude of interesting characters, symbols and themes the run through the veins of the show for its entirety that never go to waste. Every little item presented here is utilized later on giving the episodic show a feeling of continuity that is really hard to achieve. Still, probably what satisfies me the most about it is how it manages to avoid pretentiousness. Although Yojouhan is deep and multilayered it never tries too hard to impress. It is ambitious, but always honest; it is clever, but never showy. It's just perfectly balanced.\\n\\n\r\nYou might think the ending is a bit cliched when you first see it, but when you stop to reflect on it you reach the conclusion that no show ever conveyed Carpe Diem so effectively, it is much more than a simple romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nAside from Monster I can't think of another show I watched that I don't have any problems with it (and yes I've seen Cowboy Bebop) but Tatami is probably a second one. \\n\\n\r\nIt's so weird how much you can relate to a MC that doen't even have a name, but now that I think about it, that's exactly the point.",

            "content": "(slight spoiler-y)\r\nOh-hoho. Now this was one hell of anime. I ain't kidding, man.\r\nNow before you go for this, I must clarify that this is an episodic anime which kind of follows the Endless eight formula of The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya without all the looped crap.\r\nOptimistic freshman starts college and is quite happy to do so as he has high expectations of bagging a huge gathering of friends and a beautiful raven-haired maiden. But then, Freshboy meets Ozu. Yes, Ozu. That despicable deviant of the highest of devious caliber who claims that he and Freshboy are linked by the black thread of fate. And so,the misadventures of not accomplishing any noteworthy begin by the, each, end of which Freshboy goes, \"What if...?\"\\n\r\nAnd then the cycle repeats.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an interesting show. The most interesting about it, to me, is the artwork and the animation. It's just so basic. But, it packs one hell of a punch. It has impact. It grabs your attention and gradually pulls you in. The same goes for the story.\\n\r\nEvery episode shows different 'What ifs?' with different characters and situations. Each episode softly clasps your hand and tries to reassure that you won't be bored. It's like they're whispering to you; showing you signs, pointing at things, lookie here and lookie there! They ask you to enjoy yourself and prepare for the conclusion. And the conclusion is absolutely worth it. By the end of the whole thing, you'll be clapping and might even giggle and mutter, \"Well shit.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this show themselves are 'stories', you could say. You get to see them from so many different angles that instead of a sheet of paper containing a character's story, you are presented with a 3D sphere of many sheets glued together showing you a living and breathing (and whacky) human. You'll instantly love them. Especially that Ozu.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP by Asian Kung-Fu Generation was pretty catchy. Was stuck in my head for quite a while. The ED is also good. Reminds me of the ED of Space Dandy (X Dimension or something t was called).\\n\\n\r\nShit's 10/10, yo. DEFINITELY recommend.\\n",

            "content": "I once went through a pretty severe existential crisis (who doesn't?).  I recall searching \"the meaning of life\" on Wikipedia, out of sheer desperation for some answers.  To my surprise, there was an extensive page cataloging various thoughts on the matter of existence, from Platonic to Utilitarian perspectives and everything in between.  It was then that I learned that the right answer to some questions is not a clear, black-and-white response, but the very fact that others are also asking the same questions.  Watching this anime reminded me of that fact of life.\r\nSTORY - 10\r\nThere are two types of narratives.There is the kind that throws the viewer right into the heat of progression from the start and always accelerate.   Death Note and Code Geass come to mind as anime that are excellent examples of such storytelling.  Then there is the style of storytelling that, while not necessarily boring, won't utter enthrall the viewer until the very end.  Tatami Galaxy is like that.  This kind of plot progression is useful if the ideas and themes being elucidated is more important than the plot itself, and, indeed, Tatami Galaxy is about much more than what actually happens to the protagonist.  The episodic storytelling is a brilliant framing device for exploring the protagonist from various angles.  If you've seen Picasso's cubist paintings, you'll know that the objects in his works often do not make visual sense at a glance, but if you look at the frame from multiple perspectives, you can discern features and relationships that are hidden in any single viewpoint.  The person's eyes are facing forward because they are meant to be seen from the front, and his nose is stuck grotesquely sideways because that is his nose when viewed from the side.  Tatami Galaxy's episodic storyline takes snapshots of the protagonist's life from various angles, subjecting him to different situational experiments, and, by the end of the show, gives the viewer a gestalt collage of his world, and, through that, our world.  It is the type of plot progression that will never bore you, tantalize you, and, by the time of the finale, blow your mind and flood it with understanding.\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\r\nTatami Galaxy is definitely art-house.  Metaphysical realism is achieved through the depth of character interactions, instead of visual realism.  The world of Tatami Galaxy is barely sane when the protagonist is (very seldomly) in a state of relative stability.  However, whenever drama engulfs him, the entire screen becomes submerged in a deluge of stylization, symbolism, surrealism, and utter psychedely.  This was actually a big dilemma for me because there is a great deal of rapid-fire dialogue that result in fast-shuffling walls of subtities for a non-Japanese speaker like me.  I found that I had to often hit the pause in order to read and comprehend all of the subtitles, so that I could fully appreciate the visuals without scrambling to speed-read the subtitles.  So worth it, since there is never a shortage of eyegasm on the screen, especially in lieu of the rich symbolism and integration with the dialogue.  If you enjoy the art-house style of anime such as Bakemonogatari and/or the rich symbolism of Neon Genesis Evangelion, you should be all over the art style of Tatami Galaxy.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 10\\n\r\nThe ED is fantastic.  It always (with an exception, but no spoilers) integrates fully with the ending moment of the episode itself, and is an addictive blast to listen to.  The voice acting and the sound design dance on the line between reality and psychedelic delusions, at times delivering crisp and believable sound effects that keep one's mind firmly anchored to the reality being portrayed on screen and, when appropriate, diving headlong into the waters of gratification, hubris, delusion, comic despair, and agitation that the protagonist is feeling at the time.  Since the character design is very stylized over all, it is their excellent voice acting that allows them to remain identifiable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 8\\n\r\nThe main character, who is not only the main character, but the being whose thoughts and experiences constitute the very reality of Tatami Galaxy, is one of my favorite anime character of all time.  The trials he faces and pores over are something everyone can identify with, and his struggles are portrayed in an extremely candid and believable manner.  Perhaps it was helped by the fact that I watched the show from a similar position as the protagonist, a college student, but the moments when the protagonist's inner thoughts seamlessly superimposed upon my most private and subjective thoughts were priceless.  Watashi (his name is never given, so the Japanese pronoun for \"I\" is used on the character page) IS Tatami Galaxy.  The main goal of the show is to dive into the mind and existence of Watashi, and what a wonderfully deep and interesting pool he is.\\n\r\nMy gripe is that other characters are not fleshed out as much as they could have been.  Sure, Watashi is the personification of the entire show, but the tight cast of eccentrics that constitute his entourage were so quirky and likable that I found myself wishing that they received some spotlight as well, instead of just being seen from the protagonist's perspective.  The demonic Ozu, with his mysterious background, Jougasaki, with his... Kaori, Higuchi, with his enlightened ways were all very engrossing characters who could each have had a show about himself.  So, in conclusion, the characters were so good and enjoyable that it was a pity they were only shown from the protagonist's eyes (though that in itself was brilliant).\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\\n\r\nA highly-subjective nine.  I'd have easily given the show a 10 over all, but I feel that each category, even the ones I had given 10 on, could be polished and trimmed out just a tad further.  The story was engrossing, but I wish there could have been a bit more content; I actually wish that they'd milk out this show the way other popular franchises get milked out (but perhaps not as much as Bleach, etc.).  The art was wonderfully quirky, but I wish they had gotten even crazier.  The sound was awesome, but I wish they could have said more stuff, played more sound effects.  In the end, I want more and more of this show.  My feelings upon watching the finale was comparable to that I felt upon watching the finale of NGE.  Brilliant and mind-blowing, but a tad premature, even just for my subjective thirst for more of this amazing show.  This is why I give the show a highly-subjective 9.  It was such a refreshing experience, and I felt that the creators could have decided to bring it to an end, even just one more episode later, after having developed it more.  You know, sometimes you'd be watching a show, and it suddenly hits you, 'this show has really hit its crux; it's about time it ended.'  And that applies not only to crappy shows that drag on from the beginning and make you wish it would end; every show, regardless of its quality has an appropriate ending point, and I just feel that Tatami Galaxy ended when it was at 99%, rather than the perfect 100%, at which point, I would have thought 'what a wonderful ride it was! now I can't wait to see what kind of ending the creators will top it with!'\\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this show for those who watch anime to blow off steam and get some pure entertainment out of it.  That's not in any way a bad thing, as I utterly enjoyed shows like TTGL for that very reason.  However, if you feel that you're up to some highly intelligent, fresh, mind-blowing journey into the vicarious psyche of an everydude, by all means, pick up Tatami Galaxy.  After you've seen that psychedelic clock rewind (you'll know if you watch) for a couple of times, you won't be able to wait to find out what delusion Watashi gets himself into in the next \"reset\" (again, it makes sense if you watch) and forget even to expect a linear storyline.",

            "content": "I came upon this show a few years ago after reading a short article in a very popular magazine. I finally finished watching it and thought I'd write a short review about it.\r\nStory:\r\nWe have an unnamed lead character whose life is in complete shambles, yet still believes that he can get himself in order. He gets the opportunity to do so at the end of each episode when it \"resets\" and he gets to reinvent himself. This reminded me of Bill Murray in \"Groundhog Day\", or if you'd like, how Kenny used to die in every episode of \"South Park\" and no one had anyrecollection of it in the following episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art style is quite different from what I'm used to, but great nonetheless. The characters and scenery aren't as detailed as most shows, but this helps with the humor and tone of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhile watching the first few episodes you might not see any development regarding the characters, but this changes towards the end. Everyone seems completely random with no particular purpose to serve, but you slowly begin to realize how they all help each other mature. You begin to love every character's quirk and even look forward to the next predicament they're faced with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis show might not be everyone's cup of tea. At first, the randomness of the story was a bit too much for me, but I'm glad I stuck with it. Everything ties together towards the end and you get to take your own life lesson from it. In my case, it's that in real life you won't get to re-live a moment and take a chance you passed up on. Do what makes you happy, no matter how boring or stupid it may seem to others.",

            "content": "I\u2019ll say it right off the bat, not everyone will like this show. It blasts you with rapid amounts of dialogue, the art direction is definitely bizarre, and it follows a formula for a majority of the series. But the dialogue is so eloquent, the art is so beautiful, and the formula always brings something new to the table. Simply put, this show is genius.\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nIn a nutshell, Tatami Galaxy uses a Groundhog Day-like scenario where our nameless protagonist (we\u2019ll just call him Watashi) joins a new club in each scenario to achieve the \u201crose-colored campus life\u201d and \u201craven-haired maiden\u201d (Admit it, we all wantedthis since High School). Sounds average, but trust me there\u2019s more to it. Admittedly, it may seem repetitive at times with a particular three parter explaining the situation at the beginning of every episode. However, this show knows how to give each episode its own purpose and identity and it never ceases to bore me. Also this anime is the hallmark for good, satisfying endings. The show did what is came for and never overstayed its welcome. There\u2019s a wonderful balance of heartfelt moments and comedy. And the comedy is actually funny as it's relatable and doesn\u2019t pander to typical anime chiches. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the most infamous part of the show, the crazy fast dialogue. This is not an easy show to watch since unless you have been watching tons of subs or are a fast reader, you will likely not keep up with the dialogue. I watched this on Hulu, so the 10 second rewind was a godsend. I can almost forgive this as the writing is really good, but having to rewind over  2 times because you couldn\u2019t understand said writing does take you out of the moment and is at worst, frustrating. Thankfully, the show slows down\u2026 sometimes. Keep in mind that this show is based on an actual novel, not a light novel or manga.\\n\\n\r\nBe on the lookout and pay attention, because Tatami Galaxy has some themes and lots of subtle metaphors throughout to emphasize said themes. Tatami Galaxy is like a short poem. With its small amount of episodes and massive amounts of text, one could over analyse what Tatami Galaxy is trying to say. And to be honest, its message is actually quite simple, relatable, and beautiful. For those who have seen the show, hopefully this show has reached out to you in some way, it sure did for me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nWatashi is nameless so that further cements him as our projection character. And he makes a truly great character at that. His cynical and narrow minded views on college are undeniably relatable and the choices he makes are justifiable and real. His development is very rewarding to see as well and the relationships with the various characters of the show feel believable, fun, and even heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the side characters, don\u2019t expect them to be realistic. They are unique, witty, and have traits that are thankfully less of anime stereotypes, but more of a overexaggerated symbol of the people we would typically see in our everyday lives. But just when you think you know them, there is simply more to them than you think. The best example being Ozu. He starts off as the bad influence character, but thanks to great writing, rather than an unlikable character meant to torture Watashi, he\u2019s fun to watch and later on someone you can grow attached to. Oh yeah, and show that can personify a guy\u2019s \u201cJohnny\u201d and make it over the top and funny without resorting to tired jokes always deserves the highest of praise. Well done Tatami Galaxy!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse combined with Yuasa\u2019s directorial efforts work wonders here. The art is just so imaginative and creative when it wants to be. The character designs are distinct, match with their unique personalities, and are appealing to look at (Can\u2019t say the same with Ping Pong, sadly). The animation is fluid and vibrant. The color palette is unique, detailed, and can emphasize the uplifting metaphors of coming of age to the more bleak nature of loneliness.\\n\\n\r\nOne style to take note of was the mix of real world footage with the animation. What should have been jarring is actually well blended and adds to the atmosphere of the room. I wish more shows these days could take more experimental styles like this than resort to poor use of CGI. Alright, sure you can find a couple of micro nitpicks here and there, but it's barely noticeable and doesn\u2019t detract too much from the experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is great. It has some well put live action foreshadowing and the song is quite catchy. Its a great fit for the show and the character cutouts were cool to look at (Was anyone thinking Paper Mario in this intro?). The ending is even better as I believe it's more in theme with the show. Each episode with the clock had a perfect transition to this ending. The moving squares in this ending surprisingly had some meaning to it and the singer\u2019s vocals are quiet, but at the same time powerful.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you intentionally pay attention to the music in the background, you likely won\u2019t notice the ost. And that's probably because of how well the music fits each scene. From the more comedic vibes to the soft yet natural piano, the ost for Tatami Galaxy works wonders here and can even be worth listening on its own. The voice acting is outstanding and you can tell that effort was put into it, especially for Watashi\u2019s character. I have utmost respect for anyone who can convey emotion while talking a 100 miles per minute. Just make sure you have your handy 10 second rewind button.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a thinking man\u2019s slice of life show, much in the vein of Welcome to the NHK (Another excellent show). If you\u2019re up to the challenge of blisteringly fast paced talking, surreal imagery, and putting on your thinking cap, you will be rewarded with a satisfying show that will touch you in one way or another. I give Tatami Galaxy a well deserved 9/10 (Awesome).\\n\\n\r\nPS: Feel free to comment on my review. I'm always up for advice so I can improve my reviewing skills. Thanks for reading!",

It's got text out the butt, faster than that of the Monogatari series, and the story of reliving your college years over and over again can be quite boring. But I think they're trying to show that any small change in your life can lead to a drastically different outcome and a very different journey. This show definitely proves that anime is not a genre, but a medium that can really make people think and tell a great story/make a point. It's definitely a wild ride that isn't very easy to keep up with but once you'vemade it on (after the first couple of episodes and you're used to the pace) I'd say it's a worthwhile one. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very different which makes it interesting. At first it feels crude and like a simple cartoon but once it starts using mixed media and its varities of seemingly random color, it feels refreshing as its totally different from most all anime. I could see a lot of people calling it pretentious, but that's typically an honor, to be so innovative that traditional anime watchers think you're trying too hard. The music was very fitting. Pretentious shows must have pretentious music such as classical orchestral pieces but the OP and ED are just absolutely fantastic. The OP has a happy go lucky vibe to it, just as younger people should look towards their future, and the ED has a more cool, inquisitive feeling that makes you think of introspection and finding yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is of many metaphors and takes a lot more thinking than your typical show. Shows that do this typically seem pretentious but in reality they're just trying to break the social norm of anime and prove anime not to be a genre of generic tropes and childish motifs. Tatami Galaxy's themes and setting are very adult so this show shouldn't make sense for a younger audience and should be enjoyed by older/intellectual people. Not saying younger people shouldn't try watching this show, it just probably won't suit them as it's very introspective and symbollic. There's no tsunderes, no fanservice, nothing from the bible of anime tropes that most anime have to follow to have success which makes it very refreshing and unique. Of course it's not the first show to do this and have the themes of hardships and finding your place in the world, but it still manages to feel very unique. I don't think any casual anime watcher should watch this show because you can't just turn off your brain and accept the plot. You have to really dig deep to obtain value from most episodes as it doesn't have comedy to push you through and it's not straightforward. I would highly suggest this show to people who search for depth of meaning in media.",

And basically his journey in life .. Why is this so good ? Just finish the entire series and you will know why it is so good. Although , the dialogue is a bit too fast sometimes but somehow i feel that everyone can manage :) IF you are looking at each individual episode , there is no meaning to the anime . You have to carry on watching until the end where all the emotions throwyou off. It will make you realized a lot of things and help you mature as a person . It is really REALLY A meaningful anime and the message it carry across is so powerful :)",

            "content": "Tatami Galaxy is weird in the most wonderful way possible.  Do not miss out on this! \r\nArt \r\nSo I'm starting with the art style and animation because that's probably the first thing that you're gonna notice about this show\u2014the art style is \"weird.\"  I've unfortunately witnessed many people online dismiss this anime because it looks \"weird.\"  Don't dismiss this anime because of its art style.  First off, Madhouse is still flexing its muscles here with the fluid animation, so it doesn't fail in that department.  As far as the style itself goes, the style works in conjunction with the show'sstorytelling, working to help convey and emphasize certain themes and ideas that are central to the show's topics.  Whether the style is aesthetically pleasing is a subjective matter, but because the style and animation work so closely with the text in telling the story, that's already something that most anime don't do.  Therefore, for it's art alone, I'd recommend the show as a must watch just to witness the possibilities of animation in terms of storytelling.  \\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\r\nThis show has a great OST, but you probably won't notice it because of the blinding speed at which the MC speaks.  While said speed is also something that will draw people away from this anime, don't let it.  It's something that you get used to because of reasons that you'll find when you watch the show, but also, the speed at which he speaks also works to characterize the MC and convey certain themes that the show addresses, which I won't specify because that leads me to the Story, which is my main gripe with the show.  \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThat is, if you're gonna call it a gripe.  My main problem with the story is that... there's not really a story.  The entire series is kinda just one big philosophical lesson.  Where super good anime like Evangelion will bury central themes under layers of plot, there's not exactly a plot in The Tatami Galaxy under which it can bury its themes.  It's purpose is to convey certain ideas it has about life, and it does so without wasting any time.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, because everything about the show from the music to the text to the speed of the text to the art style work so well together to convey these themes, it really doesn't matter.  Whether you actually want some overarching plot is up to you, but just know that plot isn't the main focus of The Tatami Galaxy\u2014its themes and ideas are.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\\n\r\nThey exist.  The very main characters represent certain people that will be inherently present in all of our lives as viewers at some point in our lives.  The presence of these characters also plays a huge part in conveying the show's themes and ideas, so again, I won't say any more so as to not spoil anyone.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, because of its lack of a plot and the show's mindset of \"here are some themes, hope you enjoy,\" I can't say I had the most fulfilling, life-changing experience watching The Tatami Galaxy, just because I rather that the show had buried its themes under layers of plot just so that I'd have to work harder to find said themes.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, because of how well The Tatami Galaxy does what it wants to do, I still enjoyed it a lot just witnessing the seemingly effortless interplay between the sound and the art and the characters.  I can't stress how much everything in this show matters, and the central themes and ideas that do come across, while it may not be groundbreaking for me personally, will inspire many other audiences.  \\n\\n\r\nTherefore, I cannot recommend this anime enough! ^_^ \\n\\n\r\n- MSYN",

(the answer: YOU by the end of the series.) unless you've been completely sheltered your entire life & have had no development as a person, this anime will probably be like \"oh that's neat\" & then you'll remember it as something w/ really weird but cool animation. the animation is sick as hell, that's probably the main thing to takeaway. funhouse was like, \"yo what's the craziest way we can animate this\" and then they were like \"LIFE ACTION LET'S GO LIFE ACTION AT SOME PARTS AND LET'S HAVE THE ANIMATION ACTUALLY PARALLEL TO THEMES\" and so they evangelioned this up & put in some random live action scenes. you're gonna be watching this & thinking, \"is this artistic? is this meaningful? does this have a deeper purpose? does my opinion matter?\" nah. it doesn't. this show doesn't care about you. what it DOES care about, though, is consensual sex, which is neat as all hell. NICE. again, what in god's name do i put for sound????? no idea. the voice acting is super fast, so the subs are super fast. if you can't read & comprehend quickly, this ain't for you. if you don't like your superego being represented by a sexually repressed cowboy, this also ain't for you!!",

Each episodes replays the exact same time frame of the characters life. You can think of it as a series of parallel universes that reveal \"happenings\". These instances are revealed as the result of slight changes in one's life. These course of events which we have no control over is something we like to dwell upon. As Neurotic beings we can spend a whole life time imagining how life might have been different had the tables turned to our favour. Off course itis all futile, a waste of effort and  energy. It is logically absurd trying to change what can never be undone.........but despite the truth the addictive mind simply cannot help it. \\n\\n\r\nThis show in a nutshell tries to capture the loud unstoppable train of thoughts that drive us and yet takes us nowhere. \\n\\n\r\nI have rated the Art a 4 based off of the technicality in representational art. But as a unique art form in and of itself, it has the potential of a 9 out of respect for uniqueness, simplicity and creativity.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nMemorable quotes episode 5\\n\\n\r\n\u7b2c\u4e94\u8a71\\n\\n\r\n\u300c\u305f\u3060\u4e00\u3064\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u306e\u304c\u3001\u307b\u3093\u308f\u304b\u3057\u904e\u304e\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002\u4e00\u8a00\u3067\u8a00\u3046\u3068\u7686\u5584\u4eba\u3059\u304e\u308b\u3002- \u79c1 3:20\\n\\n\r\n\" The only thing that worried me, was that it was a bit too warmly and snuggly.

I do believe that people can become to invested in the meaning of shows and the moral of Tatami Galaxy's story is hardly revolutionary but I feel it is at least well delivered, even though the structure of the narrative does limit the content of the episodes they are presented in a fun, fast paced and refreshing way which makesfor an enticing surreal roller coaster and the way the story pieces it self together over time is still engaging and paints an amusing and eccentric picture layer by layer. Although I'm willing to admit that this delivery may not be for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who enjoys the surreal and peculiar I would recommend this show highly! If you are searching for something to analyse and tear apart I'm afraid you will be disappointed but I would simply suggest to enjoy it for what it is, not all art must have deep and complex meaning for it still to be worthwhile, what's the harm in a little cliche every now and then for the sake of entertainment!",

Madhouse is known for its particular productions, and Tatami Galaxy fits perfectly in that category.  So, here we go!\r\nStory: The way it is presented is no short of being crafted in a very intelligent way, with a kind of non-linear narrative, and i say ''kind'' because in some cases it interconnects subtly certain scenes.  Each episodes has its distinctive mark, every time with distinctive characters, ambience and an underlying morality which is often presented at theend.   Anyway, its genius.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: Its unique, colorful, strange, hilarious at times.  It even combines shots from real life, usually with heavy filters to render them more ''artsy''.  Anyway, its genius.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Its entirely orchestrated, with a wide range of instruments brilliantly played:  piano, harmonicas, flutes, violins, trumpets and so on.  Only the opening and the ending are different: the opening is composed by Japanese rock band Kung fu Generation and they did a fantastic job because it fits perfectly the nature of the show; while the ending is more electronic and  chill.   Anyway, its genius.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  The protagonist of the show, an unnamed student in his first year of university, is a gentle and an easy going guy which only wants his university life be as full as possible.  He encounters in his path a bunch of people that i can assume at the end are his only true friends, most of all the mischievous Ozu that act as a douchebag towards him but he too is a good guy deep down and often helps the protagonist.    I won't spoil the others much, but i can assure each one of them are really odd and very well develpoed.   Oh, and one important thing:  the narrator speaks so damn fast.  And i mean, REALLY fast.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Its an unique work of art that i absolutely appreciated.  Its great, really really great.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(NOTE: If you\u00b4re looking for a unique aesthetic and an unconventional, more realistic or sort of, story in an anime, then you might want to just skip this review and watch The Tatami Galaxy. The show can really talk to you and become an instant favorite even with its flaws. In another hand, if you\u00b4re insecure about what you\u00b4re looking for then you might want to read this review before going ahead)\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy is an interesting show. The art style might ring some bells if you have seen Ping Pong the Animation or Kaiba, both from the same director Yuasa Masaaki. It\u00b4s based ona novel from Tomihiko Morimi, which I\u2019m yet to read, but it shows that the story is wasn\u00b4t designed for an anime and the series storytelling must go to unconventional places in order to deliver the story correctly. The show follows our nameless main protagonist during his college days. He joins a club and his hopes for the perfect student life are crushed by the circumstances. While I don\u00b4t want to spoil anything, it\u2019s important to remark the main mechanic of the show. The show kicks off with the protagonist joining a club in the first year and dealing with this choice until his third year. When we begin the next one, he decides for a different club in the first year and a different story unfolds. This might not sound that realistic as I claimed at the beginning, but bear with me. The storytelling changes further into the series, nonetheless knowing this mechanic is better to not be caught off-guard in the beginning. That is all that there is to say regarding the plot, apart from celebrating the ending as it's probably my favorite part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nFrom now on, the story keeps developing with a number of recurrent cast members. The stories often sound like that might actually have some truth in them, but with a narrator that is obviously exaggerating what is happening for the sake of comedy. The way on how these unrealistic stories occur in a college context give the series some kind of realistic feel, it\u00b4s the kind of tale you would hear from a dizzy classmate while resting in campus. While the character development is almost inexistent apart from the main protagonist, this is not a bad thing. The characters don\u00b4t evolve, the audience just learns more about them and their past actions take a different light. This is a really cool concept and one of the strongest points in Tatami Galaxy. The art is also really striking and one of the main reasons why I started reading about the show. And it doesn\u00b4t disappoint, it stays true to its unique style until the end, even mixing it up with photography at some points to create an even more interesting atmosphere. The connection between art/plot it\u00b4s also really clever, hard to realize to some extent but really cool to discuss. The OP and ED also live up to the rest of the quality of the show, both gorgeous in audio, visuals and meaning. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Tatami Galaxy comes out as a puzzle. It\u00b4s hard to grasp at the begging, but in the end everything (from the plot to the art) combines into a coherent big image. This is probably the main reason of why the show became so popular, the episodic format tends to be weak in coherence and this show uses that to its advantage. But, of course, there are also bad things.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing is a detail, but it can be a relevant one, especially if you are reading the subtitles/listening in any other language other than your mother tongue.  The talking and monologs get fast, like real fast, and it\u00b4s really easy to get lost in track and miss precious information. The pause button is going to be your friend in these situations, so don\u00b4t be afraid to use it. Of course, this is a circumstantial detail, but still important. Then there\u00b4s the middle chapters. It would be cruel to call them bad because they maintain quality, but the storytelling just fails in these ones. We start with an episodic format and end with a coherent big image, so it\u00b4s no surprise that the middle ended up suffering. The pace is slow, the stories are not that interesting until later on and the characters fail to use all of their potential as characters. The finale makes up for this joining the stories, but the middle was sad to watch for me. I would have given the series a solid 10 if it weren\u00b4t for these episodes, but it\u00b4s also true that the show just wouldn\u00b4t have worked without them. It\u00b4s also true that the experiences in these stories just didn\u00b4t get me as much as the other, so it\u00b4s highly probably that you might feel some kind of connection with them and thus enjoying them much more. There\u00b4s also the fact that the man in a dress \u201cjoke\u201d is thrown away a few times, yet it\u00b4s not played for laughs. It\u00b4s more of a part of the plot than a transphobic joke. It might bother you anyways, so watch out.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, it\u00b4s a good show. It has superb art, truly multifaceted characters and a finale that wraps up the plot in a brilliant way. With storytelling flaws at the middle and some unnecessary details, but still worth the watch. \\n",

I didn't know anything about it when I started watching it, and the short Hulu synopsis did not sound like anything particularly remarkable. However, from the first 30 seconds of struggling to keep up with the subtitles, I was already overwhelmed with not just the art, particularly how the trees in the scene looked like they were made of paper stars, but how close and real it all seemed. This show left a massive and lasting impression on me. I didn't realize how difficult this would be to write this until I started, because it's sopersonal. It's not like watching shounen, where everything is loud and in your face and shiny and bright, and in that way, distant. The Tatami Galaxy is distinctly down to earth. There's a lot to take in, so I would suggest you drink something with caffeine in it before you watch the first episode.",

            "content": "When I first saw this it reminded me of a joker quote in the Dark Knight \"I think we are destined to do this forever\" \r\nAnd that got me thinking, what if we were actually destined to repeat history, but instead of an exact occurrence of events, they're instead slightly changed and each time we journey through this alternate history we may see things from another perspective. Now when you start off watching this anime for the first time you could be forgiven for not knowing what is going on, and for myself it took up to halfway through episode 2 to realise what thewhole story is about. But to not accidentally give off any spoilers I won't reveal too much of the show, because watching this for yourself and coming to your own conclusion is what I believe is the best way to watch a show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is very well written, and for those who don't know the story, well it's about a guy in College who spends two years of his college life hating it, and then reliving those same two years. The only difference is that he picks a different club or circle around the college to join with and so introduces all the characters in a different way altogether. It has a way of introducing every character in the show but in a completely new way. I wouldn't say that it introduces them in a very dramatic fashion, but the way they do introduce them is always varied slightly. This adds a whole new element, as I'm sure you've thought you yourself \"What if I met that guy differently\" or \"What if I was actually best friends with her\". And because of these small differences in each episode the characters are seen differently from the main characters' perspective, the nameless protagonist that is dubbed Watashi. \\n\r\nOverall the story is brilliant since it's original, sort of taking a Ground Hog day approach, only instead of repeating a single day, the main character is instead repeating a cycle of two whole years.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is probably what will scare people away from this show, since it's simplistic design doesn't have all that cutting edge features that you'd expect from an anime that was released in 2010. But the animation is by no means sloppy, not at all. The show even takes in real world elements that really did draw me in further since it's a hybrid of animation and real life. However, this also may be a turn off from people that might want to watch this show, so if you have the guts to sit through and tolerate the art style, who knows ? You might actually begin to like it further down the show since the quality stays through the entire time. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound track is just gorgeous, with a kickass OP and ED, I really enjoyed listening to both all the way through. It also show cases some interesting music appropriate to the scene throughout the entire show, simple yet enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nI don't really like rating a show based on individual things, since what's the point of having a good art style when the characters suck. However this show does not suffer from that at all, no way. It somehow brings that idea that we all have of \"What if I lived my life differently\", that and accompanied when one of the character says \"It doesn't matter which path you took, you'd keep ending up where you are now\" to me that's the sort of motivation to the viewer, to change and control your life to how you see fit. But I guess I'm getting off track.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAccompanied with some brilliant writing, a nice simple artstyle, and a kick ass sound track this show is probably the embodiment of near perfection\\n\\n",

Many of my friends told me it was what put them off but once you see it you will love it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was splendid. It is shown slightly through each recall. But it hits you hard in the face near the ending. The intended message on the desire for more in everyday life was well conveyed.Point is life has no right answer, every life has pro's and cons.

For example, which club the main character joins or how he meets the love interest. Though when the main character explains the personalities of characters to us each episode, it can get a little tedious but then the unique bits start happening again and it\u2019s all good. \ud83d\udc4d\r\nCharacters: The characters are very unique as they aren\u2019t the stereotypical anime shells.Trying not to get into any spoilers soI will say they were kinda all over the place but this part of them really intrigued me.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Oh. Boy. The animation. I\u2026 sorta\u2026 liked\u2026 the animation? Like I did. It was very unique in that it was a mix of real world video and the colorful animation. It was really actiony (making up words cuz I don\u2019t know how else to describe it so\u2026.) and in your face. For that fact alone, though I liked this anime, I had to take a break in between episodes. Like, it took me 3 months to finish this series because the animation was all over the place at times. It doesn\u2019t help when the protagonist is talking like a football announcer, but in Japanese so I can\u2019t understand what the f-. *ahem* (excuse me.) I just couldn\u2019t understand what he was trying to say when he was narrating sometimes. Combine that with the \u201cwhat are you even trying to say/ actiony (yes it\u2019s a word now)\u201d animation, I just couldn\u2019t take it. I had to take a break in between some episodes. It for this alone that I gave 8 \u2b50 and not 9.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Meh. It was there. And the opening and ending songs were OK. Though I will say that I enjoyed the ending song more than the opening. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion/ Recommendation: If you like time travel, groundhog-day-but-not, somewhat philosophical stories with animation that\u2019s unique and adventurous then hit this series up! \u261d\ufe0f",

The visuals are nice without being as excessive as _Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei_ often was, and the stories are pretty interesting and are building up into an interesting meta-story (combining the Proxy War and movie expose and others), although the permuting elements sometimes make them a bit predictable (in one episode, it was easy to guess that the penpal was Akashi-san, just because she wasn't showing up enough). The art is varied & experimental, and who can dislike the OST with Kung Fu Revolution?\r\nFinally, I'm pleased with _Tatami Galaxy_'s ending. It wrapped up everything very neatly and satisfactorily, although I'm still bothered by Higuchiin the first episode (was he really just joshing?

            "content": "* Its an easy 10, but i will prove you why its not at the same time.*\r\nI will give you a general \"Advice\" about this one don't take it lightly.\r\nThis show is about the life and how even the smallest of choices could affect it. Its all about the possibilities you got and how it turned out,slowly and effectively from every aspect of our MC's life our plot unravels. (Even tho the how everything is connected is way too convenient, like there are just too many connections to consider that a \"normal\" life,thus that's why its not a SoL) It has many twists and thewhole meaning of the show will seem incoherent even to the very end.Everything is of the essence, everything connects.(if it hadn't been a fictional show this would be a great downgrade,taking into consideration the above fact) There is actually more of a Com-rom and not so much of a mystery series. O_O\\n\r\nContinuing with the characters that are too good. Like \"How this anime introduce/made his characters\" is just Brilliant to Masterful.You can say that this is all about the char and especially our MC. His nature is just extremely easy to appeal to and incredibly believable or \"human\".He somewhat reminded me 8man (from Oregairu) ! Just remarkable,self centered MCs trying to live in their small vanilla worlds laid in roses !!\\n\r\nOff to the sounds and music. . . The OP was really simple and mysterious in its own way,definitely good and fitting but i believe it \"could have been better\".On the contrary, the ED was absolutely perfect, by that i mean the was no other way to do it other than that. Everything else is fine.\\n\r\nThe art style is really questionable here. Well if you are aware this is a show by MadHouse and they deliberately made it look this way. I Can surely say 1 thing. Either it was made by a genius or it is absolutely pretentious !!To be honest i will go with the latter. I found its art captivating,amusing and splendid in general but it is for sure pretentious as f*ck!!\\n\r\n----------------------------------Personal thoughts and weaknesses-----------------------------------\\n\r\nWell if you don't turn of your brain while watching this you can pretty much see the greatness of the show. The foreshadowing, the Deepness, the MC self analyzing himself-the story and in general this was goddamn VERY WELL MADE!!It got almost everyting. Its one with no other definitely but. . . Lets start calling out its weaknesses shall we?\\n\r\nFirstly this show has no clear point or meaning until pretty late...In other words its only way of attracting you is out of curiosity about \"WTF\" is going on there. . .Secondly , the fact that this show is good because you can't grasp its meaning and seeing it is becoming a self challenge. I personally found this pretty irritating cause in other words you are being deceived but, well that's just me.Additionally, this show contains many memes but its hard to notice them.IF you paid enough attention the were small plot holes and the story wasn't so great. THE WAY the story was presented was great. In other words \"The quality of the direction was what made it such a good film\".Literally!!! Last but not least, the \"fabulous\" art. Personally more that fabulous and brilliant it was pretentious in a very high degree... Like the way things were presented in order to reach a climax or wake emotion was ridiculous and beyond irritating !! Not to forger actually this is a comedy... still wondering why the \"mystery\" tag... Let me explain. This is supposed to be based on a mystery and in every mystery we usually have answers. . . IN REALITY tho this is based on a cheap romance with an unsolved mystery and the show being partial pseudo intellectual in order to amaze even the most hardcore viewer... How does it manage that? Well obviously via the fact of \"no actual\" point into the show and the mysterious atmosphere. The viewer is searching for answers in the smallest of details while losing the big idea.. Making you  lack perspective or fail to prioritize...\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, after i finished it i told to myself \"Oh boy this is clearly a 10/10 masterpiece\",but as i went and think of that the way it was \"presented\" to us viewers was a masterpiece.I mean give my gratz to the Director but the anime is just overwhelming the viewer by abusing the story and serve the precise info in order to make the mood(well the fact is irritating once its done more that 1~3 times but not something 100% bad).Seriously i believe its a 7, but giving it a 8 only because its one of the kind and deserves more recognition. Like the end was satisfying and stuff but it wasn't \"the one,you\" wanted to see.It was in fact foreshadowed from the very start and really nothing \"mindblowing\". More likely extremely magnified by the anime i could say...\\n\r\nIts definitely underrated!!This one is a huge one, capable of satisfying almost every viewer in a variety of ways!I definitely recommend it to everyone, but you need to be patient cause as i said its rather an unattractive one at the start!\\n\r\nReasons to watch it:\\n\r\n-Immerse Story,Chars\\n\r\n-Enjoyable and overwhelming, especially for critical thinkers \\n\r\n-One of a Kind. Don't miss it!",

            "content": "Story\r\nThe tatami galaxy is about \"Watashi\" and his various adventures throughout collage as he explore various circles in collage.saying that may be a bit misleading since after every episode it rest to the beginning of his first day of collage to select from his many choices of clubs.When ever there's a rest certain variable remain constant throughout the anime like meeting x or y.\r\nYou would imagine this would get some what repetitious but this is mostly prevented by the introduction of new character or the execution of another. The series even throw me for a loop when I thought out that I\r\nhad the story completelyfigured that being a romance with akashi a first year with an strong will and icy cold stare but has one unexpected trait about her that allow our protagonist to become a friend of hers.The most interesting part of \"tatami galaxy\" was seeing how incredibly different thing were for every loop the protagonist experienced. Along with the different things we'd learn about our supporting cast's like hobbies or personal relationships. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe look is cartoony and lacks a  lot of detail in the character designs but this is more of a plus since it allow the animator to draw imagery which is silly,bizarre,or abstract. This reminded me of how Shaft does there anime. this anime also has a special way with colors were the character will be presented in a moody gray but has a bright colors all within the background. It really grabs your attention in the way other anime don't.\\n\\n\r\nanimation\\n\\n\r\nmadhouse animated and its very different from what I'd expect from them. They usually make series with highly detailed characters and fast moving action scenes.In this anime the characters move in a cartoony and smooth fashion with a more squishy looking characters than the more sharp looking ones we usually see.  \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a music expert but I can say that the music meld perfectly well with whatever scene was being presented. Along with that I can say I didn't skip listening to the intro once . \\n\\n\r\ncharacters\\n\\n\r\n\"Watashi\"- seems to be your average guy who is a bit socially inept.So he wants a rose colored collage life along filled with a raven haired beauty for a girlfriend. He mostly believes that joining a circle will accomplish this ,but always end's up wasting one year of his life he seems to be somewhat of a hopeless individual who isn't content with life.Watashi was naive in thinking any club would help him achieve his dream.But the crazy amount of effort he puts  in accomplishing his goal along with his internal monologue about the situation happening around made him a very likable character\\n\\n\\n\r\nOzu- my favorite character whom is the best friend/worst enemy of our main character. he has a devilish demeanor and always seems to be plotting something. to the point were he always making our protagonist the victim of his cruel jokes that ruined our heroes life. The character basically did whatever he wants.\\n\\n\r\nThis also is one of the few anime where I found myself liking every character. Even ones who debuted more antagonistic. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nTheirs not much to say besides I really liked it. The show also has a great sense of humor which had me laughing or smiling on several occasions. Great character's with a shocking good ending which left me fulfilled with what I but left me wanting a bit. The only criticism I can give is that it is repetitive to the point you know what happening next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI Recommend this to anyone wanting something different. The only thing hold this back from being absolutely perfect is how repetitious it is. Overall this show is amazing.",

            "content": "Tatami Galaxy has a highly peculiar narrative, most of this having to do with the fact it deals with alternative realities. So much so that the story could easily be summed in three episodes, but the objective isn't merely to tell the story but to convey a powerful message.\r\nOne of the best things in this anime is that it's deep as an ocean, but its waters are clear and you can see the benthic zone. It's not highly complicated, although it is full of amazing details and has a complex objective, most of the nuances are understandable and observable by the most realistic, \"unimaginative\" typeof person. The use of arts, sounds, plot devices etc. are all explained, and everyone is able to understand that, instead of just people with an amazing attention to details. There's little implicit here, pretty much everything is explicit.\\n\\n\r\nI could even say here what's the message it tells but I assure you that you WILL UNDERSTAND IT PERFECTLY as you finish it. This is for me the high point of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't really complex (aside from Watashi himself) but that is not really necessary. They fit their role, whatever they are, pretty well. They're interesting and unique, and not eccentric for the sake of \"look I can make some fancy characters\".\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic. If features either minimalistic animation with great character designs or small excerpts of real life and character interaction. Those moments are really subtle and add special flavour.\\n\\n\r\nMy review as I have observed wasn't particularly descriptive, so pardon for that. I think my point, the point I'm trying to make, is that this is a really intelligent anime. Nothing on it exists just because, and by the ending you will understand its lore and peculiarities entirely. So if you wanna feel smart by saying 'I understood all the metaphors', go for it.",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nFormulating this review was actually quite difficult because while I both admired and enjoyed the visuals and characters of this anime, I felt as if I had to force myself to sit through it.\r\nStory: 7.5/10\r\nThe plot and how each episode flows within each other is actually done very cleverly. Essentially we follow Watashi as he struggles in college to find pure enjoyment and love. His so called friend Ozu is always causing trouble and leading Watashi down the wrong path but they always end up sticking up for each other. The love interest of the show Akashi isn\u2019t utilized asmuch as she could have been but overall she plays a pretty important role in the story. So essentially in the beginning episodes we get a deji vu feeling because we see the same timeline played over and over again with the clubs Watashi joins changes every time and plays out differently but achieves the same outcome. It isn\u2019t until the final episodes that everything comes together and you get that, \u201cOHH so that\u2019s why that happened\u201d satisfaction. Still even after eleven episodes I wonder why I sat through this show. I will admit that the plot was interesting and original but it still provided little enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show sports a very abstract scheme that works very well with the universe. We see a lot of different animation styles used in many different ways to set the mood. My general opinion is that Madhouse really is one of the great forerunners of animation. This show was very visually appealing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6.2/10\\n\\n\r\nThere wasn\u2019t really a lot to comment on about the sound of this anime. While the music wasn\u2019t distracting, it wasn\u2019t anything to really comment on. The only praise should go to the voice actors. Atashi, Ozu, and Watashi had spot on performances and their voice actors really brought out their personalities well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only other thing that I found this show delivered on other than the animation was the characters. To me a really well done character is someone you remember weeks or years after you watch a show. While I just recently finished this anime, the cast really left a lasting impression on me. The way the characters interacted with each other was very amusing and overall was what kept me coming back. A well done cast can help keep viewers stay hooked even if the plot is lacking or unenjoyable (Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, Angel Beats!, K-On!, ext.).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did not enjoy this show, the abstract animation style and close nick pack of characters really helped turn this deji vu, soul searching anime into something that I could sit through. Now I really bashed the plot and I do not want this to turn you away from watching the show. The plot IS original and thought provoking; I just either wasn\u2019t in the correct mindset or mood to watch a show of this nature. First glances made me believe it was a lighthearted comedy but it turned out to be something drastically different. Regardless I only review with the facts and what I can explain so taking my personal feelings about the show out of the question, it\u2019s worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",
