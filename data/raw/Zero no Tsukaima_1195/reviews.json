            "content": "I decided to watch Zero no Tsukaima because I wanted a leave-your-brain-out-of-the-equation sort of show, one I could sit back and watch without worrying about a negative outcome or depressing and/or disturbing complications. (Yes, for all my talk about artistic integrity and such, I do watch things for pure and simple fun sometimes.) Zero has most of that, but only to a point, and in the end I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of depth this show manages to pull out of nowhere. I went in expecting another Nanoha, or the first season of Shakugan no Shana all over again, and what I gotwas something more akin to the comedic romance and character development of Love Hina supported and sustained by the political intrigue of Last Exile or Simoun.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: An incompetent mage summons as her familiar a young man from contemporary Japan, and hilarity ensues. It isn't quite as simple as that, however. Despite an early focus on slapstick comedy, ecchi, and outright silliness, Zero quickly introduces a thin political thread, providing bits and pieces of flavor to make the world seem more alive. This thread smoothly escalates into a significant driving force of the show's events, perhaps more powerful, even, than the central romance.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of that central romance, it moves along at a nice pace -- neither too slowly nor too quickly for a 13-episode series. Exactly how it develops is for you to discover, but rest assured that it does not remain stagnant for long periods of time, at least in this season, as in Shakugan no Shana and its sequel.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The cute, borderline-sadist lead; the busty, libidinous rival; the surprisingly forthright maid; the bookish, quiet Nagato Yuki clone -- these may seem like stock characters pulled from the harem romance pool, and they certainly begin as such. As in Love Hina, however, we discover that these characters have histories and unforeseen connections, sometimes in far darker ways than I expected of this show. What's more, many of these characters actually change over time, as characters in a story should. Sure, the cast seems a bit crazy at first, but give them a chance. It's worth it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the male lead. Oh, the male lead. Saito's personality is what makes him simultaneously hilarious and divergent from the usual harem romance/datesim beta-male loser. We get the impression that he checks out every girl who crosses his path not because he's hopelessly desperate, but because he's a healthy teenage boy. Not that he's relegated to the role of lecher; he has his human and hero moments, too.\\n\\n\r\nSetting: Our story begins in your average Harry Potter-inspired magic school, complete with magic wands and quirky professors, but soon expands outward to encompass an alternate-history, magically-endowed Europe plagued by the class politics of magocracy -- that is, magi over non-magi. Though the central country of the show is fictional (apparently located roughly in the Aquitaine region of France), several real-world European powers have fantastical equivalents, often bearing the Latin names of the modern countries they mirror: Gallia is France, for example, and Germania is Germany. This becomes clear when we see a map of the fictional land. This world maintains interesting links to our Earth, but I'll leave it at that for fear of dropping spoilers. It's ultimately a surprisingly cohesive fantasy setting, and one to which I wouldn't mind returning.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Zero's art is reminiscent of Shakugan no Shana, also produced by J. C. Staff, and to a lesser extent Pani Poni Dash. It's a style that grew on me when I watched Shana. If you're a fan of more realistic art in your animation, however, be warned that you won't find it here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Despite being largely digital, Zero's music never quite descends into full-on cheesiness, as Shana's music did at times, nor does it overwhelm you with anachronistic elements unsuited to the vaguely Renaissance-inspired fantasy setting. The opening theme is quite catchy, for a reason I can't place, and as a fan of Kugimiya Rie and Hino Satoshi, I have trouble finding serious fault in the voice-acting.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: I didn't think Zero no Tsukaima would end up being the kind of show I'd be quick to recommend, but, to my pleasant surprise, it did. If you're looking for a tale of politics and romantic comedy, and don't mind that the ride isn't entirely serious from beginning to end, give this one a shot.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nDo you like Moe? Do you like S&M? Do you like obnoxious female leads? Boy do I have a series for you!\r\nPlot: 3/10 \r\nFamiliar of Zero is an anime about an ordinary boy named Saito that is forced to be a magical slave to an obnoxious twat that summoned him from Japan to the far away land of extremely generic fantasy Europe. Here he must learn to adapt to his odd new life and learn about the various types of magic users. I am not going to go really in depth with the plot honestly. It soon becomes a very generic harem show and theplot is NOT going to blow you away. Here is a summary of the plot: Louise the witch treats Saito like crap, the abuse is played up for cheap laughs, Saito uses his magic sword wielding ability to do something heroic, he still gets treated like crap. rinse and repeat. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main male character Saito is exceedingly bland and Louise is the least likeable female lead I have seen in a long time! There are also plenty of supporting characters, but there really wasn't anyone I liked in this series. Usually I can find a couple characters I like in even the most mediocre anime, but here I got nothing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good since this anime had a decent budget. It was based on a successful light novel that I can only assume was somehow better than the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 if you aren't a masochist, 7/10 if you are.\\n\\n\r\nRemember in early 2014 when Japanese men were drooling over the uniformed hottie Natalia Poklanskaya and some Japanese youtube poster stated: \"I want her to yell at me and step on me\"? That is this entire fucking series in a nutshell. It is a fantasy for Japanese teen masochists who want to be dominated by hot European women. I'm not a masochist, and I don't see white girls as an exotic fetish, so I really didn't find anything to like in this series besides a few decent slapstick moments. The comedy sort of works in a few places, but mostly it is just obnoxious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI have met people (including one of my best friends) that thought this series was a comedic masterpiece. I REALLY don't agree with that assessment, but the series at least does some things right. The art is decent, the music is decent, the voice acting is fine. However, I felt that overall this was a very mediocre series that I wouldn't recommend to anyone...unless once again you are in fact a male masochist.",

            "content": "This is my second review of an anime series.  Please spare me. xD;\r\nI don't do many reviews on shows but I would like to review on this one. Since this series touched me a lot and its my childhood. :P\r\nOne of the series that expanded my variety of anime after Inuyasha and Shana.\r\nStory:\r\nYou have Louise, your mage that possess terrible magic and a boy that came from another world. He has to deal with the customs in Louise's world and has to face many obstacles; and with war, I'm not gonna spoil. Or I will try not too.\r\nThis series is a comedy, so itdoes have some harem/ecchi involvement. Though, I think this series would be better off without the ecchi and the harem. That way, the characters have room to develop.\\n\\n\r\nSo I would give the story an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very beautiful to look at. I love the character designs of the show; which made me want to continue to watch it. The fighting scenes was well done; with the graphics. I wish more anime would have art like this; and the art also reminded me of Shakugan no Shana. With Saito resembling Yuuji. :P\"\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, 10/10  for the art. 8D\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nSome of the music in the anime was really pretty, I liked how it worked well with the show. But I could NOT stand the ending themes. The opening themes were more--enjoyable. But I liked the second seasons opening the best overall; so the sound I would give\\n\\n\r\n7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters could use a little bit more development in the show. Like everyone else has said; I think Louise should START to trust Saito more instead of beating the poor guy senseless; and Saito should try to control himself more around the women. But then again, he's a 17 year old boy and pretty much the only guy other then Guiche. But what disappointed me, some of the characters you don't get to know about. And they're just there.\\n\\n\r\nLike Siesta, Kirche, Guiche, Montomorency. I probably spelled her name wrong, so shoot me.  Lot of characters like those are so undeveloped, it makes me a bit sad that you never know anything about them. The only real characters that are actually developed are Tabitha, Julio, and Agnes.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying that Saito is undeveloped since he does get stronger within the series and doesn't remain, \"weak,\" throughout. I just wish they would give more bio on Saito; like his past. Etc. But what puzzles me, I remember him in the first season saying he does not have a family. So that makes me wonder about him more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, the characters COULD use some improvement.\\n\r\nTo make a better series.\\n\\n\r\nSo I give a characters a \\n\\n\r\n6/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe series kept me watching until the very end. So despite the negative things about the show; it still made me want to keep on watching more and was sad about the end of the series. The season I liked the best was the second and the fourth season. Since characters started to develop more then; but you still wish to know about them. :P\\n\\n\r\nSo Enjoyment overall in Zero no Tsukaima.\\n\\n\r\n8/10.",

            "content": "Zero no Tsukaima-- The Familiar of Zero. With a badass name like that, what could go wrong? Awesome action with a really nice romance subplot, now that's what I like in anime. Which isn't what Zero no Tsukaima has. At. All.\r\nStory: 3\r\nTo sum up the entire plot in Zero no Tsukaima in one sentence, it would be, \"I feel like it'd be a lot better if I was nine.\" Me, personally, I'm an over analytical prick who over thinks every little thing. But I feel like someone with the IQ of a potato would still find the plot holes in this swiss cheese. To startoff, I'll list the pros. Just a little side note, I had to actually keep a notepad file open when watching this incase there was any little thing I liked in this show, because, believe me, I wanted to like it. \\n\r\n-The beginning of episode seven [Minor Spoiler: Saito is rewarded with a kiss from the princess and he does it too romantically and she passes out. Don't know why, I just thought it was funny.]\\n\r\n-The end of episode eleven [Major Spoiler: Not gonna say anything, but it was really satisfying after how bitchy Louise is to Saito.]\\n\r\n-The Ending Scene\\n\r\nThat's it. I kept a f**king list open the entire time. Alright, well, not going to turn into a rant, but, the main problem with the plot is that it's super predictable. You see everything coming a mile away. It's really generic, as well. However, the biggest, worst by far, always-there problem is that everything is too rushed. Way, way too rushed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nMeh.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the royalty free sound effects that were used in the final episode. The budget on this show was shit, to say the least, but the fact that they waited to spend the rest of their budget on the final episode, which was, as usual, too rushed and no build up. OP was decent. Yes, I do realize that being royalty free, they didn't cost money, and I made the point about the budget earlier, but I'll get more into it later.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nWow. I was just blown away by how generic and uninteresting every character was. The tsundere, Louise, isn't a tsundere. You see, with a tsundere character archtype, you have to have the character show affection towards another character after time. Does Zero no Tsukaima do this? *The rest of the character section is a spoiler* Yes, and it was very satisfying, to say the least. It was the filler episode, or at least I thought it was filler, episode six, or something like that. Louise drank a love potion by accident, and then grew really affectionate to our super generic and uninteresting protagonist, Saito. One of the characters who never appears after this episode said that it would last a year or so, so I thought it'd be until the end of the show, or at least the season. Needless to say, I was glad it happened. No more masochistic humor or fanservice (sometimes I'm not even sure), and finally a good female protagonist. Clingy, but cute. It all ends. And not on the final episode, the end of that episode, and very abruptly, I might add.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nYou know, for all the things this show completely and utterly fails at, there is a few good things. For example, if you were a masochist, the five would probably be higher. The very few, and I think there was about three total scenes of actual action in this entire season, were average. The budget was very lightly spent, and it was very clear to see that, and then the remaining budget at the end was spent entirely on the final episode, as I said above, which was cool, I guess. But it was cruel, too. Maybe the other episodes could have been good, like the royalty free sound effects in the opening of the final episode, but no. Not even close. The second thing I wanted to address in this is the transitions. That little wand that flips across the screen and that stupid royalty free sound effect plays. You'll hear it so many times. So many. The third thing is that the opening's lyrics make it seem like the show will be romance intensive, which isn't a bad thing by any means, but it's quite the opposite. It's probably, in order from most in the show to least in the show, unfunny generic comedy, decent action, masochistic fanservice, romance. It's just bad. At some places, it's so bad it's actually kinda good. But that's as far as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nIt was quite bad. Upon watching this, go in with low expectations and leave with lower ones. Seriously, it's bad. Just go watch something else. Anything else. Seriously. Please. I wish this show was good. I wish I wish I wish. But it's terrible. I'm actually sad to have had so high expectations for this show but instead was so drastically disappointed. Bottom line: This show is shit. Shit with a few sparkles, but none the less, shit.",

            "content": "I can&rsquo;t say I liked Zero no Tsukaima as much as hormonal, pre-teen male otaku out there. \r\nPlot-wise, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a revamped version of Maburaho. Other than being produced by JC Staff, the two series have other things in common. First off there&rsquo;s the setting &ndash; both series are set in a magic school. There&rsquo;s also the harem anime aspect &ndash; Louise, Siesta (my favorite!) and Kirche are all fighting over the token loser male character, Saito. Finally, there&rsquo;s the ecchi. It&rsquo;s a good thing that the ecchi in Zero no Tsukaima isn&rsquo;t as heavy as Maburaho&rsquo;s.\r\nIt was a stable ride for me duringthe whole series. There were no high points and low points. Let me reinforce my first point by saying that if I were a guy I would probably like Zero no Tsukaima more. Louise&rsquo;s tsundere antics would probably captivate me, and Kirche&rsquo;s presence would probably get my temperature rising, but that will probably never happen. As for Saito, he didn&rsquo;t really catch my attention. I did love watching his fight scenes but when he&rsquo;s not fighting, he&rsquo;s quite bland. Tabitha is too reminiscent of Yuki Nagato for me, but she&rsquo;s not as cool.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of JC Staff, the animation was good enough to satisfy me. Everything was very cutesy though &ndash; from Louise&rsquo;s pink hair (as well as the bevy of pastel color schemes throughout the series) to the Pokemon-ish familiars (except Saito, of course). The CG was lukewarm, and it&rsquo;s a good thing they used CG minimally.\\n\\n\r\nApparently most of the voice actors of Zero no Tsukaima also worked in Shakugan no Shana. The most notable name would be Rie Kugimiya, Louise&rsquo;s seiyuu, who is known as a tsundere seiyuu. She was Shana in Shakugan no Shana. There&rsquo;s also Satoshi Hino, Saito&rsquo;s seiyuu, who was Sakai Yuuji in Shakugan no Shana. Other name worthy of mentioning is the very well known Yui Horie, Siesta&rsquo;s seiyuu and Takahiro Sakurai, Guiche&rsquo;s seiyuu.\\n\\n\r\nI like the music too. The opening and ending themes were both j-pop-ish, which can be a good thing. Both songs were very cutesy and catchy, and I liked both. As for the BGM, I&rsquo;d say they were decent tracks. The BGM was fitting to the mood and feel of the series, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s THAT good.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wasn&rsquo;t that pleased with it, it wasn&rsquo;t so bad after all. It started and ended on the same note and consistency is a good thing for me. I might watch the second season just to see if I&rsquo;ll like it more.",

            "content": "Zero no Tsukaima takes place in an alternate world where magic and dragons exist. The majority of the story takes place at a magical academy where students train to become successful mages. Everybody has their own specialty whether it be earth magic or water. Enter Louise de long name not worth typing out. Louise is a high strung and cocky mage wannabe who can't do much of anything right. Every spell she attempts to cast seems to fail miserably and just blow things up. During the ceremony to summon what is to be your familiar forever more, she ends up summoning a boy by thename of Saito who comes from our world; more particularly Japan. So while everybody else has salamanders, moles, frogs and other creatures, Louise has a boy. \\n\\n\r\nThe story progression is all about the relationship that builds between Louise and Saito. She treats him like a familiar, or to be more precise like a slave pet. He has to wash her clothes, do her menial chores and even sleeps on the floor. Throughout the show their relationship begins to develop more and small plot twists are slowly introduced. Why the boy is special. Why Louise just seems to mess everything up. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story in ZnT is nothing that hasn't been done before. I don't like to grade based on precedence though as it is not fair to the subject matter. Louise and Saito slowly come together to make a good team and other characters are introduced that turn the show into &quot;Friends&quot; just with spell casting. It does get quite serious towards the latter part of the series, and I would say that it was actually pulled off quite nicely. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nAs I said in my opening paragraph, the initial thing that even got me to watch this show was Louise. I do hate to admit but I thought she was hot. I completely understand if you hit that back button right now. Even after the show is done, I still do. Remember, the back button is at the top left of your browser window, or you can just hit backspace. Anyway, the characters are all quite attractive in their actual originality. It does have the whole JC Staff production feel to it in the character design, but they are all nicely done. Although if you have a problem with the male in anime always looking like an average guy, you'll likely not like Saito's overall design. But if you enjoy big eyed cute girls, lolis, big breasted fiery red heads; then this show is gonna make you have a nerdgasm. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully the background animations are all paid attention to. Usually in shows like this, all the detail goes into character development and the background is left to die in a dark corner. Thankfully this wasn't the case with ZnT. Another thing that caught me by surprise is that they managed to throw in some obvious CG scenes without them standing out too much or just ruining the whole animation feel. When many shows throw CG into the mix, they make it stick out and just look awful, almost to say &quot;check out what we can do.&quot; ZnT does a wonderful job of balancing it out and pulls off a solid animation effort in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe first things that should always been addressed in the sound department is the opening and closing songs. Dead on! The opening is &quot;First Kiss&quot; by Ichiko and couldn't be more fitting for the tone of the show. The lyrics make much more sense than many Japanese songs tend to, and quite frankly it's catchy. Definitely recommended for the playlists out there. The background was fitting, which is really all you can ask from anime. The music played always fit the situation and there were a few that stuck out and were able to do a masterful job of getting the viewer into the emotional situation. Playful music was the main course for the show as it tends to be much more humorous and whimsical than anything. But when it got serious, the music did a great job of presenting that to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was actually quite phenomenal. Every character fit their personalities well. Even though I can't stand the overly effeminate characters in anime, at least he was voiced well. Louise had the very defiant, cocky and sometimes very vulnerable feel to here. I thought of her kind of as I did Naru from Love Hina. Except not so much of a b*tch (God I hate Naru). Saito was considerably better than many main male characters usually are. For once in anime, the guy wasn't represented by a complete and total nerd. He was actually a strong, intelligent and thoughtful guy. He had his moments, but overall when he talked, he kinda made me proud for us; for once. But the voice acting award has to go Nanako Inoue as Kirche. Kirche was the virtual arch-rival of Louise. She was one of the good ones at magic and made a point to rub it in the face of Louise as much as she could. Her character was given the voice of condescending know-it-all. She was also the school flirt, a serious mage and a seductress. Japanese women can be sexy, but their voices rarely scream sexual seduction. She manages to seduces the viewer, male viewer, quite nicely. That's an accomplishment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, ZnT is a short anime that is just entertaining. It doesn't provide a terribly deep plot. Many of the tools used in this show have been used many times before. The characters can be considered somewhat cliche. But that may be one of its charms. It doesn't make you think outside of your anime paradigm. It just allows you to sit down and enjoy the hijinks and life of some crazy characters. I can say that I just couldn't stop watching it once I started; it is one of those shows that just makes time fly so much faster. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have had your fill of &quot;guy can't admit to girl, girl can't admit to guy&quot;, girl hit guy for no reason or anything like that, you may want to steer clear from watching Zero no Tsukaima. Everybody else will pull something out of it in end that they will enjoy. I guarantee it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning: Minor spoilers (that don't really ruin much at all), as you'll see the majority within the first two episodes.\r\nThis is a review for all four seasons, posted here to warn you of how much pain you might be coming across. I've watched some pretty bad anime but Zero no Tsukaima and its sequels are very high up. I was spurred to finish it by the suggestion of a friend saying it got better and because I can't stop what I've started. Note - This is my first review and my opinion, think of it as you will.\r\nStory 4/10\r\nOver four seasons half the 50 orso episodes could probably be considered fillers. The storyline itself jumps from one sudden and convenient issue to another with not much really linking it together. Zero's subplot of the apparent romance between the Mage and her familiar attempting to progress yet the situations they pop up in are beyond repetitive and dull.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nNothing amazing and nothing awful, nothing about the art really bothered me nor drew my fascination.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nSee the above \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\r\nHere's the best bit. Within most anime that have two MC's, you'd hope to like at least 1 of them. Nope. As shown in the synopsis, Louise is a mate whose powers are lackluster. Her apparent talent that is picked up involves the overused \"explosion\" spell that is seen at a minimum of 3 times an episode. Her other talent is kicking the other Mc in the balls, as well as being an unsympathetic, trust/confidence lacking, angry, wannabe tsundere who never fails to be annoying. Saito, realistically, is just as bad, as someone who got transported from Earth to a different planet/universe, and immediately treated like shit (or a plebian) he, throughout most of the series, can be seen as someone without a backbone, who is probably a masochist considering he's so loyal and loving to a bitch that assaults him. Worse still, the 'assault' gag is so overused he just becomes a complete pushover whose only motive is to 'protect' someone who struggled to even comprehend his situation of being in a different world, and can't actually reciprocate his love 95% of the time. Funnily enough the best characters (with spines!!) were the supporting cast, Siesta, Jessica and Kirche, who actually had a personality and were enjoyable to watch. Later supporting characters are too, won't reveal names, but they somehow make you wish Saito picked a girl that, I don't know, actually and obviously likes/loves him. (P.s, this should have a harem tag instead of romance). All in all, don't get too attached to two boneheaded mc's, you'll be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3.5\\n\r\nI did like some of it, mainly when the supporting characters were largely involved with pissing off Louise as a team, otherwise I struggled through this when I usually finish a season (12 eps) a night rather than taking me two, dreadful, weeks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\r\nPlease be careful watching this (though hopefully I've put you off), don't expect anything to get better, Saito will always get caught being with someone else and the most overused gag ever will waste your time.",

            "content": "This one's gonna hurt, folks. My lowest review yet, but you should expect that from a series that capitalizes entirely on cliches without an ounce of originality or effort in any single field. Ladies and gentleman, I give you Zero no Tsukaima.\r\nGetting the technical bits out of the way, Zero no Tsukaima was average in audio and visual. No memorable BGM, forgettable OP, and an irritating ED, but the performances were rather pleasing in some cases. Rie Kugimiya plays the standard tsundere role well, but shines better in scenes where she's interacting with someone that isn't Saito, where her other sides become more apparent, suchas when she is with Henrietta. Unfortunately this doesn't happen often so it's mainly tsundere all the way. If you're into that, you're in luck. The rest of us aren't. Yui Horie and Ayako Kawasumi also turn in some decent though generic performances as Siesta and Henrietta respectively.\\n\\n\r\nVisual is just inconsistent. The character designs are very simplistic and basic with not much detail or imagination. While its very average most of the time, it becomes incredibly fluid at the oddest moments, such as a scene early on where Louise chases Saito around in front of Henrietta, or again where Saito fights Ward. Because the animation is so generic the majority of the series, these random bits of fluidity are suprisingly pleasing, but give a lasting impression that the series has been half-assing it.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed the series did half-ass it, and what better proof do you need than the characters? Rie Kugimiya typecast aside, mostly because it did work here, these characters border from stereotypical archetypes like Kirche to downright ripoffs like Tabitha, who is completely stealing from Yuki Nagato from her hobbies to the exact way she talks. It's like they told the seiyuu \"okay, now for this character, sound EXACTLY like Yuki Nagato from Haruhi.\"\\n\\n\r\nYet the biggest offender by far is Saito, one of the most irritating Mary Sues of a harem hero I've ever come across. Not only does he manage to attract nearly every girl to him even though he does nothing for half the series, but the plot decided to give him the ability to defeat anyone he faces, and the one time he does lose, he goes off and sulks about it as if he thinks it's his god-given right to defeat everyone.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, look... you have a fantasy world with magic and swords and dragons, so some special powers are to be expected, but the series actually gives Saito full deus ex machina capabilities by the end. It's disgusting how much this show gives him just so he can keep winning. The world of magic itself is no better. For a story relying a good deal on magic, the foundation of magic in this series is terribly simple. I will admit the cross-cultural \"magical artifacts\" were slightly amusing but even that grew tiresome.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting's relation aside, this series just doesn't know what it wants to do. It starts as a romantic comedy, then quickly shifts to a magical adventure without so much as a single notice. I also give no positive marks to a series that sets up a possible arc, then ends it after one episode with no resolution or purpose other than to show Louise in a bustier. Note that Louise in a bustier had nothing to do with the setup.\\n\\n\r\nThe best reason I can give for why this series was green-lit back in 2006 would be the boom of anime adapted from light novels and the birth of tsundere fandom, and it shows. There's so bad it's good and there's so bad I want to see just how bad it can get. Zero no Tsukaima is just bad. It's littered with cliches that have been run into the ground for years before this show, and the only new gag it can conjure up (horsewhip) just isn't funny no matter how much the series pushes them. Though Rie Kugimiya gives a solid performance and some of the world elements are intriguing, its desire to cater to every possible audience with a complete lack of direction or effort make it nothing short of a failure. If you're not a sexually-frustrated teenage boy who hasn't yet developed a distinction between good and bad anime, avoid this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Zero no Tsukaima a 3 out of 10.",

            "content": "Zero no Tsukaima should be an enjoyable action anime based in a majestically magical world, sadly it executes the premise horrendously, clinging to repetitive comedy and a subpar plot. The characters were written poorly; this is evidenced by their shallow nature and monotonous interaction, of which Saito and Louise are the worst offenders.\r\nSo, Zero no Tsukaima (after this abbreviated as ZnT) has a premise of a modern Japanese boy who ends up in a fantasy world after being summoned by her master, who happens to be a young, petite girl, with a fiery attitude. And with these two not getting along too well, this shouldset things up for a nice rom-com, right..?\\n\\n\r\nIn practise it gives a different result, the slapstick humour is overused and literally milked down to the very last drip. As a show which relies on its comedy, it should be a lot more variable. But because it lacked in this department, it often came over as annoying, this form of comedy has been used well, just not in this show. If you repeat the same guy getting hit by the same girl for doing the same troublemaking, you are not get any more fans from it. \\n\\n\r\nThe other part ZnT tries to attract its fans with is action and fighting against the forces of evil, now it did this a bit better. Though the plot itself was far too simple to be properly praised, the way it executed its action and the fact that it could get serious for once, meaning some actual romance ensuing, which came along with some cheesy lines by the protagonist was one of the few things I have enjoyed about the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself, which was put on a side track, is mainly about the two protagonists overcoming the tests they are given at their academy, and how they deal with their \"growing\" feelings with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe art-style is simple and quite easy to grasp, it suits the rom-com style it has. The animation is good, but nothing special. Not a lot to comment about this particular department. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound, which can be split into 3 different categories, Opening and ending themes, voice actors and general SFX. The first category, I think the opening fit the anime quite well, of course, it is all up to you whether you liked it or not, but if you enjoyed the anime a lot, the chance is a higher that you liked the themes and soundtrack it had as well. On the subject of voice actors I would like to stop a bit, since this anime contains what many have dubbed to be \"The Tsundere Queen\" in it. Now personally, I am not the biggest fan or her voice or roles, it is a little bit too high-pitched and comes over as annoying. Saito's image as a Louise's dog and maybe a slightly foolish teenager is well played by his respective voice actor. Other than that there is not too much to to be said. The SFX is something which is done, there is noting  extraordinarily odd. So it is hardly something people can discuss about. \\n\\n\r\nNow I will move on to the characters, which is my biggest disappointment of this whole series, there is not much in this pile of badly written characters I can give praise. So we have our main male protagonist Saito, who like I said earlier, came from the modern world, we know and live in. The first flaw I would like to give is, there is no desire to go back to his home. Does this person have the worst life in the world or something, normally, at that age. One would like to go back to his home. This is, in my opinion, a piece of bad writing on the aspect of backstory and character depth. By not making them have a past, they are very shallow, and this depth-ness is what distinguishes the generic character from the fleshed out one. \\n\\n\r\nThe second character who is ripe for some founded criticism is the main female protagonist, who is awfully loud & obnoxious. I would go as far to say that her character has been written in a way, that it effectively negates any progression this character could go through. When some kind of advance happens in the terms of romance between Saito and Louise (the main female protagonist), it is immediately undone by some kind of slapstick moment. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is not worth a lot either, they have a low amount of motivation and hardly any depth as to why they should fight the protagonists, aside from the whole evil organization stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion, is it worth watching? No. There is a lot of stuff which did this setup and plot better than this series, the positive point is that the second season is done a bit better, I might say that is worth watching.",

            "content": "Zero No Tsukaima is what you&rsquo;d get if you crossed the Harry Potter flicks and Shakugan no Shana. One wonders if the title of the show was a response to the mandate for one-word monikers: Here it Goes Again\r\nThe basic elements of these stories are repeated ad nauseam, but astonishingly there is absolutely no difference. Seeing as there is no hope for redeeming itself from turning to an appalling cliched harem anime, I could not bear watching any longer. It is amazing how it only took five episodes took to suck the life out of me. \r\nBut if you must know, the story started withSaito Hiraga being magically pulled away from Japan and warped to the Tristain Academy of Magic. There she met Louise Fran&ccedil;oise de lulu jar jar binks or whatever her full name was, who was responsible for summoning him. Saito with no clue with whats going on, suddenly became Louise servant. This is the beginning of a magical, romantic adventure between two completely people bond by one resolve. MAN, that is good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nBeneath the main canopy is another commoner/noble story. I keep wondering why anime always wants to aggregate class conflict in anime's, it is getting too monotonous and repetitive with all the &quot;He's/She's just a commoner&quot; BS getting repeated as twice as much as I can take. It just isnt interesting to have that as a imperative contest for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI am sick of how there is no development happening between the couple. They had a chance, since they already made out but there is always the harem value that gets in the way. Plus, it is repulsive that I get to see Louise feel resentment to Saito whenever he gets flirtatious, this inevitably follows, whipping the hell out of the boy, which is a tired comic relief that is used repeatedly, and grows more irritating each time.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is the exact quantity you get from the recipe of disaster: Harem, dumbass hero, abrasive heroine, unoriginal plot, crippled comedy, paucity of development and uninteresting progression. If that doesnt scares you one bit, then go ahead and watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nI fail to see how it even brought about to make a name for itself(and two more seasons!). This anime belongs only to from where whence it once came, the trash bin. Spend your time elsewhere(and spend it where at least you wont risk vomiting in the process.)",

            "content": "Wow, I really was not expecting this to be a good anime, but it turned out much much better than I thought it would. What looked like just an average \"I can't confess\" love story turned out to have something special in it, maybe because they got to the point within 13 episodes like most animes don't.\r\nSTORY: 9/10\r\nThe story is very unique, as far as I can tell. Louise can't use any magic, but on the day where all 2nd year students summon a familiar to help them, Louise summons a teenage boy from Japan, which is obviously another world from the magical world. Fromthere it just kind of flows, and the fillers are very entertaining too (If they can even be called fillers).\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like the eye styles in Zero, cause im big on those. Everything else is great as well, I didn't see too many cliches in terms of art (see character for the cliches)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, it wasn't anything special. I thought the theme songs were OK, and the music in the anime was good as well. Overall, it was just good. Nothing memorable or anything.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI am actually surprised that I am giving this an 8/10. In fact, this anime probably has all the cliche characters of every anime combined. The tsundere girl, the quiet girl, the playboy, the... uhhh.... slut. Yeah, and there's even more where that came from. But there's always a character for everyone to relate to, even though they aren't that deep. Maybe it's not worth an 8 here, but I guess this cliche cast really got to me.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nObviously since Zero is a romance comedy shounen-ish anime, the enjoyment value is going to shoot the technical values in the face. The way the story is executed is very fun to watch, and the &quot;I want to confess but I can't&quot; moments are perfectly spread and executed. It's hard to get that kind of a story right, especially with all the animes out there that have flopped and given this stereotypical plotline a bad name. The comedy is great as well, I found myself laughing out loud at some moments and laughing when I knew what was coming (trust me, you will also.)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat more can I say? If you're into the romance comedy genre, I highly suggest you pick this up. One of my main concerns in the beginning was how childish it looked, but then I figured out the characters are supposed to be 16 (they look way younger... ?_?). Anyway, I would say if you don't like this anime within the first 3 episodes, this isn't for you. But please, just give it a try.",

            "content": "Shout-out to Dilan-sama for which this magnificent review is for!\r\nMAL users prepare your collective anus for what is possible the longest and most rantiest review you will ever read. \r\nThe first half of the review, the episode deconstructions,  should only be read by those who have actually watched the show since it won't make sense otherwise.\r\n******************\r\nDISCLAIMERS!\r\n******************\r\n- Do NOT take this review 100% seriously. While I will say that I personally hated it, it is completely fine if you do like it! I am only poking a bit of fun into, IMO, a very badly written story.\r\n- Do NOT read if you do not wantedto be spoiled since this is extremely spoiler heavy.\\n\\n\r\n- Do NOT read if you do not like profanity since the review is covered with it. \\n\\n\r\n- This isn't really a disclaimer but more of heads up. Since this review is huge there will be grammar mistake and stuff so please forgive me!\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode one\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tMain character is retarded. His reaction for being abducted is very calm and abnormal. \\n\r\n\u2022\tHe gets thrown the main chicks clothes and presumes its seduction, then acts like a retard (seriously what was he doing?).\\n\r\n\u2022\tHe just sort of stands about having been abducted, his thoughts contradict his actions.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWhy is everyone already an asshole in this show, so a human is forcibly made into  familiar without consent and everyone is OK with that no questions asked.\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe main chick is fucking insane. She is just platinum mad for no reason.\\n\r\n\u2022\tOf course she has to kiss him to seal the ritual. Well lots of things wrong with this. Firstly why was this not explained/shown beforehand? And why a kiss? To make their relationship deep and shit?\\n\r\n\u2022\tWhy was the teacher not informed of the crazy chick beforehand? Why should the teacher just expect to believe her students for no good reason other than it won\u2019t end well?\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo only after he understands her words he decides to run away instead of asking for help/guidance, logical. O and he comes past one obstacle and the first thing he does is crawl. You have to be stupid to think that would work. It also undermines his whole situation. Does he take being held captive by a \u201ccult\u201d as a joke?\\n\r\n\u2022\t So the asshole with the rose starts levitating the main guy. What a dick. I mean that is one scared human (I think?) and he just playing him like he is some trash. Do the people not understand he is fucking human?\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode two\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo the main character is chained up. Firstly I have to question the ethics and humanity of Louise since she clearly gives no fucks about our main guy. She seems mentally unstable, after all she go into fits of massive rage and treats her own species like shit. Like would you even treat a familiar like this, even it wasn\u2019t human?\\n\r\n\u2022\tNow she starts striping in front of him again. Ok so why does she think of him as a familiar and not human since he looks human and kind of acts like one? Does she have no shame? Also how does she expect him to wash her clothes if he is chained up?\\n\r\n\u2022\tO and our main guy once again shows us that he does not take the situation seriously (he has been taken away against his will) by just acting like an idiot when is throw some panties.\\n\r\n\u2022\tAlso the main guy is a submissive little bitch.\\n\r\n\u2022\tLouise won't even dress herself. I mean that really is the epitome of lazy\\n\r\n\u2022\tMain guy seems to have adapted pretty well to the surrounding. I mean if it were me I would try everything to get the fuck away if I were being held AGAINST MY WILL but that\u2019s just me you know. Also does this guy not care about his family? He has not even thought about them. What a guy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tBlonde rose guy again shows us his assholely when we find out he is dating two women at once. God is everyone in this show like this? I mean I have still to find one character that is likable.\\n\r\n\u2022\tShounen power for the win. Got to have those cheesy speeches before you fight you know.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI also like how convenient it is for his powers to start working. So how much plot armour do you have? I\u2019m betting a lot.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSee more evidence that Louise is indeed mentally insane. She now has no problem taking care of him even though only at the start of the episode she was convinced he was just a familiar. Like what exactly changed? Because he had a fight with a \u201cnoble\u201d and THAT made him look more human?\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode three\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tTsundere bitch. \\n\r\n\u2022\tWell I mean I was already pretty sure but our main character is of course a pervert. How original. How edgy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tAnd I shit you not I think I have experienced the most cringe worthy \u201csong\u201d ever. Like you can tell the writer but a lot of thought into that. Also even our main guy is a dick.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWOW. Main guy so smart. His thought process \u201cOK so she has let me off the hook so I think I will continue to make fun of her even though she is crazy and risk not getting food\u201d. Our hero, what a guy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI had a feeling red hair chick was easy but really you want to bang that guy? I mean you have spoken to guy like once and you already want his dick? Makes sense.\\n\r\n\u2022\tThis show is yoke right? She is in love with him? Kiddingz me?\\n\r\n\u2022\tThis show never amazes me\u2026 that is all.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo not only is blond rose guy a cheating bastard but this bitch as well? Whelp.\\n\r\n\u2022\tThis Louise character is truly a bitch. So after taking him away from red hair slut she proceeds to tell him she is going to treat him like a dog rather than human. HOLY SHIT. She has yet to treat him like a proper human thus far having chained him, eat food off the floor, etc. If she thinks that this is how a human should be treated she is utterly out of her mind.\\n\r\n\u2022\tNow she starts whipping him. This bitch needs to die. She is just awful to the people around her. I mean the reason doesn't even make sense, he is late due to something completely out of his control and she is \u201cjealous\u201d so she whips him. The writer is doing a great job hear making us hate all these assholes.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSeriously you\u2019re going to put your hands there on her chest rather than her stomach? Like are you retarded?\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo both of these chicks kick him the face when he says even something a little bit out of line. What a good way to show their love.\\n\r\n\u2022\tAlso I\u2019m pretty sure they are both complete idiots. The sword starts talking smack and they assume it\u2019s him even though it sounds NOTHING like him. How smart.\\n\r\n\u2022\t These characters have no redeeming qualities. Main dude is a pervert, he is an asshole, and he complains a lot, retarded and one indecisive bastard.\\n\r\n\u2022\tLouise is a tsundere\u2026 I have nothing more to add even though I could.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode four\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe bouncing boob sound. This show is truly classy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo the maid is of course one of those people with low self-esteem until our main guy comes along. Like really I\u2019m sure you would continue absolutely fine without him. After all there is nothing to suggest that you couldn't.  After all the world building has been extremely poor so far. I know next to nothing about how anything works.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo our main guy know red head like him but still chooses to go into her room. If you are not going to give her the goofballs then why go in at all. Like to like to see her tease you but then be like \u201cna fuck you bitch gunna now do the same thing to your rival\u201d. What a guy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tO shit drama. Maid now has work for someone else and main guy, knowing her for only a few days will of course do something.\\n\r\n\u2022\tTypical bad guy who is a dick for no reason. \\n\r\n\u2022\tI like how the main guy just waltz into red head slut\u2019s room and demands her treasure, explains nothing then goes into a fit of rage. Smart guy I swear guys.\\n\r\n\u2022\tMuch romance. So deep. Shame this guy gives no fucks.\\n\r\n\u2022\tThis main guy is hard to watch. Why does he just go into any situation head first without thinking about shit? He irresponsible and selfish. Nearly got bitch punished which he seems to care for so much (even though she is a bitch).\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode five\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\t\u201cI could wash your panties live\u201d \u2013 That main dude\\n\r\n\u2022\tSeriously though he is either retarded if he is serious or a masterful troll. I\u2019m going to bet on the former.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo my understanding is that ALL the jokes are basically sex/echhi ones. God at least try to be original. I\u2019m going to bet that they going to beat a dead horse to death with these jokes.\\n\r\n\u2022\tYes! More harem bait in the form of the princess\u2026 didn't see that one coming.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo queen and bitch meet each other brace each other and state they are friends and only then does main guy ask \u201cdo you know each other?. Well of course they fucking do, they just said so!\\n\r\n\u2022\tHow can no one notice the massive fucking golem? I everyone blind?\\n\r\n\u2022\tHow am I supposed to take this show seriously when it trying to have a plot. OK so where the fuck are the guards when the golem attacked? Why can bitch break through the barrier being a n00b while the golem cannot? \\n\r\n\u2022\tIt\u2019s not your responsibility bitch buts it\u2019s not the guards either since we don\u2019t have any\u2026\\n\r\n\u2022\tEnd episode with clich\u00e9 #5923. You know the old I didn't run away because otherwise I wouldn't be an \u2018insert relevant\u2019 otherwise.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode six\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tYhh bitch don\u2019t even think about being nice to my familiar. O familiar I\u2019m going to hit you for not rejecting one the few people who are nice to you. I mean god why doesn't the main guy understand? Because I certainly don\u2019t.\\n\r\n\u2022\tOK. Time to use the logic hammer. So the princess is going too held accountable because of the lack security around the academy and it being around the princess. OK so security must be outright bad since whoever decided to concentrate the guards in a single area is retarded. Like someone could just come from the side, the sky or some angle and give her the deaths. What is stopping them since no one would see them until it\u2019s too late.  After all a fucking GIANT GOLEM was only noticed when it made a huge crack in the wall. And why would the princess be held accountable. Doesn't she have someone who deals with guard formations and whatnot? Why would they make her do it?\\n\r\n\u2022\tWait so they just let red slut into the meeting no questions asked? Doesn't she have like a class to attend? \\n\r\n\u2022\tOMFG. So the headmaster asks who wants to go after the thief and of course those more suited for the job decline like pussies but agrees for the STUDENTS to go. Wtf what if they die? Will the headmaster just be like \u201co well\u201d. I\u2019d be OK with this if any effective world building had been established. But through the stuff I've seen so far this just seems completely retarded.\\n\r\n\u2022\tLol that justification for letting them go after her. Ok by my logic Louise shouldn't go since she can\u2019t do magic and is a massive liability. Headmaster states that he has HEARD slut is good at fire magic. So what? You\u2019re going to let her go on hearsay? And from what I have seen her fire magic is no match vs golem. And I can\u2019t comment shy girl since she is bland as all hell. We are TOLD she is a knight (how dull) so I guess that means she is good to go. \\n\r\n\u2022\tGod those boob shots. Please have mercy on me. Common misconception (probably not to those reading) but boobs of that size and magnitude are actually just distracting rather than attractive. Like 1/7 would not fap.\\n\r\n\u2022\tOK so they go into the shed/house thingy to check for clues/staff and proceed to not check\u2026 apart from shy girl. So main guy and slut and fucking useless but hey shy girl good job. You\u2019re like the only character to not piss me off.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo Tony appears and wreaks shit up and they attack it to no avail. Was I surprised? Of course not, their attacks where going to be fucking useless. \\n\r\n\u2022\tSo bitch just stands their makes a silly speech about what it means to be a noble because of some pride she has. Is she stupid?  Her pride nearly got her killed if it wasn't for our plot armoured Saito (main guy = Saito).\\n\r\n\u2022\tHoly shit. Main guy bitch slapped bitch. I have no complaints. 7/7\\n\r\n\u2022\tShe claims that she will be made fun of if she runs. She is mentally unstable I know but come on you would rather die than live and be made fun of a little?\\n\r\n\u2022\tFucking shuonen fights. So boring if you know they no chance of losing in the slightest.\\n\r\n\u2022\tO man that twist. Shame I give no shits about her or the people she is trying to kill. Also how did she go from bitch to evil bitch with basically no foreshadowing other than HAIR COLOUR?\\n\r\n\u2022\tAnd we don\u2019t even get to find out why she stole the dam thing. Real.\\n\r\n\u2022\tFuck off main guy you have barely even tried to get back home so stop being so sad fuck one those harem girls you have. Jeez.\\n\r\n\u2022\tYou are a fucking liar you do not want to go back home so shut your whore mouth.\\n\r\n\u2022\tDoes this guy enjoy being someone\u2019s servant? I, for the life of me, cannot figure out why he likes her or being a familiar since he is treated mostly like trash.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode 7\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo the episode immediately starts off retarded with our main guy misunderstanding a kiss on the hand for kiss on the lip. Like bitch clearly stated kiss her on the hand. I mean this interaction isn\u2019t even abnormal from the planet he comes from dammit.\\n\r\n\u2022\tAround 7:10 seconds. Why does this exist?\\n\r\n\u2022\tPlease Dilan-sama have mercy on my soul. I don\u2019t even know anymore.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo the slut who washes the dishes wants his dick already. Why?!?  What about this guy makes all women want to fuck him. So according to outside sources this guy is a 4/7 on the \u201cwould you bang\u201d scale. I don\u2019t think a 4 warrants all these girls wanting his penis.\\n\r\n\u2022\tMore assholes again. Of course the tax collector is just a dick for no reason other than to make Saito look like he actually cares.\\n\r\n\u2022\t\u201cI\u2019m the only one who is allowed to touch Louise\u201d #Creepy #ThisStillSoundsCreepyWithContext\\n\r\n\u2022\tO shit what a tense cliff-hanger. I\u2019m am literally on the edge of my seat. /sarcasm\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode eight\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tO look the boob groping \u201cjoke\u201d while riding a horse. I swear they used that already\u2026 I will tell you what is wrong with this. Firstly holding someone\u2019s chest rather than their stomach is just awkward while riding a horse so it makes no sense from a functional point of view. Also you are that much of a fucking pervert that you can just touch her pancakes. What a dick. This is actually one of the view times I am OK with her giving him abuse. Asshole deserves it.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWho hugs likes that\u2019s? Just seems uncomfortable.\\n\r\n\u2022\tJust a general thought not related to the episode, I still think that tsundere bitch is completely broken in the head and the way she treats main guy is evil but I think I at least understand some of her anger. This guy is completed retarded and unlikable so I can get the rage. \\n\r\n\u2022\tSo bitch has the most obvious feelings for main guy and is in utter denial. I am both understanding and totally confused. So does she actually realise she likes him or are her words not representative of her thoughts? Why does she like him? He is selfish asshole and is boring and unfunny. I mean hell, bitch herself probably abuses him for some of these reasons.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWait shy girl and slut are actually friends? Is this real life? Why? They seem to have absolutely nothing common nor do they even speak much to each other unless she is needed for the plot.\\n\r\n\u2022\tGawd, trying to use the sad story tactic huh? Seems grossly out of place in a light-hearted anime about boobs. I mean this will probably go nowhere and shy girl will only serve as more harem bait. Also this scene wasn't very impactful as it just kind of happened out of the blue with basically no foreshadowing. Like everything just seems to blown way out proportion with the music and crazy mum.\\n\r\n\u2022\tHOLD THE FUCK UP. Am I missing something or did I just go full retard? Did the mother of the shy girl drink that potion of mind rape knowing it would mind rape her? Why did she simply not throw is away? She clearly knew it was bad since she took it away from her daughter so why did she herself drink it? This make absolutely no sense what so ever.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWait she can beat a three-headed dragon but not a golem? And without a familiar? Much consistent, so logic.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI think one wanting a bath\u2026 or for that matter keeping ones self-clean is universal to the human race not just the Japanese. Do you think the rest of us just roll around in the dirt? And yes this is such an insignificant thing but fuck this guy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe maid is too fucking docile. Like really do you not understand the concept of bubbles? Could you not foresee someone being in that water? And why stand that close anyway?\\n\r\n\u2022\tHe\u2019s having a fucking bath what do you think he is doing? It\u2019s not hard to piece together.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWait a second! Did maid put bath in quotations as to question what a bath actually is? Baths and washing ones-self exists in this word right? \\n\r\n\u2022\tOK didn\u2019t she have a pot to transport? Was she like well I\u2019ve broken it so I can stop working now? She is just going to leave it there? Also main guy if you don\u2019t intend to give her the goofballs then man up and tell her to gtfo because toying with her (since you know she likes you) is a dick move.\\n\r\n\u2022\tAnd he upset bitch. What a guy. He likes her right (I\u2019m assuming he must since this a predictable harem/echhi show)? Why does he fuck around with women he is not interested right?\\n\r\n\u2022\tNot really sneaking if you rage talk to yourself out loud. Also isn\u2019t talking to yourself like that a sign of mental instability? Telling you guys she is mad in the head.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo knowing that bitch is in \u201clove\u201d with main guy, even if it was accidental, will main guy do? I\u2019m guessing he will mess around for a bit a toy with her some more. That is our main protagonist friends.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode nine\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tOK so this is a love comedy magic fantasy things so I get love potions a one those things that just exist in these kind of settings but is just seems highly unethical to use one of these things. Doesn\u2019t forcing someone to love you beat the whole of someone loving you? And with consent? Also why does blond girl want blond rose guy to even like her? I got the impression she hated him? Since you know he is a dick to her.\\n\r\n\u2022\tO gawd everything this blond guy says sounds like it came out of an 80\u2019s cheesy romance movie (not that I have ever watched one, just speculation on my part). He is basically as 1 d as you get. His personality is a potato.\\n\r\n\u2022\tHonestly I think one of things that most annoys about this anime is how its setting has potential. So you basically could explore a massive amounts of things/themes within the setting like social classes and mage rankings. You could also have that conflicting theme between choosing the people you have come to love in one world over the people you love in another. You also could have a had a theme on how difficult it is to adapt to a new setting when you are so used to an old one and how those people around you can help you. It also could have had a theme of what is more important in this world: being human or familiar? How sad\\n\r\n\u2022\tReal! Love potions are forbidden by law. So how did blond bitch get a hold of one? Does she not care both the law and human ethics?  She seems a like a pretty horrid person.\\n\r\n\u2022\tBlond girl doesn\u2019t even look like she cares she forced some to love someone else without consent (this sounds stupid but it forbidden by law no?). \\n\r\n\u2022\tI like how they can leave the academy no one even cares/notices. Like they have places which they stay in so I assume they are supposed to stay on campus right? I mean don\u2019t get me wrong if you want to leave campus no one should be allowed to stop you but isn\u2019t it board daylight so wont classes be on? They are going to be punished for skipping class\u2019 right?\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe \u201ccomedy\u201d is so bad in this show. I don\u2019t really like to judge shows on comedy since I don\u2019t understand Japanese comedy but this is just outright bad. So blond guy is \u201cdrowning\u201d right and unlike any normal person he just continues to flap around like a retard other than just swimming to the edge since it literally like a meter away. Also can\u2019t he just levitate himself out of water or something? \\n\r\n\u2022\tHas main guy killed before? He seems awfully ok with just killing a bunch of people for a tear. Given they are probably a bunch of assholes but I know I wouldn\u2019t want killing a bunch of people on my conscious. Unless I\u2019m misinterpreting eradicate for another meaning other than kill then this guy is an even bigger asshole than I could have ever though he would be.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI don\u2019t understand the love potion. So let us assume the only thing the potion does is make someone fall in love with you and nothing else is changed. Bitch already was in love with the main guy\u2026 the only difference of not being affected with a love potion is that she was unable to share her feelings. Now that she can share her feeling why does she act completely different? She should still have that same bitchy personality but know she is just clingy and paranoid. A love potion shouldn\u2019t cause her to have an entirely different personality.\\n\r\n\u2022\tMain guy treats bitch like she is 3 or something. \u201cBe a good girl and stay there.\u201d How condescending can you be? She is probably around the same age as you.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWait a second was that a\u2026 decent plot twist? Don\u2019t get me wrong everything is so shitty at this point that I can\u2019t feel happy about but it was foreshadowed last episode so I don\u2019t feel completely cheated it was them. Still though, shit characters and awful plot still make this bad moment. There is still NO tension or drama so it is just\u2026 disappointing \\n\r\n\u2022\tI feel like this is a little too serious over a fucking love potion in a comedy romance anime.\\n\r\n\u2022\tIt\u2019s one of those intense cliff-hangers guys. The mysterious man is named Cromwell, o shiiit.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode ten\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tSee this is what annoys me. We have these \u201cGermania\u201d and yet we know nothing about them. So how am I supposed to feel when she tells bitch this? I take it that this is bad since she clearly doesn\u2019t want to get married but honestly I feel nothing. I know nothing of Germania or the fucking country they live in. \\n\r\n\u2022\tThis entire scene is out of place. To my understanding this show is a comedy harem show not a show with a plot and characters that matter. Like why would I care about any of the stuff they are talking about? Even for those who like the show this scene is just weird. I don\u2019t know about any of the politics or nations or anything and the writers have decided to show us the worst way possible\u2026 by telling us rather than showing us. How am supposed to feel like any of this has meaning if I don\u2019t get to see/experience it? How am I supposed to know Germania is really \u201cbarbaric\u201d?\\n\r\n\u2022\tWell of course our main guy has the most powerful element: void. How exciting.\\n\r\n\u2022\tClich\u00e9 #4128 \u201cYou know, I will protect you\u201d speech. I mean really now does such a thing have to be said? Shouldn\u2019t it be a given that you protect her. I mean you might want to just reinsure her but could you have done it in a less cheesy fashion?\\n\r\n\u2022\tAgain lack of foreshadowing has prevented any potential drama and interest from happening. This Ward-sama has come out of nowhere and is bitch\u2019s husbando to be. Only problem with this is there was no build up or tension so I don\u2019t really care. I also know that things will just resolve in nice knotted bow so yhh.\\n\r\n\u2022\tHe is a nice guy huh? I bet you haven\u2019t even had a conversation with him yet so you know not enough to make such an assumption. \\n\r\n\u2022\tWait just a second? NO guy would do what this does if he didn\u2019t want to give bitch the goofballs. Lying bastard.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI could be totally wrong and I legitimately mean it but I\u2019m going to put money that ward-sama is not a nice guy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI think another reason I don\u2019t care they are getting married is that main guy doesn\u2019t actually care. So why are they making a big thing out of it? Would be way more interesting if main guy actually tried to fight for Louise\u2019s love.\\n\r\n\u2022\tMuch drama. So original. 7/7 would watch again\\n\r\n\u2022\tWhy are they suddenly fighting? This has come out of nowhere. No logical build up or anything. This makes no sense. What even is logic?\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo main guy loses to Ward-sama and Ward-sama is like you are unable to protect bitch. While I agree somewhat with that statement it is still a little off. Firstly how to expect some teenager to beat you? It\u2019s not exactly fair is it now. Also just because he lost to you doesn\u2019t mean he will lose to others. He beat a golem your statement \u201cyou are unable to protect bitch\u201d is inaccurate.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode eleven\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tHe is crying? WHY?!? Are you just a giant pussy because you got beat in a fight you agreed to?\\n\r\n\u2022\tThis guy just makes me even more fucking mad. This is actually one of the most awful characters I have ever seen. Even when bitch tries to cheer him up he just acts like a little emo bitch. Get over yourself and grow some balls.\\n\r\n\u2022\tO no Tony is back. Also really the clich\u00e9d #5331 evil laugh for no apparent reason.\\n\r\n\u2022\tThis Ward-sama is fucking creepy. Why does he feel the need to whisper I will protect you into her ear? She not only heard you the first time but if you really felt the need to tell her again wouldn\u2019t you have done it in a more normal way? A way that makes you seems less creepy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tFUCK OFF! ALL CAPS MODE ON! WHERE THE FUCK DID RED SLUT AND SHY GIRL COME FROM. WHY ARE THEY HERE? HOW DID THEY KNOW WHERE TO COME FROM? AND WHAT VERY CONVIENT TIMING!\\n\r\n\u2022\tAttacking from the side lol. She very clearly attacked you from the front. Mad coz bad?\\n\r\n\u2022\tYou yoking me? She can just jump into the air and teleport off. Amazing. \\n\r\n\u2022\tHow the fuck could red slut find out where they went? The only people who knew about the trip where the princess and those on the trip. So who could she have asked to find out? It couldn\u2019t have been princess since she must have left as soon as she was done. Was it magic because that would be waaaay to convenient? And just because she said it took her all day to find out does not make it a valid reason. \\n\r\n\u2022\tMain guy again being an asshole. He asks a question the inn keeper and he answers him. And only because the answer was not specific enough he has to throw a fit and slams the desk. What a guy. \\n\r\n\u2022\tReal. She somehow heard Saito\u2019s voice over an impossibly huge distance. I guess that makes their relationship deep and shit now?\\n\r\n\u2022\tLol. \u201cThere is no one here\u201d Suddenly 10 guards in front of your face. How could you miss them?\\n\r\n\u2022\tWhat? Now there is a war? And an organization pulling the strings? You are just making this shit as you go along aren\u2019t you?\\n\r\n\u2022\tFUCKING CALLED IT! Ward-sama is a bad man. How predictable can this show get!\\n\r\n\u2022\tAnd they make bitch in need of help. Clich\u00e9 #1 \u201cDamsel in distress\u201d. If you\u2019re going to you use this please add something original otherwise you are a complete failure of a show.\\n\r\n\u2022\tPls no more cheese in my face. Pls no more extremely convenient timings or clich\u00e9 dialog.\\n\r\n\u2022\tO no you killed the guy that only have 2 mins of screen time! Masterful writing and timing. What a twist! Seriously though how do expect me to feel anything for this guy? I couldn\u2019t care less since I don\u2019t even know who he is.\\n\r\n\u2022\tRight so this guy just wants to marry bitch for her personality? WHY??? Explanations are in order right? It would make sense if you wanted to marry her for political power or something but this just makes no sense.\\n\r\n\u2022\tJesus penis more ass pulls. Suddenly he has the power to absorb magic and make his sword stronger for no reason other than heart power? Why bother have him fight at all if he is just going to auto win? It\u2019s like playing a game on very easy when you have already completed the game on normal. Like why play the game on very easy at that point. You already know how to play the dam thing.\\n\r\n\u2022\t\u201cIf we linger why any longer we are done for\u201d say that while lingering. Why don\u2019t you just move then?\\n\r\n\u2022\tOK so they kiss at the end. I kind of don\u2019t mind this since it\u2019s not in your face and shiz. Shame the characters, setting, and everything about the show sucks. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode twelve\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tI don\u2019t think you can take full responsibility here. How about the people who hired Ward to be the guide. Surely it was there job to ensure that he would fulfil he his duties and that the fact he was unable to shows they hired the wrong person. \\n\r\n\u2022\tI like how the show is regressing rather than progressing. At this point the climax to the finale should be getting bigger. Why the episode has started with more echhi/tsundere shenanigans is beyond me. Why is it slowing down with only two episodes to go?\\n\r\n\u2022\tI fucking hate main guy. The asshole kisses bitch then acts like nothing happened. Why is he in denial? Also at this point he MUST know bitch likes him. So why does he just run off with maid and not explain anything to bitch? You are at the very least friends so the least you could do is explain why you are leaving. Jeez\\n\r\n\u2022\tExplain to main guy why is it ok that you don\u2019t tell her? It\u2019s not like you had to go right then and there I\u2019m sure she would have given you time to talk to bitch.\\n\r\n\u2022\tOK so it\u2019s going to be like that huh? You\u2019re going to deny that you like bitch for whatever reason. You writers make me sick, just making main guy be in denial for no logical reason other than to keep this haram shit going. Pls stop writing.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWhy does he look like he actually wants to go back home? This guy has barely said or done anything to even try to get back. I\u2019m sorry but he is just a walking contradiction.\\n\r\n\u2022\tMore random sad moments that come out of nowhere! So the princess was in love the prince? Where did this come from? And why should I care? I barely knew either of the characters.\\n\r\n\u2022\tHow do expect him to mass produce gasoline if he doesn\u2019t even know what it is? Do you even know how it\u2019s made? Because given the technology this world has it seems to be it would be pretty hard to obtain.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nLast episode\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tWeird that they add a bunch of new sound effects to the OP of the last episode. I don\u2019t really get it since they sound out of place since it doesn\u2019t flow well with the sound already there.\\n\r\n\u2022\t\u201cI will take command of our military\u201d \u2013 Princess. OK time to use the logic hammer again. So the show has failed to present anything that would suggest you would be good at commanding an army. If anything the anime has suggested you would be an awful candidate for such a job. After all remember when that golem attacked the academy and you thought it would be a good idea to concentrate all your troops into one super dense area so you didn\u2019t even know you were being attacked? It seems to be you are horrible at strategy and tactics. GG WP!\\n\r\n\u2022\tNotice how half of his memories are ones of either abuse or sadness with bitch. See how their relationship is mostly artificial with no real weight? \\n\r\n\u2022\tThat is the most underwhelming invasion I have seen. One ship? Kiddingz me?\\n\r\n\u2022\tThat outfit the princess is wearing seems pretty impractical. What is she going to do? Seduce her enemies to death (which to be fair might not be the worst plan\u2026)? \\n\r\n\u2022\tOK I thought the invading parties numbers where underwhelming but the defending side is a joke. How am I supposed to take this war seriously? Also why the fuck is bitch there? She can\u2019t possible defend herself against trained soldiers. Won\u2019t she be a massive liability?\\n\r\n\u2022\tWhy is blond rose guy still in his uniform? This show is retarded.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI have no more yoke to give. I don\u2019t understand anymore. The impracticability of both flying a plane and using his sword at the same time. \\n\r\n\u2022\tWhere are the defending sides\u2019 mages? Don\u2019t they have any? Why is just Tony a problem?\\n\r\n\u2022\tEven more retarded stuff. Why doesn\u2019t she make a new golem? Why was she not burned to deaths since she was covered in the oil?\\n\r\n\u2022\tWard-sama has map awareness of a potato. Isn\u2019t this guy to be an elite fighter? Why didn\u2019t he see that dragon attack coming from a mile away?\\n\r\n\u2022\tOf course Loiuse happens to be super op and have the most broken magic in the world. How interesting. See this is just boring since we know that it\u2019s just bound to work with no consequence. \\n\r\n\u2022\tDid bitch just mass murder everyone on the opposing side? Given the attacking side where a bunch of dicks and I don\u2019t think they had a chance to surrender but still\u2026\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo after all he has been saying about how badly he wants to get home he fucking doesn\u2019t? FUCK OFF! You lying piece of shit. I guess this is just a middle finger to your family huh? \u201cO sorry guys I\u2019d rather flirt with a bunch of girls than be with my family\u201d. Our fucking hero, what a guy!\\n\r\n\u2022\tClich\u00e9 villain is beaten just like that. What an ending you know. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSince I have a lot to conclude I will divide the conclusion into multiple sections.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSo this is where most of the problems lie in this show. A decent show at least depends on characters that are likable and this show has no likable characters. I will deconstruct the ones that matter and give my opinion on how they can be improved.\\n\\n\r\nSaito - This is possible the worst character of this show... or of any show. He \\n\r\nfails even the most basic traits of a good character. He is not relatable in any \\n\r\nway having basically zero charisma, being an asshole for no reason, flirts around with a bunch of women even though he likes Louise and she likes him back, indecisive, rushes head first without thinking about it, etc.\\n\\n\r\nHe also doesn't care much about his family which he basically never mentions and never feel homesick yet always makes the claim that he wants to return home. Not only is this a contradiction but it makes him come a across as a heartless asshole. \\n\\n\r\nWhat the writers could have done IMO is have him talk a little bit about his family. This would not only make him come across as a more likeable and relateable guy but actually proves that he wants to go back home.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLouise - Her character is just a complete and utter mess. I don't like the tsundere archetype since these people don't actually exist in real life so its hard to relate to them however if character development/history is explored and developed enough then that is perfectly acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nHer tsundere ways are, however, not even remotely explained so she just comes across as a crazy bitch. Had the writer just been bothered to give even a small explanation then her character might have been bearable. And personally I would have toned down the crazy a bit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNo other characters are worth talking about since they are just 1-D cardboard cutouts.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for characters is 1/10. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe story is abysmal if you can even call it a story. The structure and flow and completely nonsensical. It basically does its own thing when it likes and how it likes it. Since I cant describe the story much beyond the synopsis because it is so random I will not bother.\\n\\n\r\nInstead I talk about how how the story could be improved. For one the story could actually have a sense of direction by using, for example, the goal of the protagonist to get home and his journey. It can also explain some of the themes its premise presented like social classes and mage rankings. You could also have that conflicting theme between choosing the people you have come to love in one world over the people you love in another. You also could have a had a theme on how difficult it is to adapt to a new setting when you are so used to an old one and how those people around you can help you. It also could have had a theme of what is more important in this world: being human or familiar? (taken from episode nine). By using these the story could be great!\\n\\n\r\nStory gets a 1/10\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nAnimation, art-style, sound, acting and all that jazz\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nHonestly all of this stuff was alright but not great. The animation was alright apart from the fights which where just very unimpressive and uninspired.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was kinda OK. Backgrounds where actually pretty decent  but character designs where mediocre. Saito's in particular was bad, just being very bland and generic just like his character. At least SAO had amazing visuals to make up for its awful writing. \\n\\n\r\nSound was decent. That is all. Voice acting was also decent. No one stood in particular but no one was bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.5\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nMy enjoyments/final thoughts\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAlright so I hated this anime but at the same time I also quite enjoyed it. Yup. It was fun ripping it apart and being honest I can kinda maybe understand if someone liked this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment gets a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason I rate the show so low is because of the potential it hard to better than the average with its intriguing setting and possibilities. But because it failed it has made me sad and mad.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gets a 1/7. WOULD NOT WATCH EVER AGAIN!!!!!! \\n",

An upcoming test at her academy requires her to summon a familiar, a servant and partner to support heras a magician. Despite desiring a familiar that would be superior to her constantly mocking classmates, Louise ends up summoning Hiraga Saito, a Japanese boy. The story of this season was good a bit of plot holes, some things didn't make sense and the pacing was ok, the thing is that is almost the same thing in every episode, where Louise just beats Saito for almost anything, only in the last ones the things get interesting, overall is good.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe art style is good, nothing to be amazed of, the characters are well done but could have been better, the voice acting is good and the background music is not bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound was good, the music background too, the VA was very good so the soud overall was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe cast of characters can seem generic and bland, maybe for you not to care about them and are slow paced most of them, because there are four seasons they never go deep on this season with character development or back stories, just focused more on Louise and Saito and to allow them to get closer, even tho they fight a lot and disagree with each other. Good characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt was good but i expected more from this season, but i don't mind a lot because there are 3 seasons left.",

            "content": "!Spoilers but you will need to read this b4 you watch 100%!\r\nOK, so i could write a complicated review about why i disliked this so much, but im to lazy to do that so here it goes\r\nStory: Fk of\r\nDude gets pulled out of some dimensional arse, and is just told to deal with it. AND HE FKING DOES. Well ok, but then he becomes the servant of some little bitch, AND HE AGAIN SEEMS TO BE OK WITH IT. And she treats him like an animal, not a human for some odd reason i cant wrap my mind around. Then there's all of a suddenthis Void magic, and MC is apparently the familiar of the only void mage ever, even though he just got pulled out of the arse. But they apparently think we wouldn't realize. Its so dumb that it hurts. The most original part of this was either the slut or the pedo tbh.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe only good looking character is the red haired Slutty chick, so that's that but not so bad i guess.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI wanted to kill myself after hearing the dub, so i went sub. BUT I GOT FKING SURPRISED WHEN THAT WAS EVEN WORSE. The bitch sounds like a 4th grader who has parents with more money then fking Justin Biber.(and she sounds like a fan of him) aka garbage get out of my face.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:Ok, wtf. \\n\r\nIt was so fking hard to watch after like ep 8 and i kinda began to hate it... Mostly because of the Bitch, and the MC. Mc clearly loves the flat chested bitch for some odd reason, even though he has someone like fking Siesta and that just pissed me of so god damn much. He's a fiking pussy for not fking that red haired hot chick, who actually was nice to him and offered it multiple times. Then they at the end get a fking moment and he forgets that he wanted to fking leave. Like cmon. And why i didn't just run away from such a dumb bitch is beyond me tbh. He like, legit just got pulled out of his everyday life by some bitch and he accepts it. jesus fk i hate him.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the ungrateful bitch who takes MC for granted and legit abuses him daily. MC puts up with her bs and does not give a fk, which also blows my mind. She loves him aswell obviously but shes still a stuck up little bitch against him. She legit makes him sleep on the fking floor, like are you dumb he has saved you multiple times and is a OG badass(and pussy) but you treat him like garbage. Fk of ya dumb cunt. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI enjoyed watching hentai more then this, not just pleasure but all around liked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nSuck my dick, i wanna die.\\n",

            "content": "I enjoy a good romcom every once and a while, and if it can be combined with another genre to create more or better situations, then all the better right?  A situation, setting, and characters can make a romcom really good, even if it's taking an old concept and adding in a new element.  \r\nSo we get Zero no Tsukaima.  the story of a noble mage from a magical realm and her familiar, a human from our world.  Sounds like a good mash-up like Inuyasha, Shakugan no Shana, or any of the many magical girlfriend animes out there.  The problemis, this series, though it combines familiar elements to make something new, it does not seem to work well.  While I loved Baka to Test for combining slice of life high school drama with monster training, this simply did not do it for me.  To be honest, Zero came off as cut and pasted together, with nothing really original to offer.  \\n\\n\r\nPlot:  Louise is a mage in training in her second year who must summon a familiar as part of her curriculim/rite of passage.  In what seems to be a freak accident, Louise summons a normal boy from our world in moddern Japan.  Hilarity ensues?  \\n\\n\r\nMost of the plot revolves around Louise and the boy, Saito's relationship.  Saito struggles with wanting to go home, Louise struggles to prove herself a strong and capable mage, and the two go on various missions together.  Oh, yeah, and boobs.  It seems at every twist and turn there is some woman with a large chest who is inexplicably attracted to Saito.  Misunderstandings ensue and Louise whips Saito with a riding crop in an attempt at slapstick comedy.  Besides, we've seen this in almost every other romcom harem comedy.  Boy meets girl, boy sees other girl in suggesgive situation, original girl beats ever loving crap out of boy.  This might be funny once or twice, but the joke repeats, and repeats and repeats on a loop throughout the whole series.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  And when a relationship does start to develop between Saito and Louise, Saito still seems to be interested in other girls.  Rather than using this for actual conflict or drama, it results in, yep, more whipping.  No development of their relationship, no understanding, just whipping.  Louise doesn't even bother switching up punishments, or using other gags as punishment.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the magical school element, many have compared this to Harry Potter.  I would sooner compare it to The Worst Witch.  In a magical school, Mildred Hubble is the worst witch, unable to perform even the most basic spells and earned the nickname 'Worst Witch' from her peers, and later discovers she, in her own way, is in fact quite powerul.  Sound familiar?\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes a turn about halfway through and tries to add in a little political intrigue.  Tries.  In the end, it doesn't really accomplish the backstabbing, coat and dagger politics of Last Exile or Le Chevalier D'Eon.  They seem to be trying, adding in familiar, historical and mythological elements to the story.  Unfortunately, they are often full of holes, poorly executed, or seem to come completely out of nowhere.  Let's take Tabitha for example.  The quiet bookworm friend of Louise's school rival Kirke is revealed to be a Princess from Gallia.  She might have inherited the throne too, if her father had not been murdered by a faction that wanted to put her father's brother on the throne instead.  Her uncle also wanted Tabitha out of the line of succession (which would not happen with Early modern primogeniture laws in which MALE heirs suceed) and one of his supporters tries to kill her via a glass of poison.  Her mother gets wind of it and...alright, seriously, if someone tries to poison your kid do you A) Take the poison away from her and use it as evidence to bring the bastard to justice  B) Take the poison away from her and dispose of it so everyone will be safe  C) Take the poison away from her and drink it youself inducing a lifetime of mental scars for your child and leaving her to fend for herself when you become and insane vegetable.  Tabitha's mother and parent of the year chose C.  Political intrigue?  Yes.  Well executed?  No, not really.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat really grates me about this series though is the History parallels.  Each country has an Early Modern European counterpart.  Gallia is France, Germania is Germany and Albion is England.  Might be original if I hadn't seen it in Trinity Blood first.  But in the Albion subplot, involving a revolution, involved elements that personally offended me as someone with Irish heritage.  \\n\\n\r\nA romcom with excessive panties and gags about boobs, brought up Oliver Cromwell.  \\n\\n\r\nNot Cromwell himself, but his equivalent in a parallel universe.  That still doesn't make it acceptable to me though.  Some might say I'm butthurt over something that happened hundreds of years ago, but this to me is serious.  Oliver Cromwell slaughtered 25-40% of Ireland's population, and became the closest thing to a military dictator England hand, led an ultra Puritain regime that banned Christmas, staughtered Catholics by the thousands, and these people had the absolute gall to turn him into a villain in an anime romcom focusing on panties and boobies.  Next time, let's imply something about Hitler, shall we?  \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound was something I kind of liked.  It was nothing special, but the European flavor brought out the exotic location well.  The J-pop opening was cute, and fitting with the cutesy style of the characters and the romantic comedy premis, and the ending seemed to sum up the character's feelings as well.  If you have a choice between sub and dub, pick sub.  The English voice track left a LOT to be desired.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art was reminissent of moe and seemed to have a slight influence from nineties fantasy anime like Escaflowne.  The animation was nothing mindblowing, but it stayed at a consistently good level throughout the whole series, never really dipping in quality.  Character designs are pretty standard.  There's the flat loly, her big breasted mature rival, the book worm, the playboy, the fat kid, the old wizard, the normal boy...we;ve seen them before, and honestly they did not try to do anything really new or unique in the character designs.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, they might as well been pulled out of a stock folder.  The young girl who has useless magic and turns out to be a sort of 'chosen one'.  The busty and sexually mature rival to the smaller girl who's main motivation is sex/love.  The bookworm with a tragic/interesting past who rarely speaks or socializes.  The playboy.  The perverted old man.  The normal everyman for otaku boys to project themselves on.  Villains whose main motivations are being evil for the sake of being evil (seriously, they take over a kingdom, and slaughter the royal family, and we have no idea WHY.  Also the Cromwell reference.  I won't forgive this series for that.)  None of the characters seem the least bit original, and their dialogue is completely cliched.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for Enjoyment, I know a lot of people like this series and I can see why.  There's something here that almost everyone can enjoy.  Girls can get into the romance, guys can like the fanservice and explosions.  At the same time though, it's all usually underdeveloped, cliched, or unexplored.  I suppose this might be covered in later seasons, but in this one, nothing really gets resolved.  The good guys save the day, but the show's main focus, Louise and Saito's relationship does not seem to have changed since day one.  Saito screws up, Louise beats him, end series.  For those who like the cliches, good for you and you will probably like this.  For me, I didn't, I explained why, and please respect that.  \\n\\n\r\nWarnings:  Panties galore, boobs, boob gags, mild language, character death, fighting, explosions, abusive relationship, reference to debatably genocidal miserable wretch of a human being who slaughtered my ancestors.",

            "content": "Story 3/10\r\nThe story starts in a magic school where the failure of a female lead summons our protagonist to be her familiar. A magic school is a wonderful ideal in theory however this is not used in any sort of effective manner. It uses magic in the story but only for minor bits of action and torturing Saito so it takes the fantasy out of it. It quickly devolves into a bland, tasteless harem comedy that really isn't even that funny. The characters have no really explored back-story and feel like they were picked out of a harem character pool of cliches.\r\nArt 6/10\r\nI have noreal complaints about the art. It doesn't blow you away but it's pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't bad and the OP was pretty good. The ending song however leaves much to be desired so the score takes a beating in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\nI would have given a lower score if it was possible. This score does not take into account voice actors.\\n\r\nFirst the protagonist, Saito, He has no depth to him at all. When he was being tortured he took it like it was no big deal and he had no real inclination to run away after the first time. He is then found to love the one character who treats him like crap.\\n\r\nNext we have the main female character, Louise, who is also said failure. She is a character with absolutely no good points whatsoever. She is without a doubt the worst main female character I have ever seen. She is advertised as a tsundere but we quickly find she is just a really horrible human being. She made the anime go from harem comedy to glorified torture porn, BDSM, etc. within two episodes. She tortures, starves, and verbally abuses him in a way that goes from funny to cringe-worthy in halfway into the second episode and it never really goes back to funny. She has tons of pride but no fighting ability whatsoever.  She makes herself fight all the time and then ends up having to be saved by the very guy she tortures on a daily basis.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters really only serve as a way to give Louise new reasons to torture said MC. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10\\n\r\nThe art and sound are decent but do nothing to make up for the story itself. The plot is boring and where sometimes cliched does not mean bad this story makes it worse. The characters though are what truly makes this story truly horrid.\\n\\n",

Big, smokey explosion. But she still managed to summon her familiar. However, it's not a cat, owl, dragon, or bugbear, but instead it's a human! Hiraga Saito, from our very own Japan even.

An upcoming test at her academy requires her to summon a familiar, a servant and partner to support her as a magician. Despite desiring a familiar that would be superior to her constantly mocking classmates, Louise ends up summoning Hiraga Saito, your average Japanese boy. Even with Louise and Saito both unwilling to accept each other, they have no choice. Louise cannot attemptanother summoning and Saito cannot return to Japan, and so their life together begins. Based on the novel by Noboru Yamaguchi.\\n\r\n(From MyAnimeList)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Opinion\\n\r\nI heard about this anime a little while back... though I wasn't completely sure if i wanted to see it or not. Finally, I was like &quot;what the hell&quot; and I decided to watch this.\\n\r\nIndeed the premise, opening, and photos seemed to promise a fun, comedic anime. And for all intesive purposes, it was. However... it wasn't as funny as i would've hoped. Some of the jokes tend not to work. Indeed, I kept thinking that this show would've been better if it had a bit more action to tie in with the jokes.\\n\r\nHowever, towards the end of the season, the action, character development, and comedy picked up and i really started to enjoy the show.\\n\r\nAs for things i liked, the biggest ones would be the voice actors. They're the same people from Shakugan no Shana.... so whenever Louise would yell at Saito, it was like a good deja vu.\\n\r\nAlso the animation is quite well suited for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlso as a note... there is a sequel series that has already aired. Zero no Tsukaima; Futatsuki no Kishi.\\n\r\nAnd a 3rd season is confirmed for the Spring 08 season\\n\\n\r\nOverall... enjoyable series... though fell a little short of expectations\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to...\\n\r\n- Shakugan no Shana\\n\r\nBoth the lead characters are girls, and they both have a hard time expressing their feeling for the main boy of the series. Also the same voice actors.\\n\\n\r\n- Fullmetal Alchemist\\n\\n\r\nBoth these animes had the parallel world idea, with one world being our own, and the other one having the ability of magic.\\n",

            "content": "I decided to watch Zero no Tsukaima because I wanted a leave-your-brain-out-of-the-equation sort of show, one I could sit back and watch without worrying about a negative outcome or depressing and/or disturbing complications. (Yes, for all my talk about artistic integrity and such, I do watch things for pure and simple fun sometimes.) Zero has most of that, but only to a point, and in the end I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of depth this show manages to pull out of nowhere. I went in expecting another Nanoha, or the first season of Shakugan no Shana all over again, and what I gotwas something more akin to the comedic romance and character development of Love Hina supported and sustained by the political intrigue of Last Exile or Simoun.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: An incompetent mage summons as her familiar a young man from contemporary Japan, and hilarity ensues. It isn't quite as simple as that, however. Despite an early focus on slapstick comedy, ecchi, and outright silliness, Zero quickly introduces a thin political thread, providing bits and pieces of flavor to make the world seem more alive. This thread smoothly escalates into a significant driving force of the show's events, perhaps more powerful, even, than the central romance.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of that central romance, it moves along at a nice pace -- neither too slowly nor too quickly for a 13-episode series. Exactly how it develops is for you to discover, but rest assured that it does not remain stagnant for long periods of time, at least in this season, as in Shakugan no Shana and its sequel.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The cute, borderline-sadist lead; the busty, libidinous rival; the surprisingly forthright maid; the bookish, quiet Nagato Yuki clone -- these may seem like stock characters pulled from the harem romance pool, and they certainly begin as such. As in Love Hina, however, we discover that these characters have histories and unforeseen connections, sometimes in far darker ways than I expected of this show. What's more, many of these characters actually change over time, as characters in a story should. Sure, the cast seems a bit crazy at first, but give them a chance. It's worth it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the male lead. Oh, the male lead. Saito's personality is what makes him simultaneously hilarious and divergent from the usual harem romance/datesim beta-male loser. We get the impression that he checks out every girl who crosses his path not because he's hopelessly desperate, but because he's a healthy teenage boy. Not that he's relegated to the role of lecher; he has his human and hero moments, too.\\n\\n\r\nSetting: Our story begins in your average Harry Potter-inspired magic school, complete with magic wands and quirky professors, but soon expands outward to encompass an alternate-history, magically-endowed Europe plagued by the class politics of magocracy -- that is, magi over non-magi. Though the central country of the show is fictional (apparently located roughly in the Aquitaine region of France), several real-world European powers have fantastical equivalents, often bearing the Latin names of the modern countries they mirror: Gallia is France, for example, and Germania is Germany. This becomes clear when we see a map of the fictional land. This world maintains interesting links to our Earth, but I'll leave it at that for fear of dropping spoilers. It's ultimately a surprisingly cohesive fantasy setting, and one to which I wouldn't mind returning.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Zero's art is reminiscent of Shakugan no Shana, also produced by J. C. Staff, and to a lesser extent Pani Poni Dash. It's a style that grew on me when I watched Shana. If you're a fan of more realistic art in your animation, however, be warned that you won't find it here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Despite being largely digital, Zero's music never quite descends into full-on cheesiness, as Shana's music did at times, nor does it overwhelm you with anachronistic elements unsuited to the vaguely Renaissance-inspired fantasy setting. The opening theme is quite catchy, for a reason I can't place, and as a fan of Kugimiya Rie and Hino Satoshi, I have trouble finding serious fault in the voice-acting.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: I didn't think Zero no Tsukaima would end up being the kind of show I'd be quick to recommend, but, to my pleasant surprise, it did. If you're looking for a tale of politics and romantic comedy, and don't mind that the ride isn't entirely serious from beginning to end, give this one a shot.",

Boy do I have a series for you!\r\nPlot: 3/10 \r\nFamiliar of Zero is an anime about an ordinary boy named Saito that is forced to be a magical slave to an obnoxious twat that summoned him from Japan to the far away land of extremely generic fantasy Europe. Here he must learn to adapt to his odd new life and learn about the various types of magic users. I am not going to go really in depth with the plot honestly. It soon becomes a very generic harem show and theplot is NOT going to blow you away. Here is a summary of the plot: Louise the witch treats Saito like crap, the abuse is played up for cheap laughs, Saito uses his magic sword wielding ability to do something heroic, he still gets treated like crap. rinse and repeat. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main male character Saito is exceedingly bland and Louise is the least likeable female lead I have seen in a long time! There are also plenty of supporting characters, but there really wasn't anyone I liked in this series. Usually I can find a couple characters I like in even the most mediocre anime, but here I got nothing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good since this anime had a decent budget. It was based on a successful light novel that I can only assume was somehow better than the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 if you aren't a masochist, 7/10 if you are.\\n\\n\r\nRemember in early 2014 when Japanese men were drooling over the uniformed hottie Natalia Poklanskaya and some Japanese youtube poster stated: \"I want her to yell at me and step on me\"? That is this entire fucking series in a nutshell. It is a fantasy for Japanese teen masochists who want to be dominated by hot European women. I'm not a masochist, and I don't see white girls as an exotic fetish, so I really didn't find anything to like in this series besides a few decent slapstick moments. The comedy sort of works in a few places, but mostly it is just obnoxious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI have met people (including one of my best friends) that thought this series was a comedic masterpiece. I REALLY don't agree with that assessment, but the series at least does some things right. The art is decent, the music is decent, the voice acting is fine. However, I felt that overall this was a very mediocre series that I wouldn't recommend to anyone...unless once again you are in fact a male masochist.",

            "content": "This is my second review of an anime series.  Please spare me. xD;\r\nI don't do many reviews on shows but I would like to review on this one. Since this series touched me a lot and its my childhood. :P\r\nOne of the series that expanded my variety of anime after Inuyasha and Shana.\r\nStory:\r\nYou have Louise, your mage that possess terrible magic and a boy that came from another world. He has to deal with the customs in Louise's world and has to face many obstacles; and with war, I'm not gonna spoil. Or I will try not too.\r\nThis series is a comedy, so itdoes have some harem/ecchi involvement. Though, I think this series would be better off without the ecchi and the harem. That way, the characters have room to develop.\\n\\n\r\nSo I would give the story an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very beautiful to look at. I love the character designs of the show; which made me want to continue to watch it. The fighting scenes was well done; with the graphics. I wish more anime would have art like this; and the art also reminded me of Shakugan no Shana. With Saito resembling Yuuji. :P\"\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, 10/10  for the art. 8D\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nSome of the music in the anime was really pretty, I liked how it worked well with the show. But I could NOT stand the ending themes. The opening themes were more--enjoyable. But I liked the second seasons opening the best overall; so the sound I would give\\n\\n\r\n7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters could use a little bit more development in the show. Like everyone else has said; I think Louise should START to trust Saito more instead of beating the poor guy senseless; and Saito should try to control himself more around the women. But then again, he's a 17 year old boy and pretty much the only guy other then Guiche. But what disappointed me, some of the characters you don't get to know about. And they're just there.\\n\\n\r\nLike Siesta, Kirche, Guiche, Montomorency. I probably spelled her name wrong, so shoot me.  Lot of characters like those are so undeveloped, it makes me a bit sad that you never know anything about them. The only real characters that are actually developed are Tabitha, Julio, and Agnes.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying that Saito is undeveloped since he does get stronger within the series and doesn't remain, \"weak,\" throughout. I just wish they would give more bio on Saito; like his past. Etc. But what puzzles me, I remember him in the first season saying he does not have a family. So that makes me wonder about him more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, the characters COULD use some improvement.\\n\r\nTo make a better series.\\n\\n\r\nSo I give a characters a \\n\\n\r\n6/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe series kept me watching until the very end. So despite the negative things about the show; it still made me want to keep on watching more and was sad about the end of the series. The season I liked the best was the second and the fourth season. Since characters started to develop more then; but you still wish to know about them. :P\\n\\n\r\nSo Enjoyment overall in Zero no Tsukaima.\\n\\n\r\n8/10.",

            "content": "Zero no Tsukaima-- The Familiar of Zero. With a badass name like that, what could go wrong? Awesome action with a really nice romance subplot, now that's what I like in anime. Which isn't what Zero no Tsukaima has. At. All.\r\nStory: 3\r\nTo sum up the entire plot in Zero no Tsukaima in one sentence, it would be, \"I feel like it'd be a lot better if I was nine.\" Me, personally, I'm an over analytical prick who over thinks every little thing. But I feel like someone with the IQ of a potato would still find the plot holes in this swiss cheese. To startoff, I'll list the pros. Just a little side note, I had to actually keep a notepad file open when watching this incase there was any little thing I liked in this show, because, believe me, I wanted to like it. \\n\r\n-The beginning of episode seven [Minor Spoiler: Saito is rewarded with a kiss from the princess and he does it too romantically and she passes out. Don't know why, I just thought it was funny.]\\n\r\n-The end of episode eleven [Major Spoiler: Not gonna say anything, but it was really satisfying after how bitchy Louise is to Saito.]\\n\r\n-The Ending Scene\\n\r\nThat's it. I kept a f**king list open the entire time. Alright, well, not going to turn into a rant, but, the main problem with the plot is that it's super predictable. You see everything coming a mile away. It's really generic, as well. However, the biggest, worst by far, always-there problem is that everything is too rushed. Way, way too rushed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nMeh.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the royalty free sound effects that were used in the final episode. The budget on this show was shit, to say the least, but the fact that they waited to spend the rest of their budget on the final episode, which was, as usual, too rushed and no build up. OP was decent. Yes, I do realize that being royalty free, they didn't cost money, and I made the point about the budget earlier, but I'll get more into it later.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nWow. I was just blown away by how generic and uninteresting every character was. The tsundere, Louise, isn't a tsundere. You see, with a tsundere character archtype, you have to have the character show affection towards another character after time. Does Zero no Tsukaima do this? *The rest of the character section is a spoiler* Yes, and it was very satisfying, to say the least. It was the filler episode, or at least I thought it was filler, episode six, or something like that. Louise drank a love potion by accident, and then grew really affectionate to our super generic and uninteresting protagonist, Saito. One of the characters who never appears after this episode said that it would last a year or so, so I thought it'd be until the end of the show, or at least the season. Needless to say, I was glad it happened. No more masochistic humor or fanservice (sometimes I'm not even sure), and finally a good female protagonist. Clingy, but cute. It all ends. And not on the final episode, the end of that episode, and very abruptly, I might add.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nYou know, for all the things this show completely and utterly fails at, there is a few good things. For example, if you were a masochist, the five would probably be higher. The very few, and I think there was about three total scenes of actual action in this entire season, were average. The budget was very lightly spent, and it was very clear to see that, and then the remaining budget at the end was spent entirely on the final episode, as I said above, which was cool, I guess. But it was cruel, too. Maybe the other episodes could have been good, like the royalty free sound effects in the opening of the final episode, but no. Not even close. The second thing I wanted to address in this is the transitions. That little wand that flips across the screen and that stupid royalty free sound effect plays. You'll hear it so many times. So many. The third thing is that the opening's lyrics make it seem like the show will be romance intensive, which isn't a bad thing by any means, but it's quite the opposite. It's probably, in order from most in the show to least in the show, unfunny generic comedy, decent action, masochistic fanservice, romance. It's just bad. At some places, it's so bad it's actually kinda good. But that's as far as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nIt was quite bad. Upon watching this, go in with low expectations and leave with lower ones. Seriously, it's bad. Just go watch something else. Anything else. Seriously. Please. I wish this show was good. I wish I wish I wish. But it's terrible. I'm actually sad to have had so high expectations for this show but instead was so drastically disappointed. Bottom line: This show is shit. Shit with a few sparkles, but none the less, shit.",

            "content": "I can&rsquo;t say I liked Zero no Tsukaima as much as hormonal, pre-teen male otaku out there. \r\nPlot-wise, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a revamped version of Maburaho. Other than being produced by JC Staff, the two series have other things in common. First off there&rsquo;s the setting &ndash; both series are set in a magic school. There&rsquo;s also the harem anime aspect &ndash; Louise, Siesta (my favorite!) and Kirche are all fighting over the token loser male character, Saito. Finally, there&rsquo;s the ecchi. It&rsquo;s a good thing that the ecchi in Zero no Tsukaima isn&rsquo;t as heavy as Maburaho&rsquo;s.\r\nIt was a stable ride for me duringthe whole series. There were no high points and low points. Let me reinforce my first point by saying that if I were a guy I would probably like Zero no Tsukaima more. Louise&rsquo;s tsundere antics would probably captivate me, and Kirche&rsquo;s presence would probably get my temperature rising, but that will probably never happen. As for Saito, he didn&rsquo;t really catch my attention. I did love watching his fight scenes but when he&rsquo;s not fighting, he&rsquo;s quite bland. Tabitha is too reminiscent of Yuki Nagato for me, but she&rsquo;s not as cool.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of JC Staff, the animation was good enough to satisfy me. Everything was very cutesy though &ndash; from Louise&rsquo;s pink hair (as well as the bevy of pastel color schemes throughout the series) to the Pokemon-ish familiars (except Saito, of course). The CG was lukewarm, and it&rsquo;s a good thing they used CG minimally.\\n\\n\r\nApparently most of the voice actors of Zero no Tsukaima also worked in Shakugan no Shana. The most notable name would be Rie Kugimiya, Louise&rsquo;s seiyuu, who is known as a tsundere seiyuu. She was Shana in Shakugan no Shana. There&rsquo;s also Satoshi Hino, Saito&rsquo;s seiyuu, who was Sakai Yuuji in Shakugan no Shana. Other name worthy of mentioning is the very well known Yui Horie, Siesta&rsquo;s seiyuu and Takahiro Sakurai, Guiche&rsquo;s seiyuu.\\n\\n\r\nI like the music too. The opening and ending themes were both j-pop-ish, which can be a good thing. Both songs were very cutesy and catchy, and I liked both. As for the BGM, I&rsquo;d say they were decent tracks. The BGM was fitting to the mood and feel of the series, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s THAT good.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wasn&rsquo;t that pleased with it, it wasn&rsquo;t so bad after all. It started and ended on the same note and consistency is a good thing for me. I might watch the second season just to see if I&rsquo;ll like it more.",

            "content": "Zero no Tsukaima takes place in an alternate world where magic and dragons exist. The majority of the story takes place at a magical academy where students train to become successful mages. Everybody has their own specialty whether it be earth magic or water. Enter Louise de long name not worth typing out. Louise is a high strung and cocky mage wannabe who can't do much of anything right. Every spell she attempts to cast seems to fail miserably and just blow things up. During the ceremony to summon what is to be your familiar forever more, she ends up summoning a boy by thename of Saito who comes from our world; more particularly Japan. So while everybody else has salamanders, moles, frogs and other creatures, Louise has a boy. \\n\\n\r\nThe story progression is all about the relationship that builds between Louise and Saito. She treats him like a familiar, or to be more precise like a slave pet. He has to wash her clothes, do her menial chores and even sleeps on the floor. Throughout the show their relationship begins to develop more and small plot twists are slowly introduced. Why the boy is special. Why Louise just seems to mess everything up. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story in ZnT is nothing that hasn't been done before. I don't like to grade based on precedence though as it is not fair to the subject matter. Louise and Saito slowly come together to make a good team and other characters are introduced that turn the show into &quot;Friends&quot; just with spell casting. It does get quite serious towards the latter part of the series, and I would say that it was actually pulled off quite nicely. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nAs I said in my opening paragraph, the initial thing that even got me to watch this show was Louise. I do hate to admit but I thought she was hot. I completely understand if you hit that back button right now. Even after the show is done, I still do. Remember, the back button is at the top left of your browser window, or you can just hit backspace. Anyway, the characters are all quite attractive in their actual originality. It does have the whole JC Staff production feel to it in the character design, but they are all nicely done. Although if you have a problem with the male in anime always looking like an average guy, you'll likely not like Saito's overall design. But if you enjoy big eyed cute girls, lolis, big breasted fiery red heads; then this show is gonna make you have a nerdgasm. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully the background animations are all paid attention to. Usually in shows like this, all the detail goes into character development and the background is left to die in a dark corner. Thankfully this wasn't the case with ZnT. Another thing that caught me by surprise is that they managed to throw in some obvious CG scenes without them standing out too much or just ruining the whole animation feel. When many shows throw CG into the mix, they make it stick out and just look awful, almost to say &quot;check out what we can do.&quot; ZnT does a wonderful job of balancing it out and pulls off a solid animation effort in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe first things that should always been addressed in the sound department is the opening and closing songs. Dead on! The opening is &quot;First Kiss&quot; by Ichiko and couldn't be more fitting for the tone of the show. The lyrics make much more sense than many Japanese songs tend to, and quite frankly it's catchy. Definitely recommended for the playlists out there. The background was fitting, which is really all you can ask from anime. The music played always fit the situation and there were a few that stuck out and were able to do a masterful job of getting the viewer into the emotional situation. Playful music was the main course for the show as it tends to be much more humorous and whimsical than anything. But when it got serious, the music did a great job of presenting that to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was actually quite phenomenal. Every character fit their personalities well. Even though I can't stand the overly effeminate characters in anime, at least he was voiced well. Louise had the very defiant, cocky and sometimes very vulnerable feel to here. I thought of her kind of as I did Naru from Love Hina. Except not so much of a b*tch (God I hate Naru). Saito was considerably better than many main male characters usually are. For once in anime, the guy wasn't represented by a complete and total nerd. He was actually a strong, intelligent and thoughtful guy. He had his moments, but overall when he talked, he kinda made me proud for us; for once. But the voice acting award has to go Nanako Inoue as Kirche. Kirche was the virtual arch-rival of Louise. She was one of the good ones at magic and made a point to rub it in the face of Louise as much as she could. Her character was given the voice of condescending know-it-all. She was also the school flirt, a serious mage and a seductress. Japanese women can be sexy, but their voices rarely scream sexual seduction. She manages to seduces the viewer, male viewer, quite nicely. That's an accomplishment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, ZnT is a short anime that is just entertaining. It doesn't provide a terribly deep plot. Many of the tools used in this show have been used many times before. The characters can be considered somewhat cliche. But that may be one of its charms. It doesn't make you think outside of your anime paradigm. It just allows you to sit down and enjoy the hijinks and life of some crazy characters. I can say that I just couldn't stop watching it once I started; it is one of those shows that just makes time fly so much faster. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have had your fill of &quot;guy can't admit to girl, girl can't admit to guy&quot;, girl hit guy for no reason or anything like that, you may want to steer clear from watching Zero no Tsukaima. Everybody else will pull something out of it in end that they will enjoy. I guarantee it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning: Minor spoilers (that don't really ruin much at all), as you'll see the majority within the first two episodes.\r\nThis is a review for all four seasons, posted here to warn you of how much pain you might be coming across. I've watched some pretty bad anime but Zero no Tsukaima and its sequels are very high up. I was spurred to finish it by the suggestion of a friend saying it got better and because I can't stop what I've started. Note - This is my first review and my opinion, think of it as you will.\r\nStory 4/10\r\nOver four seasons half the 50 orso episodes could probably be considered fillers. The storyline itself jumps from one sudden and convenient issue to another with not much really linking it together. Zero's subplot of the apparent romance between the Mage and her familiar attempting to progress yet the situations they pop up in are beyond repetitive and dull.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nNothing amazing and nothing awful, nothing about the art really bothered me nor drew my fascination.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nSee the above \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\r\nHere's the best bit. Within most anime that have two MC's, you'd hope to like at least 1 of them. Nope. As shown in the synopsis, Louise is a mate whose powers are lackluster. Her apparent talent that is picked up involves the overused \"explosion\" spell that is seen at a minimum of 3 times an episode. Her other talent is kicking the other Mc in the balls, as well as being an unsympathetic, trust/confidence lacking, angry, wannabe tsundere who never fails to be annoying. Saito, realistically, is just as bad, as someone who got transported from Earth to a different planet/universe, and immediately treated like shit (or a plebian) he, throughout most of the series, can be seen as someone without a backbone, who is probably a masochist considering he's so loyal and loving to a bitch that assaults him. Worse still, the 'assault' gag is so overused he just becomes a complete pushover whose only motive is to 'protect' someone who struggled to even comprehend his situation of being in a different world, and can't actually reciprocate his love 95% of the time. Funnily enough the best characters (with spines!!) were the supporting cast, Siesta, Jessica and Kirche, who actually had a personality and were enjoyable to watch. Later supporting characters are too, won't reveal names, but they somehow make you wish Saito picked a girl that, I don't know, actually and obviously likes/loves him. (P.s, this should have a harem tag instead of romance). All in all, don't get too attached to two boneheaded mc's, you'll be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3.5\\n\r\nI did like some of it, mainly when the supporting characters were largely involved with pissing off Louise as a team, otherwise I struggled through this when I usually finish a season (12 eps) a night rather than taking me two, dreadful, weeks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\r\nPlease be careful watching this (though hopefully I've put you off), don't expect anything to get better, Saito will always get caught being with someone else and the most overused gag ever will waste your time.",

            "content": "This one's gonna hurt, folks. My lowest review yet, but you should expect that from a series that capitalizes entirely on cliches without an ounce of originality or effort in any single field. Ladies and gentleman, I give you Zero no Tsukaima.\r\nGetting the technical bits out of the way, Zero no Tsukaima was average in audio and visual. No memorable BGM, forgettable OP, and an irritating ED, but the performances were rather pleasing in some cases. Rie Kugimiya plays the standard tsundere role well, but shines better in scenes where she's interacting with someone that isn't Saito, where her other sides become more apparent, suchas when she is with Henrietta. Unfortunately this doesn't happen often so it's mainly tsundere all the way. If you're into that, you're in luck. The rest of us aren't. Yui Horie and Ayako Kawasumi also turn in some decent though generic performances as Siesta and Henrietta respectively.\\n\\n\r\nVisual is just inconsistent. The character designs are very simplistic and basic with not much detail or imagination. While its very average most of the time, it becomes incredibly fluid at the oddest moments, such as a scene early on where Louise chases Saito around in front of Henrietta, or again where Saito fights Ward. Because the animation is so generic the majority of the series, these random bits of fluidity are suprisingly pleasing, but give a lasting impression that the series has been half-assing it.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed the series did half-ass it, and what better proof do you need than the characters? Rie Kugimiya typecast aside, mostly because it did work here, these characters border from stereotypical archetypes like Kirche to downright ripoffs like Tabitha, who is completely stealing from Yuki Nagato from her hobbies to the exact way she talks. It's like they told the seiyuu \"okay, now for this character, sound EXACTLY like Yuki Nagato from Haruhi.\"\\n\\n\r\nYet the biggest offender by far is Saito, one of the most irritating Mary Sues of a harem hero I've ever come across. Not only does he manage to attract nearly every girl to him even though he does nothing for half the series, but the plot decided to give him the ability to defeat anyone he faces, and the one time he does lose, he goes off and sulks about it as if he thinks it's his god-given right to defeat everyone.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, look... you have a fantasy world with magic and swords and dragons, so some special powers are to be expected, but the series actually gives Saito full deus ex machina capabilities by the end. It's disgusting how much this show gives him just so he can keep winning. The world of magic itself is no better. For a story relying a good deal on magic, the foundation of magic in this series is terribly simple. I will admit the cross-cultural \"magical artifacts\" were slightly amusing but even that grew tiresome.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting's relation aside, this series just doesn't know what it wants to do. It starts as a romantic comedy, then quickly shifts to a magical adventure without so much as a single notice. I also give no positive marks to a series that sets up a possible arc, then ends it after one episode with no resolution or purpose other than to show Louise in a bustier. Note that Louise in a bustier had nothing to do with the setup.\\n\\n\r\nThe best reason I can give for why this series was green-lit back in 2006 would be the boom of anime adapted from light novels and the birth of tsundere fandom, and it shows. There's so bad it's good and there's so bad I want to see just how bad it can get. Zero no Tsukaima is just bad. It's littered with cliches that have been run into the ground for years before this show, and the only new gag it can conjure up (horsewhip) just isn't funny no matter how much the series pushes them. Though Rie Kugimiya gives a solid performance and some of the world elements are intriguing, its desire to cater to every possible audience with a complete lack of direction or effort make it nothing short of a failure. If you're not a sexually-frustrated teenage boy who hasn't yet developed a distinction between good and bad anime, avoid this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Zero no Tsukaima a 3 out of 10.",

            "content": "Zero no Tsukaima should be an enjoyable action anime based in a majestically magical world, sadly it executes the premise horrendously, clinging to repetitive comedy and a subpar plot. The characters were written poorly; this is evidenced by their shallow nature and monotonous interaction, of which Saito and Louise are the worst offenders.\r\nSo, Zero no Tsukaima (after this abbreviated as ZnT) has a premise of a modern Japanese boy who ends up in a fantasy world after being summoned by her master, who happens to be a young, petite girl, with a fiery attitude. And with these two not getting along too well, this shouldset things up for a nice rom-com, right..?\\n\\n\r\nIn practise it gives a different result, the slapstick humour is overused and literally milked down to the very last drip. As a show which relies on its comedy, it should be a lot more variable. But because it lacked in this department, it often came over as annoying, this form of comedy has been used well, just not in this show. If you repeat the same guy getting hit by the same girl for doing the same troublemaking, you are not get any more fans from it. \\n\\n\r\nThe other part ZnT tries to attract its fans with is action and fighting against the forces of evil, now it did this a bit better. Though the plot itself was far too simple to be properly praised, the way it executed its action and the fact that it could get serious for once, meaning some actual romance ensuing, which came along with some cheesy lines by the protagonist was one of the few things I have enjoyed about the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself, which was put on a side track, is mainly about the two protagonists overcoming the tests they are given at their academy, and how they deal with their \"growing\" feelings with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe art-style is simple and quite easy to grasp, it suits the rom-com style it has. The animation is good, but nothing special. Not a lot to comment about this particular department. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound, which can be split into 3 different categories, Opening and ending themes, voice actors and general SFX. The first category, I think the opening fit the anime quite well, of course, it is all up to you whether you liked it or not, but if you enjoyed the anime a lot, the chance is a higher that you liked the themes and soundtrack it had as well. On the subject of voice actors I would like to stop a bit, since this anime contains what many have dubbed to be \"The Tsundere Queen\" in it. Now personally, I am not the biggest fan or her voice or roles, it is a little bit too high-pitched and comes over as annoying. Saito's image as a Louise's dog and maybe a slightly foolish teenager is well played by his respective voice actor. Other than that there is not too much to to be said. The SFX is something which is done, there is noting  extraordinarily odd. So it is hardly something people can discuss about. \\n\\n\r\nNow I will move on to the characters, which is my biggest disappointment of this whole series, there is not much in this pile of badly written characters I can give praise. So we have our main male protagonist Saito, who like I said earlier, came from the modern world, we know and live in. The first flaw I would like to give is, there is no desire to go back to his home. Does this person have the worst life in the world or something, normally, at that age. One would like to go back to his home. This is, in my opinion, a piece of bad writing on the aspect of backstory and character depth. By not making them have a past, they are very shallow, and this depth-ness is what distinguishes the generic character from the fleshed out one. \\n\\n\r\nThe second character who is ripe for some founded criticism is the main female protagonist, who is awfully loud & obnoxious. I would go as far to say that her character has been written in a way, that it effectively negates any progression this character could go through. When some kind of advance happens in the terms of romance between Saito and Louise (the main female protagonist), it is immediately undone by some kind of slapstick moment. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is not worth a lot either, they have a low amount of motivation and hardly any depth as to why they should fight the protagonists, aside from the whole evil organization stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion, is it worth watching? No. There is a lot of stuff which did this setup and plot better than this series, the positive point is that the second season is done a bit better, I might say that is worth watching.",

Immediately there are the ecchi elements and the political conspiracies that surrounds the characters.

Nothing too extraordinary, but not that bad either.Maybe the problem is that it was too short and we never really got the whole picture. Hopefully the second season will be better.",

            "content": "Zero No Tsukaima is what you&rsquo;d get if you crossed the Harry Potter flicks and Shakugan no Shana. One wonders if the title of the show was a response to the mandate for one-word monikers: Here it Goes Again\r\nThe basic elements of these stories are repeated ad nauseam, but astonishingly there is absolutely no difference. Seeing as there is no hope for redeeming itself from turning to an appalling cliched harem anime, I could not bear watching any longer. It is amazing how it only took five episodes took to suck the life out of me. \r\nBut if you must know, the story started withSaito Hiraga being magically pulled away from Japan and warped to the Tristain Academy of Magic. There she met Louise Fran&ccedil;oise de lulu jar jar binks or whatever her full name was, who was responsible for summoning him. Saito with no clue with whats going on, suddenly became Louise servant. This is the beginning of a magical, romantic adventure between two completely people bond by one resolve. MAN, that is good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nBeneath the main canopy is another commoner/noble story. I keep wondering why anime always wants to aggregate class conflict in anime's, it is getting too monotonous and repetitive with all the &quot;He's/She's just a commoner&quot; BS getting repeated as twice as much as I can take. It just isnt interesting to have that as a imperative contest for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI am sick of how there is no development happening between the couple. They had a chance, since they already made out but there is always the harem value that gets in the way. Plus, it is repulsive that I get to see Louise feel resentment to Saito whenever he gets flirtatious, this inevitably follows, whipping the hell out of the boy, which is a tired comic relief that is used repeatedly, and grows more irritating each time.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is the exact quantity you get from the recipe of disaster: Harem, dumbass hero, abrasive heroine, unoriginal plot, crippled comedy, paucity of development and uninteresting progression. If that doesnt scares you one bit, then go ahead and watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nI fail to see how it even brought about to make a name for itself(and two more seasons!). This anime belongs only to from where whence it once came, the trash bin. Spend your time elsewhere(and spend it where at least you wont risk vomiting in the process.)",

            "content": "Wow, I really was not expecting this to be a good anime, but it turned out much much better than I thought it would. What looked like just an average \"I can't confess\" love story turned out to have something special in it, maybe because they got to the point within 13 episodes like most animes don't.\r\nSTORY: 9/10\r\nThe story is very unique, as far as I can tell. Louise can't use any magic, but on the day where all 2nd year students summon a familiar to help them, Louise summons a teenage boy from Japan, which is obviously another world from the magical world. Fromthere it just kind of flows, and the fillers are very entertaining too (If they can even be called fillers).\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like the eye styles in Zero, cause im big on those. Everything else is great as well, I didn't see too many cliches in terms of art (see character for the cliches)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, it wasn't anything special. I thought the theme songs were OK, and the music in the anime was good as well. Overall, it was just good. Nothing memorable or anything.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI am actually surprised that I am giving this an 8/10. In fact, this anime probably has all the cliche characters of every anime combined. The tsundere girl, the quiet girl, the playboy, the... uhhh.... slut. Yeah, and there's even more where that came from. But there's always a character for everyone to relate to, even though they aren't that deep. Maybe it's not worth an 8 here, but I guess this cliche cast really got to me.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nObviously since Zero is a romance comedy shounen-ish anime, the enjoyment value is going to shoot the technical values in the face. The way the story is executed is very fun to watch, and the &quot;I want to confess but I can't&quot; moments are perfectly spread and executed. It's hard to get that kind of a story right, especially with all the animes out there that have flopped and given this stereotypical plotline a bad name. The comedy is great as well, I found myself laughing out loud at some moments and laughing when I knew what was coming (trust me, you will also.)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat more can I say? If you're into the romance comedy genre, I highly suggest you pick this up. One of my main concerns in the beginning was how childish it looked, but then I figured out the characters are supposed to be 16 (they look way younger... ?_?). Anyway, I would say if you don't like this anime within the first 3 episodes, this isn't for you. But please, just give it a try.",

While I will say that I personally hated it, it is completely fine if you do like it! I am only poking a bit of fun into, IMO, a very badly written story.\r\n- Do NOT read if you do not wantedto be spoiled since this is extremely spoiler heavy.\\n\\n\r\n- Do NOT read if you do not like profanity since the review is covered with it. \\n\\n\r\n- This isn't really a disclaimer but more of heads up. Since this review is huge there will be grammar mistake and stuff so please forgive me!\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode one\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tMain character is retarded. His reaction for being abducted is very calm and abnormal. \\n\r\n\u2022\tHe gets thrown the main chicks clothes and presumes its seduction, then acts like a retard (seriously what was he doing?).\\n\r\n\u2022\tHe just sort of stands about having been abducted, his thoughts contradict his actions.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWhy is everyone already an asshole in this show, so a human is forcibly made into  familiar without consent and everyone is OK with that no questions asked.\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe main chick is fucking insane. She is just platinum mad for no reason.\\n\r\n\u2022\tOf course she has to kiss him to seal the ritual. Well lots of things wrong with this. Firstly why was this not explained/shown beforehand? And why a kiss? To make their relationship deep and shit?\\n\r\n\u2022\tWhy was the teacher not informed of the crazy chick beforehand? Why should the teacher just expect to believe her students for no good reason other than it won\u2019t end well?\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo only after he understands her words he decides to run away instead of asking for help/guidance, logical. O and he comes past one obstacle and the first thing he does is crawl. You have to be stupid to think that would work. It also undermines his whole situation. Does he take being held captive by a \u201ccult\u201d as a joke?\\n\r\n\u2022\t So the asshole with the rose starts levitating the main guy. What a dick. I mean that is one scared human (I think?) and he just playing him like he is some trash. Do the people not understand he is fucking human?\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode two\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo the main character is chained up. Firstly I have to question the ethics and humanity of Louise since she clearly gives no fucks about our main guy. She seems mentally unstable, after all she go into fits of massive rage and treats her own species like shit. Like would you even treat a familiar like this, even it wasn\u2019t human?\\n\r\n\u2022\tNow she starts striping in front of him again. Ok so why does she think of him as a familiar and not human since he looks human and kind of acts like one? Does she have no shame? Also how does she expect him to wash her clothes if he is chained up?\\n\r\n\u2022\tO and our main guy once again shows us that he does not take the situation seriously (he has been taken away against his will) by just acting like an idiot when is throw some panties.\\n\r\n\u2022\tAlso the main guy is a submissive little bitch.\\n\r\n\u2022\tLouise won't even dress herself. I mean that really is the epitome of lazy\\n\r\n\u2022\tMain guy seems to have adapted pretty well to the surrounding. I mean if it were me I would try everything to get the fuck away if I were being held AGAINST MY WILL but that\u2019s just me you know. Also does this guy not care about his family? He has not even thought about them. What a guy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tBlonde rose guy again shows us his assholely when we find out he is dating two women at once. God is everyone in this show like this? I mean I have still to find one character that is likable.\\n\r\n\u2022\tShounen power for the win. Got to have those cheesy speeches before you fight you know.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI also like how convenient it is for his powers to start working. So how much plot armour do you have? I\u2019m betting a lot.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSee more evidence that Louise is indeed mentally insane. She now has no problem taking care of him even though only at the start of the episode she was convinced he was just a familiar. Like what exactly changed? Because he had a fight with a \u201cnoble\u201d and THAT made him look more human?\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode three\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tTsundere bitch. \\n\r\n\u2022\tWell I mean I was already pretty sure but our main character is of course a pervert. How original. How edgy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tAnd I shit you not I think I have experienced the most cringe worthy \u201csong\u201d ever. Like you can tell the writer but a lot of thought into that. Also even our main guy is a dick.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWOW. Main guy so smart. His thought process \u201cOK so she has let me off the hook so I think I will continue to make fun of her even though she is crazy and risk not getting food\u201d. Our hero, what a guy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI had a feeling red hair chick was easy but really you want to bang that guy? I mean you have spoken to guy like once and you already want his dick? Makes sense.\\n\r\n\u2022\tThis show is yoke right? She is in love with him? Kiddingz me?\\n\r\n\u2022\tThis show never amazes me\u2026 that is all.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo not only is blond rose guy a cheating bastard but this bitch as well? Whelp.\\n\r\n\u2022\tThis Louise character is truly a bitch. So after taking him away from red hair slut she proceeds to tell him she is going to treat him like a dog rather than human. HOLY SHIT. She has yet to treat him like a proper human thus far having chained him, eat food off the floor, etc. If she thinks that this is how a human should be treated she is utterly out of her mind.\\n\r\n\u2022\tNow she starts whipping him. This bitch needs to die. She is just awful to the people around her. I mean the reason doesn't even make sense, he is late due to something completely out of his control and she is \u201cjealous\u201d so she whips him. The writer is doing a great job hear making us hate all these assholes.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSeriously you\u2019re going to put your hands there on her chest rather than her stomach? Like are you retarded?\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo both of these chicks kick him the face when he says even something a little bit out of line. What a good way to show their love.\\n\r\n\u2022\tAlso I\u2019m pretty sure they are both complete idiots. The sword starts talking smack and they assume it\u2019s him even though it sounds NOTHING like him. How smart.\\n\r\n\u2022\t These characters have no redeeming qualities. Main dude is a pervert, he is an asshole, and he complains a lot, retarded and one indecisive bastard.\\n\r\n\u2022\tLouise is a tsundere\u2026 I have nothing more to add even though I could.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode four\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe bouncing boob sound. This show is truly classy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo the maid is of course one of those people with low self-esteem until our main guy comes along. Like really I\u2019m sure you would continue absolutely fine without him. After all there is nothing to suggest that you couldn't.  After all the world building has been extremely poor so far. I know next to nothing about how anything works.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo our main guy know red head like him but still chooses to go into her room. If you are not going to give her the goofballs then why go in at all. Like to like to see her tease you but then be like \u201cna fuck you bitch gunna now do the same thing to your rival\u201d. What a guy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tO shit drama. Maid now has work for someone else and main guy, knowing her for only a few days will of course do something.\\n\r\n\u2022\tTypical bad guy who is a dick for no reason. \\n\r\n\u2022\tI like how the main guy just waltz into red head slut\u2019s room and demands her treasure, explains nothing then goes into a fit of rage. Smart guy I swear guys.\\n\r\n\u2022\tMuch romance. So deep. Shame this guy gives no fucks.\\n\r\n\u2022\tThis main guy is hard to watch. Why does he just go into any situation head first without thinking about shit? He irresponsible and selfish. Nearly got bitch punished which he seems to care for so much (even though she is a bitch).\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode five\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\t\u201cI could wash your panties live\u201d \u2013 That main dude\\n\r\n\u2022\tSeriously though he is either retarded if he is serious or a masterful troll. I\u2019m going to bet on the former.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo my understanding is that ALL the jokes are basically sex/echhi ones. God at least try to be original. I\u2019m going to bet that they going to beat a dead horse to death with these jokes.\\n\r\n\u2022\tYes! More harem bait in the form of the princess\u2026 didn't see that one coming.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo queen and bitch meet each other brace each other and state they are friends and only then does main guy ask \u201cdo you know each other?. Well of course they fucking do, they just said so!\\n\r\n\u2022\tHow can no one notice the massive fucking golem? I everyone blind?\\n\r\n\u2022\tHow am I supposed to take this show seriously when it trying to have a plot. OK so where the fuck are the guards when the golem attacked? Why can bitch break through the barrier being a n00b while the golem cannot? \\n\r\n\u2022\tIt\u2019s not your responsibility bitch buts it\u2019s not the guards either since we don\u2019t have any\u2026\\n\r\n\u2022\tEnd episode with clich\u00e9 #5923. You know the old I didn't run away because otherwise I wouldn't be an \u2018insert relevant\u2019 otherwise.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode six\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tYhh bitch don\u2019t even think about being nice to my familiar. O familiar I\u2019m going to hit you for not rejecting one the few people who are nice to you. I mean god why doesn't the main guy understand? Because I certainly don\u2019t.\\n\r\n\u2022\tOK. Time to use the logic hammer. So the princess is going too held accountable because of the lack security around the academy and it being around the princess. OK so security must be outright bad since whoever decided to concentrate the guards in a single area is retarded. Like someone could just come from the side, the sky or some angle and give her the deaths. What is stopping them since no one would see them until it\u2019s too late.  After all a fucking GIANT GOLEM was only noticed when it made a huge crack in the wall. And why would the princess be held accountable. Doesn't she have someone who deals with guard formations and whatnot? Why would they make her do it?\\n\r\n\u2022\tWait so they just let red slut into the meeting no questions asked? Doesn't she have like a class to attend? \\n\r\n\u2022\tOMFG. So the headmaster asks who wants to go after the thief and of course those more suited for the job decline like pussies but agrees for the STUDENTS to go. Wtf what if they die? Will the headmaster just be like \u201co well\u201d. I\u2019d be OK with this if any effective world building had been established. But through the stuff I've seen so far this just seems completely retarded.\\n\r\n\u2022\tLol that justification for letting them go after her. Ok by my logic Louise shouldn't go since she can\u2019t do magic and is a massive liability. Headmaster states that he has HEARD slut is good at fire magic. So what? You\u2019re going to let her go on hearsay? And from what I have seen her fire magic is no match vs golem. And I can\u2019t comment shy girl since she is bland as all hell. We are TOLD she is a knight (how dull) so I guess that means she is good to go. \\n\r\n\u2022\tGod those boob shots. Please have mercy on me. Common misconception (probably not to those reading) but boobs of that size and magnitude are actually just distracting rather than attractive. Like 1/7 would not fap.\\n\r\n\u2022\tOK so they go into the shed/house thingy to check for clues/staff and proceed to not check\u2026 apart from shy girl. So main guy and slut and fucking useless but hey shy girl good job. You\u2019re like the only character to not piss me off.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo Tony appears and wreaks shit up and they attack it to no avail. Was I surprised? Of course not, their attacks where going to be fucking useless. \\n\r\n\u2022\tSo bitch just stands their makes a silly speech about what it means to be a noble because of some pride she has. Is she stupid?  Her pride nearly got her killed if it wasn't for our plot armoured Saito (main guy = Saito).\\n\r\n\u2022\tHoly shit. Main guy bitch slapped bitch. I have no complaints. 7/7\\n\r\n\u2022\tShe claims that she will be made fun of if she runs. She is mentally unstable I know but come on you would rather die than live and be made fun of a little?\\n\r\n\u2022\tFucking shuonen fights. So boring if you know they no chance of losing in the slightest.\\n\r\n\u2022\tO man that twist. Shame I give no shits about her or the people she is trying to kill. Also how did she go from bitch to evil bitch with basically no foreshadowing other than HAIR COLOUR?\\n\r\n\u2022\tAnd we don\u2019t even get to find out why she stole the dam thing. Real.\\n\r\n\u2022\tFuck off main guy you have barely even tried to get back home so stop being so sad fuck one those harem girls you have. Jeez.\\n\r\n\u2022\tYou are a fucking liar you do not want to go back home so shut your whore mouth.\\n\r\n\u2022\tDoes this guy enjoy being someone\u2019s servant? I, for the life of me, cannot figure out why he likes her or being a familiar since he is treated mostly like trash.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode 7\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo the episode immediately starts off retarded with our main guy misunderstanding a kiss on the hand for kiss on the lip. Like bitch clearly stated kiss her on the hand. I mean this interaction isn\u2019t even abnormal from the planet he comes from dammit.\\n\r\n\u2022\tAround 7:10 seconds. Why does this exist?\\n\r\n\u2022\tPlease Dilan-sama have mercy on my soul. I don\u2019t even know anymore.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo the slut who washes the dishes wants his dick already. Why?!?  What about this guy makes all women want to fuck him. So according to outside sources this guy is a 4/7 on the \u201cwould you bang\u201d scale. I don\u2019t think a 4 warrants all these girls wanting his penis.\\n\r\n\u2022\tMore assholes again. Of course the tax collector is just a dick for no reason other than to make Saito look like he actually cares.\\n\r\n\u2022\t\u201cI\u2019m the only one who is allowed to touch Louise\u201d #Creepy #ThisStillSoundsCreepyWithContext\\n\r\n\u2022\tO shit what a tense cliff-hanger. I\u2019m am literally on the edge of my seat. /sarcasm\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode eight\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tO look the boob groping \u201cjoke\u201d while riding a horse. I swear they used that already\u2026 I will tell you what is wrong with this. Firstly holding someone\u2019s chest rather than their stomach is just awkward while riding a horse so it makes no sense from a functional point of view. Also you are that much of a fucking pervert that you can just touch her pancakes. What a dick. This is actually one of the view times I am OK with her giving him abuse. Asshole deserves it.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWho hugs likes that\u2019s? Just seems uncomfortable.\\n\r\n\u2022\tJust a general thought not related to the episode, I still think that tsundere bitch is completely broken in the head and the way she treats main guy is evil but I think I at least understand some of her anger. This guy is completed retarded and unlikable so I can get the rage. \\n\r\n\u2022\tSo bitch has the most obvious feelings for main guy and is in utter denial. I am both understanding and totally confused. So does she actually realise she likes him or are her words not representative of her thoughts? Why does she like him? He is selfish asshole and is boring and unfunny. I mean hell, bitch herself probably abuses him for some of these reasons.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWait shy girl and slut are actually friends? Is this real life? Why? They seem to have absolutely nothing common nor do they even speak much to each other unless she is needed for the plot.\\n\r\n\u2022\tGawd, trying to use the sad story tactic huh? Seems grossly out of place in a light-hearted anime about boobs. I mean this will probably go nowhere and shy girl will only serve as more harem bait. Also this scene wasn't very impactful as it just kind of happened out of the blue with basically no foreshadowing. Like everything just seems to blown way out proportion with the music and crazy mum.\\n\r\n\u2022\tHOLD THE FUCK UP. Am I missing something or did I just go full retard? Did the mother of the shy girl drink that potion of mind rape knowing it would mind rape her? Why did she simply not throw is away? She clearly knew it was bad since she took it away from her daughter so why did she herself drink it? This make absolutely no sense what so ever.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWait she can beat a three-headed dragon but not a golem? And without a familiar? Much consistent, so logic.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI think one wanting a bath\u2026 or for that matter keeping ones self-clean is universal to the human race not just the Japanese. Do you think the rest of us just roll around in the dirt? And yes this is such an insignificant thing but fuck this guy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe maid is too fucking docile. Like really do you not understand the concept of bubbles? Could you not foresee someone being in that water? And why stand that close anyway?\\n\r\n\u2022\tHe\u2019s having a fucking bath what do you think he is doing? It\u2019s not hard to piece together.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWait a second! Did maid put bath in quotations as to question what a bath actually is? Baths and washing ones-self exists in this word right? \\n\r\n\u2022\tOK didn\u2019t she have a pot to transport? Was she like well I\u2019ve broken it so I can stop working now? She is just going to leave it there? Also main guy if you don\u2019t intend to give her the goofballs then man up and tell her to gtfo because toying with her (since you know she likes you) is a dick move.\\n\r\n\u2022\tAnd he upset bitch. What a guy. He likes her right (I\u2019m assuming he must since this a predictable harem/echhi show)? Why does he fuck around with women he is not interested right?\\n\r\n\u2022\tNot really sneaking if you rage talk to yourself out loud. Also isn\u2019t talking to yourself like that a sign of mental instability? Telling you guys she is mad in the head.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo knowing that bitch is in \u201clove\u201d with main guy, even if it was accidental, will main guy do? I\u2019m guessing he will mess around for a bit a toy with her some more. That is our main protagonist friends.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode nine\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tOK so this is a love comedy magic fantasy things so I get love potions a one those things that just exist in these kind of settings but is just seems highly unethical to use one of these things. Doesn\u2019t forcing someone to love you beat the whole of someone loving you? And with consent? Also why does blond girl want blond rose guy to even like her? I got the impression she hated him? Since you know he is a dick to her.\\n\r\n\u2022\tO gawd everything this blond guy says sounds like it came out of an 80\u2019s cheesy romance movie (not that I have ever watched one, just speculation on my part). He is basically as 1 d as you get. His personality is a potato.\\n\r\n\u2022\tHonestly I think one of things that most annoys about this anime is how its setting has potential. So you basically could explore a massive amounts of things/themes within the setting like social classes and mage rankings. You could also have that conflicting theme between choosing the people you have come to love in one world over the people you love in another. You also could have a had a theme on how difficult it is to adapt to a new setting when you are so used to an old one and how those people around you can help you. It also could have had a theme of what is more important in this world: being human or familiar? How sad\\n\r\n\u2022\tReal! Love potions are forbidden by law. So how did blond bitch get a hold of one? Does she not care both the law and human ethics?  She seems a like a pretty horrid person.\\n\r\n\u2022\tBlond girl doesn\u2019t even look like she cares she forced some to love someone else without consent (this sounds stupid but it forbidden by law no?). \\n\r\n\u2022\tI like how they can leave the academy no one even cares/notices. Like they have places which they stay in so I assume they are supposed to stay on campus right? I mean don\u2019t get me wrong if you want to leave campus no one should be allowed to stop you but isn\u2019t it board daylight so wont classes be on? They are going to be punished for skipping class\u2019 right?\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe \u201ccomedy\u201d is so bad in this show. I don\u2019t really like to judge shows on comedy since I don\u2019t understand Japanese comedy but this is just outright bad. So blond guy is \u201cdrowning\u201d right and unlike any normal person he just continues to flap around like a retard other than just swimming to the edge since it literally like a meter away. Also can\u2019t he just levitate himself out of water or something? \\n\r\n\u2022\tHas main guy killed before? He seems awfully ok with just killing a bunch of people for a tear. Given they are probably a bunch of assholes but I know I wouldn\u2019t want killing a bunch of people on my conscious. Unless I\u2019m misinterpreting eradicate for another meaning other than kill then this guy is an even bigger asshole than I could have ever though he would be.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI don\u2019t understand the love potion. So let us assume the only thing the potion does is make someone fall in love with you and nothing else is changed. Bitch already was in love with the main guy\u2026 the only difference of not being affected with a love potion is that she was unable to share her feelings. Now that she can share her feeling why does she act completely different? She should still have that same bitchy personality but know she is just clingy and paranoid. A love potion shouldn\u2019t cause her to have an entirely different personality.\\n\r\n\u2022\tMain guy treats bitch like she is 3 or something. \u201cBe a good girl and stay there.\u201d How condescending can you be? She is probably around the same age as you.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWait a second was that a\u2026 decent plot twist? Don\u2019t get me wrong everything is so shitty at this point that I can\u2019t feel happy about but it was foreshadowed last episode so I don\u2019t feel completely cheated it was them. Still though, shit characters and awful plot still make this bad moment. There is still NO tension or drama so it is just\u2026 disappointing \\n\r\n\u2022\tI feel like this is a little too serious over a fucking love potion in a comedy romance anime.\\n\r\n\u2022\tIt\u2019s one of those intense cliff-hangers guys. The mysterious man is named Cromwell, o shiiit.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode ten\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tSee this is what annoys me. We have these \u201cGermania\u201d and yet we know nothing about them. So how am I supposed to feel when she tells bitch this? I take it that this is bad since she clearly doesn\u2019t want to get married but honestly I feel nothing. I know nothing of Germania or the fucking country they live in. \\n\r\n\u2022\tThis entire scene is out of place. To my understanding this show is a comedy harem show not a show with a plot and characters that matter. Like why would I care about any of the stuff they are talking about? Even for those who like the show this scene is just weird. I don\u2019t know about any of the politics or nations or anything and the writers have decided to show us the worst way possible\u2026 by telling us rather than showing us. How am supposed to feel like any of this has meaning if I don\u2019t get to see/experience it? How am I supposed to know Germania is really \u201cbarbaric\u201d?\\n\r\n\u2022\tWell of course our main guy has the most powerful element: void. How exciting.\\n\r\n\u2022\tClich\u00e9 #4128 \u201cYou know, I will protect you\u201d speech. I mean really now does such a thing have to be said? Shouldn\u2019t it be a given that you protect her. I mean you might want to just reinsure her but could you have done it in a less cheesy fashion?\\n\r\n\u2022\tAgain lack of foreshadowing has prevented any potential drama and interest from happening. This Ward-sama has come out of nowhere and is bitch\u2019s husbando to be. Only problem with this is there was no build up or tension so I don\u2019t really care. I also know that things will just resolve in nice knotted bow so yhh.\\n\r\n\u2022\tHe is a nice guy huh? I bet you haven\u2019t even had a conversation with him yet so you know not enough to make such an assumption. \\n\r\n\u2022\tWait just a second? NO guy would do what this does if he didn\u2019t want to give bitch the goofballs. Lying bastard.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI could be totally wrong and I legitimately mean it but I\u2019m going to put money that ward-sama is not a nice guy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI think another reason I don\u2019t care they are getting married is that main guy doesn\u2019t actually care. So why are they making a big thing out of it? Would be way more interesting if main guy actually tried to fight for Louise\u2019s love.\\n\r\n\u2022\tMuch drama. So original. 7/7 would watch again\\n\r\n\u2022\tWhy are they suddenly fighting? This has come out of nowhere. No logical build up or anything. This makes no sense. What even is logic?\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo main guy loses to Ward-sama and Ward-sama is like you are unable to protect bitch. While I agree somewhat with that statement it is still a little off. Firstly how to expect some teenager to beat you? It\u2019s not exactly fair is it now. Also just because he lost to you doesn\u2019t mean he will lose to others. He beat a golem your statement \u201cyou are unable to protect bitch\u201d is inaccurate.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode eleven\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tHe is crying? WHY?!? Are you just a giant pussy because you got beat in a fight you agreed to?\\n\r\n\u2022\tThis guy just makes me even more fucking mad. This is actually one of the most awful characters I have ever seen. Even when bitch tries to cheer him up he just acts like a little emo bitch. Get over yourself and grow some balls.\\n\r\n\u2022\tO no Tony is back. Also really the clich\u00e9d #5331 evil laugh for no apparent reason.\\n\r\n\u2022\tThis Ward-sama is fucking creepy. Why does he feel the need to whisper I will protect you into her ear? She not only heard you the first time but if you really felt the need to tell her again wouldn\u2019t you have done it in a more normal way? A way that makes you seems less creepy.\\n\r\n\u2022\tFUCK OFF! ALL CAPS MODE ON! WHERE THE FUCK DID RED SLUT AND SHY GIRL COME FROM. WHY ARE THEY HERE? HOW DID THEY KNOW WHERE TO COME FROM? AND WHAT VERY CONVIENT TIMING!\\n\r\n\u2022\tAttacking from the side lol. She very clearly attacked you from the front. Mad coz bad?\\n\r\n\u2022\tYou yoking me? She can just jump into the air and teleport off. Amazing. \\n\r\n\u2022\tHow the fuck could red slut find out where they went? The only people who knew about the trip where the princess and those on the trip. So who could she have asked to find out? It couldn\u2019t have been princess since she must have left as soon as she was done. Was it magic because that would be waaaay to convenient? And just because she said it took her all day to find out does not make it a valid reason. \\n\r\n\u2022\tMain guy again being an asshole. He asks a question the inn keeper and he answers him. And only because the answer was not specific enough he has to throw a fit and slams the desk. What a guy. \\n\r\n\u2022\tReal. She somehow heard Saito\u2019s voice over an impossibly huge distance. I guess that makes their relationship deep and shit now?\\n\r\n\u2022\tLol. \u201cThere is no one here\u201d Suddenly 10 guards in front of your face. How could you miss them?\\n\r\n\u2022\tWhat? Now there is a war? And an organization pulling the strings? You are just making this shit as you go along aren\u2019t you?\\n\r\n\u2022\tFUCKING CALLED IT! Ward-sama is a bad man. How predictable can this show get!\\n\r\n\u2022\tAnd they make bitch in need of help. Clich\u00e9 #1 \u201cDamsel in distress\u201d. If you\u2019re going to you use this please add something original otherwise you are a complete failure of a show.\\n\r\n\u2022\tPls no more cheese in my face. Pls no more extremely convenient timings or clich\u00e9 dialog.\\n\r\n\u2022\tO no you killed the guy that only have 2 mins of screen time! Masterful writing and timing. What a twist! Seriously though how do expect me to feel anything for this guy? I couldn\u2019t care less since I don\u2019t even know who he is.\\n\r\n\u2022\tRight so this guy just wants to marry bitch for her personality? WHY??? Explanations are in order right? It would make sense if you wanted to marry her for political power or something but this just makes no sense.\\n\r\n\u2022\tJesus penis more ass pulls. Suddenly he has the power to absorb magic and make his sword stronger for no reason other than heart power? Why bother have him fight at all if he is just going to auto win? It\u2019s like playing a game on very easy when you have already completed the game on normal. Like why play the game on very easy at that point. You already know how to play the dam thing.\\n\r\n\u2022\t\u201cIf we linger why any longer we are done for\u201d say that while lingering. Why don\u2019t you just move then?\\n\r\n\u2022\tOK so they kiss at the end. I kind of don\u2019t mind this since it\u2019s not in your face and shiz. Shame the characters, setting, and everything about the show sucks. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEpisode twelve\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tI don\u2019t think you can take full responsibility here. How about the people who hired Ward to be the guide. Surely it was there job to ensure that he would fulfil he his duties and that the fact he was unable to shows they hired the wrong person. \\n\r\n\u2022\tI like how the show is regressing rather than progressing. At this point the climax to the finale should be getting bigger. Why the episode has started with more echhi/tsundere shenanigans is beyond me. Why is it slowing down with only two episodes to go?\\n\r\n\u2022\tI fucking hate main guy. The asshole kisses bitch then acts like nothing happened. Why is he in denial? Also at this point he MUST know bitch likes him. So why does he just run off with maid and not explain anything to bitch? You are at the very least friends so the least you could do is explain why you are leaving. Jeez\\n\r\n\u2022\tExplain to main guy why is it ok that you don\u2019t tell her? It\u2019s not like you had to go right then and there I\u2019m sure she would have given you time to talk to bitch.\\n\r\n\u2022\tOK so it\u2019s going to be like that huh? You\u2019re going to deny that you like bitch for whatever reason. You writers make me sick, just making main guy be in denial for no logical reason other than to keep this haram shit going. Pls stop writing.\\n\r\n\u2022\tWhy does he look like he actually wants to go back home? This guy has barely said or done anything to even try to get back. I\u2019m sorry but he is just a walking contradiction.\\n\r\n\u2022\tMore random sad moments that come out of nowhere! So the princess was in love the prince? Where did this come from? And why should I care? I barely knew either of the characters.\\n\r\n\u2022\tHow do expect him to mass produce gasoline if he doesn\u2019t even know what it is? Do you even know how it\u2019s made? Because given the technology this world has it seems to be it would be pretty hard to obtain.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nLast episode\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tWeird that they add a bunch of new sound effects to the OP of the last episode. I don\u2019t really get it since they sound out of place since it doesn\u2019t flow well with the sound already there.\\n\r\n\u2022\t\u201cI will take command of our military\u201d \u2013 Princess. OK time to use the logic hammer again. So the show has failed to present anything that would suggest you would be good at commanding an army. If anything the anime has suggested you would be an awful candidate for such a job. After all remember when that golem attacked the academy and you thought it would be a good idea to concentrate all your troops into one super dense area so you didn\u2019t even know you were being attacked? It seems to be you are horrible at strategy and tactics. GG WP!\\n\r\n\u2022\tNotice how half of his memories are ones of either abuse or sadness with bitch. See how their relationship is mostly artificial with no real weight? \\n\r\n\u2022\tThat is the most underwhelming invasion I have seen. One ship? Kiddingz me?\\n\r\n\u2022\tThat outfit the princess is wearing seems pretty impractical. What is she going to do? Seduce her enemies to death (which to be fair might not be the worst plan\u2026)? \\n\r\n\u2022\tOK I thought the invading parties numbers where underwhelming but the defending side is a joke. How am I supposed to take this war seriously? Also why the fuck is bitch there? She can\u2019t possible defend herself against trained soldiers. Won\u2019t she be a massive liability?\\n\r\n\u2022\tWhy is blond rose guy still in his uniform? This show is retarded.\\n\r\n\u2022\tI have no more yoke to give. I don\u2019t understand anymore. The impracticability of both flying a plane and using his sword at the same time. \\n\r\n\u2022\tWhere are the defending sides\u2019 mages? Don\u2019t they have any? Why is just Tony a problem?\\n\r\n\u2022\tEven more retarded stuff. Why doesn\u2019t she make a new golem? Why was she not burned to deaths since she was covered in the oil?\\n\r\n\u2022\tWard-sama has map awareness of a potato. Isn\u2019t this guy to be an elite fighter? Why didn\u2019t he see that dragon attack coming from a mile away?\\n\r\n\u2022\tOf course Loiuse happens to be super op and have the most broken magic in the world. How interesting. See this is just boring since we know that it\u2019s just bound to work with no consequence. \\n\r\n\u2022\tDid bitch just mass murder everyone on the opposing side? Given the attacking side where a bunch of dicks and I don\u2019t think they had a chance to surrender but still\u2026\\n\r\n\u2022\tSo after all he has been saying about how badly he wants to get home he fucking doesn\u2019t? FUCK OFF! You lying piece of shit. I guess this is just a middle finger to your family huh? \u201cO sorry guys I\u2019d rather flirt with a bunch of girls than be with my family\u201d. Our fucking hero, what a guy!\\n\r\n\u2022\tClich\u00e9 villain is beaten just like that. What an ending you know. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSince I have a lot to conclude I will divide the conclusion into multiple sections.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSo this is where most of the problems lie in this show. A decent show at least depends on characters that are likable and this show has no likable characters. I will deconstruct the ones that matter and give my opinion on how they can be improved.\\n\\n\r\nSaito - This is possible the worst character of this show... or of any show. He \\n\r\nfails even the most basic traits of a good character. He is not relatable in any \\n\r\nway having basically zero charisma, being an asshole for no reason, flirts around with a bunch of women even though he likes Louise and she likes him back, indecisive, rushes head first without thinking about it, etc.\\n\\n\r\nHe also doesn't care much about his family which he basically never mentions and never feel homesick yet always makes the claim that he wants to return home. Not only is this a contradiction but it makes him come a across as a heartless asshole. \\n\\n\r\nWhat the writers could have done IMO is have him talk a little bit about his family. This would not only make him come across as a more likeable and relateable guy but actually proves that he wants to go back home.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLouise - Her character is just a complete and utter mess. I don't like the tsundere archetype since these people don't actually exist in real life so its hard to relate to them however if character development/history is explored and developed enough then that is perfectly acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nHer tsundere ways are, however, not even remotely explained so she just comes across as a crazy bitch. Had the writer just been bothered to give even a small explanation then her character might have been bearable. And personally I would have toned down the crazy a bit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNo other characters are worth talking about since they are just 1-D cardboard cutouts.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for characters is 1/10. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe story is abysmal if you can even call it a story. The structure and flow and completely nonsensical. It basically does its own thing when it likes and how it likes it. Since I cant describe the story much beyond the synopsis because it is so random I will not bother.\\n\\n\r\nInstead I talk about how how the story could be improved. For one the story could actually have a sense of direction by using, for example, the goal of the protagonist to get home and his journey. It can also explain some of the themes its premise presented like social classes and mage rankings. You could also have that conflicting theme between choosing the people you have come to love in one world over the people you love in another. You also could have a had a theme on how difficult it is to adapt to a new setting when you are so used to an old one and how those people around you can help you. It also could have had a theme of what is more important in this world: being human or familiar? (taken from episode nine). By using these the story could be great!\\n\\n\r\nStory gets a 1/10\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nAnimation, art-style, sound, acting and all that jazz\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nHonestly all of this stuff was alright but not great. The animation was alright apart from the fights which where just very unimpressive and uninspired.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was kinda OK. Backgrounds where actually pretty decent  but character designs where mediocre. Saito's in particular was bad, just being very bland and generic just like his character. At least SAO had amazing visuals to make up for its awful writing. \\n\\n\r\nSound was decent. That is all. Voice acting was also decent. No one stood in particular but no one was bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.5\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nMy enjoyments/final thoughts\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAlright so I hated this anime but at the same time I also quite enjoyed it. Yup. It was fun ripping it apart and being honest I can kinda maybe understand if someone liked this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment gets a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason I rate the show so low is because of the potential it hard to better than the average with its intriguing setting and possibilities. But because it failed it has made me sad and mad.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gets a 1/7. WOULD NOT WATCH EVER AGAIN!!!!!! \\n",

An upcoming test at her academy requires her to summon a familiar, a servant and partner to support heras a magician. Despite desiring a familiar that would be superior to her constantly mocking classmates, Louise ends up summoning Hiraga Saito, a Japanese boy. The story of this season was good a bit of plot holes, some things didn't make sense and the pacing was ok, the thing is that is almost the same thing in every episode, where Louise just beats Saito for almost anything, only in the last ones the things get interesting, overall is good.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe art style is good, nothing to be amazed of, the characters are well done but could have been better, the voice acting is good and the background music is not bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound was good, the music background too, the VA was very good so the soud overall was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe cast of characters can seem generic and bland, maybe for you not to care about them and are slow paced most of them, because there are four seasons they never go deep on this season with character development or back stories, just focused more on Louise and Saito and to allow them to get closer, even tho they fight a lot and disagree with each other. Good characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt was good but i expected more from this season, but i don't mind a lot because there are 3 seasons left.",

            "content": "!Spoilers but you will need to read this b4 you watch 100%!\r\nOK, so i could write a complicated review about why i disliked this so much, but im to lazy to do that so here it goes\r\nStory: Fk of\r\nDude gets pulled out of some dimensional arse, and is just told to deal with it. AND HE FKING DOES. Well ok, but then he becomes the servant of some little bitch, AND HE AGAIN SEEMS TO BE OK WITH IT. And she treats him like an animal, not a human for some odd reason i cant wrap my mind around. Then there's all of a suddenthis Void magic, and MC is apparently the familiar of the only void mage ever, even though he just got pulled out of the arse. But they apparently think we wouldn't realize. Its so dumb that it hurts. The most original part of this was either the slut or the pedo tbh.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe only good looking character is the red haired Slutty chick, so that's that but not so bad i guess.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI wanted to kill myself after hearing the dub, so i went sub. BUT I GOT FKING SURPRISED WHEN THAT WAS EVEN WORSE. The bitch sounds like a 4th grader who has parents with more money then fking Justin Biber.(and she sounds like a fan of him) aka garbage get out of my face.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:Ok, wtf. \\n\r\nIt was so fking hard to watch after like ep 8 and i kinda began to hate it... Mostly because of the Bitch, and the MC. Mc clearly loves the flat chested bitch for some odd reason, even though he has someone like fking Siesta and that just pissed me of so god damn much. He's a fiking pussy for not fking that red haired hot chick, who actually was nice to him and offered it multiple times. Then they at the end get a fking moment and he forgets that he wanted to fking leave. Like cmon. And why i didn't just run away from such a dumb bitch is beyond me tbh. He like, legit just got pulled out of his everyday life by some bitch and he accepts it. jesus fk i hate him.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the ungrateful bitch who takes MC for granted and legit abuses him daily. MC puts up with her bs and does not give a fk, which also blows my mind. She loves him aswell obviously but shes still a stuck up little bitch against him. She legit makes him sleep on the fking floor, like are you dumb he has saved you multiple times and is a OG badass(and pussy) but you treat him like garbage. Fk of ya dumb cunt. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI enjoyed watching hentai more then this, not just pleasure but all around liked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nSuck my dick, i wanna die.\\n",

            "content": "I enjoy a good romcom every once and a while, and if it can be combined with another genre to create more or better situations, then all the better right?  A situation, setting, and characters can make a romcom really good, even if it's taking an old concept and adding in a new element.  \r\nSo we get Zero no Tsukaima.  the story of a noble mage from a magical realm and her familiar, a human from our world.  Sounds like a good mash-up like Inuyasha, Shakugan no Shana, or any of the many magical girlfriend animes out there.  The problemis, this series, though it combines familiar elements to make something new, it does not seem to work well.  While I loved Baka to Test for combining slice of life high school drama with monster training, this simply did not do it for me.  To be honest, Zero came off as cut and pasted together, with nothing really original to offer.  \\n\\n\r\nPlot:  Louise is a mage in training in her second year who must summon a familiar as part of her curriculim/rite of passage.  In what seems to be a freak accident, Louise summons a normal boy from our world in moddern Japan.  Hilarity ensues?  \\n\\n\r\nMost of the plot revolves around Louise and the boy, Saito's relationship.  Saito struggles with wanting to go home, Louise struggles to prove herself a strong and capable mage, and the two go on various missions together.  Oh, yeah, and boobs.  It seems at every twist and turn there is some woman with a large chest who is inexplicably attracted to Saito.  Misunderstandings ensue and Louise whips Saito with a riding crop in an attempt at slapstick comedy.  Besides, we've seen this in almost every other romcom harem comedy.  Boy meets girl, boy sees other girl in suggesgive situation, original girl beats ever loving crap out of boy.  This might be funny once or twice, but the joke repeats, and repeats and repeats on a loop throughout the whole series.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  And when a relationship does start to develop between Saito and Louise, Saito still seems to be interested in other girls.  Rather than using this for actual conflict or drama, it results in, yep, more whipping.  No development of their relationship, no understanding, just whipping.  Louise doesn't even bother switching up punishments, or using other gags as punishment.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the magical school element, many have compared this to Harry Potter.  I would sooner compare it to The Worst Witch.  In a magical school, Mildred Hubble is the worst witch, unable to perform even the most basic spells and earned the nickname 'Worst Witch' from her peers, and later discovers she, in her own way, is in fact quite powerul.  Sound familiar?\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes a turn about halfway through and tries to add in a little political intrigue.  Tries.  In the end, it doesn't really accomplish the backstabbing, coat and dagger politics of Last Exile or Le Chevalier D'Eon.  They seem to be trying, adding in familiar, historical and mythological elements to the story.  Unfortunately, they are often full of holes, poorly executed, or seem to come completely out of nowhere.  Let's take Tabitha for example.  The quiet bookworm friend of Louise's school rival Kirke is revealed to be a Princess from Gallia.  She might have inherited the throne too, if her father had not been murdered by a faction that wanted to put her father's brother on the throne instead.  Her uncle also wanted Tabitha out of the line of succession (which would not happen with Early modern primogeniture laws in which MALE heirs suceed) and one of his supporters tries to kill her via a glass of poison.  Her mother gets wind of it and...alright, seriously, if someone tries to poison your kid do you A) Take the poison away from her and use it as evidence to bring the bastard to justice  B) Take the poison away from her and dispose of it so everyone will be safe  C) Take the poison away from her and drink it youself inducing a lifetime of mental scars for your child and leaving her to fend for herself when you become and insane vegetable.  Tabitha's mother and parent of the year chose C.  Political intrigue?  Yes.  Well executed?  No, not really.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat really grates me about this series though is the History parallels.  Each country has an Early Modern European counterpart.  Gallia is France, Germania is Germany and Albion is England.  Might be original if I hadn't seen it in Trinity Blood first.  But in the Albion subplot, involving a revolution, involved elements that personally offended me as someone with Irish heritage.  \\n\\n\r\nA romcom with excessive panties and gags about boobs, brought up Oliver Cromwell.  \\n\\n\r\nNot Cromwell himself, but his equivalent in a parallel universe.  That still doesn't make it acceptable to me though.  Some might say I'm butthurt over something that happened hundreds of years ago, but this to me is serious.  Oliver Cromwell slaughtered 25-40% of Ireland's population, and became the closest thing to a military dictator England hand, led an ultra Puritain regime that banned Christmas, staughtered Catholics by the thousands, and these people had the absolute gall to turn him into a villain in an anime romcom focusing on panties and boobies.  Next time, let's imply something about Hitler, shall we?  \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound was something I kind of liked.  It was nothing special, but the European flavor brought out the exotic location well.  The J-pop opening was cute, and fitting with the cutesy style of the characters and the romantic comedy premis, and the ending seemed to sum up the character's feelings as well.  If you have a choice between sub and dub, pick sub.  The English voice track left a LOT to be desired.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art was reminissent of moe and seemed to have a slight influence from nineties fantasy anime like Escaflowne.  The animation was nothing mindblowing, but it stayed at a consistently good level throughout the whole series, never really dipping in quality.  Character designs are pretty standard.  There's the flat loly, her big breasted mature rival, the book worm, the playboy, the fat kid, the old wizard, the normal boy...we;ve seen them before, and honestly they did not try to do anything really new or unique in the character designs.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, they might as well been pulled out of a stock folder.  The young girl who has useless magic and turns out to be a sort of 'chosen one'.  The busty and sexually mature rival to the smaller girl who's main motivation is sex/love.  The bookworm with a tragic/interesting past who rarely speaks or socializes.  The playboy.  The perverted old man.  The normal everyman for otaku boys to project themselves on.  Villains whose main motivations are being evil for the sake of being evil (seriously, they take over a kingdom, and slaughter the royal family, and we have no idea WHY.  Also the Cromwell reference.  I won't forgive this series for that.)  None of the characters seem the least bit original, and their dialogue is completely cliched.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for Enjoyment, I know a lot of people like this series and I can see why.  There's something here that almost everyone can enjoy.  Girls can get into the romance, guys can like the fanservice and explosions.  At the same time though, it's all usually underdeveloped, cliched, or unexplored.  I suppose this might be covered in later seasons, but in this one, nothing really gets resolved.  The good guys save the day, but the show's main focus, Louise and Saito's relationship does not seem to have changed since day one.  Saito screws up, Louise beats him, end series.  For those who like the cliches, good for you and you will probably like this.  For me, I didn't, I explained why, and please respect that.  \\n\\n\r\nWarnings:  Panties galore, boobs, boob gags, mild language, character death, fighting, explosions, abusive relationship, reference to debatably genocidal miserable wretch of a human being who slaughtered my ancestors.",

            "content": "Story 3/10\r\nThe story starts in a magic school where the failure of a female lead summons our protagonist to be her familiar. A magic school is a wonderful ideal in theory however this is not used in any sort of effective manner. It uses magic in the story but only for minor bits of action and torturing Saito so it takes the fantasy out of it. It quickly devolves into a bland, tasteless harem comedy that really isn't even that funny. The characters have no really explored back-story and feel like they were picked out of a harem character pool of cliches.\r\nArt 6/10\r\nI have noreal complaints about the art. It doesn't blow you away but it's pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't bad and the OP was pretty good. The ending song however leaves much to be desired so the score takes a beating in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\nI would have given a lower score if it was possible. This score does not take into account voice actors.\\n\r\nFirst the protagonist, Saito, He has no depth to him at all. When he was being tortured he took it like it was no big deal and he had no real inclination to run away after the first time. He is then found to love the one character who treats him like crap.\\n\r\nNext we have the main female character, Louise, who is also said failure. She is a character with absolutely no good points whatsoever. She is without a doubt the worst main female character I have ever seen. She is advertised as a tsundere but we quickly find she is just a really horrible human being. She made the anime go from harem comedy to glorified torture porn, BDSM, etc. within two episodes. She tortures, starves, and verbally abuses him in a way that goes from funny to cringe-worthy in halfway into the second episode and it never really goes back to funny. She has tons of pride but no fighting ability whatsoever.  She makes herself fight all the time and then ends up having to be saved by the very guy she tortures on a daily basis.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters really only serve as a way to give Louise new reasons to torture said MC. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10\\n\r\nThe art and sound are decent but do nothing to make up for the story itself. The plot is boring and where sometimes cliched does not mean bad this story makes it worse. The characters though are what truly makes this story truly horrid.\\n\\n",

Big, smokey explosion. But she still managed to summon her familiar. However, it's not a cat, owl, dragon, or bugbear, but instead it's a human! Hiraga Saito, from our very own Japan even.

An upcoming test at her academy requires her to summon a familiar, a servant and partner to support her as a magician. Despite desiring a familiar that would be superior to her constantly mocking classmates, Louise ends up summoning Hiraga Saito, your average Japanese boy. Even with Louise and Saito both unwilling to accept each other, they have no choice. Louise cannot attemptanother summoning and Saito cannot return to Japan, and so their life together begins. Based on the novel by Noboru Yamaguchi.\\n\r\n(From MyAnimeList)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Opinion\\n\r\nI heard about this anime a little while back... though I wasn't completely sure if i wanted to see it or not. Finally, I was like &quot;what the hell&quot; and I decided to watch this.\\n\r\nIndeed the premise, opening, and photos seemed to promise a fun, comedic anime. And for all intesive purposes, it was. However... it wasn't as funny as i would've hoped. Some of the jokes tend not to work. Indeed, I kept thinking that this show would've been better if it had a bit more action to tie in with the jokes.\\n\r\nHowever, towards the end of the season, the action, character development, and comedy picked up and i really started to enjoy the show.\\n\r\nAs for things i liked, the biggest ones would be the voice actors. They're the same people from Shakugan no Shana.... so whenever Louise would yell at Saito, it was like a good deja vu.\\n\r\nAlso the animation is quite well suited for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlso as a note... there is a sequel series that has already aired. Zero no Tsukaima; Futatsuki no Kishi.\\n\r\nAnd a 3rd season is confirmed for the Spring 08 season\\n\\n\r\nOverall... enjoyable series... though fell a little short of expectations\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to...\\n\r\n- Shakugan no Shana\\n\r\nBoth the lead characters are girls, and they both have a hard time expressing their feeling for the main boy of the series. Also the same voice actors.\\n\\n\r\n- Fullmetal Alchemist\\n\\n\r\nBoth these animes had the parallel world idea, with one world being our own, and the other one having the ability of magic.\\n",

            "content": "Tsundere galore! Zero no Tsukaima (or The Familiar of Zero) tells the story of two lovers \u2013 or so we are told. This delightful anime takes place in a fictional world where magic is all around and aristocrats (in other words: the rich people; as opposed to plebeians, the average peeps) are being taught magic in school. We are introduced to a magic academy where Louise Francoise is having difficulty keeping her spells under control and therefore is being scorned by her fellow classmates who call her Zero Louise.\r\nThings take a rather interesting turn when the day comes for the students to summon their familiars(some sort of special ritual where everyone gets to summon a magical creature that will protect them and be at their side forever) and Louise unwillingly summons a human plebeian named Saito, who seems to have arrived from another world. Although Louise is rather reluctant to accepting Saito as her familiar, she is left with no choice and must come to terms with the fact that she is no bound to Saito. Her \u201ctsundere\u201d side kicks in when she starts punishing Saito for little insignificant things like talking to other girls or disobeying her ridiculous commands, and he is forced to sleep on the ground and wash her clothes, among other things.\\n\\n\r\nZero no Tsukaima isn\u2019t a particularly unique anime series, but it delivers everything your little Asian heart wishes for (I said that in a very non-racist way, believe me!) and much more. The characters are quite stereotypical and you\u2019ve encountered them before if you\u2019re even in the slightest familiar with Japanese anime. Louise is the typical tsundere who treats the guy like crap, but deep inside he loves him and they share a special connection. Saito is that guy who gets treated like crap but he somehow has feelings for her \u201cmaster.\u201d Then you\u2019ve got a couple more supporting characters like Kirche who is more or less in conflict with Louise and keeps getting Saito into trouble for flirting with him all the time. There\u2019s also Charlotte, the quiet girl who never speaks but is incredibly powerful and helps the others out at times. Siesta is the \u201cgood girl\u201d who works as a maid in the academy and is more or less the third piece in the Louise-Saito-Siesta love triangle.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters may be clich\u00e9, but they are done to perfection. They are indeed predictable, but are used in a very modest manner and never exceed in cheap jokes or typical situations. The story seems rather simple at first, but as the plot keeps progressing more and more gets revealed and the little twists here and there make up for some excellent entertainment value. There\u2019s enough humour to go around, but it never feels too much and is used exactly when needed. I was surprised to see how entertaining this anime actually was. From the very first episode, I was hooked and it never let me go. The pace in which Zero no Tsukaima progresses is also done very well and it never feels like the anime was rushing towards a certain point (even though the last couple of episode covered a great deal of story compared to the first ones).\\n\\n\r\nI could ramble on and on, but that\u2019s about as much as you need to know. It\u2019s not a series that is going to break any new ground, but it is truly one hell of a fun trip and deserves every anime fan\u2019s attention. I didn\u2019t ask for much, but Zero no Tsukaima delivered everything I needed from an anime series. Looking forward to next season!",

The story forcuses on a magic school academy for the nobles and on the day that they are to summon their partners, the female lead summons a boy from another world which is our world i guess, however, she believes he is a commoner from her world and treats him like a slave,little do they know that he will become the ledgendary partner or familiar that can own with a sword.\r\nThe story is unique as it differs from your usual fantasy anime, though itdoes inculcate the typical main chracter is drawn into another dimension theme it does not focus so much on that so it does not seem cliche. Also ifyour thinking of harry potter or something along that line then you are sadly mistaken, the magic is totally different. Also There is a good deal of romance in the story which is a plus for me. Also it gets more interesting when there are massive battles which make it more epic.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quie appealing and suitable for a romantic comedy but there is no exceptional features.\\n\\n\r\nThe songs(opening and closing) i find are quite pleasant to the ears but there was no insert songs to bring out the mood especially since there is a good deal of romance and drama in the sho, so insert songs would have made it better.\\n\\n\r\nThe character is what make the show so interesting, each character has some kind of depth and makes the story very comical at times, especially since the male lead is kind of perverted so it gets funny cause the female lead will start blasting bolts at him whenever he is wth another girl. Also the characters do show maturity when the time requires it so its not totally spastical, which is what makes the story a good romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the story because from the comical moments to the dramtic romance to the epic action clips, so it was quite to my liking though it is kind of short, it would be better if it was longer. But there is a second series so its okay. In fact i think it was a good decision to have two series so that each series will focus on a single arc and have an underlying plot throughout each series which draws in the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is very versatile containing several genres to some depth,if you like romance then go for it, f you like fantasy then go for it, if you like action then there is something in t for you, so give it  try it is definitely worth it, and if you like this series you will definitely love the second one.",

Ps i love to spell shit wrong so look out for that. \r\nSo Zero no Tsukaima is just a really fun anime, that was just simply easy to watch and fully enjoy. The anime does a great job of making you care about the characters and makes you want to watch more. Wheni watched Zero no Tsukamina i have to just marathon it, i was hooked almost instantly. If you like  Tsundere types then Louise is your girl and as far as the male lead Saito is a really like able character with some very funny traits. The comedy is all in good taste and is placed well though out the anime keeping for the most part a light hearted feel. Though that doesnt mean that there isnt a fair share of drama, the art style i feel was very well used to depicted so of the more heart wrenching moments of the which there are many. To sum up i really enjoyed this show, you can really feel yourself getting sucked into the story although the outcome might be easy to see, i would fully recommend watching this show\\n\\n\r\nHope my review was helpful\\n\r\nMurphy   \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To make it as blunt as possible, you probably shouldn't watch this show unless a) you're under 16 or b) you're unreasonably obsessed with Louise.\r\nThe premise of this inane little harem romance is that a boy called Saito from modern Japan is sucked into a fantasy world named Halkeginia by an incompetent tsundere witch girl named Louise and becomes her familiar. He is subsequently beset by numerous confessions of love from such starkly original characters as a large-breasted vixen, a demure maid, and a Rei/Yuki clone, but of course, this story is about Louise, and it's her who he ends up with. There's some sortof plot involving a Staff of Destruction, and then later on Louise almost gets married to a moustache, and then the Rei clone goes crazy in the third season, etc., but this show's main focus is putting the male protagonist into WACKY situations like that time he accidentally touched that girl's breast and then Louise used magic to blow him up! Or maybe she whipped him and called him a filthy dog! Oh, those crazy kids!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am in the grossly unenviable position of having watched this as a teenager and have therefore become inextricably attached to Louise, who I will not hear one bad word about. In her defence, Saito is hardly an ideal partner either. Case in point: the fourth and final season, in which Louise and Saito move into a house together, and he insists upon inviting the maid character along with them, not only to live with, but to share their bed. Said maid had at this point been thoroughly flanderised into a sex-obsessed bimbo with nothing on her mind but Saito, and had made it clear to both Louise and Saito that all she wanted was to jump his bones. If you expect a romance that actually progresses, look elsewhere. This is a show for teenage boys, and few outside that demo are likely to appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the romantic development for the first and second seasons is solid enough despite the inevitable harem stupidity. Beyond that, the show is occasionally funny, but more often than not bland and overly reliant on the antics of the stock characters. By the end of the whole series, the humour is wholly absent\u2014or rather, the writers had no more jokes left.\\n\\n\r\nSubtract all of my points if you don't have lewd thoughts about Louise.",

To start off the story was relatively good for only 13 episodes. The way they slowly added pieces to the puzzle definitely kept you enthralled. However, despite this the story was totally predictable and you had almost the whole story figured out about half way to two thirds through, again it was only 13 episodes so I guess that might be reasonable.\r\nThe character models where pretty good I think. Louise' light pinkhair almost made me overlook her incredibly overbearing, selfish personality, which is a common thread in anime of this genre. The background animation was so so at best with rip off's from Harry Potter.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme wasn't too bad and worked well with the story's basic premise of literally starting with a kiss. The background music was actually quite appealing and gave life to some of the short lived fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where the anime looses points for me. The anime is utterly cliche with the same nice guy, mean girl act. Why is it that in 70% of the anime I watch the main protagonist always chooses the girl that treats him the worst, in this case the female lead treats the protagonist like a pet. For example, for all 13 episodes the male lead (Saito) sleeps on the floor on a stack of hey without even a blanket, while the female lead (Louise) sleeps in a luxurious queen size bed. The developers also focus to much on cheap laughs through excessive and unnecessary violence from Louise. To be honest it's not funny and it's just plain annoying I don't understand how they came up with 3 seasons. In a nutshell Saito is a cliche Mr. Nice Guy character who really has no real reason to even endure or like Louise, but still ends up with her in the end, even when there was another character whom he liked and was treated way better by. I just wish once that the protagonist would fall for the underdog instead of the romantically cliche female lead.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it's clear faults I did have a few laughs and overall did feel good after watching it. However, This isn't something I would watch again. Well then again I probably will watch the 2nd season. But trust me their are loads of anime out there with way more depth than this one.",

Zero no Tsukaima is set in a world where you are either a lord and have magical powers, or you are a peasant with no powers and must serve the lords.  During a ceremony where the lords conjure up a pet for life (normally an animal), Louise conjures up a human boy from Japan named Saito.  She treats him like dirt, and forces him to wash her clothes.  How will Saito survive in this new world?\r\n  The art is very poor in this anime, and at first the jokes are reallylame.  But if you can get past the first episode the storyline develops into something that is well worth it.\\n\\n\r\n  P.S.  If you do decide to watch this series, just know that the next 3 seasons were not dubbed due to it not selling well in English.  There are subs and the series completes with the 4th season.",

            "content": "Is this anime worth your time?\r\nMost likely\r\nAnime is a way of expressing a story, which is what it was mainly invented for. This anime does a good job of doing it.\r\nStory - 8\r\nThe story of Zero no Tsukaima is pretty complex, yet simple to take in. There a lot of stuff being set up such as a slowly changing sky, which I didn't even notice was changing until it had importance. Our main character as the synopsis says, Saito cannot return to the real world, so he's stuck with whatever occurs throughout the anime without being able to do anything until he accepts the factthat he can't go back and embraces where he is now. I would call one of these stories a 'passive' story, as things just occur with the main character just reacting with what happens. With a 'passive' story, the anime would rather be dull. However, with several plot twists that occur, all I can say is, \"Wow, I had a bad feeling that would happen\". Some of the plot twists are a bit obvious, while others are very, very slight. This is how you keep a viewer interested, by keeping them engaged, trying to figure out the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation -  8\\n\r\nAlthough this was made in 2006, the art is fantastic. I thought I'd be annoyed with the old school 'huge shine on eye thingy', but it never really bothered me as it actually personified them. No real issues here, nothing too fancy either. Just some simple fire, water and such. As for animation, I'd say it's above average. As for animation, there's nothing fancy here either. Just enough animating to make sense of what's happening. Not very good fighting choreography, however, but you can really feel the power of attacks sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music - 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the background music of this anime. It added so much light/dark to the anime where it was needed. As for sound effect, all were fine and sounded realist enough for me to give to an A. But again, how can we call magic sounds realistic? The sounds just 'work' for the occasion, sounding strong when it's strong, and weak when it's weak.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7\\n\r\nThere IS a HARDCORE TSUNDERE character in here. There's a reason as to why she's tsundere, unlike some anime... Please don't drop animes because a character has 'this trait'. It ruins a lot of good animes out there, including this one. The characters are pretty consistant, but my main problem here is that there isn't a good amount of background information given for the main protagonists, but they give a big background check of a side character. Perhaps she has importance later on, or she's just a filler arc for the anime. We may never know, but this opens up more story telling later on in the episode/series. This might be just me, but I like to get intimate with with main characters to try to relate to them more (no, not that intimate).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI watched this series straight, with breaks to get food, go to the bathroom, and stretch. I wasn't on my toes while watching, but I was always watching, trying to understand characters, origins, and purposes. I was never bored while watching this anime, since each episode presents something fresh and a presentable pace.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nI liked this anime, and I definitely wouldn't say I hated it. If you've ever seen Shakugan no Shana, then you'll probably enjoy this anime. I actually never liked Shakugan no Shana, but there's something about this one that makes it a lot more enjoyable. It probably has something to do with the relations the main characters have and the two worlds.",

            "content": "Zero No Tsukaima is, in my opinion, a good anime i'd recommend to people who like watching adventure animes with romance,magic and comedy in it (like inuyasha). I'd say there are some scenes which are a bit perverted and are rated, but that's what an ecchi anime is, right?\r\nStory:\r\nA wizard named Louise Francoise Blanc de La Valliere isn't exactly your average wizard. She is lousy at performing spells and when she attempts to conjure one, something ends up exploding. During a sacred school ritual where she is supposed to summon her lifetime companion and protector called a familiar, she ends up summoning a Japanese human,Saito.In the end, Louise is stuck with Saito whether she likes it or not and vice versa.\\n\r\nI'd say the story is  a common one. The main protagonist who is supposed to be someone &quot;special&quot; is a failure at being so, yet later on, you get to know that actually, she's got lots of potential and is stronger than most of the othersl. After all, she's the protagonist and protagonists are always heroes, right? The boy (Saito), being a protagonist, has somehow got to have a role,too and has therefore also an awesome power. Both of them fall in love yet there is always the third wheel so it becomes a love triangle.. same old,same old... But i still give it a 7, because the story develops fast and there are some unexpected twists as it goes along.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nI find this anime's animation good; i like the way the characters are drawn, and the backgrounds and surroundings are spectacularly done,too. (for me)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIts sound is ok, the openings and endings i enjoy, and the sound effects during the anime have a good-timing; not an overkilll, but the anime doesn't lack sound effects either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI like Louise's personality a lot: strong, confident and sometimes stubborn. Her character development is good... But what i think lacks is Saito's personality.. i mean, she treats him like a pet, yet he lives with it..? it would've been better if he'd at least disobey her a bit.. you'll see what i mean after watching some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\ni enjoyed this anime a lot, it's one of those animes where you can just kick back and relax, while trying to control yourself not to hit the tv when something exciting happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI think this anime deserves 8 points overall; the two points i don't give it are due to the lack of the story's originality... don't get me wrong, the story's very good, but it's kind of predictable... that's the only problem.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime to anyone who is a fan of adventurous,funny with a romantic feel animes..",

In fact, when I listed the few that I had watched and liked people tried to dissuade me from this genre.\r\nI ended up watching it after marathon watching TTGL and Code Geass for the first time, and then feeling really depressed at the end of both of them. I wanted something silly yet enjoyable and I figured I would give this a try.\r\nAt the beginning of season one I was like... lame. Ican't stand Harry Potter (bear with me, I'm not saying its a Harry Potter knock off), so I was kind of put off by the whole magic school thing. But I stuck through it and ended up watching the whole first season in two sittings. After the first few episodes the characters start to develop a little more, as well as the story. By the end of season one I was watching it for the story more than the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely worth watching, no matter what genre you're into. If you can stomach the beginning you'll start to fall for it, I guarantee it. And if not, hey, you never know until you try.",

            "content": "Hello everyone Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger here and welcome too, my next MVM Entertainment anime review.\r\nThis time I will be reviewing the anime The Familiar of Zero.\r\nNow unlike my Shakugan no Shana review where I reviewed all the seasons I will be only be reviewing the first season of The Familiar of Zero.\r\nWhy you may ask well one I only own the first season of The Familiar of Zero on DVD and secondly at this time of the review I have no interest of watching and reviewing its squeals and from what I been told from my mates told that the squeals for The Familiar ofZero are not that good.\\n\\n\r\nNow The Familiar of Zero are quite a polarising series because I see people whom love the series or downright hate it with the burning passion.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do I think of The Familiar Of Zero?\\n\\n\r\nWell let\u2019s find out shall we.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nthumb-1920-128765\\n\\n\r\nThe story of The Familiar Of Zero are set in a magic school called Tristen Magic Academy where my main heroine Louise are a second year student their.\\n\r\nSadly, for Louise her studies in spell casting are not good at all and all of her attempts at magic end up backfiring in an explosive manner which has earned her the nickname \u201cLouise the Zero.\u201d Too, add insult too, injury in her latest failure in the mystical arts occurred during the familiar summoning ceremony were sorcerers age expected too, call forth an animal companion. Instead of summoning something great like a Dragon or a bear, Louise summons up a teenage boy from Tokyo named Saito and from their the relationship with Louise and Saito beings.\\n\r\nPersonally I found the story of the Familiar of Zero too, be pretty enjoyable for the most.\\n\r\nSure it kinda cliched at times but for what it are its enjoyable too, watch.\\n\r\nAlso the comedy of the Familiar of Zero can be a hit or miss for some but for me the comedy are enjoyable too, some degree but the gag about Saito having too, washing her panties gets really annoying as the season progresses.\\n\r\nAs for the World Building it\u2019s actually quite good. It does a good job exploring the magic aspects, beasts and society of the Tristen Magic Academy.\\n\r\nLastly the pacing for this season are good and it really help the season because not only this are more of a character driven series but it also builds up too something in the last couple of episodes of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story are decent but enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nNow I been told from my mates that Lousie are the worst tsundere girl and too, be honest she\u2019s not that bad. Sure at times she can be annoying with her abuse behaviour too, Saito and also she are loud and whinny but for the most part she\u2019s a meh character overall. I can definitely see people hate her but as for me I found her too, be tolerable at best.\\n\r\nNext we have are Saito whom are you typical generic ecchi shounen, brave, protective and never wanting too, give up. I have nothing else too, say about him because that\u2019s what he literally does in this anime. He\u2019s a generic character whom does generic things.\\n\r\nThe rest of the character cast are also generic ecchi characters whom also do generic ecchi things.\\n\r\nBut hey least they enjoyable too, watch unlike the cast of Love Hina.\\n\r\nIn short this character cast are nothing but generic.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation.\\n\\n\r\nVisually The Familiar of Zero are decent with a standard looking world and character deigns. Sure theyre are some good actions scenes every now and then but the most part the art and animation are standard tier expect for the fights.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the Familiar of Zero are actually good and it really fits with the mood and atmosphere of the anime. It\u2019s honestly the best thing about this whole anime in my opinion.\\n\r\nWe got some great tracks such as Good Friends, Louise's theme, Gandaaruvu, Seiso, Hajirai and those tracks alone made this anime more enjoyable.\\n\r\nThe opening are great and very catchy and the ending theme are cute but are not that catchy.\\n\\n\r\nNow for Sub or Dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub are honestly mediocre and all of the voice actors did a decent too, mediocre performance on the roles.\\n\r\nAs for the sub. Rie Kugimiya as Louise was great and it was easily the best performance from this anime. As for the others are fairly standard.\\n\r\nIf you planning too, watch The Familiar of Zero. Go with the sub because the squeals don\u2019t have a dub opinion at all.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nThe Familiar of Zero are a generic but enjoyable time-waster series if you have nothing too, watch.\\n\r\nThe story was meh, character are mediocre too, decent, art/animation are decent, a nice soundtrack and the dub are okay.\\n\r\nPersonally I don\u2019t think this show are that bad or great too, be honest because this show are just decent and harmless.\\n\r\nOnly buy The Familiar of Zero on a sale because buying the Familiar of Zero brand new on blu ray. along with its squeals are like buying Assassin\u2019s Creed Unity Notre Dame Edition on launch. It\u2019s totally not worth it too, be honest.\\n\r\nI currently own this on DVD and I brought it for \u00a35 which are the most appropriate price for the series for this.\\n\\n\r\nI give Familiar of Zero a 6/10 (It\u2019s your everyday generic ecchi series that are enjoyable too, watch if you have nothing too, watch at all)\\n\\n\r\nThe Familiar Of Zero are available from MVM Entertainment in the UK and they currently licensed all four seasons on DVD and Blu Ray.\\n\\n\r\nAnime recommendations\\n\\n\r\nShakugan No Shana\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba\\n\\n\r\nToradora\\n\\n\r\nDog Days\\n\\n\r\nSlayers\\n\\n\r\nHayate The Combat Butler\\n\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor my next MVM Entertainment anime review I will be doing a straw poll of what anime you guys want me too review and if that anime wins I will review that anime. Please stay tune for that.\\n\r\nAlternatively you can visit my profile and go too my straw poll link and you can vote from they're.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway this was Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger and I will see you guys next time.",

            "content": "STATUS FILE:[ imgur.com/m0PvQNw.png ]\r\nOTHER STATUS AT BOTTOM\r\nTHIS IS A REVIEW OF ALL 4 SEASONS: ZnT, FnK, PnR + F.\r\nSTORY\r\n\tThe story starts in Hogwarts with a young witch named Louise. There is a ceremony being held for the students to summon their 'familiar' who will stay with them as their servant for the rest of their lives. All the other students have already summoned their's, ranging from fire salamander to a giant diglet. However, when Louise, who is renowned for being shit at magic, tries she summons a fricking human. Even so, everyone seems to thin this is the short straw and Louise is not impressed,which doesn't make sense since he is by far the most useful out of any of them. Anyone, for the rest of the anime Louise and her familiar (Saito) go on a load of wacky adventures with elves, dragons, airships and loads of BDSM.\\n\r\n\tAfter fucking around and saving the world once or twice the story just ends. Without closure on just about anything except that Louise is most definitely a sadistic freak. SPOILERS[Remember that fucking ring thing with the water fairy? Yeah, so do I, but the authors didn't]\\n\r\n\tHowever, there is a possible reason for not many people shitting all over this anime too much. The original LN author, Noboru Yamaguchi, died before writing the last two books, leaving his kouhai too attempt to finish things up. And so I guess this time it can be forgiven, as at least Saito x Louise got pretty much canon, but then again, it was from about episode 6 (out of 50).\\n\r\n\tAnother, important plot point is the violence shown. Us anime viewers are well accustomed to people being shot, cut in half, and killed in many ways. However, for whatever reason I, and many other viewers, found some of the stuff in ZnT hard to watch. And it wasn't the actual fight scenes, as they were very toned down, but the sheer amount of tsundere-induced domestic violence, Saito is subject to intense uncensored whipping sessions which he doesn't even seem to mind all that much. However he does get Louise back by performing the most dramatic male bitch slaps ever to come out of anime. [youtu.be/5-ncqu5rYcY?t=25s] Glorious.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe cast is as big as you'd expect from a 4 season anime, the main character is Saito, who I'd rank slightly higher than your average MC, but still incredibly flawed. But he can fly a fighter plane so that's cool.\\n\r\n\tLouise is the main heroine and love interest, who is an A class tsundere, and extreme caution should be taken when in the range of her whip.\\n\r\n\tSaito also acquires a respectable harem, including the maid Siesta; dandere Tabitha; literal slut Kirche, oppai-elf Tiffania and Henrietta, the queen of the entire country.\\n\r\n\tThere are a load of others, but honourable mention to Jean-sensei, who was the best character up to and including 'the event with him as the main part of it'. Afterwards he is just as shit as most of them.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe plot was decent, however cannot be enjoyed by anyone who remembers anything before two episodes ago or has any interest in world lore or continuity in general. Also (very) decent fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nPRODUCTION\\n\r\n\tThis show is a very JC-style one, with that showing in the animation. A standard, unchanging reasonable quality, albeit with slightly dodgy looking action scenes. Not much to say on animation though, it was decent but nothing special by any means.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe OST consisted of four OPs, all of which very nice. The EDs were of a higher quality than your average, with ED2, 'Suki Kirai! Suki!!!', being the best Sound Track of them all. The total track size is relatively small, but not noticeably.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\n\tIf you like long romances, vanilla fantasy and tsunderes or you just enjoy yourself a good bit of BDSM, then watch it, if not then don't force yourself too. Just watching the first season is cool too, as it wraps up pretty nicely in and of itself. If you've seen similar shounen JC Staff shows like Shakugan no Shana or Railgun, then its on the same street as those.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe if the author decides to make like [CENSORED] and pull some bullshit 'not dead' shit then he could Saito bitch slap that faggot who fucked up the ending. Rest in Peace.\\n\\n\r\nMETA\\n\r\nLength- \t4 cours / 50 eps / 20 hrs\\n\r\nRelease-\tSummer 2006, Summer 2007, Summer 2008 & Winter 2012\\n\r\nStudio-\tJC Staff\\n\r\nSource-\t2004 LN by Noboru Yamaguchi\\n\\n\r\nRATING\\n\r\nWatch?-\t\t\tNah\\n\r\nBest Character-\tJean-sensei\\n\r\nWorst Character-\tYaoi bait Julio\t\\n\r\nBest Feature-\t\tTop class domestic violence\\n\\n\r\nFUTATSU NO KISHI:[ imgur.com/tqEUoTL.png ]\\n\r\nPRINCESSES NO RONDO:[ imgur.com/YLU0khz.png ]\\n\r\nF:[ imgur.com/esC2Ymq.png ]",

            "content": "And here we goes, another isekai combined with comedy anime. I would definitely say that 80% of travel to another world is a comedy as base. With the same combination of characters like: smart, dumb, justice, easily triggered and so on. And with not too much to expect, we have a random Tokyo dude who is full of social justice teleported into this land of mystery and got himself some juicy power and a harem.\r\nStory - 7/10 :the story is actually not too shabby but easily expected, instead of the demon lord fighting, the antagonists are just a guy who tries to get more powerand conquer the world. the entire series are mostly illustrated in a light-hearted way, with a laugh or two in every episode even if in the last  couples where atmosphere got rather heavier. And personally i quite enjoyed that the story was set in a magic school, it was quite similar the magic school city in the Magi second season, where the entire school was counted as a country if i still remember correctly.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10: the art...was ok. maybe it is a tiny bit old fashioned where some character are drawn with overlarge eyes and with pretty weird MC haircut. but its just a opinion, because i know some people who likes this kind of art style better than the modern moe style which i cant really describe. however, on the other hand, everything else looked nice and clean, especially the landscapes and scenery when the protagonist were travelling.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10: despite the comedy harem setting, the anime have some pretty fabulous OSTs. i cant remember where but when i heard that piano and violin duet, it was quite a moment. music can really decide if the scene is good or not, it decides if the scene is sad, joyful or excited. its like watching a depressing movie with random DJ song playing in the background while the protagonist is crying. it really makes a difference if the background music was chosen correctly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10: As i mentioned above, the characters were built lightly, with a classic personality but without originality. MC who are filled with justice and romance problems and side characters who are nothing but a laugh. i really cant say more about the characters, but you just need to watch it your self to know what i meant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i gave it a 7/10 which i think is completely fine with it. not high enough to make it overrated but not low enough to cause objection. i would recommend to anyone who just want to watch some fantasy comedy for no other reason but just to waste some time and have a laugh.",

            "content": "Zero no Tsukaima is a very enjoyable anime series that was well worth the \r\ntime to put into. It's one of those animes that had a lot to tell in 49 episodes, not rushed like some animes that only have 20+ episodes, sometimes leaving viewers in dismay of how short a good show could be. \r\nZero no Tsukaima begins with the main female protagonist, Louise de La Valliere is the dunce of her class in Tristein Academy for magicians. Several years of unsuccessful attempt after attempt at casting spells, each resulting in violent explosions, have earned her the nickname of \u201cZero Louise\u201d from her classmates.However, on the day that her class must summon a familiar each for themselves, Louise summons a commoner from another world: a young boy from Japan named Hiraga Saito, ultimately forming a bond and becomes the main male protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals in general, including sound and artwork is somewhat not the best as I would anticipate. It's not Final Fantasy-ish beautiful with breathtaking quality, but I would say it's pretty decent. Not much to say since there's not much to be bashing about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, creatively crafted for some, maybe a few were kinda cut-and-paste deal with some of them. I took great pleasure and joy in seeing Saito and Louise make names for themselves going from Zero's to Hero's both in their own rights. I can say I felt sad for some characters, especially Siesta because she is in a one sided love with Saito while Louise is in the way. But there are some redeemable characters like Guiche, Kirche, Tabitha, they're just the perfect supporting side players in the plot, sometimes shining in some scenes with some epic fights. As a honest guy, I liked Kirche a lot, especially because of her sexy looks and most of all, she's just perfect in the typical harem anime. Although they're not unique characters, their personalities are just humorous, especially how Saito is a pervert along with many other characters to sum it up. \\n\\n\r\nThe replay value is not the best for some out there in my opinion. Some might not enjoy Harry Potter-esque shows like Zero no Tsukaima, but this romance comedy is just classic! I have found myself literally crying from laughter because of how funny some moments can be. Every episode makes me look foward to the next, leaving a feeling of satisfaction. I will admit some things in this anime can be predictable, but as a person who finished the entire series, this one is a keeper! \\n\\n\r\nI don't believe in perfection unless it's something like Final Fantasy VII or Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, but this anime is just very enjoyable. Perfect length to be an amazing series in 49 episodes, not rambling on like Naruto and Pokemon. And this is a very cute anime, especially on a person like me who has a penchant for romance series. This is fantasy based, so if those seek some more realistic ones, I would recommend ToraDora or Kaichou Maid-Sama, or even Angel Beats. Deep down, I really suggest you guys to give this one a chance, just once! This anime might be kinda awkwardly funny, maybe even cliched at moments, but the whole anime is very heartwarming and emotional! Some characters can be bland, one-dimensional, but the loving relationship between Louise and Saito is just beautiful in this romantic comedy!",

The visual quality is really bad taking into consideration that it's not that old of an anime.\r\nThe character development is almost non existent and for the ones that do develop it is really bad. A lot of characters make an appearance without the proper relations to the story and that makes it almost idiotic.\r\nExcept for one case, everyone is either good or evil so you know whereit's going to end with anyone.\\n\r\nThe music is really stupid and even though it goes with the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of the show it could have been a lot better (believe me, I'm being pretty generous).\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the reason I enjoyed his show despite all and every bad aspect is because of it sense of humor.

            "content": "Fair Warning:\r\nA not-so-long mixed review about Zero no Tsukaima that is intended for people who have watched it. If you are a fan of the series that rated it as a 9/10 or something, I suggest that if you proceed on reading this, that you keep an open mind and try to think of my point of view.\r\nSo without further ado, let's begin.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nSo, first things first, a story about a boy, a 17 year old boy, who suddenly got Isekai'd while he was casually walking down the sidewalk like any normal human would do.  He was sumoned by this pink haired girl(loli) namedLouise, who also happens to be a Noble in their magical world, which is sort of a magical version of Europe, I've watched stuffs like this before. Anyway, now that Saito is summoned in this world, he must now live his life as a \"familiar\" of this pink haired girl called Louise. They sealed the \"contract\" using a kiss, how uncommon. Anyway things take off from there and basically, this boy, Saito, is treated like shit, less than human, like a dog even, repeatedly, basically almost everyday, how enticing right? Getting isekai'd as a mere \"Peasant\" no less. And who treats him like this you ask? No other than his \"master\" Pink-Haired Girl Le Blanc de La Valli\u00e8re. I'm not gonna go any more deeper on this, basically, things happen, bad things from here and there, bad guys appear here and there, some other stuffs, and then they fuc-, erhm, fell in love with each other. What's more is that this was happening while there was a choice for him to go back to his normal life and quit being a slave, but nah man, he fell in \"love\". Then he gets treated like shit again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI have watched a fair amount of anime from this time period,  the art is about what you'd expect, more or less. But if, maybe, just maybe, the budget was increased a little more, maybe it'd look better. Like Jigoku Shoujo, as far as I can remember, the art of this show was good. But the good points of this anime is that they try to show the fight scenes with much action as needed, and the animation doesn't get affected badly. So, I think it's good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the OP and the ED. But I liked the OP better, it basically brings back memories, ah the nostalgia. Anyway, the sound effects were cool and all. The voice acting of the VA of Louise was the one that I liked the most, nothing less from Kugiyama Rie.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s): 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOh man, this is where I get mixed feelings about, more on the negative side though. Especially with Le Blanc de La Valli\u00e8re, AKA Louise the ZERO. I understand her situation, the fact that she's a noble and all, but boy, do she knows how to treat a human like shit. From being whip-happy (In her defense, there were some times were he deserved it, but too much is still too much) to making him sleep on the floor with only hay as a bedding, oh well, at least Saito isn't on a leash. Except for that one time. Also, this guy Saito, why doesn't he at least try and bring several things up with his \"Master\" about his treatment and all. Even after they became a \"couple\", he still gets treated like shit, and gets whipped. What was all that \"character development\" all about if these things happen again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't say that I enjoyed this anime that much, but there are some parts that I enjoyed it, the rare cute parts of Louise being \"dere\" to Saito and the parts where he used things from the human world. But there's just too many negative things that I failed to ignore about the show. The biggest negative thing would be the character development with each other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was on my mind for a long time, and I don't, in the slightest, regret watching it. It's not a waste of time like those anime that I've watched that I felt my brain rot and degrade over time just by watching it. I would recommend you to watch it if you could ignore the points that I pointed out above, other than that, I can say that the anime can be passed as good, if we weigh in all the good and bad things.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This Review is only exclusive to the FIRST SEASON (S1) and not, in any way related to the other seasons of the series. I plan on watching the others when I get the time.\\n\r\nThat is all and thank you for reading.\\n\\n\\n",

I put the series on hold at episode 9 because I got fed up with how obvious everything was. Overall, this is a good tsundere rom-com if you're not interested in a complicated storyline.",

            "content": "I began Zero no Tsukaima since it was labeled as a fantasy, but it quickly brought out the ecchi fan I had never known!\r\nThe story follows a chain of somewhat ridiculous coincidences that kept me laughing continually as the series went on. There was good drama and occasionally some fun adventurous/actiony pieces.\r\nCharacters:\r\nHonestly, the characters did it for me in this series. You have Louise, who works very hard to keep up a good face and prove herself a worth mage, while continually failing. You can see how she takes out her feelings of shortcoming on Saito, whom she has a love hate relationship with. ThenSaito, who is just the unlucky guy who fell out of the sky into Tristain who is struggling with understanding the world he is now stuck in, and understand his feelings for his 'master', Louise. Then throw in Siesta, the good girl-better choice-adorable servant; Tabitha, the silent-studious-super power; Guiche, the womanizing-overly confidant; and of course Kirche, the always horny-boobs. Throw them all in a bag, shake it up and there's bound to be plenty of room for laughs.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story, I'll admit, get loose at various times. There is always the sense of Saito trying to discover what his place is in the new world, and how to get back to his world. Then there is the ongoing battle of who Saito should be in love with along with his feeling that he should protect everyone regardless of their class. It takes the series a little while to develop a genuine evil-antagonist, which makes the overall story sail better (now that all the characters we like seem to have a common goal) but up until that point, I was willing to forgive that thanks to all the constant mini-fights between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nDrama:\\n\r\nI loved the awkward feelings and uncertainty that were present in almost all the character relationships. I won't lie, I occasionally got mad a Saito when it seemed like he finally smoothed things out with Louise, only for him to fawn over someone else, but without his endless distractions, the fun and funny tension would have been gone.\\n\\n\r\nThemes:\\n\r\nThe show is a comedy-ecchi more than anything else, but there are a few deeper themes present in the show that make it further interesting. What role does pride play in how we live. Equality amongst people of different classes. How do we communicate love to the people that matter to us. Most of the themes appear only fleetingly, but they still make you think for that brief moment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed the show. Zero no Tsukaima:\\n\r\n* delivers on the drama\\n\r\n* catches the watcher's curiosity (both in story and in characters)\\n\r\n* provides plenty of laughs\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good, misguided love story.",

            "content": "Well, here comes Zero no Tsukaima, a harem-type anime with a tsundere for a main heroine. Another harem anime? Haven\u2019t we had enough of this already? Yep, here\u2019s another anime with a clich\u00e9 characters, a subpar plot, and a ridiculous amount of fanservice. What? Seriously? Yes, seriously. Zero no Tsukaima is just another one of those terrible animes that people would consider crap. But why? Wasn\u2019t  J.C. Staff the one who made this anime? I mean, J.C staff was pretty successful with Toradora! Wasn\u2019t it? Well you see, Zero no Tsukaima is one of those \u201cfailures\u201d, so to speak. It failed in almost everyaspect and is actually a terrible anime despite its huge fanbase. Why is that you ask? Well, I\u2019ll give you the reasons why. Also, I would like you to know that this would be a review for the entire series and not just for this season. Now let\u2019s move on to the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The all-important story. Every anime needs a good, gripping story to entertain its viewers right? Well unfortunately, Zero no Tsukaima( which I will just abbreviate to ZnT for simplicity\u2019s sake.) failed to deliver this all-important part of an anime. To tell you frankly, it had a great concept of what it was going to be. A simple summary of the story would be that Saito, a normal, everyday teenager was suddenly dragged into an unknown world and made a familiar by a magician nicknamed as Zero Louise, due to her lack of talent in using magic. It then turns out that the reason Louise can\u2019t use magic efficiently Is because she only excels in a special, legendary type of magic which is void magic and that Saito is the knight of legend, Gandalfr. From that simple summary, one can guess that this would be an epic tale about two legends, trying to fulfill their destinies while encountering numerous hardships along the way, all while developing a romantic relationship between the two. Unfortunately though, the author just decided to go \u201cFuck that shit, who needs a decent plot when we got a tsundere main heroine, a pevert main hero, lots of tits and an entire harem at our disposal?\u201d Yes, this is exactly what happened to ZnT. Instead of creating an intricate and enjoyable story and focusing on developing the plot, they just decided to give us a crap ton of fanservice, tits, a harem, and then proceeded to screw up the plot and rely on half-baked comedy and tits to try and hook its viewers. Although this would have worked if done correctly, even the comedic side was done half-baked.  One of the running gags in ZnT is that the MC, Saito, is an idiot who cannot seem to be able to hold in his boner and literally just drools of every boob he sees, and then proceeds to get dragged into the most awkward circumstances, and then gets beaten up by Louise. It was funny the first time but after seeing it in every single episode that had a scene wherein the MC interacts with a girl (which is like every fucking episode) it got old so much that it only served to annoy me every time it happens. So yeah, the comedy part was pretty horrid, but what exactly happened to the plot then? Well, as you would expect, the plot turned into a complete mush that only serves to further Saito\u2019s harem(I would explain his harem later) and to create more opportunities for them to insert their stupid gag instead of actually developing the plot. I mean seriously, the plot had more plotholes than there are pimples on a boy going through puberty and had as much plot development as a porn flick. Yes, it\u2019s that terrible. But seriously though, the series doesn\u2019t even have a proper antagonist. In each season, a new antagonist is introduced, then they try to set up a scene where the MCs will fight the antagonist, only for the antagonist to be killed/go MIA in an instant, never to be seen or mentioned in the story ever again. So for short, not only doesn\u2019t ZnT have a proper plot, it also doesn\u2019t have a proper antagonist. The last thing that I would like to mention is about the lack of details and proper explanations in ZnT. Now, this is a common problem among a lot of animes, but ZnT just took it to new extremes. There are so many instances wherein inexplicably unbelievable things just happen. It seems that every time something bad happens, some incredible \u201ccoincidences\u201d just happen for some reason. Like for example, in one instance, MC Saito is trapped in a room with only a brick wall separating him from his enemies and apparent death, but then guess what? MC Louise \u201caccidentally\u201d learns teleportation magic and teleports him and his friends to safety. Such ridiculous plot armor only exists in fairy tales, and in my opinion it is completely retarded to even try to incorporate them into anime. To sum it all up, I give it a 4/10, just because it is utterly ridiculous up to the point that they might as well add \u201cthe power of love\u201d as one their plot armors. Oh wait, they already did, Stupid me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As I\u2019ve said before, ZnT is an anime focused on making scenarios wherein they could add ecchi and add more members to Saito\u2019s harem. As such, one can expect that the characters are really bland. For one, there is ABSOLUTELY no character development in this anime, none whatsoever. I mean seriously, the main character Saito, a perverted, two-timing  guy who has as much sex appeal as Makoto from school days is still the same character he is four seasons after he appeared. Louise, a tsundere loli who only is Saito\u2019s master and supposed \u201clover\u201d is still the same stereotype anime girl who always gets into trouble and has to be saved by Saito. Then there\u2019s Siesta, a typical maid who becomes a bitch after she falls in love Saito turns into a slutty bitch after who does absolutely nothing but press her boobs onto Saito in hopes of getting noticed after four seasons. After that, there\u2019s Tabitha, your typical silent, mysterious girl stereotype that has as many expressions as Kristen Stewart who is still the same girl she is after four seasons, with the exception of being able to blush and sneaking into Saito\u2019s bed while hoping to get laid or something(no really I\u2019m serious). Then comes in Princess Henrietta, a stereotype girl who seems refined and stoic outside, but apparently has a habit of seducing our MC Saito whenever no one\u2019s around. And finally, Tiffania, your typical air-headed girl with huge, f-cup boobs that always gets into \u201cunfortunate\u201d accidents with the MC is still the same air-headed girl with huge tits when the story ends. You see, there\u2019s your problem; The supposed main characters are all bitches who could all have had a good, deep personality in them are all reduced into mere bitches who fight over Saito\u2019s attention. Now, although there a lot of instances wherein their characters could\u2019ve been fleshed out, like when their back story is explored in an arc, what the anime does instead is to make the girls seem all helpless and make Saito save them and as a result, they fall in love with him. Heck, I even think that some of the side characters have deeper personalities and are more fleshed out than the actual MC\u2019s. I mean, Agnes and Colbert, two side characters had an ENTIRE arc dedicated to them just to reveal their back stories and were actually given a good introduction and excellent character development, all done with good execution but were just thrown away into the sidelines, only appearing thrice or four times in each season after their arc were finished. Now, there\u2019s the problem. Instead of focusing their efforts on developing the main characters, they put their efforts in developing characters that would barely appear in the series while they could have given all that effort into fleshing out the main characters or even at least removing Saito\u2019s inability to reject a girl\u2019s advances especially since he\u2019s already in a relationship. And top it all off, even the antagonist are just plain terrible and don\u2019t stick around for long, as I\u2019ve mentioned before. With all of those blunders, the only score I could give it is a 3/10, since pretty much every character are just about as interesting as one of those singing birthday cards; fun at first, but just damn annoying and noisy later on.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Pretty much the only good thing in this anime. Animation was smooth and shiny, just the way I like it. Although just like everything in this anime, there is always something lacking. The action scenes are so dull, it\u2019s almost a bore to watch them. While fight scenes are supposed to be epic and adrenaline-inducing, the fight scenes in ZnT is just about as dull as watching someone else brush their teeth. It\u2019s so slow that it almost look like it\u2019s from a children\u2019s cartoon show. So even with the animation, I can\u2019t give it a perfect score due to the failure on the part of the animators, so instead I\u2019ll just give it a 7/10 and be done with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: There really isn\u2019t much to say about the sound except that all of the BGMs were reused from the first season till the end and that the openings are pretty much sound just the same, only with different lyrics. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite all of the negative comments I put up there, I actually enjoyed the first season. After that though, everything went downhill and my hopes of seeing a new masterpiece were completely shattered. But still though, I will take into consideration that I enjoyed \u00bc of this anime so I guess giving it a 3/10 is good enough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In conclusion, I would like to say that Zero no Tsukaima could\u2019ve been a great anime. Unfortunately, all of that potential was wasted on a subpar plot, mediocre characters, and lame humor. To all those who are planning to watch this, only watch it if you are a die-hard tsundere fan or just watch the first season since the rest are crap. Overall I give it a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any comments, please post a comment on my page. I will gladly receive any criticism, good or bad and I will try my best to reply to your comment. Thanks for reading my review :))\\n",

If you're annoyed by Louise's rudeness in the beggining but can enjoy a love story stay tuned because she gets better as the show progresses. I wouldn't have even written a review as i'm not finished yet but i noticed this site says theres only 13 episodes when i'm at episode 18 (although there are only 13 dubbed episodes ie 1 season there are 3 extra seasons subbed)  I'll update my review when i'm finished with final thoughts but maybe if someone in charge on this site could fix that it would probably be smart.",

            "content": "Zero no Tsukaima is a fitting anime to watch if you are a lolicon masochist with a S&M fetish and your greatest dream in life is to have your face pressed under a girl's boots. If you're not, you might find it as an overly sadistic attempt at a slapstick comedy with an absurd romance, a bit of ecchi and the average boy getting a harem formula.\r\nGeneric Ikari Shinji knock-off Saito gets summoned into a fantasy world to serve as the familiar of a zero-talent loser mage, Louise. This fantasy world has a Middle Ages social setting with nobles, who can use magic, and peasants,who can't. And feudal kingdom setting to build up some background political drama to avert attention from this show's main theme. Anyways, Saito is instantly labeled a peasant and finds himself forced to become Louise's slave. And except for a few magic tricks he uses, thus getting Siesta (a maid, best girl) and Kirche (noble girl, slutty but decent compared to the female lead) to droll over him, and a few situations where he makes a difference, Saito is nothing but a loser with a strong Stockholm Syndrome who doesn't even want to return to Japan that much. As for Louise, I can only say that if most main girls are irritating with their tsundere antics, she is downright the worst female lead I have watched in a while. Louise is not even a tsundere, she is just a spoiled child too indoctrinated by her feudal status that she fails to even regard Saito as a human being, much less try to understand his circumstances, coming from a world where humans are equal in rights and chances. Either too hot or too cold; she lets him see her naked or even dress her up while she would wipe or even starve him at the slightest mistake. Good luck in getting some cheap generical prophecy and politics for a plot to cover that up.\\n\r\nI was only able to find Siesta slightly likeable out of all characters, even though she is more or less the typical Japanese maid (she is of Japanese origin through a great-grandfather, as to have that trope make more sense \ud83d\ude02).\\n\\n\r\nI won't comment on the animation, considering this is a 2006 anime after all, as for the sound, I wonder if it was there in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSo, you're a masochist and want an anime to fulfill your domination fetish? Suit your needs.",

            "content": "So Zero no Tsukaima is centered around Saito, the male protagonist, who was an ordinary teenage boy living in Japan before he was suddenly summoned by a student at Tristain Academy of Magic known as Louise, or as she was called in the beginning of the series by her classmates, Louise the Zero. \r\nStory\r\n9/10\r\nThe story, I thought, was fine. It had plenty of comedy as well as romance, and I really liked the harem that Saito had with all the main female characters; albeit, some episodes had a lot of different genres coming in at once.\r\nIt was easy for me to follow along and overall,the story wasn't too jumble or anything.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the animation in Familiar of Zero, it's the kind that I prefer. The colors were appropriate and the backgrounds were to be expected in an fantasy type of anime, however, it made it all the better for me to really get into it.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nI find the voices are well chosen (you can't go wrong with Kugimiya Rie voicing a tsundere character) and the op's and endings were awesome and are worth listening to. Also, I loved the music that would play in the background for certain scenes, they all really fitted and gave each scene the appropriate feel.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought the character's were well developed and there were no sudden personality changes or anything, however, they were very original. I love how Louise never failed to give a tsundere moment, but at the same time, I like how she gave the impression of nobility (she should since she comes from a noble family)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching Zero no Tsukaima at first, but frankly, I got tired of the numerous ecchi scenes and how some episodes were just 'huh' There was a lot of comedy in it, but almost like there was too much in some cases. There was just enough romance for me, despite some of the romantic scenes being a bit clich\u00e9 and too overused. \\n\\n\r\nI did start to lose interest after the first season, the episodes just seemed to (somewhat) drone on. Even though I wasn't as enthusiastic about watching past the first season, I did, and overall I did enjoy watching Zero no Tsukaima to the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nAlbeit it with all that's been said, I think Zero no Tsukaima is overall a good anime to watch if you like ecchi, romance, comedy, harem, fantasy, batting with magic, and harry potter (no joke this anime will remind you of it) \\n\\n\r\nDespite a 9 overall rating, ZnT has remained one of my favorite animes and honestly, I would recommend it to anyone. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Zero no Tsukaima. One of the few unique animes i watched that let a \"classic\" impression off me. This anime is an example of an fantasy romance done right. As far as the story goes, as guess you could think of it as Harry Potter with the addition of familiars. Even though the story isnt original and isn't all that great, i guess its the world that get's introduced that leaves an good impression. It's a world of magic with wands, dragons, talking swords, lizards, giants, gods like gandalfr, It's a huge world. One of the reasons you get attracted to the anime isto find out and learn more about the world itsself and that drives you to keep on watching. The art isn't anything special. It's not bad, but i wouldn't say it's a masterpiece either. Lets just leave it as good. The sound is decent. I liked the second opening and the fourth opening stood out to me, but other than that, the music was ok. The characters are one of the strong points of this anime. Saito, the main character, gets transported from Tokyo, to the magic world. Having a lot to learn about the new world he's in, there leaves a lot of room for character development, which the animators do a decent job at. Louise, starts off as your typical tsundere who treats Saito as a dog. Character development is done well and she goes through a drastic change in the series. There are other noticeable  characters as well but lets just leave it at that for now\\n\r\nThe romance of the series isnt the best but is still decent. The romance is cute, but it gets annoying how Louise becomes jeolous at every single girl that goes after Saito\\n\r\nThe story,art, and enjoyment would be an 8,sound a 7, and character a 9, giving it an overall score of 8",

            "content": "Do you like tsundere girls? Do you like recycled jokes about boobs and the main character getting caught in misunderstandings and getting blown up in almost every episode? Well this is just a few of the things the first season of 'Zero no Tsukaima' has to offer... \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nIf you were preparing yourself to watch a pants dropping fantasy show with a stunning, jaw dropping plot line, you'll be fairly disappointed. To be honest, there's not much to talk about regarding the story. Throughout the season, there wasn't anything fascinating or amazing about the plot line. If anything, it was pretty cliched and predictable. Withregards to the ending, it really felt a little like deus ex machina and was kind of abrupt. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThere isn't much to talk about in the art department. There wasn't anything stunning or jaw dropping. The animation was decent and fluid, so there wasn't any eye sores throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nIn regards to sound, there was nothing memorable. None of the shows tracks were ear catching or stunning. However, the sounds did set the mood well and were used appropriately. (Additionally, in my opinion, the opening song wasn't that great...)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters were very generic and cliched. You have this tsundere girl named Louise that later develops feelings for Saito Hiraga. Then you have Saito, a generic, Japanese boy that takes the sword and saves the day, totally uninteresting. The side characters don't really do much but add to the stories humor and, occasionally, plot line. Despite there being character development, there wasn't a major impact. The character development felt like the show took a sticker and placed it over table. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nDespite the show being just a decent anime, I found myself enjoying this show a lot more then I thought I would. Something about this show made me want to watch more. Was it because of the shows harem? Maybe it was because of the shows 'misunderstanding' jokes? For me, I enjoyed it because of the pairing. Saito's and Louise's personalities are totally opposite which lead up to some humorous situations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis first season of the show is decent. The art, sound, and voice acting are all decent. All except for the story and the characters, they were pretty mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, this is just the FIRST SEASON of the SHOW.\\n\r\nI highly recommend anyone that gives this show at least a 5 or 6 rating to watch the second season. Though, in my opinion, the second season doesn't fix all the points, it makes an attempt to correct them. And one of the HUGE fixes they make would be in the character development between Louise Fran\u00e7oise and Saito Hiraga. This is a huge point that made the second season of the show, Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi, worth watching.",

This is why I picked it up. And honestly, I don't know what makes me enjoy this anime, but I do.\r\nThe Saito and Louise relationship is a relationship that I really like, but at the same time really hate. If I were Saito, I wouldn't put up with being treated the way Louise is treating him. He still does, and to be fair, Saito isn't the perfect guy either, considering the harem going on and him not really understandingwhat Louise wants.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the relationship progresses in a good way throughout the season, and even more in the next one. And there are really some touching moments throughout the season, which I must say I really enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nNow, it comes to the plot/story. Here I must say I am not too impressed. Suddenly, a big problem erupts, and I am thinking: Ok, this will take some time to fix. 10 minutes later: Oh wow it's done already.\\n\r\nThis is pretty much how much of this anime goes. And for some parts, it can be good, but for others, you wish you would see more epic fighting/magic then you already see. \\n\\n\r\nI can understand why this anime isn't liked by everyone. By some, it might be dull, boring and not entertaining, but for people like me, who really enjoys watching just a goodfeel anime that makes you go aww and yay, with a huge touch of fantasy/harem and some ecchi and some small touches of magic/fighting, I would recommend the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't really live up to it's genres the way to be expected, but I am still watching episode after episode of this, mostly to see how the relationship of Saito and Louise is going to develop, and the story is at times also very exciting.\\n\\n\r\nI will give this anime a 6 purely because I am enjoying it, but it's far from amazing.",

It is hard to focus on other story when the main mistress constantly beats her slave and he gladly accepts a punishment. The story is too repetitive so I dropped it.\r\nThis story doesn't have characters, it has plot devices. So far everybody serves just one purpose what is convenient to story.\r\nI found art average but boobs aren't drawn well, which is what matters in this story most. This show is about boobs, slave touching other girls boobs and mistress punishing him for that.\r\nI donot recall soundtrack which makes it completely forgettable.",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\r\nI often wonder how Zero no Tsukaima received 4 seasons of production.\r\nStory 3/10\r\nThe plot of the show wasn't terrible, but many ideas weren't original at all. There was concepts that was blatantly ripped off from other sources, which was pathetic. Furthermore, a good portion of the season was used displaying the characters as they ventured on their whimsical affairs, seemingly oblivious to the actual plot. The pacing was nice and consistent, though the plot twists were glaringly obvious and failed to captivate.\r\nArt 7/10\r\nThe art was clean and the animation was smooth. Nothing that stood out though.\r\nSound 5/10\r\nThe OP and ED was completely forgettable.\r\nCharacter2/10\\n\r\nThis show had 2 main characters, following Louise and Saito. Both were terrible main characters. Saito is the epitome of bland. He had next to no redeemable qualities, nor interesting character traits. The only distinctive trait was that he was a pervert. Moving on, Louise is easily among the top most dislikable female leads. She is annoying, abrasive, arrogant, dogmatic and terribly temperamental. Yes, she is that bad.\\n\r\n There are only two actual love interests, and the other girls had half-baked relationship development. Speaking of development, almost every character failed to have adequate depth. Zero no Tsukaima would be a stereotype heaven. They used every clich\u00e9 in the book, causing the characters to give off a flat and uninteresting feel.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\r\nEvery moment was awfully predictable, and coupled with the illogicality of the characters, this anime really frustrated me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\r\nZero no Tsukaima was dreadful, and I would not recommend it.",

Then season 2 comes around and you think \"well once again pretty good, but feels a little repetitive\". now season three rolls around and you like \"alright how many times are you gonna do the same thing, this is still entertaining but getting ridiculous\". But at this point dont make the same mistake i did and put off the last season. I cant really placemy finger on what exactly it was, maybe putting all the time into this anime  and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. But of all the anime ive watch (which at this point is about 100) this is the most satisfying last six episodes i have ever seen. it makes you look back at the last three seasons and think \"ok, that was definitely worth it, and really not that bad in the first place\".  Most people who dont like this show cant see past the fan service or repetitive jokes, but if you can i promise it will be worth it.",

            "content": "I am going to review all 3 seasons of ZnT. IMO, S1>S3>S2.\r\nGenres:\r\nFanservice:7 (More in S2)\r\nAdventure:7 (Usually in second part of season)\r\nRomance:4 (Here and there, reminds me of Yume de Aetara manga)\r\nMagic: 5-6 (Depends on season, but magic is quite badly developed, esp for void magic)\r\nEmotional/ Tearjerking moments: 8 (Usually have to do with Louise and Saito)\r\nSeason1:\r\nSynopsis: High school boy gets summoned-> became \"Louise the Zero\"'s familiar->discover Saito's and Louise's power-> Princess' and Louise's history and related happenings->war-> Louise and Saito fight a war\r\nStory:9\r\nVery good, I remembered it is with little fanservice. Perhaps this is the starting, quite a lot of things started got resolved, andstory progression was really good. Emotional, adventurous and funny.\\n\r\nNote:About Saito's and Louise's relationship, it isn't until the end of S1 that they clearly admitted to each other. So in the end we have a nice, quite conclusive ending.\\n\r\nStory progression: Very good\\n\r\nPlot consistency: Very very good. (Only S1 has heavy emphasis on familiars) \\n\r\nCharacter:8\\n\r\nMain characters seem defined with character development. Saito, Louise, Tabitha and (the fire girl)\\n\r\nOverall:9\\n\\n\r\nSeason2:\\n\\n\r\nStory:4\\n\r\nMostly about Reconquista and a war, with some new characters and character development of some side characters.\\n\r\nTabitha and Kirche rarely shows up.\\n\r\nEvery1 became strange, the girls other than Louise were extremely attracted to Saito from ep1. Unexplained.\\n\r\nLouise begins \"bipolar syndrome\", sometimes sweet sometimes cruel.\\n\r\nFanservice (violent type). Adventure. Uneasy atmosphere between Saito and Louise.\\n\r\nStory progression: First few episodes: Very rocky. Second half of S2: Strange.\\n\r\nPlot consistency: Good, but a lot of things not explained.\\n\r\nCharacter:5\\n\r\nCharacter development on Tabitha and Louise well done. A lot of old characters gone for many eps, some new ones go into focus. Hard to tell who are the main characters at times.\\n\r\nOverall:5\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3:\\n\r\nThis is probably the most surreal out of the 3 seasons. \\n\r\nStory:8\\n\r\nReconquista were not mentioned at all, although the leader escaped. No explanation.\\n\r\nRing of Wisdom (?) also has no mention. New concepts were introduced but never explained.\\n\r\nNew characters show up, old characters return, but very little familiars are present, most of the fights are with magic.\\n\r\nFan-service is still quite abundant, albeit being smoother than S2's and more focused on ecchi.\\n\r\nLouise becomes more heavily \"bipolarised\", and shift of mood between her being bossy and proud vs insecure and humble becomes more unbearable. \\n\r\nLouise's and Saito's unstable relationship seem similar like those 2 in Yume de Aetara.\\n\r\nA lot of parts in the season are very abstract only giving a faint picture of the entire situation.\\n\r\nSecond-half adventure features friendship and teamwork, gives shounen feel.\\n\r\nFanservice (ecchi). Harem becomes larger. Incomplete feeling. Emotional Tabitha arc.\\n\r\nStory progression: Smooth, enjoyable\\n\r\nPlot consistency: Very weak, sometimes jumping here and there\\n\r\nCharacter:4\\n\r\nOther than introduction of new characters (which are usually big-breasted) and reappearance of old characters, not much done for character development.\\n\r\nNever-seen-characters sometimes take front stage, when we barely know them.\\n\r\nNice portrayal of Louise being insecure about Saito but some things regarding her not explained.\\n\r\nOld Osmand only appeared once or smth in entire season.\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\\n\r\n[For all 3 seasons]\\n\r\nZnT basically is about a couple with numerous difficulties due to harem and  their personalities. The problems they face makes the series interesting.\\n\r\nSomehow, the anime after the first season seems a bit diluted on content, and more concentrated on fan-service and a lighter atmosphere. Some crucial scenes were quickly moved over.\\n\\n\r\nStory:6\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nClear art. Advanced techniques used to make eyes look more sad etc. Facial expressions were good. Action scenes were excellent.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nI love S1's OP and ED, and S3's OP. I like S2's OP but something seems to be missing. Sound effects were average, but voice acting was stellar, especially Louise's and Saito's, since they were in a lot of emotional scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nS1 and S3 are great, I do not like S2 much. The fights, the comedy, the relationship problems between Saito and Louise were great. Friendship and loyalty are greatly treasured in ZnT.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\r\nGood 3-season series. Go read light novel, i'm quite sure it's much better than the anime in terms of plot for S2 onwards.\\n\r\nIf you like the romance in this anime, try Yume de Aetara (manga).\\n\\n\r\nPS.The official score is reflection of all 3 seasons.",

It felt like no one was even trying to be interesting. \r\nStory: most of it is dead obvious, but the way the real world mashes up with the magical world is interesting enough for me to give it a 5. Political intrigue does ensue, sidelined by cheesy plot, fan service and pointless shenanigans trying to make up for the bad characterisation. The romance feels forced for the most part. \r\nIf you're looking for something to pass thetime while being brain dead, go for it. Perfect for little kids, I suppose?",

Having ALL of them in one series will make the anime UNFORGETTABLE.\r\nI first watched the series when it first came out back in 2006. It was fun-filled, action-packed, full of fan services. There was never a moment of dullness with the antics of Saito and Louis.\r\nHowever, looking at the overall plot, there were a lot of unanswered questions. Things felt rushed to the end. Luckily it was caught up with the sequels to shine more details into the overall story.\r\nSo if you are looking for a light-weight anime with plentyof laughters, Zero no Tsukaima is something you can start. Especially when it features Kugumiya Rie who voiced Shana from Shakugan no Shana",

            "content": "Magic is cool. Everyone loves magic. Having real magic, the stuff of fantasy is almost every child's dream.\r\nZero no Tsukaima is a rather hasty story that looks like it was at first originally to be a much longer first season as most of it is character development that suddenly, half way through, turns into everything is happening and then ending again all within one or two episodes leaving the finale rather lack lusting as you expected something more spectacular than was given. It opens a lot of question and leaves a lot of them unanswered as they go parading around the place, learning of manythings but never really question why.\\n\\n\r\nArt is fairly par as nothing really stood out in its 13 episodes. colors and cell shading is basic stuff and even the scenery looks made of the same stuff not being something of awe which is rather lacklustering considering how much landscape is shown.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is subtle but decent. It's used to empower the scenes and convey the correct atmosphere, but not at a pace that makes it stand out which isn't a bad thing. However it is noted there is some stock sample music which is rather disappointing. Sounds are rather basic as reused multiple times which almost makes it seem this anime had a low budget to start with,\\n\\n\r\nCharacters left a lot to be desired. There is still much untold about the main characters and the only back story we've heard is of an MC's classmate. However the development between the Hero and Heroine is easily seen and steadily grows.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was so-so. It makes you laugh but it also makes you wish it would sometimes move on to something more meaningful or interesting. Don't be surprised if you reach the last episode of the season and wonder is that really all there was. It produced such a beautifully large potential story then cut it off at the hips with such a sudden ending",

It was interesting and funny enough to keep me going, but it's missing something special for me to say that it was magnificent. I have to say though that Season 2 'Zero no Tsukaima: Futaki no Kishi' was the best. It kept everything to a good balance and the ending was amazing. Only to be spoiled by its sequels. Season 4 'Zero no Tsukaima F' was a close second. It tried toreplicate all that was good of Season 2, but you can't expect the audience to fall for the same thing again. BUT what Season 4 had was a good and solid conclusion to the series.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Wouldn't recommend it, but a good watch nonetheless. Stopping after Season 2 would make the experience better.",

            "content": "Ah. Zero no Louise. That one will never get old.\r\nThis anime is a combination of:\r\n- BDSM (Lots of Master/Slave stuff: whipping, humiliation etc)\r\n- Magic & Mystery (Normal guy gets dragged into a magician world by force)\r\n- Character Development (Hey its 4 seasons of this)\r\n- Love & Harem (Lots of it, on a daily basis)\r\nThose are the ones I remember. Anyway this anime is one of my favorites. Because of the sheer volume of episodes ranging through four seasons, the series is greatly developed and so is the story. The story is okay I guess, there are lot of shitty concepts like \"Gandalf\". Really author, youcouldn't come up with a better name so you snatched Gandalf from LOTR? Why? How does it even relate to this anime? The guy fights with a sword and doesn't yell \"You shall not pass\" anywhere. But anyway.\\n\\n\r\nIMO the anime excels because of the sheer harem and love story development. The action is good as well, but not to the degree that I'd say its awesome. But the love & drama part? Its non-sense times ten with a scent of jealousy and lots of bdsm.\\n\\n\r\nLouise is loud, dumb, proud and very very jealous. She tries to shackle and bind Saito in anyway possible. In every episode there is an angry scene of some kind where Saito is being beaten for the \"Ero Inu\" that he is and yelled upon. I'm sure he is sadomasochistic, otherwise there wouldn't be 4 seasons of this. Though as the anime matures more and more, so does the beating part of it as well. And because its a harem, with each season Saito's harem gets bigger and bigger but he never stops loving Louise and that's how the anime ends. IMO, this is a BDSM marriage mixed with vanilla standards. Idk if that makes sense, probably not.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime. It will make you laugh to tears, over and over.\\n\r\nBut you will also bond with it and hook on it. Despite Louise being a time-bomb and Saito being a sadomasochistic pervert, you will like both of them. And if you don't, well its just not your cup of tea.\\n",

Yet , that potential was replace with flaws . Even with flaws , i will say that Zero no Tsukaima did make me interest in its series . Hope the other is better .\r\nStory:8\r\nThe story tells us about a girl that was bad at using magic who is the main heroine , Louise . She then tried to summon a sacred , beautiful and strong familiar which she obviously fail lol . What shesummon was an ordinary human who was the main protagonist , Saito . The story plot was fine . Nothing out of the ordinary .\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nThe arts and animation were fine . There are some beautiful sceneries . Some of the facial expression of the characters seem a bit off . Either way , it was fine but it does have a flaw .\\n\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nThe voice actor and actress here was good . Nothing that make me hate it or anything . Don't know why but the voice actress for Louise seems a bit like Shana from Shakugan no Shana . I could be wrong though . The OP and ED was nice . I like the ED better . It was relaxing .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\r\nSome character does have a background and some didn't . Some of the characters here was like a deja vu to me . Like Louise . She was like the combination of Shana personality and voice from Shakugan no Shana with Aisaka Taiga looks from Toradora! . Another example would be Waldo a.k.a the bad guy (His name was freakin long....I'm not joking....Viscount Jean Jacques francis de Waldo....Seriously ??? -_-) . This guy remind me the skeleton dude from Shakugan no Shana (again...Don't know why it remind me to this anime) . There really wasn't anything fresh or new on the character plot .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nI enjoy this anime just fine . Although it seems like it was rushing or something . The fighting scenes here were plain . Not enough epic or just wow factor . The comedy were funny . The romance here are okay i guess . Well , it's better than Twillight i guess .\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nI can say i'm not that dissapointed on Zero no Tsukaima because it does have another seasons of it . So , the other could be better . What i can say is that if you want to watch an anime where magic , comedy and romance exist with some short episodes , this one is for you .",

            "content": "The Beauty of This Anime\r\nLet me just start from the top... hopefully all these emotions and thoughts racing in my mind will still be there by the time I'm done writing this but. I had not expected much from this show. This, what almost felt to be half-assed show with nothing in it. The only saving grace (that got me hooked) was the ecchi and the early on romance. That is when I had taken this anime a simple and cutesy one, that is what I had entailed for and I had accepted that. Of course... that's when I first started. Looking back now thatI have finished it, this show had absolutely been one of my favorites. How the jokeful beginning, although what back then I had thought to be (when i say beginning i literally mean the first episode) god awful had only contributed to the over all beauty of this anime. This is one of the few animes that I felt had wrapped up very nicely in the end. There was no\"wait, can't there be an episode where they do this?\" Everything had been fulfilled in this anime. The serious moments had only been made better as the jokeful ones made you realize all their hardships and good times together. Making the serious scenes (sigh sorry no specifics) a lot better. To be honest, I'm glad there were this many episodes, around 50. Because with this, you can almost feel the full impact of the entire anime. The love between Saito and Louise, their moments together, how they grew to be fond of each other and literally couldn't live without each other. You could feel the steady tension, the rising emotions and feelings. It had felt like you WERE saito, as each episode (throughout the entire series) had shown you a little bit of their lives. Each and every part, their fights, when they didn't like each other, when they missed each other, when they loved each other, and everything. This had all contributed to the overall feel of the anime, leaving you with this almost heart ache when the serious moments do come. As I'd like to point out clearly, you could feel the steadiness of the anime, like as if it never skipped from one episode to the next. You don't see them liking each other out of the blue for no reason, you reason with yourself how they got to like each other and it makes sense. It's not a surprise when you see them admit and say \"i love you\" because you could feel the steadiness and pacing. After finishing this anime.... I do believe I must call it a flower anime, or some corny stuff like that. An anime that, honestly, in the beginning you don't even know why you're still watching it. It seems to be kind of stupid. However, when you finally finish it, or the more you progress into it, the more you realize that every past action is simply meant to bring about the beauty in the next. It's a snowball effect, and that's why at the end you're left with a big giant freakin snowball in your heart and you are left in a room alone in the dark, where you're left to realize you just finished a beautiful heart-felt anime. (or maybe thats just me). Here's how I recommend this anime, it will only be beautiful and amazing if you watch this from start to finish. Every screentime ever scene every moment and every everything had feelings and emotions that would later bloom. If you are not going to watch this anime from start to finish. Don't, cus otherwise if you don't, it is the shittiest anime ever. However, from start to finish, at the end of the day, I could not help but add this as one of my favorites. (also, i had added this to an overall of 10 because, the story and character interactions i simply could not help but feel that this anime is worthy of a 10. Also, this is an overall review of the whole anime. I hope this will still help you in beginning a journey of beautiful wonders, just have the time to do so though. By the way, don't stop, it gets better ;)) \\n\\n\r\nP.S:\\n\r\nSo that I'm not called a cheater or whatevs, this is also my review for the last season of this show. However, after re-reading that review I had felt it more potent to place into this review as to hopefully get more curious people to watch this slow but amazing show. Thank you! (sorry for my bad reviews by the way, I had recently started and I usually write these right after I finish the anime, while the thoughts and feelings are still flowing. However this USUALLY leaves me with a biased opinion. However, seeing how there is not much criticism I will be fair and write down what I had thought to be some bad things about the anime.)\\n\\n\r\nThe Downfalls, of This Beautiful Anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I wish I could say I loved this with all my heart, and trust me I do, I must try not to be biased and point out some flaws in this anime. As I had said before, this anime is very slow and almost makes you feel stupid for deciding to watch it. However, please find the joy in the echhi and the early on romance and you will feel bound to watch more, which is only making it better. This anime is more for the patient and the determined people who have a shit ton of time on their hand. Which leads me to another flaw. I had watched this anime in quick succession as I had decided to watch a long anime having too much time on my hands. This had left the snowball effect to be more effective since it had kept on rolling, if you do not have enough time on your hands, although I do not know if this anime will still be enjoyable. Be wary. Speaking of the early on romance, that is all its good for. The early on romance in the show (as i like to think of it, borderline ecchi but not quite), had saved the anime and hooked you into watching more. However, be wary, when the serious stuff happens and later you wish they would get along. It could quite possibly get on your nerves quite a bit. Also, somehow, I have no idea how, but that corny ass beginning had actually become a later charm of this anime. Corny being the whole magic school and the over dramatized everything. I'm not too big of a fan of magic when it comes to wands, especially when you use terms as \"line magician.\" However, later in the anime as they developed the plot it turned out to be quite a charm of this show. \\n\\n\r\nUGH!\\n\r\nYou have no idea how painful that was seeing how I love this show. I'm sorry, but please let me wrap this up on a good note XD.\\n\\n\r\nLast Few Bits and Pieces\\n\\n\r\nThe story had dug deep into my soul almost. Although that is a little dramatic, how the anime had made a place within my heart by showing all the characters being fond over each other. Also how they grow on each other, I couldn't help but enjoy it and give them both a 10. To be fair I had wished to give the art a 9 but I had felt that would be too biased. Reason for this is that the kiss scenes, omg the kiss scenes, is what almost had been a major charm of this anime. On the art for that they had did amazing, however refraining from biased opinion I'll leave it at an 8. This being that the art did fall off slightly enough to bother me quite a bit. However I did enjoy the art very much of this show. The sound, at first, was horrible. But of course, they had saved the better for the later as later in the show it gets very nice and in fact you want to hear more. The corny playful music played in the beginning when everything was jokeful, being replayed when everything gets serious and tense. Almost like as if to you remind you of those good times, it is all very sad and I could not help but give a 9. okay then, that concludes this review, sorry for the long one but I had felt I needed to get everything out, enjoy! ^",

I know i shouldn't be expecting anything too great, but honestly, this could have been really cool. If it incorporated a dramatic or more intense serious mood, it may have been really good.\r\n What I DID like about it was the fact that he can use any earth weapon, especially the Zero (history buff). well, its decent for being a harem, ecchi, comedy anime, but it could have had a better story. If it took itself a tad more seriously like Chivalry ofa Failed Knight did (which was a pleasant surprise), it would be a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a 5/10 for me, not that great.

I can respect you if you liked it but I personally want to end its existence.\r\nSo... Dear Zero no Tsukaima, please stop existing.\r\nStory - \r\nI'll be honest, the idea of a modern guy being taken to a fantasy world of magic is a good idea. However, its done by nearly everyone in some way. For example, X person comes in and makes Y's life more interesting. That is basically what this is however you are at risk of causing a hellof a lot more plot holes this way.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Saito's origin isn't immediately forgotten about and is actually quite integral to the 'plot'. I use ' ' because there are only really a few episodes that actually have relevant information in. The rest of the episodes are just a poor excuse for one-liners, repeated jokes and boobs. Even without these episodes, the plot is actually pretty corny and has no real direction or pacing. I mean..... one of the core characters get introduced 4 episodes before the end and only appears in 2 of them for 5 minutes each.\\n\\n\r\nThis is just one example of how some of the more interesting and core elements of the show are neglected in favor of cheap jokes and a mediocre love triangle with no real importance or comedic value.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound  - \\n\\n\r\nI don't remember anything about the sound because it was so average. On top of that, there was really nothing that I can say about the art besides that it matched the quality of the show overall.\\n\\n\r\nIt may not have been terrible but if you have nothing good to present with it then you can only expect a rating as good as what you're dependent on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\\n\r\nEveryone in this show was so stereotypical of a high-school anime. You got the righteous new guy, the underappreciated girl, the busty bimbo, the big mouth romeo and a few perverts here and there. The show knows that these people are cut and paste and uses that to try to present them in an ironic manor, however, they get caught on a nail halfway through and end up making them look even more standard and plain then they would if they tried to take the whole thing seriously.\\n\\n\r\nEverything from the individual, the relationships and the love triangle are absolutely mediocre and cringe worthy. Just.... poor.....\\n\\n\r\nAs a fairness to this anime though, the VA for Saito in the dub did a pretty good job for his first role. Although that appears to be a matter of debete\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  - \\n\\n\r\nIt didn't happen so I can't say anything about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusions - \\n\\n\r\n4 is the lowest rating I have given as of writing this. It is the lowest rating I can give to a show without claiming that it isn't even a show. While that may seem harsh, my 4 is most other peoples 2's. I have a description of my rating system on my profile but to sum it up in one sentence :\\n\\n\r\n                              I do not like you, I don't think anyone should like you, the fact that I watched you, let alone waste energy writing about you, should be considered a blessing.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what happens when you don't do background research on things before you watch them....",

But worst of all this wretched person is the maingirl, she's meant to be a tsundere. Her straight up abuse of the main character is meant to be funny, because abusive relationships don't need to be stopped if it's a women abusing a man. \\n\\n\r\nTheir are other cute girls of course, girls who like the main, but no it's Louis who gets the boy. This little brat with her inflated ego, and her blood stained whip. \\n\\n\r\nIs their anything else memorable about this anime. Ehhh not really no the world is pretty damn generic, the main character is so generic I can't even remember his name. They have a few interesting ideas here and their but their nothing to write home about. but the worst part is their need to maintain the status quo it doesn't matter what happens we always come back to the status quo and as I said Louis doesn't improve. Does it look like she's improving? Wait a few episodes and she'll be back to her bitchy self. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway the anime is largely pretty forgettable, and it makes me more pissed off then any other anime in existence and I have watched a lot of anime.",

The 2 main character are somewhat common today, but something stands-out in the focus of the story instead of the Male protagonist, Saito, being the main focus it wasthe Female protagonist, Louise, who stands-out more. There chemistry is  fair it's not at all bad and sometimes cute. The Sub character are good some better. Siesta is supposed to be an another love rival of Louise but it doesn't really feel like it. Saito doesn't really care that much of her, there was this one episode where Saito tried to save Siesta but it was overshadowed with how much of a douche bag are the Nobles not focusing on Siesta but more on focusing the Nobles greediness. After that episode where Saito saves Siesta, she was really static just there and from time to time appear to make Louise envy her she was just a plot device where the creators could just put and pull out of the scene. Siesta overall is really not that significant in this series.",

But it was kind of enjoyable at some points I guess? \r\nStory\r\n------\r\nThe story here is just plain and filled with cliches. I mean what? Honestly wasn't surprised with what I was about to watch. The anime was just too predicting. Usually I would rate an anime that is too predicting like a 4 - 6 based on my feelings and how much i enjoyed it. I mean, it's a tsundere anime so what is to be expected eh? \r\n6/10\r\nArt\r\n------\r\nThe art style here is great, i mean thereisn't much to say about it. They didn't use CGI or at least I didn't notice. CGI in my opinion is just not compatible with anime unless it is made fully on CGI like Berserk. Usually they use CGI for huge things or moving things cause I think it is easier to render and easier to put in for the animations.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\n------\\n\r\nI guess the OP is fine? I mean it doesn't really pick my interests. The M/V was good I guess since it didn't really show what was going to happen in the whole entire anime. The soundtrack kinda lacks because at cool moments, It doesn't make you feel 'Wow! The soundtrack is so goddamn epic!' like Attack on Titan or Hero Academia.

The Male MC, Saito, is the normal standard anime kind of guy thats personality is mostly like other typical comedy/romance/drama anime. His pervertness is not high so that is a good thing but it's there. And on episode 11 it is just so fucking predicting.\\n\r\nLouise is your typical tsundere so there isn't much to complain though episode 11 just was too cliche.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nHonestly episode 11 is the only complete fuckup cause i've seen a similar plot like so many times (maybe not that many). But I was able to finish this in 4 - 6 hours. I enjoyed it in my own way I guess. Anime could've been way better but hey, would recommend if you into comedy I guess? Anime is fine as it is then.\\n\r\n6/10",

It was a pretty good thing i decided to watch it because now that i have finished it, i was very content. \r\nObviously, form the cover of the anime, you can tell that magic is involved. Zero no Tsukaima is almost a spin of of Harry Potter except with more depth and with many more things added to it. The anime is very well drawn and animated and the characters movements are very articulate. \r\nOver all the anime iswell drawn, it has an inetresting story that, although a bit simple, does entertain and keeps you wanting to see more.",

The story was like alot of others a boy/girl falls into a magical world were they end up falling inlove but out of all those mediocre animes like that i accually enoyed this one.\\n\r\n ~Characters~\\n\r\n The characters were not amazing but they were cute in the \"I fall inlove very fast\" kind of way and we all know that kind of character ;) The boy was a normal perverted character who accually fell inlove the main girl was a cute girl who denied her feelings untill she thought he dident love her then she admited it. The other characters were kinda pointless they really dident effect the series much but they were funny from time to time and were cute to watch make fun of eachother.\\n\r\n ~Overall~\\n\r\n All in all i would say I enjoyed the series but its not one of my favories because even though i liked the plot i disliked the lack of information and the lack of backround given i dident enjoy that it really got no deeper than a pervert falling inlove with his \"master\" so how would i rate it? Above 5 but only because the plot but less than 8 because it was mediocre at time so I will give it a 7. The only reason i will give it that high is because the plot and the cute romance even though it wasent very deep.\\n\r\n Thank you for reading and i hope you enjoy Zero no Tsukaima!",

Always. One day, as a school project, she is to summon a familiar (Magician's partner/+servants), everyone else summons awesome familiars, while Louise summonsa human, from another realm (our realm), he is just a normal japanese kid (voiced by the same guy who did Yuji in shakugan no shana :OH SNAP) but he is forced to be her servant. It's pretty hilarious. After the first goof-off episodes, things get serious. People are put in danger, we discover family problems with some characters, so on and so forth. It's a very good series. It's kind of like a Shakugan no Shana, but 5x's less serious. Also, tagging it as \"Adventure\" fits PERFECTLY.\\n\\n\r\nI hope I was helpful, if I wasn't...sorry XD\\n\\n\r\nWish you the best on your Anime Quest\\n\r\n-Drumming1997",

            "content": "I must say I rather liked it. For something that is apart of one of my favorite genres in anime, I must say I really approve of this anime. \r\nDo not let the synophsis fool you. Yes I at first didn't think it was all that interesting but when I started to watch it (because of my irisistable urge of wizardy.. Curse you Harry Potter!) I became slightly interested, and by the second episode I was more interested in it.\r\nI haven't read the manga yet, I plan to but I cannot at this time give you the difference between the stories. I can tell youis that it was slow at first but was still building. Which is good. Louise and Saito's like for each other is building.. and if you know that some anime just rush into the romance, this does not.. even though it is a short series consisting of only 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThis--if anything--is more like a prologue to the story itself. I must say the story has captured my interest enough to where I want to watch the sequel. This anime has the potential to be one of the best. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was very good as well, a bit girlish, but very good none the less. I enjoyed the scenary, the effects of the magic, etc. The characters expressions where very well captured. I don't have much to say for the art other than that I really liked it more so than most animes. \\n\\n\r\nAnd here is where it defaults. The sound. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending were good, though I sometimes skipped the ending song because I didn't enjoy listening to it all that much. It was good, but could have been better. The opening was better suited to the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors for english.. Well, I must say it was a miracle that it wasn't bad to the point where I wanted to choke FUNimation. In other words it is watchable, but do expect to become annoyed. Some of the voice cast didn't seem to fit the role, like Saito, but some fitted nicely. And this is saying much seeing as FUNimation always seems to have a way to mess up the casting. So yes it was nicely done. A fair six I say. \\n\\n\r\nHey, just because I said it was watchable and the opening and ending were good doesn't mean I am going to give it a higher rating. Six is fair enough considering I watched the whole thing in english. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters now. I am finally glad to say that I haven't seen any Mary-sue qualities yet. Louise and Saito's relationship is at a slow building process, even if the anime--as I said--is short. Some of the other characters as well where enjoyable as well.. Though I must say that they really didn't need to give one so much sex appeal and have that needy tone, one with such pride.. 'blah'.. They were still good and helped the story progress.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this was great. I really enjoyed the humor, story, character, sound could have been better, the science behind it.. Almost everything. I would say if you like Harry Potter or just into the whole magic world, this is a fun watch.. but do expect to become slightly annoyed somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a very good anime. Some minor flaws now and again, but it was a nice prologue to the rest of the series.",

They were adorable. The only thing that bothered me while watching this anime was how many annoying side characters there were, and how many typical girls fell for the main male protagonist. It is a harem anime, so I guess that is tobe expected but it was way to predictable and annoying. Otherwise, the action and everything else was well written.",

The truth is that I entered this series just for some laughs, those sexual mishap moments, and to be taken away and feel like I was in the story, what I got was all that but I discovered this story was given a plot as well,there were those moments where lose strings are suddenly pulled together, those shocking moments of trechary, and then those moments that make you fall over laughing due to the pure comedy of the situation.

            "content": "What's the anime about:\r\nThere is a world where there are two kinds of people magic users Aristocrats) and non magic users (Pleibeians) The anime sets play in a magic school for the aristocrats. In that school there is a girl who gets called 'Zero' because of her 0 success rate on spells. Anyway the second years which she is too has to summon a kind of companion, which is called 'familiar'. She summons the worst possible she thinks, a human. The human has to take care of the mage and they will have fun and 'romantic' stuff.\r\nWhat can I expect:\r\nBasically you could expect a greatbasic story and a bad progressive work.\\n\\n\r\nwe can say that events taking place are done OK, but lacking in one specific thing: Which is reappearance of events. For example: you get a world saving ring and must wear it at all times and the next episodes it gets ignored, Because that specific thing gets done a lot and I hated that a lot.\\n\\n\r\nAlso you can expect a lot of fan service and overdone situations.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is basically an introducement to the surrounding theme, which is magic and of course fantasy, and a small explainment of characters. The story is OK, but I hoped some more. The pros are in the work of knowledge, they make it so we know the same amount of info as the characters in the anime. That's done well and I got more interested in the anime. Tough the cons is really the fan-serviced environment of the anime, it's just annoying sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nArt&Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are even better then animes that come out these days, and that in 2006, Really good from them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is less detailed, but fine, and the sound is amazing. Nothing to complain.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters feel really kind of off, the main characters are done good, but one episode characters just lack some stuff. Besides that every character has fan service and are predictable. I feel that the character design lacked, but was okay.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is so much fun to watch I laughed a lot and felt with the characters when something bad happened. From random events to laughable people the comedy part was done really good, But the romance lacked, a lot! There wasn't really romance in this anime just romantic ecchi. If you are here for the romance I wouldn't recommend it. Besides the romance part the ecchi is good and feels attractive I guess. The action in this anime is bad just horrible. But there isn't too much in it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nA hilarious anime with a lot of fan service and great art&sound.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for echhi and comedy lovers.\\n",

Even during the battle with Waldo, Saito has his will to protect Louise so he gets stronger and defeat Waldo.\r\nYou know I actually could not believe that I really hate most tsunderes. Just like Kaname Chidori from FMP & Ayano Kannagi from KnS. Louise is really a loud-mouth, likes to talk bad about people, demanding, rude, arrogant and selfish. Louise always wants to have her way all the way, otherwise she will bash people up even like Saito. I do really feelbad about Saito after all the treatment that Louise bestowed upon him.\\n\\n\r\nLouise in the battle with Waldo, she is a damsel in distress waiting for Saito to save her. Oh no, not another cliche with damsel in distress. Why is it that most action animes I see feature damsel in distress? How can there be a unique anime without damsel in distress? I also feel that it is ok for Saito to make friends with the girls but as long as he is not obsessed with them but it is normal for a guy to like a girl anyway. \\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, this anime is not so engaging (4/10). By the way, the art and sound is just nice.",

            "content": "This review is for all 4 seasons of Zero no tsukaima, as in my opinion is not much of a difference between them.\r\nStory - \r\nThe story is well done, although it is nothing super complex and it's not the main focus of the show anyway. It's easy to follow, consistent and yet not totally plain.\r\nArt, Sound, Design - \r\nNothing special to say here, you can see the graphical style in trailers or pictures, and the animation in normal scenes as well as in fights is well done.\r\nOverall - \r\nThe main aspect of the show is the two main characters trying to get along, as oneof them is an aristocrate in a world of magic, while the other one is her familiar, brought to her from the \"normal\" world. So a master-slave relationship (not in a perverted manner) between two people of completely different backgrounds, and furthermore even being from two different worlds.\\n\\n\r\nOver the 49 episodes from all 4 seasons they build up quite the cute romance, with many romantic, tragic and funny dialogues / scenes between them. What I didn't like was that both characters are extremely dense when it comes to talking about their feelings, and her being enormously jealous (while he gives her every right to be so in the beginning). That results in nearly no progress in their relationship during the second and third season, as basically every couple scene is followed by a fight again. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you solely watch it for the romance, you might want to skip at least parts of the episodes of seasons 2 and 3 as it will possibly feel dragged out, the main progress happens in seasons 1 and 4. It is still worth it in my opinion, the ending was awesome and in between you might even be forced to shed a tear or two (depending on how sensible you are of course ;) ).\\n\\n\r\nSo in short, the reason for my 8/10 is that it becomes a bit repetitive in the middle, with both characters constantly going back and forth with arguing and loving. But that's the only thing I have to criticise about it.",

            "content": "I must admit, I'm thoroughly surprised at how good this was.\r\nZero no Tsukaima! An anime about magic & alternate universes. The anime is about a boy named Saito who is magically teleported to another universe where things aren't what he's accustomed to. He later finds out that he's been transported to a world called \"Halkeginia\" and that he's become a \"familiar.\" Really, the story isn't too special or anything, but given the year this anime was released, I'd say they did a great job at making a \"unique\" anime for the time.  However, just because this anime is old, doesn't mean that it doesn'tfollow the same types of cliches that we have seen many times before. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are both quite good too! Almost has a similar look to Toradora! in some ways. The OP is pretty catchy, too. As well as the entire OST!\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, let me just say this right off the bat: if you don't like the tsundere type, please don't even watch this. I've read too many reviews about the main girl character and how she's so obnoxious or whatnot. But aside from that, the characters in general, are pretty good. I really should mention that there are definitely some generic characters here, some that kinda just have absolutely no \"character\" to them at all: IE, most, if not all the villains and their motives are just really plain. But since they're not entirely the focus of the plot here, I'd say the main characters really make up for that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I have to say, I'm impressed. I really had no expectations in the beginning, and I really expected this anime to be just \"alright.\" Each episode really pulls you in wanting more from the next. And while there *really* isn't anything different about this anime, I personally had a fun time watching it. I reccomend you give this anime a watch only if you don't mind some bland characters along the way. Trust me, it's pretty fun.\\n\\n",

Boy was I wrong.\r\nI was never a big fan of the tsundere-type characters, though it hasn't ruined a show for me, at least not until this series. Louise is one of the worst main characters that I've seen. Her male counterpart is bound to her, so she literally treats him like an abused dog. I'd be fine with this series if the characters matured over time, but the lack of \"dere\" from Louise justmakes her seem like a spoiled bully all throughout. For me, a perfect example of tsundere done right, would have to be Taiga in Toradora! She's all \"tsun\" at the beginning but grows softer/kinder as the series progresses, unlike Louise in this series.\\n\\n\r\nSaito is no better. He saves her time and time again, but the dude lacks a spine when it comes to her. He allows her to beat him, he flirts with other girls, even though he knows that it will result in further beatings. Then he comes back to her with hearts in his eyes because he really cares for her. Other women are practically throwing themselves at him, yet he's head-over-heels in love with the bully that has trust issues.\\n\\n\r\nWriting this out, it sounds more like a love story between a sadist and a masochist, which isn't for me. I just don't understand this sort of relationship.",

            "content": "Ok so this part of the review is going to be up till the part of Season 2 ep 12 and boy do I have alot of mixed feelings about this show...\r\nThe story to this show I thought was interesting to start off, even though it feels like it's meant for an audience range of 10 year old's I still decided to give it a watch.. Let me just express my feelings towards the female main character. Personally I despise her.. She's so aggressive to a point where it's not even funny, it's like watching one of the most jealous and unstable little slave owningbrats in the world. The character has it's ups sometimes don't get me wrong.. But for like 87% of it, it's just straight up awful.. \\n\\n\r\nArt seems good to me along with sound.. I'm pretty much already explained what I think about the characters but they all seem fine to me apart from Louise. Enjoyment so far is a good 5-6/10.. \\n\\n\r\nI'll return after watching season 3 ;D\\n\\n\r\nSo after watching season 3, I still stand on what I've said about what happened in season 2. Louise is still being a jealous and unstable bitch along with being unstable about her \"love\" for saito and it's still annoying.. Although it's been turned down quite a bit it feels like it's not even real? If you get what I mean.. It feels like at some points it's not realistic to a point where why would saito even stay? Constantly getting beaten and whip for doing things that he has no control over for example: Spoiler I guess? 'When Tabitha's dragon came into human form and appeared naked in front of everyone and louise got pissed and beat him because he saw her..' It's so stupid how jealous she gets and honestly is starting to piss me off..\\n\\n\r\nAs for the others things like art, sound, characters, enjoyment it's pretty much the same as I said before..\\n\\n\r\nOnto season 4!\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the final season to the series I can say I was kinda of turned back around on my previous comments abit considering it was all dialed down a bunch. The ending was iffy and I understand that it went that way but it could of possibly gone a better way I guess? Season 4 Louise turned down the aggressive behavior along with the constant abuse towards the main character and I think it changed my opinion on her. The art for the series seemed to be decent and I'm definitely attracted more of these types of animes than any other and definitely did enjoy the series as a whole. The whole series was a nut case for me and the characters really impacted the way how I felt but I'm glad I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to someone? Possibly... if you're looking for a show that would be most relatable to 13 and so year olds where they don't really give a crap about realism and how the real world works.. then yes give it a go..",

            "content": "I have a friend that really enjoys shows that have the tags ecchi, harem, and school in it. And at one point, I did as well. One day a few years ago, he recommended a show called \"Familiar of Zero\" because he can't read Japanese for shit. I never got around to it, because I used crunchyroll mobile which didn't have the first season of this show. So a few years pass and I decide to watch this show because I literally do nothing else with my life. So I watch this show, and I don't think I've checked my phone more in one sitting.The show wasn't necessarily bad, it just was so \"meh\" that I couldn't help but be bored. It wasn't bad enough for me to have fun laughing at it, nor was it amazing enough to keep me invested throughout the entire series. I have heard from my friend that this show is \"really funny\" and from other sources that it's a \"comedic masterpiece\" or so I've heard. I laughed like 1...2? I think I laughed like about 1 1/2 times if you lower my standards for comedy as low as the girls in Kirito's harem would go for the Kiri-dick. I watched this while talking with my friends in a discord chat and my friend was asking if it was funny or not. I replied with a question. A simple question. \"Is this show supposed to be a comedy?\" There were little to no jokes to it, I don't know why comedy is a tag. I think that's enough bashing on the comedy, I'll move on to a part I actually did like somewhat, maybe, not really, I'm grabbing for anything that doesn't make me look like an asshole for not liking this show. The characters in this show are...decent at best. I've heard Louise is a great tsundere, but I can't find myself interested in her. Maybe she gets better in the later 3 seasons this show somehow got, but that's not what I'm here to review. She comes off as this flat(not the way you're thinking) tsundere that's about as deep as the characters in PSO2 the Animation. She acts like a typical tsundere in one scene, then she shows some dere. Then, she's back to the tsundere. The switch between \"tsun\" and \"dere\" isn't bad, it just is \"meh.\" I don't really care about her as a character until far too late into the anime. It's so far into the anime, I'm not sure how weekly watchers even made it through episode 5. Louise isn't the only problem. Saito is as flat as Louise's chest. We don't learn much about him at all. Was  he a shut in? We don't know. Was he a functioning member of society? Pfft. Why're you asking me? We just learn that he was walking on the street, and then he runs into a portal thing that no one else can see. Then he's in a world with wizards. That's the extent of all I remember, so if anything more happens, then this show couldn't keep me invested in the plot long enough to even pay attention to the details. Backing off of Saito, we can delve into the side \"characters.\" I wouldn't call them \"characters,\" I'd call them \"drawings will voices that move in a fancy way.\" I can't say much about them. We have a deadpan, a stick with balloons for tits(every highschool dxd girl except Koneko), and then we have conceited guy that does nothing.  They don't get enough screen time or dialogue for me to feel anything towards them as characters, much less the people they're supposed to simulate. That's all I can comment on the characters in this show. Now moving onto the plot. The plot is pretty much summed up to \"he was summoned into a different world, and now he wants to go back.\" Then it's hinted that other people were also summoned into this world. It goes nowhere with this for the rest of the series except when the ending hits, and it's kind of satisfying? Then the series pulled an Attack on Titan before it even came out. It shoehorned in some politics to keep the show running so maybe they can keep the viewer invested. I really hope shows drop this shit, because it just prolongs the show and keeps the viewer from watching the interesting aspects they came to watch. Overall, I didn't really enjoy this show(because it wasn't obvious enough). I don't particularly recommend this show to anyone, but if you're bored and want some half assed romance for an entire season to finally(maybe) get into the good parts, be my guest. I originally gave this show a 7, but I think I'll move it down to a 6 upon further inspection.",

            "content": "[Spoilers ahead and a bit of a rant]\r\nSo look, this anime isn't all that good, nor is it laughably bad. It's a mid tier show with it's ups and downs. The pacing seems very off at points. This anime is literally \" toradora the isekai\" and it's okay i guess. It's very hard to relate to any of the characters since the main guy's thing is that he is the slave (familiar) to a jackass, but it's cool though since she's cute.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is nothing special nor is it original. It's a very basic isekai story. The one thing that does surprise me is howthe harem is introduced. It's not like the mc is just loved by every girl because he's a bland ass nigga, but he actually talks to them and helps them out. Sometimes going to extreme lengths to do so. \\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\r\nnothing special. Art isn't the best but it isn't horrible. The sound is very basic and what you'd kind of expect from this show, but it is a little wonkey at times.\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nIt's a worse version of Taiga, but i must say, the voice actress is very good at what she does. \\n\r\nBefore i get any further i must say it's made by the same company who produced Toradora, but that doesn't excuse some of the shots being almost complete rip offs of those in Toradora.\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt's something mindless that you watch to pass the time. If you are very serious about your anime, and like the logistics and shit, don't watch this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlright so episode 11 did kind of upset me. So this wannabe Twisted Fate pops up like \"What's good wifey? Heard this 15 year old is your lover...Naaaah lemme just change that right quick\"\\n\r\nand shes like \"aight cool.\"\\n\r\nlike this girl is a basic ass thot my guy. it took her about 1 episode to jump ship (a little pun you'll get if you watch the show) from one guy to another. My G the MC just said \"aye hoe be quiet for a second\"\\n\r\nthen this not even able to wear a training bra ass hoe is like \"ima hop on this fourty year old's dick then\" You feel me???\\n\r\nshits got me mad that the writer just made this tsundere into a little hoe. It's obvious that the two MC's have feelings for eachother, but nah let's just ride this shit out for two more episodes. Why does my guy even put up with this hoe? He's got mad pussy my guy.

The problem is that that is not the only problem. \r\nStory (5) - Characters (4) \r\nA school of magic on an other world holds so much potential, like, really, much potential that is not well explored. They could develop and explore that fantasy world more, but that was replaced with exploringthe relationship between Saito and Louise. \\n\r\nShe is abusive, one of the most Tsundere characters that I saw in my life.\\n\r\nAnd Saito just thinks with the \"other head\" if you know what I mean.\\n\r\nThey are not good characters but I shipp them with their imperfections.\\n\r\nPeople say \"oh, poor Saito\", but I say \"well, he is not a saint, she isn`t either, they are good for eachother\" \\n\r\nI like characters that are imperfect, but they weren`t well developed.\\n\r\nThe whole anime gave me a impression of surface. \\n\r\nThe villains were poor also...

            "content": "The Familiar of Zero is required viewing, not because it's particularly great, but because it will allow viewers to accurately gauge other anime's quality. All the tricks (the tsundere girl, the ordinary protagonist, the Casanova second guy, etc.) are all in their basic form here. That's hardly this show's fault for being made in 2006.  I believe that a lot of shows looked that this series and imitated its elements without ever understanding WHY those elements were in the show to begin with. That the characters needed a reason to behave the way they behaved in a situation. \r\nThe show's premise revolves around aKerr black hole of interactions between Louise and Saito (Her familiar). Unfortunately, it is impossible for me to compress my patience into 36 bytes or less because neither character warrants it all that much. Do I understand them? Yes? Do I particularly care? Not as much as I should as often as I should. There were moments where I was straight-up 'Who Cares', and then there were moments I felt like their happiness was straight of 'D'Awwww.'  But viewing it as a 20 year old guy in 2016, maybe I'm out of the age-range needed to fully appreciate this show.\\n\\n\r\nOne almost wants to shake Louise, and go 'Your partner is a HUMAN. A HUMAN. WITH INDEPENDENT THOUGHT!\" And I can't believe I'm saying this, but Saito really needed a catchphase, something along lines of 'CONTEXT! PLEASE!' everytime something happened that he didn't understand (Which is quite often.)\\n\\n\r\nSaito also couldn't figure out that biting-the-hand humor with Louise, someone's who short on humor, is not exactly a good idea to get into her good graces. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILER FOR THE LAST EPISODE: When Saito gets an old WWII fighter plane, and it looks like he's going to leave, at one point, Louise manages to jump into the cockpit with him. I would have loved for the season to end with them actually getting through the solar eclipse and ending up on Earth. Hey, we spent the first season with Saito being a fish-out-of-water. Now, let's make Louise hold serve.",

The anime has its funny parts and good n romantic parts but there is parts where i'm just meh.. \r\nThe Season it not that bad, Its been quite thestrange and \"childish\" anime.(tbh) might Love this if i where somewhat 14 or something.. But there is a few thing i love, is this Weird humor, WW2 Weapons in a Harry potter world, Louise and saito is personally a quite an interesting, cute romans and twisted couple n some more. But i can\u2019t be to critical and expect too much from a anime made in 2006.\\n\\n\r\nQuick review:\\n\r\nAnimation/Art- Rather Good tbh for a 06 and cause i have just plain worse 06 animation\u2026but I\u2019m surprised that is this nice. U can see the animation in faces they made it quite well, as what i think personally. Landscape background n the details is beautiful, and quite colourful. 8.4/10\\n\r\nCharacter- I mean, they are Twisted in a Harry Potter lookalike world, Somewhat stupid, childish (ish) and so on. All the classic for a characterbase, and sense i have no internet at the time and have all 4 season downloaded. (WHY NOT)I\u2019m bored and use my phone with internet to write this down. But they all are interesting characters and to me they are nothing out the ordinary, But as for the enemies, they where just way too obvious to detect\u2026 not so fun.. 6.5/10\\n\r\nMusic- Maybe would Love it! If i where somewhere around 12-14 a japanese child, (okey was to much) No, Music have its sweet touch. and rated i would be a 5.7/10, cause why? cause it feel just to childish..\\n\r\nStory- Well can\u2019t really say much, As from what i have heard from the manga people, it could have been better. But don\u2019t wanna say to much sense i have 3 seasons more to go. But for me its been simply great right now from just this one season and do wanna see more of it, Would rate it a7.4/10 \\n\r\nEnjoyment n Overall- Had its downsides but overally i enjoyed it. One thing for sure it always had funny scenes where i just couldn\u2019t stop laughing. As for the romantic, is succeeded with few cute scenes the was just brilliant. Didn't felt so much emotions except with a backstory at episode 8, For enjoyment with the anime i would say a 8.3/10\\n\\n\r\nBut as for a Overall a 7.5/10 rate\\n\r\nThanks for reading",

            "content": "First anime review! I kind of rush typed this in 10 minutes so excuse me for the typos/grammar errors or lines that don't make sense.\r\nSo I won't use the specifics of the Anime Rating System of myanimelist to write this review. Instead, I'll focus on a couple of categories (tl,dr: Just watch the anime it's pretty damn great.)\r\nSetting- 9.8\r\nI couldn't ask for a better setting. A hero from another world is summoned and has to protect his sadist master. This show is literally the sadist version of Dog Days (http://myanimelist.net/anime/10155/Dog_Days). The type of beauty and complexity in a vast and new environment really sets Zerono Tsukaima apart from other anime, and really stands out in the \"Another World\" genre as well. Though not much is focused specifically on the setting, it creates a great bridge for both Zero no Tsukaima's plot and character development.\\n\r\nI really think this deserves a 10, but because the setting had little to do with the plot, and the fact that I enjoy it for personal reasons made me bring down the score by fractions of a point.\\n\\n\r\nPlot- 7.5\\n\r\nEhh... Why not? The plot is fairly good if not great, but there are minor flaws. I think this just might be personal opinion, but I really don't enjoy shows to their maximum potential when \"filler stories\" are more evident than the overall plot. Don't get me wrong, Zero no Tsukaima implements the smaller stories taking place between episodes  into the main almost perfectly, but the filler itself takes interest away from the story which then would be both be harder to find and not as significant in the  13 episode run.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development- 8.25\\n\r\nThe character development in Zero no Tsukaima is phenomenal. Even with a tsundere like Louise, I still feel like they developed her potential as a sadist, dependent character. Saito on the other hand, is partly meant to contradict Louise, being the more \"outgoing\" and \"cheerful\" character. I really enjoy watching the interactions between these two characters specifically, and it makes me laugh at times, but sometimes I feel the lack of personification with the characters, like when they obviously do something stupid. The two character's interactions with one another leads to conflicts that just make you stare intently at the screen.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound- 7.5\\n\r\nFor a 2006 anime, watching this in 720p and 1080p makes it look like it's from the 2010's. Sound quality is fair as well, but the graphics make the anime stand out a lot. Art style isn't as unique as titles you would find today, but they're fairly decent if not good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9.5\\n\r\nThis has been one of the most enjoyable shows in a long time for me, since I've already finished all the other anime on my \"anime to watch\" list. The only reason I'm not giving this a 10/10 is because of the lack of \"plot efficiency\" in the show and lack of planning. The show feels very rough with the transitions, but I'll still give it a high score for its potential.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8.25\\n\r\nGreat show. Go watch it if you haven't already\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

It is a source of great embarrassment to her, and she is constantly teased by her fellow students with the nickname 'Zero'. Out of rage one evening, she promises that when she summons her familiar, a magical companion to be with her till death, it will be the most incredible and fantastic familiar ever seen.\r\nAt the summoning ceremony, she is regarded by all with mocking eyes; and when her familiar turns out to be a human, the others,though disappointed it's not more ridiculous, are not impressed. He doesn't even speak their language (funny fact, their language is french, as the writings show through the 4 seasons).\\n\r\nHiraga Saito doesn't know where he is and believes he has been kidnapped when he comes to. However, he slowly learns that he has been taken to another world, and that here, he has an obligation to a young girl by the name of Louise.\\n\r\nThis show tells the story of Louise's blossoming as a magician, and the incredible story of the familiar from another world. They live together through countless adventures that take them through three different countries of Louise's world. They get entangled with royals, they fight battles and wars, they learn secrets that connect their two worlds. And together they live a classic tsundere romance, both very attracted to the other (by destiny if by nothing else) and yet never being able to just come out and tell the other how it is.\\n\r\nZero no Tsukaima is a fantastic blend of slice of Life elements, with Saito being an object of attention for everyone in the school at first, and slowly becoming known throughout the kingdom as a great soldier, and more action and fantasy aspects, with the world politics that are slowly introduced and developed, as well as the large wars that Saito and Louise find themselves caught in.\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Zero no Tsukaima. It kept me hooked through all 4 seasons, and I really felt for the characters from beginning to end.",

She was such a great character and had the most character development. \r\nZero no Tsukaima is the first anime that left me questioning whether I enjoyed the ride or not... In my opinion, I feel like the progression of the story and the way the characters are conflict in so many ways. It was overall slow and Louise, the main female character, despite  having lovely development, lacked story. In most episodes, she was just there and used when needed, she had a few episodeswhere she was used for comedy relief, well she was mostly used for comedy relief. She did, however have romance plots, but even those lasted over two episodes before being pushed to the side by another female character that needed attention. We all know romantic series have always been a tricky, unforgiving genre; you make one mistake and the story slowly begins to crumble, I believe this is one of them. \\n\\n\r\nZero o Tsukaima was, is supposed to be a Romance/Fantasy/Sci-Fi anime and where it succeed I Fantasy and Sci-Fi, it failed in romance. Sure all the female characters had their crushes and such, but nothing really got to me. I believe I read somewhere, \" Zero no Tsukaima should be an enjoyable action anime based in a majestically magical world, sadly it executes the premise horrendously, clinging to repetitive comedy and a subpar plot. The characters were written poorly; this is evidenced by their shallow nature and monotonous interaction, of which Saito and Louise are the worst offenders.\"\\n\\n\r\nTo make it as blunt as possible, this is one of the few that shouldn't be on the 'To watch' lists. It is an anime that should be watched whenever you're bored or something. I wouldn't necessary say, don't watch it, the Art is amazing, beautiful and the sound/music is just as beautiful. But the plot and growth. Blah.",

            "content": "Before hearing this review, this one refers to the whole series, not just season 1.\r\nThis anime is mostly popular due to the new faces in anime jumping on the most recent series. The plot is basically a boy lost in a foreign world and in a foreign school, full of magic. From there you can pretty much tell what's going to happen, especially since its perfectly set up for an ecchi. But there are also some parts where I really enjoyed the show. The humor was delightful with those \"WTF are you going to do!?\" moments, meshing with some good old fashion ecchi mentality. Plusthe action was fairly good, mostly because of Saito's mediocre magical ability. Also with the fact that the endings were very dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I have to say is that only the first and second season are really any good. The third was pretty bad, and felt rushed, making little to no sense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10, I personally hope that they make a fourth edition to the series because the end of the third season left me out on a limb screaming WTF!?",

This is a harem anime, you have come to the wrong place if you are looking for something else. Harem means tons of girls falling for one guy so its only natural since this isa harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nthis was my favourite anime when i was around 15 and i have re-watch this anime for over 4 times yet i still find it pretty amazing. The last episode on second season made me cry and it is one of the best scene in the anime.\\n\\n\r\ni hope more people will know about this show, this is one of the few harem/ ecchi shows that has a good plot in in. you can't find that many anime where main character get trapped in another world. (especially with swords and magic). this anime is obviously aim at Guys instead of girls, girls will probably won't like this since the amount of fan-service and harem is high. \\n",

I watched all the seasons and read most of the light novels with no problems, but now I cringe at certain moments I rewatch now that older. Despite that I guess I can say this series is another guilty of mine.\r\nStory: 8\r\nSaito is an average boy summoned to this magical world when a magician student nicknamed Louise the Zero attempts to summon a familiar but gets him instead. Saito struggles to adapt this newworld as a slave/pet/familiar to Louise who comes from a royal family be struggles to keep up with everyone else causing her to have low self-esteem, the two eventually fall in love.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story does take place in a high school and seem like most harem ecchi anime (which is is), there's an underlying story in Zero about why Saito was sent to the magical world in the first place and Louise wanting to be a more stronger and respected figure.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThere's nothing special about the art but the show manages to surprise you some of the time from being spectacular to pretty bad though there's too jarring. I love the use of magic and sometimes I hate it, I guess it's a love or hate thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of the characters is similar to moe at it's worst. Outside of the moe thing the character design are well-done and done for obvious fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are pretty catchy, and throughout the show you may be immersed with the background music which manages to keep a magical and upbeat tone in the slice-of-life moments. Some songs come off generic but nothing too bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThe show has a flaw of using cliche type characters from the average perverted japanese male, the tsundere loli who may be a sadist, the womanizer, the busty flirt, the kind Betty for Saito, and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Saito is likable Louise can be downright annoying as she has a habit of whipping Saito and treating him like a down when she's mad and especially when she's jealous without any proper reasoning. It's played for comedy but I always found it cringe worthy as the anime shows these beating are something to be feared. Saito is nothing to shake a ham at but he grows over time and admits his love for Louise very early in the series rather than dicking around (though that doesn't mean he isn't aroused by the other girls in his \"harem\").\\n\\n\r\nSiesta is the character I have the most problem with as her personality changes twice thoughout the series being a normal girl Saito could relate to against sadist Louise, but as Louise calmed down her entire character became more aggressive *cough* i mean slutty as if Saito couldn't handle two docile girls.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThis is a very fun and magical anime that knows how to be a romantic comedy and fantasy at the same time. While sometimes Louise and Saito's relationship becomes tedious and drawn out the stuff in between is very rewarding. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nThis may be just like any other ecchi romantic comedy with lots of fanservice and if you survive  all that you'll be rewarded with a magically fun romantic dramedy, but beware the fan service will alway be there. ALWAYS. DON'T THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE IT. One word: Siesta.\\n",

            "content": "Here's little critique I made a bit into season three after not being able to take holding in my growing frustration, so obvious spoliers (They're very light spoilers which won't necessarily ruin anything)\r\nBit of critique, They seem to make a point of making it a cliche of Louise nearly every episode saying something along the lines of \u201cOh Saito! Why me? Why do you choose me?\u201d It makes it hard to watch at points. Since he\u2019s a teenager it should seem plausible he would act like one instead of instantly obeying her from the begining. And even at this point when he seems to havemuch more freedoms he continues the cliche. \u201cBecause you chose me of course!\u201d I suppose it would help if we knew about his background when he lived in Tokyo, but honestly \u201cI\u2019m not an aristocrat, I\u2019m not worth anything\u201d has been said several times too many within the span of just a few episodes. Thevshow would be much better if he, while still Louise\u2019s famiiar, was able to form some sort of relationship with other characters without being interupted everytime because they feel that Louise has to be in every scene. She\u2019s a bit of an obnoxious character. I understand she is supposed to be a tsundere character, but that doesn\u2019t excuse the fact the only relationshio building is forced between the two charactes. Tabitha seemed to be an interesting character, her alone could make an entire anime series herself from just her background story showed so far.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAlmost each and every character that needed to have it was given a decent background or at the very least some recognizable trait. For the most part none of the characters were entirely obnoxious. Except for Louise, everyone had what screen time was needed. \\n\r\nLouise is a very cliche character, which is fine because it's a good cliche. It's everything else that's bad. Whomever made the series decided they reaaaaally liked Louise and decided to stuff her in nearly every scene, which wouldn't be so bad if every scene with her wasn't the same thing. Either an explosion because Saito was being a perv. A kissy scene with Saito because \"Don't leave me Saito\", or in general something that just doesn't sit right with me.\\n\\n\r\nSaito is interesting and I'll keep his short. Very cliche, boy meets magic girl by summoning, falls in love with girl and says he'll never  betray his feelings for her. And does it every other episode. If it wasn't for Louise getting stuffed in every scene he may have been to actually be able to develop a relationship with at least ONE character. Tnis ruined his character development, as character development is done best with multiple characters at once which can't be done if his master is placed in every nook a cranny of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my final review I though it was average, it definately gave me something to do after watching Toradora, which means it's not a complete failure.",

War is coming and all these situations are thrown at them, like a typical story. The reason it's not and 8, 9, or 10, is because of the Harem and Fan-service. All the girls were getting wet over Saito and left Louise in the dust. I didn't like how they made all the girls have big busts and left Louise with a flat chest so everyone could complain about/make fun of it,Tabithia was flat-chested too - but wasn't bothered because of it. I didn't understand why Louise still loved Saito after all that - even though she treated him like dirt too. \\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was amazing!

Boys and girls are welcome in this series since it is about a boy and a girl. Exposure of scenes to both are equally distributed, so viewers need not be afraid for their characters to be left out\r\nThe girl, studying magic and a bit of a klutz, is to summon for the first time, their familiar, their partner for life. The summoning ended up with a bang, smokes everywhere and here enters the boy. Now the pair is completed, adventures commence, and some love triangles, heartbreaking scenes,and childish misunderstandings where the boy ends up toasted. I should inform, the girl is kind of a tsundere, I believe that's what they call it, a strong spirited female character. So no wonder for a toasted boy.\\n\\n\r\nGirl meets boy. boy meets girl_1, girl meets girl_1, boy meets boy_1?\\n\\n\r\nSince the dominating genre here is romance and a bit for younger viewers, kids, I can forgive boats floating, missing adults where kingdoms go to war and etcetera as long as they be consistent. \\n\\n\r\nI always believed that no matter how overrated the story, good writers finds a way and this anime, if asked to describe, after the telling, the response would be an expectant cliche impression.

            "content": "There\u2019s something about PG-13 \u201cecchi\u201d harem anime that I just don\u2019t understand. And look, I don\u2019t want to be the guy at the porn theatre who can\u2019t comprehend why the repair man never got around to fixing the TV at the lonely housewife\u2019s apartment. I get that harem anime is not trying to be realistic or deep blah blah blah. I just don\u2019t regard the genre very highly, as the primary focus seems to be on cheap laughs and the audience\u2019s boner rather than on good story telling and realistic character development. In my humble opinion, there are other types of media for that\u2026\r\nI alsodon\u2019t have that much experience with the genre; I think the only others I managed to finish have been High School of the Dead and School Days (if you can count that). \\n\\n\r\nAs for ZnT though, it was not as good as it could have been (based on my aforementioned standards) but a lot better than I thought it would be after episode 1\u2026and even the first season (I\u2019ve finished 2/4 seasons so far).\\n\\n\r\nThe premise relies on many clich\u00e9s but is still engaging. \\n\r\nSaito, A boy from Japan, gets summoned to a magical world by a struggling mage student named Louise. Louise makes Saito her pet and the two of them experience many breast- and panty-themed adventures and misadventures together. Beyond the slapstick humor, ecchi and inevitable love triangle drama, is an actual attempt at a plot/story and tsundere-style romance which I think redeemed the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was interesting but the action sequences were definitely PG-13 and there wasn\u2019t the type of \u2018life or death\u2019 urgency that you might have seen in darker anime. Still, they introduce some gripping elements into the adventure and there is occasionally suspense and uncertainty. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of season one, this anime was at odds with itself. It tried to be both a \u201charem\u201d and \u201cromance\u201d anime at the same time which led to an inevitable tradeoff. Unless dating in Japan is completely different than in the US, you simply cannot maintain a corral of horny, slavering anime girls whilst simultaneously trying to pursue a sweet, affectionate long-term relationship with someone special. Lol.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly though, there is something to be said about this conflict. Isn\u2019t this what happens when you become exclusive with someone? You trade breadth for depth. I suppose this could have been explored. Not surprisingly though, this anime chose to circumvent this boner-killing conundrum and instead writes Saito in and out of implausible ecchi situations without any real consequences. At least by season 2, harem aspect becomes (slightly) less dominant in favor of developing a touching romance between two of the characters. The harem shenanigans still acted as a ball and chain on the believability of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nUnexpectedly, the harem element added one positive aspect to the storyline. It upped the ante when it came to expressiveness and physical affection between Saito and his primary love interest. If Saito is going to be stumbling into a voluptuous bosom every other scene then the audience might expect more than that anticlimactic nod, smile and hug between the two mains at the end (btw, I haven\u2019t watched seasons 3&4 so I have no idea what happens at the end of ZnT). \\n\\n\r\nArt: decent but not mesmerizing. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I liked the intros and soundtrack. It was definitely above average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Here\u2019s where we run into more harem-related problems. The whole harem set-up relies on a completely ridiculous constellation of premises and thought-processes-- a bunch of girls liking the same guy at the same time; the guy innocently playing the field without coming off as a douchebag; the girls either ignoring jealousy or sublimating their jealousy into an even stronger desire gain the guy\u2019s favor. Ok Darkmoq, it\u2019s unrealistic, so what? You like death match/survival game anime, right? How often does that happen in real life? Why are you hating on the implausibility of the harem genre? Well, two reasons. First, it makes the characters seem completely silly and fickle. It\u2019s very hard to empathize or connect with cardboard characters who have bat shit illogical interactions with each other. Given that ZnT takes a stab at trying to have an actual plot, I gather I\u2019m supposed to care about why characters do things. Second, where do you go from harem? Assuming you can avoid the famed School Days\u2019 ending (which I thought was actually a very logical ending), you either move on (which ZnT doesn\u2019t seem to want to do) or you stay in that harem zone. If you have two characters bonding over a difficult struggle in one episode only to have one of them ogle cleavage for the next 24 minutes in the next episode, then it kind of limits how much the characters can progress.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Louise as a tsundere but I don\u2019t know if I can get through 2 more seasons of the same jokes and slapstick. I did like how the harem wasn\u2019t completely one-sided and how ZnT flirted with male jealousy. Let me put it like this, Louise has options besides Saito and she\u2019s not so instantly love-struck as to rule out her other offers. Compare that to HoTD, where the male protagonist by minute-3 takes a shovel to the (albeit zombified) head of the one guy who could pose any competition to his harem. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It\u2019s cute and sweet at times, and has a story to tell. It\u2019s also repetitive and filler-laden with inconsistent character progression and some lazy writing. \\n\\n\r\nBlood/Gore: The fight scenes were pretty tame even by PG-13 standards. Not boring though.\\n\r\nLove/Romance: I addressed this earlier. If you\u2019re willing to look past the ecchi then it\u2019s there.\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: non-nude ecchi.",

            "content": "Zero No Tsukaima was one of the best comedy animes I've watched... at least the first two seasons, so let's just focus on those. Zero No Tsukaima is about Saito, a guy who suddenly appears in a fantasy world, he was accidentally summoned by Louise, a student in a magic school. Then he gains a power that gives him special abilities with all kinds of weapons and he'll use that on his adventures n\u2019 shit while he gets slaved around by Louise. The art-style in this one is really cute and I never felt like skipping the openings. The plot is good and the charactersare really lovable, I hate tsunderes... but Louise just got the best of me, she was like my first serious waifu. The fight scenes are pretty... meh, but that isn't the main point of the series since it's more romance and adventure-based. This anime was made by the same creators of Toradora and you can really tell they're really alike in a lot of things. So, if you like good romance and fantasy worlds, you should check this one out.",

            "content": "Story: 6\r\nThe story could have been better. It dragged on for too long and some parts, and really struggled to try to be funny. Most of the time I figured, \"Oh the writer wants this to be funny. It was hardly worth a chuckle, that's too bad\". The characters do stuff with magic and have magical pets that are not that funny either. The magic serves it's purpose for the most part, but it mostly serves as a mask to try to keep the show interesting with its mostly lack-luster ability to provide humor. So the story gets a 6 which is like a Din the American grading scale for barely passing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nImportantly the art is clean, even though it is a bit simplistic. Sometimes simplicity can be a good thing, but it was a little too much. Like the magical pets, is that beautiful man's pet a mole, or is it his poo?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThe characters could barely hold my interest, they were very generic and just above the threshold of tolerable. In other words just very average. The characters and their interactions were integral to the enjoyment of this series. Though they are not very likable, yet dislike able at the same time. When they talk and I am supposed to laugh, it makes me not really want to laugh, but sometimes I smile for their minuscule glimmer of charm.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nZero Familiars is a show that tries to be funny, but falls short in many of its comedic setups. Though the characters are a bit generic, they are the driving force behind the anime and pass by their small amount of merit. In nutshell, this show is just as average as they come. Also the title can be misleading, it says zero familiars but there are familiars everywhere. But it actually refers to how much this anime stands in comparison to other familiar anime in its genre.",

            "content": "-Project Zakuro Reviews: Familiar of Zero-\r\nLike tsunderes? Like magic? Needless to say, this anime has all of them. Familiar of Zero was an anime that despite being released in 2006 hasn't caught my attention until much recently. A lot of people seem to claim Familiar of Zero as the sister anime to Shakugan no Shana due to their similar traits or that it is a blatant ripoff of J.K. Rowling's greatest written literature of all time. Is this anime overlooked because of these aspects? Well then, let's find out.\r\nWatching the first episode, I can immediately tell where all the inspiration came from to build thebase of the anime. A magic academy in a fantasy world, uniforms with capes, the dinning halls, some character similarities, it can all be traced back to the ever popular Harry Potter. My first impressions were that I thought this anime was going to copy the exact same formula and become this blatant ripoff that everyone was talking about. While this anime did copy these traits to some extent, luckily not everything was ripped and everything diverged very quickly from what everyone speculated to be. The story's main character Louise (one of the four tsundere wonders) is a mediocre mage who can't seem to pull off a single spell without it resulting in an explosion. Because of this, everyone calls her \"zero\". Time and time again, Louise got frustrated for each failure and got ever determined, even during the familiar summoning test. To Louise's surprise, she succeeded in summoning a familiar but not in the way she turned it out to be. Her familiar was a human commoner named Saito and despite her disappointment, unfortunately Louise cannot undo the summoning so she is stuck with him. Saito however is not just any commoner, he's a Japanese boy sent from his world by Louise's spell and has a special trait within that she doesn't know. This is where the Shakugan no Shana similarities fit in. Louise: a tsundere, and Saito: a useless male protagonist with a hidden trait, are stuck living together under unusual circumstances and developing a relationship. While I will agree that Familiar of Zero is in fact the sister anime to Shakugan no Shana (considering that both were made by J.C. Staff), it is no direct ripoff of Harry Potter because each trait in Familiar of Zero is unique and doesn't copy the exact formula (yes, I do watch Harry Potter). The moment I pressed through the anime, everything turned out completely different And I was pleased with this outcome. The story is actually well-put together despite some cliches you'll find along way and it will definitely keep you engaged throughout the whole anime. One complaint I have with the story though is that the action scenes are too short and rarely lack emphasis, making them dull. The whole focus seems to mainly shift to the relationship between Louise and Saito rather than keep the balance among everything else. At least Shakugan no Shana attempted action and kept everything in check. Nevertheless, the story is still good and engaging and it will keep you wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs of Familiar of Zero by Eiji Usatsuka are very eye-pleasing to look at and each character is perfectly detailed right down to their shaded screen tones. Although the hairstyles of these characters are somewhat awkward, to me it is a bonus because they are being portrayed realistically. An example of this is Louise's hair style which is shown with natural flows rather than shown perfectly smooth like most anime. The background scenery is also very well done and as an artist myself, landscape artwork always puts a smile on my face. The combination of very good character designs and superb background art makes this anime one of the most beautifully designed anime I have ever seen. Nothing is to light or to dark, just right. The animation is also good with everything running smoothly to the frame rate. One thing I will question though are the flashy transition effects throughout each episode. Was it really necessary to use them every time during a scene break? To me, that was just overkill and I think the anime would've been better off without them in my opinion. Despite this, Familiar of Zero still has good quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe music that plays in Familiar of Zero were in my eyes somewhat reminiscent to the music of Rozen Maiden as some songs bear a striking resemblance whenever I listen to them. Although I do not know if whether or not they were done by the same composer, the music may have been influenced from Rozen Maiden as the songs gave off a similar vibe with their melodies. The music in fact gave me a nostalgia effect as I was watching and each song matches their scenarios quite well (well somewhat I guess). This was still good music nonetheless. However I wish I can say the same for the opening and ending themes. I do not think they're bad but they just didn't appeal to me that well. This may vary however for different people so you may have a different opinion of the opening and ending themes. The voice acting is yet where another similarity of Shakugan no Shana can be found as Louise is voiced by Rei Kugimiya (Shana) and Saito is voiced by Satoshi Hino (Yuji). Similarities aside, most of the characters had good voice overs with a couple of few exceptions. Although I wish the voice overs for the familiars would've been more realistic as they sound so obviously like a human imitating an animal. It could've been far more better if the familiars had realistic sounds that were edited and therefore could've improved the anime and made it better in terms of voice over quality.\\n\\n\r\nFamiliar of Zero has its mixed bag of likable and unlikable characters. The majority of main characters like Siesta, Henrietta, and Kirche all have very likable personalities and each one has a unique development over the course of the anime. Louise however has the most heart-warming development among anyone else as she gets closer and closer to Saito with every passing moment. Even Saito himself shows a display of development from his obliviousness to his good heart to protect. This anime does not disappoint when it comes to likable characters. Now for the unlikable kind. There are a lot of minor characters who fall under this category but I will point out the major offenders. To start off, Guiche just drives me up the wall because I can't stand pretty boy personalities. Lastly are the two main antagonists (whom I won't spoil). One antagonist is way too cliched while the other is not just unlikable but a very hate-able character at that. This has been the first in a long time that any anime has spawned such a hated character that I literally despise. So far, Familiar of Zero has managed to pull off a treasure trove of character personalities ranging from the good, the bad, and the most hated.\\n\\n\r\nFamiliar of Zero to me has been a fun overall experience and I think this anime deserves more credibility than it already has. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good anime experience. If you have watched Shakugan no Shana and/or just like tsundere love stories in general, than this anime is definitely for you.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Evaluation: Give it a try.\\n\\n\r\n-Dedicated to Noboru Yamaguchi: the creator who passed away on April 2013 after his long battle with cancer.

            "content": "This anime is a comedy romance about Saito and Louise (excellent voiced by Kugimiya Rie). Louise is a real Tsundere being loud, screaming, mad and jealous most of the time but also having a shy and lovely side. On the other side there is Saito who resembles the hero and also being the girl magnet.\r\nBasically Zero no Tsukaima is about Louise who sucks at magic and Saito whom she summons as a familiar from the future. Of course that counted as a failure and now she has to live with her new \"pet\"(also called stupid dog) which does not agree quite with his master. Sothat is where the story and the problems start.\\n\r\nWhat happens is that Saito slowly starts to get closer to Louise and they both experience some adventures get to know each other better and including their friends around them and act hilarious as master and pet as well. The funny thing is that Louise's jealousy is literally hitting Saito up quite a lot for his inobidience and lovley actions with the other girls around him.\\n\\n\r\nThe style is nothing particular or overwhelming but it is kept cute enough. Especially the way Louise looks like. It is just lovely and the other characters look also all nice.\\n\r\nFor the story parts it is just okay. It follows a story and it is also featuring its sad moments but the basis of the whole anime is anyway the love story between Louise and Saito. And now for the music; very nice and suiting. A more flashy opening and then the very cute ending show well both sides of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow for what I have to say about it. It is a very enjoyable anime with lots of sweet and funny moments. It tells a here a romantic fairy-tale in the times of magic and swords. There are also the moments where a little bit ecchi comes out but it is all just kept to a decent amount and doesn't concentrate on it. Also I couldn't find too many negative things and they are not worth mentioning because this anime will entertain you the way it is. I'm talking only about the 1st season now because the others are a little bit different. But that shouldn't matter because if you search something with lots of charme, comedy and romance then this should be a great anime.",

            "content": "An cute series, filled with tropes and predictable gags. Louise is a bugling mage who accidentally summons Saito from modern day Japan to be her familiar. What ensues is a \"love\" story about a tsundere who can't express her true feelings and the dense guy who loves her. Romantic Comedy ensues. While the first season has some charming moments by the third season the gags are running thin, by the fourth season you just want to shoot yourself. How two people who 'love\" each other can have the same misunderstanding time and time again is beyond me. A little character development would have gone along way to help this series out, instead it relies on the same song and dance, time and time again. Any development that does happen is hastly undone minutes into the following episode, or within the episode itself, as if the writer had some sort of pathological fear of change. If you are like me and you don't want to be banging your head against the wall in frustration do yourself a favor and watch the first season, then watch the last 5 mins of the last episode of the final season, there is your pay off.",

You can put your mind in neutral and just enjoy.\r\nThere is a lot wrong with Zero no Tsukaima. The animation is not very good, The story feels like its of secondary importance, you can see the plot twists a mile away and it has just about every harem cliche in the book but somehow it works.\r\nThe main reason it works is that itknows its own limitations. It sticks to what it is good at. And that is the relationship between Saito and Louise. From the moment Saito falls from the sky after being summoned by Louise we have a nice romantic comedy and like all the best harem comedies Saito sticks with Louise rather than work his way around all the girls. Also Saito discovering bit by bit of previous connections between his world and Louise's.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the comedy is between Saito and Louise which is mainly Saito's wandering eye getting him in to trouble with Louise yet he manages to do it in so many different ways that it never gets old.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all very good but what is Zero no Tsukaima about. Well it is about Louise the worst student at a Magic Academy in a world where only aristocrats have magic ability. As part of her studies she must summon a familiar. Seeing her classmates summon some pretty cool familiars Louise summons Saito a boy from from Japan.\\n\\n\r\nLouise at first treats Saito as a normal familiar, making him sleep on a pile of straw and feeding him scraps and getting frustrated at his refusal to obey her but slowly comes to realise that Saito is a human being. However, her pride stops her from not treating him like a servant and punishing him when he does wrong yet gets insanely jealous, becoming completely tsundere, when Saito talks or looks at other girls. Unfortunately for Saito is all the time.\\n\\n\r\nTogether they embark a number of adventures  and despite Saito's wandering eye he ways is there to protect Louise when she is in danger. A fact that Louise comes to appreciate and slowly accepts her romantic feelings for Saito showing her venerability like all good tsundere characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a plot against the Queen, a war and a fantasy host bar run a muscly transvestite. \\n\\n\r\nA nice simple romantic comedy, nothing more nothing less but the all better for it.",

The art is another thing that adds to the overall viewing experience as well,the animation is very solid and bright and detailed even though it is to be expected for a short anime. The music is also another enjoyable thing about the anime as well and it adds depth to some incredible and emotional moments and makes you care a lot about what's going on.The characters in Zero no tsukaima are few but they all have different and unique personalities and you actually do care about most of them at all times.There is a lot to be enjoyed watching this anime even though it is only 13 episodes long,it is a lot of great enjoyment contained in a short amount of time. Overall i would say this anime is great and anyone would like it.",

Things also get a bit predictable, however not predictable enough to spoil the fun. \r\nI liked the character design in this series.. not sure why, but Louise had a certain flair that I don't see in many female characters.. and no,it'snot the whip.\\n\\n\r\nNot bad at all.",

I was expecting to watch a ecchi/comedy that would end up being flavorless like so many before it. After the first episode, I was left rather excited to watch the next episode. This kept happening, however there were 1 or 2 episodes that I felt bored watching.\r\nStory: The Story in this Anime is cute. Its about a girl named Louis. She is also known Louis the Zero for the fact that she fails in magic as amage. The story opens with her being a hot-headed little ball of fire. Which was nice compared to my prediction of it being a story about a cluts. It begins to unfold when the class has a lesson on summoning familiars, it leads to a suprise that sets the story in motion.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this Anime is decent. Its nothing to get hyped about, but it does the job. The characters and creatures all look cute, the background blends in with the world. Overall its alright and bearable. It isn't top notch like other animes, but this is expected with age.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voices in this Anime are great! The fit the characters. Louis is bratty sounding, the protagonist comes off as innocent, the seducer sounds how you would expect and the music fits the scenes. The openings have decent music and the battle scenes sound effects fit well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in this story are good. They fit cliches and tend to intermingle in a hilarious way. There isn't much ecchi in it, so the characters don't come off as needed for lewd ideas. There is some perversion which adds to the comedy. The characters are memorable and good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is a good Anime worth watching. It has plenty of comedy, romance, and drama. It is great for those just getting into Anime and is enjoyable. There are few moments of boredom and a great amount of action. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance and or action Anime.",

There are a lot of sexual references but it is justified in a way that the characters acknowledge this, for example: the main female protagonist has no boobs, whereas the majority of other female characters do, which annoys her and is mentioned frequently, so this contributes to the story moreso rather than to fan-service.\r\nI enjoyed this so much and if youlike comedy, romance, fantasy and some ecchi elements I suppose, I would really recommend giving this anime series a try, it gets better in every series :D\\n\r\n(cant wait to get this on DVD! :') )",

But a major problem in the series is that there slow in showing the true feeling of the character, and a little bit pervy (though there are worse series). \r\nIf i say the truth, there are moments that will automatically make you cry (unless your cold hearted) and the story line is perfect for those who like fiction and magical series!! it shows power, hstory andtwists as some person being really special ^^",

            "content": "The anime begins with the (semi)-main protagonist, Louis Francois, a young magician girl, attending class.\r\n3 minutes into the first episode and several explosions later, we learn that her name \"Louis the Zero\" derives from her success rate at magic: zero.\r\nZero no Tsukaima can be translated several different ways, but the most common in English is \"The Zero's Familiar\".\r\nAfter this nice explosive intro, Louis must perform a summoning ritual. It is a sacred ceremony that allows a Noble (magic-users) to summon a beast to become their familiar (with those that aren't familiar with the term... well... familiar, it means something like that of a \"pet\" or&quot;servant&quot;, generally an animal of some sort).\\n\\n\r\nEveryone around Louis summons amazing familiars, everything from dragons to moles.\\n\\n\r\nWhile giving her turn a try, she summons our second protagonist: a boy.\\n\\n\r\nSaito, our typical Japanese boy, winds up stuck with Louis, and through the anime becomes known as the &quot;Gandalfr&quot;; a being that can use any weapon made for war without any prior knowledge of that weapon through the runes on his hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe love between Louis and Saito is constantly threatened throughout the series and extends far into the 2nd and 3rd seasons (Fukatsuki no Kishi / Princess no Rondo).\\n\\n\r\nThe story, in my opinion, is overplayed in many anime's. There've always been wars, and, for some really, really annoying reason, it plays NO part in the anime whatsoever until the very end. The artwork is astounding (although not as good as the manga's). The sound is great, original, and flows with the anime. The characters are typical, but enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe series was very much enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this series a 9/10.",

The story is actually pretty good as well as the art but it lacked more character developement which the anime tried to get into but didn't finish. Hopefully more about the characters will be added in the future of the series. Emotional moments were there but lacked the power to draw you in with the exception of a few scenes.",
