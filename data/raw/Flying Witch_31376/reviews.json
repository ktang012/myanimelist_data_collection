            "content": "Flying Witch is possibly the best iyashikei (healing) anime ever made. If you love Aria, Non Non Biyori, and the Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou OVAs, then this is a must-see series. Flying Witch stands out because it makes even Aria look action-packed. Every moment of every episode unfolds naturally and organically; there's a very subtle but unmistakable message that humans (witch or otherwise) are truly inseparable from the earth, plants, wind, and sky. There's no overt conflict, no overly energetic comedy bits, and really no plot. I have no idea how an entire episode dedicated to the coming of spring, taking a few walks, and pickingfresh wildflower buds for tempura can be utterly captivating, but that's why Flying Witch is so magical.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that's particularly refreshing is that all the characters, even ones from the magical world, are portrayed in a very realistic manner. Instead of relying on eccentric behavior to drive the story, the show just lets people be themselves. This is particularly important for the character of Chinatsu, a grade-school girl who's the younger cousin of Makoto (the titular witch of the series). It's great to see her reactions because she doesn't act like any of the anime tropes you might expect to encounter, nor is she given any odd quirks to make her more of a stand-out (e.g. Renge from Non Non Biyori). Chinatsu's just a normal kid, and that alone makes her a rare and wonderful creation. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, Chito, Makoto\u2019s cat and familiar, actually acts and is animated like a real cat. Chito can be lazy, likes taunting the neighborhood dog, and goes on inscrutable adventures that only another cat could truly understand. I\u2019ve followed a few cats on their adventures in my time and Chito is exactly like those real world felines. There\u2019s a wonderful moment in Episode 5 when Chito decides to take a nap with Chinatsu, and the animators take the time to depict Chito circling around a few times before finally settling down. This is exactly what every cat ever actually does, and this show has the generosity to let Chito be true to Chito. All anime cats should be so lucky.\\n\\n\r\nGenerosity is perhaps the best word to describe Flying Witch. One can\u2019t help but notice the small kindnesses that every episode contains. Whether it\u2019s helping out with simple household chores, ensuring that a caterpillar finds a safe spot to feed on fresh leaves, or keeping a new friend company while she runs errands, one is constantly reminded of how these tiny actions are often so much more meaningful than the occasional grand gesture. \\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch is a moment of utter serenity in the frenetic world of anime, and its real magic is in giving its viewers the chance to reflect on the smallest moments in daily life and realize that those can be the most enchanting of all. Flying Witch shows that a butterfly\u2026or a caterpillar\u2026is as beautiful and moving as a cathedral.",

            "content": "Do you want a show that is serene, tranquil, and perfect for relaxation? Maybe you are tired of how action-packed and over-the-top most anime are? Perhaps you want to relieve yourself of all the worries in real life and just enjoy the ride?\r\nRegardless, I invite you to enter the world of Flying Witch. It is not heavy, exciting, or full of action. In fact, it meanders through quite uneventful situations. However, it is truly the pinnacle of slice of life as far as feeling good goes. It's a beautiful concoction of peaceful music, a laid-back setting, and genuinely sweet characters doing everyday things with noworry or tension and magic thrown in. While more demanding audiences may find it dull, I can safely recommend it those who just want something sweet and soothing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other relaxing shows out there, like Non Non Biyori, K-On!, and the Suzumiya Haruhi Series to name a few, but not very many of them can create such a perfectly built universe that seems separate and devoid of anime clich\u00e9s and stereotypes. It is merely a tale of a girl named Makoto visiting her family in the outskirts with her cat. However, their daily activities aren't very ordinary. In fact, they regularly involve magic. Think of it like Aria or Yokohama Shopping Log with fantasy flavor. Makoto herself is a witch and their everyday events include anything from planting a mandrake to helping a friend turn back into a human from a furry to visiting a Ghibli-esque caf\u00e9 with regular customers that include ladybugs, foxes, and invisible people. The magical elements blend in so seamlessly, it's as if they're natural. It adds a level of extra beauty to an otherwise run of the mill story.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters are very memorable. They all have stunning chemistry together and their conversations flow with ease. Each of them also have many personality traits that adds a level of familiarity that most SoL anime don't have. While I was watching it, I didn't feel like I was just watching characters talking with each other. I felt like they were genuine people that I knew closely. Don't expect them to be well-developed or complex though.\\n\\n\r\nNow I come to the big issue - Unfortunately, not everyone will appreciate Flying Witch. Regardless of how cute and cuddly it is, a large portion of the audience will find it boring. There is no overall plot, no drama, no conflict, no character development, and no degree of complexity. Those who want something exciting, thrilling or deep won't get what they're looking for. I had to be in an undemanding mood to enjoy it to the fullest, so I found myself bored while watching it some days.\\n\\n\r\nThe production was done by the masters of slice of life themselves, J.C.Staff. Like all their shows, the animation is rather standard. It doesn't look choppy or ugly but certainly doesn't boast anything special. The designs are very typical but don't stick out as terrible or anything. I can say the visuals fit the calm style of the narrative but only that much.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, it does a good job of being soothing and restful but like the visuals, it's not fantastic. Most of the soundtrack is composed of calm piano and flute pieces, as well as some stringed music. None of the tracks in particular are very memorable but as a whole, it does its job. The opening, on the other hand, can be described in one word - Cute. With the adorable dance routine, upbeat song, and colorful visuals, you can't help but feel warm inside after watching it. It does a very good job of preparing for what's to come. There is also something special about the voice acting. Quite simply, the VAs sound genuine. None of them deliver squeaky or overly obnoxious roles (unlike a good portion of slice of life), so it sounds very nice.\\n\\n\r\nSo, sit back, relax, drink a cup of tea, sit on your couch, and enjoy the ride. Are you having a bad day? It will be a great remedy for that. In the end, what you have is definitely a basic slice of life type of show - but one of the best ones out there. Even if you're a cold-hearted bastard and spawn of Cthulu, you should still get something out of it.",

            "content": "Flying Witch, a show that pretty much speaks for itself judging by the title. Yes, it\u2019s literally a series about a flying witch named Makoto and her friends. Yes, it has magic in the series because what else would witches excel in? And yes, this is the type of magical story that will entice you in such a comfortable charm that you won\u2019t ever forget.\r\nThe series is adapted from the manga of the same name and essentially, it\u2019s a hybrid of slice of life and fantasy. We follow the life of Kowata Makoto as she returns to living in a rural town with her friendsand relatives. In essence, it explores the daily life style of how Makoto gets around while also developing her magical skills as the flying witch. Her friends and family guides her while we also learn about their characters. There is no linear storytelling as each episode seems to be an episodic adventure of itself. However, that\u2019s what actually makes Flying Witch so special because just how unique the show can be as we see its imaginativity.\\n\\n\r\nA good deal of the enjoyment about the series comes from the characters. It\u2019s a small yet diverse and unique cast because every character has their own attributes and characteristics. Makoto is the polite type of girl with a down to earth type of personality yet also has a problem of getting lost. Throughout the series, this humorous gag is played as we see how clueless she can be with directions. Then, there\u2019s Chinatsu Kuramoto (Makoto\u2019s cousin). As a younger character, it comes to no surprise that she is curious about the world around her and the people she meets. Furthermore, she has a peculiar interest in magic after seeing it with her very own eyes. It\u2019s also interesting to note that Chinatsu gets a decent amount of development as she experiences with magic as well. Akane Kowata is the witch of the series, literally. She is not just the older sister of Makoto but also acts as her mentor figure as well. However, unlike Makoto, Akane is more of an airhead and often speaks what\u2019s on her mind no matter how brutally honest it is. Despite that, she deeply cares about her family and we can see that she has a gentle heart. From Chinatsu\u2019s family side, we also have Kei Kuramoto who serves more of the older brother type. Although by personality, I find that he is more similar to Akane with his down to earth personality. It\u2019s these characters that gets a good deal of emphasis and each episode explores their relationship in the story. And to be quite honest, it\u2019s quite special.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, you\u2019re probably asking yourself: what should I really expect from Flying Witch? Do we just get to see a typical slice of life/fantasy story that we may or may not like? While the pacing of the series may feel sluggish, it\u2019s the atmospheric feel and ways to embrace the fantasy genre that really can win fans over. Throughout the show, there\u2019s all type of supernatural gags that makes their appearances ranging from sonic screeching mandrakes, flying whales, mysterious ghosts, and even anthropomorphic characters that can transform into a dog. Familiars such as cats and hamsters are also no stranger in this series either. The point is that the series wants the viewers to experience what it has to offer by bringing all sorts of content to the table. It succeeds in this by bringing a sense of magical realism by combining elements of supernatural with daily life experiences. \\n\\n\r\nFrom a story perspective, the series can stray some viewers from pursuing further into the series as at times, the pacing can feel uninteresting. If you\u2019re dying for some magical action, then you\u2019re looking at wrong place. This isn\u2019t some series about witches trying to take over the world. In fact, Flying Witch emphasizes a lot about its premise and themes rather than story development. I confess to myself that the series is perhaps one of the most charming shows I\u2019ve watched in recent years. Just for the fact that each episode, there\u2019s the graceful feeling the series brings in with its character and setting. Even the comedy, which I wasn\u2019t sold on at first, convinced me that the series is a rare gem. It\u2019s down to earth humor that is very consistent about what it tries to do. In the meantime, I\u2019m also satisfied with the directing of the series despite that it follows more of a rearranged adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff helms the series and it\u2019s quite an elegant feeling you\u2019ll see with its artwork. Characters look simple yet makes you wonder what to expect about them. There\u2019s a refreshing feel whenever you see characters like Makoto on a broomstick or Chinatsu with witch aesthetics on. The familiars are also convincing that blurs the line between magical realism. Even the setting of a rural town is crafted quite well with a countryside feel that is nostalgic.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and music plays an important part of the series as it brings the atmospheric feeling to life. The overall tone of the show has a gentle tone and is wonderfully put together with its soft instruments. Both the OP and ED theme songs are also lighthearted and reminds us how charming the series can be. Furthermore, I have to give praise for the overall voice mannerism of the series as they sound exactly as their personalities is reflected.\\n\\n\r\nAh Flying Witch. Dubbed by some fans as \u201cComfy\u201d, it\u2019s definitely a show that is recommendable to just about anyone. From the unique cast of characters to magical realism, it\u2019s a series that takes slice of life and fantasy to a creative level. What you expect is what you will get. And that is, a show about flying witches, familiars, and giving you a comfy time. \\n",

            "content": "The title \"Flying witch\" suggests there will be flying and magics. I think both happen maybe once in each episode and that's it. But it's not a bad thing, it's just regular 'slice of life' anime.\r\nStory follows young witch Makoto living with her relatives in some nice countryside. The vibe really reminds me of \"Non non biyori\" - almost no people in the background, just main characters doing everyday things. Well, sometimes 'everyday things for a witch', but it's not flashy fireworks show. I really liked that, the magic rituals shown are simple - no lights, no wind, mainly drawing magic circles, using small itemsand awaiting effect. Flying on a broom is a way to travel around town, no racing or great speeds, just floating short distances.\\n\\n\r\nYou've seen these characters before - 7/10\\n\r\nUnfortunately nothing great in terms of characters, but they work nicely in this enviroment.\\n\\n\r\nSome nice ideas - 9/10\\n\r\nThe witches are among us, and so are some interesting ideas about how they live, and what other magical things there are in the world.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening is great, you will clap along in no time.

            "content": "Take it easy, relax, and join in the fun. Flying witch's is perhaps one of the best titles to get snuggle up and \"comfy\" with.\r\nFlying witch was indeed a \"comfy\" title. Without a doubt \"comfy\" is the best word to describe the series. Flying Witch is a fantasy title that follows the 15-year-old witch Makoto Kowata and other supporting characters in her daily life.  Because the show is considered \"Slice of Life\" the story and plot are slow. The  slow pacing of the story-telling is actually a good thing, it makes it easy to follow along, and in addition to that, you canenjoy what the story has to offer, which is one of the many things I appreciated about this title. What's fascinating about Flying witch is that the show has a distinct Studio Ghibli feel to it. Ghibli films were always full of imaginative worlds, full of wonder and exploration. More than likely you will read this in many other reviews, with that out the way, let's continue. Flying witch is the \"ideal\" example  of a show with the following genres' \"supernatural\" and  \"slice of life\" done right.  The original author Chihiro Ishizuka must have had extensive knowledge and a lengthy amount of experience working on supernatural and slice of life titles. Because none of her work is listed anywhere, I'm going to assume that she has worked on various titles in the past and went unaccredited. If this is truly her first work then I must say that the way the anime was able to portray her work was very well done. The show offers quite a lot of lighthearted comedy which is backed up with little things like odd reaction faces (which I always found hilarious,) silly little jokes and gestures, that sort of thing. More than likely you won't be laughing your ass off to much. As for the lasting appeal the story has to offer, I feel like the show didn't really stand out that. This is perhaps due to the releases of bigger titles like Kabeneri of the Iron Fortess, Re:, and Boku no Hero Academia. When you read the Synopsis of Flying witch, in comparison to the mainstream titles listed above I'd say more viewers would watch those of witch. Last few things I'm going to add is that Flying witch's story, while not as deep as I expected, does in fact have moments that tug at the heart-strings at bit. It's so well part together that I may or may not have had tears in my eyes... \\n\\n\r\nFlying witch delivered visually spectacular animation! Settings, objects, all boated very high quality animation that was both frequently & heavily used during various scenes. The beauty of the background settings, water, trees, grass plains, the quality was beautiful! I could see that the animators added a few CGI objects & textures to add a sense of realism to certain things, again, like water, clouds, and ground objects etc. Seeing the reflection of objects in the water, the rough detail added in the stone,simply brilliant. Yasuhiro Okumura and Yoshio okouchi went all out, in details of the objects like wooden floors, tables etc.  Character designs were pretty amazing too. I loved the silly reaction faces the Characters would make. This coupled along with the moods shown on their faces . J.C.Staff really outdid themselves when it came to adding details and such to characters faces and body movement. Expressing the way a characters facial features, body movement, and emotions when they  would react to supernatural moments had a somewhat overly dramatic, yet was almost human-like. I do not doubt that J.C. Staff brought in real people (most likely workers there) and used Motion capture suits to add more realism in the already majestic & magical fantasy world that is Flying Witch. Perhaps the only thing that bothered me is the reflection spots on the characters noses, just that little odd spot. With very little doubt, I can say proudly that Flying Witch had \"the best\" animation I've seen so far this Spring season. Outstanding job done by J.C. Staff!\\n\\n\r\nI love the intro song, it really gets me excited to watch the show and singing & start clapping along with the song like a mentally disturbed man-child.  Every episode I would deliberately forget to skip the intro to sing along, as if I was a child watching Barney, or sesame street, or whatever children's programming is on now-a-days, damn if I know. The way that the intro song is performed reminds me of a late 90's and early 2000's catchy anime opening. To be more specific it kind of reminds me of Azumanga Daioh's intro, remember? Lu La lu La piano wa sekai no yumesaku nohara ni melody... Ready to sing along and then get right into the show and have a blast watching. The background music played in Flying witch was fantastic too. It's sort of like music played to fit with whatever is going on at the moment. That music really enhanced the quality of scenes full of magic, and certain parts in the show where the girls were taking part in some sort of adventure. Ghibli comes to mind again because as I mentioned earlier just about every song in a majority of the films has a beautiful and relaxing musical score that helps intesfies viewers expiernce while watching their films. Flying Witch shares that simular trait. Voice actors were perhaps my favorite thing in the sound department. Second favorite, because you know, the opening song is #1. I think that the voice actors did a magnificent job delivering their lines along with perfectly executing the over the top reaction lines/responses. Each character had their own distinctive, unique, &  charming qualities to them. This makes the show both friendly and appealing to whomever decides to watch it. It's actually rather difficult for me to add anything of usefulness to the characters because I feel like my character section would turn out to be very opinionated. So with that, Let me add that the cast is memorable, their interactions with each other is always fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot think of one thing I didn't enjoy about Flying witch. The comedy, jokes though light was often times funny and kept me going through the story. The plot  for different episodes always had something of interest and charm to deliver. Enough though I didn't feel like it had enough \"magic\" for a supernatural title, I was still impressed with everything that was presented in the end. I enjoyed getting time to discover new things with the main characters. Speaking of characters each of the main cast had  left me with good impressions of them. Expect for Kei.. he was boring as a character. Makoto, Akane Nao, MamaKuramoto and Chinatsu were the characters I enjoyed seeing the most in this series. Each of them had both fun and loving aspects to their own unique personalities which made the show all the more enjoyable for me. If I had to choose what was my favorite thing about flying witch was, I would probably say all of it. The show was so well written, displayed beautiful settings, and had the best music composed to complement that scenery. All of it, all of it put together made for a really amazing title! \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that stopped me from giving Flying Witch a 10/10 was that it lacks replay value. This is the type of title that I would probably own, but not open, nor watch. It would site in my Blu-Ray pile until I remembered that I bought it, despite loving it so much at the time. While most would consider this a polished diamond, I would consider it a hidden gem. It's only great if find it for yourselves that way you're not influenced by others (myself included) opinions about the show.  It makes the experiences of watching Flying Witch all the more valuable.  I had a really pleasant time watching this show  and I would highly recommend it to anyone who can handle slow-paced slice of life titles.",

            "content": "Sha, la,la,laaa, dakedo, exactly what directions does this anime going for????????That's the question which only writer Chihiro Ishizuka and anime director Katsushi Sakurabi can answer, as I watch the last episode of this anime, and all I can say is that it was pretty fucking boring to say the least:\r\nStorywise, it has a setting and a genre, but it's plot about a witch in training was pretty much an complicated form of Parachronism, where one wouldn't understand as to why would a witch in training even live with a family who doesn't even practice witchcraft, let alone that such entity is an abomination to everreligious faith be it Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam, would be in a community who somehow doesn't mind that there is one in their neighborhood. Also the plot is all over the place for an anime with a slice of life genre, it may have a comedy genre, but it wasn't even funny, so poor Flying witch has landed a 3 over 10 on my score card.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise, it was a plain as any anime without an ecchi genre, so it's a 5 over 10, don't expect any panchira, onsen fanservice nor a swimsuit fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nSound, a  7 over 10 since the only consolation here was the opening theme, Sha, la,la, laaa.........it has that sweet feeling to it and it fits that main character as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, it's a 5 over 10 for this category, since the character themselves were plain and boring as they can be.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, since there isn't any scantly in this anime, it as decent as it can be, so 4 over 10..........\\n\\n\r\nBut overall , I'm giving it a 3 since you're more likely to wonder as to why would they even make an anime this boring, than enjoy the show.

            "content": "Flying Witch Review (NO SPOILERS)\r\nHeh. No spoilers. As if this show actually has anything to spoil, in the first place. Ok, then. Flying Witch is one of those shows that I see a screenshot or a short clip of and I think the artwork looks so stinkin good, that I just gotta go see the entire show. And unfortunately... that doesn't always lead me to the best of shows... If I were to describe Flying Witch in one word, it would be \"nothing\". That's the gist of it. NOTHING happens in this show. So you're thinking \"Oh, then it's a slice of life show?\" Iguess??? But it's the most eventless and dull lifestyle that you'll ever witness. Now, I said that there isn't anything to spoil in this show, and there really isn't. But I will be going over some events in the show, as well as the overall beginning set up, just so I can better describe things. Don't worry, though. I swear that you won't be getting spoiled on anything groundbreaking, no matter how much detail I give you.\\n\\n\r\nSo as the name of the show implies, this show stars a witch, named Makoto. Now you may be thinking \"Ok, a witch. So there's probably some cool magic and otherworldly events in this show, right?\" Nope... Well... there is, but it's almost entirely non existent. What I mean is that a lot of the magic in Flying witch is either done through reciting words, writing a spell or drawing a symbol, or through jump cuts that have NO flashy transition that even acknowledges that something magic even happened. For example, there's this cafe in the show, run by a witch. But the cafe looks like an abandoned, destroyed building. What they gotta do is a series of gestures, to make the cafe's true appearance show itself. You see them looking at the destroyed building, cut to their faces and bodies, doing the gestures, and then cut to the building being completely different. No transition. No sound effects. Nothing. Another thing is the flying. Makoto doesn't entirely know how to fly, at the beginning of the show. That gets mentioned around episode 4 or 5, or something like that. So you'd think we'd watch her trying to learn how to fly. But no. On the second to last episode or so, there's a scene that has Makoto flying on her broom. One of the characters mentions how well she's flying. And she just says \"Oh, ya. I finally mastered it.\" And that's it. It's never brought up, again. There's even a part where a non witch character starts training to become a witch. She asks for her parent's permission and they just say yes, with no hesitation. And then that's it. She never gets any magic powers throughout the show, but she's apparently now in training to become a witch. And that's the end of that.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're watching this show for its magic elements, don't. They're the most nonexistent non extravagant magic elements you ever see, or rather not see, in any anime ever. So how about the slice of life aspect of the show? Is that any good? Well... not really. It doesn't have any sort of plot, in any of the episodes. Not even any episodic ones, like Ouran Host Club or Fruits Basket. And it isn't funny in the slightest, like Azumanga Daioh. This show is all about existence. Just straight up existence, in the blandest way possible. There's about .0001% of magic, thrown into the mix of it, but that's all. Now a show about simple existence isn't always a bad thing, when the characters are at least interesting to watch. So... are these characters interesting to watch? Take a guess... Just like how the show can be described as \"nothing\", all of the characters can be described as \"nobody\". Not a single one of them has a personality. At all. I could not describe these characters, if my life depended on it. I even went and looked up the character descriptions for everyone on MyAnimeList, and even THEY can't describe these characters in more than 1 or 2 sentences. Probably my favorite description was for one of the main characters, Chinatsu. Her description is \"Younger sister of Kei. She dislikes bake because she thinks it's for adults.\" That about sums it all up, right there.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all nice people. That's about as much as I can say to describe them. Nice. They're always nice to each other. There isn't a single bit of conflict in the entire show. I could probably count on one hand, all of the sentences in all of the dialogue of the entire show that had even the slightest bit of conflict in them. There's literally nothing else to say about it. There's no conflict. No problem solving. No plot twists. No nothing. This is a show about nothing, starring a bunch of nobodies. As for the music, it's just as bland and nonexistent as the show, so at least it flows well with the show it's attached to. Still, you won't remember any of the songs in this show. Not even the opening or ending. The opening and ending are generic in both sound and visuals. Completely skippable. There's no english dub as of right now, so you're only option is sub. The voice acting is fine. No problems with it, at least. Though, if there ever is a dub, you may think this is a good show to have play in the background, while you do something else. Though, personally, I think it'd be better to leave the visuals in the background, and don't even worry about listening to what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is probably the best thing in the entire show. That's the whole reason I decided to watch this show, in the first place. The animation was done by J.C. Staff, a company that has worked on MANY other shows, and many that are far better than this one. Such as the previously mentioned Azumanga Daioh, Toradora, and one of my favorite shows, Little Busters. The animation in Flying Witch is really stinkin good. Scenery is beautiful and the characters are nicely detailed, despite their boring designs. HOWEVER. There is ONE thing in the animation that REALLY bugs me. And that is the character's noses. I know that that's a weird thing to complain about, but the character's noses all have this little light ring bubble on them, and it's VERRRRRRRY annoying to look at. Right from episode 1, that stupid light ring thingy bugged me, to no end. And it stays there, throughout the entire show. But other than that, the animation is near perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing left to talk about is that there are some OVA episodes, for Flying Witch. There are 9 episodes, each being no more than 2 minutes long, and being animated in a chibi CG art style. As for the plot of these OVA's... they have just as much of a plot as the regular show. In other words... nothing at all. So in conclusion, Flying Witch is nothing special in the absolute slightest. I don't think I'll ever be watching it, again. Though, I can't really say I HATED it, as weird as that sounds. It wasn't a bother to watch, being only 12 episodes. It was easy to follow, since there's literally nothing to follow, in the first place. It's nice to look at, and it may be fun to watch with your kids or younger siblings, since this is one of the few anime series that is actually appropriate for a very young audience. If you wanna watch this show to relax, I GUESS I can recommend it for that. Though, to save you some time, I would only recommend watching episodes 7, 8, 11, and 12. Those were my favorites out of the bunch, and you can honestly see what the entirety of the show is about, just by watching one of them. So ya. That's about it. If you're looking for a good slice of life show, with subtle magic that actually adds to the story, watch one of the Key anime. If you're looking for a slice of life with a plot, watch Ouran. If you're looking for a slice of life with actual comedy and actual characters, watch Azumanga. And if you want a show about literally nothing... watch Flying Witch... \\n\\n\r\nI'm honestly not sure where to leave off this review. On one hand, I was ok with watching this and it certainly wasn't a bother to do so, but on the other hand, I got absolutely NOTHING from watching this. So I'm gonna give this show a bit of a weird final score. If you're willing to watch this type of show and accept that you'll get absolutely nothing from watching it, I can give this show a 5. But if you don't want to watch this type of show, then I'd give it a 0. I know that isn't really a fair rating, since the fact that a show was even able to be created deserves at least SOME respect. In that case, I'll give it a 1. But please know that my rating of 5 doesn't mean the show is decent, and my rating of 1 doesn't mean the show is terrible. I'm giving it a 5, simply because it's the the most indifferent rating I can give. And with this show, I am 100% indifferent to its existence and to my experience watching it.\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch gets either a 1/10 or a 5/10.",

            "content": "Despite the title \"Flying Witch\", the show doesn't really feature a lot of Flying Witches or crazy witch battles. Instead, the show is just a super-relaxing slice-of-life series with a touch of magic. If you've watched titles such as Non Non Biyori then you can expect the same atmosphere from this show. \r\n[Story]\r\nFlying Witch is basically about a 15 year old witch named Makoto who moved into a rural town called Aomori to train as a professional witch. This is where the slice-of-life atmosphere begins. \r\nThe atmosphere of the show is super-relaxing. It's like you want to move out of this god-forsaken noisy/polluted city andjust live the rest of your days in a (almost) pollution-free quiet rural environment. That's what I felt like when I was watching an episode of Flying Witch every week.\\n\\n\r\nI heard that the creators mentioned Flying Witch as an \"iyashikei\" show or in English, a \"healing\" anime show. It's purpose is to basically have a healing or soothing effect on the audience, such as myself. The creators were right! I'm usually always busy on the weekends and having a show like Flying Witch calming down my stress level every week is a huge benefit for me. So not only does the show have a relaxing atmosphere but its \"iyashikei\"effect completely works and is the only reason why some of you lots shouldn't kill yourself. \\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch is definitely not for everyone and I can tell based on a few reviews/opinions that I've heard from other people. Nothing much happens throughout the show and the pacing is very slow. This might put off people who aren't a fan of slice-of-life genre and some might even find this show extremely boring. That's completely understandable because not everyone wants to watch a character following a cat around the town for an entire episode or drinking at a cafe for half of the episode. However to me, scenes such as the one I recently listed, weren't boring at all. They executed it in a way that made a scene like a character following a cat around the town for an entire episode not boring at all. \\n\\n\r\nOne last aspect that I want to talk about is the comedy. They are well done. The comedy isn't forced and they just let the characters do their thing while at the same time, not overdoing it so the funny moments doesn't turn stale. For example, Makoto is somewhat of a klutz and has a bad sense of direction. The show used them to make hilarious moments but they didn't overdo it to the point where she would come off as a dumb character. The character dynamics are also great and they really know how to pair these characters up to create a bunch of cute, heart warming and/or hilarious moments. Also, I forgot to mention that Chinatsu's reactions in the first few episodes are hilarious. It's a kind of reaction that you'd expect when seeing something so bizarre happening right in front of your eyes and just comes of as unbelievable at first.  What makes it even more hilarious is the fact that she's just a 9-year old kid and she's seeing something that she'd never expect that she'll see. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nLooking at Flying Witch's visuals and animation makes me somewhat excited at how future J.C Staff's anime will look like. This is actually their best visuals yet and it's way better than their previous works such as Index and Railgun. The visuals looks almost like real life at first look and the character designs are well done and it's not as bland as it used to be when comparing this show to their most recent work. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack definitely, and I mean DEFINITELY played a huge role on why the atmosphere is relaxing. The OSTs are phenomenal. Few examples are those slow piano bits or those slow guitar parts with a flute(?) playing at the same time. I really want to import those CD soundtracks. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Sharanran\" by miwa feat. 96 Neko. The OP theme song is absolutely catchy and I have been listening to it for the past 12 weeks. Also, those claps though. The ED theme song is \"Nichijou no Mahou\" by Makoto and Chinatsu. Same case as the OP. I love the song and both voice actors have great singing voices. It's not something that I'd expect from a slice-of-life show though but I guess it works. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. Each and every one of them has a set of unique personalities that makes them likable in their own ways. None of them came off as annoying. Especially, Chinatsu and Makoto who I thought was going to be very annoying at first but after watching the first episode, the way they acted was realistic and it blew my mind. I mean, it's rare to feature a cast of characters with realistic personalities instead of our usual \"Character has to be one of the \"dere\" traits\". For example, Chinatsu was acting like how a kid her age should act and it's hard to believe that Makoto is a 15 year old teenager considering the fact that she's super mature for her age and she likes to do adult stuff like farming, picking out plants and etc. Though, that doesn't mean Makoto acts exactly like an adult. Some of the things she does can come off as rather immature but that's normal since she's just a 15 year old teenager. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said above, the character dynamics are amazing. Pair one of these characters up with another character and you're going to get the same result regardless. A cute, heart-warming, smile-inducing, and funny moments. Chinatsu, Chito-san and Makoto does take the cake though whenever they're on screen.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you were to ask me like who's my favourite characters in the series then it would go something like this:\\n\r\nChinatsu > Chito-san > Akane > Makoto > Nao ..... and etc. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI had low expectations from this series before it aired but after the first few episodes, I ended up enjoying this anime as much as I did watching Non Non Biyori and Non Non Biyori Repeat. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nOut of 3 slice-of-life animes that I watched this season, Flying Witch is, no doubt, the best slice-of-life this season. The show's atmosphere is very relaxing and I'm glad that magic isn't widely used in the series. It shows us magic is one of those mysterious elements in our world. The characters are amazing and the show just lets these characters do whatever it wants, which lead to a bunch of cute, heart-warming, smile-inducing, and funny moments.  Now, I'm bummed out that I won't get my weekly doses of Flying Witch anymore to relieve my stress levels. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+The show's atmosphere is very relaxing\\n\r\n+Relaxing pacing\\n\r\n+Best animation J.C Staff has produced yet\\n\r\n+Very relaxing soundtrack\\n\r\n+Fun cast of characters\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-\\n",

            "content": "Spring 2016 is a season full of highs and lows. I mostly dealt with the latter, making myself too submerged in the negativity. But here comes Flying Witch, a show that has become known by now as a healing experience. Watching the show never fails to improve my mood. Everything about it just screams positivity and sunshine from the calming atmosphere, joyful characters, and the laid-back story. The often atmospheric moments such as scenery shots accompanied with beautiful calming music is truly bliss. The story of a young witch training in unfamiliar yet welcoming territory reminds me a lot of Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service, one ofmy favourite Ghibli films. While it does not offer any actual plot, each episode offers an adventure that constantly introduces supernatural elements and fits them well into the lighthearted slice-of-life approach. It does bother me occasionally that no one really bats an eye that witches live on their daily lives without trying to conceal their identity. The show doesn\u2019t really explain if witches are a norm in the society, or that the characters are just air-headed enough to not really care. \\n\\n\r\nOne main gripe I have with the show is that it could have utilized its story better. The show presents Makoto as a witch in training but we don\u2019t get any actual specifics regarding how the world of witches work aside from other witches that are introduced in the show such as her sister Akane. We get to see some witch stuff happening but it\u2019s mostly shown as amusement though some fit in the \u201cwitch training\u201d department. The show does try to blur the boundary between the two worlds but it would have been great if the show used more than one perspective.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend this show to slice-of-life fans who would like to see something atmospheric, calming, meditative, and positive. It doesn\u2019t use its potential to the fullest but nevertheless a fleeting euphoric experience.\\n",

            "content": "I'll start off by saying kudos, Flying Witch. It really took me by surprise how much I ended up enjoying this show.\r\nI pick up a number of shows per season, and Flying Witch was the one I knew least about. I got a very relaxed vibe from the first few episodes so I stuck with it. By the end of its run I was in awe how much this magical slice of life had won me over.\r\nThe colorful cast of characters we meet over the course of Flying Witch is definitely the standout ingredient here. Your typical slice of life is bound to have 1or 2 unbearable characters, but I honestly loved everyone we came across over this journey; from the various witches like accidental-furry Inukai and the adorable cafe assistant Anzu, to their familiars and the various creatures inhabiting the magical realm. \\n\\n\r\nThe main cast is extremely strong as well. Our witch-in-training Makoto is a very endearing main character. The little quirks like her lack of directional awareness are the greatest combination of goofy and adorable. Makoto's host family is also top-notch (I never understood that, were they related? Or just like really close family-friends? eh, it doesn't really matter). \\n\\n\r\nOlder brother Kei is Makoto's age and has to be praised for how chill he is. I've seriously never seen a dude in anime keep his cool so well around a house full of women. And there's no tacked on relationship between Kei and Makoto either. Their interactions throughout the show are extremely genuine and enjoyable. Everyone's interactions throughout this show are very well done, honestly. Even the parents, who lack the most screen time of the whole family have things to love about them. The mom is extremely mom-like, and the dad's heavy accent always gave me a good laugh, especially when his words flying right over Makoto's head.\\n\\n\r\nBut I have to give the MVP to little sister Chinatsu. She was consistently the funniest and most adorable one of this show. Everything from the way she speaks, to her mannerisms and movements captured the essence of a young girl very well, and the magical atmosphere around her only heightened that great childlike sense of wonder.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on about these characters all day. I'd love to talk about Makoto's rambunctious older sister Akane, or their feline familiar's Chito and Kenny, but we'd be here all day. \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: Characters - 10 outta 10.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have to talk about the art. This is one of the most beautiful shows I've seen recently, and that's coming from someone who is constantly on the prowl for shows with amazing art. The backgrounds and still-shots are impeccable. From flowing rivers with cherry blossoms overhead, to detailed close-ups of plants and vegetables, Flying Witch has some astonishingly great visuals.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the art and animation beautiful, but the designs of creatures and characters from the magic world are a sight to behold. There are some wondrously imaginative designs throughout this show. While I did sometimes get a Ghibli-esque feeling of astonishment as the various magical beings appeared on screen, my appreciation for these uniquely designed creatures was more comparable to something from Dark Souls or Bloodborne, games I highly value for their artistic direction and whimsical designs. The Harbinger of Spring's arrival in episode 2, and the Curtain of Night visiting the cafe in episode 8 both gave me that eerily creepy, yet beautiful feeling I get from Dark Souls enemies. Through and through, Flying Witch did not disappoint in the visual department.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are also filled with vibrant colors and breathtaking landscapes. They're both surprisingly catchy too. The soundtrack is the sweet little cherry on top of this wonderful sundae. It's very subtle, but adds tremendously to the mood of each scene.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no central plot or story to this show, but it really didn't need one. The lack of conflict made for a calm and relaxing ride the entire time. The small victories and natural progression is enough for the show to feel like its moving and that these characters are learning and experiencing new things.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is called Flying Witch, but Makoto doesn't even do that much flying, on screen anyways. The show moves forward at such a great pace, yet goes nowhere at all. We go along with Makoto each day on a new adventure, and though it doesn't seem like much, we do get to see, bit by bit, how she is coming to understand the world of magic surrounding her.\\n\\n\r\nWe see Makoto gently float into the air in the first episode, as the world of witches is revealed to Chinatsu for the first time. Makoto is still a novice with her broom, and we see her struggle with the way she uncomfortably rides it at first. But once episode 12 rolled by, and we drift with her over the peaceful city of Aomori, we see her riding her broom properly. There was no training montage, or countless escapades of Makoto clumsily falling off her broom. No, we see her naturally progress through the time she spent with the Kuramoto's, and as things come to a close, seeing Makoto ride her broom with such ease bears the fruits of her growth to us.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say it enough how much this show surprised me. I went in with zero expectations and left with something I'll hold as a magical experience of my own. Flying Witch came and went like that spring courier, filled with bewildering mystery, just to drift away after we've only scratched the surface. There's so much beauty and history left to explore in the world of Flying Witch, and I hope there will be more of it to come in the future.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Flying Witch is a good series to illustrate the appeal of slice of life (SOL) in its purest form.  It is an iyashikei series, a healing anime that attempts to soothe the viewer. Although other series  could do this with some sort of conflict or story to cover, Flying Witch is Iyashikei at its simplest with little to no conflict. It sticks to the basics without adding anything new, but it executes itself well enough to be worthwhile. But before we can see what Flying Witch did right, we must first answer why series of this nature with no conflict can be interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many who claim that SOL is a completely pointless genre on its own and that it only works alongside other genres in the case of series such as Planetes or Ashita no Joe. These individuals claim that it would be far more interesting to live one's own life than watch a series about individuals living mundane lives. Although this is an understandable criticism, it  is partially misguided, for Slice of Life series in their purest form fulfill a role similar to fantasy series. Whereas fantasy series allow the individual to escape beyond the constraints of physical world, a slice of life iyashikei series allows an individual to escape the restrictions that prevent paying attention to the simpler details in life.  Attempting to do so in the real world would often result in senseless thoughts that get in the way. It can be far more difficult to appreciate nature in the real world when one is spinning with thoughts and concerns, but within a piece of media, it is far easier to become absorbed in the experience.\\n\\n\r\nEven with this realization, the pertinent question is \"how could watching such mundane events be interesting?\" The answer lies all in attention. As the writer  Henry Miller suggested, \u201cThe moment one gives close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself.\" From this, we can gather that whether or not these mundane tasks are interesting depend on how well the particular series captures our attention. In the case of Flying Witch, it does so with the simplest trick in the Iyashikei book: atmosphere. Through the use of its artstyle and soundtrack, it immerses the viewer to the point that the viewer can find enjoyment in the simple tasks that he or she knows is relevant but is nonetheless difficult to appreciate in the real world. Tasks such as gardening and cooking are ones that Flying Witch tackles while (hopefully)  retaining the vewer's interest through its atmosphere.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, in addition to atmosphere, this type of show needs solid character interactions. Although none of the characters in Flying Witch are anything profound or special, they work well with each other. The cast consists of an airhead protagonist (Makoto), a spontaneous young girl (Chinatsu), a laid-back supporting male (Kei), and the MC's troublesome but knowledgable sister (Akane). Although the characters rarely surprise you with their personality, the ways in which they react with each other provide engagement. Akane's playfullness coupled with Makoto's cluelessness enables entertaining antics when the former is teaching the latter magic. Chinatsu's childlike and organic reactions to every situation are the most potent in the entire series, and Kei's reserved nature helps ground every event into a state of peace rather than conflict. The characters may be accused of being too bland or lacking in character, but this is not to say that the characters are necessarily unrealistic. Flying Witch never takes us within the psychologies of the characters, only relying on showing the outside. Externally, it mirrors the types of situations and reactions individuals would have in real life. For this reason, there is some element of realism despite the lack of depth, as individuals in the real world when examined from the outside (just as Flying Witch does) seem simpler than they really are. One may argue that the lack of conflict that occurs in the series is forced given that it would make sense for at least some of it, but in several mundane situations within the real world, conflict does not always occur. Speaking anecdotally, I can excuse this lack of conflict for in my own life, there could be weeks or months in which I have little to no conflict among any of my interactions. \\n\\n\r\nThis blandness may seem dull, but as the series attempts to portray the mundane nature of life, it works for the series. The dialogue and gestures throughout the series seem natural and organic, which is definitely needed in a series like this one. Flying Witch also bases a fair bit of its settings on real life, enabling those settings to feel far more realistic. As a series that embraces the simplicity of life, this is certainly a positive. Even the fact that the magic used within the series is unimpressive and rarely flashly aids with this anime's goal. By utilizing bland magic, it better juxtaposes the mundane with the magical, a theme inherent in almost all of Iyashikei. \\n\\n\r\nPertaining to the story itself, it is easy to guess by now that Flying Witch doesn't focus on many particularly interesting events. Rather than bouts of spectacle, there's an episode dedicated to a witches' restaurant and half an episode dedicated to thinning flowers from an apple tree. The content of the series is primarily episodic, but there are slight hints of continuity throughout the episodes. The episodes themselves aren't that repetitive in what they set out to do, but they don't really accomplish much on their own. It's all dependant on how well those episodes were able to engage the viewer by their content.\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch does have some idealization. For example, witches are never portrayed negatively, which contrasts with how they are perceived in reality.Sure, this is a small detail, but for a series that aims to ground itself a fair bit in reality, this can hinder the Suspension of Disbelief. Although a lot of conflict isn't needed in this type of show, it does feel idealized for having next to none at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest hindrance of Flying Witch is that it doesn't accomplish that much from a writing standpoint. It's basic in what it does, and though it does a good job, what it tries to do isn't anything particularly difficult to write. Those who value light-hearted entertainment will likely view this show more highly than those who focus more on writing and a story.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: (Personal Calssification\u2014Decent)\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch was a fairly entertaining watch. It's a soothing series that does what it is supposed to do. The animation, sountrack, character interactions, and attention to a detailed setting all work to enhance the experience.  \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend watching at least the first two episodes before deciding to continue or drop it. Flying Witch isn't a series for everyone, as there will still be many unconvinced by Iyashikei series as a whole, but for those who don't mind a soothing, heartwarming series without much of a story, Flying Witch is a great watch.",

            "content": "In the past, I've had a lot of good experiences with anime about witches. Kiki's Delivery Service, Shuumatsu no Izetta & El Cazador de la Bruja were all great or better. This time around, we're looking at Flying Witch. This one is based off of a manga by Ishizuka Chihiro wth the anime being handled by JC Staff. Yes, the same studio as Final Fantasy: Unlimited, Azumanga Daioh, Honey and Clover, & Potemayo. We've looked at their works a lot and with widely varying degrees of quality. Let's see where this one falls.\r\nStory:\r\nWe open with our heroine, Makoto, moving in with some relatives so thatshe can finish High school and be semi-independent like a good witch. From there we basically follow her as she spends time with friends & relatives while meeting supernatural beings and doing witch things. Basically, it's a slice of life with the twist being that it's about a witch.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really have any issues with the series in terms of narrative. Yeah, the story is very minimal with the various episodes all focusing on different slice of life situations that may not be connected to one another, but that's not really a problem. There are plenty of slice of life series like that and this one uses that format very well.\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch is very firmly an iyashikei series. If you aren't familiar with the term, it basically refers to an anime or manga that's designed around soothing the audience and making them feel good. The main tool it employs to gain this effect is making the supernatural elements highly comforting and whimsical. Whether it's a harbinger who just wants to say hello, an anthropomorphic witch who's really friendly and adorable, a shy ghost who just wants to serve tasty pastries or some other such thing, they're all designed around instilling a sense of delight. And because the supernatural elements are so integral to making the series enjoyable, they never seem gimmicky or pointless even though what they're being used for equates to faffing about. I also appreciate the way it takes the piss out of certain tropes like the \u201cmagical being who's supposed to be keeping their abilities a secret but everyone knows anyway.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWhen you have a light, fluffy series one of the things you absolutely need to go with it are endearing characters. Fortunately, that's another element that Flying Witch absolutely nails. The characters have eccentricities, but they aren't heavily exaggerated like they are in some comedies. Which makes them entertaining and fun while also preventing them getting overbearing. It also manages to have a child character who acts like a child, isn't annoying and is actually really charming. Which is not easy to do. And this is coming from someone who doesn't care for children in general. The characters also possess enough verisimilitude that they feel, largely, like real people. The only way they really stretch believability is that they're too good natured and you don't encounter many people with that level of goodness. Much less an entire world where it's everybody. But I can't complain about that since it's part of what makes it excel as an iyashikei series.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch has, I must say, superb artwork. It's not just that the backgrounds and character designs are really well done, although that helps. It's the entire supernatural aesthetic. The creatures they encounter are creative and interesting looking. The whale in particular stands out but there are a lot of other examples. The magic isn't flashy, but the more subdued use of it does work better for the relaxing atmosphere. So, good decision there.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe performances in this are really good. And, for most of the main actors, this is my first time hearing them give really strong performances. Shinoda Minami, Suzuki Eri, Sugawara Shinsuke & Aoi Kana included. I've heard Mikami Shiori and some of the minor characters in good anime before this one but most of the main cast don't have many credits which makes their performances all the more impressive. Dewa Yoshiaki's soundtrack complements the soothing atmosphere perfectly. I'll give him full credit on that one.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a bit. Inukai and Akane interact as though they're one confession away from ripping each other's clothes off and just going at it. Akane even describes Inukai as being too cute. There are also some interactions betwixt Makoto and Nao that make it seem like Makoto has more than a little crush.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something whimsical and endearing that'll soothe you, Flying Witch fits the bill damn near perfectly. If, on the other hand, you want something with an involved narrative and a lot of conflict, it's not going to be that. Ultimately, I really enjoyed watching it and would go so far as to say it's among the best iyashikei works I've seen. My final rating is going to be a 9/10. Next week, Dragoon.",

            "content": "Flying witch is a laid back slice of life anime with one of the most charming characters i've ever seen. It follows the story of Kowata Makoto who's a witch in training. All of the episodes cover the everyday life of this girl and her family and friends.\r\nWhat i like about Flying Witch in general is how relaxing it is. Now it is just a typical slice of life anime at first glance but each episode you start to enjoy it more and more until you can't get enough. \r\nWhat makes this a masterpiece is the combination of charming characters, gorgeous art, and over thetop calming music. All of these just compliment each other so well.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this point on there's some really minor spoilers so keep in mind. REALLY minor.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] (This part have some minor spoilers, you can skip this.)\\n\r\nEven though there's really not much into the story in Flying Witch, or slice of life anime in general. But Flying Witch just makes the simplest and boring stuff interesting. What i noticed while watching Flying Witch is how this anime has ZERO drama. There's absolutely no drama, everyone's so chill all the time. There were plots where i thought there would be some drama but no they just play it off and it turned into a funny scene and i laughed my ass off. By the way, yeah this anime is really funny. Found myself can't stop laughing at times.\\n\\n\r\n[Art]\\n\r\nThe art is well typical J.C Studio style, of course with it's own characteristics for Flying Witch. What makes this special is just how beautiful it is. Especially the green scenery and everything. Deserve a solid 9.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]\\n\r\nNow the music in this anime is just extremely calming and just gives off that country side feel, kind of like harvest moon/stardew valley (game) vibe. They fit in the anime so well. This whole anime reminds me of stardew valley, how they pick up wild plants in the side of the street and cooks them, just like in the game. Anyway i'm sidetracking, the music gets a 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\r\nThe characters can be described as a few words: Charming, happy, cheerful, silly, funny, chill,cute and more. They are absolutely no antagonist in the anime. Don't forget about the familiars in the anime, they are characters too. My favorite is Chito the black cat. SO CUTE. The facial expression in this anime are hilarious af.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\r\n Definitely was not bored while watching any of the episodes. They 20 mins episode felt like 5 mins, they went by so quick. Really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\r\nThis was one of the best slice of life anime's i've watched. Of course it's not for everyone, maybe someone find it boring or uninteresting but it's definitely good for me. If you find it boring the first few episodes, don't stop watching. You'll fall in love later. Might even get a S2 since there's still manga material to be covered.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it from me, this is just my opinion, if yours is different well no problemo. Have a good one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVTK_rRZwu4",

            "content": "REVIEW: Flying Witch\r\n\"How is this rated a 7.69!? This is a great slice-of-life anime. In my opinion. Why? Well, read my review and you'll see why!\r\nStory: (8/10) Here's my take on the synopsis. Makoto, being the witch she is, the story practically revolves around her alongside her cousins, Kei and Chinatsu. With the start of each episode, as a witch in training, Makoto explores Aomori, Japan with her two cousins to expand her surroundings. By exploring together, the crew encounters many things. May it be companions, magical beings, creatures and places unperceivable from the human eye! With the help of her surroundings and as awitch living with her two cousins in Aomori, Japan, her goal is to become a 'Flying Witch' someday!\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10) The animation is fluid, and simply beautiful since this anime is made by the one and only and as expected J.C. Staff! The creators who made Toradora!, Kaichou wa-maid Sama! and many other notable anime! There's nothing more great you can get from them (well, there are a few exceptions), but can expect great art from this anime!\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10): The music is one of it's strong points. Because, two words. It's. Relaxing. And. Soothing. That's five, nevermind. But anyways, for those who have watched Gin no Saji, the singer   'miwa' sings both the first opening of Gin no Saji and for the opening of this anime as well! I can appreciate that the opening, ending, and let's not forget the soundtrack matched the tone and quality of this anime! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s) (8/10): You may think the characters are dull, boring, and are lacking of variety through the first two episodes. But, the characters are as well one of its strong points. The reason why it's one of it's strong points because it strays away from all the other anime cliques we're all tired seeing of. Don't expect any dere(s), loli(s), shota(s) and etc. But do expect some quite interesting magical beings as well as adorable little creatures! As each and every character have a fun, original, unique personality to them! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): By watching the first two episodes, my first impression of this anime was 'indifferent'. I thought it would be some other anime slice-of-life cliche. As the third episode strolled along however, I found newfound respect for this anime. The fun adventures they have together, things they find that are unperceivable from the human eye, make me want to be part of their adventures! A fantasy you'd want to indulged in. As that being the case, I can quite say that I'd enjoyed this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10): Along with Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge, this anime stands as one of the best anime to watch of the Spring season. Each and every episode was filled with intriguing stories, I must say, to watch! I can say that the characters even though they were simple, were unique in a way! Art was presented greatly as expected from the J.C. Staff. Sound absolutely was relaxing and soothing at the most part! Most importantly I enjoyed this anime from beginning to end! If you want a relaxing and soothing anime to watch after watching a 'stressful' anime, I definitely recommend this one! Expect yourself to smile and chuckle at each and ever episode! \\n\\n\r\n- I want a season two! \\n\\n\r\nRAW:\\n\\n\r\n8.79/10.00\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\n9.00/10.00",

            "content": "I'm glad that I watched this. I can't recall exactly the shows, But I've had some shows that kind of feel the same or are alike and they're just not that great.\r\nThe Slice of Life and Magic is a nice pair up in this. It's honestly nice and calming with no threat about anything. It honestly baffles me that I never once found myself bored with this show. Normally, These shows can barely hold my attention for long.\r\nI do find it kind of disappointing that there is little in the ways of magic happening.  We see very little of anything happening. I do alsowish that Makoto ( MC ) Was smarter in the knowledge of magic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the best.\\n\\n\r\n-Chinatsu Is a surprisingly adorable girl that I don't find annoying. Normally I can't stand kids with most of them being boy characters. Girls tend to be less annoying but still are usually badly done.\\n\\n\r\n-Makoto's is a pretty awesome MC. She is an always adorable girl and can be very naive about things that just makes her all the more entertaining. I really like both Makoto and Nao. They are pretty good friends together and I love how Nao is always trying to keep up with Makato.  Even though there isn't romance. I did notice some slight Yuri cues, I don't know if it was intentional. But both Nao and Makoto would make a perfect ship.\\n\\n\r\n-Nao is fun to have on the screen whenever she's on tv. The only issue is that we barely see her. I like her design and is my 2nd or 3rd favorite of the show. Again, The friendship between both her and Makoto is pretty good. I would ship them if this was the type of show.\\n\\n\r\n-Akane is a pretty good tomboyish character that I like. I'd say her design is up there fighting for my favorite character design of the show. I'd say she is my 2nd or 1st favorite. I like both Nao's and Makoto's friendship a good amount. But I'd defiantly say I adore the friendship between Akane and Inukai. With Akane always causing trouble for Inukai and Inukai and Akane seems to be more natural friends. I of course ship the both of them and feel that in the actual show, That there is some actual Yuri tension between them.\\n\\n\r\n-Inukai I like. It's kind of interesting how due to her mistake, She is for the foreseeable stuck in a Beastkin type form of a Dog ( She looks more like a fox to me) It's kind of an adorable design. Just like I said to Akane description, The friendship is my favorite. I also obviously ship the two of them.\\n\\n\r\nI love this show and hope we get more in the future. I'm not putting my hopes on it. But I do like this show a lot.",

            "content": "Spoiler free.\r\nFlying Witch...where i have to begin?\r\nFan of the \"usual magic\" anime series should think twice before watching this work, because it has almost nothing to do with the common magic that we are used to see. It has magic, that's sure, but it's different, more classic and, in some ways, more deep.\r\nStory: 6\r\nWhy only 6? Because that series doesn't have a story, and doesn't need it, in my humble opinion.\r\nThe events of the various episodes are well managed, so the time will flow easily while watching.\r\nArt: 7\r\nWhat can i say...the \"visual\" part of the anime is not memorable, but it fits perfectly the paceand the atmosphere of the series, and for me that's the most important thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nNice voice acting and pretty op/ed. The main dish, though, is the OST; it harmonize with sceneries, moods and situations, giving a push on the emotions that the spectator feels.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nI have to say it, as the story doesn't exist, even the characters aren't so original or deep, or have some sort of development trough the series...but they work, and the work pretty well.\\n\r\nWith so many anime out there i think that's nearly absurd to pretend originality everywhere, so i don't give much weight to that point in my evaluation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis series was a fresh wind that have traveled trough seasons, bringing along the scent of everything that has encountered, and the results it's something great.\\n\r\nIt's a slice of life, the comedy part is not so funny, the \"witch magic\" appears maybe one time for episode, but the real magic is everywhere. If I have to analize every single element the rate will not be so high, but the show have a strange sort of alchemy that it was able to put all the parts in a pot, cook them at low fire and take out the best from all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 well deserved!",

            "content": "Flying Witch is possibly one of the most relaxed, tranquil anime bestowed upon this world. This show was a gem among stones this season, with nothing else keeping me particularly hyped for the next episode. Despite this show having a basic plot and absolutely no movement in the story (not physically anyway) this was absolutely one of my favourites this season.\r\nStory: 8\r\nFlying Witch is about, well, a flying witch. Her name is Kowata Makoto, she leaves the city of Yokohama to live with her relatives in the small town of Aomori to train as a witch. That's about it, each episode depicts the antics allthe characters get up to together, from simple activities like cooking at school or making a vegetable patch, to creating potions and discovering new spells accompanied by the other witch characters, Akane (Makoto's sister) and Inukai (Akane's friend). These activities were enjoyable to watch, there was no flashy spell-casting or explosions or intensity, just relaxing and calming to watch. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe setting of Aomori is absolutely beautiful, lush landscapes and aerial shots of the town and surrounding environment are frequently shown and used effectively to transition scenes and display the location of our characters next \"everyday\" event. The characters looked fairly stock-standard, you've seen this style before, but it is nice to look at, they look like normal people. I think that's another reason this show feels so relaxing to watch, the characters don't look like they're out to fight evil or blow shit up, they lead normal lives and do normal stuff, simple and effective.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nWhile the OP of Flying Witch is questionable at times, personally I enjoyed it sometimes, didn't really at others. The ED was beautiful, really nice way to tie off each episode, especially as sometimes I didn't even feel it coming, and assumed it was part of the episode. On the topic of that, the soundtrack was incredible, so god damn tranquil. The quiet sounds of the mornings accompanied by soothing acoustic guitar sets each episode off with a fresh and warm feeling. The SFX used in comedic scenes also works perfectly, with a wonky, quirky tone to it that, in my opinion, emphasizes the scenes dialogue or topic effectively.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nYou've seen all these characters before, they are quite easy to predict and you can guess their next personality trait in an instant. But, this doesn't mean they don't keep the show going, Makoto is gorgeously bubbly and excited by such simple things you can't help but gush, Akane receives the label of crazy, adventurous, show-offy alcoholic big sister, but still adds important input to the dialogue and her storytelling adds an entire new level to the world that the show is set in. Kei and Chinatsu are both great characters, Kei being the understanding, kind and welcoming male lead, always willing to spark the events of the episode, and teach both the other characters and the viewer (well, me at the least) new things about the particular activity being done. Chinatsu is cute as fuck, and her excitement and open-mindedness makes every scene a happy one, her charm and bubbly personality surpass Makoto, and her clueless-ness at some points has a very distinct curiousity to it, pulling the viewer in and forming a surrogacy of inquisition.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show very much, I enjoyed watching these simple characters interact and grow deeper bonds with each other as they performed everyday tasks and just simply had innocent fun together. That's really all there is to it, this show has such a simple formula and executes it perfectly. Making such simple activities interesting to watch and difficult to stop.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nBasically if you've got a cup of tea or something in your hands, lying in bed, or on the couch, relaxed in the early morning and you watch this, you've pretty much got no excuse not to feel spectacularly tranquil and enlightened. If your looking for something light-hearted and easy to watch, I encourage you to watch Flying Witch. \\n\\n\r\n~Xeno156",

            "content": "Sometimes you just wanna sit and relax watching some traquil animes, without the exagerations, explosive fights, over-the-top romance and all the other traits that most animes have, if you want a fun light slice of life anime, with characters that act (most of the time) like a tipycal anime character, you've found it!\r\n Flying witch is, basically, another  slice of life anme, but, on top of that, it has witchcraft... sometimes. It's fun and if you like slice of life, you'll probably like this anime a lot, i did.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\n [NO spoilers] The story of this anime is not very deep, it worksmostly as a background, the anime presents to you that, in this world, there are some witches and they do some witch stuff. They don't show much of that, in all the anime there's, probably, 6 spells, and most of thame they just... fly in brooms. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, the anime choose to focus on the life of Makoto, a (surprisingly) 15 years old [she looks like 20 lol] that lives a peaceful life on a town in a kinda rural (not really rural side, but it looks like it is sometimes) town. The story then progress showing the life of makoto and her friends there, not escaping much of this theme. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\n  Cool, it's not surprisingly good, but it's good. There are some scenes where they fly that are really good, that's it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\n  Eh, the op is cool, but the rest of it is just... generic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\n  You know them, they're in all animes you've watched. The characters are just... normal, makoto is fun and i like her a lot, but the best character is her cat. Overall, the cast is not complex, but they have memorable traits, althought they don't act mostly like a real person, it's just what you expect, but you can feel that they work fine in the context of the anime. There are some characters with cool concepts that appears just once, and some don't even say anything, but gives kinda of a veracity to the world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\n  This anime is F U N, you cant just sit, relax, and be entertained by it, they always keeps the anime fresh with some others things to the characters to do and, when you noticed, the day is over and you watched all the episodes without leaving your room.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\n  There's nothing left to say about it. It's a slice of life, a relaxing and fun anime. If you like relaxing anime like yuru camp, Non Non Biyori, Usagi drop, barakamon, gin no saji, etc. you will definitely like it, it has no real conflit (like, for example, barakamon) but nonetheless still a good time.",

            "content": "If you're looking for an 'iyashikei' (healing) anime, this is definitely a good choice - no drama, all fun, and you feel refreshed once watching it. \r\nThe Story - As the show is a slice of life anime, the episodes aren't very story driven; episodes don't lead on from one to another, meaning there's a fresh new story each time you watch. The magic element really sets this show apart though - there's no war going on, the protagonist isn't on some long-winded quest or anything. Instead, it's about a young girl and her training as a witch. Simple, but it works.\r\nThe Art - Watchingthe show has a sort of calming effect; there's no flashy colours or effects. You're instead given a beautifully gentle looking show that really matches the anime's atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound - The OP and ED are both cute and match the tone of the show pretty well, much like the background music. Whilst the tracks aren't memorable, they add to the calming effect of the show, and help to immerse you into Makoto's world.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters - Every single character has their own unique charms and quirks. Makoto's kind yet eccentric personality, Chinatsu's random one liners, and even Kei's subdued personality really make the show what it is. Akane will always keep you coming back as well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Flying Witch was one of those shows that I underestimated; I didn't really pay that much attention when I watched the first few episodes, but when I restarted it, I realised when a gem it was. Funny, calming, and a show that I think anyone could enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Flying Witch gets an 8/10. A charming show, with it's characters being the backbone to it's charm. I'd recommend this show to anyone; anime fan or not.",

            "content": "Flying Witch is a fantastic series and breaks the norm from the supernatural series of the past and present.\r\nAs I will say every time, I love any series that is set in a rural area. Something about it enables me to relax and take in a show with little to no effort while still enjoying it. What's more is we get witches and the like added to the mix. Normally, when it comes to having this element in a series, it mostly involves shounen battle sequences, good versus evil and whatnot. Here, we just have witches (the rest mostly being spirits of nature) living amongsthumans with no conflict. Rarely do we see this ever happen, and I'm glad a series like this exists.\\n\\n\r\nWhat also makes this entertaining is the characters. They're all likable and have some good interactions with each other. From the timing of their dialogue to their amusing expressions, it's hard not to smile when you see these characters appear.\\n\\n\r\nI think what makes this a good series set in the \"countryside\" is how the animation depicts the scenery. So much detail is put into the houses and the nature that it looks realistic. Also, the character designs are very appealing and cute.\\n\\n\r\nDon't think that I dislike anything action-oriented or shows that are strictly shounen, far from it. It's just, you do see a lot of them with each season, and it can get a little tiresome. Which is why shows like Flying Witch allow me to take a breather. It's a nice change of pace; it's meant to be relaxing where you can easily take in everything.",

            "content": "Flying Witch is possibly the best iyashikei (healing) anime ever made. If you love Aria, Non Non Biyori, and the Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou OVAs, then this is a must-see series. Flying Witch stands out because it makes even Aria look action-packed. Every moment of every episode unfolds naturally and organically; there's a very subtle but unmistakable message that humans (witch or otherwise) are truly inseparable from the earth, plants, wind, and sky. There's no overt conflict, no overly energetic comedy bits, and really no plot. I have no idea how an entire episode dedicated to the coming of spring, taking a few walks, and pickingfresh wildflower buds for tempura can be utterly captivating, but that's why Flying Witch is so magical.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that's particularly refreshing is that all the characters, even ones from the magical world, are portrayed in a very realistic manner. Instead of relying on eccentric behavior to drive the story, the show just lets people be themselves. This is particularly important for the character of Chinatsu, a grade-school girl who's the younger cousin of Makoto (the titular witch of the series). It's great to see her reactions because she doesn't act like any of the anime tropes you might expect to encounter, nor is she given any odd quirks to make her more of a stand-out (e.g. Renge from Non Non Biyori). Chinatsu's just a normal kid, and that alone makes her a rare and wonderful creation. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, Chito, Makoto\u2019s cat and familiar, actually acts and is animated like a real cat. Chito can be lazy, likes taunting the neighborhood dog, and goes on inscrutable adventures that only another cat could truly understand. I\u2019ve followed a few cats on their adventures in my time and Chito is exactly like those real world felines. There\u2019s a wonderful moment in Episode 5 when Chito decides to take a nap with Chinatsu, and the animators take the time to depict Chito circling around a few times before finally settling down. This is exactly what every cat ever actually does, and this show has the generosity to let Chito be true to Chito. All anime cats should be so lucky.\\n\\n\r\nGenerosity is perhaps the best word to describe Flying Witch. One can\u2019t help but notice the small kindnesses that every episode contains. Whether it\u2019s helping out with simple household chores, ensuring that a caterpillar finds a safe spot to feed on fresh leaves, or keeping a new friend company while she runs errands, one is constantly reminded of how these tiny actions are often so much more meaningful than the occasional grand gesture. \\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch is a moment of utter serenity in the frenetic world of anime, and its real magic is in giving its viewers the chance to reflect on the smallest moments in daily life and realize that those can be the most enchanting of all. Flying Witch shows that a butterfly\u2026or a caterpillar\u2026is as beautiful and moving as a cathedral.",

Perhaps you want to relieve yourself of all the worries in real life and just enjoy the ride?\r\nRegardless, I invite you to enter the world of Flying Witch. It is not heavy, exciting, or full of action. In fact, it meanders through quite uneventful situations. However, it is truly the pinnacle of slice of life as far as feeling good goes. It's a beautiful concoction of peaceful music, a laid-back setting, and genuinely sweet characters doing everyday things with noworry or tension and magic thrown in. While more demanding audiences may find it dull, I can safely recommend it those who just want something sweet and soothing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other relaxing shows out there, like Non Non Biyori, K-On!, and the Suzumiya Haruhi Series to name a few, but not very many of them can create such a perfectly built universe that seems separate and devoid of anime clich\u00e9s and stereotypes. It is merely a tale of a girl named Makoto visiting her family in the outskirts with her cat. However, their daily activities aren't very ordinary. In fact, they regularly involve magic. Think of it like Aria or Yokohama Shopping Log with fantasy flavor. Makoto herself is a witch and their everyday events include anything from planting a mandrake to helping a friend turn back into a human from a furry to visiting a Ghibli-esque caf\u00e9 with regular customers that include ladybugs, foxes, and invisible people. The magical elements blend in so seamlessly, it's as if they're natural. It adds a level of extra beauty to an otherwise run of the mill story.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters are very memorable. They all have stunning chemistry together and their conversations flow with ease. Each of them also have many personality traits that adds a level of familiarity that most SoL anime don't have. While I was watching it, I didn't feel like I was just watching characters talking with each other. I felt like they were genuine people that I knew closely. Don't expect them to be well-developed or complex though.\\n\\n\r\nNow I come to the big issue - Unfortunately, not everyone will appreciate Flying Witch. Regardless of how cute and cuddly it is, a large portion of the audience will find it boring. There is no overall plot, no drama, no conflict, no character development, and no degree of complexity. Those who want something exciting, thrilling or deep won't get what they're looking for. I had to be in an undemanding mood to enjoy it to the fullest, so I found myself bored while watching it some days.\\n\\n\r\nThe production was done by the masters of slice of life themselves, J.C.Staff. Like all their shows, the animation is rather standard. It doesn't look choppy or ugly but certainly doesn't boast anything special. The designs are very typical but don't stick out as terrible or anything. I can say the visuals fit the calm style of the narrative but only that much.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, it does a good job of being soothing and restful but like the visuals, it's not fantastic. Most of the soundtrack is composed of calm piano and flute pieces, as well as some stringed music. None of the tracks in particular are very memorable but as a whole, it does its job. The opening, on the other hand, can be described in one word - Cute. With the adorable dance routine, upbeat song, and colorful visuals, you can't help but feel warm inside after watching it. It does a very good job of preparing for what's to come. There is also something special about the voice acting. Quite simply, the VAs sound genuine. None of them deliver squeaky or overly obnoxious roles (unlike a good portion of slice of life), so it sounds very nice.\\n\\n\r\nSo, sit back, relax, drink a cup of tea, sit on your couch, and enjoy the ride. Are you having a bad day? It will be a great remedy for that. In the end, what you have is definitely a basic slice of life type of show - but one of the best ones out there. Even if you're a cold-hearted bastard and spawn of Cthulu, you should still get something out of it.",

            "content": "Flying Witch, a show that pretty much speaks for itself judging by the title. Yes, it\u2019s literally a series about a flying witch named Makoto and her friends. Yes, it has magic in the series because what else would witches excel in? And yes, this is the type of magical story that will entice you in such a comfortable charm that you won\u2019t ever forget.\r\nThe series is adapted from the manga of the same name and essentially, it\u2019s a hybrid of slice of life and fantasy. We follow the life of Kowata Makoto as she returns to living in a rural town with her friendsand relatives. In essence, it explores the daily life style of how Makoto gets around while also developing her magical skills as the flying witch. Her friends and family guides her while we also learn about their characters. There is no linear storytelling as each episode seems to be an episodic adventure of itself. However, that\u2019s what actually makes Flying Witch so special because just how unique the show can be as we see its imaginativity.\\n\\n\r\nA good deal of the enjoyment about the series comes from the characters. It\u2019s a small yet diverse and unique cast because every character has their own attributes and characteristics. Makoto is the polite type of girl with a down to earth type of personality yet also has a problem of getting lost. Throughout the series, this humorous gag is played as we see how clueless she can be with directions. Then, there\u2019s Chinatsu Kuramoto (Makoto\u2019s cousin). As a younger character, it comes to no surprise that she is curious about the world around her and the people she meets. Furthermore, she has a peculiar interest in magic after seeing it with her very own eyes. It\u2019s also interesting to note that Chinatsu gets a decent amount of development as she experiences with magic as well. Akane Kowata is the witch of the series, literally. She is not just the older sister of Makoto but also acts as her mentor figure as well. However, unlike Makoto, Akane is more of an airhead and often speaks what\u2019s on her mind no matter how brutally honest it is. Despite that, she deeply cares about her family and we can see that she has a gentle heart. From Chinatsu\u2019s family side, we also have Kei Kuramoto who serves more of the older brother type. Although by personality, I find that he is more similar to Akane with his down to earth personality. It\u2019s these characters that gets a good deal of emphasis and each episode explores their relationship in the story. And to be quite honest, it\u2019s quite special.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, you\u2019re probably asking yourself: what should I really expect from Flying Witch? Do we just get to see a typical slice of life/fantasy story that we may or may not like? While the pacing of the series may feel sluggish, it\u2019s the atmospheric feel and ways to embrace the fantasy genre that really can win fans over. Throughout the show, there\u2019s all type of supernatural gags that makes their appearances ranging from sonic screeching mandrakes, flying whales, mysterious ghosts, and even anthropomorphic characters that can transform into a dog. Familiars such as cats and hamsters are also no stranger in this series either. The point is that the series wants the viewers to experience what it has to offer by bringing all sorts of content to the table. It succeeds in this by bringing a sense of magical realism by combining elements of supernatural with daily life experiences. \\n\\n\r\nFrom a story perspective, the series can stray some viewers from pursuing further into the series as at times, the pacing can feel uninteresting. If you\u2019re dying for some magical action, then you\u2019re looking at wrong place. This isn\u2019t some series about witches trying to take over the world. In fact, Flying Witch emphasizes a lot about its premise and themes rather than story development. I confess to myself that the series is perhaps one of the most charming shows I\u2019ve watched in recent years. Just for the fact that each episode, there\u2019s the graceful feeling the series brings in with its character and setting. Even the comedy, which I wasn\u2019t sold on at first, convinced me that the series is a rare gem. It\u2019s down to earth humor that is very consistent about what it tries to do. In the meantime, I\u2019m also satisfied with the directing of the series despite that it follows more of a rearranged adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff helms the series and it\u2019s quite an elegant feeling you\u2019ll see with its artwork. Characters look simple yet makes you wonder what to expect about them. There\u2019s a refreshing feel whenever you see characters like Makoto on a broomstick or Chinatsu with witch aesthetics on. The familiars are also convincing that blurs the line between magical realism. Even the setting of a rural town is crafted quite well with a countryside feel that is nostalgic.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and music plays an important part of the series as it brings the atmospheric feeling to life. The overall tone of the show has a gentle tone and is wonderfully put together with its soft instruments. Both the OP and ED theme songs are also lighthearted and reminds us how charming the series can be. Furthermore, I have to give praise for the overall voice mannerism of the series as they sound exactly as their personalities is reflected.\\n\\n\r\nAh Flying Witch. Dubbed by some fans as \u201cComfy\u201d, it\u2019s definitely a show that is recommendable to just about anyone. From the unique cast of characters to magical realism, it\u2019s a series that takes slice of life and fantasy to a creative level. What you expect is what you will get. And that is, a show about flying witches, familiars, and giving you a comfy time. \\n",

            "content": "The title \"Flying witch\" suggests there will be flying and magics. I think both happen maybe once in each episode and that's it. But it's not a bad thing, it's just regular 'slice of life' anime.\r\nStory follows young witch Makoto living with her relatives in some nice countryside. The vibe really reminds me of \"Non non biyori\" - almost no people in the background, just main characters doing everyday things. Well, sometimes 'everyday things for a witch', but it's not flashy fireworks show. I really liked that, the magic rituals shown are simple - no lights, no wind, mainly drawing magic circles, using small itemsand awaiting effect. Flying on a broom is a way to travel around town, no racing or great speeds, just floating short distances.\\n\\n\r\nYou've seen these characters before - 7/10\\n\r\nUnfortunately nothing great in terms of characters, but they work nicely in this enviroment.\\n\\n\r\nSome nice ideas - 9/10\\n\r\nThe witches are among us, and so are some interesting ideas about how they live, and what other magical things there are in the world.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening is great, you will clap along in no time. Soundtrack not so much unfortunately, but it provides the relaxing atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou - 7/10\\n\r\nNothing special in terms of story, but I enjoyed short episodes from life of a witch. Familiar situations with just a little bit more magic.\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Witch - 10/10\\n\r\nFor me that was really more of a simple life in the countryside, relaxing atmosphere and no real problems.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for something peaceful to watch this season.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Take it easy, relax, and join in the fun. Flying witch's is perhaps one of the best titles to get snuggle up and \"comfy\" with.\r\nFlying witch was indeed a \"comfy\" title. Without a doubt \"comfy\" is the best word to describe the series. Flying Witch is a fantasy title that follows the 15-year-old witch Makoto Kowata and other supporting characters in her daily life.  Because the show is considered \"Slice of Life\" the story and plot are slow. The  slow pacing of the story-telling is actually a good thing, it makes it easy to follow along, and in addition to that, you canenjoy what the story has to offer, which is one of the many things I appreciated about this title. What's fascinating about Flying witch is that the show has a distinct Studio Ghibli feel to it. Ghibli films were always full of imaginative worlds, full of wonder and exploration. More than likely you will read this in many other reviews, with that out the way, let's continue. Flying witch is the \"ideal\" example  of a show with the following genres' \"supernatural\" and  \"slice of life\" done right.  The original author Chihiro Ishizuka must have had extensive knowledge and a lengthy amount of experience working on supernatural and slice of life titles. Because none of her work is listed anywhere, I'm going to assume that she has worked on various titles in the past and went unaccredited. If this is truly her first work then I must say that the way the anime was able to portray her work was very well done. The show offers quite a lot of lighthearted comedy which is backed up with little things like odd reaction faces (which I always found hilarious,) silly little jokes and gestures, that sort of thing. More than likely you won't be laughing your ass off to much. As for the lasting appeal the story has to offer, I feel like the show didn't really stand out that. This is perhaps due to the releases of bigger titles like Kabeneri of the Iron Fortess, Re:, and Boku no Hero Academia. When you read the Synopsis of Flying witch, in comparison to the mainstream titles listed above I'd say more viewers would watch those of witch. Last few things I'm going to add is that Flying witch's story, while not as deep as I expected, does in fact have moments that tug at the heart-strings at bit. It's so well part together that I may or may not have had tears in my eyes... \\n\\n\r\nFlying witch delivered visually spectacular animation! Settings, objects, all boated very high quality animation that was both frequently & heavily used during various scenes. The beauty of the background settings, water, trees, grass plains, the quality was beautiful! I could see that the animators added a few CGI objects & textures to add a sense of realism to certain things, again, like water, clouds, and ground objects etc. Seeing the reflection of objects in the water, the rough detail added in the stone,simply brilliant. Yasuhiro Okumura and Yoshio okouchi went all out, in details of the objects like wooden floors, tables etc.  Character designs were pretty amazing too. I loved the silly reaction faces the Characters would make. This coupled along with the moods shown on their faces . J.C.Staff really outdid themselves when it came to adding details and such to characters faces and body movement. Expressing the way a characters facial features, body movement, and emotions when they  would react to supernatural moments had a somewhat overly dramatic, yet was almost human-like. I do not doubt that J.C. Staff brought in real people (most likely workers there) and used Motion capture suits to add more realism in the already majestic & magical fantasy world that is Flying Witch. Perhaps the only thing that bothered me is the reflection spots on the characters noses, just that little odd spot. With very little doubt, I can say proudly that Flying Witch had \"the best\" animation I've seen so far this Spring season. Outstanding job done by J.C. Staff!\\n\\n\r\nI love the intro song, it really gets me excited to watch the show and singing & start clapping along with the song like a mentally disturbed man-child.  Every episode I would deliberately forget to skip the intro to sing along, as if I was a child watching Barney, or sesame street, or whatever children's programming is on now-a-days, damn if I know. The way that the intro song is performed reminds me of a late 90's and early 2000's catchy anime opening. To be more specific it kind of reminds me of Azumanga Daioh's intro, remember? Lu La lu La piano wa sekai no yumesaku nohara ni melody... Ready to sing along and then get right into the show and have a blast watching. The background music played in Flying witch was fantastic too. It's sort of like music played to fit with whatever is going on at the moment. That music really enhanced the quality of scenes full of magic, and certain parts in the show where the girls were taking part in some sort of adventure. Ghibli comes to mind again because as I mentioned earlier just about every song in a majority of the films has a beautiful and relaxing musical score that helps intesfies viewers expiernce while watching their films. Flying Witch shares that simular trait. Voice actors were perhaps my favorite thing in the sound department. Second favorite, because you know, the opening song is #1. I think that the voice actors did a magnificent job delivering their lines along with perfectly executing the over the top reaction lines/responses. Each character had their own distinctive, unique, &  charming qualities to them. This makes the show both friendly and appealing to whomever decides to watch it. It's actually rather difficult for me to add anything of usefulness to the characters because I feel like my character section would turn out to be very opinionated. So with that, Let me add that the cast is memorable, their interactions with each other is always fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot think of one thing I didn't enjoy about Flying witch. The comedy, jokes though light was often times funny and kept me going through the story. The plot  for different episodes always had something of interest and charm to deliver. Enough though I didn't feel like it had enough \"magic\" for a supernatural title, I was still impressed with everything that was presented in the end. I enjoyed getting time to discover new things with the main characters. Speaking of characters each of the main cast had  left me with good impressions of them. Expect for Kei.. he was boring as a character. Makoto, Akane Nao, MamaKuramoto and Chinatsu were the characters I enjoyed seeing the most in this series. Each of them had both fun and loving aspects to their own unique personalities which made the show all the more enjoyable for me. If I had to choose what was my favorite thing about flying witch was, I would probably say all of it. The show was so well written, displayed beautiful settings, and had the best music composed to complement that scenery. All of it, all of it put together made for a really amazing title! \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that stopped me from giving Flying Witch a 10/10 was that it lacks replay value. This is the type of title that I would probably own, but not open, nor watch. It would site in my Blu-Ray pile until I remembered that I bought it, despite loving it so much at the time. While most would consider this a polished diamond, I would consider it a hidden gem. It's only great if find it for yourselves that way you're not influenced by others (myself included) opinions about the show.  It makes the experiences of watching Flying Witch all the more valuable.  I had a really pleasant time watching this show  and I would highly recommend it to anyone who can handle slow-paced slice of life titles.",

Also the plot is all over the place for an anime with a slice of life genre, it may have a comedy genre, but it wasn't even funny, so poor Flying witch has landed a 3 over 10 on my score card.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise, it was a plain as any anime without an ecchi genre, so it's a 5 over 10, don't expect any panchira, onsen fanservice nor a swimsuit fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nSound, a  7 over 10 since the only consolation here was the opening theme, Sha, la,la, laaa.........it has that sweet feeling to it and it fits that main character as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, it's a 5 over 10 for this category, since the character themselves were plain and boring as they can be.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, since there isn't any scantly in this anime, it as decent as it can be, so 4 over 10..........\\n\\n\r\nBut overall , I'm giving it a 3 since you're more likely to wonder as to why would they even make an anime this boring, than enjoy the show.

            "content": "Flying Witch Review (NO SPOILERS)\r\nHeh. No spoilers. As if this show actually has anything to spoil, in the first place. Ok, then. Flying Witch is one of those shows that I see a screenshot or a short clip of and I think the artwork looks so stinkin good, that I just gotta go see the entire show. And unfortunately... that doesn't always lead me to the best of shows... If I were to describe Flying Witch in one word, it would be \"nothing\". That's the gist of it. NOTHING happens in this show. So you're thinking \"Oh, then it's a slice of life show?\" Iguess??? But it's the most eventless and dull lifestyle that you'll ever witness. Now, I said that there isn't anything to spoil in this show, and there really isn't. But I will be going over some events in the show, as well as the overall beginning set up, just so I can better describe things. Don't worry, though. I swear that you won't be getting spoiled on anything groundbreaking, no matter how much detail I give you.\\n\\n\r\nSo as the name of the show implies, this show stars a witch, named Makoto. Now you may be thinking \"Ok, a witch. So there's probably some cool magic and otherworldly events in this show, right?\" Nope... Well... there is, but it's almost entirely non existent. What I mean is that a lot of the magic in Flying witch is either done through reciting words, writing a spell or drawing a symbol, or through jump cuts that have NO flashy transition that even acknowledges that something magic even happened. For example, there's this cafe in the show, run by a witch. But the cafe looks like an abandoned, destroyed building. What they gotta do is a series of gestures, to make the cafe's true appearance show itself. You see them looking at the destroyed building, cut to their faces and bodies, doing the gestures, and then cut to the building being completely different. No transition. No sound effects. Nothing. Another thing is the flying. Makoto doesn't entirely know how to fly, at the beginning of the show. That gets mentioned around episode 4 or 5, or something like that. So you'd think we'd watch her trying to learn how to fly. But no. On the second to last episode or so, there's a scene that has Makoto flying on her broom. One of the characters mentions how well she's flying. And she just says \"Oh, ya. I finally mastered it.\" And that's it. It's never brought up, again. There's even a part where a non witch character starts training to become a witch. She asks for her parent's permission and they just say yes, with no hesitation. And then that's it. She never gets any magic powers throughout the show, but she's apparently now in training to become a witch. And that's the end of that.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're watching this show for its magic elements, don't. They're the most nonexistent non extravagant magic elements you ever see, or rather not see, in any anime ever. So how about the slice of life aspect of the show? Is that any good? Well... not really. It doesn't have any sort of plot, in any of the episodes. Not even any episodic ones, like Ouran Host Club or Fruits Basket. And it isn't funny in the slightest, like Azumanga Daioh. This show is all about existence. Just straight up existence, in the blandest way possible. There's about .0001% of magic, thrown into the mix of it, but that's all. Now a show about simple existence isn't always a bad thing, when the characters are at least interesting to watch. So... are these characters interesting to watch? Take a guess... Just like how the show can be described as \"nothing\", all of the characters can be described as \"nobody\". Not a single one of them has a personality. At all. I could not describe these characters, if my life depended on it. I even went and looked up the character descriptions for everyone on MyAnimeList, and even THEY can't describe these characters in more than 1 or 2 sentences. Probably my favorite description was for one of the main characters, Chinatsu. Her description is \"Younger sister of Kei. She dislikes bake because she thinks it's for adults.\" That about sums it all up, right there.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all nice people. That's about as much as I can say to describe them. Nice. They're always nice to each other. There isn't a single bit of conflict in the entire show. I could probably count on one hand, all of the sentences in all of the dialogue of the entire show that had even the slightest bit of conflict in them. There's literally nothing else to say about it. There's no conflict. No problem solving. No plot twists. No nothing. This is a show about nothing, starring a bunch of nobodies. As for the music, it's just as bland and nonexistent as the show, so at least it flows well with the show it's attached to. Still, you won't remember any of the songs in this show. Not even the opening or ending. The opening and ending are generic in both sound and visuals. Completely skippable. There's no english dub as of right now, so you're only option is sub. The voice acting is fine. No problems with it, at least. Though, if there ever is a dub, you may think this is a good show to have play in the background, while you do something else. Though, personally, I think it'd be better to leave the visuals in the background, and don't even worry about listening to what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is probably the best thing in the entire show. That's the whole reason I decided to watch this show, in the first place. The animation was done by J.C. Staff, a company that has worked on MANY other shows, and many that are far better than this one. Such as the previously mentioned Azumanga Daioh, Toradora, and one of my favorite shows, Little Busters. The animation in Flying Witch is really stinkin good. Scenery is beautiful and the characters are nicely detailed, despite their boring designs. HOWEVER. There is ONE thing in the animation that REALLY bugs me. And that is the character's noses. I know that that's a weird thing to complain about, but the character's noses all have this little light ring bubble on them, and it's VERRRRRRRY annoying to look at. Right from episode 1, that stupid light ring thingy bugged me, to no end. And it stays there, throughout the entire show. But other than that, the animation is near perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing left to talk about is that there are some OVA episodes, for Flying Witch. There are 9 episodes, each being no more than 2 minutes long, and being animated in a chibi CG art style. As for the plot of these OVA's... they have just as much of a plot as the regular show. In other words... nothing at all. So in conclusion, Flying Witch is nothing special in the absolute slightest. I don't think I'll ever be watching it, again. Though, I can't really say I HATED it, as weird as that sounds. It wasn't a bother to watch, being only 12 episodes. It was easy to follow, since there's literally nothing to follow, in the first place. It's nice to look at, and it may be fun to watch with your kids or younger siblings, since this is one of the few anime series that is actually appropriate for a very young audience. If you wanna watch this show to relax, I GUESS I can recommend it for that. Though, to save you some time, I would only recommend watching episodes 7, 8, 11, and 12. Those were my favorites out of the bunch, and you can honestly see what the entirety of the show is about, just by watching one of them. So ya. That's about it. If you're looking for a good slice of life show, with subtle magic that actually adds to the story, watch one of the Key anime. If you're looking for a slice of life with a plot, watch Ouran. If you're looking for a slice of life with actual comedy and actual characters, watch Azumanga. And if you want a show about literally nothing... watch Flying Witch... \\n\\n\r\nI'm honestly not sure where to leave off this review. On one hand, I was ok with watching this and it certainly wasn't a bother to do so, but on the other hand, I got absolutely NOTHING from watching this. So I'm gonna give this show a bit of a weird final score. If you're willing to watch this type of show and accept that you'll get absolutely nothing from watching it, I can give this show a 5. But if you don't want to watch this type of show, then I'd give it a 0. I know that isn't really a fair rating, since the fact that a show was even able to be created deserves at least SOME respect. In that case, I'll give it a 1. But please know that my rating of 5 doesn't mean the show is decent, and my rating of 1 doesn't mean the show is terrible. I'm giving it a 5, simply because it's the the most indifferent rating I can give. And with this show, I am 100% indifferent to its existence and to my experience watching it.\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch gets either a 1/10 or a 5/10.",

            "content": "Despite the title \"Flying Witch\", the show doesn't really feature a lot of Flying Witches or crazy witch battles. Instead, the show is just a super-relaxing slice-of-life series with a touch of magic. If you've watched titles such as Non Non Biyori then you can expect the same atmosphere from this show. \r\n[Story]\r\nFlying Witch is basically about a 15 year old witch named Makoto who moved into a rural town called Aomori to train as a professional witch. This is where the slice-of-life atmosphere begins. \r\nThe atmosphere of the show is super-relaxing. It's like you want to move out of this god-forsaken noisy/polluted city andjust live the rest of your days in a (almost) pollution-free quiet rural environment. That's what I felt like when I was watching an episode of Flying Witch every week.\\n\\n\r\nI heard that the creators mentioned Flying Witch as an \"iyashikei\" show or in English, a \"healing\" anime show. It's purpose is to basically have a healing or soothing effect on the audience, such as myself. The creators were right! I'm usually always busy on the weekends and having a show like Flying Witch calming down my stress level every week is a huge benefit for me. So not only does the show have a relaxing atmosphere but its \"iyashikei\"effect completely works and is the only reason why some of you lots shouldn't kill yourself. \\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch is definitely not for everyone and I can tell based on a few reviews/opinions that I've heard from other people. Nothing much happens throughout the show and the pacing is very slow. This might put off people who aren't a fan of slice-of-life genre and some might even find this show extremely boring. That's completely understandable because not everyone wants to watch a character following a cat around the town for an entire episode or drinking at a cafe for half of the episode. However to me, scenes such as the one I recently listed, weren't boring at all. They executed it in a way that made a scene like a character following a cat around the town for an entire episode not boring at all. \\n\\n\r\nOne last aspect that I want to talk about is the comedy. They are well done. The comedy isn't forced and they just let the characters do their thing while at the same time, not overdoing it so the funny moments doesn't turn stale. For example, Makoto is somewhat of a klutz and has a bad sense of direction. The show used them to make hilarious moments but they didn't overdo it to the point where she would come off as a dumb character. The character dynamics are also great and they really know how to pair these characters up to create a bunch of cute, heart warming and/or hilarious moments. Also, I forgot to mention that Chinatsu's reactions in the first few episodes are hilarious. It's a kind of reaction that you'd expect when seeing something so bizarre happening right in front of your eyes and just comes of as unbelievable at first.  What makes it even more hilarious is the fact that she's just a 9-year old kid and she's seeing something that she'd never expect that she'll see. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nLooking at Flying Witch's visuals and animation makes me somewhat excited at how future J.C Staff's anime will look like. This is actually their best visuals yet and it's way better than their previous works such as Index and Railgun. The visuals looks almost like real life at first look and the character designs are well done and it's not as bland as it used to be when comparing this show to their most recent work. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack definitely, and I mean DEFINITELY played a huge role on why the atmosphere is relaxing. The OSTs are phenomenal. Few examples are those slow piano bits or those slow guitar parts with a flute(?) playing at the same time. I really want to import those CD soundtracks. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Sharanran\" by miwa feat. 96 Neko. The OP theme song is absolutely catchy and I have been listening to it for the past 12 weeks. Also, those claps though. The ED theme song is \"Nichijou no Mahou\" by Makoto and Chinatsu. Same case as the OP. I love the song and both voice actors have great singing voices. It's not something that I'd expect from a slice-of-life show though but I guess it works. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. Each and every one of them has a set of unique personalities that makes them likable in their own ways. None of them came off as annoying. Especially, Chinatsu and Makoto who I thought was going to be very annoying at first but after watching the first episode, the way they acted was realistic and it blew my mind. I mean, it's rare to feature a cast of characters with realistic personalities instead of our usual \"Character has to be one of the \"dere\" traits\". For example, Chinatsu was acting like how a kid her age should act and it's hard to believe that Makoto is a 15 year old teenager considering the fact that she's super mature for her age and she likes to do adult stuff like farming, picking out plants and etc. Though, that doesn't mean Makoto acts exactly like an adult. Some of the things she does can come off as rather immature but that's normal since she's just a 15 year old teenager. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said above, the character dynamics are amazing. Pair one of these characters up with another character and you're going to get the same result regardless. A cute, heart-warming, smile-inducing, and funny moments. Chinatsu, Chito-san and Makoto does take the cake though whenever they're on screen.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you were to ask me like who's my favourite characters in the series then it would go something like this:\\n\r\nChinatsu > Chito-san > Akane > Makoto > Nao ..... and etc. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI had low expectations from this series before it aired but after the first few episodes, I ended up enjoying this anime as much as I did watching Non Non Biyori and Non Non Biyori Repeat. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nOut of 3 slice-of-life animes that I watched this season, Flying Witch is, no doubt, the best slice-of-life this season. The show's atmosphere is very relaxing and I'm glad that magic isn't widely used in the series. It shows us magic is one of those mysterious elements in our world. The characters are amazing and the show just lets these characters do whatever it wants, which lead to a bunch of cute, heart-warming, smile-inducing, and funny moments.  Now, I'm bummed out that I won't get my weekly doses of Flying Witch anymore to relieve my stress levels. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+The show's atmosphere is very relaxing\\n\r\n+Relaxing pacing\\n\r\n+Best animation J.C Staff has produced yet\\n\r\n+Very relaxing soundtrack\\n\r\n+Fun cast of characters\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-\\n",

            "content": "Spring 2016 is a season full of highs and lows. I mostly dealt with the latter, making myself too submerged in the negativity. But here comes Flying Witch, a show that has become known by now as a healing experience. Watching the show never fails to improve my mood. Everything about it just screams positivity and sunshine from the calming atmosphere, joyful characters, and the laid-back story. The often atmospheric moments such as scenery shots accompanied with beautiful calming music is truly bliss. The story of a young witch training in unfamiliar yet welcoming territory reminds me a lot of Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service, one ofmy favourite Ghibli films. While it does not offer any actual plot, each episode offers an adventure that constantly introduces supernatural elements and fits them well into the lighthearted slice-of-life approach. It does bother me occasionally that no one really bats an eye that witches live on their daily lives without trying to conceal their identity. The show doesn\u2019t really explain if witches are a norm in the society, or that the characters are just air-headed enough to not really care. \\n\\n\r\nOne main gripe I have with the show is that it could have utilized its story better. The show presents Makoto as a witch in training but we don\u2019t get any actual specifics regarding how the world of witches work aside from other witches that are introduced in the show such as her sister Akane. We get to see some witch stuff happening but it\u2019s mostly shown as amusement though some fit in the \u201cwitch training\u201d department. The show does try to blur the boundary between the two worlds but it would have been great if the show used more than one perspective.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend this show to slice-of-life fans who would like to see something atmospheric, calming, meditative, and positive. It doesn\u2019t use its potential to the fullest but nevertheless a fleeting euphoric experience.\\n",

            "content": "I'll start off by saying kudos, Flying Witch. It really took me by surprise how much I ended up enjoying this show.\r\nI pick up a number of shows per season, and Flying Witch was the one I knew least about. I got a very relaxed vibe from the first few episodes so I stuck with it. By the end of its run I was in awe how much this magical slice of life had won me over.\r\nThe colorful cast of characters we meet over the course of Flying Witch is definitely the standout ingredient here. Your typical slice of life is bound to have 1or 2 unbearable characters, but I honestly loved everyone we came across over this journey; from the various witches like accidental-furry Inukai and the adorable cafe assistant Anzu, to their familiars and the various creatures inhabiting the magical realm. \\n\\n\r\nThe main cast is extremely strong as well. Our witch-in-training Makoto is a very endearing main character. The little quirks like her lack of directional awareness are the greatest combination of goofy and adorable. Makoto's host family is also top-notch (I never understood that, were they related? Or just like really close family-friends? eh, it doesn't really matter). \\n\\n\r\nOlder brother Kei is Makoto's age and has to be praised for how chill he is. I've seriously never seen a dude in anime keep his cool so well around a house full of women. And there's no tacked on relationship between Kei and Makoto either. Their interactions throughout the show are extremely genuine and enjoyable. Everyone's interactions throughout this show are very well done, honestly. Even the parents, who lack the most screen time of the whole family have things to love about them. The mom is extremely mom-like, and the dad's heavy accent always gave me a good laugh, especially when his words flying right over Makoto's head.\\n\\n\r\nBut I have to give the MVP to little sister Chinatsu. She was consistently the funniest and most adorable one of this show. Everything from the way she speaks, to her mannerisms and movements captured the essence of a young girl very well, and the magical atmosphere around her only heightened that great childlike sense of wonder.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on about these characters all day. I'd love to talk about Makoto's rambunctious older sister Akane, or their feline familiar's Chito and Kenny, but we'd be here all day. \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: Characters - 10 outta 10.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have to talk about the art. This is one of the most beautiful shows I've seen recently, and that's coming from someone who is constantly on the prowl for shows with amazing art. The backgrounds and still-shots are impeccable. From flowing rivers with cherry blossoms overhead, to detailed close-ups of plants and vegetables, Flying Witch has some astonishingly great visuals.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the art and animation beautiful, but the designs of creatures and characters from the magic world are a sight to behold. There are some wondrously imaginative designs throughout this show. While I did sometimes get a Ghibli-esque feeling of astonishment as the various magical beings appeared on screen, my appreciation for these uniquely designed creatures was more comparable to something from Dark Souls or Bloodborne, games I highly value for their artistic direction and whimsical designs. The Harbinger of Spring's arrival in episode 2, and the Curtain of Night visiting the cafe in episode 8 both gave me that eerily creepy, yet beautiful feeling I get from Dark Souls enemies. Through and through, Flying Witch did not disappoint in the visual department.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are also filled with vibrant colors and breathtaking landscapes. They're both surprisingly catchy too. The soundtrack is the sweet little cherry on top of this wonderful sundae. It's very subtle, but adds tremendously to the mood of each scene.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no central plot or story to this show, but it really didn't need one. The lack of conflict made for a calm and relaxing ride the entire time. The small victories and natural progression is enough for the show to feel like its moving and that these characters are learning and experiencing new things.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is called Flying Witch, but Makoto doesn't even do that much flying, on screen anyways. The show moves forward at such a great pace, yet goes nowhere at all. We go along with Makoto each day on a new adventure, and though it doesn't seem like much, we do get to see, bit by bit, how she is coming to understand the world of magic surrounding her.\\n\\n\r\nWe see Makoto gently float into the air in the first episode, as the world of witches is revealed to Chinatsu for the first time. Makoto is still a novice with her broom, and we see her struggle with the way she uncomfortably rides it at first. But once episode 12 rolled by, and we drift with her over the peaceful city of Aomori, we see her riding her broom properly. There was no training montage, or countless escapades of Makoto clumsily falling off her broom. No, we see her naturally progress through the time she spent with the Kuramoto's, and as things come to a close, seeing Makoto ride her broom with such ease bears the fruits of her growth to us.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say it enough how much this show surprised me. I went in with zero expectations and left with something I'll hold as a magical experience of my own. Flying Witch came and went like that spring courier, filled with bewildering mystery, just to drift away after we've only scratched the surface. There's so much beauty and history left to explore in the world of Flying Witch, and I hope there will be more of it to come in the future.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Flying Witch is a good series to illustrate the appeal of slice of life (SOL) in its purest form.  It is an iyashikei series, a healing anime that attempts to soothe the viewer. Although other series  could do this with some sort of conflict or story to cover, Flying Witch is Iyashikei at its simplest with little to no conflict. It sticks to the basics without adding anything new, but it executes itself well enough to be worthwhile. But before we can see what Flying Witch did right, we must first answer why series of this nature with no conflict can be interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many who claim that SOL is a completely pointless genre on its own and that it only works alongside other genres in the case of series such as Planetes or Ashita no Joe. These individuals claim that it would be far more interesting to live one's own life than watch a series about individuals living mundane lives. Although this is an understandable criticism, it  is partially misguided, for Slice of Life series in their purest form fulfill a role similar to fantasy series. Whereas fantasy series allow the individual to escape beyond the constraints of physical world, a slice of life iyashikei series allows an individual to escape the restrictions that prevent paying attention to the simpler details in life.  Attempting to do so in the real world would often result in senseless thoughts that get in the way. It can be far more difficult to appreciate nature in the real world when one is spinning with thoughts and concerns, but within a piece of media, it is far easier to become absorbed in the experience.\\n\\n\r\nEven with this realization, the pertinent question is \"how could watching such mundane events be interesting?\" The answer lies all in attention. As the writer  Henry Miller suggested, \u201cThe moment one gives close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself.\" From this, we can gather that whether or not these mundane tasks are interesting depend on how well the particular series captures our attention. In the case of Flying Witch, it does so with the simplest trick in the Iyashikei book: atmosphere. Through the use of its artstyle and soundtrack, it immerses the viewer to the point that the viewer can find enjoyment in the simple tasks that he or she knows is relevant but is nonetheless difficult to appreciate in the real world. Tasks such as gardening and cooking are ones that Flying Witch tackles while (hopefully)  retaining the vewer's interest through its atmosphere.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, in addition to atmosphere, this type of show needs solid character interactions. Although none of the characters in Flying Witch are anything profound or special, they work well with each other. The cast consists of an airhead protagonist (Makoto), a spontaneous young girl (Chinatsu), a laid-back supporting male (Kei), and the MC's troublesome but knowledgable sister (Akane). Although the characters rarely surprise you with their personality, the ways in which they react with each other provide engagement. Akane's playfullness coupled with Makoto's cluelessness enables entertaining antics when the former is teaching the latter magic. Chinatsu's childlike and organic reactions to every situation are the most potent in the entire series, and Kei's reserved nature helps ground every event into a state of peace rather than conflict. The characters may be accused of being too bland or lacking in character, but this is not to say that the characters are necessarily unrealistic. Flying Witch never takes us within the psychologies of the characters, only relying on showing the outside. Externally, it mirrors the types of situations and reactions individuals would have in real life. For this reason, there is some element of realism despite the lack of depth, as individuals in the real world when examined from the outside (just as Flying Witch does) seem simpler than they really are. One may argue that the lack of conflict that occurs in the series is forced given that it would make sense for at least some of it, but in several mundane situations within the real world, conflict does not always occur. Speaking anecdotally, I can excuse this lack of conflict for in my own life, there could be weeks or months in which I have little to no conflict among any of my interactions. \\n\\n\r\nThis blandness may seem dull, but as the series attempts to portray the mundane nature of life, it works for the series. The dialogue and gestures throughout the series seem natural and organic, which is definitely needed in a series like this one. Flying Witch also bases a fair bit of its settings on real life, enabling those settings to feel far more realistic. As a series that embraces the simplicity of life, this is certainly a positive. Even the fact that the magic used within the series is unimpressive and rarely flashly aids with this anime's goal. By utilizing bland magic, it better juxtaposes the mundane with the magical, a theme inherent in almost all of Iyashikei. \\n\\n\r\nPertaining to the story itself, it is easy to guess by now that Flying Witch doesn't focus on many particularly interesting events. Rather than bouts of spectacle, there's an episode dedicated to a witches' restaurant and half an episode dedicated to thinning flowers from an apple tree. The content of the series is primarily episodic, but there are slight hints of continuity throughout the episodes. The episodes themselves aren't that repetitive in what they set out to do, but they don't really accomplish much on their own. It's all dependant on how well those episodes were able to engage the viewer by their content.\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch does have some idealization. For example, witches are never portrayed negatively, which contrasts with how they are perceived in reality.Sure, this is a small detail, but for a series that aims to ground itself a fair bit in reality, this can hinder the Suspension of Disbelief. Although a lot of conflict isn't needed in this type of show, it does feel idealized for having next to none at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest hindrance of Flying Witch is that it doesn't accomplish that much from a writing standpoint. It's basic in what it does, and though it does a good job, what it tries to do isn't anything particularly difficult to write. Those who value light-hearted entertainment will likely view this show more highly than those who focus more on writing and a story.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: (Personal Calssification\u2014Decent)\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch was a fairly entertaining watch. It's a soothing series that does what it is supposed to do. The animation, sountrack, character interactions, and attention to a detailed setting all work to enhance the experience.  \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend watching at least the first two episodes before deciding to continue or drop it. Flying Witch isn't a series for everyone, as there will still be many unconvinced by Iyashikei series as a whole, but for those who don't mind a soothing, heartwarming series without much of a story, Flying Witch is a great watch.",

            "content": "In the past, I've had a lot of good experiences with anime about witches. Kiki's Delivery Service, Shuumatsu no Izetta & El Cazador de la Bruja were all great or better. This time around, we're looking at Flying Witch. This one is based off of a manga by Ishizuka Chihiro wth the anime being handled by JC Staff. Yes, the same studio as Final Fantasy: Unlimited, Azumanga Daioh, Honey and Clover, & Potemayo. We've looked at their works a lot and with widely varying degrees of quality. Let's see where this one falls.\r\nStory:\r\nWe open with our heroine, Makoto, moving in with some relatives so thatshe can finish High school and be semi-independent like a good witch. From there we basically follow her as she spends time with friends & relatives while meeting supernatural beings and doing witch things. Basically, it's a slice of life with the twist being that it's about a witch.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really have any issues with the series in terms of narrative. Yeah, the story is very minimal with the various episodes all focusing on different slice of life situations that may not be connected to one another, but that's not really a problem. There are plenty of slice of life series like that and this one uses that format very well.\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch is very firmly an iyashikei series. If you aren't familiar with the term, it basically refers to an anime or manga that's designed around soothing the audience and making them feel good. The main tool it employs to gain this effect is making the supernatural elements highly comforting and whimsical. Whether it's a harbinger who just wants to say hello, an anthropomorphic witch who's really friendly and adorable, a shy ghost who just wants to serve tasty pastries or some other such thing, they're all designed around instilling a sense of delight. And because the supernatural elements are so integral to making the series enjoyable, they never seem gimmicky or pointless even though what they're being used for equates to faffing about. I also appreciate the way it takes the piss out of certain tropes like the \u201cmagical being who's supposed to be keeping their abilities a secret but everyone knows anyway.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWhen you have a light, fluffy series one of the things you absolutely need to go with it are endearing characters. Fortunately, that's another element that Flying Witch absolutely nails. The characters have eccentricities, but they aren't heavily exaggerated like they are in some comedies. Which makes them entertaining and fun while also preventing them getting overbearing. It also manages to have a child character who acts like a child, isn't annoying and is actually really charming. Which is not easy to do. And this is coming from someone who doesn't care for children in general. The characters also possess enough verisimilitude that they feel, largely, like real people. The only way they really stretch believability is that they're too good natured and you don't encounter many people with that level of goodness. Much less an entire world where it's everybody. But I can't complain about that since it's part of what makes it excel as an iyashikei series.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch has, I must say, superb artwork. It's not just that the backgrounds and character designs are really well done, although that helps. It's the entire supernatural aesthetic. The creatures they encounter are creative and interesting looking. The whale in particular stands out but there are a lot of other examples. The magic isn't flashy, but the more subdued use of it does work better for the relaxing atmosphere. So, good decision there.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe performances in this are really good. And, for most of the main actors, this is my first time hearing them give really strong performances. Shinoda Minami, Suzuki Eri, Sugawara Shinsuke & Aoi Kana included. I've heard Mikami Shiori and some of the minor characters in good anime before this one but most of the main cast don't have many credits which makes their performances all the more impressive. Dewa Yoshiaki's soundtrack complements the soothing atmosphere perfectly. I'll give him full credit on that one.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a bit. Inukai and Akane interact as though they're one confession away from ripping each other's clothes off and just going at it. Akane even describes Inukai as being too cute. There are also some interactions betwixt Makoto and Nao that make it seem like Makoto has more than a little crush.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something whimsical and endearing that'll soothe you, Flying Witch fits the bill damn near perfectly. If, on the other hand, you want something with an involved narrative and a lot of conflict, it's not going to be that. Ultimately, I really enjoyed watching it and would go so far as to say it's among the best iyashikei works I've seen. My final rating is going to be a 9/10. Next week, Dragoon.",

            "content": "Flying witch is a laid back slice of life anime with one of the most charming characters i've ever seen. It follows the story of Kowata Makoto who's a witch in training. All of the episodes cover the everyday life of this girl and her family and friends.\r\nWhat i like about Flying Witch in general is how relaxing it is. Now it is just a typical slice of life anime at first glance but each episode you start to enjoy it more and more until you can't get enough. \r\nWhat makes this a masterpiece is the combination of charming characters, gorgeous art, and over thetop calming music. All of these just compliment each other so well.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this point on there's some really minor spoilers so keep in mind. REALLY minor.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] (This part have some minor spoilers, you can skip this.)\\n\r\nEven though there's really not much into the story in Flying Witch, or slice of life anime in general. But Flying Witch just makes the simplest and boring stuff interesting. What i noticed while watching Flying Witch is how this anime has ZERO drama. There's absolutely no drama, everyone's so chill all the time. There were plots where i thought there would be some drama but no they just play it off and it turned into a funny scene and i laughed my ass off. By the way, yeah this anime is really funny. Found myself can't stop laughing at times.\\n\\n\r\n[Art]\\n\r\nThe art is well typical J.C Studio style, of course with it's own characteristics for Flying Witch. What makes this special is just how beautiful it is. Especially the green scenery and everything. Deserve a solid 9.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]\\n\r\nNow the music in this anime is just extremely calming and just gives off that country side feel, kind of like harvest moon/stardew valley (game) vibe. They fit in the anime so well. This whole anime reminds me of stardew valley, how they pick up wild plants in the side of the street and cooks them, just like in the game. Anyway i'm sidetracking, the music gets a 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\r\nThe characters can be described as a few words: Charming, happy, cheerful, silly, funny, chill,cute and more. They are absolutely no antagonist in the anime. Don't forget about the familiars in the anime, they are characters too. My favorite is Chito the black cat. SO CUTE. The facial expression in this anime are hilarious af.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\r\n Definitely was not bored while watching any of the episodes. They 20 mins episode felt like 5 mins, they went by so quick. Really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\r\nThis was one of the best slice of life anime's i've watched. Of course it's not for everyone, maybe someone find it boring or uninteresting but it's definitely good for me. If you find it boring the first few episodes, don't stop watching. You'll fall in love later. Might even get a S2 since there's still manga material to be covered.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it from me, this is just my opinion, if yours is different well no problemo. Have a good one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVTK_rRZwu4",

            "content": "REVIEW: Flying Witch\r\n\"How is this rated a 7.69!? This is a great slice-of-life anime. In my opinion. Why? Well, read my review and you'll see why!\r\nStory: (8/10) Here's my take on the synopsis. Makoto, being the witch she is, the story practically revolves around her alongside her cousins, Kei and Chinatsu. With the start of each episode, as a witch in training, Makoto explores Aomori, Japan with her two cousins to expand her surroundings. By exploring together, the crew encounters many things. May it be companions, magical beings, creatures and places unperceivable from the human eye! With the help of her surroundings and as awitch living with her two cousins in Aomori, Japan, her goal is to become a 'Flying Witch' someday!\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10) The animation is fluid, and simply beautiful since this anime is made by the one and only and as expected J.C. Staff! The creators who made Toradora!, Kaichou wa-maid Sama! and many other notable anime! There's nothing more great you can get from them (well, there are a few exceptions), but can expect great art from this anime!\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10): The music is one of it's strong points. Because, two words. It's. Relaxing. And. Soothing. That's five, nevermind. But anyways, for those who have watched Gin no Saji, the singer   'miwa' sings both the first opening of Gin no Saji and for the opening of this anime as well! I can appreciate that the opening, ending, and let's not forget the soundtrack matched the tone and quality of this anime! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s) (8/10): You may think the characters are dull, boring, and are lacking of variety through the first two episodes. But, the characters are as well one of its strong points. The reason why it's one of it's strong points because it strays away from all the other anime cliques we're all tired seeing of. Don't expect any dere(s), loli(s), shota(s) and etc. But do expect some quite interesting magical beings as well as adorable little creatures! As each and every character have a fun, original, unique personality to them! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): By watching the first two episodes, my first impression of this anime was 'indifferent'. I thought it would be some other anime slice-of-life cliche. As the third episode strolled along however, I found newfound respect for this anime. The fun adventures they have together, things they find that are unperceivable from the human eye, make me want to be part of their adventures! A fantasy you'd want to indulged in. As that being the case, I can quite say that I'd enjoyed this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10): Along with Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge, this anime stands as one of the best anime to watch of the Spring season. Each and every episode was filled with intriguing stories, I must say, to watch! I can say that the characters even though they were simple, were unique in a way! Art was presented greatly as expected from the J.C. Staff. Sound absolutely was relaxing and soothing at the most part! Most importantly I enjoyed this anime from beginning to end! If you want a relaxing and soothing anime to watch after watching a 'stressful' anime, I definitely recommend this one! Expect yourself to smile and chuckle at each and ever episode! \\n\\n\r\n- I want a season two! \\n\\n\r\nRAW:\\n\\n\r\n8.79/10.00\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\n9.00/10.00",

I can't recall exactly the shows, But I've had some shows that kind of feel the same or are alike and they're just not that great.\r\nThe Slice of Life and Magic is a nice pair up in this. It's honestly nice and calming with no threat about anything. It honestly baffles me that I never once found myself bored with this show. Normally, These shows can barely hold my attention for long.\r\nI do find it kind of disappointing that there is little in the ways of magic happening.  We see very little of anything happening. I do alsowish that Makoto ( MC ) Was smarter in the knowledge of magic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the best.\\n\\n\r\n-Chinatsu Is a surprisingly adorable girl that I don't find annoying. Normally I can't stand kids with most of them being boy characters. Girls tend to be less annoying but still are usually badly done.\\n\\n\r\n-Makoto's is a pretty awesome MC. She is an always adorable girl and can be very naive about things that just makes her all the more entertaining. I really like both Makoto and Nao. They are pretty good friends together and I love how Nao is always trying to keep up with Makato.  Even though there isn't romance. I did notice some slight Yuri cues, I don't know if it was intentional. But both Nao and Makoto would make a perfect ship.\\n\\n\r\n-Nao is fun to have on the screen whenever she's on tv. The only issue is that we barely see her. I like her design and is my 2nd or 3rd favorite of the show. Again, The friendship between both her and Makoto is pretty good. I would ship them if this was the type of show.\\n\\n\r\n-Akane is a pretty good tomboyish character that I like. I'd say her design is up there fighting for my favorite character design of the show. I'd say she is my 2nd or 1st favorite. I like both Nao's and Makoto's friendship a good amount. But I'd defiantly say I adore the friendship between Akane and Inukai. With Akane always causing trouble for Inukai and Inukai and Akane seems to be more natural friends. I of course ship the both of them and feel that in the actual show, That there is some actual Yuri tension between them.\\n\\n\r\n-Inukai I like. It's kind of interesting how due to her mistake, She is for the foreseeable stuck in a Beastkin type form of a Dog ( She looks more like a fox to me) It's kind of an adorable design. Just like I said to Akane description, The friendship is my favorite. I also obviously ship the two of them.\\n\\n\r\nI love this show and hope we get more in the future. I'm not putting my hopes on it. But I do like this show a lot.",

It has magic, that's sure, but it's different, more classic and, in some ways, more deep.\r\nStory: 6\r\nWhy only 6? Because that series doesn't have a story, and doesn't need it, in my humble opinion.\r\nThe events of the various episodes are well managed, so the time will flow easily while watching.\r\nArt: 7\r\nWhat can i say...the \"visual\" part of the anime is not memorable, but it fits perfectly the paceand the atmosphere of the series, and for me that's the most important thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nNice voice acting and pretty op/ed. The main dish, though, is the OST; it harmonize with sceneries, moods and situations, giving a push on the emotions that the spectator feels.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nI have to say it, as the story doesn't exist, even the characters aren't so original or deep, or have some sort of development trough the series...but they work, and the work pretty well.\\n\r\nWith so many anime out there i think that's nearly absurd to pretend originality everywhere, so i don't give much weight to that point in my evaluation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis series was a fresh wind that have traveled trough seasons, bringing along the scent of everything that has encountered, and the results it's something great.\\n\r\nIt's a slice of life, the comedy part is not so funny, the \"witch magic\" appears maybe one time for episode, but the real magic is everywhere. If I have to analize every single element the rate will not be so high, but the show have a strange sort of alchemy that it was able to put all the parts in a pot, cook them at low fire and take out the best from all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 well deserved!",

            "content": "Flying Witch is possibly one of the most relaxed, tranquil anime bestowed upon this world. This show was a gem among stones this season, with nothing else keeping me particularly hyped for the next episode. Despite this show having a basic plot and absolutely no movement in the story (not physically anyway) this was absolutely one of my favourites this season.\r\nStory: 8\r\nFlying Witch is about, well, a flying witch. Her name is Kowata Makoto, she leaves the city of Yokohama to live with her relatives in the small town of Aomori to train as a witch. That's about it, each episode depicts the antics allthe characters get up to together, from simple activities like cooking at school or making a vegetable patch, to creating potions and discovering new spells accompanied by the other witch characters, Akane (Makoto's sister) and Inukai (Akane's friend). These activities were enjoyable to watch, there was no flashy spell-casting or explosions or intensity, just relaxing and calming to watch. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe setting of Aomori is absolutely beautiful, lush landscapes and aerial shots of the town and surrounding environment are frequently shown and used effectively to transition scenes and display the location of our characters next \"everyday\" event. The characters looked fairly stock-standard, you've seen this style before, but it is nice to look at, they look like normal people. I think that's another reason this show feels so relaxing to watch, the characters don't look like they're out to fight evil or blow shit up, they lead normal lives and do normal stuff, simple and effective.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nWhile the OP of Flying Witch is questionable at times, personally I enjoyed it sometimes, didn't really at others. The ED was beautiful, really nice way to tie off each episode, especially as sometimes I didn't even feel it coming, and assumed it was part of the episode. On the topic of that, the soundtrack was incredible, so god damn tranquil. The quiet sounds of the mornings accompanied by soothing acoustic guitar sets each episode off with a fresh and warm feeling. The SFX used in comedic scenes also works perfectly, with a wonky, quirky tone to it that, in my opinion, emphasizes the scenes dialogue or topic effectively.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nYou've seen all these characters before, they are quite easy to predict and you can guess their next personality trait in an instant. But, this doesn't mean they don't keep the show going, Makoto is gorgeously bubbly and excited by such simple things you can't help but gush, Akane receives the label of crazy, adventurous, show-offy alcoholic big sister, but still adds important input to the dialogue and her storytelling adds an entire new level to the world that the show is set in. Kei and Chinatsu are both great characters, Kei being the understanding, kind and welcoming male lead, always willing to spark the events of the episode, and teach both the other characters and the viewer (well, me at the least) new things about the particular activity being done. Chinatsu is cute as fuck, and her excitement and open-mindedness makes every scene a happy one, her charm and bubbly personality surpass Makoto, and her clueless-ness at some points has a very distinct curiousity to it, pulling the viewer in and forming a surrogacy of inquisition.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show very much, I enjoyed watching these simple characters interact and grow deeper bonds with each other as they performed everyday tasks and just simply had innocent fun together. That's really all there is to it, this show has such a simple formula and executes it perfectly. Making such simple activities interesting to watch and difficult to stop.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nBasically if you've got a cup of tea or something in your hands, lying in bed, or on the couch, relaxed in the early morning and you watch this, you've pretty much got no excuse not to feel spectacularly tranquil and enlightened. If your looking for something light-hearted and easy to watch, I encourage you to watch Flying Witch. \\n\\n\r\n~Xeno156",

            "content": "Sometimes you just wanna sit and relax watching some traquil animes, without the exagerations, explosive fights, over-the-top romance and all the other traits that most animes have, if you want a fun light slice of life anime, with characters that act (most of the time) like a tipycal anime character, you've found it!\r\n Flying witch is, basically, another  slice of life anme, but, on top of that, it has witchcraft... sometimes. It's fun and if you like slice of life, you'll probably like this anime a lot, i did.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\n [NO spoilers] The story of this anime is not very deep, it worksmostly as a background, the anime presents to you that, in this world, there are some witches and they do some witch stuff. They don't show much of that, in all the anime there's, probably, 6 spells, and most of thame they just... fly in brooms. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, the anime choose to focus on the life of Makoto, a (surprisingly) 15 years old [she looks like 20 lol] that lives a peaceful life on a town in a kinda rural (not really rural side, but it looks like it is sometimes) town. The story then progress showing the life of makoto and her friends there, not escaping much of this theme. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\n  Cool, it's not surprisingly good, but it's good. There are some scenes where they fly that are really good, that's it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\n  Eh, the op is cool, but the rest of it is just... generic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\n  You know them, they're in all animes you've watched. The characters are just... normal, makoto is fun and i like her a lot, but the best character is her cat. Overall, the cast is not complex, but they have memorable traits, althought they don't act mostly like a real person, it's just what you expect, but you can feel that they work fine in the context of the anime. There are some characters with cool concepts that appears just once, and some don't even say anything, but gives kinda of a veracity to the world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\n  This anime is F U N, you cant just sit, relax, and be entertained by it, they always keeps the anime fresh with some others things to the characters to do and, when you noticed, the day is over and you watched all the episodes without leaving your room.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\n  There's nothing left to say about it. It's a slice of life, a relaxing and fun anime. If you like relaxing anime like yuru camp, Non Non Biyori, Usagi drop, barakamon, gin no saji, etc. you will definitely like it, it has no real conflit (like, for example, barakamon) but nonetheless still a good time.",

            "content": "If you're looking for an 'iyashikei' (healing) anime, this is definitely a good choice - no drama, all fun, and you feel refreshed once watching it. \r\nThe Story - As the show is a slice of life anime, the episodes aren't very story driven; episodes don't lead on from one to another, meaning there's a fresh new story each time you watch. The magic element really sets this show apart though - there's no war going on, the protagonist isn't on some long-winded quest or anything. Instead, it's about a young girl and her training as a witch. Simple, but it works.\r\nThe Art - Watchingthe show has a sort of calming effect; there's no flashy colours or effects. You're instead given a beautifully gentle looking show that really matches the anime's atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound - The OP and ED are both cute and match the tone of the show pretty well, much like the background music. Whilst the tracks aren't memorable, they add to the calming effect of the show, and help to immerse you into Makoto's world.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters - Every single character has their own unique charms and quirks. Makoto's kind yet eccentric personality, Chinatsu's random one liners, and even Kei's subdued personality really make the show what it is. Akane will always keep you coming back as well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Flying Witch was one of those shows that I underestimated; I didn't really pay that much attention when I watched the first few episodes, but when I restarted it, I realised when a gem it was. Funny, calming, and a show that I think anyone could enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Flying Witch gets an 8/10. A charming show, with it's characters being the backbone to it's charm. I'd recommend this show to anyone; anime fan or not.",

            "content": "Flying Witch is a fantastic series and breaks the norm from the supernatural series of the past and present.\r\nAs I will say every time, I love any series that is set in a rural area. Something about it enables me to relax and take in a show with little to no effort while still enjoying it. What's more is we get witches and the like added to the mix. Normally, when it comes to having this element in a series, it mostly involves shounen battle sequences, good versus evil and whatnot. Here, we just have witches (the rest mostly being spirits of nature) living amongsthumans with no conflict. Rarely do we see this ever happen, and I'm glad a series like this exists.\\n\\n\r\nWhat also makes this entertaining is the characters. They're all likable and have some good interactions with each other. From the timing of their dialogue to their amusing expressions, it's hard not to smile when you see these characters appear.\\n\\n\r\nI think what makes this a good series set in the \"countryside\" is how the animation depicts the scenery. So much detail is put into the houses and the nature that it looks realistic. Also, the character designs are very appealing and cute.\\n\\n\r\nDon't think that I dislike anything action-oriented or shows that are strictly shounen, far from it. It's just, you do see a lot of them with each season, and it can get a little tiresome. Which is why shows like Flying Witch allow me to take a breather. It's a nice change of pace; it's meant to be relaxing where you can easily take in everything.",

Makoto Kowata voiced by Minami Shinoda, the main character is really our eyes for both the rural and magical world that she lives in and her quirks such as having no sense of direction and always in awe and slightly naive with the rural life but nonchalantly ambitious when it comes to magic make her memorable along with Chinatsu and Akane. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this anime does have them for a good punchline here and there, from the rural comedic skits that are charming (to some of them that \"kinda land\"), for the magic side, the punchline hits a bit better and the main cause of that would be the eccentric characters of being both catalysts and reactants to them (Akane and Chinatsu respectively) that works in it's favour\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by JC Staff feels like what would happen if Studio Ghibli's background artist came into JC Staff as the background to heck even the character designs have that feel to it. flying witch REALLY is a laxxing anime from the animation to the setting.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, it was nothing special and once again the voice actors have something of a laxxing tone to them well cept Eri Suzuki due to having bundles of energy and her childlike and whimsical nature. One thing LA found weird was that the cats in this anime, those being Chito voiced by Ai Kayano and Kenny voiced by Ayane Sakura just do \"cat noises\", it's not horrible or anything but Ai Kayano and Ayane Sakura must have a laxxing time with this anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is like the animation largely reminiscent of Studio Ghibili's and the music really wrings in the atmosphere  from the whimsical to the comically aloof moments here and there, LA usually doesn't talk about the music in the anime, but flying witch kinda had to remind LA about the music.\\n\\n\r\nLA might as well say this about slice of life animes, many people might dismiss it as a waste of time or \"too moe\", but really LA can see why not only from flying witch but many other slice of life animes is that it doesn't need to be intense, batshit crazy full of action or intense drama, we really DO kind of need these of kinds of animes where we and along with the characters to be relaxed and not really need to be 100% invested in all the intense drama or action, just characters doing their everyday things with a comedic flair and flying witch is one of the pinnacle examples of healing slice of life animes that puts this statement and flies with it no pun intended.\\n\\n\r\nLA will say it again, \"flying witch is one of the best healing anime this Spring 2016\" and really if you wanted to have a relaxing anime with no stakes and just want to relax with the characters of this anime then flying witch is a perfect choice.",

That said, this doesn\u2019t mean that Flying Witch is a bad or uninteresting series. If there was one word I would use to sum up Flying Witch, it would be \u201ceasygoing\u201d. This is one of the most relaxing anime in a long time, a simple show about simple pleasures.\r\nEach episode of the show is a small slice of the life of Makoto, a girl who moves to live with her extended family to finish school while also completingher training to become a full-fledged witch. Her magic skills still need a great deal of work, but her charming (if slightly odd) personality endears her to those she meets and she lives a life of simple pleasures and adventures. This is an anime without any major conflicts, antagonists, or drama. The cast of characters-which includes her mortal cousins completely new to witchcraft, her supernatural neighbors and friends, and her easygoing but talented older sister- is enjoyable, and the experiences that Makoto and those around her go through are refreshingly uncomplicated and full of charm. Each week reveals a bit more about the rituals and lives of witches, but the main focus is not the witchcraft or magic itself, but rather how magic is all around us and the way witches and other beings use it in their everyday lives. It is definitely a slice-of-life show more than a show focusing on fantasy or magic, and the magical aspect is treated as part of Makoto\u2019s normal daily life. \\n\\n\r\n+Charming cast of characters\\n\r\n+Relaxing atmosphere\\n\r\n+Simple plots made interesting \\n\\n\r\n-Not much character development\\n\r\n-Not for those expecting deep story\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is sweet and simple with a touch of comedy. If you\u2019re looking to unwind with an enjoyable show without any bells or whistles, Flying Witch is a good fit. I would recommend watching an episode every once in awhile rather than binge on the series as a whole, as that way the charm and simplicity really shines through.\\n",

            "content": "Flying Witch has to be the most light heartening refreshing anime ever made. It's a far deviation away from a typical school SOL and (violent) adventure types,  I can't really put the right words together to describe it. I invite you to join the world of Flying witch because I do not think you will be disappointed. The character development is great and every second of every episode leaves you with a sense of fulfillment. Which is a very hard thing to have. The show is bright and airy and well...Just go watch it!\r\nKeep in mind with this though: Not a lot really happensin this anime. There is no backbone story line guiding the plot in any one direction. It's just a hodgepodge of \"let's do this today!\" So if you're not really into that, this may not be your cup of tea.",

            "content": "Ahhh! That\u2019s the sound of wild mandrake root makes when pulled out of the ground. Flying Witch, is special a soothing anime one to calm the heart and not provoke to much though, just enjoy the show for what it is, a SoL with small hints of supernatural. Interactions between characters\u2019 flow naturally, with cute moments between one another. Hints of fond moments between supernatural elements such as Ghosts, Spirits, Mythical creatures and so forth.\r\nOur journey begins with a cat Chito and high school girl Kowato Makoto moving to Aomori, Japan. Makoto is newly transferred witch, which is atrocious when it comes to directions perhapsnot even able to tell left from right. Anyhow she\u2019s a witch that moves in with Kei Kuramoto, Makoto second cousin along with his younger sister Chinatsu Kuramoto. Makoto purpose for moving is due to tradition for practitioners, after they turn 15 years old, they must become independent. Although Makoto parents insist that she at least finish high school and instead of living on her own she move in with relatives.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto is shown around the city by Chinatsu, even if a first Chinatsu had her doubts seeing as Makoto after all was taking with her cat Chito. As if the two of them were having a conversation of their own and perfectly understanding each other, it was out for Chinatsu after all. It\u2019s through Chinatsu small tour of her town that the two become more well acquainted and costumed to each, even stopping by and eating a local donut shop. Later, it\u2019s when Makoto finds a stack of brooms for sale. Unlike any other ordinary person, she levitates herself of the ground with the broom. It\u2019s a that very moment Chinatsu understand that Makoto is a witch. Life about to get more interesting for a little group especially with Makoto around.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t help but admire the animation for this anime is looks gorgeous and adorable. It\u2019s so heartwarming and believable the setting and the atmosphere of their world with hints of magic here and there. It\u2019s as if were truly being thrown in a magical world, discovering and be an awe-gasping creatures and things Makoto shows us. When it comes to OST it\u2019s soothing like the realms of Mushishi or calming rain water in the middle of the night. Flying Witch, OP is splendid to say, setting tone for the show an enjoyable, vibrant, strong color pallet anime. A slice of life anime with hints of magic, that\u2019s the vibe I receive when I see the opening. It\u2019s ED is a mellower one as if it\u2019s saying it\u2019s goodbye as Makoto walks through the rain but it\u2019s the music in which I enjoyed much more compared to the OP.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d love the integration between its realistic world with small hints of magic it\u2019s gratifying. It doesn\u2019t need to go full on magic extravaganza, being fond of magic in the bounds of realism made this a fantastic watch. Leaves you with a feeling that such things as \u2018Magic\u2019 do exist in our world. Now switch off your brain admire the detailed backgrounds, gorgeous character designs in which all tie together when it comes to Flying Witch.\\n",

I like every single anime that is having realistic personalities. all of the reaction are pretty realistic that i somehow connected and relatable to their emotions and reactions if i ever encounter the scenario. Makoto is the best girl out of all Slice-of-life anime i ever watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, all of the clothes she used (well, all of the characters) is respectable and not sexy neither too shorts. i really love her school uniform with that big legging socks(?). i can't ever hardly think even just a little about sexiness in these anime because how well their clothes are.\\n\\n\r\ncan we just, copy these style of fashion into every anime please? so i can watch it without awkward panty shot or awkward camera boobs/butt shots? because i watch for the plots. and those shots are unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is 11/10:\\n\\n\r\nLike come on. when i found out about this anime from a clip in youtube, i was a bit confuse at same time have a string that pulling me to \"watch this!\" anime. so i decide to take a shot and my god, it is very enjoyable. you can watch it with whole family without having any awkward conversation or awkward scenarios. and plus, no such a thing called emotional ride in this anime. it is literally flat out relaxing and happy anime.\\n\\n\r\nNote to all new watchers: forget everything you think about and just enjoy the episodes. Make a comfortable position when you watch it to have full experience. i recommend to watch it in the day right near a window when there's not much noise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall ratings from me, 10/10. i just hope the second season showed up already so i can take a chill from the stress i got.",

An incredible mix that, for 12 episodes, transports you with Makoto and friends in this beautiful series made of laughs, sweetness and a hint of nostalgia. Those in search of romantic stories is the wrong place. The series about friendship, first of all, embedded in this supernatural Japan rich in traditions, which seems to slip away as time passes. The episodes fly away so light and so well made that we find ourselves at the last episode, wondering: \"Will there be a sequel?\". Having almost afraidto see it, not to have to say goodbye already Makoto and her companions. Honestly everyone has their own tastes, but the best review you can do is to recommend whether or not to see anything. Then friends I would highly recommend you watch this Anime. You will not regret it.\\n",

I would watch this anime if you are to tired to concentrate. Also a good anime to watch when drunk/high. Expect very little plot/character development. I wish a lot more slice of life anime could be more like flying witch. To me most of the popular slice of life anime's are boring or they are washed out. Most anime in this drama also seem to be trying to hard and they still seem to be unoriginal and just like every other anime.yes flying witch's plot isn't original but the characters are not as stereotyped and the anime has no intent of showing anything sexual with the characters which I rarely see in anime. \\n",

Seeing them integrate & understanding magic from Makoto is awesome. It is also funny to see more of the magical world that Makoto was brought up in by her parents. It's also a bonus to meet various characters in the magical world & seeing how they balance their lives in reality.  \r\nCHARACTERS (7/10):\r\nMakoto is 15 year old witch who has moved to her cousins' place. She needs to work on flying skills. Her familiar is Chito. She is a kind, soft-spoken witch that is friendly witheveryone she meets. Makoto is constantly learning about magic and improving her sense of direction. \\n\r\nKei is a cousin of Makoto and older brother of Chinatsu. He is the same age as Makoto and is always helping her out. Kei is also afraid of ghost.\\n\r\nChinatsu is a young girl who was first skeptical about magic but is now amazed. Ever since Makoto's arrival, Chinatsu aspires to be like her and learn magic. She is also very helpful with her family and curious about various characters in the magical world. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT (7/10):\\n\r\nI usually love watching slice of life and this anime is no exception (obviously). It's great to see the journey of Makoto as a young witch while growing up as a regular teenager. This anime is very similar to Studio Ghibli's film -- Kiki's Delivery Service. & for those who have seen the film\u2026 you will see why. Plus, the only thing I would like this anime to improve on is to have more variety of the settings (other than the countryside). Since Makoto is able to fly on her broom. She should also have the opportunity to travel around the world and meet new people as well.",

            "content": "Occasionally we are told by people to just relax. Well if I were to say that to somebody and had advised that person to watch an Anime to achieve this I would wager Flying Witch would probably be it as this show is one of if not the most laid back series ever made. \r\nI'd go so far to say it's tranquil bliss. Blending slice of life with a light sprinkling of fantasy the show is incredibly comforting and easy going practically to a fault because honestly for a show starring a witch there really isn't a whole lot of witch business going on. Therecertainly is plenty of fantastical occurrences sewn in among the general slice of life fabric of the show but strangely the series downplays it all as the norm to such a degree that alot of the magic is lost. This is something I'm both okay and somewhat not okay with, I very much on the fence on it being a better show for it or a worse show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I think thats okay, this show isn't out there to challenge your brain so much as it is here to help it switch off and forget the real world. In that the Flying witch is a rounding success and definitely something I would recommend you check out sometime.",

At the time of writing, this is possibly the most underrated show I've come across on MAL.\r\nI see people describe Flying Witch as a healing anime. Sure; semantics aside, it's a slice of life anime with a light-hearted feeling, and I would say I haven't enjoyed a show of this style this much since K-On. You know when you want to just sit down and put something on for an episode or two before bed? That's Flying Witch. It's the genuine characters and their interactions that makeyou want to watch more.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace is slow but not droll. It keeps you amused without really needing a \"raise-the-stakes\" mentality. From start to finish it feels very episodic (though due to characters introduced and few total episodes etc... you can't really watch it out of order). But not much is really accomplished, and that's fine. That's what you're watching for. Most episodes introduce a character that may pop up later, but for that episode you just get to enjoy the mystery of finding out who that person is and their story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I do like is how natural the characters and their interactions feel. There's just a tale on display that you get whisked along for, and you can really stop at any time. All I'm saying is... try it out. Get lifted up by the breeze and see if you feel like being carried for a bit. I don't think you can really be disappointed, but if you're not one for a carefree pace, it might not be for you.",

In this anime we watch the daily life of Makoto, her relatives and their friends, which is a normal life in the countryside. Well, except that there are witches, ghosts and stuff like that. In the \"healing\" section, Flying Witch does an amazing job. There are no conflicts or characters acting mean (Akane plays some pranks, but they are never going overboard or anything) and we witness people enjoying their lives and having fun. The magical part is always present and keeps gettingmore interesting as the show goes on, though I personally would have wished for a little more of it in the first half.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOkay, yes, the bus in episode one looked bad. BUT! later we get to see a CGI whale that looks amazing, which makes me believe they were under time constraints for the first episode. Everything else is also very beautiful to look at. It is not overly colorful most of the time (compared to Anne Happy for example), but the countryside setting is used well to show of the wonderful nature. The character design was pretty good too, slightly moe but not too much.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening is fun and will be stuck in your head for a couple of hours (or more), which is always a good thing. The ending is nothing special, but well made. People have criticized Shinsuke Sugawara (voice of Kei) for the impression he left in episode one, but he got better and better as the show went on, becoming quite good. That's astounding for someone in his VERY FIRST seiyuu role. Everybody else did a good job as well, special mention goes out to the voices of Akane and Chinatsu.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI don't think I have ever seen an anime before where every single character was so incredibly likeable. They are all very fun people to be around and they are so nice! There is not a single bad thing I can point out.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWatching Flying Witch was so much fun, that realizing that it's over now makes me sad for real. Provided you like Iyashikei (generally called relaxing or healing anime), I highly recommend this anime to you. It could very well be the epitome of its genre and I really, really hope there will be a second season one day.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.2/10",

This anime is funny, healing and really worth the time if you are a fan of slice of life.\r\nWatching this is very soothing, just helps you relax from time to time. The visuals are also very suitable for slice of life anime such as this.\r\nCharacters are also quite funny and very heartwarming. \r\nThis is not comparable with slice of life anime like non non biyori which is much better, this has more of \"harry potter\" element and has much knowledge regarding witch craft.The whale island is much amazing as well, reminded me of rune factory game from Nintendo Wii, and has many enjoyable fantasy elements. Recommended for those who enjoy both the slice of life and fantasy elements. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series very much and would give 8/10 overall.",

            "content": "I don't particularly like slice-of-life shows, because I find it less exciting than other shows (and that the writer had to do similar things to others almost all the time). Flying Witch is the kind of show that I don't particularly want to watch at first glance, but I always find the urge to watch it whenever I noticed that the new episode comes out.\r\nThe story is as what it sounds like. A witch comes to town, people get shocked, people get over it, then magical stuff happened. It's not as disastrous as monster comes in every now and then, but not as school lifeas it can be. In fact, while they are still in school, many episodes were not school related. The pacing is quite suitable, they don't rush for progression (since slice-of-life usually are not about progressing the plot), but keep everything in a row so that you remember things. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. I enjoy watching the scenery whenever I find the need to look away, and it does not disappoint most of the time (if not all the time).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is quite memorable. I find myself sitting through the OP most of the time, because it's quite the earworm. The background music played whenever they are doing things and not talking, is also quite suitable. It's quite fresh since the shows I watched are mostly fast-paced fighting shonen anime, and I find it quite relaxing to just sit back and relax.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design was...basic? I do enjoy they being quite naturally coloured (and not anime-coded colour). The non-human part also show quite a bit of work, which is all beautiful. The character introduced was not overwhelmingly a lot (as per slice-of-life), and their personality don't overlap but rather complement each other. So it showed a good chemistry between their relationship and I enjoyed them interacting with each other, rather than just the main lead interacting with one at a time. However, I find Kei's role being not very obvious, as he does not show as much screentime as the others, while being like the only male main character (not counting non human male characters). Ah well, it's called Flying Witch for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nI had to say, I enjoyed this show quite a bit. While I don't necessarily love the show, I would consider re-watching an episode or two when I'm down just to cheer me up enough to continue with my miserable life. Overall, I would recommend this show, even if you don't care about slice-of-life.",

The entire series is lacking any conflict or extensive developments, which were far and away the best parts of the show. The sister's arrival and the magical phenomena (the mandrake, burning the hair, the black and white river) were the best parts, but overall the series came and went and literally it was just a bunch of characters in a room talking about obvious and/or dull things with almost every other sentence ending in sugoi! (amazing) or eehhhh! They would call such random things amazing. Oh youown a liquor store, or can spin around in a circle, or like to eat fried herbs, or can make curry? Amazing!\\n\\n\r\nThat dynamic definitely enhanced the feeling the show gave off of just shallow, fake characters. Everybody was too happy basically all the time, and people would get excited over weird things. Three middle school boys were literally looking at a cat in a tree and say \"Amazing, that cat is so cool.\" That just feels dumb to me. \\n\\n\r\nI only finished the show because I'm a completionist and because I wanted to see if they would actually make some type of plot with the reason she moved there (to train as a witch). Spoiler, they don't. Not well at least. So yeah, bad show",

            "content": "-No Spoilers Below-\r\nFirst and foremost please understand that this anime is relatively slow. It is a comedy slice of life with aspects of magic/fantasy though not an insane amount. \r\nI quite enjoyed this anime after watching it. Unlike most anime it was not in a rush to shove as much detail down my throat as humanly possible. Which to be fair is often something i dislike about a lot of anime. Shoving 24 + EP worth of stuff into a 12 anime series. As follows will be my ratings and thoughts. \r\nStory: I'm not gonna lie this anime had a solid story. Certainly not a10/10 but easy to follow and quite nice to watch casually. It does not beat you over the head with anything like some other anime tend to do, but it also just goes at it's own pace. Grant you this pace is what makes people rate it poorly because they consider slow anime to be \"Boring\" or \"Pointless\". Lack of fighting or fast pacing does not make an anime bad. \\n\\n\r\nArt: This is one area i have to give my props. I will admit there are some instances where the art is not the best it could be, however, overall i think that this anime is well done in the art department and they strive to make a good impression. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Ok so this is something i often don't pay much attention to when it comes to anime unless i am just flooded by amazing musical scores or awful dubbing and irritating sounds that exist for no reason. I rated this relatively high because the dubbing (japanese) was done well and the music was quite nice. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ok so this one was a bit underwhelming for me if i'm being fair. I loved the characters in this anime, but overall you don't see an insane amount of development from any characters. They pretty much go with the pacing of a slice of life that has little to no drama at all. This does not however mean that the characters have zero development. Development aside they have fun personalities, and each of them is quite unique. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: LOL so this category is almost pointless to be honest. Though i understand why it exists. This anime was fun and just wholesome for me. It was something different and the characters themselves made things worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: So you can assume my thoughts based on everything above. This anime is not ACTION PACKED or some fantasy isekai that will have you vying for magical blasts and high end spells. It is one that does not take itself too seriously but still leaves room to take you along for the right. Again this anime has it's own style of pacing and is not quick to throw you into this world. This story though is very fun and genuinely interesting to just see the characters daily interactions. It might not be the most exciting anime ever but it's still worth the watch.",

In several places I found it tedious to keep looking at her so I had to end uplooking at one chapter a day.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is fine, to be an anime somewhat recent meets what it should and the characters are a lot like manga, it may be the strongest point of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack is not bad, a well animated Opening and with a somewhat sticky musical theme, the ending is calm and characteristic of a Slice of Life. The background sounds that set the story are also correct.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters I did not like, the protagonist of the anime never managed to transmit the interest for what happens in history and many of the secondary characters appear just one chapter giving the impression that they are there for \"obligation.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I can not say that it was wrong but I really expected much more from this anime. If you just start looking at the genre of Slice of Life there might be some better options so you do not end up hating this genre after looking at Flying Witch.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI used to practice magic tricks with cards a lot when I was a kid.\r\nI wasn\u2019t very good at it, but I could do a few. Double-flipping, \u201cstories,\u201d rigged decks. It was fun trying to trick my family members, seeing their bewildered faces as I did something seemingly impossible. Something that only magic could account for.\r\nFlying Witch does not have card tricks, but it does have lots of magic \u2013 of a different kind.\r\nSTORY\r\nOn one unassuming day in April, Makoto, a witch-in-training, arrives in a new town where her relatives live. Her purpose? To betterher witch knowledge and abilities. Thankfully for her, the day to day happenings lend themselves to magical opportunities. And thus Flying Witch proceeds.\\n\\n\r\nThis proceeding is nothing like work or routine. The anime is, after all, an \u201ciyashikei\u201d (or \u201chealing\u201d) show. Meaning, its contents are heavily designed to be easy, soulful, and happy in nature.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is what the audience gets. Makoto hangs out with Chinatsu and Kei, Akane and Inukai, Nao and Anzu. She takes part in simple yet soothing activities, like finding herbs in a forest or pruning apple trees.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting also aides in Flying Witch\u2019s healing capabilities. The small, quiet town is not boisterous with the clamoring of cars and bustling venues. Instead, it invites a feeling of nostalgia, a sense that this spot is tucked away from other parts of the world. Their home houses all the \u201caction,\u201d but its open doors, small farm, and simple d\u00e9cor create comfort with ease.\\n\\n\r\nEven the anime\u2019s comedic moments are reserved. Nao says to Chito (Makoto\u2019s black cat) that she seems to have gained weight, so she jumps on Nao\u2019s back and lightly taps Nao\u2019s forehead with her tail. The anime does not aim for huge laughs on purpose since that would defeat its healing agenda.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, one cannot forget about the magic, for it is implied in the title. And, unsurprisingly and surprisingly, magic ends up being the most important part of the show and the least important part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, magic being the most important. Throughout the season, the anime showcases many magical events. Summoning a murder of crows with Akane\u2019s help. Turning Inukai from a dog-girl into a full-fledged dog. Revealing a ghostly waitress through Makoto\u2019s drawn circle.\\n\\n\r\nIt must be noted that these magics are not flashy whatsoever. While these are some of the more obvious moments, Makoto levitating or speaking with Chito are just as magical. No matter how normal the anime (rightly) depicts them.\\n\\n\r\nSince these non-flashy magics coincide with the iyashikei tone of the show, they also bring about some of the best moments that the anime offers. Hiding caf\u00e9s, flying whales, and glowing fish are not possible, but, precisely because they are magic within a non-magic world, they stand out as a wonder to behold.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, magic being the least important. In many of the scenes, magic plays no role at all. Makoto, Chinatsu, and Kei get their picture taken by a kind old lady passing by. Nao does her best to cook food during their cooking class. Chito walks the same route two different times.\\n\\n\r\nJust as it was with the flashiness of the magic, it must be noted how mundane these events are. Picking radishes and making hotcakes aren\u2019t life-altering events. But they demonstrate that life really is just that: a series of simple yet personable moments.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, it\u2019s not the otherworldly people that visit the caf\u00e9; it\u2019s the good luck that a pair of romantic ladybugs bring. It\u2019s not that there are fish that swim in the ground; it\u2019s the serendipitous glow of those fish in the nighttime sky. It\u2019s not the giant flying whale; it\u2019s the peaceful ruins of a civilization long since gone on its back.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, when the magic and non-magic are combined, the show\u2019s main message reveals itself: The truly magical moments are the ones that have been \u201cnearby\u201d all along.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does have small faults when it does not take advantage of some of its elements. The father gets sidelined hard, the Harbinger of Spring only shows up once (despite having a dancing part in the OP sequence), and Chinatsu\u2019s whole witch apprenticeship (let alone Makoto\u2019s own training) does not see a conclusion. Again, these are not deal-breakers, but they do stick out as odd narrative choices.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, Flying Witch\u2019s tone and its message carry it as far as any broom could. That is to say, pretty far.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch does not try to dazzle its audience, but what it provides is a lot of prettiness over the course of the season.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially in its backgrounds. Dense forests, a quaint caf\u00e9, and a nighttime shot of some cherry trees are detailed in both lighting and depiction. Even more importantly, their soft colors and simplicity further evoke a feeling of calm. Perfect for this healing anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn particular, the plants do the most work. Trees, flowers, bushes, herbs, and grass play a major part in making the show a peaceful, nature-filled hub. And since green is often associated with health and healing, the focus on greenery only furthers the anime\u2019s goals.\\n\\n\r\nEven the town itself, with its roads, parks, and buildings, show off how pretty the anime can look. It\u2019s a location revisited multiple times \u2013 much like Kei\u2019s family\u2019s house \u2013 but it never ceases to feel inviting to walk within.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs go for simplicity as well. And rightly so, for these characters are just that: simple, everyday people. Makoto\u2019s long black hair, emerald eyes, and yellow cardigan simultaneously don\u2019t stand out but make her the center of attention. Akane\u2019s dark complexion contrasts with her white hair, giving her a foreign look. And Kei may as well be a background townsperson (in a good way) for how unassuming he dresses.\\n\\n\r\nTheir various outfits, like Makoto\u2019s pigtails and Chinatsu\u2019s overalls, mix up how they usually look, adding even more strength to their designs.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the more magical-looking designs deserve a mention. Inukai\u2019s dog transformation, the Harbinger of Spring\u2019s mask, and the paper man\u2019s all-black attire. Indeed, their contrast with the normal, simplistic world Flying Witch presents makes their designs that much more intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nThe show even employs reaction faces. They are subdued, often slight expressions of shock or bewilderment, bringing small moments of laughter yet keeping the show from going over the top in its delivery.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real issue art-wise comes in the actual animation. The backgrounds and the designs receive the most attention, so the characters\u2019 movement sadly does not. Most of the time, Makoto and the others are just sitting around the living-room table or chatting on a bus. Some more interesting segments exist, like when Makoto flies on her broom for the first time or when she\u2019s chasing a pheasant, but these scenes are quite uncommon.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, the unmoving nature of the characters fits Flying Witch. After all, less movement means more calm, and more calm means more peace, and more peace means more healing. Still, their lack of movement is noticeable, and it is enough to make the anime feel rigid rather than fun.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWith an anime like Flying Witch, it\u2019s difficult to judge their characters in the traditional sense. The episodic format, the lighthearted, no-drama stories, and the lack of any character conflicts make Makoto and the other characters nothing more than themselves from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nNot that that\u2019s a bad thing. Because (again) with an anime like Flying Witch, it makes sense that the characters do not change. In fact, it\u2019s almost thematic. Just as the story brings healing through showcasing the mundane parts of life, simplicity of character adds its own brand of healing: nostalgia, familiarity, and ease.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the problem with this approach is that it doesn\u2019t leave the characters in what one would call a memorable light. Remember Kei\u2019s design? His personality is just as dull. That\u2019s not his fault; he\u2019s simply being himself. He likes watching movies which makes him relatable, sure, but that does not make him a very interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nSame idea for Akane, Chinatsu, and even Makoto. The older sister drinks a lot, Chinatsu acts like a cute kid, and Makoto gets lost easily. But, because they lack so much on a character level (besides some niche traits like Makoto overproducing food or Chinatsu disliking bitter plants), they end up as little more than placeholders.\\n\\n\r\nYet, that\u2019s arguably the point. Kei reading a book in his room, Akane sleeping the afternoons away, and Makoto complaining about how the broom hurts her groin are not stellar character developments. But, much like the story and its portrayal of \u201cmagic,\u201d these more simplistic aspects go right along with the show\u2019s motif.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, what makes them characters, makes them people, are not flashy occurrences but rather the everyday details that the audience can more than empathize with.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, the cast have their own roles to play when it comes to magic itself.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more obvious is Chinatsu. She\u2019s a kid, so something like magic and what it can do has an even greater effect on her. As such, she embodies the wonder of magic.\\n\\n\r\nAkane is the most experienced and often hailed as a fantastic witch (by her own sister). Yet the magics she performs \u2013 creating animal-morphing chocolates, desaturating a landscape \u2013 show how much silliness and fun that magic can bring. So, she proves that magic does not have to be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto does not act like those folktale witches. She doesn\u2019t have a crooked nose or green skin, and she doesn\u2019t toil over a bubbling cauldron. (At least, not a big one.) Instead, she\u2019s a sweet, kind girl who enjoys the outdoors, loves her family, and talks with her cat. In other words, she pushes back against the typical magic-user tropes \u2013 by being the complete opposite.\\n\\n\r\nEven Kei has his role. He\u2019s a very quiet, very normal dude. He does not speak much let alone react to anything with more than mild amusement. In fact, the only time he seems to show any emotion is when spooky ghosts are involved. Thus, he demonstrates that magic is not something to be fearful of.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, the characters are not the most impressive. However, they at least have these roles and a more thematic argument at hand, giving them a bit more strength than they otherwise had.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nTwo pieces of music stand out from the others in Flying Witch: the opening track and the main track from the OST.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP generates a lot of fun. The vocalist\u2019s \u201cSha la la la\u2026\u201d followed by the quicker lyrics gets at that immediately with their shortness and silliness. The clapping in the background doesn\u2019t just go along with the beat; it\u2019s something that\u2019s easy to clap to. And the guitar flourish, played near the beginning and right at the end, is a catchy little arrangement that starts and finalizes the track on a bunch of happy notes.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe main track\u201d sounds vague, but it\u2019s obvious which one it is. It starts with a simple acoustic guitar before gently wading into some light piano work. The piano itself jumps around in a calm manner \u2013 all while the guitar continues playing in the background. The beat the combo produces becomes a leitmotif that many of the other tracks use, getting at (once again) that familiarity and therefore healing feeling.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does have other tracks, like those steeped in woodwind instruments or only relying on that acoustic guitar. They\u2019re not as powerful as the leitmotif, but they have their own sense of simplicity that evoke similar feelings.\\n\\n\r\nOn the lower end of the sound department are the ending track and a particular voice-acting job.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED goes for a slower pace with both Makoto and Chinatsu singing individually and together. It\u2019s a more reserved piece, aiming for a bittersweet tone that it mostly achieves. It takes a few listens to warm up to it, and it\u2019s not necessarily a poorly composed piece. But with a loud middle section and a grander scale that does not mesh well with the rest of this laidback show, it does not hold up as well as the other tracks offered.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, there are two people worth mentioning. Minami Shinoda, in her first major role as Makoto, does very well as the kindhearted girl. However, Eri Suzuki as Chinatsu doesn\u2019t quite hit the mark. She sounds more annoying than cute. Especially her \u201cYay,\u201d which seems to come from an adult trying to sound like a kid rather than it does a kid naturally brimming with excitement. (She\u2019s technically the former, but the latter was the desired intention.)\\n\\n\r\n(One other small shout-out goes to the voice behind the mandrake plant. His constant \u201cooooooooooooooooo\u201d while Makoto and Nao were talking and afterwards made for a very funny scene.)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI have a couple of favorite moments from the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the first being the trick-and-treat episode. Watching Makoto cry at everything, Chinatsu laugh at everything, and then Chinatsu laughing at Makoto crying made for a hilarious scene.\\n\\n\r\nI also really liked when Akane mistook Nao to be Kei\u2019s girlfriend. She started crawling on the ground, making encouraging sounds and gestures as she egged on Kei and left the room.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond these couple of scenes, though, I was merely content with the anime. Another way to put it, I neither hated nor loved it.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of that falls on the characters. They didn\u2019t have much of a personality beyond just being nice to one another. Chinatsu could be silly, Akane could be lazy, and Inukai could be angry, but they were all a bit too plain.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that it must be this way. If everyone was shouting or had explosive personalities, they would not fit with the laidback atmosphere. And it\u2019s not like they are unlikable characters. They are nice and happy and fun. I just would have preferred more out of them.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, Makoto was my favorite of the bunch. Her smile while holding that mandrake, her surprised face when a crow landed on her head, and her energy when in the forest made me very happy to see.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the paper man. He was a cool and ominous dude. Too bad he was only around for maybe twenty seconds tops.\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch may not do a whole lot, but its heart is in the right place. The story\u2019s message is meaningful, the art is pretty, and the characters serve specific roles. It\u2019s a simple show \u2013 and that\u2019s no card trick.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, healing and \u201cmagical\u201d moments make for a heartwarming experience\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, pretty background art, healing greenery, nice character designs, subdued comedic reactions, and okay actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, while the cast lack any outstanding qualities, their everyday selves and roles in relation to magic give them at least some strength\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, good OST, okay ED, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, not much entices besides a fun character or moment here and there\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "Flying Witch uses it's subtle setting, light comedy, and simple yet likeable cast to ease viewers with an unwinding aura that relaxes the soul.\r\nBeing the slice of life lover I am, I felt Flying Witch captures the theme of the genre well and just lets the characters be themselves without worrying about carrying a story.  I am usually the kind of viewer that comes into most anime (hyped or sidelined) with minimal expectations and I was not disappointed at all with this one.\r\nThe story is nonexistent but it's mainly about a witch who moves in with her cousins and continues to live a normallife while studying magic.  They go on small adventures (and get's lost in them sometimes) and approach the small things in life while laying in some comedic moments using the magical themes.  Flying Witch does a very good job at keeping its composure and the atmosphere is constantly slow yet calming.  Where the show excelled at was using the atmosphere it gave as some form of indentification like it knew what it wanted to be, what it wanted to achieve, and that the makers of the show will not be attempt to go further and will lose sight becoming something it's not.  It remains simple throughout but manages to present it's moments of beauty very quietly with a sense of wonder.  It also presented a proper balance between the average slice of life-life and the fantasy aspects of being a witch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nothing complex or nothing the most fascinating.  But that beats being annoying, loud, and having high-pitched voices forcing their cuteness on the viewers since they are unconfident on what the anime has to offer.  The cast keeps things very simple and interacts with each other staying true to themselves like they are real people.  The characters ranged from interesting, subtle, humorous, and just overall held up the happy mood.\\n\\n\r\nI found the artstyle beautiful and the animation was solid throughout.  The cinematography was also excellent making the most out of what it could display with its multiple scenes of nature and the countryside environment.  The opening is nothing much but I didn't feel like skipping over that at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does not try to be flashy but it's just normal.  Sometimes that's all an anime needs to be for somebody to enjoy it without having to watch through the parts of anime they hate such as troupes and cliches.  If you like slow, nature-focused slice of life like Non Non Biyori, you should totally give this a checkout.  Flying Witch gets a thumbs up and a 7/10.",

            "content": "Are you tired of all the action on mainstream anime? Then give this show a shot. It's calm, serene, relaxing, and... well, that's it.\r\nJudging from the title, you'd probably think it has magic and such. Well, you're not wrong. It does indeed have magic for it contained magical characters like witches and fortune tellers and such. However, instead of them using magic for fighting and whatnot, it's used in their daily life, something very rare for fantasy-based anime.\r\nWhat I liked most about the series is that it doesn't try so hard to be a comedy. It's just one of those feel-good anime which you watchsimply for its relaxing mood. The plot revolves around witches and other magical beings in their everyday lives, so there's no serious plot to be analyzed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are too... normal. They don't really stand out much because... well, they're basically just people living their daily lives, only they have magic. Don't get me wrong, they're not bad characters. They just don't have enough \"depth\" in their personality. But perhaps it's just me expecting too much from a feel-good show.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I like, though, it's the art style. The presentation of serenity is shown clearly, letting you know that it's not a serious anime. It's colorful and light, and it doesn't force itself to be artsy, it just is.\\n\\n\r\nSo are you stressed out by all the magic anime? Then I recommend you watch flying witch. Before you know it, you'll be flying in cloud nine.",

Wrap up in your blanket, grab something warm to drink, and enjoy this serene look at small city living in Japan. \r\nDon't expect crazy mahou shoujo super powers or power-up battles. The \"witch\" elements are quite tame and are mostly designed as a way to generate the plot or dialogue of each episode. Makoto and her sister are inspired by classic European witch mythology with an interesting fusion of Japanese culture. Surprisingly, this all blends seamlessly with the rural-ish setting of the series.\r\nThe show is competently executed in all aspects. I haveno complaints other than perhaps it simply followed a tried and true path and didn't push any artistic boundaries or attempt anything particularly stunning. Given the point of the show, I really don't hold that against it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an episodic show, so if you have a requirement for your anime to have a overarching story arc you won't find it here. I generally prefer series that have a story, but I would encourage people like me to give this show a try if you're looking for something lighthearted and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10. Solid execution in every way. This gets an extra point purely on how cozy it is. It was an excellent stress reliever. \\n\\n\r\n(Side note: I'm a beginner closing on intermediate level Japanese learner. I found this show very useful for practicing my Japanese because it fills one of the more uncommon niches in anime--a slice of life focused on the interactions of a family unit. Mother, father, sister, brother, and cousins are all represented and you can get a good amount of listening practice and hear some more typical and less \"anime\" dialogue.)",

Because this is the first slice of life anime that I felt attached to, so it is a shame that the anime only consist of 12 episode. So, after I binged all the episodes, I binged the manga as well. I can say that both manga and anime are great, but I was amazed by how the storiesin the anime are \u2018rearranged\u2019 from the manga while not hurting the main strories. Also, the addition of trivial things apart from the manga makes the anime version livelier and the characters more connected to each other. In this case J.C Staff has done a great job of adapting the manga.\\n\r\nI\u2019ve watched another great slice of life anime such as K-ON!, Usagi Drop, Demi-Chan Wa Kataritai (Interview with the monster girls), and Sora no Wo To (Sound of The Sky). What makes Flying Witch really stand out from the others is the fact that this anime has succesfully build the calm, warm, and peaceful feeling after watching each episode. It may be a little exaggerating, but I would say that this is the holy grail of slice of life anime. Everything done in the right way in the right dose. The animation is not as great as other anime in the same season, but it fits the atmosphere of the anime. The background art takes you deep to the beauty of Hirosaki region in Aomori.  The characters really support how the stories goes and felt like a real person, not self-inserted characters, not artificially made characters, not a moe blob, not overly cute, not someone who is stubbornly determined to achieve something in his/her life, overly funny, or -deres type characters. The story is the one which held strongest point in this anime, despite the lack of main plot, every episode have certain connection of cause and effect to other episodes. What I really like is how the anime/manga makes the magic somehow believable. There are no flashy magic, the magic here is done like chemistry or making herbs that has to be done in the right amount or else the result won\u2019t come as expected. The soundtrack of this anime besides the opening, is not really  memorable but it is not bad either. The opening itself is good enough so I decided to download it to my phone.\\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend this anime for all anime audience, young or old, newcomers or veterans.\\n\r\nINDONESIAN REVIEW.\\n\r\nSaya harus menulis sebuah review yang baik mengenai anime ini, agar dunia tahu bahwa anime ini terlalu bagus untuk dilewatkan. Inilah pertama kalinya saya merasakan keterikatan terhadap sebuah anime slice of life. Sayangnya, hanya terdapat 12 episode. Jadi, setelah saya habiskan ke-dua belas episodenya, saya langsung habiskan manganya juga. Bisa saya katakan bahwa keduanya bagus. Hanya saja saya merasa kagum dengan versi anime-nya. Sebab, cerita yang disajikan di anime ini diubah urutannya agar terasa lebih pas, tanpa merusak pesan utama yang ingin disampaikan. Selain itu penambahan beberapa hal kecil yang tidak diceritakan dalam versi manga-nya membuat keseluruhan anime ini terasa lebih utuh dan koheren. Dalam hal ini studio J.C Staff berhasil menjalankan tugasnya dengan baik.\\n\r\nSebelumnya saya juga sudah menonton anime slice of life yang menurut saya bagus, seperti K-On!, Usagi Drop, Demi-chan wa kataritai, dan Sora no Wo To. Namun, yang membuat Flying Witch menonjol adalah kenyataan bahwa anime ini berhasil membuat penonton merasa tenang dan damai setelah menonton tiap episode-nya. Meski agak berlebihan saya berani mengatakan bahwa anime ini adalah anime slice of life pamungkas. Semuanya dilakukan dan diselesaikan dengan cara yang tepat dan jumlah yang tepat. Animasinya tidak sehalus anime-anime lain di musim yang sama, tapi kualitas animasinya pas untuk anime ini. Selain itu background art-nya dilakukan dengan baik sehingga seakan-akan membawa penonton ke Hirosaki, Aomori, daerah yang menjadi latar anime ini. Tokoh-tokohnya terasa seperti orang asli, bukan tipe-tipe karakter moe, -dere, atau jenis-jenis karakter streotipikal anime yang laku dipasaran. Jika anda mengerti maksud saya. Dari segi cerita, anime ini memegang kekuatan utama.  Satu hal yang paling saya suka dari anime ini adalah bagaimana sihir yang dilakukan terkesan nyata, tidak bombastis seperti Harry Potter atau anime-anime sihir yang lain. Disini, sihir dilakukan seperti percobaan reaksi kimia atau membuat jamu, semua harus dilakukan dengan takaran yang pas, jika tidak hasil tidak akan seperti yang diharapkan. Untuk musik latar sendiri tidak ada yang istimewa, namun untuk musik pembukanya menurut saya cukup bagus untuk saya cari dan saya unduh di HP saya.\\n\r\nSecara keseluruhan, saya sangat menyarankan para penikmat anime dari segala usia untuk menyaksikan anime yang satu ini. Akan sangat disayangkan apabila anda melewatkan anime yang satu ini.\\n",

            "content": "***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW***\r\nFlying Witch pulls off the unthinkable feat of matching the serene and relaxing feel of Aria. It matches almost every aspect of Aria while improving in certain areas.\r\nNOTE: The reason I am going to compare this show to Aria is because they both borrow the same mechanics to make their slow-paced show so amazing. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nSlice-of-Life anime usually fall into the issue of not having a driving plot force throughout the show. This was somewhat prevalent in Aria's first season but was less of an issue in season 2 and 3. In Flying Witch there is almost no plot directionbetween episodes. Some characters show up in later episodes but there really is no driving plot force in this show. This might be a plus for some people who like the episodic type shows (Like Mushishi and Cowboy Bebop) but I personally like there to be a connection from each episode to the next (even if it is a very small one). Tamako Market is another Slice-of-Life anime does a decent job of connecting each episode to one another so the payoff is much better in the end. Because of these reasons, I find that Flying Witch is lacking in the plot department. I love what I am seeing but it is due to the other elements of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch flat out looks gorgeous every frame of the show. The character's expressions, the color, the backgrounds, everything looks very spot on. I felt that the animation was a little off in certain scenes but overall the show did very well in the visual performance department.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show nailed it home for me. Like with Aria, the music and ambient sounds are 100% perfect. The backing music in every scene fits perfectly and enhances what you are seeing ten-fold. This is one of those shows that you should absolutely go out and get the OST. Not only the supporting music but the ambient sounds were spot on. The wind whistling in the background, the birds chirping, just everything audio wise made this anime feel like it was in a rural Japanese town. Lastly the voice cast was simply amazing. They nailed the dead-pan comedy parts and did an amazing job relaying their character's personalities.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's honestly hard to find any real issues with the cast in this show. They all feel incredibly unique and interact with each other so fluidly. Every scene that has a character interacting with another character(s) was just such a joy to watch. It is because of this key aspect that this show works so well; it is not a plot driven show but a character driven one instead. This is the same for Kiznaiver which did a very good job of allowing its characters to drive the show. If the cast is well-knit enough they will carry the show. It is one of the few things that can override a boring plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason this category is not getting a full 10/10 is because unlike in Aria there isn't a whole lot of character growth going on in Flying Witch. The show does the same thing as Aria showing the daily lives of a small cast but it does not show each character striving for a specific goal and achieving it. This might not be a fair complaint since Aria has three seasons and a OVA while Flying Witch only has this one season but I just do not see where the character growth is going to occur within this cast in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a fantastic Slice-of-Life anime that you should absolutely put on your \u201cWant to Watch\u201d list right now. It takes a slow, laid back approach to show to you the calm and serene features of this rural Japanese town while the cast helps provide the show with some genuine funny moments. If you are someone who cannot stand slow-paced shows then maybe skip out on this one but regardless you should give the first episode a try.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.9/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Flying witch. There isn't much to cover so this will be brief. It a very relaxing and cute show. \r\nThe story revolves around a witch named Makoto, who is a witch. She has come of age, but do to her parents wish to finish school has gone to live with her cousins. Nothing really interesting happens, no real action, or mini plot points. This is both a strength and a weakness for the show imo. It creates this relaxing and non intrusive mood to the show. However it also seems to be alot of missed potential. Charactersare introduced, situations are created, magic is discussed and used, and not only does nothing come from it but it also never seems to get brought back up. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was very pretty and colorful. The soundtrack is very catchy, and even though not usually my taste is now on my playlist.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were interesting enough, but like I said above nothing comes from it. Makoto the young witch who is bad with directions has plenty of personality, but doesn't really shine. Other witches are introduced and shelved and only brought out for a quick glance here and there. The cousin and the rest of the family only seemed to exist for small comic relief. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show overall. However pure slice of life shows like this are not to my taste. This one in particular is particularly dry do to it having zero drive. No characters stand out, the story or even the theme of the show not even remotely discussed, no mini events take place...etc. Normally this would make me rate a show poorly but it did a great job in being an escape that I think it hit what it was trying aim for.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Nothing to the show really. Watch if you like dryer than normal slice of life shows. It is cute and relaxing, also has great art and soundtrack.",

            "content": "In the bustling cacophony that is daily life, sitting down and relaxing doesn't particularly come easy.  In this dog eat dog world that we live in rampant with all sorts of negative occurrences that pop up without warning, it's important to set aside such stressful moments and enjoy something that is quieter or less hectic, and enjoy the magic that is the casual, everyday life.\r\nStory: Kowata Makoto is a witch in-training who comes to Aomori, a rural area of Japan that is far away from the usual bustle of city life to live with her cousin and his relatives as she journeys to becomea full-fledged witch.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile it doesn't look like it from the outside, the majority and beauty of Flying Witch is its simplicity and its rather basic nature.  Every episode has Makoto and various characters in the series experience different and sometimes magical events around town that offer a new adventure with just a touch of whimsy to each and every one.  None of these so-called adventures are extremely outlandish with most of them pertaining to simple, everyday tasks like going to the store, spending time with others at home, or even just going out for a walk with only a very small amount of them being somewhat extreme in terms of what the adventuring is.  But what really separates this show from other similar concepts is the execution and unique flair that the show adds to it.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show is also about witches and the supernatural in order to add that one little touch of whimsy to the series, the show very often showcases magic and other magical attributes associated with witches.  However, the magic in the show is extremely subtle, similar to magic in the real world.  There're no dramatic spells or effects, with the biggest thing to come out of actual magic in this series being just a small little poof if anything.  This subtlety adds to the overall feel of the show to make it seem as though that even real life events can be magical regardless of how mundane they can be.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only real downside that I can see with this show is the fact that this show is extremely atmospheric.  While the story aspect and overall feel of the series is what drives it to become this whimsical everyday tale that it is, the calm and gentle atmosphere has very often been the problem for many people who want something to 'happen' as some have stated.  The show doesn't really have any high points nor does it have any low points.  It's a slice of life series that pertains to the life of a young witch living in a rural town, so it's a kind of show that sadly, doesn't really appeal to everybody.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, Flying Witch still holds its merit for being a wonderful show due to its calm and beautiful atmosphere to give it this individual feel to it.  The show kept its own pace and delivered what they wanted to do each episode.  In fact, I come out of the series feeling like I didn't even watch enough of the show because I was smiling throughout the whole episode and was so engrossed in this gentle world that the episode ended just right after I started it.  Even with me watching the OP and ED every episode, every episode just felt too short.  That's how you can tell that it's a good show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Simple and whimsical atmosphere\\n\r\n+ Even pacing\\n\r\n+ Subtlety in all aspects to pertain it to real life\\n\r\n-  Gentle atmosphere has been known to make people despise this show\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in Flying Witch are what could be described as normal people in a sense.  While yes, there are a few outlandish/mythical characters and the main character is technically a witch, the majority of the cast aren't these exaggerated and overdone character tropes, but just simple rural people that enjoy the simpler things in life.\\n\\n\r\nFirst there's Kowata Makoto.  A directionally challenged witch in-training, Makoto is the main character of the series who spends the majority of time in the series like all of the other characters, living their quite lives out in the countryside.  However, beyond this, Makoto doesn't particularly have any other traits to her.  Beyond what is established, Makoto doesn't really change much in ways of character development in the series and are more or less introduced to new things rather than grow as a person.  She, like the rest of the cast are very simple characters that don't have too much to them.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Kuramoto Chinatsu, Makoto's younger cousin who is introduced to the world of witches.  Chinatsu is a bright, energetic, and adventurous elementary schooler who finds fascination in the world of witches, often times being shown the magic and/or parts of the witch world.  She sort of plays the audience in the series as she, like the audience, are being shown these whimsical things that add a bit of spice to the series.  \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in the series more or less play the part of going along with the ride.  I chose to weed out Makoto and Chinatsu specifically because they both get the most screentime.  In actuality, all of the characters play similar parts to these two girls by just being characters that go along with the ebb and flow of the series and live out whatever event that is going on at the time whether it'd be the unique task of the day or meeting someone new.  As such, these characters don't really feel like characters so much as they feel like the ones on stage who are showing us, the audience what new thing that they're going to do for us today.  They add to the atmosphere rather than being what the show is about, so the characters fall flat a bit in that sense. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Characters aren't tropes but feel like people\\n\r\n-  The story drives the characters rather than the other way around\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by J.C. Staff, a company that has had both its ups and its downs, Flying Witch is one of their projects that got a substantial budget and got a very good treatment in terms of the quality of its production.  The overall color scheme is bright and cheerful, with the show boasting high quality and production art that was breathtaking to look at.  And the water looked like REAL WATER.  (Do you know how hard it is to animate good water?)\\n\\n\r\nI think what really made the art for Flying Witch just exceed expectations is the fact that virtually every location that was drawn and animated for the series was based off of a real-life location.  Every background that was made for the series was an almost 1:1 comparison to the real world location and that to me is not only mind-boggling, but just shows the dedication and the lengths and the effort that was taken to make this series so pretty.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for character designs, the show boasts a moe style that leans towards realism rather than an 18 year old girl looking 10.  The characters still have relatively big eyes and cute appearance, especially since the majority of the cast is female, but the characters looked more like their actual age than opposed to what other shows have done.  However, if you're not a fan of the moe artstyle, than this might still be a bit of a tougher watch for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Excellent, high-quality art\\n\r\n+ Wonderfully made backgrounds\\n\r\n+/- Moe artstyle for character designs\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Ah, yes, the OST.  The OST brings just so much joy to this series.  Adding into the calm and gentle atmosphere for the series, the soundtrack for Flying Witch utilizes several key instruments like piano, acoustic guitar, bell, flute, and clarinet to give it that airy and whimsical sound like a gentle breeze to add to the already pleasant atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nFor its OP, we have \"Sharararan\", an OP that I NEVER skipped.  The OP is this extremely happy and cheerful opening that I always had the urge to clap to every time I heard it.  It's the kind of feel good song that you can't help but smile to or dance along to just because of how catchy it is.  \\n\\n\r\nIts ED, Nichijou no Mahou, is a gentle and quieter song sung by Makoto and Chinatsu's seiyuus that acts as the quieter night to Sharararan's sort of morning feel.  It's a good song, but compared to the other tracks in the show's OST, it doesn't compare or stack up to everything else that's there in the OST.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Overall, wonderful OST\\n\r\n+ Catchy clap-along to OP\\n\r\n-  ED kind of lags behind a bit.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  Flying Witch is a series that I never thought I would find myself addicted to.  At first glance, I knew that the show was going to be pretty good just because of the amount of time and effort that J.C. Staff put into it, and their track record when it came to devoting an entire seasonal or at least most of the budget into one show.  But I never expected myself to be so enveloped in such a calm and gentle feeling that only left me wanting more.  After finishing it, I'm a bit at a loss for words cause I quite honestly want more of this series.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  Despite the fact that there are some people who absolutely despise this series for being 'boring', I for one is one of those people who enjoys those kinds of 'boring' shows.  Every episode gave me something new to engross myself with, and hell, if you can make a show have a cat, just a normal cat, be as interesting or even more so than her human cast members, then you're doing something right.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I have is the lack of elaboration on the characters in the series.  The characters aren't really that deep and really only have 1-2 traits to them because the story is the one that carries the majority of the series.  But in all honesty, I both didn't notice nor cared about that throughout the run of the series simply because of how much I loved seeing Chinatsu or Makoto going through their daily lives or discovering something new.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a nice, calm show to watch, then Flying Witch is definitely something that should be on your plan to watch list.  If you're a fan of more story-driven or action-based shows, I would say to stay away from this.  My problem with a lot of the hate with this series is the fact that the people who despise this series don't really appreciate the idea of atmospheric shows, so they don't innately understand the qualities of what makes this genre so enjoyable since all they see is a bunch of cute girls running around doing generic stuff. That's fine, since not everybody has to like the same things, but I would highly suggest that if you do not like shows that don't particularly have a plotline, or just don't like slice of life shows in general, don't watch this.  You will not have as fun of a time that I had watching this.  I guarantee it.",

            "content": "I already knew what kind of anime Flying Witch was supposed to be when I started watching it, a cute and funny show to relax with.\r\nStory & Character: Easily the worst part of this show is the story, by which I mean, there basically is none. You have a girl who is a witch and has to study witchcraft on her own. It is very calm and the plot is simple, too simple. Nothing ever happens, all witchcraft is reduced to pathetically simple and boring acts that, I guess, are supposed to be funny. The characters are bland and boring, and just as nothing happensin the story, nothing happens in terms of them developing. There's a lot of \"cute\" and \"funny\" or \"heartwarming\" things in Flying Witch, but they ultimately feel very forced and unnatural.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The art is probably the best part of the show, with gentle colors and characters that are easy on the eyes, but it's not far above normal in today's standards (the mc girl looks like the girl from Bakuman). The Sound is pretty normal.\\n\r\nOverall: In the beginning I liked the show, but as it went on the forced cuteness (and so on), combined with the fact that nothing ever happened made it grow more and more boring until I, after the 8th episode, couldn't take it anymore and dropped it. It might be your cup of coffee, but it definitely isn't mine. Decide at your own peril ;-)",

            "content": "This is one show I keep coming back to, because the cast of characters is well-written and funny, and the world is relaxing and beautiful.\r\nReal-world, historical magic and witchcraft are often depicted as misunderstood powers of young women, where politically powerful men feel threatened by them. Often in Japan, someone who is \"weird\" or \"different\" is quickly turned into a target for bullying and isolation. Flying Witch does neither with its witchcraft: it's not a massively powerful set of abilities like in countless magical girl shows or The Ancient Magus Bride, and the community in this little corner of Aomori is surprisingly accepting of thesequirky young women who can fly on brooms. Witches in this world try their best to do good with their abilities, which is cool because it would quickly become a very different anime otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not 100% familiar with Wiccan customs and rituals, but it seems to me that the original artist and the anime production crew did their homework here (or at least, made it look convincing). The only category of ritual the show doesn't delve into is curses and hexes, which is good because, again, seeing one performed might transform the show into something else.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does a great job of capturing the idyllic beauty of rural Japan. Well, not quite as rural as Non Non Biyori, but you get to see nature much more than in metropolitan Tokyo or Osaka (yes, I know, there's places like Ueno Park and the Imperial palace, but those are heavily managed).\\n\\n\r\nThis cast is very well-written and directed. Makoto is a sweet yet slightly clumsy heroine, Chinatsu can light up anyone's day, Kei is a fantastic foil to both (with good deadpan lines), Akane is great comic relief fodder, Nao and Inukai are great tsukkomi girls, and the parents are cool with just about anything. Even the cats provide good comedy in the style of R2-D2 (and I just learned Ai Kayano voiced Chito, so that's cool).\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the music. For the most part it's either synth with a really good instrument set or studio musicians, and the one recurring theme is Makoto's. One track uses woodwinds to gently lead up to the introduction of Makoto floating on her new broom, another uses pizzicato strings to accompany a humorous vignette. The opening theme is cheerful and fun, though for some reason the characters are leading an odd syncopated clapping in the refrain.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is great if you want to kick back and watch happy anime.",

            "content": "Makoto is a witch in training who moves in with her relatives to further her training. If you're looking for a true slice of life with a light sprinkling of magic, Flying Witch may be up your alley. It shares the feel-good family interactions seen in shows like Minami Ke. However, it lacks a comical equivalent of Kana and doesn't have any semblance of romance. This show literally goes nowhere. If you're like me and need some semblance of story or character development, you're better off looking elsewhere.\r\nAnimation:\r\nThis show has some pretty impressive, detailed backgrounds. Whether in a local pedestrian mall, a garage shed, orwalking outdoors, the characters are surrounded by vivid, meticulously-drawn scenery. If you like majestic mountains, green crop fields, and rustic towns, then this is your kind of scenery. Backgrounds aside, the show is standard fare. It's drawn in a bright but low-saturated palette, which fits the peaceful yet plain feel of the story. There is your standard fare 3D CGI used in all the vehicles and trains but luckily they're only used in a few scenes. The characters themselves are well drawn but actually look humorously plain sometimes compared to the detailed scenery. The show involves a lot of spiritual beings visiting the household so expect some rather odd looking characters- your reactions will probably be similar to that of Chinatsu. I actually think the best drawn character here is actually the cat Chito, who seems to have more personality than our rather boring male cousin, Kei.\\n\\n\r\nThere is pretty much no action in this rather peaceful show. Likewise, despite there being a witch on a broom in a miniskirt, the camera keeps things clean.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe light, guitar-backed op fits both the scenery and pacing of the show; it's a fair and relatively catchy melody. The ED, by contrast, has a much richer instrumentation and is sung by our main heroines. The BGM is rather playful in tonality, it relies heavily on brass instruments, plucked strings, and occasionally piano. It serves its role better than in your typical show and some tunes will become familiar by the end of the show.\\n\r\nThe primary VAs are relatively fresh. Minami Shinoda does a great job giving Makoto a gentle yet eager personality; she makes pulling out weeds very entertaining. I can't really say the same for our male protagonist- Shinsuke Sugawara's character is just plain boring- his voice gives him a rather dull character that never seems to be phased by anything. The show is, however, supported by a lot of veterans cast in secondary roles. You have Ai Kayano and Ari Ozawa voicing witch familiars (they don't actually speak words) and Kikuko Inoue voicing the residence's mom, her performance outright puts a lot of the other characters to shame.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThere isn't that much to say for this category. The show basically has a bunch of interesting characters visiting the country residence and showcases a bunch of interactions between the cast. For instance, a good portion of one episode consists of multiple characters individually following the cat Chito while a large portion of another episode has our cast picking wild vegetables. There is actually a bit of educational material here in a similar vein to Silver Spoon but obviously to a lesser degree.\\n\r\nThe show is pretty episodic overall with just a few exceptions, and there isn't really any central plot or story progression. There's a bit of light comedy but otherwise it's just a lot of nice, peaceful scenes and interactions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe show focuses on Makoto, her elder sister, and her cousin. There isn't a lot of background on many of the characters; the show focuses more on just interactions. I wouldn't expect much in the form of romantic developments or even dynamic characters; other than Chinatsu, the other characters are pretty much the same all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some particularly interesting supporting characters, such as Inukai, but the majority of the interactions are simple conversations and occasional visits by unique spirits. Chinatsu and Akane (Makoto's sister who bears no family resemblance) are the main entertainers of the show; they have vibrant personalities, but aren't particularly deep.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nI didn't really have that many expectations coming into this show and it pretty much matched my expectations. It is a nice, peaceful show with a lot of calming scenery. If that's what you're into then by all means dig in. As for me, there wasn't much entertainment value out of it due to the various reasons listed above.",

            "content": "Flying Witch is the most slice-of-life slice of life anime to ever slice a life.\r\nIt\u2019s title is a hint as to what Flying Witch is about: a fifteen year old girl, Makoto, moves from Yokohama to the semi-rural town of Hirosaki, in Aomori Prefecture. She moves in with her aunt and uncle, as well as her cousins, Kei and Chinatsu. Makoto learns much about life in a semi-rural town, and has many pleasant adventures. But that\u2019s not all! You see, Makoto is a witch. Well, a witch in training. As a result, she\u2019s able to introduce her cousins to a number of supernatural occurrences. It\u2019slike the ultimate exchange student program.\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch \u2013 despite being about a witch and being a mix of comedy and slice of life \u2013 manages to have fairly grounded characters. I\u2019m not sure this plays to its strengths. Makoto is the protagonist, and she is... well... a protagonist? She\u2019s kind to everyone, she\u2019s easily lost, and she\u2019s a witch. That about sums her up. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Makoto is very likeable, and it\u2019s easier for the audience to identify with her, I suppose, but she doesn\u2019t breathe a lot of life into the series, either. Her cousin, Kei, is worse, in some respects, since he has a similarly safe personality and often takes on an expository role. Makoto\u2019s other, much younger cousin, Chinatsu and Makoto\u2019s older sister, Akane, who is also an experienced witch, both have a great deal more personality than Kei or Makoto. Whilst not every scene they\u2019re in is golden, they do tend to enliven Flying Witch in a very necessary way.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes in Flying Witch generally follow a certain formula. They will be neatly divided into two parts. Sometimes these two parts will readily follow one from the other, sometimes there might be a little overlap, and sometimes there won\u2019t be much connecting them. One half of the episode might deal with something mundane, the other with something magical. This isn\u2019t always the case, of course, but it seems to hold generally.\\n\\n\r\nI think it\u2019s important to ask what Flying Witch brings to the table that other slice of life anime don\u2019t. The idea of someone from the big city coming to a rural or semi-rural area and learning about life there isn\u2019t anything particularly new \u2013 off the top of my head, we have Barakamon and two seasons of Non Non Biyori. So, how does Flying Witch differentiate itself? Well, it is, ostensibly, about a witch \u2013 or a witch in a training \u2013 which implies that there\u2019ll be a greater emphasis on the supernatural than one might see in other, similar, anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where I take issue with Flying Witch. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a comfy, cozy, relaxing show. If you like slice of life anime \u2013 especially in the vein of Non Non Biyori \u2013 you\u2019ll probably like this one. But Flying Witch really fails to take proper advantage of the fact that it\u2019s about a witch. For example, in one episode, Kei takes Chinatsu and Makoto out herb-picking. After picking the herbs, Kei cooks them and the trio eat them. In itself, I found this a pleasant sequence, but it\u2019s something that could fit into any anime of the same genre and of similar setting. This seems like the perfect opportunity for Makoto to make some kind of useful potion, or show off some other witch-related skill that has to do with herbs or wild plants. She doesn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Makoto is a witch in training. But that is another aspect of Flying Witch that goes underutilized. Twice, we see Akane teach Makoto spells; both times these spells are treated as comedic setups. I did laugh, but I also wondered what Makoto was supposed to be learning and how she was to learn it. This is a slice of life anime, to be fair, so it\u2019s not going to have the kind of dedicated character arc that one might find in a more dramatic anime. Then again, we see character growth in Barakamon, for example, so it\u2019s not impossible. In one episode of Flying Witch, Makoto plants a garden; she claims learning about plants will help her to be a better witch. Does she learn anything from her garden? I don\u2019t know. I do know that she pickled some of the radishes that she grew. I wouldn\u2019t consider pickling radishes a talent only witches possess, however.\\n\\n\r\nThere are certainly supernatural elements in Flying Witch, and we do encounter other witches, but all of these things feel like they get more emphasis than perhaps they should. For example, in one episode, we meet the Harbinger of Spring, who goes around talking to witches and helping to awaken plants for spring and the like. He talks with Chinatsu and Makoto for a bit, then goes on his way. It\u2019s an amusing scene, but this comprises almost half an episode. I\u2019m not here to watch Flying Harbinger of Spring, but Flying Witch. It\u2019s perfectly fair to split time between the mundane aspects of life in a semi-rural town and magical occurrences, but I wish that those magical occurrences were more centered on Makoto (and only tangentially Akane or other witches) than on supernatural happenings that would be better as brief background events than the focus of half an episode.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that said, Flying Witch\u2019s animation, whilst not superlative, is superb. The backgrounds are a pleasure to watch, and there is a strong palette of earth tones that fit well with the show\u2019s themes and subject matter. Magical beings aside, the character designs are fairly realistic, if a touch generic. It helps Flying Witch feel grounded, even as supernatural events transpire. There really aren\u2019t a whole lot of weaknesses, visually speaking. Your eyes will never not be delighted.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, I find it hard to judge the quality of Japanese voice acting, as I\u2019m not fluent in the language. However, I did find Kei\u2019s voice actor to be a bit stiff. At times, he sounded more like the host of a cooking program than a character in an anime. Likewise, some of Kei\u2019s funnier lines fell a bit short due to the actor\u2019s presentation. Otherwise, the sound design was pretty good. The music was fairly upbeat and catchy, which enhanced the show\u2019s lighthearted nature.\\n\\n\r\nFlying Witch is a hard show not to like, but it is perhaps hurt by its premise. On the one hand, a slice of life anime about a young woman learning to be a witch is, if nothing else, interesting and somewhat unique. It presents a lot of opportunities for unique scenarios and set-ups that one doesn\u2019t often encounter in typical slice of life anime. Indeed, what interested me most about Flying Witch was its premise. However, Flying Witch fails to utilize its premise in any meaningful way. In some ways, it strikes me that Flying Witch indulges in a lot of the stereotypes associated with the slice of life genre: it\u2019s slow, nothing happens, there\u2019s no character growth. Those qualities aren\u2019t inherently negative, but there needs to be something more. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a disconnect, I think, between what Flying Witch ultimately is and what it promises itself to be. That isn\u2019t a reason not to watch it, but I do think one needs to temper one\u2019s expectations.",

            "content": "Flying Witch is a perfectly enjoyable wholesome anime to watch when you need a break from melodrama or crazy action or fanservice. The anime follows the experiences of Makoto, a witch who comes to live with her non-magical relatives. What follows is a series of pleasant slice-of-life moments as we get to know a little better a varied cast of characters.\r\nAn interesting choice by the writers is to have most of the main characters completely aware and supportive of the fact that Makoto is a witch, with only a couple of characters actually being surprised by her magical abilities, which do not take up thefocus of the show. The majority of the show are kind-of one-shot stories of the the main character doing something new, and the show rarely revisits old themes. This helps keep the show somewhat interesting with a rotating cast of supportive characters, but it also means there is very little over-arching narrative. A good number of the episodes could be viewed out of order and it wouldn't be very noticeable, including the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the story is that there seems to be little or no growth for the main character due to the lack of a meaningful goal for our main character. One of the episodes highlights this fact when a character asks Makoto if there is anything she is struggling with or worried about, and Makoto is unable to think of anything. The show steers clear of any romantic subplots as well for all characters, and some potential conflicts within the show are addressed once (in the episode they originate) and largely remain unresolved. These little things ultimately led me to begin getting bored with the show, but since the series was so short I instead am left feeling warm, happy vibes and just a little disappointment.\\n\\n\r\n I feel like another anime did a better job of presenting a young witch living in a non-magical but largely accepting world in \"kiki's delivery service\", but this show was still enjoyable to watch.",

Did I find it boring... yes... but I did manage to watch it entirely which is something many shows which had more events and at least a story going for them didn't manage to make me do. The art is beautiful and the animation great but it's just one of this weird Japanese anime where well... you wonder what is the point. I don't want to give it a bad rating, because it just feels like it's just NOT my kind of show. I was looking fora slice of life anime... and I got it... but I wish we had had more magic and at least a central theme going on. The witch is supposed to learn magic but there is no central direction. It's like all characters are living their happy life and that's it. I guess, it makes for a relaxing time after a stressful day at work but I wish it was a bit more like Akagami no Shirayukihime where although not much is happening and no character is truly evil or even remotely nasty, there was always a certain direction we were heading to, and story arcs available.  So here it is 6. It feels like I is unfair to the show but I can't give more than a 6 because truly I was bored senseless. True some rest after wtf plots and over the top characters is nice from time to time... but to me this show goes into too much nothing. On a side note, Akane's voice really got on my nerves after 3/4 episodes.",
