            "content": "-This review has been updated after all the episodes were aired, and was first written while the show was airing.  It is meant to help the reader determine if it is worthwhile watching an episode or two to form their own opinions.-\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo is a school comedy with little or no relevant story that focuses largely on verbal adult humor, generally avoiding visual adult humour. As with most shows of this genre, it isn\u2019t mind-blowing or beautiful \u2013 throughout the show I found myself noticing little aspects that the show could have done without. \r\nHowever, at the end of the each episode, I lookedback and realized that I had laughed throughout. I had realized that the show may not be spectacular, but it was funny. The randomness and quick pacing of the humor is vital to the show's appeal, and the show begins to settle into a quick, smooth pace after a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is important to note is that this humor will not be for everyone, and after two episodes the viewer should be able to decide whether or not they enjoy the type of humor enough to continue on with the show.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork & Sound: Average; nothing worth highlighting, nothing negative. It is worth mentioning that the Ending song is very catchy, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in Seitokai Yakuindomo are not terribly unique. Each character can be summed up as having some of the usual generic characteristics normally found in anime. However, the characters fit into their roles well, and it is because of this the humor succeeds.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The enjoyment of this show is what carries my generally favorable review of it (especially as the show progresses into its later episodes). At the end of the episode, you may not walk away amazed, but you will walk away with a few good laughs.",

            "content": "Is it possible to make a comedy revolving almost exclusively around sex jokes, and not have it come off low-brow and immature? \r\nThe answer? Seitokai Yakuindomo.\r\nThanks to clever wordplay, good writing and actual punch lines, Seitokai Yakuindomo manages to craft a sex comedy that avoids the pitfall of simply being crass for the sake of crassness and is all the more funnier for it. No matter how many jokes about ejaculation they make. By taking their sex jokes down the path of wordplay and and humorous misunderstandings, (instead of making shallow references to dicks and expecting the audience fall over dead from laughter), Seitokai Yakuindomoalmost manages to give itself a sense of class. Almost. But more importantly, this makes the gags actually funny. \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, those who hate sex jokes, or the easily offended, probably won't enjoy Seitokai Yakuindomo. And yet somehow, the show manages to not be ridiculously offensive, despite containing gags that would make South Park blush. I think this is combination of the way the jokes are presented in an innocent, serious way (sort of like the characters are unaware what they're saying is inappropriate for the situation, if that makes sense) and the colourful cheery art style.\\n\\n\r\nThis series makes no bones about what is is, that is, it's nothing more than a platform for a rapid-fire series of sex jokes, and at this, I feel it's a flying success. The show is absolutely hilarious, which is all it needs to be. As a result, there's very little I can criticize it for. It's only real flaw is the length, only thirteen episodes, which is average for most anime, but for Seitokai Yakuindomo, it feels like this isn't enough and it has more jokes to tell. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a decent plot or a nice story, go somewhere else. Seitokai Yakuindomo doesn't have either of it. Seitokai Yakuindomo is about an all-girls school turned co. The girls don\u2019t really mind this though; it\u2019s more like a dream come true for most of them. Through the whole series it\u2019s one perverted joke after the other. Most of them you can see coming from a mile away, but they will make you laugh anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation often switches between normal animation and chibi mode. Usually I don\u2019t like it when there\u2019s too much chibi in an anime, but with Seitokai Yakuindomo I didn't really mind. Perhaps it\u2019s because I put my mind on blank while watching this.\\n\\n\r\nMusic fits the series perfectly, especially the dynamic, rhythmic and crazy, and a phenomenal opening and twisted ending. Because of the dialogue and humour it's difficult to pay attention to music in the background, but there are some good pieces. Very well emphasizes moral and peaceful moments in the series.\\n\\n\r\nI generally like the different characters in Seitokai Yakuindomo. I guess they\u2019re actually not that different (they\u2019re all perverted girls), but two of our main characters are normal people, trying to put some common sense in most of the school. The interaction between these is the main power of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Seitokai Yakuindomo is an excellent comedy series, provided you don't find it's lewd subjects offensive, and you don't mind that there's very little story. Anyone who loves a well-written sex comedy should check it out.\\n\\n\r\nI probably only enjoyed this because of my young age and immaturity, that's right all you pedophiles. COME AT ME BRO.\\n\r\nI mean I'm a masochist. \\n\r\nWait what.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that Seitokai Yakuindomo is probably right up there on the top 5 anime to have me in hysterics every 5 minutes or so, if you're looking for an anime full of laughs, simple characters and no emotional story so there's no drama, this is EXACTLY what you're looking for, if you're looking for romance, ecchi, love triangles, drama, sadness etc, you should probably give this a miss, although there are vague hints of love interest.\r\nThe story revolves around Takotoshi Tsuda, A male high school student who decides to transfer to an all-girls school simply because its closer to home,he ends up being forcibly recruited into the student body council as a male representative. He is joined by three girls;\\n\\n\r\nShino Amakusa - a second-year student and student body president, she is very serious and wants things done perfectly, she excels in academics, but all that is shadowed by the fact that she is a complete pervert, and the main reason she took an interest to Takotoshi was to 'examine' him in Health and Social class (Yep, you know exactly where i'm going with this), she is very self conscious about her breast size, and the fact her secretary, Aria, is well endowed, is the recipe for a perfect jealousy driven relationship between the two.\\n\\n\r\nAria Shichijo - Also a second year, she plays the role of the student body secretary, she comes from a very rich family and just by appearance you'd expect her to be the most mature character...and if you make that assumption, you're horribly wrong.\\n\r\nAria is extremely perverted too, more than Shino is, she manages to twist and turn even the most innocent and simplest of sentences into a fanfiction-esque scene which appear in thought bubbles, because she is absurdly rich and well pampered, she often finds herself in completely ridiculous situations, such as standing blankly in front of a door expecting it to slide open, or standing on the bottom step of a staircase thinking its an elevator. She too is incredibly smart, and is ranked second, underneath Shino, of course, in her class midterms.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we have Suzu Hagimura, who is in the same year as our unfortunate protagonist, again, she is very smart and often brags about her ability to do 10 digit arithmetic calculations in her head to cover up the fact she's not really good at any physical activities, although she is 16 years old and considers her self to be superior to Takotoshi, she is often the butt of the joke when it comes to childlike appearance and height as she is less than half the size of the other three and in one episode, needs a chair to reach the top shelf of her own cabinet, this often causes her to go into a super-saiyan rage whenever her unnaturally small stature is brought into a conversation, and of course, Takotoshi is the straight man for them all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i like about this show is that all the characters have their own traits , pros and cons which make them completely different from one another, although these characters aren't well flushed out with heaps of back story and social problems (they don't need to be for this genre of anime) the characters end up being likeable anyway, whether its for the witty banter between them in literally EVERY scene, or whether its the shear pervertedness of Shino and Aria (especially Aria, damn man) its definitely a must watch.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime to anyone, especially to fans of K-On! or Lucky Star (although the themes in this are significantly more mature than anything in K-On! and Lucky Star)\\n\\n\r\nThankyou for reading, message me an anime you want me to review and have a good day!\\n\\n\r\n-Matty",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuin domo: The Show Prison School and Shimoneta Wanted To Be! \r\nPreface:\r\nThe Japanese school setting + student council + all girl's school with few male entrants + perverted characters + ecchi/fanservice/nudity/andor harem is a really tired, really overdone concept at this point. For example: there have been at least 20 such shows involving at least 2 of the aforementioned tropes just THIS year. Count 'em. \r\nThe reason that there are currently so many of these shows is less that they're a real \"work\" and more of a \"product\" designed and marketed specifically to an audience that consistently and routinely purchases their product in largequantities. It's like the cigarette of anime. They're not good for you, but a lot of people really love them, and keep on buying it even though they know it's killing them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever- even the most cynical reviewers among us eventually realize that even the most recycled concepts and tropes can still make for an effective and enjoyable show... IF executed properly. Though Seitokai Yakuin domo includes all of the above with the exception of the last trope I mentioned, the writers took the established tropes and turned them upside down, adding some freshness to a nauseatingly stale formula. It's all about turning that \"girls can't be pervs\" trope upside down, and in that regard- a great success!\\n\\n\r\nEven though it's a comedy- I only laughed out loud one time at Seitokai Yakuin domo. It's kind of like The Big Lebowski (or any Coen Brothers' film for that matter) in that it's not actually funny at all. \\n\\n\r\nIt's entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a chuckle comedy- not an uproarious, couch clutching, gasping for breath humor riot. They do tend to wear out the jokes after a while, and if you never found them funny in the first place (like in Prison School), then you're in for a long watch. \\n\\n\r\nIf incessant panty shots and boobs are your main attraction to these shows, SYD is NOT for you. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation/Sound/Voice Acting: 7\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, I really only watched this show because it was animated by GoHands, and it looks like most anime made in this decade: shiny, colorful, and pretty fluid. One thing I noticed (and liked about this anime) was that nobody had ridiculous hairstyles NOR did they have unnatural hair colors. Everyone actually looked like a normal human being, which, for a school anime, is a HUGE step. +1 for progressiveness. \\n\\n\r\nThe voices are handled competently, veteran Yoko Hikasa (Rias Gremory) was great as Shino, and Satomi Arai plays the deadpan creeper Hata (She also portrayed Saotome from the more recent Shimoneta, a very similar character hmmmmmmmmm)\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nSYD was adapted from a long running 4 panel comic that's essentially just a collection of making fun of trope scenes from other anime, along with their own flavor of sex jokes. That said, it's difficult to take 30 or 40 four panel one liner jokes and turn that into a single episode. GoHands somehow manages to make it flow into an easy to follow comedy show about life in the student council with this pretty radical choppy pace coupled with segments that take the original jokes and expound upon them. They added a lot more context and setup, and then let it play out. \\n\\n\r\nYou're actually shown the punchline as a commercial slide, and then the scene plays out, giving you something to chew on and wonder where this weird, out of context line comes from. It definitely helps with the impact as well- kind of an \"OHHHH\" moment for the longer jokes.\\n\\n\r\nThe general premise of SYD is that Tsuda, our MC, is a newly accepted student to the formerly all girls Ousai Academy. On his first day, he makes the mistake of not tightening his tie, which attracts the ire of the Student Council President, Shino- who teaches him a lesson by fixing his tie, strangling him, and then forcibly inducts him into the Student Council. The rest of the show takes place over the school year, with the various holidays, sex jokes, outings, gross out jokes, and mischief that come along with it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nThere are four student council members, President Shino, VP Tsuda, Secretary Aria, and Treasurer Suzu. There're also four other characters of note: the creepy lady teacher Yokoshima, who is basically a pedophile and tries incessantly to get with the few guys attending the school, Hata, the monotone speaking newspaper club member who always shows up to take scandalous and incriminating photos of everyone, Mitsuba, the adorably innocent (of the horrible sexual things Aria and Shino say) Judo girl, and Kaede, who is man-phobic. \\n\\n\r\nEach character has an in show 4th wall breaking description: Shino, \"the perfect human\" (who is an incorrigible pervert), Aria, \"the multitalented princess with big boobs\" (rich girl airhead everyone fawns over, also a pervert), and Suzu \"IQ of 180\" (height of 4'5\", terrible napoleon complex and hates being treated like a child). Tsuda, our MC, is basically the world's most legendary straight man. He serves for there to be a brick wall to hit for the endless stream of sex and poop jokes coming from Shino/Aria. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe actual content of the jokes is what I referred to as refreshing in the beginning. I have not seen an anime with such disgusting, foul content toilet jokes since Panty and Stocking. It goes so overboard with perversion of speech and dirty jokes + toilet humor that it's not even scandalous anymore, it's commonplace. You know, without a doubt, that everything that comes out of Shino's or Aria's mouths is going to be a) a bad sex joke, b) a women's hygiene gross out joke, or c) some \"accidental\" misreading/pronunciation of a normal kanji that then turns the meaning into something sexual. \\n\\n\r\nWhile these are fairly common in comedy anime, again, the degree to which they describe some of this stuff is pretty nasty, so +1 for edgy. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nWell, this ran a lot longer than I wanted it to- but it's important to see more formative shows in genre tropes- and one can see the obvious influences this show (and the comics before it) had on such newer titles as Prison School and Shimoneta. \\n\\n\r\nAria: \"Wow, a whole year has passed. It only felt like a few months.\"\\n\r\nShino: \"In an anime, that'd be about 13 episodes!\"\\n\r\nTsuda: \"That's a little too dangerous...\"",

            "content": "I have seen over 300 different Anime over the years, including notably terrible Anime, like Shingetsutan Tsukihime, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, Umineko no Naku Koro ni, Mars of Destruction, Xenosaga: The Animation, Mahou Sensei Negima and InuYasha, and I can safely say that Seitokai Yakuindomo is the absolute worst Anime I have ever seen. \r\nI rarely drop Anime, even the worst ones. I usually complete an Anime no matter how bad it is, just so I can tell people \"Don't watch this Anime, it's terrible\" with a completely unbiased opinion. However, Seitokai Yakuindomo is SO BAD that I couldn't hold out for any longerthan episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo is the worst kind of Anime, pandering to the worst kind of Anime \"fan\" (I use quotations because you are no kind of Anime fan if you enjoy crap like this), a shallow \"comedy\" (I use quotations because it's not funny) that focuses on fanservice and repetitive sex-related \"jokes\" that only the most immature, sexually depraved teenagers could possibly enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no comedy to be found here. Every single \"joke\" is pulled from the same gutter, oftentimes using the exact same \"joke\" multiple times in an episode. Then again, you can barely call them jokes. Here, let me rewrite this paragraph again below, in the style of Seitokai Yakuindomo's \"jokes\", to give you an idea of what to expect.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no S&M to be found here. Every single penis is pulled from the same condom, oftentimes using the exact same penis multiple times in a vagina. Then again, you can barely call them dicks. Here, let me molest this virgin again below, in the style of Seitokai Yakuindomo's period, to give you an idea of what to fuck.\\n\\n\r\nThat wasn't funny, was it? Why, that was offensive, wasn't it? It sounded like shameless pandering to perverted, immature teenagers, didn't it? Well, guess what? That is exactly what Seitokai Yakuindomo's dialog is like. This is Seitokai Yakuindomo's idea of a \"joke\", which it will use in every single scene despite the fact that it wasn't funny the first time, much less the dozens of other times. \\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutely no reason to watch Seitokai Yakuindomo, it's just plain bad. There's no way to argue it, you cannot possibly gain any sort of enjoyment from watching it. And, well, if you THINK you enjoy Seitokai Yakuindomo, well, you're probably 12 years old and think it's funny to draw dicks in your math book. \\n\\n\r\nAt least the opening and ending themes are pretty good.",

            "content": "Before you go all harem on this show, just think back to your blooming adolescent and teenage years. For boys and girls alike, wasn't your mind constantly filled with inappropriate thoughts? There wasn't much of a trigger to set you off; testosterone and estrogen are powerful little demons. So instead of marketing those stupidly impossible innocent anime girls other series seem so fond of, why not appeal potty humor to a wider audience that each individual has, at one point, experienced? I may not know much about how the opposite gender thinks, but for us guys, certain thoughts flit about our heads like angry bees,never leaving us alone. This may all seem off-topic, Seitokai Yakuindomo delivers the highest of quality of sexual jokes, all while incorporating a storyline and masterfully pulling off a non-harem, hilarious and wonderfully executed anime. \\n\\n\r\n Story: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple: an all girl high school recently became co-ed. STOP. Before you go further, isn't your first automatic judgement to insult another hentai-style slice of life anime? Of course! Any sane person would. A friendly, non-perverted guy by the name of Tsuda enters the school, unwittingly tripping off Shina Amakasu and the rest of the all-girl student. After some misunderstandings, randomness and hilarity, he is forced into the student council - with gratifying results. \\n\\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong, haters may understand that these sort of anime don't have a storyline. Most of the time, they're right. Here, it does apply somewhat; a frilly way to tell a story, so to speak. However, I had a wonderful time watching the student council do their every day activities - with a twist. These aren't your normal, typical, average, innocent virgin high school girls; these are some of the craziest anime girls I've ever come across. There seems to be no end to the jokes and innuendoes; and interestingly enough, TSUDA (THE GUY, FOR FREAKING SAKE) is the innocent one. What in all that is mighty in the anime world has this come to? A guy? As the sole non-perverted rock amid this flood of girls? This anime was so different, I was instantly hooked - and so should you be.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was gorgeous and bright. I typically don't like overdone scenes or underdone scenes, and this didn't disappoint me in the lease. There were times when they decided to go for the chibi look randomly and drew the characters innocently - an interesting juxtaposition, because while in chibi mode the characters decided to say funny little innuendos.... Ah well. Enough gushing. What I didn't like? Sometimes the artwork borderlined porn. No way out of that... I mean, it looked fine and all, but trying watching those scenes while there are young people around you! Geez, put some CLOTHES ON. But seriously, even then the artwork never dipped below par.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED. Wow. What an upbeat, fantastical way of starting an anime. The OP was perfect and catchy, on my ipod in seconds, and the ED was.....weird. Sorta serious, sorta not. The background music melded perfectly with the on-screen mood, but in and of itself I was not impressed as much. Though I know I repeat this in my other reviews, but seriously, pay attention to the voice acting. Try acting out those scenes by yourself. It's not easy; but when you can make perverted jokes into a mic without eliciting even a laugh, that takes some guts. The voices were spot on, serious and joking, warm and memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLovely, lovely cast. Perfect for the story, each character represented a typical sort of archetype. Tsuda, the innocent one; Hagimiru, the tsundere, the list goes on and on. Each character had their moments and contributed a little more to the story; even Tsuda's little ball of comedy managed to get a good laugh out of me. But seriously, I loved each and every character, because they simply melded so perfectly. It's so hard to imagine a different cast or to introduce another main character, because the magic happened with this perfect combination. It wasn't perfect; there were some stupid parts (even the best cake may be too sweet for some people), but overall, it was beautiful to see the interactions take place. Though there wasn't much of a character arc at all for anyone, I enjoyed their daily banter nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy is the average score so low? Many people looked past what this anime was really trying to go for (toilet humor) and just hit it with a low score and moved on. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy; if you watch the first episode and grudgingly try and finish it, you're experience won't be nearly as pleasant than if you were to go into watching each episode with enthusiasm and a piece of pie. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short but sweet little 13 episode anime. Don't look at the superficial, shallow characteristics; dig a little deeper, and what you'll find may actually not be a condom but a vibrating Christmas present...",

            "content": "\"Dick-jokes the anime\", these were the words that got me interested in this show, and it I couldn't describe it any better. It starts off seeming like a typical romcam/harem, but Seitokai Yakuindomo has its own unique genre of humor that sets it apart from the norm. \r\nAs a show with constant references to dildos, cum, sex, incest, boobs, panties, dicks and literally everything dirty you can honestly think of, in a show about high school girls, you would think this would be ecchi, but it's not. It's a slice of life anime with some of the most creative and unique comedy I have everseen. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around the typical harem lead male surrounded by beautiful girls (The school is 95% women), but the great thing about it is that each girl represents a porn category/fetish. Notable one's include incest, extreme fetishes, innocent/amateur, voyeur, midget, and milf, but the list goes on. They all have amazing personalities that compliment their \"role\" in the show's twisted sense of humor. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing is excellent, I find myself occasionally bored but more often than not I was laughing my ass off. The jokes are generally creative, and some scenes are almost impossible not to laugh. If you find immature humor funny, such as the type of stuff you might see in Gintama, this is a show made for you.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side, arguably this shows weakest point is its lack of story. It heavily reminds me of something like Kiss x Sis in that regard, it has some minor plot regarding entrance exams but for the most part every episode feels like an OVA, and the episodes themselves are so fragmented that it can sometimes be hard to follow. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, as mentioned already there times where the humor does get a little stale, since it is basically sex jokes as far as the eye can see. Sometimes the humor feels forced and the jokes are word for word repeats of previous episodes. These are few and far between but keep this in mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, by now you should know whether or not you'll like it. Perverted humor is not for everyone, but if you enjoy it, this show has made a science out of it.",

            "content": "What comes to mind when you think about high school girls? No, I\u2019m not talking about perverted stuff, but rather how they act. Most of us think that high school girls are shy, oversensitive and keep to themselves and that\u2019s pretty much how they\u2019re depicted in a lot of media these days, especially in anime. Seitokai Yakuindomo shows us a different side of modern teenagers and brings lots of humour and parody with it.\r\nBasically, Seitokai Yakuindomo is about a teenager named Tsuda Takatoshi who decides to attend Ousai Academy due to the fact that it\u2019s close to his home, even though this particular high schoolused to be a former all-girls\u2019 academy up until recently. During his very first day at school, Tsuda meets a couple of girls who turn out to be members of the student council. Some of them are actually quite perverted and often spurt out the dirtiest jokes, but what\u2019s worse is that they recruit Tsuda into the student council and even go as far as to make him vice-president. This all happens in a matter of minutes and our unfortunate hero has little say in any of it.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the thirteen episodes of Seitokai Yakuindomo you\u2019ll be constantly bombarded with dirty sex jokes, perverted talk and unwanted information about the female body and their period cycle. There are little to no serious scenes in the entire anime and most of it comprises of convenient situations to score another sex joke or a dirty conversation, with Tsuda often used as a serious retort or an enraged response.\\n\\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t too many characters in the anime, though most of them are put to good use and no of them feel forced or useless. You\u2019ve got the protagonist, Tsuda Takatoshi who just wants to lead a normal life and high school but is constantly attacked by his fellow female students with dirty jokes and unwarranted accusations. Then there are the three other members of the student council, all female, obviously. Shino Amakusa is the president of the council and maybe the most perverted of all characters, always available when you need a quick dirty joke. Aria Shichijou is the mature rich girl, though her mind is just about as perverted as that of Shino\u2019s. Last but not least, yet definitely the shortest, is Suzu Hagimura, the intelligent and silent girl. She is about the same age as Tsuda, but has the body of an elementary school student. You won\u2019t get any dirty comments from her, but her short height will often be used as comic relief and target of several jokes.\\n\\n\r\nSeitokai certainly works well as a comedy and its non-stop approach at humour and constant verbal gags keeps every episode fun and entertaining. What the anime lacks in proficiency it makes up for with its engaging plot and easy-going nature. It\u2019s definitely not a great series and apart from an episode that takes place on the beach or another one where our heroes celebrate Christmas, Seitokai Yakuindomo lacks diversity. Most of the anime takes place at the academy, namely inside a couple of rooms and on a corridor. Whenever our characters are taken in a different location, it\u2019s often only so as to set up a joke or make a funny remark at something in that particular environment. Another weak point is that every episode seems to be cut down in short scenes, each about one minute, that feature some random dialogue between a couple of our characters followed by one or two dirty jokes. Every scene starts with a build-up to the future joke or gag and usually ends directly after its purpose has been complete and the laughs and giggles have taken place.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s rather hard to predict if you\u2019ll like Seitokai Yakuindomo or not. Some will be drawn to it by its simple premise and fast pacing while others are going to be turned off by the overwhelming amount of sex jokes and weird character interactions. I really didn\u2019t know what to make this series during the first few episodes and I simply couldn\u2019t connect with certain scenes, which in the ended left an awkward impression on me. I got used to it eventually and after a while each episode turned out to be even funnier than the last one. It\u2019s not an anime that I\u2019ll remember for too long, though. It all comes down to what you\u2019re looking for: there are enough laughs to be had in Seitokai Yakuindomo and it\u2019s rarely boring or changing pace, so you can hardly go wrong with it. If you\u2019re looking for a little more substance, on the other hand, then I advise you to keep on searching.",

The jokes are played well, the characters contribute well to the flow, and it seems to carry a universal appeal.

            "content": "It's my second review, so don't be very harsh with me. \r\nI think you'll like it!\r\nART: 10\r\nThe art in this Anime is, of course, great. And in the biggest part that's because this is an Anime of 2010. You'll enjoy watching the art which is present in this Anime, because it's a very good one. All emotions and feelings are expressed very well on the characters' faces.\r\nSTORY: 9\r\nThis Anime has a very original story and characters. There are no other Anime titles which have such plot. A guy, who recently changed his place of living, tranfers to a school which just changed from a girls'one to a co-ed and now it's still full of girls. Don't think bad about him! He's not a pervert. The reason he did this, is because that school is near the house he lives in. In the moment he entered the school, he is noticed by the Student's Council President and is enrolled immediatly in Council. The reason of this action was the thing that \"school needed a male's point of view\" and she wanted opinions from a male's perspective. And after this, he gets through a lot of events with girls. Oh, I forgot to mention, Student's Council consists of 3 girls. The two of them are so perverted! I couldn't believe my eyes! I have never seen such perverted girls in my life! You'll laugh a lot! It's so funny!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the main characters are 3 girls from Student's Council and Tsuda that transfered there. Aria and Shino from Council are the most perverted girls you had ever saw. Suzu is a very wise one, but is considered to be a child because of her height and some of her habits. The main protagonist, Tsuda Takatoshi, is a normal boy like all of us, but not as perverted as some of us. I liked a lot how the President, Shino, behaves. She's so funny with all her erotic thoughts. If you like to watch comedy and funny Anime titles, then it's for you.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\\n\r\nI can't tell very much about this part of Anime, because you'll not have time to notice such things, 'cause you'll laugh a lot at some scenes.\\n\r\nThe OP & ED are good and they were chose very good to this Anime. Sound great characterizes  events that happen and emotions/ feelings that characters experience at that moments. Sound environment doesn't bother you, but suits very good this Anime!!!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERAGE: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very funny Anime you must watch if you would like to see what happens in a girls' only school with a perverted Student's Council President. You will laugh at her rules and actions. Also, in Anime are used uncensored words (like masturbation, anal/oral sex, vagina, etc.) that are censored due to the fact that it's a PG-13 rated Anime. I recommend you to watch Ayako release (the same I watched), because of some reasons: \\n\r\n1) Words that are audio-censored in Anime, are translated in subs, so you'll read the real things that are said. I mean, subs translate to you those things and you'll laugh more than if you'll watch a Raw (I mean, those who can).\\n\r\n2) This is a very good subgroup and you'll agree more with this after you'll watch this Anime.\\n\r\nThis subgroup translated all words with double-meaning (that are often used), where one meaning is perverted/erotic for sure. The fact is that the President, Shino, very often thinks about that one. Also, were translated all Japanese words that are related to Japanese culture/history and are known/used only in Japan. (For example, Nyotaimori is the practice using women's bodies as a serving dish, usually for sushi.) (would you like to try something like that with your loved one?  addressed to male part who reads this review).\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, watch this Anime ([Ayako] 720p release) for a good mood and AMAZING Impressions!!!!!",

            "content": "I told myself I'd write a review for Seitokai Yakuindomo immediately after finishing it, but eh, a couple weeks later is okay, right?\r\nStory: 6\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo's story is very clich\u00e9. A boy starts attending a school that used to be girls-only, he joins the student council, which has only female members--we've all heard it before etc, etc. If you're looking for epic plot and character development, look elsewhere, Seitokai Yakuindomo is good for laughs, not becoming a better human being, going on an adventure through anime, or other things like that; It's not even good for fapping. The reason I personally enjoyed Seitokai Yakuindomo was preciselythat. Seitokai Yakuindomo is perverted by all means, but it's in a different way than the majority of ecchi shows...It's actually funny. Throughout this 13-episode Seitokai no Ichizon lookalike, you'll actually laugh. The comedy ranges from simple comedic timing, to completely perverted jokes, to out-of-place 'wtf why is there a teddy bear with a ballgag?'. This show is a very fun watch, but I will tell you to steer clear of it if either of the following apply to you: 1) You're looking for something serious 2) You dislike anything remotely related to ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSYD's art is nothing amazing, but it's definitely nothing bad either. The animation is nice and flows smoothly and the characters are cute. Of course there is some censoring of certain.. objects.. but that doesn't take away from the show because you'll definitely know what they are. And it's not like there is any explicit ecchi content (as in naked people) to censor.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nIn terms of Seiyuu, SYD has decently popular voice actors. Shino and Aria are voiced by Hikasa Youko and Satou Satoumi (the voices of Mio and Ritsu of K-On!), respectively. And, my personal favorite, Arai Satomi (Kuroko from To Aru Majutsu no Index/To Aru Kagaku no Railgun) lends her voice to the expressionless newspaper club member, Hata Ranko. There are no complaints to be made about the voice acting in SYD, and hey, I like the opening as well. Osai Girls and Boys~!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters really make the show for me here. Well maybe not the characters, but the things that they say. Shino: tall blunt school prez, Aria: tall, busty Shirley-lookalike Ojou-sama, Suzu: genius loli Nagi-lookalike with a Napoleon complex, Tsuda: generic too nice anime lead. I just gave you a good idea of the characters you will encounter when watching Seitokai Yakuindomo, I'm sure they sound pretty much as generic as possible, but if you watch the show, I think you'll find that with good, entertaining writing, even the most generic characters can become hilarious. \\n\r\nAlso, an honourable mention to Yokoshima-sensei, she's awesome.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis is what made me continue to watch Seitokai Yakuindomo throughout summer 2010 season. The writing on this show is hilarious. I liked this show because I never knew what the characters were going to say next, but I knew whatever it was, it'd be funny. I laughed through every episode and you will too, as long as you don't fall into one of the 'do not watch' categories I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show to anyone who wants something that will make them laugh, doesn't mind pervertedness, and has free time on their hands. This show isn't a total /must see/, but if you enjoyed what I said about it in my review, I recommend checking it out :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "There seems to have been a lot of recent anime adapted from 4-koma mangas recently, Seitokai Yakuindomo (SYD for short) is one them.\r\n====================*WARNING*======================\r\n If you are the type of person who are not into constant sex related jokes and innuendos, then you can stop reading now, this anime is definitely is not for you.\r\n====================*WARNING*======================\r\nWith that said, let's move on.\r\nStory:\r\nThe main character, Takatoshi Tsuda, is forced into joining the student council of Ousai High School, which was formerly an all-girls school, by the president Akamusa Shino, in order to have a male's perspective into issues surrounding the new now co-ed school.\r\nThis being a 4-koma comedy, thereis pretty much nothing that you can call an overall plot whatsoever as the anime is based on the 4 student council members and the time they spend there.\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, at least 90% of the comedy in the series are all adult, sex-related jokes. It will be hard going into an episode and not hear the characters use words like cum, penis, vagina, dildo, masturbation, etc...you get the idea. The series tries to deliver the jokes in new and clever ways each time, but even then some people might find the show start to get repetitive and old pretty fast. That was not the case for me luckily.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhile the art is not outstanding, the series shines with a bright and vibrant colour scheme. The chibi-deformed versions of the characters look adorable, and overall the animation is easy on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the VAs do a respectable job in their roles, and with many well known voices in this series it all comes together nicely. In terms of BGM, its what you would expect from your standard comedy, high school anime, nothing really worth mentioning. The OP and ED themes however are surprisingly catchy and im still looping them even as I write this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs far as character goes, I think it was one of the more enjoyable aspects of SYD. While none of the characters are really unique and they all follow common stereotypes (Tsuda being the tsukomi, Aria is the rich girl who is ignorant about common things, Hagimura is the loli with a complex over it, and Shino is just Shino), they manage to blend together nicely and produce plenty of humorous events throughout the series, mainly because 90% of the cast are pretty much perverts. The side characters as well give the series an extra boost in comedy and many of them are likable. While romance is not the main focus of the series, by the later half of the series we are shown a bit of possible future relationship between Tsuda and some of the girls, in a show were everything is adult related comedy, its a rather nice addition and it doesnt derail the series' direction. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI will be the first to admit that I wasnt into the show for the first 3 or so episodes, I usually dont enjoy the animes that are mostly about perverted talk/actions (latest example: B Gata H Kei) but this show slowly won me over and ended up becoming the show I was anticipating the most this season for reasons I still havent figured out myself fully (maybe the characters). I can say for sure that this series does get better as it goes along, and it does not lose momentum from there (except maybe the last episode). \\n\\n\r\nOverall if you are looking for a series with a potty mouth, then you must not look any further than this. If you can giggle at jokes involving dildos, penis, erection, vagina, masturbation, etc...you will also find the comedy in this series to be pretty damn funny. And if you are not into this kind of stuff, maybe the small romance scenes in the latter half might keep you interested. Either way from the very beginning this series sets its target audience, and if you belong in this audience i doubt you will be disappointed. For those who just cannot enjoy a more \"dirty\" type of humour, then you are looking for the wrong anime. With hopes of a possible second season, I can say with confidence \"I love Ousai, I love SYD\".",

Okay, so here goes...\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo tells us about a normal-looking guy who's going to spend his 3 years of high school in a former all-girls school which has just gone co-ed. Suddenly he got recruited by the student council on the first day of school. Things went smooth for him, and then at some point, romantic flags comes appearing out of nowhere just like a cliched rom-com anime. \r\nIf you think that's what going to happen in this anime, then you're ahundred percent wrong. \\n\\n\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo is actually about a group of student council of an all-girls school that has just turned into a co-ed school. This group consist of 4 people, 3 girls and a guy.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a diligent, smart, athletic president whose sex orientation is a bit screwed up, Amakusa Shino\\n\\n\r\nA beautiful, rich secretary whose having puberty problems just like the president, Shichijou Aria\\n\\n\r\nA tiny-looking girl who happens to be the treasurer, Hagimura Suzu\\n\\n\r\nAnd the normal, straight-man, main character, and also the vice president, Tsuda Takatoshi.\\n\\n\r\nEveryday in the student council room is day full of Tsuda's punchline reacting to the immaturity of Shino and Aria regarding sex. Anddd, sometimes it's just Suzu's insult to others when she's being teased tiny.\\n\\n\r\nOh, before I forgot, this is a gag anime which consist of serial short skits. This anime contains lots of jokes related to sex. I suggest you to be an adult to watch this, or at least have a sufficient knowledge of sex. Personally, I watched this when I was younger and found some \"things\" hard to understand, such as dildos, chasity belt, masturbation and other stuff which is a completely unsuitable for Justin Bieber.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really know if this could be considered funny or not. I mean, I laughed a bit, but so often it just keeps giving sex jokes which I couldn't really understand. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a rom-com anime, then you're definitely looking at the wrong place.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a comedy anime, I can't say that this anime is guaranteed to be funny, since some jokes are not for everybody.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I could say that if you're a person with a reasonable knowledge of sex, and also a reasonable sense of humor, Seitokai Yakuindomo is 'maybe' the right choice to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "SYD...if you're looking for a good laugh, this is definitely one of the best out there. Full of shocking and vulgar sex jokes, there is no filter on the mouths of these hilarious characters as they try to live the life of high school students while controlling their unmatched sex drives. \r\nStory (7/10): \r\nThe story itself is pretty simple. Tsuda Takatoshi is a new student at Ousai Academy and he is accidentally forced to join the student council (all girls) by day one. What he doesn't know is just how perverted the president and vice president are of this council. Whether it's discussing how toexperiment S&M on teddy bears or pester Takotshi about how many times he \"finishes\" per day, there is no rest for Takotshi as he tries to keep up with the seemingly unlimited energy of the council. \\n\r\nThe weakness of this kind of comedy, however, is that there really is no central plot. Each episode is self-contained and does nothing more than set up the situation for the jokes, so anyone looking for a profound story, a slice-of-life, or even a school romance will be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nGood animation. Nothing worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): \\n\r\nThought the opening and ending themes were pretty good. Nothing super spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10):\\n\r\nThere's no doubt these characters were hilarious. Coupled with Takatoshi and Hagimura's stunned reactions, these characters will keep you entertained from start to finish. Do not worry that the jokes are only sexual; they honestly don't get old. But this is all assuming we look at these characters from a comedic perspective. Once again, there aren't any deep background stories or in-depth looks at their personal struggles; this is no slice-of-life. It is pure comedy.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nI thought this show was hysterical. I never found the jokes repetitive since they were so shocking; unfiltered vulgarity  has its own charm. Even if you're not a fan of sexual jokes, I suggest you give this type of humor a try. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\r\nApproach this show as if you would approach a stand-up comedy: don't expect any deep stories, expect comedy and you will receive.  \\n",

This all base on my opinion, so even if I like or hate it, you still might love this series.  :)  I just love writing reviews.  I gave it a 8 on Story mostly because there is only 2 episodes out and I do not know what the plot will be.  So far, this show is pure comical action through perverted jokes made my the Shino (Mio from K-on!) and Aria (Ritsu from K-on!).  Now however, if some of you guys are watching it for Yoko and Satomi, sadlyAria has more of a higher voice than Ritsu and Shino, is well more perverted than Mio will ever be. lol Their characters are nothing similar.\\n\\n\r\nI like all the character personality, since it's comedy, I expect them to make me laugh, or at least make me smile lol.  Anyways, so far the jokes aren't bad, but I hope they don't rely solely on perverted jokes alone.  I didn't really like it the first time I watched it because after watching K-on... it threw me off that Mio's voice was a perverted personality lol.  So watch the first episode, and try to erase Mio's character.  You might enjoy the perverted comedy, or maybe you may pass :)",

After that you see what happens in the student council, the adventures they go on and the time they spend together\r\nAlthough this anime has no plot (because of it's genre), it was really enjoyable (if you are into sex related jokes).  About 90-95% of the jokes in this anime were sex-related andthey had me laughing a lot even though I find them somewhat repetitive.  The concept of this anime seems really simple but it works.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't anything too special, we got Shino the student body president, who is perfect (except for that one flaw), Aria the rich girl, Suzu the loli and a whole bunch of minor characters.  Sure the characters might not be unique but they all fit into their roles and that's all I ask for.  In this kind of anime there really wouldn't be any character development but there are one or two love interests flying around, but the anime isn't really too heavy on it, I guess it's because of the genre. However it would be nice if they did have some romance but I guess that's asking for too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is clear and they do have some moments where the characters are in chibi version but nothing too special and nothing negative either\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound there is nothing too special here either, the voice actors are alright and I would say fit the role, the OP and ED songs are at par.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this series quite a bit, I got to say this is one of the funniest anime series I've watched this year.  If you're not into sex-related jokes then I would bypass this anime but if you just want a laugh like me I recommend SYD. Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "If something came to me after watching Setokai Yakuindomo (SYD) it was that I never figured out if the male lead is gay or not. That, and the fact society sure is changing fast these days. Maybe GoHands was better off restoring their mistake and making Princess Lover into a H series again.\r\nSummarizing this series, let's take B Gata H Kei as example. Remove the shyness about adult subjects and instead make it the most common subject to talk about in the world. Replace the cast, add in a very mediocre soundtrack, reduce the art a bit and you're done. Welcome to SYD. \r\nThe plot.Pure and innocent guy Tsuda transfers to an all-girl school to find out sex jokes do not get a 'what are you talking about o0..' reaction but rather 'I think it feels better there while doing ***' with serious face-- you get the idea. During the 13 episodes this series spans you will get coverage of all possible adult jokes you're going to hear on the short term. If you hear them that is, between all censoring and *bleep* words. And no, there will be no pantsu on the DVD either according to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I remembered about art and soundtrack is that some scenes were straight default H game rips, with the classroom at sunset with dramatic music to the school grounds and everything. \\n\r\nCharacters are there, but predictable. After two eps you can already tell in what state of mind corruption everyone is, not a bad thing since that's all what matters here.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, watch SYD for the following reasons:\\n\\n\r\n1.) Test if your mindset is past the point of no return yet. \\n\r\nYou pass when you can guess how a joke is going to play out with a small hint. \\n\r\nYou fail when..well, you actually can't fail. 13 eps full of dirty jokes boast a pretty high success rate. If you are among the group that still has a pure mind after watching this, drop a line on my profile. I'll be waiting for you, my Savior.\\n\\n\r\n2.) You have spare time and need a good laugh. With BSDM Teddybears, no pantsu and vibrators from Santa pretty much everything passes by.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I took a long break from writing reviews. Does it show?",

            "content": "\"Oh god another harem anime revolving around one male student that transfers into an all girls school?\" If you're thinking this way before watching this anime let me tell you, it's absolutely not even close to that.\r\nThis anime completely ditched the female stereotypes of anime and created some of the most outrageous female characters. Also this series is not a harem for those of you who cling onto that clich\u00e9.\r\nThis anime revolves around sexual based humor, the amount of sexual innuendos and sexual jokes is just absurd and what's more surprising is they never come from the male character which you'd expect to be apervert, on the contrary, he's annoyed every single day by the amount of pervertedness existing in both the student council president and the school counsil secretary.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the show is pretty unusual for this type of humor which is the student council room, you'd expect them all to be strict people that set rules and punish those who don't follow them, well they also do that but the amount of immorality is defenitely not of a student counsil and that's what makes this show so entertaining. The jokes are creative and the atmosphere they're in  just makes the humor come out even more.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's start with all the aspects of the series so this can be a full review.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story (6/10)\\n\r\nI have a problem with this, although the show is entertaining and funny, there's no actual storyline happening, in fact, each episode could be devided into 2 or 3 different stories, even though each story is of course structured the events in each episode are pretty much randomly inserted and the focus of the show is really to just make people laugh with all the sexual innuendos. The humor was there, most defenitely but the fact that they focused more on that rather than building an actual story line let me kind of disappointed, it would have been very fullfiling to see character development and such but the truth is the episodes are just random even though they do follow a chrological order there's not many connecting elements which, for me is kind of a down side to this show, but nonetheless it gets a 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art (7/10)\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about this, the character design is pretty simple and since there's a lot of humor moments there's the use of chibi-like characters which fit into the atmosphere pretty well so i don't think they got the art wrong, it's adequate for this show, the colors are lively and overall nothing's really unproportional or bad looking, so a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound (7/10)\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about this, there's not that much music going on during the actual episode, the opening theme is pretty fitting, so is the ending, they're not songs that would pump me up and make me go \"Yes! it's starting!\" so judging only these facts i'll give it a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (9/10)\\n\r\nNow this, this is where this show gets all the points, the characters completely  destroy the usual stereotypes of anime such as innocent girls and an ultra perverted guy who wants to create a harem, if you want a reference i'd say this anime is like the opposite of \"Seitokai No Ichizon\". You have 3 girls in the student council and 1 guy. The president is a dominant freak who misunderstands everyhting and turns it into something sexual, she's  constantly proposing weird stuff in the council meetings which pretty much don't even mix with whhat a student council is supposed to do. Then we have the secretary, a nice looking \"onee-chan\" type character, but don't let this fool you, she's the most perverted of all of them, she's a rich girl who freely talks about everything including the fact she uses tampons. Then we have the \"loli\" member of the council, probably one of the smartest and has a huge complex with her height, she's more of a stereotype but nonetheless she's a character that doesn't really understand what's going on when the others talk about bras,tampons, etc. And then we have our poor guy, forced to join the council as soon as he enters the now co-ed school and is the only guy who makes the others come to their senses, he's the opposite of a pervert and feels offended every time the girls turn him into a sexual object. The enjoyment of the show is the mixture between the girl's pervertedness and the guy's replies to those, that's what creates a humurous atmosphere and for that reason the characters get a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\nThis is a series to make you laugh, not to create an emotional attachement with the viewers. The humour is based off of almost only sexual jokes and innuendos and for the right audience this can be pretty entertaining but be warned if you don't like pervertedness, especially in girls, this is not the right show for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nOverall  this series is one of those you watch  on your free time or a series to bright up your day after a more intense anime, it's supposed to make you laugh if you have a perverted mind but beware this is not ecchi based, there's no pantsu or oppai this is really just revolving around sexual jokes and innuendos although of course some revolve around breasts and panties there's no actual breasts or panties on-screen. The characters will defenitely motivate you if you're into this type of humour because they're just so unique and i promise you this will make you laugh if you don't have an innocent mind. \\n",

            "content": "-This review has been updated after all the episodes were aired, and was first written while the show was airing.  It is meant to help the reader determine if it is worthwhile watching an episode or two to form their own opinions.-\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo is a school comedy with little or no relevant story that focuses largely on verbal adult humor, generally avoiding visual adult humour. As with most shows of this genre, it isn\u2019t mind-blowing or beautiful \u2013 throughout the show I found myself noticing little aspects that the show could have done without. \r\nHowever, at the end of the each episode, I lookedback and realized that I had laughed throughout. I had realized that the show may not be spectacular, but it was funny. The randomness and quick pacing of the humor is vital to the show's appeal, and the show begins to settle into a quick, smooth pace after a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is important to note is that this humor will not be for everyone, and after two episodes the viewer should be able to decide whether or not they enjoy the type of humor enough to continue on with the show.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork & Sound: Average; nothing worth highlighting, nothing negative. It is worth mentioning that the Ending song is very catchy, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in Seitokai Yakuindomo are not terribly unique. Each character can be summed up as having some of the usual generic characteristics normally found in anime. However, the characters fit into their roles well, and it is because of this the humor succeeds.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The enjoyment of this show is what carries my generally favorable review of it (especially as the show progresses into its later episodes). At the end of the episode, you may not walk away amazed, but you will walk away with a few good laughs.",

            "content": "Is it possible to make a comedy revolving almost exclusively around sex jokes, and not have it come off low-brow and immature? \r\nThe answer? Seitokai Yakuindomo.\r\nThanks to clever wordplay, good writing and actual punch lines, Seitokai Yakuindomo manages to craft a sex comedy that avoids the pitfall of simply being crass for the sake of crassness and is all the more funnier for it. No matter how many jokes about ejaculation they make. By taking their sex jokes down the path of wordplay and and humorous misunderstandings, (instead of making shallow references to dicks and expecting the audience fall over dead from laughter), Seitokai Yakuindomoalmost manages to give itself a sense of class. Almost. But more importantly, this makes the gags actually funny. \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, those who hate sex jokes, or the easily offended, probably won't enjoy Seitokai Yakuindomo. And yet somehow, the show manages to not be ridiculously offensive, despite containing gags that would make South Park blush. I think this is combination of the way the jokes are presented in an innocent, serious way (sort of like the characters are unaware what they're saying is inappropriate for the situation, if that makes sense) and the colourful cheery art style.\\n\\n\r\nThis series makes no bones about what is is, that is, it's nothing more than a platform for a rapid-fire series of sex jokes, and at this, I feel it's a flying success. The show is absolutely hilarious, which is all it needs to be. As a result, there's very little I can criticize it for. It's only real flaw is the length, only thirteen episodes, which is average for most anime, but for Seitokai Yakuindomo, it feels like this isn't enough and it has more jokes to tell. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a decent plot or a nice story, go somewhere else. Seitokai Yakuindomo doesn't have either of it. Seitokai Yakuindomo is about an all-girls school turned co. The girls don\u2019t really mind this though; it\u2019s more like a dream come true for most of them. Through the whole series it\u2019s one perverted joke after the other. Most of them you can see coming from a mile away, but they will make you laugh anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation often switches between normal animation and chibi mode. Usually I don\u2019t like it when there\u2019s too much chibi in an anime, but with Seitokai Yakuindomo I didn't really mind. Perhaps it\u2019s because I put my mind on blank while watching this.\\n\\n\r\nMusic fits the series perfectly, especially the dynamic, rhythmic and crazy, and a phenomenal opening and twisted ending. Because of the dialogue and humour it's difficult to pay attention to music in the background, but there are some good pieces. Very well emphasizes moral and peaceful moments in the series.\\n\\n\r\nI generally like the different characters in Seitokai Yakuindomo. I guess they\u2019re actually not that different (they\u2019re all perverted girls), but two of our main characters are normal people, trying to put some common sense in most of the school. The interaction between these is the main power of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Seitokai Yakuindomo is an excellent comedy series, provided you don't find it's lewd subjects offensive, and you don't mind that there's very little story. Anyone who loves a well-written sex comedy should check it out.\\n\\n\r\nI probably only enjoyed this because of my young age and immaturity, that's right all you pedophiles. COME AT ME BRO.\\n\r\nI mean I'm a masochist. \\n\r\nWait what.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that Seitokai Yakuindomo is probably right up there on the top 5 anime to have me in hysterics every 5 minutes or so, if you're looking for an anime full of laughs, simple characters and no emotional story so there's no drama, this is EXACTLY what you're looking for, if you're looking for romance, ecchi, love triangles, drama, sadness etc, you should probably give this a miss, although there are vague hints of love interest.\r\nThe story revolves around Takotoshi Tsuda, A male high school student who decides to transfer to an all-girls school simply because its closer to home,he ends up being forcibly recruited into the student body council as a male representative. He is joined by three girls;\\n\\n\r\nShino Amakusa - a second-year student and student body president, she is very serious and wants things done perfectly, she excels in academics, but all that is shadowed by the fact that she is a complete pervert, and the main reason she took an interest to Takotoshi was to 'examine' him in Health and Social class (Yep, you know exactly where i'm going with this), she is very self conscious about her breast size, and the fact her secretary, Aria, is well endowed, is the recipe for a perfect jealousy driven relationship between the two.\\n\\n\r\nAria Shichijo - Also a second year, she plays the role of the student body secretary, she comes from a very rich family and just by appearance you'd expect her to be the most mature character...and if you make that assumption, you're horribly wrong.\\n\r\nAria is extremely perverted too, more than Shino is, she manages to twist and turn even the most innocent and simplest of sentences into a fanfiction-esque scene which appear in thought bubbles, because she is absurdly rich and well pampered, she often finds herself in completely ridiculous situations, such as standing blankly in front of a door expecting it to slide open, or standing on the bottom step of a staircase thinking its an elevator. She too is incredibly smart, and is ranked second, underneath Shino, of course, in her class midterms.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we have Suzu Hagimura, who is in the same year as our unfortunate protagonist, again, she is very smart and often brags about her ability to do 10 digit arithmetic calculations in her head to cover up the fact she's not really good at any physical activities, although she is 16 years old and considers her self to be superior to Takotoshi, she is often the butt of the joke when it comes to childlike appearance and height as she is less than half the size of the other three and in one episode, needs a chair to reach the top shelf of her own cabinet, this often causes her to go into a super-saiyan rage whenever her unnaturally small stature is brought into a conversation, and of course, Takotoshi is the straight man for them all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i like about this show is that all the characters have their own traits , pros and cons which make them completely different from one another, although these characters aren't well flushed out with heaps of back story and social problems (they don't need to be for this genre of anime) the characters end up being likeable anyway, whether its for the witty banter between them in literally EVERY scene, or whether its the shear pervertedness of Shino and Aria (especially Aria, damn man) its definitely a must watch.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime to anyone, especially to fans of K-On! or Lucky Star (although the themes in this are significantly more mature than anything in K-On! and Lucky Star)\\n\\n\r\nThankyou for reading, message me an anime you want me to review and have a good day!\\n\\n\r\n-Matty",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuin domo: The Show Prison School and Shimoneta Wanted To Be! \r\nPreface:\r\nThe Japanese school setting + student council + all girl's school with few male entrants + perverted characters + ecchi/fanservice/nudity/andor harem is a really tired, really overdone concept at this point. For example: there have been at least 20 such shows involving at least 2 of the aforementioned tropes just THIS year. Count 'em. \r\nThe reason that there are currently so many of these shows is less that they're a real \"work\" and more of a \"product\" designed and marketed specifically to an audience that consistently and routinely purchases their product in largequantities. It's like the cigarette of anime. They're not good for you, but a lot of people really love them, and keep on buying it even though they know it's killing them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever- even the most cynical reviewers among us eventually realize that even the most recycled concepts and tropes can still make for an effective and enjoyable show... IF executed properly. Though Seitokai Yakuin domo includes all of the above with the exception of the last trope I mentioned, the writers took the established tropes and turned them upside down, adding some freshness to a nauseatingly stale formula. It's all about turning that \"girls can't be pervs\" trope upside down, and in that regard- a great success!\\n\\n\r\nEven though it's a comedy- I only laughed out loud one time at Seitokai Yakuin domo. It's kind of like The Big Lebowski (or any Coen Brothers' film for that matter) in that it's not actually funny at all. \\n\\n\r\nIt's entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a chuckle comedy- not an uproarious, couch clutching, gasping for breath humor riot. They do tend to wear out the jokes after a while, and if you never found them funny in the first place (like in Prison School), then you're in for a long watch. \\n\\n\r\nIf incessant panty shots and boobs are your main attraction to these shows, SYD is NOT for you. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation/Sound/Voice Acting: 7\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, I really only watched this show because it was animated by GoHands, and it looks like most anime made in this decade: shiny, colorful, and pretty fluid. One thing I noticed (and liked about this anime) was that nobody had ridiculous hairstyles NOR did they have unnatural hair colors. Everyone actually looked like a normal human being, which, for a school anime, is a HUGE step. +1 for progressiveness. \\n\\n\r\nThe voices are handled competently, veteran Yoko Hikasa (Rias Gremory) was great as Shino, and Satomi Arai plays the deadpan creeper Hata (She also portrayed Saotome from the more recent Shimoneta, a very similar character hmmmmmmmmm)\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nSYD was adapted from a long running 4 panel comic that's essentially just a collection of making fun of trope scenes from other anime, along with their own flavor of sex jokes. That said, it's difficult to take 30 or 40 four panel one liner jokes and turn that into a single episode. GoHands somehow manages to make it flow into an easy to follow comedy show about life in the student council with this pretty radical choppy pace coupled with segments that take the original jokes and expound upon them. They added a lot more context and setup, and then let it play out. \\n\\n\r\nYou're actually shown the punchline as a commercial slide, and then the scene plays out, giving you something to chew on and wonder where this weird, out of context line comes from. It definitely helps with the impact as well- kind of an \"OHHHH\" moment for the longer jokes.\\n\\n\r\nThe general premise of SYD is that Tsuda, our MC, is a newly accepted student to the formerly all girls Ousai Academy. On his first day, he makes the mistake of not tightening his tie, which attracts the ire of the Student Council President, Shino- who teaches him a lesson by fixing his tie, strangling him, and then forcibly inducts him into the Student Council. The rest of the show takes place over the school year, with the various holidays, sex jokes, outings, gross out jokes, and mischief that come along with it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nThere are four student council members, President Shino, VP Tsuda, Secretary Aria, and Treasurer Suzu. There're also four other characters of note: the creepy lady teacher Yokoshima, who is basically a pedophile and tries incessantly to get with the few guys attending the school, Hata, the monotone speaking newspaper club member who always shows up to take scandalous and incriminating photos of everyone, Mitsuba, the adorably innocent (of the horrible sexual things Aria and Shino say) Judo girl, and Kaede, who is man-phobic. \\n\\n\r\nEach character has an in show 4th wall breaking description: Shino, \"the perfect human\" (who is an incorrigible pervert), Aria, \"the multitalented princess with big boobs\" (rich girl airhead everyone fawns over, also a pervert), and Suzu \"IQ of 180\" (height of 4'5\", terrible napoleon complex and hates being treated like a child). Tsuda, our MC, is basically the world's most legendary straight man. He serves for there to be a brick wall to hit for the endless stream of sex and poop jokes coming from Shino/Aria. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe actual content of the jokes is what I referred to as refreshing in the beginning. I have not seen an anime with such disgusting, foul content toilet jokes since Panty and Stocking. It goes so overboard with perversion of speech and dirty jokes + toilet humor that it's not even scandalous anymore, it's commonplace. You know, without a doubt, that everything that comes out of Shino's or Aria's mouths is going to be a) a bad sex joke, b) a women's hygiene gross out joke, or c) some \"accidental\" misreading/pronunciation of a normal kanji that then turns the meaning into something sexual. \\n\\n\r\nWhile these are fairly common in comedy anime, again, the degree to which they describe some of this stuff is pretty nasty, so +1 for edgy. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nWell, this ran a lot longer than I wanted it to- but it's important to see more formative shows in genre tropes- and one can see the obvious influences this show (and the comics before it) had on such newer titles as Prison School and Shimoneta. \\n\\n\r\nAria: \"Wow, a whole year has passed. It only felt like a few months.\"\\n\r\nShino: \"In an anime, that'd be about 13 episodes!\"\\n\r\nTsuda: \"That's a little too dangerous...\"",

            "content": "I have seen over 300 different Anime over the years, including notably terrible Anime, like Shingetsutan Tsukihime, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, Umineko no Naku Koro ni, Mars of Destruction, Xenosaga: The Animation, Mahou Sensei Negima and InuYasha, and I can safely say that Seitokai Yakuindomo is the absolute worst Anime I have ever seen. \r\nI rarely drop Anime, even the worst ones. I usually complete an Anime no matter how bad it is, just so I can tell people \"Don't watch this Anime, it's terrible\" with a completely unbiased opinion. However, Seitokai Yakuindomo is SO BAD that I couldn't hold out for any longerthan episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo is the worst kind of Anime, pandering to the worst kind of Anime \"fan\" (I use quotations because you are no kind of Anime fan if you enjoy crap like this), a shallow \"comedy\" (I use quotations because it's not funny) that focuses on fanservice and repetitive sex-related \"jokes\" that only the most immature, sexually depraved teenagers could possibly enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no comedy to be found here. Every single \"joke\" is pulled from the same gutter, oftentimes using the exact same \"joke\" multiple times in an episode. Then again, you can barely call them jokes. Here, let me rewrite this paragraph again below, in the style of Seitokai Yakuindomo's \"jokes\", to give you an idea of what to expect.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no S&M to be found here. Every single penis is pulled from the same condom, oftentimes using the exact same penis multiple times in a vagina. Then again, you can barely call them dicks. Here, let me molest this virgin again below, in the style of Seitokai Yakuindomo's period, to give you an idea of what to fuck.\\n\\n\r\nThat wasn't funny, was it? Why, that was offensive, wasn't it? It sounded like shameless pandering to perverted, immature teenagers, didn't it? Well, guess what? That is exactly what Seitokai Yakuindomo's dialog is like. This is Seitokai Yakuindomo's idea of a \"joke\", which it will use in every single scene despite the fact that it wasn't funny the first time, much less the dozens of other times. \\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutely no reason to watch Seitokai Yakuindomo, it's just plain bad. There's no way to argue it, you cannot possibly gain any sort of enjoyment from watching it. And, well, if you THINK you enjoy Seitokai Yakuindomo, well, you're probably 12 years old and think it's funny to draw dicks in your math book. \\n\\n\r\nAt least the opening and ending themes are pretty good.",

            "content": "Before you go all harem on this show, just think back to your blooming adolescent and teenage years. For boys and girls alike, wasn't your mind constantly filled with inappropriate thoughts? There wasn't much of a trigger to set you off; testosterone and estrogen are powerful little demons. So instead of marketing those stupidly impossible innocent anime girls other series seem so fond of, why not appeal potty humor to a wider audience that each individual has, at one point, experienced? I may not know much about how the opposite gender thinks, but for us guys, certain thoughts flit about our heads like angry bees,never leaving us alone. This may all seem off-topic, Seitokai Yakuindomo delivers the highest of quality of sexual jokes, all while incorporating a storyline and masterfully pulling off a non-harem, hilarious and wonderfully executed anime. \\n\\n\r\n Story: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple: an all girl high school recently became co-ed. STOP. Before you go further, isn't your first automatic judgement to insult another hentai-style slice of life anime? Of course! Any sane person would. A friendly, non-perverted guy by the name of Tsuda enters the school, unwittingly tripping off Shina Amakasu and the rest of the all-girl student. After some misunderstandings, randomness and hilarity, he is forced into the student council - with gratifying results. \\n\\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong, haters may understand that these sort of anime don't have a storyline. Most of the time, they're right. Here, it does apply somewhat; a frilly way to tell a story, so to speak. However, I had a wonderful time watching the student council do their every day activities - with a twist. These aren't your normal, typical, average, innocent virgin high school girls; these are some of the craziest anime girls I've ever come across. There seems to be no end to the jokes and innuendoes; and interestingly enough, TSUDA (THE GUY, FOR FREAKING SAKE) is the innocent one. What in all that is mighty in the anime world has this come to? A guy? As the sole non-perverted rock amid this flood of girls? This anime was so different, I was instantly hooked - and so should you be.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was gorgeous and bright. I typically don't like overdone scenes or underdone scenes, and this didn't disappoint me in the lease. There were times when they decided to go for the chibi look randomly and drew the characters innocently - an interesting juxtaposition, because while in chibi mode the characters decided to say funny little innuendos.... Ah well. Enough gushing. What I didn't like? Sometimes the artwork borderlined porn. No way out of that... I mean, it looked fine and all, but trying watching those scenes while there are young people around you! Geez, put some CLOTHES ON. But seriously, even then the artwork never dipped below par.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED. Wow. What an upbeat, fantastical way of starting an anime. The OP was perfect and catchy, on my ipod in seconds, and the ED was.....weird. Sorta serious, sorta not. The background music melded perfectly with the on-screen mood, but in and of itself I was not impressed as much. Though I know I repeat this in my other reviews, but seriously, pay attention to the voice acting. Try acting out those scenes by yourself. It's not easy; but when you can make perverted jokes into a mic without eliciting even a laugh, that takes some guts. The voices were spot on, serious and joking, warm and memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLovely, lovely cast. Perfect for the story, each character represented a typical sort of archetype. Tsuda, the innocent one; Hagimiru, the tsundere, the list goes on and on. Each character had their moments and contributed a little more to the story; even Tsuda's little ball of comedy managed to get a good laugh out of me. But seriously, I loved each and every character, because they simply melded so perfectly. It's so hard to imagine a different cast or to introduce another main character, because the magic happened with this perfect combination. It wasn't perfect; there were some stupid parts (even the best cake may be too sweet for some people), but overall, it was beautiful to see the interactions take place. Though there wasn't much of a character arc at all for anyone, I enjoyed their daily banter nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy is the average score so low? Many people looked past what this anime was really trying to go for (toilet humor) and just hit it with a low score and moved on. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy; if you watch the first episode and grudgingly try and finish it, you're experience won't be nearly as pleasant than if you were to go into watching each episode with enthusiasm and a piece of pie. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short but sweet little 13 episode anime. Don't look at the superficial, shallow characteristics; dig a little deeper, and what you'll find may actually not be a condom but a vibrating Christmas present...",

            "content": "\"Dick-jokes the anime\", these were the words that got me interested in this show, and it I couldn't describe it any better. It starts off seeming like a typical romcam/harem, but Seitokai Yakuindomo has its own unique genre of humor that sets it apart from the norm. \r\nAs a show with constant references to dildos, cum, sex, incest, boobs, panties, dicks and literally everything dirty you can honestly think of, in a show about high school girls, you would think this would be ecchi, but it's not. It's a slice of life anime with some of the most creative and unique comedy I have everseen. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around the typical harem lead male surrounded by beautiful girls (The school is 95% women), but the great thing about it is that each girl represents a porn category/fetish. Notable one's include incest, extreme fetishes, innocent/amateur, voyeur, midget, and milf, but the list goes on. They all have amazing personalities that compliment their \"role\" in the show's twisted sense of humor. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing is excellent, I find myself occasionally bored but more often than not I was laughing my ass off. The jokes are generally creative, and some scenes are almost impossible not to laugh. If you find immature humor funny, such as the type of stuff you might see in Gintama, this is a show made for you.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side, arguably this shows weakest point is its lack of story. It heavily reminds me of something like Kiss x Sis in that regard, it has some minor plot regarding entrance exams but for the most part every episode feels like an OVA, and the episodes themselves are so fragmented that it can sometimes be hard to follow. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, as mentioned already there times where the humor does get a little stale, since it is basically sex jokes as far as the eye can see. Sometimes the humor feels forced and the jokes are word for word repeats of previous episodes. These are few and far between but keep this in mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, by now you should know whether or not you'll like it. Perverted humor is not for everyone, but if you enjoy it, this show has made a science out of it.",

            "content": "What comes to mind when you think about high school girls? No, I\u2019m not talking about perverted stuff, but rather how they act. Most of us think that high school girls are shy, oversensitive and keep to themselves and that\u2019s pretty much how they\u2019re depicted in a lot of media these days, especially in anime. Seitokai Yakuindomo shows us a different side of modern teenagers and brings lots of humour and parody with it.\r\nBasically, Seitokai Yakuindomo is about a teenager named Tsuda Takatoshi who decides to attend Ousai Academy due to the fact that it\u2019s close to his home, even though this particular high schoolused to be a former all-girls\u2019 academy up until recently. During his very first day at school, Tsuda meets a couple of girls who turn out to be members of the student council. Some of them are actually quite perverted and often spurt out the dirtiest jokes, but what\u2019s worse is that they recruit Tsuda into the student council and even go as far as to make him vice-president. This all happens in a matter of minutes and our unfortunate hero has little say in any of it.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the thirteen episodes of Seitokai Yakuindomo you\u2019ll be constantly bombarded with dirty sex jokes, perverted talk and unwanted information about the female body and their period cycle. There are little to no serious scenes in the entire anime and most of it comprises of convenient situations to score another sex joke or a dirty conversation, with Tsuda often used as a serious retort or an enraged response.\\n\\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t too many characters in the anime, though most of them are put to good use and no of them feel forced or useless. You\u2019ve got the protagonist, Tsuda Takatoshi who just wants to lead a normal life and high school but is constantly attacked by his fellow female students with dirty jokes and unwarranted accusations. Then there are the three other members of the student council, all female, obviously. Shino Amakusa is the president of the council and maybe the most perverted of all characters, always available when you need a quick dirty joke. Aria Shichijou is the mature rich girl, though her mind is just about as perverted as that of Shino\u2019s. Last but not least, yet definitely the shortest, is Suzu Hagimura, the intelligent and silent girl. She is about the same age as Tsuda, but has the body of an elementary school student. You won\u2019t get any dirty comments from her, but her short height will often be used as comic relief and target of several jokes.\\n\\n\r\nSeitokai certainly works well as a comedy and its non-stop approach at humour and constant verbal gags keeps every episode fun and entertaining. What the anime lacks in proficiency it makes up for with its engaging plot and easy-going nature. It\u2019s definitely not a great series and apart from an episode that takes place on the beach or another one where our heroes celebrate Christmas, Seitokai Yakuindomo lacks diversity. Most of the anime takes place at the academy, namely inside a couple of rooms and on a corridor. Whenever our characters are taken in a different location, it\u2019s often only so as to set up a joke or make a funny remark at something in that particular environment. Another weak point is that every episode seems to be cut down in short scenes, each about one minute, that feature some random dialogue between a couple of our characters followed by one or two dirty jokes. Every scene starts with a build-up to the future joke or gag and usually ends directly after its purpose has been complete and the laughs and giggles have taken place.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s rather hard to predict if you\u2019ll like Seitokai Yakuindomo or not. Some will be drawn to it by its simple premise and fast pacing while others are going to be turned off by the overwhelming amount of sex jokes and weird character interactions. I really didn\u2019t know what to make this series during the first few episodes and I simply couldn\u2019t connect with certain scenes, which in the ended left an awkward impression on me. I got used to it eventually and after a while each episode turned out to be even funnier than the last one. It\u2019s not an anime that I\u2019ll remember for too long, though. It all comes down to what you\u2019re looking for: there are enough laughs to be had in Seitokai Yakuindomo and it\u2019s rarely boring or changing pace, so you can hardly go wrong with it. If you\u2019re looking for a little more substance, on the other hand, then I advise you to keep on searching.",

The jokes are played well, the characters contribute well to the flow, and it seems to carry a universal appeal.

And in the biggest part that's because this is an Anime of 2010. You'll enjoy watching the art which is present in this Anime, because it's a very good one. All emotions and feelings are expressed very well on the characters' faces.\r\nSTORY: 9\r\nThis Anime has a very original story and characters. There are no other Anime titles which have such plot. A guy, who recently changed his place of living, tranfers to a school which just changed from a girls'one to a co-ed and now it's still full of girls. Don't think bad about him! He's not a pervert. The reason he did this, is because that school is near the house he lives in. In the moment he entered the school, he is noticed by the Student's Council President and is enrolled immediatly in Council. The reason of this action was the thing that \"school needed a male's point of view\" and she wanted opinions from a male's perspective. And after this, he gets through a lot of events with girls. Oh, I forgot to mention, Student's Council consists of 3 girls. The two of them are so perverted! I couldn't believe my eyes! I have never seen such perverted girls in my life! You'll laugh a lot! It's so funny!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the main characters are 3 girls from Student's Council and Tsuda that transfered there. Aria and Shino from Council are the most perverted girls you had ever saw. Suzu is a very wise one, but is considered to be a child because of her height and some of her habits. The main protagonist, Tsuda Takatoshi, is a normal boy like all of us, but not as perverted as some of us. I liked a lot how the President, Shino, behaves. She's so funny with all her erotic thoughts. If you like to watch comedy and funny Anime titles, then it's for you.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\\n\r\nI can't tell very much about this part of Anime, because you'll not have time to notice such things, 'cause you'll laugh a lot at some scenes.\\n\r\nThe OP & ED are good and they were chose very good to this Anime. Sound great characterizes  events that happen and emotions/ feelings that characters experience at that moments. Sound environment doesn't bother you, but suits very good this Anime!!!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERAGE: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very funny Anime you must watch if you would like to see what happens in a girls' only school with a perverted Student's Council President. You will laugh at her rules and actions. Also, in Anime are used uncensored words (like masturbation, anal/oral sex, vagina, etc.) that are censored due to the fact that it's a PG-13 rated Anime. I recommend you to watch Ayako release (the same I watched), because of some reasons: \\n\r\n1) Words that are audio-censored in Anime, are translated in subs, so you'll read the real things that are said. I mean, subs translate to you those things and you'll laugh more than if you'll watch a Raw (I mean, those who can).\\n\r\n2) This is a very good subgroup and you'll agree more with this after you'll watch this Anime.\\n\r\nThis subgroup translated all words with double-meaning (that are often used), where one meaning is perverted/erotic for sure. The fact is that the President, Shino, very often thinks about that one. Also, were translated all Japanese words that are related to Japanese culture/history and are known/used only in Japan. (For example, Nyotaimori is the practice using women's bodies as a serving dish, usually for sushi.) (would you like to try something like that with your loved one?  addressed to male part who reads this review).\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, watch this Anime ([Ayako] 720p release) for a good mood and AMAZING Impressions!!!!!",

            "content": "I told myself I'd write a review for Seitokai Yakuindomo immediately after finishing it, but eh, a couple weeks later is okay, right?\r\nStory: 6\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo's story is very clich\u00e9. A boy starts attending a school that used to be girls-only, he joins the student council, which has only female members--we've all heard it before etc, etc. If you're looking for epic plot and character development, look elsewhere, Seitokai Yakuindomo is good for laughs, not becoming a better human being, going on an adventure through anime, or other things like that; It's not even good for fapping. The reason I personally enjoyed Seitokai Yakuindomo was preciselythat. Seitokai Yakuindomo is perverted by all means, but it's in a different way than the majority of ecchi shows...It's actually funny. Throughout this 13-episode Seitokai no Ichizon lookalike, you'll actually laugh. The comedy ranges from simple comedic timing, to completely perverted jokes, to out-of-place 'wtf why is there a teddy bear with a ballgag?'. This show is a very fun watch, but I will tell you to steer clear of it if either of the following apply to you: 1) You're looking for something serious 2) You dislike anything remotely related to ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSYD's art is nothing amazing, but it's definitely nothing bad either. The animation is nice and flows smoothly and the characters are cute. Of course there is some censoring of certain.. objects.. but that doesn't take away from the show because you'll definitely know what they are. And it's not like there is any explicit ecchi content (as in naked people) to censor.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nIn terms of Seiyuu, SYD has decently popular voice actors. Shino and Aria are voiced by Hikasa Youko and Satou Satoumi (the voices of Mio and Ritsu of K-On!), respectively. And, my personal favorite, Arai Satomi (Kuroko from To Aru Majutsu no Index/To Aru Kagaku no Railgun) lends her voice to the expressionless newspaper club member, Hata Ranko. There are no complaints to be made about the voice acting in SYD, and hey, I like the opening as well. Osai Girls and Boys~!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters really make the show for me here. Well maybe not the characters, but the things that they say. Shino: tall blunt school prez, Aria: tall, busty Shirley-lookalike Ojou-sama, Suzu: genius loli Nagi-lookalike with a Napoleon complex, Tsuda: generic too nice anime lead. I just gave you a good idea of the characters you will encounter when watching Seitokai Yakuindomo, I'm sure they sound pretty much as generic as possible, but if you watch the show, I think you'll find that with good, entertaining writing, even the most generic characters can become hilarious. \\n\r\nAlso, an honourable mention to Yokoshima-sensei, she's awesome.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis is what made me continue to watch Seitokai Yakuindomo throughout summer 2010 season. The writing on this show is hilarious. I liked this show because I never knew what the characters were going to say next, but I knew whatever it was, it'd be funny. I laughed through every episode and you will too, as long as you don't fall into one of the 'do not watch' categories I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show to anyone who wants something that will make them laugh, doesn't mind pervertedness, and has free time on their hands. This show isn't a total /must see/, but if you enjoyed what I said about it in my review, I recommend checking it out :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "There seems to have been a lot of recent anime adapted from 4-koma mangas recently, Seitokai Yakuindomo (SYD for short) is one them.\r\n====================*WARNING*======================\r\n If you are the type of person who are not into constant sex related jokes and innuendos, then you can stop reading now, this anime is definitely is not for you.\r\n====================*WARNING*======================\r\nWith that said, let's move on.\r\nStory:\r\nThe main character, Takatoshi Tsuda, is forced into joining the student council of Ousai High School, which was formerly an all-girls school, by the president Akamusa Shino, in order to have a male's perspective into issues surrounding the new now co-ed school.\r\nThis being a 4-koma comedy, thereis pretty much nothing that you can call an overall plot whatsoever as the anime is based on the 4 student council members and the time they spend there.\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, at least 90% of the comedy in the series are all adult, sex-related jokes. It will be hard going into an episode and not hear the characters use words like cum, penis, vagina, dildo, masturbation, etc...you get the idea. The series tries to deliver the jokes in new and clever ways each time, but even then some people might find the show start to get repetitive and old pretty fast. That was not the case for me luckily.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhile the art is not outstanding, the series shines with a bright and vibrant colour scheme. The chibi-deformed versions of the characters look adorable, and overall the animation is easy on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the VAs do a respectable job in their roles, and with many well known voices in this series it all comes together nicely. In terms of BGM, its what you would expect from your standard comedy, high school anime, nothing really worth mentioning. The OP and ED themes however are surprisingly catchy and im still looping them even as I write this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs far as character goes, I think it was one of the more enjoyable aspects of SYD. While none of the characters are really unique and they all follow common stereotypes (Tsuda being the tsukomi, Aria is the rich girl who is ignorant about common things, Hagimura is the loli with a complex over it, and Shino is just Shino), they manage to blend together nicely and produce plenty of humorous events throughout the series, mainly because 90% of the cast are pretty much perverts. The side characters as well give the series an extra boost in comedy and many of them are likable. While romance is not the main focus of the series, by the later half of the series we are shown a bit of possible future relationship between Tsuda and some of the girls, in a show were everything is adult related comedy, its a rather nice addition and it doesnt derail the series' direction. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI will be the first to admit that I wasnt into the show for the first 3 or so episodes, I usually dont enjoy the animes that are mostly about perverted talk/actions (latest example: B Gata H Kei) but this show slowly won me over and ended up becoming the show I was anticipating the most this season for reasons I still havent figured out myself fully (maybe the characters). I can say for sure that this series does get better as it goes along, and it does not lose momentum from there (except maybe the last episode). \\n\\n\r\nOverall if you are looking for a series with a potty mouth, then you must not look any further than this. If you can giggle at jokes involving dildos, penis, erection, vagina, masturbation, etc...you will also find the comedy in this series to be pretty damn funny. And if you are not into this kind of stuff, maybe the small romance scenes in the latter half might keep you interested. Either way from the very beginning this series sets its target audience, and if you belong in this audience i doubt you will be disappointed. For those who just cannot enjoy a more \"dirty\" type of humour, then you are looking for the wrong anime. With hopes of a possible second season, I can say with confidence \"I love Ousai, I love SYD\".",

            "content": "Hello :3\r\nThis review is fully intended to all of you who's about to decide whether to watch this fine looking anime or not. Okay, so here goes...\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo tells us about a normal-looking guy who's going to spend his 3 years of high school in a former all-girls school which has just gone co-ed. Suddenly he got recruited by the student council on the first day of school. Things went smooth for him, and then at some point, romantic flags comes appearing out of nowhere just like a cliched rom-com anime. \r\nIf you think that's what going to happen in this anime, then you're ahundred percent wrong. \\n\\n\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo is actually about a group of student council of an all-girls school that has just turned into a co-ed school. This group consist of 4 people, 3 girls and a guy.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a diligent, smart, athletic president whose sex orientation is a bit screwed up, Amakusa Shino\\n\\n\r\nA beautiful, rich secretary whose having puberty problems just like the president, Shichijou Aria\\n\\n\r\nA tiny-looking girl who happens to be the treasurer, Hagimura Suzu\\n\\n\r\nAnd the normal, straight-man, main character, and also the vice president, Tsuda Takatoshi.\\n\\n\r\nEveryday in the student council room is day full of Tsuda's punchline reacting to the immaturity of Shino and Aria regarding sex. Anddd, sometimes it's just Suzu's insult to others when she's being teased tiny.\\n\\n\r\nOh, before I forgot, this is a gag anime which consist of serial short skits. This anime contains lots of jokes related to sex. I suggest you to be an adult to watch this, or at least have a sufficient knowledge of sex. Personally, I watched this when I was younger and found some \"things\" hard to understand, such as dildos, chasity belt, masturbation and other stuff which is a completely unsuitable for Justin Bieber.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really know if this could be considered funny or not. I mean, I laughed a bit, but so often it just keeps giving sex jokes which I couldn't really understand. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a rom-com anime, then you're definitely looking at the wrong place.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a comedy anime, I can't say that this anime is guaranteed to be funny, since some jokes are not for everybody.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I could say that if you're a person with a reasonable knowledge of sex, and also a reasonable sense of humor, Seitokai Yakuindomo is 'maybe' the right choice to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "SYD...if you're looking for a good laugh, this is definitely one of the best out there. Full of shocking and vulgar sex jokes, there is no filter on the mouths of these hilarious characters as they try to live the life of high school students while controlling their unmatched sex drives. \r\nStory (7/10): \r\nThe story itself is pretty simple. Tsuda Takatoshi is a new student at Ousai Academy and he is accidentally forced to join the student council (all girls) by day one. What he doesn't know is just how perverted the president and vice president are of this council. Whether it's discussing how toexperiment S&M on teddy bears or pester Takotshi about how many times he \"finishes\" per day, there is no rest for Takotshi as he tries to keep up with the seemingly unlimited energy of the council. \\n\r\nThe weakness of this kind of comedy, however, is that there really is no central plot. Each episode is self-contained and does nothing more than set up the situation for the jokes, so anyone looking for a profound story, a slice-of-life, or even a school romance will be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nGood animation. Nothing worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): \\n\r\nThought the opening and ending themes were pretty good. Nothing super spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10):\\n\r\nThere's no doubt these characters were hilarious. Coupled with Takatoshi and Hagimura's stunned reactions, these characters will keep you entertained from start to finish. Do not worry that the jokes are only sexual; they honestly don't get old. But this is all assuming we look at these characters from a comedic perspective. Once again, there aren't any deep background stories or in-depth looks at their personal struggles; this is no slice-of-life. It is pure comedy.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nI thought this show was hysterical. I never found the jokes repetitive since they were so shocking; unfiltered vulgarity  has its own charm. Even if you're not a fan of sexual jokes, I suggest you give this type of humor a try. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\r\nApproach this show as if you would approach a stand-up comedy: don't expect any deep stories, expect comedy and you will receive.  \\n",

This all base on my opinion, so even if I like or hate it, you still might love this series.  :)  I just love writing reviews.  I gave it a 8 on Story mostly because there is only 2 episodes out and I do not know what the plot will be.  So far, this show is pure comical action through perverted jokes made my the Shino (Mio from K-on!) and Aria (Ritsu from K-on!).  Now however, if some of you guys are watching it for Yoko and Satomi, sadlyAria has more of a higher voice than Ritsu and Shino, is well more perverted than Mio will ever be. lol Their characters are nothing similar.\\n\\n\r\nI like all the character personality, since it's comedy, I expect them to make me laugh, or at least make me smile lol.  Anyways, so far the jokes aren't bad, but I hope they don't rely solely on perverted jokes alone.  I didn't really like it the first time I watched it because after watching K-on... it threw me off that Mio's voice was a perverted personality lol.  So watch the first episode, and try to erase Mio's character.  You might enjoy the perverted comedy, or maybe you may pass :)",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo (SYD): Student Council mixed with a lot of sex related jokes\r\nThe series starts with a normal male student Tsuda Takatoshi who is about to start his first year at Ousai Academy but on his first day he pretty much forced into the student council and that's when the fun starts. After that you see what happens in the student council, the adventures they go on and the time they spend together\r\nAlthough this anime has no plot (because of it's genre), it was really enjoyable (if you are into sex related jokes).  About 90-95% of the jokes in this anime were sex-related andthey had me laughing a lot even though I find them somewhat repetitive.  The concept of this anime seems really simple but it works.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't anything too special, we got Shino the student body president, who is perfect (except for that one flaw), Aria the rich girl, Suzu the loli and a whole bunch of minor characters.  Sure the characters might not be unique but they all fit into their roles and that's all I ask for.  In this kind of anime there really wouldn't be any character development but there are one or two love interests flying around, but the anime isn't really too heavy on it, I guess it's because of the genre. However it would be nice if they did have some romance but I guess that's asking for too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is clear and they do have some moments where the characters are in chibi version but nothing too special and nothing negative either\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound there is nothing too special here either, the voice actors are alright and I would say fit the role, the OP and ED songs are at par.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this series quite a bit, I got to say this is one of the funniest anime series I've watched this year.  If you're not into sex-related jokes then I would bypass this anime but if you just want a laugh like me I recommend SYD. Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "If something came to me after watching Setokai Yakuindomo (SYD) it was that I never figured out if the male lead is gay or not. That, and the fact society sure is changing fast these days. Maybe GoHands was better off restoring their mistake and making Princess Lover into a H series again.\r\nSummarizing this series, let's take B Gata H Kei as example. Remove the shyness about adult subjects and instead make it the most common subject to talk about in the world. Replace the cast, add in a very mediocre soundtrack, reduce the art a bit and you're done. Welcome to SYD. \r\nThe plot.Pure and innocent guy Tsuda transfers to an all-girl school to find out sex jokes do not get a 'what are you talking about o0..' reaction but rather 'I think it feels better there while doing ***' with serious face-- you get the idea. During the 13 episodes this series spans you will get coverage of all possible adult jokes you're going to hear on the short term. If you hear them that is, between all censoring and *bleep* words. And no, there will be no pantsu on the DVD either according to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I remembered about art and soundtrack is that some scenes were straight default H game rips, with the classroom at sunset with dramatic music to the school grounds and everything. \\n\r\nCharacters are there, but predictable. After two eps you can already tell in what state of mind corruption everyone is, not a bad thing since that's all what matters here.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, watch SYD for the following reasons:\\n\\n\r\n1.) Test if your mindset is past the point of no return yet. \\n\r\nYou pass when you can guess how a joke is going to play out with a small hint. \\n\r\nYou fail when..well, you actually can't fail. 13 eps full of dirty jokes boast a pretty high success rate. If you are among the group that still has a pure mind after watching this, drop a line on my profile. I'll be waiting for you, my Savior.\\n\\n\r\n2.) You have spare time and need a good laugh. With BSDM Teddybears, no pantsu and vibrators from Santa pretty much everything passes by.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I took a long break from writing reviews. Does it show?",

            "content": "\"Oh god another harem anime revolving around one male student that transfers into an all girls school?\" If you're thinking this way before watching this anime let me tell you, it's absolutely not even close to that.\r\nThis anime completely ditched the female stereotypes of anime and created some of the most outrageous female characters. Also this series is not a harem for those of you who cling onto that clich\u00e9.\r\nThis anime revolves around sexual based humor, the amount of sexual innuendos and sexual jokes is just absurd and what's more surprising is they never come from the male character which you'd expect to be apervert, on the contrary, he's annoyed every single day by the amount of pervertedness existing in both the student council president and the school counsil secretary.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the show is pretty unusual for this type of humor which is the student council room, you'd expect them all to be strict people that set rules and punish those who don't follow them, well they also do that but the amount of immorality is defenitely not of a student counsil and that's what makes this show so entertaining. The jokes are creative and the atmosphere they're in  just makes the humor come out even more.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's start with all the aspects of the series so this can be a full review.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story (6/10)\\n\r\nI have a problem with this, although the show is entertaining and funny, there's no actual storyline happening, in fact, each episode could be devided into 2 or 3 different stories, even though each story is of course structured the events in each episode are pretty much randomly inserted and the focus of the show is really to just make people laugh with all the sexual innuendos. The humor was there, most defenitely but the fact that they focused more on that rather than building an actual story line let me kind of disappointed, it would have been very fullfiling to see character development and such but the truth is the episodes are just random even though they do follow a chrological order there's not many connecting elements which, for me is kind of a down side to this show, but nonetheless it gets a 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art (7/10)\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about this, the character design is pretty simple and since there's a lot of humor moments there's the use of chibi-like characters which fit into the atmosphere pretty well so i don't think they got the art wrong, it's adequate for this show, the colors are lively and overall nothing's really unproportional or bad looking, so a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound (7/10)\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about this, there's not that much music going on during the actual episode, the opening theme is pretty fitting, so is the ending, they're not songs that would pump me up and make me go \"Yes! it's starting!\" so judging only these facts i'll give it a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (9/10)\\n\r\nNow this, this is where this show gets all the points, the characters completely  destroy the usual stereotypes of anime such as innocent girls and an ultra perverted guy who wants to create a harem, if you want a reference i'd say this anime is like the opposite of \"Seitokai No Ichizon\". You have 3 girls in the student council and 1 guy. The president is a dominant freak who misunderstands everyhting and turns it into something sexual, she's  constantly proposing weird stuff in the council meetings which pretty much don't even mix with whhat a student council is supposed to do. Then we have the secretary, a nice looking \"onee-chan\" type character, but don't let this fool you, she's the most perverted of all of them, she's a rich girl who freely talks about everything including the fact she uses tampons. Then we have the \"loli\" member of the council, probably one of the smartest and has a huge complex with her height, she's more of a stereotype but nonetheless she's a character that doesn't really understand what's going on when the others talk about bras,tampons, etc. And then we have our poor guy, forced to join the council as soon as he enters the now co-ed school and is the only guy who makes the others come to their senses, he's the opposite of a pervert and feels offended every time the girls turn him into a sexual object. The enjoyment of the show is the mixture between the girl's pervertedness and the guy's replies to those, that's what creates a humurous atmosphere and for that reason the characters get a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\nThis is a series to make you laugh, not to create an emotional attachement with the viewers. The humour is based off of almost only sexual jokes and innuendos and for the right audience this can be pretty entertaining but be warned if you don't like pervertedness, especially in girls, this is not the right show for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nOverall  this series is one of those you watch  on your free time or a series to bright up your day after a more intense anime, it's supposed to make you laugh if you have a perverted mind but beware this is not ecchi based, there's no pantsu or oppai this is really just revolving around sexual jokes and innuendos although of course some revolve around breasts and panties there's no actual breasts or panties on-screen. The characters will defenitely motivate you if you're into this type of humour because they're just so unique and i promise you this will make you laugh if you don't have an innocent mind. \\n",

            "content": "One of the very few cases where explaining things is a BAD idea.\r\nAn anime focusing on comedy, Seitokai Yakuindomo is a highschool story where the straight man Tsuda, one of the first male students of the up-till-then female-only school, is forced to become a part of the student council, since the president (Shino) has decided that she needs a male's opinion in managing the now-both-sexes school. Along with her are the secretary, Aria, and the adorable blonde loli Suzu. \r\nThat said, from the start Seitokai shows clearly that it isn't interested in promoting any sort of story and each episode after the first is astandalone excuse for hilarity to ensue. The anime hits us with one sex joke and gag after another, with the occasional trolling by the animation team spicing things up (for example fake last episodes, game and movie announcements etc etc). Overall I am totally in for this sort of mindless fun. The gags focus mostly on Suzu's height and all sorts of pervertidness (hell, the only scene where they show the girls naked is just an excuse for another gag.)\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that I quite often caught myself FORCING myself to laugh at the jokes, and when you do this long enough to realise it on your own, something, dear animators, has gone wrong. See the dialogue below from ep 11 and you'll understand:\\n\\n\r\nPresident:I really hate wearing skirts on windy days.\\n\r\nSex-crazed secretary:You shouldn't say that indiscriminately...\\n\r\nSex-crazed secretary (cont): You can legitimately expose yourself!\\n\\n\r\nSee the problem with the above dialogue? You read the first 2 lines and leave your imagination to do the work, which in turns leads you to laughter. But when they add an explanation of the joke on the third line it just ruins it. This is the one rule that Seitokai Yakuindomo always fails to realise: NEVER EXPLAIN THE JOKE. Implications are far more hilarious than going to someone and saying: \"HERE! THIS IS WHAT I MEANT WITH THAT JOKE! DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW AUDIENCE?\" Apart from ruining the mood it also feels like the show is insulting our IQs on purpose. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end I can't really hate Seitokai though. With every episode I get the sweet wonderful feeling of my brain cells dying, and recreating its jokes is usefully very successful, provided you know WHEN NOT TO EXPLAIN THINGS.",

            "content": "This anime reminds me a lot of middle school, as it had very little drama but a ton of dirty mindedness to it.  Heads up, possible spoilers\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe anime is about our main character, Tsuda, attending a former all girls school, and then being forced upon the student council with three very interes..., actually two very interesting characters and one with a height complex.  The story, much like other comedic animes such as Nichijou and Lucky Star, has a bunch of short events in each episode.  SYD didn't transition all these events as well as the other two animes I said andthis caused the anime to have weird pacing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSaved a couple of screen shots of scenery as my wall paper, the art was great!  I believe this is one of the best shounens art-wise, as all the chibi parts were done very well.  If other shounens were drawn/animated like this anime, I may watch more shounen... or not complain about them as much.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.99\\n\r\nOne of my favorite OPs ever, Yamato Nadeshiko Education is extremely catchy.  The ED, Aoi Haru, was a bit of a turn off for a few episodes, but, like what most music does to me, became extremely catchy and I just wanted to hear it all the time.  So in shorter terms, both OP and ED are on my iTunes with roughly 60 plays each.  Yes, I liked them.  The background music wasn't anything special, didn't really look into it as much as other animes.  The voice acting was on point, with two of my favorite seiyuus, Hikasa Yoko and Satou Satomi.  \\n\r\n+1 for those two\\n\r\n-.01 for those two talking dirty like they aren't anything, mostly Satou Satomi, I MEAN SHE PLAYED SUCH INNOCENT CHARACTERS, WHAT HAPPENED.  But than again I liked it... I was gonna give it a -1 but then I was like, Seiyuus are not real life version of their anime character and it actually was funny to hear them talk and blah blah blah... -.01\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nOk, no one cares about the main character, because he is simple and boring and is only there because he is a male.\\n\r\nThe other three... actually, every female in the anime are great characters,  as they all are much like middle school boys (Possibly girls? I don't know how middle school girls acted) with a sense of innocence, but a sense of trying to figure out the world, in dirty ways.  Little character development, just better relationships between the three girls and Tsuda.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nDirty slap stick humor?  How can I not laugh at that?!  I probably would have enjoyed this anime more if I weren't watching it before going to bed and being tired, as I actually didn't laugh as much as I was expecting.  It was great though, just not as funny as I thought it would be.  A lot more just \"what did she say\" and \"uhm... glad my parents don't speak Japanese\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nFunny anime, with a different type of humor, this anime is a must watch in my opinion, but because of the different style of humor, not because it is the best.\\n\r\nWith the next season coming around the corner, I am excited to watch it.  I would like to see more romance though! I mean they set it up and it's confirmed and asdfghjkl.  More romance please.  \\n",

Takatoshi Tsuda gets admitted at Ousai Private Academy, a all girls school until last year, so the number of male students are exceptionally low. He is called in by the Student Council president, Shino Amakusa due to his untidy attire. That moment, Takatoshi realized that the academy is full of eccentric people. He is practically forced in as the vice President of the Student Council on the grounds that they need a male member. There he works with the Perfect President Shino, Airhead Secretary Aria Shichijou, Genius Loli Accountant Suzu Hagimura. Thereare also very good side characters which make the show very interested and quite funny.\\n\r\nSo basically the plot is the generic plot of a dating sim. But letting that expectation down, it is a wildly funny anime, with little to no romance whatsoever. The entire comedy is based upon dirty jokes. The sheer amount of dirty jokes the anime pulls per minute is astounding. But  in spite of the outrageous amount of dirty jokes, the anime itself contains very little ecchi content. So in my opinion, it's a novelty. The jokes are well timed. But don't try to watch the whole series at once because it'll bore you, as nobody likes too much comedy for a long period of time \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite nice for a slice of life anime, and the animation and visuals are decent. This anime has very few lackings and I recommend you people to watch it.",

Plenty of anime do sex jokes, but they usually end up being ecchi with a lot of fan service. This is by no means ecchi anime! This anime is exactly what your typical highschool girl classmates don't want you to hear them talking about. All the perverted sex fantasies and secret desires they have are served to you in this anime on a silver plate, completely without fan service.\r\nSo guy went to a former girls-only high school. No, you didn'tgo there for the harem. You chose that school because it is the closest one to your house. You'd think this will quickly become a harem story, but the main character himself can't get over how all the girls are just casually tossing tampons to each other in the class, simply because they are so used to it (being on a girls-only school in the past years) and are not shy about it in any way.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters may be rather stereotypical, but they are very well executed! You have the rich, perverted airhead bimbo, a perverted miss-perfect highschool student, a tsundere, a spoiled drunk teacher. All the signs of a harem right? But it still doesn't become one! These personalities have a nice mix to them, which keeps the characters fresh and different, from what you are used to in your typical shonen anime.",

What appears at first as another slice of life high school harem / comedy hybrid quickly and subtly begins delivering sexually charged jokes one after the other. The sex centered humor is either going to make or break your opinion of the show, that or if you thought this type of humor was childish to begin with. If you begin to start picking up on the sexual innuendo setups before the punch line hits then you my dirty-dirty friend will probably like the show.\r\nThe entire cast is a sexual riot, well except for our male hero leadTsuda who is caught in the middle of it all, forced to join the student council the moment he stepped on school grounds. Suzu also joins Tsuda in the normal group; though she\u2019s used to taking the brunt of all the short jokes. I always did love the random arrows that showed she\u2019s actually in the scene because of her height, just a part of her pigtails barely visible at the corner of the screen. Shino and Aria round out the rest of the student council members and everything from masturbation, sex toys, and all that jazz do not escape these two. I also can\u2019t forget their sex hungry teacher and student council supervisor Yokoshima who at any moment will jump on the opportunity to hit on any of her male students.\\n\\n\r\nBy no means is the show explicit in its jokes, as it\u2019s all supposed to be taken light-heartedly at the end of the day. The show does not even have any fanservice scenes to speak of, shocking right? I think it\u2019s the fact girls are doing the jokes that help to lighten the mood, if it were the other way around with three guys, this would be viewed as creepy.\\n\\n\r\nJokes aside, there\u2019s generally a tangible story to keep the episodes moving and each character is adequately developed to make sure they aren\u2019t just joke dispensing machines. If you\u2019re not even smiling in the first episode, forget it, this is not for you as the general format of the show and topic of the jokes stay consistent all the way to the end.",

            "content": "You may have seen some very sexual anime, and you may have seen some comedy anime, but very rarely do you find an anime dedicated specifically to sexual humor.  This is where Seitokai Yakuindomo enters the picture.\r\nPros:\r\n-Animation is very good for this type of slice of life/high school type of show, especially when they are parodying other genres of anime.  In one episode they opened up by parodying a type of horror anime, and I legitimately thought I had gotten mixed up and was watching a completely different show altogether.\r\n-While you can definitely see the sex jokes from a mile away, sometimes itdoes catch you off-guard and usually it ends up being really clever.  Even when the humor isn't sexual, there's definitely some very clever 4th wall breakings and genre parodies that seems more akin to the humor of American cartoons than those in Japan.\\n\\n\r\n-Aside from the token Tsundere character, most of these characters break from typical anime tropes (at least the major ones I've heard about) and uses their personality traits to enhance the show's comedy elements.  This isn't a very character driven show, but it doesn't need to be.  The characters are all simple and likable enough that any additional conflict or drama would have weighed down the shows strengths. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n- While this doesn't really affect the overall enjoyment factor too much, every episode seems to have a similar premise to it.  I certainly didn't go into this expecting anything plot heavy, but a little less redundancy would've been nice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nVery funny, definitely a must see if you like school/comedy anime.  If sexual humor makes you cringe (or turns you off) then avoid this show like the plague.  As for me, I really enjoyed this series as immature and simple as it was.  Check it out if you want some light, entertaining, fluff that will get a chuckle out of you now and then.",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo is one of the more unique anime comedies I've ever seen and while it isn't a great anime per se, it is certainly an enjoyable one. \r\nThe story revolves around Takatoshi Tsuda's daily life with his fellow Ousai Student Council members. The plot itself isn't very exquisite and I'd even go so far to say is the weakest part of the series, but what makes it interesting is the personalities of the President, Shino Amakura and the Secretary, Aria Shichijou who have a habit of constantly making sexual references to just about anything that is brought up in conversation. Even the Treasurer SuzuHagimura had her own personality quirks since she fits a loli archetype with the maturity of an adult...unless someone mentions her height. Tsuda in the Student Council was the only main character and seemed to be the only voice of reason. In regards to the story, my biggest complaint about it is it really didn't go anywhere. It even got to the point where it felt like the story was getting repetitive. If you're looking for any sort of romance or dynamic character building, there really isn't a whole lot. It stays pretty consistent from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite my beefs with the story, I will admit one thing...the scriptwriting was fantastic. One of the funniest scripts I have ever seen in an anime and the seiyuu's did a very nice job of performing their roles. A minor complaint I do have about it is I wish they would've actually toned it down slightly with the sexual commentary and innuendo. There were times it seemed like they were repeating jokes and it just wasn't that effective the second and third times around. Still, this series didn't cease to amaze me with how bold it would get with its script.\\n\\n\r\nI found the characters to be pretty funny and interesting. While I already mentioned the main characters, the supporting staff in their own right had their moments. Hata, Mitsuba, and Kotomi were three funny supporting characters to go with an already hilarious main cast.\\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't necessarily anything great about the animation or the music. None of it was that memorable but that is typically how goes with anime comedies. The one thing I can say was the OP was rather catchy and fit the mood of the series perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a rather touchy series in regards to enjoyment. If you love sexual jokes and humor, you'll love this series. I found them to be hit-or-miss, but I can say they hit more than they missed. It is a pretty strong comedy series as far as the writing is concerned. Like I mentioned, I just wish it would've done a little more with its story or at the very least, have a little more character building between Tsuda and his Student Council classmates. I think that's what separates a series like Seitokai no Ichizon or Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou from a series like this. Those animes are at least willing to try character building and story progression. Still, you can't go wrong with a series like this. It is refreshingly unique series for it's ambitious scriptwriting and if you're looking for a series that isn't too deep with lots of sexual humor, this is a must see.\\n",

            "content": "\"A-a-are you full already!?\"\r\nI had low expectations of this show. I don't know why, but I just did. It may have been the fact that these days, most animes involve this Slice-of-Life thing involving high school students. I've seen a lot of them, however, none were quite like this... how should I put it... Seitokai Yakuindomo, to my surprise, was actually one of the most entertaining animes I've ever seen. It's full of comedy that literally makes me laugh out loud. The unique part about it is that all of the humor is related to sex in some way, and it still comes out professional,mature, and hilarious above all. So let's get down to business, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo is about a guy who gets into what was formally an all-girls school. The school started allowing guys in, however, most of the students are still girls. It's every guy's dream to be in a school similar to this one, but once you get inside, it's a completely different story. This guy, Tsuda, is one of the guys who gets into this school. On the first day, he meets Shino, Suzu, and Aria, otherwise known as the Student Council. As most of us know, student council members are supposed to be mature and smart. They got the last part right, but these girls are what make the show for mature audiences only. Constant sexual references about intercourse, jerking off, feminine hygiene products... and every single reference makes me refuse to stop laughing. Tsuda gets put on the Student Council, and that's where the story begins... if you can actually call it a story. It's similar to Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star. There isn't really a story revolved around the show, it's just random fun every episode. It's good to take a break from the big storylines every once in a while, but I would have liked to see at least some plot take place at one point in the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched the anime, I was apparently watching the censored version. How could I tell, you may ask? Pixels over pictures, beeps over voices, pretty much what you'd find in a normal sitcom these days. It was good for quite a few laughs, and saving me the expense of looking at what a vibrator looks like. Thank God for that. The artwork was good overall. I liked the character designs, especially Suzu's, her amazingly small figure makes it funny to watch her yell at everyone for calling her a kid when she is in fact 16.\\n\\n\r\nReally good voice acting. I liked the voice actors and actresses that took part in making this anime possible, and I thank them for that. They handled their roles really well, and the humor they put out for the show was awesome. Pure genius!\\n\\n\r\nPoor Tsuda. He's probably the most mature one in the entire ensemble, due to the fact he's able to keep a straight face and not freak out most of the time when a sex reference is brought up. It's those calm characters that can handle situations like that that make me love shows like this. It's also kind of interesting how instead of the guys making all those references, it's the women. You'd expect guys to do that, and girls would be too innocent to say anything like that, but it's all switched in this. Shino seems to take everything the wrong way, but she also brings the humor to the anime. Suzu is what turns people into Loli-Lovers. 16 years old with an IQ of 180, and yet, she's only 4'6\". That's amazingly short. But she was my personal favorite character in the entire show, and I liked how the \"Suzu's Head\" arrow would start flailing around when the camera would go over her head. Aria... beautiful, rich, erotic dreamer... 2 of the 3 seem normal for one of the protagonists. That's right, I was referring to beautiful and erotic dreamer (not really). Her imagination takes thing to a whole new level in the anime universe, and it makes you wonder what these people were like as kids. I'd guess that they were pretty much the exact same, but I can't really picture a 6 year old reading a XXX magazine.\\n\\n\r\nConstant laughs and enjoyment. I haven't ever seen an anime quite like this, it was totally worth watching if you're looking for something in the Comedy dept., so I would recommend this to anyone that loves to laugh. Those who get uncomfortable with any mention of sex, steer clear. Just don't watch it. You'll be more uncomfortable then you've ever been in your life. But those who don't mind for it, I challenge you to watch it.",

If you want to really get a good laugh, please do not hesitate to watch this anime as it is really funny.\r\nStory:NIL\r\n  This anime has absolute no plot at all. Maybe just a some events linking to the later episodes but I am absolute that even if you watch the episode half-way, it wouldn't affect anything. However, a anime without any plot to be this good is not something really common.\r\nArt:6/10\r\n  I admit that I immediately left this anime the first time i watched it after about 5 minutes because theart isn't really very desirable. It kind of gives me a feeling of lethargy. When i first started that anime, I was already quite tired. Additionally, since it was my first time watching this anime the art instantly made me even more tired and I left this anime after 5 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7/10\\n\r\n  Probably one of the main aspect that makes the anime really hilarious. Think of those sounds that would probably tickle you a bit. That's the sound you get when you watch this anime which contributes to the light-hearted anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8/10\\n\r\n  The characters are seriously, insanely funny. No joke. I dare say everyone in this anime has a really funny role to play. I really mean every character. Be it the main or the subs, they all had a role to really tickle me when I watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8/10\\n\r\n  I really enjoy this anime because it can seriously and instantly brighten up anyone's moody day. With just one episode, I was instantly back to my normal self despite feeling a little depressed earlier. The jokes are funny to a certain extent. Warning: Most of the jokes are practically all dirty. You get what I mean. Dirty. I even went to the point when I google some stuffs to get what the joke is about and learnt some new vocabulary. Watch at your own risk, especially if your parents are really strict about things like that.\\n\\n\r\n  If you are feeling a little moody today, you can check out this anime because I think the jokes inside can cheer you up at least by a little.

            "content": "\"Now that I think about it, we're both under one umbrella.\"\r\n\"No shit.\"\r\nOkay, before I start this I just wanted to let you know that I haven't watched every episode quite yet. I'm only half way through, half way meaning five more episodes left. Up above was a quote I found extremely funny for some reason.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nA new format for reviewing? What is this? I'm now going to do reviews like this. I see other people do it like this, and I'm gonna... erhmm... steal it. The story follows a teenage boy named Tsuda who transferred to an all-girls school. Only because it was close, though.No real reason. He is immediately confronted by the student council president, and forcibly made a male representative of the student council, and also a vice-president. Eh, don't know, but don't judge it. I think that's all there really is, other than that, a lot of humor is in it. Whilst walking home in the rain, the above quote was said by the student council leader, Shino. The group constantly makes jokes about sex, but only the girls. The three girls, Shino, Aria and Hagimura... well, not so much Hagimura, but the other two girls are constantly making jokes about sex. I think Shion is a curious virgin.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation constantly changes between scenes. Like, it will go into chibi mode or something like that. I don't know if that's what you would necessarily call it, but, yeah, kinda like that. But, other than that it's completely normal animation. Changes from style to style from time to time, but most anime do that anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI actually quite enjoy the music and whatnot in Seitokai Yakuindomo. I have 'Seitokai Yakuindomo' on my clipboard, so I can just paste it whenever I want with Ctrl+V. But, the music is pretty much how I rate every other anime, because I think the music is one of the most important things of an anime, including animation, including story, including character... So everything in anime is pretty much important, so... Forget all my words!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI pretty much love all the characters in the anime. They're all pretty epic, and they're all pretty funny. Tsuda is the main guy, literally, I think he's one of the only 5 guys in the anime. Tsuda is probably the most responsible out of all of them, Aria and Shino constantly making sex jokes, actually. No, Hagimura is the most responsible and the smartest. So, forget my words once again. Now, time to explain more in-depth. Lemme redo this.\\n\\n\r\nTakatoshi Tsuda is the main character of the story. He moves to a new town or whatnot, and goes to an all-girls school except for a couple of guys only because it is close to his house. Seriously, who wants to walk 80000000m just to go to school? Nobody would actually really walk that far in real life. Not to mention, the male representative and the vice-president of the student council.\\n\\n\r\nShino Amakusa is the president of the student council, and I think she is a curious virgin. She constantly makes jokes about sex, and Aria goes along with them like nothing is wrong. She once got Tsuda a pornographic novel to read, considering she never got a gift for the opposite sex. That's just something funny I'm pointing out.\\n\\n\r\nAria Shichijo is the secretary of the student council and is good friends with Shino. She has an extremely perverted mind, and converts almost anything she says into something sexual. Pretty much Shino for ya, and it's also Aria. They're basically... twins from different families.\\n\\n\r\nSuzu Hagimura is the student council treasurer and in the same year as Tsuda. Probably the smartest out of all of them, considering she claims that her IQ is 180, can do 10-digit calculations in her head, is fluent in multiple languages including English... but she is no taller than an elementary school student. Once called a 'little kid' or 'child' she often gets mad and... gets mad? I don't know. I've spent too much time on this section. Not really, because it's near the end of the review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI've enjoyed this anime so far, considering I'm really a fan of humorous anime, and other... stuff. It wouldn't be my favorite category though, because as you should know, I watch a lot of psychological/horror anime. I just like seeing people getting massacred (don't know if spelled right) and people getting a steak to their heart (Shiki). But, comedy is nice for a change. So, this is probably an accurate scoring, or not, but if this didn't help you, this was only to review in my eyes but if you found it helpful, thank you, if not *cries for sixteen years*.\\n\\n\r\n~ D.M\\n",

It's just humour.\r\nIt doesn't really have a plot. It's random and straight-up comedy. There's no character development, the art ism't special, sound is sound, but I enjoyed all of it. You may not even laugh at every thing, however, you may get around 1 or 2 really good laughs per episode. The use of sexual innuendos in this anime truly breaks the boundaries of every other anime that has attempted to do so. There is censoring butnot so much as to where you miss what they're trying to say. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you're looking for an anime you just want to enjoy... Watch this. This is for you!",

To put it simply, it was just several hours of smutty jokes; and not even good ones.  It was puerile, weak and childish.  \r\nWhen you're eight years old, someone saying \"boobies\" is hilarious.  Even as an adult, you still might snigger.  Sitting through 13 episodes of an anime with humour at that level, however... that takes a special kind of person.  The story was non-existent, the jokes were obvious and desperate... it has no redeeming features.  \r\nIlove a bit of smut and innuendo, I genuinely do.  I'm not one of those deluded buffoons who thinks a dirty joke is beneath them.  Quite the opposite, actually.

            "content": "I had high expectations for this anime ever since I watched the Suzu speaking English video which by the way was really funny.\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo was ruined by excessive sex jokes that became totally redundant after episode 2-3 but I stuck with the show as I was a little bit hopeful that I might see more like the Suzu video in terms of humour but no.\r\nIt was funny at first but after that only the occassional laughs were left here and there just by the reactions of characters. You know the anime lost its charm whenever the laughs are from the rarely funny reactions instead ofthe actual jokes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were basically copy and paste for those who made sex jokes as that was somewhat their main focus: to make sex jokes every single scene. And the show is basically made up of these sex-crazed characters except for Suzu and Tsuda who are the best characters (if at all) because they don't just think of something dirty to say all the time.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a slice of life show (a crappy one on that front too) there really isn't much of a story here. For these kind of shows its the characters that are the stories themselves; how they evolve throughout the anime and how they interact after a while of knowing each other. There was none of that here, you could literally watch the anime back to front and it really wouldn't make much of a difference. No one became memorable enough that I could remember their names, hence the lack of names in this review.\\n\\n\r\nThis really would have been a 4 if not for the likeable art style and great soundtrack. I managed to put up with this show because of these factors and as I mentioned before, the occasional laughs. It was almost a pain to watch this show so I won't be watching the sequels.\\n\\n\r\nOf course this is just my opinion and I am into sex jokes, done right, considering Gintama is my favourite anime. In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone who hates excessive jokes of the same type and poor character development.",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo is definitely not a fever dream! It exists! I swear to god I dreamed this shit up one day in middle school, but now that I've re watched the first season I can definitely confirm it is real and it's...alright. \r\nAt the risk of seeming like a basic boy in while writing this review I'm gonna go ahead and chop this baby up into sections. Starting with art and animation: It's, alright. The show was clearly doing one of two things when it came to it's art direction. They were either a small team with a low budget or they paid a lotof money to make it look kinda below average. The show generally stays at a very generic mid 2000s art style. It's serviceable but bland. However, that's not to say they don't spend more than half the show in either a chibi art style or some other variant that I don't know the name of. There are glimpses of really interesting animation with the viewer following the camera as it goes around different locations. That was however, the exception not the rule. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the story, there kinda isn't one. It's a mostly episodic comedy with light story progression. You won't need to watch one episode to understand another, but I do recommend watching it in order. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is easier to sum up. Ninety percent of the sound: songs, sound effects, etc. all sounds well below average. The other ten percent sounds law suit levels of similar to Pokemon. Next!\\n\\n\r\nHere's where we get into why this show is ultimately a recommendation. The characters and the comedy. I'm not going to spoil any jokes, but this is basically the kind of show that middle school boys have wet dreams about. It's a parody of harem ecchi anime that for the most part accomplishes the goal of satirizing the genre, but unfortunately does a habit in reveling in the same tropes it's trying to mock. The jokes, the jokes are good and although they are very low brow, they still have proper structure and can be hilarious. The characters themselves are a joy to follow. My favorite actually being a side character, that now that I think about it is usually around when a lot of the cool animation tricks and set pieces come into play. The show is worth watching for her alone if I'm being honest. The main cast is incredibly strong with a lot of chemistry between the four members. Unfortunately the comedy is mostly confined to a couple of jokes. All of them just being talking in a group in front of the camera. Realizing that can make the show a bit more dull. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment? Honestly this is the only thing that really matters. You see I watched this show blazed out of my mind and it was fucking hilarious. If it wasn't for the sub par art and animation, and some of the sound honestly sounding like Pokemon and the rest being kinda meh, I would have loved this show and put it in my favorites. I really do like this show. It's lowbrow humor is extremely well executed and it's not hard to get attached the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I don't reccomend watching this sober so if you're not in a legal state, and you're of age, some liqour can do you good too. \\n\\n\r\nThis is StoinkyDoinkers telling you to watch Seitokai Yakuindomo and stay in school.",

And that is it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are huge number of sex related jokes. I wouldn't call them dirty just smutty. It is generally the kind of thing you find funny or you don't. Most of the dialogue is there to build up to a sex related joke where there is a deliberate misunderstanding or it is just shameless.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately the jokes are delivered by some good characters with some decent voice acting many of which are standard anime fair, the almost tsundere school president, rich girl with large breasts, short but intelligent girl obsessed by her height, irresponsible teacher, emotionally stunted president of the newspaper club who is more paparazzi than journalist and hyperactive younger sister and of course Tsuda who is the straight man. Also a little romance for Tsuda with the president of the judo club. All of whom deliver sex  related jokes.\\n\\n\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo is not a deep and meaningful anime.

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo\r\nThis one is a little hard to wrap my mind around. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I was laughing like a damn maniac every episode because the things they say, or the puns they make, or the irony of the situation is just too hilarious. This anime really did make me laugh like no other one has. The only problem really is their way of doing so: sex jokes. That\u2019s right, of every element known to man that has any comedic value sex jokes was the way they decided to go. And you know what? It was not even half bad. I'd recommend itto anyone who wants to have a good laugh. But be warned: it may be a little uncomfortable if you can't handle it. Nonetheless, its a great show. Just fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThe story is very simple: boy goes to school, gets stopped by student official, is forced into joining their club, and then becomes very good friends with all the new people of the club. So essentially, he goes to school, is tagged for wearing his uniform in a sloppy manner, and then is forced into the club (in this case, the student council). Except you get much more than you thought you would. Of the three girls, Shino Amakuza is the perverted but exceptionally smart president. Aria Shichijou is the beautiful, rich ditzy girl who spaces out almost all the time, but she IS second best at school behind the president. Suzu Hagimura is super smart, the genius of the school, but is barely standing at 4 feet tall. Maybe even less. You can\u2019t help but love the blend of characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThis was probably the biggest flaw, as it was a big factor in why this series didn\u2019t get a higher score. The animation was good. But that\u2019s all. It was good. There where some parts where if you freeze frame, you see a grotesque image of facial features (nose, mouth, eyes) too far to the left, or too close together, or too far down. But when they move, it all goes back. So all in all, the animation is not bad. But I definitely think that the producers could\u2019ve put more thought into it. \\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\r\nAhh. The entrance was just great. Even from the first episode, the intro was very fun and childish and it just wasn\u2019t as serious as the intro\u2019s of most of the anime that I\u2019ve been watching. So it was a nostalgic feeling I got from hearing the intro. And at just over a minute long, its worth it. I recommend you watch it at least once. But I gotta tell you, I watched it every chance I could.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nThis is probably the best part. The characters are wayyyyy wacky, and I just couldn\u2019t get over it. The inner machination of their minds is a complete mystery. You can\u2019t say you like the rain, because then one says that it nicely camouflages the sound of masturbating. You can\u2019t say you like it either, because then the other would say that you can\u2019t safely masturbate because the rain makes it hard to hear who is approaching you. Odd? Yes. And the poor guy just cant win. What\u2019s good is that they\u2019re in groups. You\u2019ve got the President and Shichijou being the perverted weirdos, and you\u2019ve got Tsuda and Hagimura who are always combating what they say and attempting to keep the norm.  They honestly all made even the perverted uncomfortable stuff watchful. I can\u2019t tell you how hard these characters made me laugh. Schichijou is so damn adorable, because she\u2019s rich, and thus, clueless. Not to say all people are clueless, but when you\u2019re spacing out on the stairs for a few good minutes, then come to the realization that the school doesn\u2019t have escalators like you\u2019re accustomed to \u2013 yeah, that persons pretty much an idiot. The first time I saw her space out I was laughing hysterically and had to re-watch it about 5 times. I\u2019m not a big fan of anything over ecchi unless I\u2019m prepared for it or unless it is relevant to the story. In this case, it was relevant to the personality of the characters. They made it truly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI can\u2019t tell you just how much I enjoyed this show. This show is seriously the first time I started laughing like a damn maniac. I felt like such an idiot, but I couldn\u2019t stop. It was definitely one of the best shows I\u2019ve seen in a long time. I honestly loved it. This is seriously recommended to someone who is MATURE. Not an age rank, but someone who can handle the amount of perverseness in here. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with vibes or sexual innuendos, then turn away. It\u2019s funny, but you need to be mature enough to get the jokes and know what\u2019s meant to be funny and what isn\u2019t.  \\n\\n\r\nFlaws:\\n\r\nThe only flaw is the main plot for mostly everything: ecchi. Every episode has a perverted character in it. I\u2019m not a huge fan of pervertedness, and so I didn\u2019t really like the premise for the jokes, but it wasn\u2019t all that bad. All in all, it\u2019s a great show, recommended for anyone who wants to have a good laugh.\\n",

            "content": "Hilarious, perverted, and plotless, Seitokai Yakuindomo (SYD) outclasses most of comedies in the anime scene. Having no overarching plot, this show does not have to follow the conventional methods of character development. This show also has witty and clever play with words, which always end up with great perversion.\r\nStory - 5: Having no plot, SYD is very unpredictable; the audience won't know what would happen in the next episode (if you don't watch the preview that is). However, in my personal opinion, this adds to the excitement of watching it. Some shows I have watched (with an overarching plot) are so predictable and cliched, thatI just end up skipping to the last few episode and not bother with the episodes in between.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7: SYD does not have the most detailed characters or the best drawings, however the simplicity adds to the humour, especially during the shows 'punch-line' scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10: The characters in this show is the absolute best. The main four characters are Takatoshi Tsuda, Shino Amakusa, Suzu Hagimura, and Aria Shichijou, Shino being my personal favourite. This show uses humour common to the anime scene. By contrasting the perverted characters (Shino Amakusa and Aria Shichijou) with the 'straight' characters (Takatoshi Tsuda and Suzu Hagimura) this show is able to convey humour that is unique in anime. The characters in this show always have witty (possibly dirty) comments up their sleeve. Sometimes I even expect one after every dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10: Overall, SYD is a very enjoyable show. This show doesn't require a brain to watch, all you need is a strong diaphragm and a dirty mind.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9: When this show and its sequel was still airing, I was eagerly waiting for it every week; downloading it as soon as I see it online. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like this show I also recommend:\\n\r\nMangaka-san to Assistant-san to\\n\r\nHentai Ouji Warawanai Neko [HenNeko]",

He's about to start his first year at Ousai Academy which had just turned co-ed. Tsuda is now the only male in this school and is suddenly approached by Amakusha Shino, student council president, and is now appointed vice student council president. \r\nStory\r\nWhat story? It's just sexual joke after sexual joke. I did somewhat find this funny until episode 6 where it just kept getting redundant. They're pretty much doing the same thing over and over again by just usingthe same type of jokes which most of the time aren't even that funny.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nIt's decent for an anime like this and there's really nothing special.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThere's no OST to really talk about so I'll just talk about the OP and END. The OP is pretty much just showing you how this anime would be like. Sexual jokes everywhere. The OP wasn't really catchy so I didn't really care for it. It did suit this anime though. The END doesn't suit the anime. It's really easy to skip over the OP and END because they're not really memorable and they don't really sound good. This is my personal preference here though.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nTsuda Takatoshi- Our main character who is really boring and is just a straight man\\n\\n\r\nHagimura Suzu- The really short girl who is really smart.

Jokes get to redundant and the only thing this anime has, is just sexual perverted jokes and that's all. \\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIf you have a dirty mind and like dirty jokes, then you'll like this show. Otherwise, I'd advise you to just stay away from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: 2.8/10",

This show makes me laugh, despite all the sexual innuendos in this program. I keep forgetting that these characters are kids in high school, so it does make it hard to take this show seriously.\r\nStill, if your a fan of this type of show, then I think you will like it. It's probably the goofiest show that I have seen so far.\r\nFavorite characters would have to be Hagimura and Shino. For somereason, they remind me of most girls that I would always go to school with. Only difference is Shino is more diligent when it comes to studying actual work than just man's work, if you catch my meaning. Hagimura was just a delight because it goes back and forth with how much you can fun of the short girls sterotype, and i really enjoyed her presence. I know my review is probably late considering that this show was just on air seven years ago. \\n\\n\r\nOh but I also can't forget about Ranko Hata. That girl knows how to go all the way personal when it comes to photographing students and teachers, and it made me laugh so hard because it did remind me of how the newspaper club used to be back in my school.",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo, I don't really know what I expected, but I was still disappointed. At the time of writing this review, this is the only anime I've ever dropped, and I will try to explain why.\r\nLet's start off with the story, which is not there, there is no story. It's the most generic high-school scenery someone can come up with, and nothing happened in the 8 episodes I watched. It is the same, every episode could be the first one, and there is no development at all.\r\nSpeaking about development, the characters are the most shallow ones I've seen so far. Now I see what thepoint of this anime was, the 'plot' wasn't supposed to be interesting, it's more about 'comedy' if anything. Comedy which didn't work on me. \\n\\n\r\nNow I wouldn't call myself a snob, but this anime was below my level. I can enjoy comedy, and even ecchi, although I'm not a fan of it, can be bearable if there's some reason for it. This however was not really apparent at all in this anime. I was constantly wondering whether or not I was supposed to laugh at the same sexual innuendo's that get thrown around all the time. It's as if the writing happened by a twelve-year-old who just discovered what 'sex' is. Maybe it get's better in later seasons, I didn't have the patience to find out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are alright, though not really good at all, maybe I couldn't enjoy it because I was already somewhat pissed off, who knows.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, even though I wouldn't call this anime good in any way, I can see it having some sort of appeal to a very specific group of people. A group of people I'm not part of. I'm sure there are worse shows out there, this simply has been my first encounter with an anime I think is dreadful. Whether or not you should watch this is something you can decide for yourself. If you enjoy the same iteration of sexual jokes, you might find this somewhat entertaining, for anything else, you're in the wrong place.",

            "content": "Eh, a special review for this special anime.\r\nFirstly, I would like to say that this review is not for every1, not because there are extremely graphic scenes, but rather cos many of the jokes inside require certain \"special knowledge\". I had some problems understanding certain jokes too, but I certainly enjoyed it, cos of the execution of the script and certain background sounds during the scenes.\r\nStory: \r\nThis is basically a gag series, specialising in sexual and sarcastic jokes. The sarcastic jokes are mainly targeted at Suzu though. Other than that are feelings of harmony between the Seitokai members and some undertones of love.\r\nI remembered thatthe first ep was a little hard to take as the presentation style was rather unique, compared to other 4-koma adaptations I've seen. But from ep 2, somehow the 'intervals' didn't bother me much anymore. But till the end of the show I still dun get the purpose of many of the 'intervals' inserted between scenes within an episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yeah, most of the content inside are sexual parodies or puns, so if you're not into that kind of thing this series might be offensive or alien to you. Whatever it is, it's best to take some scenes with a pinch of salt, and pls dun flame this show if you dun like it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nAverage. There weren't much scenes to flaunt animation skills since most of the scenes were rather dialogue-based.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVoice acting was quite good, esp for Tsuda and Shino. Background music was quite good too, and OP and ED was good, but I prefer OP.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacters were ok, not too unique. Suzu in particular reminds me of the small girl in Working!, and Tsuda the straight guy, similar to Takanashi in Working!.\\n\r\nShino reminds me of Medaka in Medaka Box, but to a less extreme extent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was present, though in small doses each time. For example, we could see feelings being developed, and greater harmony between the SYD members. Also, some personalities were developed in certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\nWell it's good and reminds me a lot of B Gata H Kei. Ecchi-comedy at its best in sexual puns, for this series. Other stuff in this series is also not bad, like the stalker photographer etc.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9\\n\r\nIMO, the best anime in summer 2010 season. Need I say more? :D\\n\\n\\n\\n",

That aside;\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo a school comedy that revolves around a student council and the absurd and sometimes bizarre sex jokes. The story isn't anything spectacular, and there is no plot development. There are no story twists or unexpected turns. Like I said, the main focus in this anime is the outrageous and random perverted jokes thrown at you without a minute passing in between. I wasn't satisfied with the ending because of the lack of a relationship to form between anyof the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very well done, especially the lighting. It was definitely enough to keep me interested in the show, not that the constant barrage of jokes wasn't enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also very well done. The opening and ending, while not among my favorites, were very upbeat and fun. The voice acting wasn't half bad either, especially when they say the most obscene things in cute voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is mostly you're typical group of characters, not really anything special. Except the main character, Tsuda, isn't the common, useless male lead with his mind in the gutter. While he has his moments, he is actually a pretty normal guy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though mostly romance/comedies are my cup of tea, I actually really enjoyed this anime. I can't even begin to count how many times I laughed out loud at the bizarre comments made while the characters are drawn cutely while holding a thumbs-up. I don't think that the creators were trying to go anywhere past making you're jaw drop or stomach cramp from the absurd jokes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBeing the first review for me to write, but most certainly not the first anime to watch, I'm not really sure what else to say. Overall, this is a good choice if you want to watch an anime with no plot and pure humor. I sure had some good laughs, and would recommend this to anyone looking for a funny anime. However, I don't recommend watching this late at night, because you're sure to wake the whole house with the sound of you falling out of your chair from laughter.",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo runs on a very simple formula; Protagonist Tsuda enters an almost entirely all-girls environment and is always (verbally) sexually harassed by the female schoolmates around him. The unique thing about the show is how the girls are the ones making the perverted jokes, giving you a very different feel of the girls act compared to other series (or perhaps closer to RL). Every other males in the series is almost non-existent (I forgot if I ever seen one) so there's a hint of harem, but it's not like that mattered for the show anyway.\r\nThere's a brief sequence in the beginning showing how Tsudagot into the situation he landed himself in, but don't go thinking that the show actually have any real story; Any form of plot goes as far as the first episode and the rest of the show is a series of perverted tsukkomi-boke routine, with Tsuda delivering the witty comeback to every joke.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality was mediocre. I didn't expect much from a show like this though. It did get the job done, but there was nothing impressive about it. I do like the OP and ED though, they've injected a more energetic feel into this otherwise fairly stale anime.\\n\\n\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo is fairly enjoyable if you'd like to just let your mind go blank for a bit and simply enjoy a slightly different kind of comedy. Not exactly what you'd call a \"quality\" show, but a fairly decent one nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Concept: Kinda interesting...\\n\r\nStory Style: Good\\n\r\nAudio/Visual: Fairly good\\n\r\nValue: 7",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo is a fresh new comedy of the summer season and personally, one of my favorite comedies.\r\nStory- The synopsis pretty much covers it. Basically, a male (Tsuda), one of the very few, who attends a female-dominated school and is randomly chosen to be the male representative of the student council. From then on, everyday school life for him, which he once thought was to be normal, has now become strange. Since it's a school anime, there's really no story at all.\r\nArt & Sound- This is one of the first anime that I've seen produced by GoHands and to be honest, they did quite agood job. The character designs are particularly slim and stand out quite well. Nothing notably wrong with sound. The OPs and EDs are upbeat and I found nothing wrong with the VAs, so no problems there at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- What I find great about this anime is the characters. The female leads (Shino, Aria, Suzu) are pretty \"unique\". By \"unique\", I mean that although you can tell how their character is on the outside (especially Suzu), what makes them stand out is how they are on the inside. The supporting cast if notably great as well. I was a bit disappointed, though, that they don't appear as much as some supporting characters do in comedies. If you're looking for character development, expect to be disappointed because there's no drastic development with the characters whatsoever. Maybe just a little bit, but it's nothing that changes the show in a different way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- What I liked about Seitokai was the random humor thrown at me every episode. The main humor point in Seitokai was its perverted thoughts, but with a twist, it's the females doing that instead of the male lead. The opening, in particular, did that well and was something I've honestly never seen before. Seitokai, however was not the first anime I've seen where female characters are the ones who are perverted. While B Gata H Kei DID have female characters think perverted thoughts, most of it was pretty much forced and I couldn't find it funny at all. Seitokai, however, has it set up fairly random and unexpected, therefore, making it funny. Although, if you've grown accustomed to the comedy, for example, you can expect a sex joke when it's coming, so you may either laugh or not. Overall, it's best to watch Seitokai at a steady pace.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Seitokai is not the best comedy out there, it is certainly one that stood out to me so far this year. It may not be the comedy for everyone due to its perversion, but give it an episode or two and find out if you'll like it. Most certainly, it'll surprise you like it did to me.",

            "content": "\"Sex-Jokes\" the anime! Seitokai Yakuindomo in a nutshell.\r\nIf you're looking for a hysterical, perverted, pure for-laughs-only anime, you've found it. If you're looking for a lot of fan-service, heavy romance, or ecchi, look somewhere else, as this show avoids visual adult humor. Your view of sexual humor will utterly influence your enjoyment of this show. If you appreciate it, it's fantastic. If not, it's terrible.\r\nUnusual in that most all of the jokes come directly and intentionally from the female cast, who represent a different fetish each, the show is surprisingly enjoyable. Despite the immature content, it doesn't really come off as low-brow; most of thehumor comes from wordplay and misunderstandings. Yet if you really just can't stand inappropriate innuendos or any no-filter dick jokes, then you might give this one a pass. Otherwise it's a great interlude between your more serious dramas and it's really easy to drop and pick up at your leisure.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much of a story to push the characters along, being very much slice-of-life. It often changes scenes pretty quickly, to move onto the next joke or pun. This left me a little bored in the few scenes when there wasn't a joke, but that was between laughing my ass off from great writing, so it's not much of a downside. Unfortunately sometimes there is a bit lost in translation to English, but the sub does a decent job to explain anything that would be otherwise lost. Well enough that despite the lost timing of the joke, you still can chuckle a little.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is a great laugh and I recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of humor, but don't expect a compelling story or anything serious.",

            "content": "When I started watching this anime, I was expecting some kind of romantic comedy/school anime; little did I know, I was in for a surprise!\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo revolves around Takatoshi Tsuda, who joins a new school that used to be all-girls, and is coerced into the student council (who is *SURPRISE* all-girls). If you smell a hint of harem and sexual innuendos, you're half right! This anime is the epitome of sex jokes and references. It's a comedy anime, with the set up as aforementioned, but revolves almost entirely around sexual jokes and word play. It will actually take you by surprise how much sexual jokesand references they can make. Many are clever or completely unexpected, and being that Tsuda is really the only male character (and he's the only NORMAL character), it's the GIRLS that are making these weird jokes. I don't even know how I would react if a female friend casually said some of the stuff to me that was said to Tsuda in this anime!\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, I actually found it rather funny; although, I also found the barrage of constant sexual jokes also a bit tiring. If you're at an age where sex is a new/primary interest of yours, then you will find this anime especially funny and entertaining; that's probably why I didn't appreciate the comedy as much as other's did (I sound old, but I'm only 19). I still enjoyed the anime though, as it was something I had never seen before and the jokes were still moderately comedic and clever.\\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't much in ways of story, the anime is mostly just meant to make you laugh. Each episode is sporadic and deals with completely different things than the previous one. All the anime needs is the set up from the first episode, and then things take off from there. Just Like clothes. (Just kidding. Whoops, now I'm making unnecessary sexual jokes too. Seitokai Yakuindomo got to me)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty average for an anime. It's of a standard that I like, but there wasn't anything that would set it apart as spectacular. It was good, but not great. But I kind of feel like that was the point; the characters weren't really meant to stand out visually, but their personalities were, and OH BOY DID THEIR PERSONALITIES STAND OUT.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what really set the anime off. Tsuda is the most 'normal' character, and the one we can relate too. Basically everyone else is over-sexual, short of Suzu Hagimura (emphasis on SHORT). The way they act and react to each other is what really makes the anime funny. Shino Amakusa, the President of the Student Council, and Aria Schichijo, the Secretary, are the ones who make the most ridiculous and clever sexual jokes. There are also some less sexual secondary characters, like Mitsuba Mutsumi or Kaede Igarashi, and they are enjoyable in their own right. My personal favorite character was Ranko Hata; something about her monotone way of speaking, but extreme personality, was just absolutely hilarious and entertaining for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, you'd watch this anime for a good laugh, especially if you find sexual references funny. But this anime is the bane of your existence if you hate perverted references. Overall, it was an enjoyable short anime, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a purely comedic anime.",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo. Not for the hardcore anime viewers that write 10 page long essays on a single misplayed note of an OST which had a sound wave 1 Hz shorter than it should have been. \r\nBe wary; this is my first and probably only review ever (\u5618).\r\nAs you can see from my overall score of this anime, I have thoroughly enjoyed this show. The sex jokes, the innuendos, the characters, the 'ecchi' scenes. Loved every second of it. Hell, I've even watched the whole series multiple times and still laugh at the jokes (immaturity at its finest).\r\nRight, lets lay this out like a proper review.\r\nStory:6\\n\r\nI have given it a 6 for story, although it probably only deserves a 4 at best. There is little to no 'real' story to this. Every episode is just crammed full of perverted scenes. To be honest, it's actually quite difficult to keep track of the chronological order of things (ending of Seitokai Yakuindomo*). Although there is no actual story, it was fun watching the day to day life of Tsuda as he goes through school trying to take as little notice as possible of the immature minds of his senpai in the School Council.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nHonestly, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to rate artwork and animation. The art of this show does not displease me, however it isn't exactly Fate/Zero or Steins;Gate or even Monogatari level artwork. I guess my overall score for it would be 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nAgain, first time review, not sure what to talk about here. Didn't really notice any blank spaces of sound during the show and the light happy-go-lucky background music was delightful to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nI guess I should also add in Character voice actors/actresses into this section. \\n\\n\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo, in my personal opinion, has perfect seiyuu for each character. \\n\\n\r\nYoko Hikasa (Rias Gremory, Mio Akiyama seiyu) voices the part of the school council president, Shino Amakusa, perfectly. The slightly controlling tone of a club president matches Shino's voice brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nSatomi Sato (Ritsu Tainaka, Wendy Marvell seiyu) voices the part of the airhead ojousama, Aria Shichijou. The slight 'airiness' (I guess) of her voice fits the personality of the beloved school council secretary.\\n\\n\r\nSayuri Yahagi (many supporting characters seiyu...) voices the returning student with 180 IQ able to speak perfectly in English and do 10 digit sums in her head... but she doesn't have a body anywhere near that of a 16 year old. Suzu Hagimura. To be fair, her voice as Suzu is either love or hate. I for one, think that it is befitting of the character. Some may disagree and say that it is too high pitched.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI have covered some of the qualities of the 3 main female students in the 'Sound' section. \\n\\n\r\nShino Amakusa, the school council president is the perfect female. Good manners, good at sports, best grades of her year. However, her mind isn't fully out of puberty yet. Over the course of the anime, we get small hints of developing feelings that she might have for Tsuda. However, being a fully comedic anime, this hasn't really blossomed into a relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAria Shichijou, the school council secretary. Good grades, good manners, good at sports and also good looking. She comes from a rich family. But she's a bit of an airhead, too used to the comforts of her own home, as can be seen when she stands in front of a set of stairs for a while before realizing that it isn't an escalator. Or standing in front of sliding doors before Tsuda reminds her that they aren't automatic. She seems to have the same immature mindset as the president.\\n\\n\r\nSuzu Hagimura, the school council accountant. \"I'm a returning student with an IQ of 180! I speak fluent English, and can easily do 10 digit calculations in my head! The student council wanted to use my talents and recruited me as an accountant! Now, Will you stop treating me like a kid?\" This introduction of her in the anime perfectly describes her. Usually, only the top of her head is shown when the characters stand up beside each other. Or sometimes she isn't even in the shot but there's an arrow pointing down stating her position. I find this hilarious xD\\n\\n\r\nTakatoshi Tsuda, the school council vice-president. From the very beginning of the anime, it is actually unclear what his personality is like. He dressed improperly for his first day of school and was stopped by Shino before being recruited in to the school council. Eventually, we find out that he is quite a hard worker (as shown when he cleans the bathroom until it shone) but sometimes gets distracted easily (he was actually supposed to do school council work until his sister asked him to clean the bathroom). It may seem as though he has a harem due to the fact that 99% of the other characters seem to be female, however, relationships between him and any of the girls are not really discussed throughout the anime unless for comedic purposes.\\n\\n\r\nSide/minor characters. Some characters such as Hata Ranko from the newspaper club who seems to permanently hold on to her camera so that she can find a 'scoop' to sell. Monotonous voice and bland eyes go extremely well with her character due to the contrast between her features and the things she talks about. Kotomi Tsuda, the little sister of Takatoshi who seems to be a bro-con or at least is veeeeery perverted. Affectionately calls Takatoshi 'Taka-nii'. Uomi, the school council president of Eiryou high school. In SYD*, she becomes Takatoshi's cousin in-law. She seems to have some sort of feelings towards Tsuda and constantly discusses/compete for him with Shino. There are a few others, such as the androphobic Kaede Igarashi, a member of the disciplinary committee, the borderline sex offender (not that guys would say no to sex with a hot teacher) Yokoshima-sensei, Mutsumi Mitsuba, the president of the judo club (whom also seems to have some feelings towards Tsuda.... ok, I think all club presidents have a thing for him...) and then finally, the maid of the Shichijou household, Sayaka Dejima (as perveted, if not more, than Aria Shichijou. Dejima is constantly trying to get a hold of anything that Aria has bathed in, worn on or slept in.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis anime was a nice break from a few serious/feels shows (Steins;Gate, Shigatsu wa kimi no uso, Kokoro Connect to name a few) and I constantly go back to it for fast relief of stress. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI hope that one more season of Seitokai Yakuindomo will be released. Overall, this anime is brilliant for those of us seeking a rest from the darker, psychological anime.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading, check out my profile for a look at my other top anime and leave a comment there if you have any questions. Sorry for the large chunks of text and I hope that you will also fall in love with Seitokai Yakuindomo in the same was that I did.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~Avoklan",

It's full of jokes that would make even the biggest pervert laugh.\r\nDespite not having a plot, it still makes one look forward to the next episode and see what jokes the student council has in line for us. Sure, some of the jokes are predictable, but it's the unpredictability of when the punchlines would come out that made me laugh. Also, it's not ecchi, but it's more perverted than fanservice in anecchi anime, believe me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were interesting in their own way. The most interesting character for me would be Aria. Even as a lady, she still has her flaws. And those flaws are what makes her hilarious. She has no shame, and that's what makes her funny. There's also Shino, who acts like a curious little boy. Everything she says comes out of the blue.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was so addicting, it became a disease.

It is overloaded with misinterpreted situations where anything you say can be turned either into a joke or a sexual reference. For me the funniest part of it is that the entire school used too be an all girl school, so every girl there talks VERY openly about their \"monthly cycle\" and other typical women issues, and the poor guys has to listen too all of it.\r\noverall an extremely enjoyable anime that makes you laugh within minutes.",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo is a rather simple series. The basic premise in a nutshell is that normal high school student is forced to join the Student Council in a school which was previously an all-girls shcool is now co-ed. Seems straightforward enough. However, the real charm and main attraction of the show is its cast of characters and how incredibly the perverted the jokes are without being an ecchi series.\r\nThe Good: Like previously mentioned, the show features an interesting cast of characters. Tsuda, who is our main character, acts like the straight-man of the series, usually replying with a quick retort or clever reaction. Shino, ourstudent council president, is one of the many sources of perverted-ness in the series. She will often make sexual references in attempt of humor. Aria, our other perverted character, will often say some outrageous sexual remarks, and the weird thing is that unlike Shino, Aria means it because of how dense and how much of an airhead she is. Finally, our beloved Suzu, the loli tsundere series, will also act like the straight-man of the show along with Tsuda, but the show always comments on her height because she is abnormally, yer adorably small for her age. The humor is hit or miss. The cast will either say something really clever or something really predictable. At most you will will get a few LOL moments, but most of the jokes will get a chuckle or even a smile from you. \\n\r\nThe art is rather simple and fits the the nature of the show. For perverted show, there was hardly ever any fanservice scenes, which is quite surprsing. \\n\r\nThe Meh: The music isn't to outstanding. I personally didn't like the opening song or ending song, and the background music isn't anything special. You will most likely just skip the OP and ED sequences because of how generic they are, but if you like this type of music, then by all means go ahead. The story is kind of non-existent. The story will sometimes try to have heart-felt moments, but it will hardly do anything to you unless you grew some attachment to some of the characters. The structure is kind of weird also. Based off a 4-koma manga, scenes usually last around 2-5 mintues, each ending in a joke, then quickly transitions to another scene, prepping up another joke. It isn't a fast paced series, each episode will revolve around a theme, whether it's a field trip episode or a festival episode, and just use that to set up jokes. And like said before, the humor is hit or miss. Some will episodes will be hilarious, while others will be slow and gather a few chuckles here and there.\\n\r\nThe series does enough to differentiate itself from other shows. I have to give credit that for a show about perverted teenagers (and some adults) it doesn't rely on fanservice, boob-shots, panty-shots, or anything of the sort. Instead it relies on it's interesting cast to deliver the jokes, followed by a clever comeback. This series isn't for everyone, but if you are looking for a simple series to pass the time, Seitokai Yakuindomo will fill in that space. However, this isn't the type of series you can't marathon becuase due to the nature of the series, one can only handle so much perverted-ness unlike our main man Tsuda\\n",

            "content": "MCSnapTurtle's Anime Reviews #2 : Seitokai Yakuindomo (and OVA)\r\nSPOILER FREE\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo seems like an anime based just based on sex jokes, however it it isn't that simple. It's quite funny and everything about it is amazing, except its decent story, but it is a slice of life anime, so i shouldn't judge its story too harshly.\r\nSTORY- Simply put it's a slice of life anime so the story isn't that great. However, this doesn't mean the story is bad in any way.  \r\nStory Score 7/10\r\nSTORY ELEMENTS- This anime isn't classified as a romance but i wish it was. The anime does hint at romance alot, however not every episode. The comedy on the other hand is well though out. If you're not perverted yourself, you may have some trouble understanding its sexual innuendos.\\n\r\nRomance Score 5/10 \\n\r\nComedy Score 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS- The characters are amazing. I love them. They are well designed except for one problem, the females in the anime are WAY TOO Perverted. Almost all the female characters in the anime are overly perverted except for a few. However this is an anime based on sex jokes, so if the characters are not perverted it wouldn't really work. However they are mostly static throughout the anime.\\n\r\nCharacter Score 9.25/10\\n\\n\r\nART- The art is amazing. It may not be the most detailed but i like its art styles. The characters look amazing too. \\n\r\nArt Score 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND- The sound is also amazing. The voice actors are great and the music is truly amazing. For some reason the music in this anime sound very much like the music in Pokemon. Maybe because both of them use symphony music. \\n\r\nSound Score 10/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- I LOVE this anime. i really recommend this anime to almost anyone (unless they're not into sex jokes). This anime does so many things right, except for its mediocre story.\\n\\n\r\nI RECOMMEND THIS ANIME for:\\n\r\nPerverts\\n\r\nNormal people\\n\r\nAlmost everyone\\n\\n\r\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ANIME for: \\n\r\nNon-perverts\\n\r\nPeople that get offended easily\\n\\n\r\nAnime Rating 9.75/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment rating 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks For Reading and don't forget to click helpful if you thought my review was good! Have a nice day! \\n",

            "content": "One of the hidden gems in Anime that I came across luckily. (Spoilers)\r\nI found this anime after finally finishing up B Gata H Kei hoping to find something similar in the sexual jokes genre. Sure enough, I started watching this show that started out seemingly innocent and slowly became one of the funniest animes I've ever seen.\r\nThe story revolves around an all-girls school that recently turned co-ed with the start of the new year. The main character, Tsuda Takatoshi, is one of the first boys to enter into the school. You might be thinking, \"Oh, another perfect harem scenario.\", but as you watch more, yourealize you were further from the truth.\\n\\n\r\nComing from a die-hard harem fan, I thought I wouldn't enjoy this anime that much due to the lack of romance/fawning over the MC. However, there is light romance that is implied in some of the scenes along with amazing characters and great comedy to make every episode seem short and leave you wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is great. It revolves around the student council getting the MC tangled in many of their affairs as they forcefully recruit him to the club. There is a light-hearted plot that is continued every episode and is a slice of life sort of feel. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is definitely different from what I've watched, but it was very nice on the eyes and enjoyable. All the scenery and pictures seemed very high definition and great for the year this show was released.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn't something crazy original or epic, but it's also very enjoyable and comes in at the right times. Simple saxophone songs and other instrumentalesque tunes make this anime a very relaxing watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in my opinion are perfect. Tsuda is a very laid back and witty guy who keeps all of the student council members in check. As the MC, he's not one of those weak/dumb perv MC's and he makes the anime fun with his witty retorts. Shino and Aria are the president and secretary respectively both looking very innocent on the outside, but the stars of most of the perversion through their punchlines/jokes. Suzu is the cute, midget character of the anime who provides backup keeping Shino and Aria in line whilst maintaining her own fun character of verbally killing anyone who calls her short. The other supporting characters are all very individualistic and each have their own colors. It's very amusing watching how the MC's and SC's interact and the storyline they build.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my enjoyment of this anime was definitely a 10/10. I rewatched this anime twice in a month and I don't consider anything below a 10 rewatchable that soon. If you want a hilarious anime with a bunch of sexual jokes that come at the most unexpected times, watch this anime and thank me later.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Seitokai Yakuindomo\" is about an all girls school recently made Co-Ed, 3 women on the student council, two with a very sexually active mind, and one who has an IQ of 180, can easily do 10 digit math problems in her head, and can speak fluent English as well as other languages.\r\nAnd 1 guy gets in the middle of it all after transferring to the school because it's close.\r\nAfter Shino Amakusa spots Tsuda with his tie loose \"Because you don't want to be seen as a loose man. I look tight, so I am not seen as a loose woman!\", after a comedic scene, shebasically forces him to join the student council for a male view on things.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest are a bunch of jokes.\\n\\n\r\nNow, is that a bad thing?\\n\r\nTo me, no it is not.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWhat is story?\\n\r\nWe all know that there can be romance, military war, political battles, epic space warfare, battle of the wits, adventure, shojou, ect.\\n\r\nBut can story also be well written and well timed jokes as well?\\n\r\nIn this context, I would assume so, yes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is basically about the antics of these 4 people and all of the sexual humor you can throw a stick at.\\n\r\nIf you do not like jokes about sex, women, men, naughty situations, D*ck$, V@g*n@$, @$$, C*m (seriously), and B**bs.\\n\r\nYou may have a heart attack watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nI must mention, the story progression is directed in the same way as LuckyStar, where the scenes progress as joke by joke by joke, the scenes change by scene. It does not progress like a normal series.\\n\r\nHere, it works very well, just like LuckyStar.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI actually liked the artwork in this production quite a lot.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are generic, but detailed.\\n\r\nThe characters are drawn in an elongated fashion (Could be a new Seitokai Yakuindomo joke, if you catch my drift), but it fits the show very well.\\n\r\nThe choice of changing from basic anime look to chibi look when telling a really over the top joke, was hard to get use to at first, but you definitely get used to it after a couple epsiodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music is relaxing and fits whatever scene when it is needed very well, for comedic effect of course.\\n\r\nThe seiyuu are top notch in their talent here, especially in comedic timing and effect.\\n\r\nThe sound effects add to special comedic moments when needed, especially the jokes about man and woman juices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAgain, there can be a lot of character and no character at all.\\n\r\nIt all depends on your perspective.\\n\r\nIn my opinion there is a lot of character in this series, albeit perverted and more towards male fantasy, there's still character.\\n\\n\r\n\"Shino Amakusa\" is the counsel President, and her mind is always fixated on finding the perverted in everyday activities. Especially when it comes to Tsuda, even though she actually likes him in the strange scenes that you will see them together in.\\n\\n\r\n\"Aria Shichijou\" is basically Shino's rich and classy protege of sexual conversation, yet her sexual jokes are \"Quite heavy\" even for Shino.\\n\\n\r\n\"Suzu Hagimura\" is the most mature of the bunch, she has an IQ of 180, can 10 digit math- ect. ect.\\n\r\nBut she has one problem that you may notice at the start of the show, she's about the size of a toddler.\\n\r\nShe is very sensitive about her height, and becomes quite angry when joked about being a child.\\n\\n\r\n\"Takatoshi Tsuda\" is the UNfortunate target of sexual conversation, sounds like a good thing right? Well, not when they think you're a pervert who masturbates every time he goes to the bathroom, and if is late to a meeting, is probably having an affair with the teacher (Which would not be very hard to do with the counsel advisor, as I will explain in a second) in the next classroom.\\n\r\nHe's never annoyed enough by this to see the principal, or the police for that matter, but I digress.\\n\r\nHe's a very normal guy who is not interested in the Harem school life that the other guys in the school fantasize about.\\n\\n\r\nNaruko Yokoshima is the Student Counsel advisor, and a teacher at the school, she is (no surprise) a perverted woman with nothing on her mind but sex.\\n\r\nIt is quite ridiculous how much she thinks about it. She's even more perverted than a guy shooting himself up with testosterone on a treadmill getting drunk while getting a BJ. I'm serious.\\n\r\nAnd the things that she says are hilarious!\\n\r\nShe has a thing for younger guys though, so watch out, she may attack you, and trust me, you'll be running.\\n\r\nOr at least that is how the show portrays her.\\n\\n\r\nAll the extra characters you will see along the way are just as perverted (except for Naruko), so get ready for an avalanche of sexual humor.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series.\\n\r\nI enjoyed it a lot in fact.\\n\r\nI was always excited to see a new episode.\\n\r\nThere are no points that will depress you, they just stay far enough from being offensive (For me at least), and the overall unique way the show is presented was very fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis is a show full, and I mean the glass is overflowing with sexual humor.\\n\r\nIf you ever wanted a show about woman who talk about sex in an over the top, comical way, this isn't just recommended, it is a must watch.\\n\r\nAnyone who do not like sexual humor, and/or are easily offended by it, stay far away.\\n\r\nAmazingly enough, Seitokai Yakuindomo it is not an Ecchi, even though there are probably 1,000 jokes about it in this show.\\n\r\nI'm perfectly fine with that, in fact, I welcome it.\\n\\n\r\nI for one, would love to see more if there ever will be.\\n\r\nThis show actually makes me want to read the manga too.",

You are caught off guard and slightly started, she didn't knock.\" HA! Caught you masturbating huh?\", she asks. But no...you weren't...\r\nAaaaaand that is what this show is pretty much like. Personally I think the anime is a little bit overrated so below I will give my personal thoughts.\r\nHopefully you won't go into Seitokai Yakuindomo thinking it's a slice of life/comedy/ romance/school like me. And you might be disappointed. \r\nStory-6- Tsuda, is a male student who enrolls into a previously all-girlsschool. (*GASP* OMG have we heard this before?). He joins the student council on the first day of school and we follow his adventures with his sempais from there.\\n\\n\r\nAaaaaaaand, that's pretty much the whole plot of the story. Because yeah, this anime...no plot. The story is your old \"boy goes to previously all-girls school\" type. You might think that the anime has plunged straight toward a pitfall trap, but it doesn't. LUCKILY Tsuda is not the only guy at the all girls school, otherwise it'd be a perfect harem. And the other guys (BARELY even mentioned in the anime) are the only reason keeping the story above a 5.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7- I watched in 1280, the art was OK. Like I like to say a lot. It wasn't OMG MIND BLOWING. At times it was slightly lacking though. Oh! I forget to mention, the one problem I had with the art. Tsuda (the main character)  has a little sister, THEY LOOK ****ING IDENTICAL *** IS THIS? \\n\\n\r\nNow now, calm down all of you. You might justify it with \"well they are related they will look alike\". HOWEVER, if you look closely.. Tsuda's little sister has the  EXACT same face and hair as Tsuda EXCEPT for 2 pigtails added on. This is not \"related, so they look alike this is: copy, past, add pigtails and hope viewers don't notice.\\n\\n\r\nSound-6-The music for this anime was a big of a drag. The opening was annoying so I skipped it after the first time. The background sounds were simplistic but did their job. Voice acting at times was bland.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-6- For Seitokai Yakuindomo, another one of its weak-spots is its characters. The characters, are not developed....like AT ALL past episode 1",

Because the characters are great, the jokes will make you cry from laughing & the style of animation is also great! The comedy is really mature, because of the use of sexual jokes, so it's targeted mostly towards adults, but it's fine if you understand that kinda stuff, since it's doesn't have any imagery of sexual content. I totally recommend this series because it's on my top 10.",

Most of the humor must have been involving word play that didn't carry over because some characters would say one thing and then another would respond with something completely unrelated.

            "content": "There honestly isn't much to explain about Seitokai Yakuindomo, especially story wise.  It kind of hard to explain without actually spoiling things, but I'll make a brief attempt anyway.\r\nThere pretty much isn't a story.  What your read in the description is all you get.  This is just an episodic slice of life that focuses heavily on comedy, with much of it being sexual jokes.  I was brief just like I said I would be.\r\nThe sound, animation, and art were all really well done.  I read somewhere that this is adapted from a manga with a bunch of one line jokes,which kind of shows, but it flows very nicely considering that fact.  I like the opening theme, which is very cheerful and it includes sexual references, which should be expected from a show with the type of description this has.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you're someone who hates it when there really isn't any character development, don't even consider watching this anime.  The characters in Seitokai Yakuindomo do not grow at all.  Every character just has fun personalities that you'll either love or hate from the start.  I personally loved them and think each character added something special to the show even if only for a short time.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter seeing that I really don't have much information written about the show, you're probably wondering why I gave the anime a 9.  That's an easy question to ask.  I found it be really enjoyable and I was laughing about every few seconds.  It's just such a simple, yet very entertaining and enjoyable at the same time.  For like 90% of the show being pretty much just sexual jokes mixed with a tiny bit of other comedy, it's surprisingly a great show.  Of course if you hate sexual jokes, you won't think this same way.  I'm really surprised that a slice of life anime can include the content of Seitokai Yakuindomo, since I expect this genre to be more about just cheerful things and everyday life and not lewd in anyway.  Now that you've read this, decide your fate: watch it and laugh and or feel ashamed for doing so; or skip this one and potential regret not giving it a chance.",

            "content": "CAUTIONARY WARNING:  If you are uncomfortable with innuendo or any sort of sexual related content, STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS ANIME (and this review as well).  Sex jokes is to SYD as large breasts are to HSOTD.  Basically, there's a lot of it, and I would suggest to stay away if you do not like that sort of content.  \r\nOh dear god.  Where the hell do I begin?  Let's see...umm...yeah, I got nothing.  Shino: \"You mean, you're still a virgin?\"  Me:  \"How did this conversation get to this point?  And frankly, how are youhere?\"  Yeah, that about sums up the anime.  \\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10): First of all, there's a story?  I kid, kind of.  Seitokai Yakuidomo is a very odd anime.  The story itself has little to no merit, as I can literally sum it up in 4 words.  \"Student Council piss about\".  To be frank, it's basically a slice of life anime that's about the student council of Ousai Academy doing whatever they can to be entertaining.  Whether it'd be working as the student council, messing about somewhere in the school, taking a beach vacation, or making the hundreds (yes, hundreds) amount of sex jokes and innuendo.  (The amount is insane).  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10): Compared to the actual story, the characters exceed it by a milestone.  (Or, a 2 point rating).  The characters in this anime are a vibrant mix, from the pure minded and innocent Mitsuba, to the tainted mind of the student council president.  Where the story lacks, the characters make up for in full.  There's no character development that is too noticeable, and the grand scheme of the anime altogether is based around their individual personalities and odd quirks that make up the show's quality.  All in all, the characters are the highest point of the whole series due to how zany and funny they truly are.  \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8/10 and 7/10): The art is pretty damn good.  The art itself is split into 2 categories.  Chibi, and normal.  From a chibi standpoint, the art style is quite simple and less detailed.  Their eye detail is replaced by black slits, and that's the art style that is used whenever something is funny/joke related.  The other is a \"normal\" anime style with quite crisp colors and overall good and nice art that is very pleasing to look at.  (especially in HD)  The anime constantly switches between these 2 art styles, to the point that it makes it cohesive and required for its storytelling and punchline delivery.  The sound though is sort of generic.  It's happy and bright, cheerful and nice to listen to, but to me, it's not too memorable.  It's still nice though.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9/10): The abbreviation for this anime is SYD; more like STD, am I right?  (Yeah, bad joke.  Sorry).  Basically, this show is infectious.  Once you start, it's unlikely that you'll want to stop.  The series itself has an odd quirk to it, that just makes it so fun to watch.  I enjoyed every second of it, and the comedy just came and came and came and came.  *looks at previous sentence* (I disappoint myself sometimes.)  With its wonderful characters, good art, and hilarious comedy just bursting with sex jokes, I felt really awkward, but entertained at the same time.  I will watch the OVA's and the second season.  Just for the simple reason that I enjoyed this a lot.  Don't judge me.",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo is one of those animes that start out with a bang and ends quietly. The first few episodes were very enjoyable, but it started to get repetitive after the 8th episode. It is roughly based on the manga, which takes the form of a comic strip. This anime is pure comedy so if you were hoping for an adventure, sorry to disappoint you. Nevertheless, it does fulfill its role as a comedy with its many sexual jokes.\r\nArt (6/10)\r\nSimply put: the art in this anime isn't that great. After watching a few episodes you'll get the feelings that... well ...everyone looks the same. Mostguys are drawn like Tsuda and most girls are drawn similar to Shino. At one point I was quizzical on why the Student Council president was asking the Student Council VP to help her start a club. Then I realized that it wasn't the Student Council president... just someone who looks almost the exact same. If they start making the second season, art would be one thing that I hope they will improve on.\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10)\\n\r\nBecause this anime is a comedy, I didn't really expect much of a story. It's loosely based on the life of Tsuda, freshman at a recently integrated, previously all female, Osai Academy. On the first day of class, he is pulled away by the student council consisting of the President, Shino; the secretary Aria, and the loli treasurer Hagimura. As apology for making him late to his first day of class, they gave (forced onto ) him the position as Student Council VP. This 13 episode series roughly outlines their year together in the student council and ends with the end of the school year. Although there does seem to be some love tension between Shino and Tsuda, it is never developed on because the main purpose of this anime is to crack sex jokes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are humorous and likable. Tsuda seems to be the only normal person in the council and, hence, the only person who stops Shino's and Aria's sexual jokes. Shino, the president, has perverted fantasies and is simply fascinated by male penis (don't worry there's no nudity in this anime). Aria, the secretary, is beautiful and nice but even more perverted than Shino, often cracking random sex jokes in the most awkward situations. Hagimura, the loli treasurer, hates being referred to as short and has a quite temper when she is called a \"kid\". None of the characters seems to be particularly serious throughout this anime. Almost everything they say or do is simply for LOL and maybe even a ROFLCOPTER.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nSeitokai Yakuindomo provides a nice relief from other intense and action packed anime. Even though the art was mediocre, the content was there. One issue that lessen the effect of the anime is that most jokes are revealed through puns. Instead of actually understanding what they say (since japanese romaji has multiple meanings), you get a subtitle that says \"Blahblahblah is playing on words. She said blahblah which is a play on words of blahblah\". But I guess that's the price to pay for not being able to understand Japanese in a comedy anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nThis is probably one of the best (and few) comedy animes I've watched. Most of the jokes are understandable and the producers really seem to give the anime the \"common man\" appeal. They put notices and jokes on there that gives viewers the impression that they are also kids who love anime. So if you're tired from watching action animes with never-ending suspense and need a break, Seitokai Yakuindomo is a good anime to just watch and relax, maybe even lol a bit. If you're not quite the comedy anime fan, then don't bother with this.",

They fit perverted jokes so well in EVERYTHING that's just hilarious and they barely even use actual ecchi scenes. Every single characters is simply awesome and It's hard not to drop a tear when it ends and you know that you won't have any more bad sex jokes coming from the council president. If you love sex jokes, you're really going to have a good time with this one, trust me.",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo requires a specific taste in order to enjoy. The comedy is fast-paced with almost 100% of it being sexual puns, word plays with double meanings. The series runs without an underlying plot, but does a fair job going into some of the characters backgrounds and personalities.\r\n~Story 6/10~\r\nThere is no grand-underlying plot, it's just a show full of random events and jokes within a 9 month period. I am not disappointed in the randomness, but I am disappointed that there weren't any romantic strings being pulled throughout the series. There were a few spots here and there where romantic flags pop up but theyonly last for a few seconds then it's back to sexual puns.\\n\\n\r\n~Art 8/10~\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good actually. It is a near perfect fit for this kind of random comedy show. The backgrounds are well detailed and the art style did not change  constantly, which is a big plus for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe scene sequences are often the same ones you'd see in almost every single anime show. A beach, a school/academy, giant mansion, an inn, you'll also go through an athletic festival  a cultural festival, entrance exams and an entrance ceremony. All in synch with other anime shows.\\n\r\nYou just know there will always have to be a beach scene, it just never fails to show up.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound 6/10~\\n\r\nAlthough Dialogue was the main focus of this show, the dialogue was fast-paced all the time. As someone who isn't up-to-date on all the cultural references, I tend to have to read the notes that help explain the word play being used and by the time I get a few words of it read, the dialogue has already changed to something else.\\n\\n\r\nThe word play and disjunct conversations between two or more people gets frustrating after a while. For example in an episode someone said, \"stand\", but instead someone interpreted it as \"penis.\" That is the kind of word play you'll see and hear throughout the ENTIRE show. So, if that is your kind of humor, then enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n~Character 6/10~\\n\r\nThere was nothing very deep about the characters. Most were just shells of a complex personality. The characters are also not very unique in nature. There is a dense guy with common sense, a flawless female as student council president, a klutz with big breasts and a short genius girl.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment 7/10~\\n\r\nI often found myself frustrated and sighing because the pace was just took quick. I can read the subs pretty fast, but even the dialogue speed was took quick.\\n\\n\r\nThe constant use of word play and sexual puns were just too much. At first it was appealing and acceptable, but by episode  8, I just had enough.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, I did enjoy the series for the most part and I would recommend this to others, especially those who love dirty jokes and dirty word play.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Subs Used :: Ayako]",

If it wasthe guy it would just be the same-old same-old but the female mains and the straight man male lead is just enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial shout out goes to my favorite side character Hata, the head of the Newspaper club. Monotone and single minded in getting \"scoops\" and sell-able photos of the main characters she to me is one of the funniest characters in the show cause of some of the havok she creates.

The anime holds no punches and is very lewd. If you dislike sex jokes then this is not the anime for you! If you're immature like I am then this anime should suit you well. This anime has an almost unimportant story due to the fact that each episode is really just finding ways of making more and more jokes, some of which are quite intelligent but more often that not it's just silly funjokes. There is a bit of romance like feeling through the anime but its mainly used for gags so don't be expecting too much in the romance department.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is one of my favourites because its funny, feel good, really lifts the spirit kind of anime with little drama. If you're feeling down this is the kind of anime which will help you get laughing again, well it did for me anyhow. Although the anime is built on sex jokes it isn't at all ecchi, so don't be expecting fan service. I would recommend this anime to anyone as it is a must watch in my book (and the 2nd season.) \\n\\n\r\nPlease make sure you watch Seitokai Yakuindomo first and not Seitokai Yakuindomo* which is the second season. * is the difference!",

            "content": "Sex jokes are often done tastelessly in comedy, and that's a given considering how childish they often are. Still, I've got to give credit to Seitokai Yakuindomo, or SYD, for being just that in a nutshell while being mildly entertaining.\r\nI've actually been reading the 4-koma for a while now, so I knew what I was expecting. For those who aren't familiar with this anime being thrown around for what it's known for, SYD is fundamentally what you would imagine if adult humor had its own consciousness and manifested into a TV series. Double entendres and deadpan humor come from all sides of this show, andyou will barely get a break. Of course, this means that this is definitely not suitable for kids. Don't let them watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does SYD fare in comparison to the sea of lewd that is ecchi and hentai lurking from Japan's questionable fetishes? Well, it's a surprise because this anime is not ecchi AT ALL. What SYD pulls off uniquely is its ability to be a innuendo-filled show without relying too much on visual, gratuitous display of female body parts. Heck, even the fanservice scenes are barely anything of service.\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast of characters contains the Student Council that serve as archetypes of typical Japanese comedy, which shouldn't be a surprise as 4-komas generally have that setup. The role of straight-man or tsukkomi is often given to Takatoshi Tsuda, the main character and vice president, and Suzu Hagimura, the council's resident genius and shorty. Meanwhile, the role of the funny man or the boke is presented through Shino Amakusa, the president and Aria Shichijou, Shino's best friend, co-pervert and secretary. While nothing can be much said about their characters as they're only often devices to set up the jokes, their differences with each other and with the supporting cast help make the comedy of the show consistent all throughout. Also, there's a little bit of characterization for Shino, who is my favorite of the cast (because black haired girl bias).\\n\\n\r\nDespite the comedy being consistent at most, it never reaches a level of being genuinely funny\u2014a few jokes here and there will make you grin, but nothing more. This becomes a problem as the show goes on, as its starting ground was barely above average to begin with. Don't get me wrong, I find sex jokes hilarious, but SYD suffers from being commonly executed in the same manner but with a different punchline. The jokes being animated from the manga were a plus, but it seems to fare in an underwhelming way on both mediums. However, since comedy is subjective, some may find it funnier than I did.\\n\\n\r\nOne difference I did like from the anime was its inclusion of a subplot, and the show seems to hint more on Shino and Tsuda's relationship undertones farther than its source material. They also included several original content that made me remember the earlier chapters in a refreshing way. Though the studio could have stopped there, they felt the NEED to add in more scenes to fit the runtime, and that's where I was sorely disappointed. These segments that have nothing to do with the plot or the characters suddenly appear for an unnecessarily extended amount of time, and it waters down the excitement to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest let-down was the final episode, which works as a parody of the series itself and the fourth wall monster let hell loose and everyone became so self-aware that this was an anime. As a matter of fact, I love fourth wall humor, but not when it's overused to the point that it's just a copout to extend past the 20-minute mark.\\n\\n\r\nThere's so much more SYD's first season could have done, like build on the existing character relationships past the comedy vibe (if they were going to add in subplots, why not do it all the way?) or add in more content from the manga so as not to rely on half-assed segments that should belong in another anime. SYD's forte is sex jokes, and it still pulls it off much better than any anime similar to it. Even if it wasn't as good as a comedy, it was still enjoyable to some extent. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone, though, and that's not just for its NSFW content.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, maybe the OVAs and the second season is better. Just not for this one.",

Especially of the idea that only females in this show are always aroused by sexual fantasies andconstant sex inundated experiences occur from the female characters towards the male(s) and, even though it is a show and it is fiction, still sounds ludacris and inane.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10:\\n\r\nPersonally felt that there were plots in the show where it tends to go somewhere that leads to a story where it follows how the characters will go in adventures or perform \"action\" like scenes but then it leads to wasteful plots where it is like fillers and that also was a peeve to me for this show. \\n\\n\r\nIn some episodes it concentrates to what the show has set the plot for but then later goes to more fillers and more and more of them. The reason why there are so many fillers is because in the actual manga it reads many \"jokes\" and small plots and so the creators must have thought it would have been great if they just quickly smoosh up all the manga work together in less than 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: \\n\r\nI liked the artwork and especially in some episodes where it tends to get so realistic like and the details of every scene is always constructed will thought out its like a dream! Not a miss anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\r\nThe sound of this show was simple and great fit and comfort for it as well where not like other shows where it carries a certain type of music always playing whenever a character is speaking (Ex: in DBZ when Vegeta talks his Hells Bells performs in the background) so basically in this show is a free-for-all music type.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10:\\n\r\nThe characters well... were not that well thought out, they all remind me of shows similar to Rosario + Vampire where there are females who always have sexual references being mentioned, act immature, and always go for the innocent one male character and constant pointless plots happen all the time (fillers). This really should have been improvised upon but what can you do.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 7/10:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show because it did have some funny plots, the switched off stories were very attention grabbing and was an interesting show to watch. This show however is sincerely meant for how it is rated, 17+, since this how is just plain dirty and no young child should go near this. It is a cute show though and very enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThank for reading!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo is an anime with a main purpose of making the viewer laugh with obvious but innocent sexual jokes. Truthfully it's a comedy anime that I liked because it made me laugh all the time. With the many sexual jokes coming from the characters there is the whole \"one person dealing with everyone else's awkwardness\" in a school setting like this one. Also the jokes don't stop with just the student council or the school. There are many more characters in the series that are basically the same outside of the \"main\" school. I'd say if you like the Ecchi and Comedy type ofanime you should at least give this one 2 episodes because at the beginning it does start off a little slow.",

The jokes are great, not for those who don't understand the nature of sexual jokes, however, not all the jokes are sexual, as in seen in episode 3 when Hagimura Suzu goes mad and starts swearing in English.\r\nAs for the story, well, to put it bluntly, what story? Haha, all it revolvesaround is a group of High Schoolers running their Student Council while getting up to shenanigans and having a huge laugh with each other. What I thought made it all so much funnier is Tsuda's comments after every punchline of the jokes, where he either agrees, or is appalled by the joke, this is the same with the Student Council rules they would state at the beginning of every episode, sure they started out reasonable, but then they became absolutely ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound of this anime was great, the characters in themselves were just amazing to watch and so funny to be able to just laugh as much as I wanted at, as for enjoyment, 10 out of 10, easily, I loved this anime due to how much it made me laugh and clutch my sides from the burning pain I felt from laughing too much.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first anime review, hope it was of use to some people :D",
