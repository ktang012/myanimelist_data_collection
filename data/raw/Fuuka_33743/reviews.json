            "content": "My opinion: \r\nClichefest merged with shitfest. \r\nFor most of the duration of this show I was in a self-induced comatose state as a defense mechanism against the utter stupidity of the show.\r\nFuuka is one of the most forced drama series I have ever seen and it was a painfully generic and cliched show to watch. Fuuka is one of the worst excuses for media-entertainment that I've ever seen and this is no exaggeration. My reaction after finishing its 12 dreadful episodes is one of repulsion, disgust, and pure anger. \r\nStory: 2/10\r\nI do not seek to offend anyone but this show\u2019s plot seems to be writtenin the image of a teenager\u2019s sexual fantasies, following a juvenile course that I often found irritating.\\n\r\nThe story revolves around the unusual girl, Fuuka, and a new shy transfer student, Yuu Haruna and the popular singer Koyuki Hinashi. This plot is not just utterly generic but also filled with holes, conveniences, cringe worthy lines, it is cliched to the point that cliches form a large part of the story, it is poorly paced and poorly constructed with a poor execution.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of this show I had the feeling it was going to be bad, very bad. \\n\r\nIn the first few minutes we see a forced and cliche scene where Fuuka runs into Yuu and both of them end up in an awkward and embarrassing situation where Yuu is accused of taking pictures of Fuuka\u2019s underwear. Next thing we see is Fuuka smashing Yuu\u2019s phone and then running off, where the f is she running to?... Never mind that, the following day Fuuka invites Yuu, who she a few days before accused of being a complete pervert, to a very requested concert\u2026 getting past the imbecilic story-line, where does Fuuka get her money from to be able to throw around front-row tickets to a popular concert. From here on, Yuu and Fuuka will grow closer through numerous plot conveniences and cliche scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many unbelievable coincidences and imbecilic actions to the point you lose track of their number, they just keep coming, being shot at the show with a machine gun. \\n\r\nFor instance, we have members from the famous band \u201cHedgehogs\u201d being school staff (what\u2019s the chance of that?) but huge Hedgehogs fans can't recognize a single member from their favorite band. The protagonists just end up working over the summer with a member of that same famous band as their boss; the girl that ran into the male lead turns out to be in his class, etc. \\n\r\nIn one episode, far from the beach, Yuu almost drowns trying to save Fuuka from drowning and then he is showed on the beach being resuscitated by Fuuka, through the mouth-to-mouth method (cliche). How the heck did Fuuka mannage to carry the unconscious Yuu back to the beach before he died? \\n\r\nThat\u2019s a shitload of hard to believe coincidences and actions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor a music show this is very poorly done. Apparently it is very easy to play musical instruments, you just need to be briefly told how to do it, no practice needed and you just need to be a random girl who sings in the shower in order to be a good cover artist and vocalist. \\n\r\nThis show is offensive to real artists and the work they put in\u2026 these few students start playing a song without knowing the notes or the song itself, their instruments or even which instrument they would like to play and succeed in playing that song. Planning to create a new song? Fuuka will compose it in two days. Oh, just give me a break!\\n\r\n\"Here, Yuu-kun, you'll play bass while we see if Fuuka's got talent because reasons!\" - just another imbecilic course of action.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama is made up of plot conveniences that are thrown together forming a complete mess and not only that but it is one of the most forced and cliche I have ever seen. We have the generic \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d between characters that stretch out over 1-3 episodes only to be solved with two words, poorly done drama.\\n\r\nOf course, we have a cliche love triangle made up by Fuuka, Yuu and the childhood friend, Koyuki. This drama failed before it began, I already knew Koyuki will lose based on her shallow and dull personality, not only did the love triangle drama fail but it failed miserably.\\n\\n\r\nNext on the list: Ecchi scenes. The ecchi scenes are so forced that they insult my intelligence. \\n\r\nHow the hell does Yuu pulling his jacket off Fuuka result in Fuuka with her arms out of the jacket and up, her shirt pulled halfway up her chest and his hand under her shirt? \\n\r\nJackets do not work that way, falling does not work that way. There is no way this \u201caccident\u201d could happen. You can't accidentally turn away from somebody wearing the same jacket, accidentally pull them underneath you and then also accidentally pull up their shirt and fondle their tits.\\n\r\nThis is levels beyond the dumb anime logic I am used to, it makes an art out of being an idiotic show. I can suspend disbelief but now you are asking the impossible! And what the fck is up with the \u201csisters\u201d that are always half-naked?\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is predictable and all the twists are predictable, once a character is introduced you already know how it will end up, removing any potential tension that may intrigue the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nThe characters are generic, cliche, one-dimensional (absolutely no development), poorly built and ultimately hollow having no real personality. These characters live in the bullshit land too.\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist, Yuu Haruna is a generic run-of-the-mill, dense high-schooler who keeps getting into perverted and embarrassing situations over and over again and later not understand what's going on.\\n\r\nHe is also unable to properly share his thoughts with other characters, especially Fuuka, therefore creating cheap drama and a state of confusion. \\n\r\nWhen faced with an obstacle he adopts the generic \u201cI\u2019ll do my best\u201d mentality and through plot convenience he will achieve his goal.\\n\r\nIn the very first episode we can see the excellent patience and kindness of the main character. Within just two days,Yuu gets his precious phone broken twice by the same woman. Normally, I would have been infuriated by this woman's actions, oozing with rage. But does our protagonist falter? No, he calmly just pays up several hundred dollars without protest or resentment. The story of our protagonist's kindness does not end here, no, no. See, the woman who broke his phone, twice, that is two fking times, did not ever compensate or apologize in the slightest for her actions, but luckily for her, our protagonist is a kind and patient man. Because he was such a gentleman, he took the lady out on a date to her favorite movie! How wonderful and kind!\\n\r\nEnough with the jokes, Yuu is a shit character.\\n\r\nHe is shy, kind and introverted. That\u2019s all I could get from him.\\n\\n\r\nFuuka is a difficult character to decipher because of how poorly she is constructed, one moment she acts defensive and violent and next she acts cuddly and romantic so I am left here wondering what the hell is going on with her. \\n\r\nFuuka is the generic \u201cstrange\u201d girl that stands out through her cheerful and free-willed personality, she has numerous mood swings and oftens jumps to conclusions creating even more cheap drama. \\n\r\nShe once saw Yuu with his childhood friend and jumped straight to the conclusion that this friend is Yuu\u2019s girlfriend. After she runs away (cliche), Yuu tries to talk to her and to apologize (for what exactly?) but she gives him the cold shoulder until she punches him saying \u201cbaka\u201d in a generic tsundere voice, giving me a cringe-worthy memory.\\n\r\nIs Fuuka a female Naruto? She gets everyone to be her friend and follow her lead, if it\u2019s creating a band or going to work, her friends will follow her lead.\\n\r\nShe claims to have never been in love only to later figure out she \u201cloves\u201d Yuu. Oh, give me a fking break! Can this get any more cliche?\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters have zero, I mean 0 personality or development and are utterly forgettable. \\n\r\nThere is Makoto, the blonde gay guy who says lines like \u201cI saw a really hot lifeguard, gonna go and try to land a date\u201d who\u2019s only trait is being gay, there is Nachi who is just there, and there is Sara, ah, I already forgot what she was like.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation&art for this show is good at best. It is mostly fluid but has considerable flaws with the character design of adults, they look like teenagers as well with some of the backgrounds. While the animation is mostly fluid it does have moments when it feels laggard.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nDid I see a \u201cmusic\u201d tag? This show fails in the sound department.\\n\r\nThe opening theme is atrocious, painful to listen to and the ending theme is also bad but I didn\u2019t mind it that much mostly because I didn\u2019t concern myself with skipping it. The voice actors did a decent job but not spectacular in any way. \\n\r\nIn the end, the sound was really disappointing, having bad opening/ending themes and mediocre songs as an OST.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nWhenever I wasn\u2019t completely annoyed, I laughed at the show, not at the jokes but at how bad it was and the number of ways it failed. This show is a joke, that\u2019s the only excuse I can find for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nFuuka, a show featuring a bad plot accompanied by poor characters coming in a package with mediocre animation and sound. I recommend skipping Fuuka and never looking back at it.",

            "content": "Synopsis\r\nYuu Haruna just moved into town and loves to use Twitter. Out on his way to buy dinner, he bumps into a mysterious girl, Fuuka Akitsuki, who breaks his phone thinking he was trying to take a picture of her panties. How will his new life change now?\r\nFuck.\r\nStory: 4, generic hareming it up into a light music band. Nothing original in concept. However, the plot moves a fucking mile a minute - bad anime misunderstanding that stretch out into 1-3 whole episodes in other shows get fucking slammed into 6 minutes and are done with, whether the characters really should be over them or not.\r\nArt:4, looks decent but has absurd, erroneous cinematography issues. MC's phone gets thrown in a bush so he searches the same spot in a bush for 8 seconds. A boy in a sweatshirt during episode 4 stands up in an up and to the right maneuver, which somehow results in him flipping 540 degrees, putting the sweatshirt fully back on, and grabbing a girl's midriff.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6, yeah, sounds fine, except for whenever someone gets slapped by a male and it shatters their bones and the sound barrier.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2, dear god, what? Character motivations for being into the MC stand on barely any ground or none at all. Side characters show some spirit, but a lack of human logic.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character's a bland shy baby that the girls like for no reason.\\n\r\nFuuka is an enjoyably enthusiastic character but she's insane - shatters his phone one day, asks to see the picture the next. Super sensitive about her panties for the opening plot point, but then hangs her ass in front of the MC's face in a swimsuit without any concerns at all for minutes on end (her end am I right? Ba dum chhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I'm so alone). Characters act inconsistently in this show if it'll move the plot points along.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Honestly, 10. This is where the big money is. I'm having an amazing time riffing on this hot garbage with some friends and the experiences you have in life are all you have in life before you die and pass away and it's a good chuckle fest of laughing our asses off between the inconsistent characters, inconsistent editing and logicless mise en sc\u00e8ne found in some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this if you consider yourself a pseudo-intellectual and like to riff on anime with friends. \\n\\n\r\nThis quickly written review with a few holes in it brought to you by the fact that I couldn't just paste (from the synopsis, the bare minimum effort to characterize our blank slate MC) \"Yuu Haruna just moved into town and loves to use Twitter\" and the word \"Fuck\" and call it a day.",

            "content": "Through all the shitty fanservice shows and idol/music anime airing for this season, the two categories overlapped at this show.....Only it's mostly music and barely fanservice. This was not the best.\r\n First off, this show was one of the WORST dramas I've ever seen in my life. It's so forced and the pacing of everything is terrible. Everything is forced i this show. Someone will say something then infer the exact opposite or take something personally that wasn't directed towards them.The pacing could not be any worse. One event will happen right after the other and then they'll get distracted and go on to somethingelse entirely. (Also their \"problems\" are always solved within one episode.) The \"drama\" is just a bunch of plot conveniences and a stupid love triangle that makes no sense in the first place. The love triangle consists of Yukka(I think that's his name), Fuuka, and Koyuki. Only problem is that Yukka shows in one of the very first episodes to be more committed to Fuuka, than Koyuki and he does it time and time again showing he's more committed to Fuuka. This shows that it is unnecessary to even consider Koyuki an option, But for the sake of forced drama........\\n\\n\r\nThe charaters in this show are so bland. Starting with Yukka, he is the most boring. We all know that he is a stick in the mud,and he is antisocial??? That was all I could get from him. The blonde one is basically there just to clear up any \"drama\" between Yukka and Fuuka. Finally Fuuka,she is maybe the most interesting out of all of them. She likes to sing, she jumps to a lot of conclusions, and wants to make her own decisions. Fuuka never really goes beyond her character. She stays consistent with jumping to conclusions singing, and talking about bands, or wanting to start hers.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is good at best. At times it's inconsistant and almost jarring to even look at. It's color scheme it has is very cool, to which I have to commend them for. They made it so that the colors flow smoothly but the focus is still obvious.  It's character designs are good-looking, but like had said, it's almost jarring to look at them when they gook so off model with them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I was neutral to this show it was boring to be honest and the only things keeping me hooked were the opening song and fanservice. That can only get you so far though....\\n",

Fuuka, the main character, in my eyes is a person who doesn't afraid to take risks in her life but she is also too guarded and secretive. \r\nHowever the anime has suspense and it's being a little bit rushy at the beginning which makes you wonder, what it will become at the next episode? How things will end up now? So i see it as a positive thing! \r\nThe art is magnificent and everything looks sorealistic to me! It perfectly fits with the story and some backgrounds were outstanding! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all mixed up i'll say. Like our society, they are a variety of characters that they have different personalities, weaknesses and strengths but there is always a balance in between! They are all acting so realistic which satisfies me enough to not skip the anime!\\n\\n\r\nI am really enjoying the series, my overall score (by far) it's an 8 and if i'll enjoy it even more at the end i might give it a 9! The show is good i'll gladly recommend it to those who love Music and Romance type of anime!\\n\r\n Reply       My Messages       Delete",

            "content": "A show that\u2019s mediocre at best and harmless at worst.  If you\u2019ve seen Nisekoi and about a million other romantic comedies/dramas just like Fuuka, you won\u2019t find much different here.  This is something that is such familiar territory and for most people watching they should be desensitized to it by now.  The series exudes loads of fake stakes, fake drama, fake tension and of course the most beautiful of all contrived plot threads---convenience.  Let me be clear this isn't the worst thing I've seen, not even in this season, but it is still pretty lackluster. The main problem with this showisn\u2019t that it is offensive, but that it is tired and boring.\\n\\n\r\nTruly this show is just a forgettable slog.  Even with its faults being immediately obvious, this was still a difficult review to write. It wasn't difficult because the series is so bad, but because there really is nothing to talk about. This formula has been done to death and better in shows like Toradora, School Rumble, Ranma \u00bd, Rosario + Vampire, and Tenchi Muyo, which are far more worth your time than this. Hell, calling this series unimaginative is putting it lightly.  The dialogue gets so poor to the point where much of the later dialogue consists of the words \"I'm sorry\" over and over, until they really doesn't mean much anymore. \\n\\n\r\nThe series follows a teenager by the name of Yuu-- who\u2019s only defining character is that he uses Twitter and is dense as a brick-- and his relationships with several uninteresting girls who all want to get in his pants.  The most important girl of the harem, for reasons unknown-- as she\u2019s just about as well-developed as the rest-- being Fuuka (obviously).  Oh yeah and there's a music plotline that really isn't good either as the characters have no individuality or chemistry as a band.  None of these characters are interesting or enduring in the slightest.  The story is literally driven by the same mundane plot repeating every episode with little to no differences between them, if you\u2019ve watched episode one, you\u2019ve basically watched the entire series.  The main character can never decide on which girl he likes and each of them get upset with him for half the episode only to make up with him at the end. It's extremely predictable and you'll forget most of it shortly after completing it, which for a 12 episode series that's pretty atrocious. \\n\\n\r\nFuuka is one of those series, where most veteran anime fans can look at it immediately and say, \u201cNo one gave a single shit about this\u201d. There is no subtlety or tact in the narrative, plot conveniences are thrown at you as if the creators were self-aware of how bad the writing was.  Sometimes it was hard to even tell what was going on as quite a few characters backstories are poorly explained and have no relevance.  One second a character is overacting and the next they seem totally unphased by what's going on.  If a character needs to be in a certain place, they will be there.  If the story (air-quotes) needs dragging out, it will drag.  Poor plot conveniences are bad enough, but there really isn\u2019t much story at all anyway. The entire series amounts to what can best be described as filler content. The characters much like the writing have flat, unappealing and unmemorable designs, especially the background characters that tend to be even more forgettable.  Nothing stands out about anyone and it doesn\u2019t help that the animation is that a1 pictures style of animation that is very by the books and very on model. Characters rarely move in exciting or interesting ways.\\n\\n\r\nListen I can understand why series like this are popular.  People like to project themselves onto a character, because they relate to the subject at hand.  Even if the concept is dumb or has been done a million times before, that viewer doesn\u2019t care about that. The reason so many bad series get away with being defended by so many people is because they often grab the viewer\u2019s attention when they are emotionally weak and desperately seeking this type of content.  No genres are more guilty of character projection slates than the Romance and Ecchi genres.  The reason I am disclosing this information is because honestly I think somewhere, some side of me actually wanted to enjoy this series. But I rarely go watching something with the intention to hate it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nFuuka is a clear cut example of \u201cwhat you see is, what you get\u201d.  I don\u2019t recommend this series at all.  It shouldn\u2019t be physically painful or hard to watch, but it might have you rolling your eyes a few times.  I won\u2019t lie to you there were somethings that I thought were cute and even sweet, but the lack of story, character development, conflict, interesting or expressive animation make for a product that just isn\u2019t  quality. If you weren\u2019t watching it while it aired, don\u2019t bother or waste your time, this isn\u2019t a series that\u2019ll become an undiscovered classic anytime soon.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "== Warning: This Review will Contain Spoilers to Back Up My Claims towards the Show ==\r\nNote: If I need to correct myself in some areas of this review, please let me know.\r\nAs a person that has some bias with shows, there\u2019s to some degree where I can at the very least ignore issues or glaring flaws, as long as the show delivers to what it\u2019s either promised or should give some entertainment value to it, or even if I dislike a series, I can somehow see what it did well while I ain\u2019t the biggest fan of it. That\u2019s what matters to me the mostin the first point, but in some cases, there will be shows that are so rotten and outright oblivious that it\u2019s hard to even ignore the glaring flaws of them. Fuuka, is no exception of this sentence, as the show while it doesn\u2019t have a very promising premise, it all comes down to how the execution can be played, and frankly I\u2019m the type that can at least can see execution when done right, even if some shows weren\u2019t pleasing to me at the end of the day (example Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu as one of the more apparent examples, same can go with other shows). \\n\\n\r\nFuuka can be considered as one of those series that can have the potential to be at least somewhat decent with some good development and characters, but in the end of the day when the show came to the reach of its conclusion, everything in terms of the writing and the characters, and in terms of production and direction falls apart like when you\u2019re almost done with your best masterpiece of a castle. It falls apart around everything, hence it then turns into a pile of mess. \\n\\n\r\nAnd when I talk about mess, I mean the biggest literal mess of writing I\u2019ve seen in a while, and the last time I encountered this issue to where it actually genuinely frustrates me was last year, where I did my review for Divergence Eve which was pretty much aggravating to go through and it still lingered my mind to this day. To give into perspective, execution is what matters in many series in the industry. There\u2019s no more originality unless you dig a deep hell hole, and generic or clich\u00e9s cannot be avoided no matter how much you can probably try (unless you are a master of writing then that\u2019s good for you), what matters the most for it is how these generic and clich\u00e9s are handled in the process, which is the most essential thing to do. In Fuuka\u2019s case however, that\u2019s when the pile of shit falls on. The problem mainly for Fuuka is all about the execution, from the clich\u00e9s it uses to way it handles the interactions with the band itself, where it feels like it is more frustrating than a typical Light Novel adaptation due to the show\u2019s usage of them feeling off and disconnected, not only that it personally disturbed me. And when I say compared to a stereotypical Light Novel adaptation, that\u2019s just me giving props because I feel like by that, the way these types of shows uses its own clich\u00e9s for the most part are somehow mediocre, whereas Fuuka on the hand uses it in a way where it will tick me off every second, from the misunderstandings between the characters, towards the accidental boob grab, towards the typical panty shooting misunderstanding, to the entire conflict, etc. I could go on and point these out but these are more of the issues Fuuka as a series gets, mere poor execution for its own clich\u00e9s, as well as terrible execution for the drama itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor the drama it could be described as forced (as part of the execution point), as the entire situation with the band and the characters themselves do not feel normal with the flow, thus it feels like it\u2019s trying to make the entire development feel \u201creal\u201d but in the end it feels quite weird and it takes away the immersion. For example, Yuu learning a song in a short amount of time span. I\u2019m not a musician, but I\u2019m pretty sure you cannot learn a song in that time span, especially if you are considered a newbie to this sense unless you mastered a way to learn these things quickly, this can be placed on anything in the argument. It doesn\u2019t take like that amount of time to actually learn it, it takes maybe weeks, or around months to even remember a song, especially in a band to get on the beat and get the entire tone right and running. It doesn\u2019t take that short amount of time to even get it right, realistically speaking. And from my experience, despite not being a musician it took me at least months to year in playing a song in the instrument, and it wasn\u2019t even because I was participating on something. I just did it because I enjoy playing the piano, same can go with me singing an anime Opening accurately, and it takes a while especially if the lyrics are fast. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire character interactions comes off as rather poor or not very strong considering the characters do not really share any sort of love for the music or they want to actually want to be in the band for their reasons, and it doesn\u2019t seem to showcase this either for the most part. If the characters have developed or had some sort of fitting conflict with each other, for example, and them working together on something as a way to drive into characterization as well as character development, it could mostly be beneficial towards the band and the characters alone could be decently developed. But it was never done in any sort of way.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the first few issues the shows has: Mere poor execution on the clich\u00e9s, drama, and its characters. The second main issue I wanna go and talk about is mostly the characters themselves. Most of them, with the exception of Koyuki (being the only decent character in this entire show) are downright stupid, braindead, uninteresting as rocks, bland, or just outright dislikable beyond belief. To explain what I mean, the characters do not really have any sort of personality trait in them, not even a bit. They don\u2019t really have much of a goal, they have reasons which could be somewhat semi-justify their reasons to join, but they do not really have goals. Most of them, especially our beta MC Yuu, do not really have any sort of motivation, not even a decent reason to stay in the band, or at least be in the band\u2026 in their own accord. And this is the next problem I will go and bring up in this: Fuuka herself is the main issue of this series.\\n\\n\r\nTo elaborate a little bit, Fuuka specifically as a character, is probably the most despicable character I\u2019ve ever seen in a long ass while when it comes to anime. She\u2019s just a typical mary-sue character, with no actually likable treaits, no actual real motivation when it comes to the music stance, she doesn\u2019t even have a good personality as she comes off as inconsistent when it comes to her traits. In occasions she\u2019s just mean and rather bullying, but then in the other cases she\u2019s energetic and charming. The thing that did actually made me feel a bit of a piss was mostly how this was handled around Episodes 10 and 11 to point out. She pretty much had the \u201capparent\u201d issue with Mr. Truck-kun (which will I will get shortly), so she then decides to go and take more on a career as a standalone, which was nice and all and somehow a bit justified\u2026 but then the next episode it completely contradicted everything that it was done down upon, and making it more like the main reason why the band even existed, wasn\u2019t because they wanted to make a band and want to build it. The reason why the band even existed, is because Fuuka existed, so without her the group is just as shallow as water. Honestly, call me bullshitting or not, but that in itself is technically worse than most of what the Spanish Dramas have done as reasons when it comes to certain areas. If the only reason the band existed was because of her alone then I call that extremely unrealistic. Sure you can argue that without her people can go and try to build their own band again, but because that\u2019s the sole reason the characters had in the first place, this doesn\u2019t count and this type of argument in my opinion gets debunked entirely because of this situation. This just makes her as a character look more like a plot device if anything in this entire series. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention as I have stated, considering what Episode 11 has done to the series where because of Fuuka's attitude it caused the band to get disbanded, and while yes it came back afterwards (albeit that's horrible pacing as hell), it doesn't face the fact the way she acted in this situation. She was being a bitch, that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nMost of what Fuuka, and most of the characters even lack on is bonding and logic, not only those, but they also lack any sort of hard-working. The cast, especially the main two, seems to learn the songs and all as if they were professionals. It comes off as forced and unrealistic because you just do not learn how to even learn a song in a small span of time, and I'm not saying episode numbers, I mean what's in the display. Especially the biggest example is the finale: Yuu learned how to make songs... without really giving any sort of actual hints that he did practiced. And Fuuka, learned how to sing the song Yuu wrote perfectly, without having the actual living knowledge of the song itself. That's when things fall apart in the band and character aspect, they don't even feel a slight of hint of development nor hints of practice, it comes off out of nowhere without really showing anything. Which is fucking terrible.\\n\\n\r\nMy next issue which is something I\u2019m not too familiar with the manga, but this has been apparent anyways: Deviation of the Original Source Material. Despite me giving spoilers in the previous segment, let me go and summarize it for you: Basically, the anime was supposed to take this \u201ctwist\u201d or \u201cturning point\u201d to where the entire band and Yuu himself would learn from this, which goes to a different direction of the manga afterwards. As far as I am concerned by people, this \u201ctwist\u201d was so bad, a lot of people gave backlash towards the author of Fuuka, Seo Kouji, for making this decision for the manga source. So, in one of the articles I have read which was released a week or so (by the time this review is released), the author explains that when he made this decision, the one reason why he made the change in the manga is to obviously put Yuu in a place where he has to move on as well with building the band with the others. This doesn\u2019t sound bad as the intentions while being rather poor regardless when it came to the anime (at least cannon wise) was poorly handled anyways but the reasons would be semi-justified albeit very forced in the end from what I am getting at, I can see that working. He pretty much wanted an anime where \u201cFuuka lives\u201d so to say, so in that case the reason why he did that was to pretty much give some of the fans that likes that character a \u201chappy ending\u201d so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn\u2019t sound bad on paper if he wants to make the said character stay alive, but then let me ask you this question. If the intention of said changes of the original source material was to have her have a happy ending: \\n\\n\r\nWhy did you pretty much made Fuuka as a character, especially the episode 11, so dislikable beyond belief? If you wanted to at the very least make her have a happy ending, you shouldn\u2019t have her act this way in the first place, and the reason why is because nobody, including myself, will not buy this decision as it doesn\u2019t really let me and anyone support her, in fact it goes for the opposite direction of what it could be intended.\\n\\n\r\nWhy did you pretty much teased the relationship or forcing development between Koyuki and Yuu, only to then throw that development as pointless? Instead of giving Koyuki screentime and development towards Yuu to build up the relationship, you could easily at least give the suggestion to the staff to focus more on Fuuka as a character with her relationship with Yuu, especially since in the anime they don\u2019t have any sort of romantic chemistry or hinting whatsoever. It comes off as forced and unrealistic as hell. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe it can\u2019t be the mangaka\u2019s fault, but either way someone should have thought of this before making this desperate and failure attempt at writing romance and development, since it doesn\u2019t come off as good as it looked on paper. It just falls apart like papers.\\n\\n\r\nThe other issue that I find with this series is the Visual Presentation and how the art looks. To pretty much give you a bit of a background, this is pretty much produced by Diomedea which was a studio that at the very least for me, had 2 good winning streaks in terms of the shows from last year. Being Handa-kun and Girlish Number, two shows while not being extremely amazing, those had decent to good characters, they have either decent to good stories and way they were executed, and how they worked with the comedy. I know comparing a comedy and a drama would be a bit of a stretch but getting to the point: Those two's strengths had good or decent visuals. Handa-kun is probably decent looking albeit some of the animation can be alright and bland, while Girlish Number while it dipped down in terms of the art later on it was still looking a bit consistent. \\n\\n\r\nFuuka's case? None. The art is just mostly bland and very not appealing, the direction is just atrocious when it comes to that as well as everything feels for the most part rather static, animation is mediocre at best for the most part with the exception of few scenarios where it looked decent, as well as the ways the characters looked, although they stayed at least stayed true to the source material from what I can gather, for some reason the way it looks is just... meh. Just, mediocre all the way imaginable. Not interesting, not pretty, nor at least handling on its own. Overall this is one of the few saving graces with the show.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the problem with this show which is the most obvious one to look at: Poor Direction. Basically, the show doesn\u2019t know what it wants to be when it comes to the genres, the staff do not really know how to even handle these and making these work, or maybe they don\u2019t know how to make what Seo suggested or anything of the sorts. The point is, the show falls off as pretty terrible directed due to the fact that the transitions, visual presentation, the way it was handling its own themes and structure, its own clich\u00e9s and genres at the worst way possible, and in the not only most predictable way, but in the most insulting way as possible too. I know people from my end that felt like this show insults them, and one of my friends is an avid musician for nearly 10 years, so in some sense when a show fails to do what the person likes from the genre or poorly handles its own themes and execution, it\u2019s a bigger problem. The reason why it is a problem is because this show might be the worst to represent the genre. It\u2019s bland, it\u2019s executed poorly, it\u2019s uninteresting, it\u2019s forced and contrived, messy writing to the core. Honestly, I can\u2019t really blame anyone for this series at the very least. I can understand why they feel this way, and that\u2019s totally fine. I believe this show fails in almost everything in the regard to this, exception of the music which is actually the only redeeming factor of the show alone, albeit not impressive, it\u2019s not that great either. The EDs are probably the highlights of the show as well as the inserts. Other than that, nothing too much about the show.\\n\\n\r\nFuuka could be a pretty decent show in the end, it could be somewhat decent with at least doing some twinkies to go and fix the problems, possibly the manga could have wanted. But the problem comes that all of these, from its execution from both writing, original content, characters, drama, thematic structure, etc. Comes off as so bullshit, that there\u2019s nearly no redeeming qualities in this series at all. You pretty much have a show that is essentially \u201cHow to not Write a Drama Series\u201d in a nutshell, and this is coming from someone that has a inconsistent liking for shows as you would be aware. I do not Recommend Fuuka to anyone over here if you are going to go and check it out, please just go and save yourself from this mess story and a sad excuse of a \"drama\".",

The mediocre meter measured a change of 0.43, in other words, the ending and the last minute changes destroyed the animation. It is boring and mediocre. We want to block it in our memory next to Bing Bong. Usually, a series will rise in the last chapters, but Fuuka is one exception let me correct that, 2017 winter season deception. \r\nNo matter if you follow the manga or not, you will feel that they took the wrong direction. We can't call the anime an adaptation because it is a sidestory. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation had potential, but the developments killed any chance of seeing a good narrative. The pacing is horrible. The characters aren't well developed. In this fantastic world, you can be a musician using the 24 hours magical training, and you will get a studio record contract after playing a school fair and a single club concert guaranteed, no hard training needed. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are different in the manga. For example, imagine Vegeta. In the manga, he is arrogant, self- entitled and ruthless, but now we take him into the animation and change him as the lover of all the living creatures. It is like seeing a dog eating cat food and meowing.\\n\\n\r\nYou can't explain why they focus several episodes on some characters if they were planning to trash them. The drama is forced. The romance is weird, from nowhere the characters start loving each other. Their actions and decisions lack background because the story isn't well developed. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a big crater in the story, details that you can't explain or aren't needed for the new thing. Even if they wanted to change the story from the manga, they shouldn't tease the watchers with details from the manga (street lights). There were better solutions than this aberration, and we could have enjoyed it more. \\n\\n\r\nBut not everything is bad. There are some cameos with Suzuka if you are a follower of that story. The art is fine, and the music is good. I am wondering if the main idea of the adaptation was selling the songs because selling the episodes is going to be a pain. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, if you want to spend some fun time, perhaps you should pick other animation, you could feel disappointed after watching this. My score is 5.0, I saw Suzuka, but I wanted to see this animated in a different way. All these decisions killed any opportunity for a second season\\n\\n\r\nNow let's give this adaptation some awards (for more info read my profile). I will give this the Picard's Facepalm Award; the School Days give me other ending Award and the Sakura Haruno Character Award.",

            "content": "So I saw that this anime had a not of negative reviews, but life's too short to hate things, so I decided to make this review to touch on the parts that I found great and where it could have done better.\r\nFirst of All, this anime is a music/romance anime, at first I thought it was a weird combination, but i felt like it actually worked really well. It's also a music anime which you don't need to be ashamed of if any of your parents catch you watching it (No stages full of girls doing cringy cut/paste dancing in horrible fps). So the animestarts off weird, i personally did not enjoy the first episode as much as the others as i felt like the meeting of the characters was completely unnatural and felt a little forced. Regardless, the characters develop a friendship in the first episode despite their rocky beginnings. The more episodes I watched, the more I actually enjoyed. \\n\r\nFuuka is a sweet, adorable girl with a passion for music, and is incredibly friendly, and cares deeply about her friends. She is shy, and unexperienced with love, and likewise with Yuu, so their characters are quite cute as they eventually develop feelings for one another despite Yuu and Fuuka have a slight speedbump in their relationship, allowing for them to discover what the other means to them.\\n\r\nOn to the music side of things, the sense of time in this anime is a little weird being honest, like at times it skips days,weeks, months which i personally feel works with this anime, as it saves having montages of characters developing their skills. The anime did make it seem like learning an instrument and making a song is childs play, which we all know for a fact that its quite the opposite. The first song the band learns is Climbers high by a band in the anime called Hedgehogs (whom also play a vital role in the development of the music),  and the song was played at the schools culture festival which had a shaking start, but as the band began playing, the crowd warmed up to them and it was a great success. I have no clue why, but when the band was playing and having a great time, I was always getting goosebumps while watching it, i guess I was so happy for everyone. \\n\r\nAnyways, im sick of writing a review so imma just say again that lifes too short to hate things, watch an anime and look for the things you enjoyed about it, and not the things you didnt.",

My reaction after finishing its (currently) 9 dreadful episodes is one of repulsion, disgust, and pure anger. This anime does everything wrong and then some, but let's start with the basics.\r\nThe story is stupid and unfocused. The drama is some of the most forced I've seen in my life. The characters are unnatural and borderline retarded for the sake of petty drama.\r\nThe music section of the show is no better.Yuu Haruna Twitter Man plays the D Chord and a C comes out, and that's all you need to know about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is terrible and lazy, plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nI'm opposed to anything with an Ecchi tag, and this anime is the reason why. I bet all the sexually repressed 12-year olds were fucking loving the bathing scenes. Congratulations to them, I hope your hormones were properly activated.\\n\\n\r\nFUCK Fukka. I'll probably be unironically writing a fanfiction where Yuu Haruna dies a slow, painful death\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: After the first 9 episodes, Fuuka stops being a forced, unbearable trainwreck and becomes obnoxiously generic instead. This apparently coincides with the point where they deviated from the source work, which is telling. I'm a sucker for romances and good endings though, so the score goes up to a 2. It's almost sad, really. It could've been the perfect example of a godawful show, but I'm glad they at least tried to make it good in the end.",

            "content": "\u2666Why I think 'Fuuka' deserves a better rating \u2666 |||NO SPOILERS|||\r\nNot that I'm an otaku but I have been watching a lot of animes. Personally, my favourite are animes about magic (lots of fantasy basicly) so any other must really try hard to get my attention.\r\nWhat drew my attention was the energy of the main character Fuuka, I tend to be alike a little (hehe). So it kind of swept me on board this anime and I continued watching. Whether you believe me or not, I really thought it would end different. You know what I mean I don't have to spoiler. But the factthat it didn't, maybe I liked that even more. It was more honest this way, no matter how hard the truth can be.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the pace of the anime, from time to time you hear them say 'it's been x weeks' so you know time is really passing by fast and you're only seeing the important parts. (Like you know, even in soap series you don't see everything like every toilet visit for instance.) They could have made this a 24 episodes anime but I like it better this way, it showed us what it wanted to show and no unnecessarily information to fill it up. \\n\\n\r\nThe art work is also great, I just can't stand to watch those old or bad quality animes. (sorry) Art work is really important for me because it brings the emotions out better.\\n\\n\r\nSound was great, I love how we actually heard their songs. (instead of skipping that part because of expenses) But also their practices and everything in between. \\n\\n\r\nIt bothered me a little how long it took them to realize who was in love with who. But I guess even if that wasn't the problem, it's still not easy. Being in love that is. But besides that, there were also characters who seemed to know exactly what was going on and I wish them the best. \u2665\u263a \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really liked this anime ( I didn't cry!... I didn't!!)\\n\\n\r\nSo I'd definitely recommend it!",

            "content": "There\u2019s a type of show that has been showing up more and more in recent seasons, whether we as critics and reviewers like it or not. These are the shows whose success relies completely on how much the viewer likes a single character, with all of the show\u2019s potential wasted on making this character as interesting and appealing as possible. Unfortunately, the result is, more often than not, a show with a cast of boring cardboard cutouts overshadowed by a single interesting character whose personality is a horrible Frankenstein\u2019s monster of character traits that, despite not meshing, the show\u2019s creators desperately hope will appeal tomany fans.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cFuuka,\u201d Diomedia\u2019s latest production, is one such show.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame, honestly. Diomedia\u2019s previous work, \u201cGi(a)rlish Number,\u201d was thoroughly enjoyable due to its wide and well-developed cast of characters. Each character in \u201cGi(a)rlish Number\u201d exhibited a specific set of character traits that could be identified and explained easily, character traits which managed to bounce off of each other and create legitimately interesting interactions. It came as a surprise, of course, to me when I was told by a friend that \u201cFuuka\u201d was quite the opposite.\\n\\n\r\n\tCHARACTERS - 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said before, the entire show is carried by a single character - Fuuka Akitsuki. As this is an ecchi romance, what ultimately decides Fuuka's success as a character is how appealing she is to the viewer. Her character hits on some of the right notes - She's very cute, for one, and certainly stands out in a crowd, given her pretty design and unique style of dressing. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Fuuka only stands out visually. Personality-wise, it's very difficult to figure out what kind of person she actually is. One moment she's acting defensive and violent, and the next she is acting clingy and romantic. Fuuka seemingly has trouble understanding what other characters are thinking, as well. At one point she catches the protagonist with a childhood friend and immediately jumps to the conclusion that this friend is the protagonist's girlfriend. After she runs away, the protagonist tries to talk to her, but she gives him the silent treatment until eventually punching him and saying \"baka\" in a very generic tsundere voice. Now, it's only natural to have mood swings, and, for some characters, mood swings can become a very entertaining plot point. But Fuuka's mood swings are little more than an annoyance, and are especially jarring due to their stark contrast against the two-dimensionality of the rest of the cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a run-of-the-mill, obnoxiously dense high-schooler, someone who can't help but get into perverted situations and then not understand what's going on. Usually, I can tolerate annoying characters as long as their annoying traits either make sense within the context of the narrative or advance the plot. However, this isn't true for our protagonist. When faced with a difficult task such as playing the bass for a rock band, he has the typical shounen-protagonist response of telling himself that he'll \"do his best.\" I mentioned previously how Fuuka reacts to his being with this childhood friend. Well, he barely attempts to explain to Fuuka what's actually going on. The two main characters are so infuriatingly unable to understand what's happening that their misunderstandings drive the entire plot. If there's a better definition of \"contrivance,\" I'm not aware that it exists.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they're also pretty cookie-cutter. There's a gay guy whose entire personality is defined by his homosexuality, a controlling idol who would probably be one of my favorite characters if we actually learned more about her motivation and her reasons for existing other than providing forced tension between Fuuka and our protagonist, and a legion of sisters who always seem to be naked when our protagonist comes home for no purpose other than fanservice. There's not much else to say here.\\n\\n\r\n\tVISUALS - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDiomedia has impressed me pretty consistently with their visual style. The characters are drawn with realistic proportions (with the exception of breasts, but it's an ecchi show - they're supposed to be large and attractive) and pretty eyes, and there is solid animation of hair blowing in the wind and of ocean waves crashing. Diomedia's style is characterized by the fact that the lines bordering objects are not black but are instead darker tones of said object's color. This gives the art a very vibrant, fun-to-look-at feel. During the opening sequence, the lines are traditional colors, with the shadows darker than usual in a sort of comic-book style. This is also nice, because it not only sets the opening sequence apart from the rest of the anime, but it gives the feeling of an exciting rock concert.\\n\\n\r\n\tSOUND - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's a show about music. Of course the music is going to be good. The opening theme is performed well, and the female vocalist is especially talented. It reminds me of the ending theme from \"Mob Psycho 100,\" which is one of my personal favorites. \\n\\n\r\nMy one complaint is that, although the song is good, we hear it multiple times in every episode. If something is going to be a shows opening, it's reasonable to assume that we'll hear it at the start of every episode, at the end of the finale, and perhaps one or two times during exciting scenes near the end of the series. However, whenever the band is playing, they play the OP. Once again, the song is good, but it gets old very quickly when you hear it as often as you do. \\n\\n\r\n\tSTORY - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't mean to sound crude, but the story feels like an eighth-grader's goofy sexual fantasy. The contrivances in the plot are absolutely hilarious, creating a perfect storyline for the protagonist that not only gets him into multiple perverted situations with Fuuka but that gets him making out with her not long after they've met. It's completely and totally unrealistic to think that the girl who accuses you of taking photos of her panties would ask you out within the day. It's equally unrealistic to think that she'd let you stare at her ass without noticing what was going on only a few short days later. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a subplot about a rock band which is, unfortunately, thoroughly unoriginal. It feels as though the band was simply thrown in for the sake of giving the story more substance, but the idea of joining a high-school band has been done many times, to a much better effect (May I suggest \"K-On!\"?). More coincidences are left for the viewer to simply accept - The band is missing a bassist and a vocalist, and it just HAPPENS to be Fuuka and the protagonist's favorite band, and these two just HAPPEN to be capable of playing the missing instrument and singing (Speaking of singing, the way that they establish Fuuka's talent is also painfully silly - She and the protagonist are walking home and she suddenly opens her mouth and belts out a really loud, really low song that most likely wakes up half of the people in town who are trying to sleep).\\n\\n\r\nI have a small amount of knowledge of the manga, so I know where the story is going. Without spoiling anything, I must say that the impending plot twist will certainly distinguish Fuuka from other ecchi romance shows. However, the effectiveness of the plot twist will, of course, depend on how much the viewer likes Fuuka herself. If the viewer doesn't feel any emotional attachment to her, the plot twist will likely feel like another contrivance, and will be another unintentionally funny moment. My friend who dropped this show burst out laughing and vowed to watch the rest when I alerted him to this twist.\\n\\n\r\n\tENJOYMENT - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm not too impressed by the show. Having not read the manga, I don't know what direction the series will take after this nebulous plot twist hits, but I doubt that it will totally save the show. As of right now, I don't like Fuuka's character, and I can't see that changing before the end of the series. Of course, the art is still great and the music is enjoyable. I've always liked to see shows about bands and musicians. And I won't lie - I do enjoy the fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, for a show that I started watching on a whim because a friend said it was \"aggressively average,\" I do think I'll keep watching because I'm interested in what direction it might take in the future. If nothing else, it will provide me with a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found this review helpful.\\n",

Luckily, I didn't watch it all and end up hating it so I'll be one of the few so far to give it a higher score.\r\nThe story follows Fuuka and how she came to meet Yuu Haruna.  They end gathering a few other students and they form a band together.  There's romantic stuff thrown into the mix and it ends up just being an enjoyable show as you watch the characters get more attached to each other. \r\nThe art is vibrant and colorful like itshould be for a show based around music.  I really like the character designs and outfits too.  The outfits actually kind of help you tell what the characters main type of role is in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was really good.  The slower music scores worked well for the romantic scenes and drama scenes, while the more upbeat lyrics worked well for their concerts/performances, and happy moments.  Both types of sound tied very nicely together.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are kind of lacking though.  I don't hate any of them, but not all of them are memorable.  At least, the main characters get development.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this each week.  It is something different and all the elements came to together to make it a really enjoyable experience.",

            "content": "Anime original adaptations have always been a heavily debated subject within the anime community.\r\nIn some cases it has resulted in a far superior product than its source material, like with Usagi Drop.\r\nIn other cases it has downright split the franchise's fan base in half, like with Fullmetal Alchemist 2003.\r\nAnd yet in other cases still it has been widely considered to have been a simply terrible decision, like with Akame ga Kill.\r\nWhatever your stance on those particular series may be, I think most of us can at least agree on the fact that going heavily anime original instead of faithfully following the source material is veryhit-or-miss. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it does not. And in Fuuka's case, I am honestly not sure what to think of it, because its original elements ended up turning an already mediocre manga into an equally mediocre anime... but for totally different reasons.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into this though, I would just like to mention that Fuuka is actually a next generation sequel to an older series called Suzuka. To get straight to the point, no you do *not* need to watch/read it before watching this anime as they are wholly separate stories. All you really need to know is that the protagonist and main heroine of Suzuka are Fuuka's parents, and that they are both national level athletes. That aside Suzuka is a ten times better romance manga than Fuuka has ever been so I would still definitely recommend it if you have the time (never watched its anime though but as far as I know it was a very incomplete adaptation so you are probably better off with the manga).\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, Fuuka is to a large extent a rather old school and clich\u00e9 romance drama. We begin with the fairly reserved and introverted protagonist Haruna Yuu who prefers to spend his spare time on Twitter over hanging out with friends, who one day moves to a new town. There he runs into a strange yet energetic girl with blue hair called Akatsuki Fuuka; a girl running around wearing a pair of headphones and listening to an old CD-player instead of using a phone. Some misunderstandings ensue, but the two of them eventually sort things out, and in the process end up befriending each other. And so begins the spark of a potential romance in the making. Fuuka is someone living with an uncertain future. Because of her parents she is largely expected to become a professional athlete as well, but that is not something she wants to become. Instead, she spends a lot of time outside hanging out with Yuu in order to try to find what she really wants to do in life. And eventually, the answer she arrives at with Yuu's help, is music, which alongside romance is the central theme of the story as the two of them set out to start a band together with their friends from school.\\n\\n\r\nIt all sounds simple enough, but unfortunately, there are some serious problems with Fuuka as an anime. First and foremost, the drama is incredibly forced and unnatural more often than not. Numerous times we have girls just so happening to show up at *just* the right/wrong moment in order to catch Yuu in some interaction with another girl, leading to misunderstanding upon misunderstanding which the story then has to go about an episode or two sorting out only to return to the status quo again. There is even a scene in the first episode where Yuu and Fuuka are supposed to meet up in town and end up missing each other for a ridiculously long time just because they were standing on opposite sides of a statue at their decided meeting location. I mean seriously? Just how stupid is that? Or how about how she just casually breaks his phone in the opening scene of the show just because he (completely unintentionally) caught a glimpse of her panties? I mean people... would not normally do that, not to mention how Yuu actually reacts to the situation as if it somehow *is* normal. The story has a tendency of generating its continuity through quite simply retarded character behavior which in turn results in drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem is the characters themselves. While Fuuka is an all-round likable girl with her cheerful and constantly energetic personality, she, just like everyone else in the show, has a tendency to sometimes act incredibly abnormal just for sake of drama as mentioned previously. But you also have to ask just why she would fall in love with Yuu to begin with? Sure, he helped her find a new passion in music by starting a band together, but beyond that Yuu is kind of a doormat. He is cautious and anti-social in nature and generally just follows along wherever Fuuka drags him along, and just feels incredibly bland and uninteresting in general. And do not even get me started on the other band members, they are so forgettable and have so little character development that their sole purpose in the show is effectively to be Yuu's and Fuuka's sidekicks by providing instrumental support. The final character of note is Hinashi Koyuki: an old childhood friend of Yuu who has now become a popular idol. She creates what is a rather unnecessary love triangle by frequently trying to get in-between Fuuka and Yuu, which not only causes drama in-between them but also on a larger scale when her idol otaku fans find out about her feelings after some pictures end up being leaked on the internet. And now we are really getting into the epitome of ridiculous character behavior by seeing how aggressively and violently some of her fans react to the news. Granted I am well aware that there are in fact some really crazy idol fans out there in the real world too, but still come on.\\n\\n\r\nThe third and final major issue with Fuuka is the anime original content. This is fairly difficult to talk about without spoiling anything, but basically everything from the middle of episode eight and onwards is all anime original. Now, the manga is quite infamous for having one of the most wtf plot twists ever a couple of volumes in which completely alters the story for all future, and not in a good way. This also happens to be one of the worst kept secrets in the anime community though so if you have somehow avoided being spoiled on this then... congratulations. As stupid as this development was though, it was at least quite unique, and really it is without a doubt the most memorable part of the entire manga. So when the anime then decided to not even adapt this at all and instead to go off do something different altogether, I was left with some rather mixed feelings. Sure, if the original version is bad to begin with then doing something else in the anime is not a bad idea on paper, but replacing it with something equally mediocre is not really an improvement. The manga's version was at least unorthodox and unexpected even if it was dumb, but the anime's version is bad *and* generic on top of it. I do not know about you, but personally I would rather take the former. Furthermore, the reason the manga's development is bad is not because of the twist itself (that was actually kind of cool I thought), but rather that the author seemingly ran out of steam completely because ever since it happened, there has been absolutely nothing good happening in it, and that is now over 100 chapters ago... which is kind of inexcusable. However, since the anime would not have covered very far beyond the twist with merely 12 episodes anyway, that would not really have been a problem so why not just adapt it faithfully for as long as the timespan allows and then stop? That would have made sense to me. At the very least it should have been better than the manga if so, but now... I am not so sure. Because instead, we are left with a bunch of additional forced drama between Yuu, Fuuka and Koyuki for our anime original ending, with a heavily increased emphasis on the latter compared to the manga. And while I guess we at least got a sort of conclusive ending for anime-only viewers this way, it still felt very underwhelming in the end.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to an interview with the anime staff and the original mangaka uploaded to Animenewsnetwork on March 17th, Seo Kouji said that while he had never regretted taking the manga in the peculiar direction he did, he had always been thinking about the what-if scenario where had decided not to, and thus said that if Fuuka was finally getting an anime adaptation he would like to take the chance to showcase this what-if scenario in the anime instead, and apparently the anime's producer thought the same. I guess that is a simple and understandable reason, but it also feels more like self-satisfaction than trying to come up with the best final product anime-wise to me. Also, if he really felt that way, was there any reason to throw in all these subtle teasers about the twist throughout the anime only to then never adapt it anyway? It literally feels like nothing but an attempt at trolling and baiting those anime viewers who had already read the manga, which would be rather unprofessional if so.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is anything positive to mention about this anime though, it would definitely be the music. Of course this might be expected to go hand-in-hand with being an actual music anime, but either way the live performances in Fuuka are actually pretty awesome. Especially the first half of episode eight (right before the original content starts) was really enjoyable to listen to, and by far the best scene of the anime. Granted, this naturally depends on your taste in music as well, but at the very least I think the band performances were really well-made when they actually gave it their all (though it would have been nice if there was a greater song repertoire used throughout the anime). And that is one thing which was most certainly a hell of a lot better than in the manga; there are few things more awkward than reading about a supposedly awesome concert when all you are hearing is the deafening sound of complete and utter silence set to still imagery.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, the main problems with Fuuka stem from the manga being mediocre to begin with rather than it being anyone at Diomedea's fault, and while the decision to go anime original is questionable and in my mind probably wrong, I can still somewhat understand it, and relatively speaking it still resulted in a final product which is not necessarily too much worse than its source material (which admittedly does not say very much). The music elements of the show also come across a lot better in anime format due to actual presence of audio this time, so overall I would still say this was an okay-ish adaptation relative to the manga all things considered. Unfortunately, that still does not make it a very good anime in this case.",

            "content": "Fuuka's main character is the epitome of patience, forgiveness, and all around charity. We can observe some of this overflowing generosity in even the very first episode. Now our main protagonist here is a shining example of peace, perhaps comparable to Martin Luther King Junior or Ghandi, but that wouldn't be very humble or modest, now would it? See, I myself am not a very patient or forgiving person, I'll admit. I'll sometimes be hateful and rude to other who may not deserve that hate. After watching Fuuka, I've realized the error of my ways and now strive to become just like the main character.Well what makes this main character so great, you ask? \\n\\n\r\nListen carefully now. In the very first episode we can begin to see the shining purity of the main character. Within just two days, he gets his all important phone broken twice by the same woman. Normally, I would have been infuriated by this woman's actions, bubbling with rage. But does out protagonist falter? No, he calmly just pays up several hundred dollars without protest. But the story of our protagonist's charity does not end here, no no. See, the woman who broke his phone both times did not ever compensate or apologize in the slightest for her actions, but luckily for her, our shining hero is a kind and patient man. Because he was such a gentleman, he took the lady out on a date to her favorite movie! How wonderful and kind!\\n\\n\r\nSee, we could all learn from this man's example- all of us; no matter who you are, whether it be the president of the United States or a young businessman. If your house has been robbed of tens of thousands of dollars worth of cash and property, don't take the hasty action of calling the police; instead, track down the thief yourself, apologize for not having more valuable items for him/her to take, and calmly offer to instead give your house to him/her as compensation.",

            "content": "What makes a good character? In my opinion, the most essential thing of all is a relatable personality. Otherwise, the audience won\u2019t be able to sympathise with the character at all. This is why people are criticising Kirito from Sword Art Online for being too overpowered; while at the same time praising Saitama from One Punch Man even though he\u2019s litteraly one of the most overpowered characters in all of fiction including the bible. What makes us care about him is his altruism and normal life style. He\u2019s depicted as a normal dude who just happens to be a godlike figure, whereas Kirito is depictedas a godlike figure who just happens to be a normal dude.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also why the characters in Fuuka never succeeds in making me give two shits about them. From the get go we are presented with a main character whose actions are as logical as a flat Earth painted by Dali. Not only does he decide to hang out with the psycho who just smashed his phone into a million pieces, but he also decides not to mention the fact that the very famous singer said psycho loves is an old childhood friend of his; something he doesn\u2019t tell her until episode four, after they\u2019ve gone to her concert together. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where we as an audience gets pulled out of the immersion of the show. Because just like a magic trick isn\u2019t as effective if we\u2019re able to see the card hidden in the sleeve, a show loses its credibility if the audience are able to see the hand of the director. In this case it\u2019s painfully obvious that the only reason why the main character acts as he does, is to create drama later on. In other words, the show sacrifices its inner logic in favor of a spicy story.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the whole show is a little bit too convenient. The main character just happens to be a childhood friend of Fuuka\u2019s favorite singer. Their teacher just happens to be a member of Fuuka\u2019s favorite band. The person Yuu tweets with just happens to be sitting in front of him. The list goes on. And when you have so many examples of coincidences stacked on top of each other, it becomes impossible to relate to anything that happens just because it\u2019s so unbelievable.\\n\\n\r\nThe shallow characters combined with the bad story structure results in a big ol\u2019 mess. The show never seems to figure out what it wants to be, and by the time you reach the end you get a feeling of what was the point? The only real charachter development in the whole show is that Yuu learns how to play the bass on a professional level in the span of what feels like a few weeks, that\u2019s it. In the end, Fuuka expects you to relate to unrelatable characters and believe an unbelievable story. And not to mention, it\u2019s pretty &#@% boring.\\n",

            "content": "I believe that anime like Fuuka are a breed apart from the usual slice of life anime that we've been struck with as of late. \r\nYou guys all know what I'm talking about; those anime that show great promise initially but then taper off into bitter disappointment or worse boredom. \r\nFuuka manages to break the barrier set by these mediocre anime in several regards. \r\nI will be the first to admit that its story is nothing original but neither is it terrible and that's exactly what you want in a slice of life. The art style is great to look at and the soundboard ofthe series is better than many others I have heard (although I have found slice of lifers to have generally fantastic music). \\n\\n\r\nWhere this series shines though is in its characters and its progression of the story. Rare is the anime these days where you feel that there is actual progression of the story with each episode. While the main character is nothing too special the heroine possesses a kind of bubbly charm unique to her character which really stands out, particularly as this is a romance anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like the most is that there is a clear progression of the relationship between the two leads and it is neither at a snails pace nor breakneck quick in its development. \\n\\n\r\n5 episodes in and I am decently confident that in this anime we might actually be left off with a confirmed relationship rather than the \"friends but not friends\" endings we get with most \"romance\" anime.",

It's fine if an anime has a bit of ecchi in it, but please, please make it bearable to watch. \r\n  Another thing that completley ruined this anime was the childhood friend. You knew she'd never win thelove triangle based on the main charecter's stupidity! He can't even realise when a girl is in love with him! Plus, who would fall for a bland, dull guy like that? It's just not realistic!\\n\r\n  Fuuka is not even a good charecter. We don't seen enough backstory to this charecter to even like her  or not.

The biggest example here is the songs playd by the band, which don't sound at all like they are being played live OR by a group of amateurs.\r\n2: Awful pacing. Everything is just so very slow, with a lot of lingering unanimated shots. The whole story could be better conveyed with 12 10-minute episodes. I'd be willing to bet it would be a more enjoyable experience.\r\n3: A lot of unnecessary scenes, like the truck scene from episode 10. I'm pretty sure theycould have found a better way to do what that scene needed to do, so that it didn't have to feel so jarring.\\n\\n\r\n4: Stupid, unfunny jokes based around a certain character's sexuality.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing the series tried to do, and managed to pull it off, even if it was not as good as one might wish:\\n\\n\r\nThere was some character development, enough for there to be a feeling that the story was evolving and going somewhere. The stakes for each character were well-defined, but the show felt the need to shove scene upon scene on the viewer's face to get them across, which led to many a boring scene. The show could really benefit from more subtlelty.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: to anyone who hates clich\u00e9s, this anime is certainly not for you.

            "content": "My opinion: \r\nClichefest merged with shitfest. \r\nFor most of the duration of this show I was in a self-induced comatose state as a defense mechanism against the utter stupidity of the show.\r\nFuuka is one of the most forced drama series I have ever seen and it was a painfully generic and cliched show to watch. Fuuka is one of the worst excuses for media-entertainment that I've ever seen and this is no exaggeration. My reaction after finishing its 12 dreadful episodes is one of repulsion, disgust, and pure anger. \r\nStory: 2/10\r\nI do not seek to offend anyone but this show\u2019s plot seems to be writtenin the image of a teenager\u2019s sexual fantasies, following a juvenile course that I often found irritating.\\n\r\nThe story revolves around the unusual girl, Fuuka, and a new shy transfer student, Yuu Haruna and the popular singer Koyuki Hinashi. This plot is not just utterly generic but also filled with holes, conveniences, cringe worthy lines, it is cliched to the point that cliches form a large part of the story, it is poorly paced and poorly constructed with a poor execution.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of this show I had the feeling it was going to be bad, very bad. \\n\r\nIn the first few minutes we see a forced and cliche scene where Fuuka runs into Yuu and both of them end up in an awkward and embarrassing situation where Yuu is accused of taking pictures of Fuuka\u2019s underwear. Next thing we see is Fuuka smashing Yuu\u2019s phone and then running off, where the f is she running to?... Never mind that, the following day Fuuka invites Yuu, who she a few days before accused of being a complete pervert, to a very requested concert\u2026 getting past the imbecilic story-line, where does Fuuka get her money from to be able to throw around front-row tickets to a popular concert. From here on, Yuu and Fuuka will grow closer through numerous plot conveniences and cliche scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many unbelievable coincidences and imbecilic actions to the point you lose track of their number, they just keep coming, being shot at the show with a machine gun. \\n\r\nFor instance, we have members from the famous band \u201cHedgehogs\u201d being school staff (what\u2019s the chance of that?) but huge Hedgehogs fans can't recognize a single member from their favorite band. The protagonists just end up working over the summer with a member of that same famous band as their boss; the girl that ran into the male lead turns out to be in his class, etc. \\n\r\nIn one episode, far from the beach, Yuu almost drowns trying to save Fuuka from drowning and then he is showed on the beach being resuscitated by Fuuka, through the mouth-to-mouth method (cliche). How the heck did Fuuka mannage to carry the unconscious Yuu back to the beach before he died? \\n\r\nThat\u2019s a shitload of hard to believe coincidences and actions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor a music show this is very poorly done. Apparently it is very easy to play musical instruments, you just need to be briefly told how to do it, no practice needed and you just need to be a random girl who sings in the shower in order to be a good cover artist and vocalist. \\n\r\nThis show is offensive to real artists and the work they put in\u2026 these few students start playing a song without knowing the notes or the song itself, their instruments or even which instrument they would like to play and succeed in playing that song. Planning to create a new song? Fuuka will compose it in two days. Oh, just give me a break!\\n\r\n\"Here, Yuu-kun, you'll play bass while we see if Fuuka's got talent because reasons!\" - just another imbecilic course of action.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama is made up of plot conveniences that are thrown together forming a complete mess and not only that but it is one of the most forced and cliche I have ever seen. We have the generic \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d between characters that stretch out over 1-3 episodes only to be solved with two words, poorly done drama.\\n\r\nOf course, we have a cliche love triangle made up by Fuuka, Yuu and the childhood friend, Koyuki. This drama failed before it began, I already knew Koyuki will lose based on her shallow and dull personality, not only did the love triangle drama fail but it failed miserably.\\n\\n\r\nNext on the list: Ecchi scenes. The ecchi scenes are so forced that they insult my intelligence. \\n\r\nHow the hell does Yuu pulling his jacket off Fuuka result in Fuuka with her arms out of the jacket and up, her shirt pulled halfway up her chest and his hand under her shirt? \\n\r\nJackets do not work that way, falling does not work that way. There is no way this \u201caccident\u201d could happen. You can't accidentally turn away from somebody wearing the same jacket, accidentally pull them underneath you and then also accidentally pull up their shirt and fondle their tits.\\n\r\nThis is levels beyond the dumb anime logic I am used to, it makes an art out of being an idiotic show. I can suspend disbelief but now you are asking the impossible! And what the fck is up with the \u201csisters\u201d that are always half-naked?\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is predictable and all the twists are predictable, once a character is introduced you already know how it will end up, removing any potential tension that may intrigue the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nThe characters are generic, cliche, one-dimensional (absolutely no development), poorly built and ultimately hollow having no real personality. These characters live in the bullshit land too.\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist, Yuu Haruna is a generic run-of-the-mill, dense high-schooler who keeps getting into perverted and embarrassing situations over and over again and later not understand what's going on.\\n\r\nHe is also unable to properly share his thoughts with other characters, especially Fuuka, therefore creating cheap drama and a state of confusion. \\n\r\nWhen faced with an obstacle he adopts the generic \u201cI\u2019ll do my best\u201d mentality and through plot convenience he will achieve his goal.\\n\r\nIn the very first episode we can see the excellent patience and kindness of the main character. Within just two days,Yuu gets his precious phone broken twice by the same woman. Normally, I would have been infuriated by this woman's actions, oozing with rage. But does our protagonist falter? No, he calmly just pays up several hundred dollars without protest or resentment. The story of our protagonist's kindness does not end here, no, no. See, the woman who broke his phone, twice, that is two fking times, did not ever compensate or apologize in the slightest for her actions, but luckily for her, our protagonist is a kind and patient man. Because he was such a gentleman, he took the lady out on a date to her favorite movie! How wonderful and kind!\\n\r\nEnough with the jokes, Yuu is a shit character.\\n\r\nHe is shy, kind and introverted. That\u2019s all I could get from him.\\n\\n\r\nFuuka is a difficult character to decipher because of how poorly she is constructed, one moment she acts defensive and violent and next she acts cuddly and romantic so I am left here wondering what the hell is going on with her. \\n\r\nFuuka is the generic \u201cstrange\u201d girl that stands out through her cheerful and free-willed personality, she has numerous mood swings and oftens jumps to conclusions creating even more cheap drama. \\n\r\nShe once saw Yuu with his childhood friend and jumped straight to the conclusion that this friend is Yuu\u2019s girlfriend. After she runs away (cliche), Yuu tries to talk to her and to apologize (for what exactly?) but she gives him the cold shoulder until she punches him saying \u201cbaka\u201d in a generic tsundere voice, giving me a cringe-worthy memory.\\n\r\nIs Fuuka a female Naruto? She gets everyone to be her friend and follow her lead, if it\u2019s creating a band or going to work, her friends will follow her lead.\\n\r\nShe claims to have never been in love only to later figure out she \u201cloves\u201d Yuu. Oh, give me a fking break! Can this get any more cliche?\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters have zero, I mean 0 personality or development and are utterly forgettable. \\n\r\nThere is Makoto, the blonde gay guy who says lines like \u201cI saw a really hot lifeguard, gonna go and try to land a date\u201d who\u2019s only trait is being gay, there is Nachi who is just there, and there is Sara, ah, I already forgot what she was like.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation&art for this show is good at best. It is mostly fluid but has considerable flaws with the character design of adults, they look like teenagers as well with some of the backgrounds. While the animation is mostly fluid it does have moments when it feels laggard.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nDid I see a \u201cmusic\u201d tag? This show fails in the sound department.\\n\r\nThe opening theme is atrocious, painful to listen to and the ending theme is also bad but I didn\u2019t mind it that much mostly because I didn\u2019t concern myself with skipping it. The voice actors did a decent job but not spectacular in any way. \\n\r\nIn the end, the sound was really disappointing, having bad opening/ending themes and mediocre songs as an OST.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nWhenever I wasn\u2019t completely annoyed, I laughed at the show, not at the jokes but at how bad it was and the number of ways it failed. This show is a joke, that\u2019s the only excuse I can find for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nFuuka, a show featuring a bad plot accompanied by poor characters coming in a package with mediocre animation and sound. I recommend skipping Fuuka and never looking back at it.",

Out on his way to buy dinner, he bumps into a mysterious girl, Fuuka Akitsuki, who breaks his phone thinking he was trying to take a picture of her panties. How will his new life change now?\r\nFuck.\r\nStory: 4, generic hareming it up into a light music band. Nothing original in concept. However, the plot moves a fucking mile a minute - bad anime misunderstanding that stretch out into 1-3 whole episodes in other shows get fucking slammed into 6 minutes and are done with, whether the characters really should be over them or not.\r\nArt:4, looks decent but has absurd, erroneous cinematography issues. MC's phone gets thrown in a bush so he searches the same spot in a bush for 8 seconds. A boy in a sweatshirt during episode 4 stands up in an up and to the right maneuver, which somehow results in him flipping 540 degrees, putting the sweatshirt fully back on, and grabbing a girl's midriff.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6, yeah, sounds fine, except for whenever someone gets slapped by a male and it shatters their bones and the sound barrier.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2, dear god, what? Character motivations for being into the MC stand on barely any ground or none at all. Side characters show some spirit, but a lack of human logic.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character's a bland shy baby that the girls like for no reason.\\n\r\nFuuka is an enjoyably enthusiastic character but she's insane - shatters his phone one day, asks to see the picture the next. Super sensitive about her panties for the opening plot point, but then hangs her ass in front of the MC's face in a swimsuit without any concerns at all for minutes on end (her end am I right? Ba dum chhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I'm so alone). Characters act inconsistently in this show if it'll move the plot points along.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Honestly, 10. This is where the big money is. I'm having an amazing time riffing on this hot garbage with some friends and the experiences you have in life are all you have in life before you die and pass away and it's a good chuckle fest of laughing our asses off between the inconsistent characters, inconsistent editing and logicless mise en sc\u00e8ne found in some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this if you consider yourself a pseudo-intellectual and like to riff on anime with friends. \\n\\n\r\nThis quickly written review with a few holes in it brought to you by the fact that I couldn't just paste (from the synopsis, the bare minimum effort to characterize our blank slate MC) \"Yuu Haruna just moved into town and loves to use Twitter\" and the word \"Fuck\" and call it a day.",

            "content": "Through all the shitty fanservice shows and idol/music anime airing for this season, the two categories overlapped at this show.....Only it's mostly music and barely fanservice. This was not the best.\r\n First off, this show was one of the WORST dramas I've ever seen in my life. It's so forced and the pacing of everything is terrible. Everything is forced i this show. Someone will say something then infer the exact opposite or take something personally that wasn't directed towards them.The pacing could not be any worse. One event will happen right after the other and then they'll get distracted and go on to somethingelse entirely. (Also their \"problems\" are always solved within one episode.) The \"drama\" is just a bunch of plot conveniences and a stupid love triangle that makes no sense in the first place. The love triangle consists of Yukka(I think that's his name), Fuuka, and Koyuki. Only problem is that Yukka shows in one of the very first episodes to be more committed to Fuuka, than Koyuki and he does it time and time again showing he's more committed to Fuuka. This shows that it is unnecessary to even consider Koyuki an option, But for the sake of forced drama........\\n\\n\r\nThe charaters in this show are so bland. Starting with Yukka, he is the most boring. We all know that he is a stick in the mud,and he is antisocial??? That was all I could get from him. The blonde one is basically there just to clear up any \"drama\" between Yukka and Fuuka. Finally Fuuka,she is maybe the most interesting out of all of them. She likes to sing, she jumps to a lot of conclusions, and wants to make her own decisions. Fuuka never really goes beyond her character. She stays consistent with jumping to conclusions singing, and talking about bands, or wanting to start hers.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is good at best. At times it's inconsistant and almost jarring to even look at. It's color scheme it has is very cool, to which I have to commend them for. They made it so that the colors flow smoothly but the focus is still obvious.  It's character designs are good-looking, but like had said, it's almost jarring to look at them when they gook so off model with them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I was neutral to this show it was boring to be honest and the only things keeping me hooked were the opening song and fanservice. That can only get you so far though....\\n",

Fuuka, the main character, in my eyes is a person who doesn't afraid to take risks in her life but she is also too guarded and secretive. \r\nHowever the anime has suspense and it's being a little bit rushy at the beginning which makes you wonder, what it will become at the next episode? How things will end up now? So i see it as a positive thing! \r\nThe art is magnificent and everything looks sorealistic to me! It perfectly fits with the story and some backgrounds were outstanding! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all mixed up i'll say. Like our society, they are a variety of characters that they have different personalities, weaknesses and strengths but there is always a balance in between! They are all acting so realistic which satisfies me enough to not skip the anime!\\n\\n\r\nI am really enjoying the series, my overall score (by far) it's an 8 and if i'll enjoy it even more at the end i might give it a 9! The show is good i'll gladly recommend it to those who love Music and Romance type of anime!\\n\r\n Reply       My Messages       Delete",

            "content": "A show that\u2019s mediocre at best and harmless at worst.  If you\u2019ve seen Nisekoi and about a million other romantic comedies/dramas just like Fuuka, you won\u2019t find much different here.  This is something that is such familiar territory and for most people watching they should be desensitized to it by now.  The series exudes loads of fake stakes, fake drama, fake tension and of course the most beautiful of all contrived plot threads---convenience.  Let me be clear this isn't the worst thing I've seen, not even in this season, but it is still pretty lackluster. The main problem with this showisn\u2019t that it is offensive, but that it is tired and boring.\\n\\n\r\nTruly this show is just a forgettable slog.  Even with its faults being immediately obvious, this was still a difficult review to write. It wasn't difficult because the series is so bad, but because there really is nothing to talk about. This formula has been done to death and better in shows like Toradora, School Rumble, Ranma \u00bd, Rosario + Vampire, and Tenchi Muyo, which are far more worth your time than this. Hell, calling this series unimaginative is putting it lightly.  The dialogue gets so poor to the point where much of the later dialogue consists of the words \"I'm sorry\" over and over, until they really doesn't mean much anymore. \\n\\n\r\nThe series follows a teenager by the name of Yuu-- who\u2019s only defining character is that he uses Twitter and is dense as a brick-- and his relationships with several uninteresting girls who all want to get in his pants.  The most important girl of the harem, for reasons unknown-- as she\u2019s just about as well-developed as the rest-- being Fuuka (obviously).  Oh yeah and there's a music plotline that really isn't good either as the characters have no individuality or chemistry as a band.  None of these characters are interesting or enduring in the slightest.  The story is literally driven by the same mundane plot repeating every episode with little to no differences between them, if you\u2019ve watched episode one, you\u2019ve basically watched the entire series.  The main character can never decide on which girl he likes and each of them get upset with him for half the episode only to make up with him at the end. It's extremely predictable and you'll forget most of it shortly after completing it, which for a 12 episode series that's pretty atrocious. \\n\\n\r\nFuuka is one of those series, where most veteran anime fans can look at it immediately and say, \u201cNo one gave a single shit about this\u201d. There is no subtlety or tact in the narrative, plot conveniences are thrown at you as if the creators were self-aware of how bad the writing was.  Sometimes it was hard to even tell what was going on as quite a few characters backstories are poorly explained and have no relevance.  One second a character is overacting and the next they seem totally unphased by what's going on.  If a character needs to be in a certain place, they will be there.  If the story (air-quotes) needs dragging out, it will drag.  Poor plot conveniences are bad enough, but there really isn\u2019t much story at all anyway. The entire series amounts to what can best be described as filler content. The characters much like the writing have flat, unappealing and unmemorable designs, especially the background characters that tend to be even more forgettable.  Nothing stands out about anyone and it doesn\u2019t help that the animation is that a1 pictures style of animation that is very by the books and very on model. Characters rarely move in exciting or interesting ways.\\n\\n\r\nListen I can understand why series like this are popular.  People like to project themselves onto a character, because they relate to the subject at hand.  Even if the concept is dumb or has been done a million times before, that viewer doesn\u2019t care about that. The reason so many bad series get away with being defended by so many people is because they often grab the viewer\u2019s attention when they are emotionally weak and desperately seeking this type of content.  No genres are more guilty of character projection slates than the Romance and Ecchi genres.  The reason I am disclosing this information is because honestly I think somewhere, some side of me actually wanted to enjoy this series. But I rarely go watching something with the intention to hate it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nFuuka is a clear cut example of \u201cwhat you see is, what you get\u201d.  I don\u2019t recommend this series at all.  It shouldn\u2019t be physically painful or hard to watch, but it might have you rolling your eyes a few times.  I won\u2019t lie to you there were somethings that I thought were cute and even sweet, but the lack of story, character development, conflict, interesting or expressive animation make for a product that just isn\u2019t  quality. If you weren\u2019t watching it while it aired, don\u2019t bother or waste your time, this isn\u2019t a series that\u2019ll become an undiscovered classic anytime soon.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "== Warning: This Review will Contain Spoilers to Back Up My Claims towards the Show ==\r\nNote: If I need to correct myself in some areas of this review, please let me know.\r\nAs a person that has some bias with shows, there\u2019s to some degree where I can at the very least ignore issues or glaring flaws, as long as the show delivers to what it\u2019s either promised or should give some entertainment value to it, or even if I dislike a series, I can somehow see what it did well while I ain\u2019t the biggest fan of it. That\u2019s what matters to me the mostin the first point, but in some cases, there will be shows that are so rotten and outright oblivious that it\u2019s hard to even ignore the glaring flaws of them. Fuuka, is no exception of this sentence, as the show while it doesn\u2019t have a very promising premise, it all comes down to how the execution can be played, and frankly I\u2019m the type that can at least can see execution when done right, even if some shows weren\u2019t pleasing to me at the end of the day (example Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu as one of the more apparent examples, same can go with other shows). \\n\\n\r\nFuuka can be considered as one of those series that can have the potential to be at least somewhat decent with some good development and characters, but in the end of the day when the show came to the reach of its conclusion, everything in terms of the writing and the characters, and in terms of production and direction falls apart like when you\u2019re almost done with your best masterpiece of a castle. It falls apart around everything, hence it then turns into a pile of mess. \\n\\n\r\nAnd when I talk about mess, I mean the biggest literal mess of writing I\u2019ve seen in a while, and the last time I encountered this issue to where it actually genuinely frustrates me was last year, where I did my review for Divergence Eve which was pretty much aggravating to go through and it still lingered my mind to this day. To give into perspective, execution is what matters in many series in the industry. There\u2019s no more originality unless you dig a deep hell hole, and generic or clich\u00e9s cannot be avoided no matter how much you can probably try (unless you are a master of writing then that\u2019s good for you), what matters the most for it is how these generic and clich\u00e9s are handled in the process, which is the most essential thing to do. In Fuuka\u2019s case however, that\u2019s when the pile of shit falls on. The problem mainly for Fuuka is all about the execution, from the clich\u00e9s it uses to way it handles the interactions with the band itself, where it feels like it is more frustrating than a typical Light Novel adaptation due to the show\u2019s usage of them feeling off and disconnected, not only that it personally disturbed me. And when I say compared to a stereotypical Light Novel adaptation, that\u2019s just me giving props because I feel like by that, the way these types of shows uses its own clich\u00e9s for the most part are somehow mediocre, whereas Fuuka on the hand uses it in a way where it will tick me off every second, from the misunderstandings between the characters, towards the accidental boob grab, towards the typical panty shooting misunderstanding, to the entire conflict, etc. I could go on and point these out but these are more of the issues Fuuka as a series gets, mere poor execution for its own clich\u00e9s, as well as terrible execution for the drama itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor the drama it could be described as forced (as part of the execution point), as the entire situation with the band and the characters themselves do not feel normal with the flow, thus it feels like it\u2019s trying to make the entire development feel \u201creal\u201d but in the end it feels quite weird and it takes away the immersion. For example, Yuu learning a song in a short amount of time span. I\u2019m not a musician, but I\u2019m pretty sure you cannot learn a song in that time span, especially if you are considered a newbie to this sense unless you mastered a way to learn these things quickly, this can be placed on anything in the argument. It doesn\u2019t take like that amount of time to actually learn it, it takes maybe weeks, or around months to even remember a song, especially in a band to get on the beat and get the entire tone right and running. It doesn\u2019t take that short amount of time to even get it right, realistically speaking. And from my experience, despite not being a musician it took me at least months to year in playing a song in the instrument, and it wasn\u2019t even because I was participating on something. I just did it because I enjoy playing the piano, same can go with me singing an anime Opening accurately, and it takes a while especially if the lyrics are fast. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire character interactions comes off as rather poor or not very strong considering the characters do not really share any sort of love for the music or they want to actually want to be in the band for their reasons, and it doesn\u2019t seem to showcase this either for the most part. If the characters have developed or had some sort of fitting conflict with each other, for example, and them working together on something as a way to drive into characterization as well as character development, it could mostly be beneficial towards the band and the characters alone could be decently developed. But it was never done in any sort of way.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the first few issues the shows has: Mere poor execution on the clich\u00e9s, drama, and its characters. The second main issue I wanna go and talk about is mostly the characters themselves. Most of them, with the exception of Koyuki (being the only decent character in this entire show) are downright stupid, braindead, uninteresting as rocks, bland, or just outright dislikable beyond belief. To explain what I mean, the characters do not really have any sort of personality trait in them, not even a bit. They don\u2019t really have much of a goal, they have reasons which could be somewhat semi-justify their reasons to join, but they do not really have goals. Most of them, especially our beta MC Yuu, do not really have any sort of motivation, not even a decent reason to stay in the band, or at least be in the band\u2026 in their own accord. And this is the next problem I will go and bring up in this: Fuuka herself is the main issue of this series.\\n\\n\r\nTo elaborate a little bit, Fuuka specifically as a character, is probably the most despicable character I\u2019ve ever seen in a long ass while when it comes to anime. She\u2019s just a typical mary-sue character, with no actually likable treaits, no actual real motivation when it comes to the music stance, she doesn\u2019t even have a good personality as she comes off as inconsistent when it comes to her traits. In occasions she\u2019s just mean and rather bullying, but then in the other cases she\u2019s energetic and charming. The thing that did actually made me feel a bit of a piss was mostly how this was handled around Episodes 10 and 11 to point out. She pretty much had the \u201capparent\u201d issue with Mr. Truck-kun (which will I will get shortly), so she then decides to go and take more on a career as a standalone, which was nice and all and somehow a bit justified\u2026 but then the next episode it completely contradicted everything that it was done down upon, and making it more like the main reason why the band even existed, wasn\u2019t because they wanted to make a band and want to build it. The reason why the band even existed, is because Fuuka existed, so without her the group is just as shallow as water. Honestly, call me bullshitting or not, but that in itself is technically worse than most of what the Spanish Dramas have done as reasons when it comes to certain areas. If the only reason the band existed was because of her alone then I call that extremely unrealistic. Sure you can argue that without her people can go and try to build their own band again, but because that\u2019s the sole reason the characters had in the first place, this doesn\u2019t count and this type of argument in my opinion gets debunked entirely because of this situation. This just makes her as a character look more like a plot device if anything in this entire series. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention as I have stated, considering what Episode 11 has done to the series where because of Fuuka's attitude it caused the band to get disbanded, and while yes it came back afterwards (albeit that's horrible pacing as hell), it doesn't face the fact the way she acted in this situation. She was being a bitch, that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nMost of what Fuuka, and most of the characters even lack on is bonding and logic, not only those, but they also lack any sort of hard-working. The cast, especially the main two, seems to learn the songs and all as if they were professionals. It comes off as forced and unrealistic because you just do not learn how to even learn a song in a small span of time, and I'm not saying episode numbers, I mean what's in the display. Especially the biggest example is the finale: Yuu learned how to make songs... without really giving any sort of actual hints that he did practiced. And Fuuka, learned how to sing the song Yuu wrote perfectly, without having the actual living knowledge of the song itself. That's when things fall apart in the band and character aspect, they don't even feel a slight of hint of development nor hints of practice, it comes off out of nowhere without really showing anything. Which is fucking terrible.\\n\\n\r\nMy next issue which is something I\u2019m not too familiar with the manga, but this has been apparent anyways: Deviation of the Original Source Material. Despite me giving spoilers in the previous segment, let me go and summarize it for you: Basically, the anime was supposed to take this \u201ctwist\u201d or \u201cturning point\u201d to where the entire band and Yuu himself would learn from this, which goes to a different direction of the manga afterwards. As far as I am concerned by people, this \u201ctwist\u201d was so bad, a lot of people gave backlash towards the author of Fuuka, Seo Kouji, for making this decision for the manga source. So, in one of the articles I have read which was released a week or so (by the time this review is released), the author explains that when he made this decision, the one reason why he made the change in the manga is to obviously put Yuu in a place where he has to move on as well with building the band with the others. This doesn\u2019t sound bad as the intentions while being rather poor regardless when it came to the anime (at least cannon wise) was poorly handled anyways but the reasons would be semi-justified albeit very forced in the end from what I am getting at, I can see that working. He pretty much wanted an anime where \u201cFuuka lives\u201d so to say, so in that case the reason why he did that was to pretty much give some of the fans that likes that character a \u201chappy ending\u201d so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn\u2019t sound bad on paper if he wants to make the said character stay alive, but then let me ask you this question. If the intention of said changes of the original source material was to have her have a happy ending: \\n\\n\r\nWhy did you pretty much made Fuuka as a character, especially the episode 11, so dislikable beyond belief? If you wanted to at the very least make her have a happy ending, you shouldn\u2019t have her act this way in the first place, and the reason why is because nobody, including myself, will not buy this decision as it doesn\u2019t really let me and anyone support her, in fact it goes for the opposite direction of what it could be intended.\\n\\n\r\nWhy did you pretty much teased the relationship or forcing development between Koyuki and Yuu, only to then throw that development as pointless? Instead of giving Koyuki screentime and development towards Yuu to build up the relationship, you could easily at least give the suggestion to the staff to focus more on Fuuka as a character with her relationship with Yuu, especially since in the anime they don\u2019t have any sort of romantic chemistry or hinting whatsoever. It comes off as forced and unrealistic as hell. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe it can\u2019t be the mangaka\u2019s fault, but either way someone should have thought of this before making this desperate and failure attempt at writing romance and development, since it doesn\u2019t come off as good as it looked on paper. It just falls apart like papers.\\n\\n\r\nThe other issue that I find with this series is the Visual Presentation and how the art looks. To pretty much give you a bit of a background, this is pretty much produced by Diomedea which was a studio that at the very least for me, had 2 good winning streaks in terms of the shows from last year. Being Handa-kun and Girlish Number, two shows while not being extremely amazing, those had decent to good characters, they have either decent to good stories and way they were executed, and how they worked with the comedy. I know comparing a comedy and a drama would be a bit of a stretch but getting to the point: Those two's strengths had good or decent visuals. Handa-kun is probably decent looking albeit some of the animation can be alright and bland, while Girlish Number while it dipped down in terms of the art later on it was still looking a bit consistent. \\n\\n\r\nFuuka's case? None. The art is just mostly bland and very not appealing, the direction is just atrocious when it comes to that as well as everything feels for the most part rather static, animation is mediocre at best for the most part with the exception of few scenarios where it looked decent, as well as the ways the characters looked, although they stayed at least stayed true to the source material from what I can gather, for some reason the way it looks is just... meh. Just, mediocre all the way imaginable. Not interesting, not pretty, nor at least handling on its own. Overall this is one of the few saving graces with the show.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the problem with this show which is the most obvious one to look at: Poor Direction. Basically, the show doesn\u2019t know what it wants to be when it comes to the genres, the staff do not really know how to even handle these and making these work, or maybe they don\u2019t know how to make what Seo suggested or anything of the sorts. The point is, the show falls off as pretty terrible directed due to the fact that the transitions, visual presentation, the way it was handling its own themes and structure, its own clich\u00e9s and genres at the worst way possible, and in the not only most predictable way, but in the most insulting way as possible too. I know people from my end that felt like this show insults them, and one of my friends is an avid musician for nearly 10 years, so in some sense when a show fails to do what the person likes from the genre or poorly handles its own themes and execution, it\u2019s a bigger problem. The reason why it is a problem is because this show might be the worst to represent the genre. It\u2019s bland, it\u2019s executed poorly, it\u2019s uninteresting, it\u2019s forced and contrived, messy writing to the core. Honestly, I can\u2019t really blame anyone for this series at the very least. I can understand why they feel this way, and that\u2019s totally fine. I believe this show fails in almost everything in the regard to this, exception of the music which is actually the only redeeming factor of the show alone, albeit not impressive, it\u2019s not that great either. The EDs are probably the highlights of the show as well as the inserts. Other than that, nothing too much about the show.\\n\\n\r\nFuuka could be a pretty decent show in the end, it could be somewhat decent with at least doing some twinkies to go and fix the problems, possibly the manga could have wanted. But the problem comes that all of these, from its execution from both writing, original content, characters, drama, thematic structure, etc. Comes off as so bullshit, that there\u2019s nearly no redeeming qualities in this series at all. You pretty much have a show that is essentially \u201cHow to not Write a Drama Series\u201d in a nutshell, and this is coming from someone that has a inconsistent liking for shows as you would be aware. I do not Recommend Fuuka to anyone over here if you are going to go and check it out, please just go and save yourself from this mess story and a sad excuse of a \"drama\".",

The mediocre meter measured a change of 0.43, in other words, the ending and the last minute changes destroyed the animation. It is boring and mediocre. We want to block it in our memory next to Bing Bong. Usually, a series will rise in the last chapters, but Fuuka is one exception let me correct that, 2017 winter season deception. \r\nNo matter if you follow the manga or not, you will feel that they took the wrong direction. We can't call the anime an adaptation because it is a sidestory. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation had potential, but the developments killed any chance of seeing a good narrative. The pacing is horrible. The characters aren't well developed. In this fantastic world, you can be a musician using the 24 hours magical training, and you will get a studio record contract after playing a school fair and a single club concert guaranteed, no hard training needed. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are different in the manga. For example, imagine Vegeta. In the manga, he is arrogant, self- entitled and ruthless, but now we take him into the animation and change him as the lover of all the living creatures. It is like seeing a dog eating cat food and meowing.\\n\\n\r\nYou can't explain why they focus several episodes on some characters if they were planning to trash them. The drama is forced. The romance is weird, from nowhere the characters start loving each other. Their actions and decisions lack background because the story isn't well developed. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a big crater in the story, details that you can't explain or aren't needed for the new thing. Even if they wanted to change the story from the manga, they shouldn't tease the watchers with details from the manga (street lights). There were better solutions than this aberration, and we could have enjoyed it more. \\n\\n\r\nBut not everything is bad. There are some cameos with Suzuka if you are a follower of that story. The art is fine, and the music is good. I am wondering if the main idea of the adaptation was selling the songs because selling the episodes is going to be a pain. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, if you want to spend some fun time, perhaps you should pick other animation, you could feel disappointed after watching this. My score is 5.0, I saw Suzuka, but I wanted to see this animated in a different way. All these decisions killed any opportunity for a second season\\n\\n\r\nNow let's give this adaptation some awards (for more info read my profile). I will give this the Picard's Facepalm Award; the School Days give me other ending Award and the Sakura Haruno Character Award.",

            "content": "So I saw that this anime had a not of negative reviews, but life's too short to hate things, so I decided to make this review to touch on the parts that I found great and where it could have done better.\r\nFirst of All, this anime is a music/romance anime, at first I thought it was a weird combination, but i felt like it actually worked really well. It's also a music anime which you don't need to be ashamed of if any of your parents catch you watching it (No stages full of girls doing cringy cut/paste dancing in horrible fps). So the animestarts off weird, i personally did not enjoy the first episode as much as the others as i felt like the meeting of the characters was completely unnatural and felt a little forced. Regardless, the characters develop a friendship in the first episode despite their rocky beginnings. The more episodes I watched, the more I actually enjoyed. \\n\r\nFuuka is a sweet, adorable girl with a passion for music, and is incredibly friendly, and cares deeply about her friends. She is shy, and unexperienced with love, and likewise with Yuu, so their characters are quite cute as they eventually develop feelings for one another despite Yuu and Fuuka have a slight speedbump in their relationship, allowing for them to discover what the other means to them.\\n\r\nOn to the music side of things, the sense of time in this anime is a little weird being honest, like at times it skips days,weeks, months which i personally feel works with this anime, as it saves having montages of characters developing their skills. The anime did make it seem like learning an instrument and making a song is childs play, which we all know for a fact that its quite the opposite. The first song the band learns is Climbers high by a band in the anime called Hedgehogs (whom also play a vital role in the development of the music),  and the song was played at the schools culture festival which had a shaking start, but as the band began playing, the crowd warmed up to them and it was a great success. I have no clue why, but when the band was playing and having a great time, I was always getting goosebumps while watching it, i guess I was so happy for everyone. \\n\r\nAnyways, im sick of writing a review so imma just say again that lifes too short to hate things, watch an anime and look for the things you enjoyed about it, and not the things you didnt.",

And in Fuuka is the same. Characters? The only good one is maybe Fuuka or Sara and I said, MAYBE. But this guy likes plot twists so, spoiler ahead, he killed Fuuka using truck-sama . Well, he is going to kill Fuuka again in the anime. And the rest of the cast is filler.

Or maybe, the skirts in Japan are so fucking short that you can easily see the panties of any girl wearing them. Btw, Fuuka is a little bit crazy.

In the manga they dropped out high school like YOLO and only the gay one is the only one that graduated. \\n\\n\r\nAnother spoiler ahead.

My reaction after finishing its (currently) 9 dreadful episodes is one of repulsion, disgust, and pure anger. This anime does everything wrong and then some, but let's start with the basics.\r\nThe story is stupid and unfocused. The drama is some of the most forced I've seen in my life. The characters are unnatural and borderline retarded for the sake of petty drama.\r\nThe music section of the show is no better.Yuu Haruna Twitter Man plays the D Chord and a C comes out, and that's all you need to know about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is terrible and lazy, plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nI'm opposed to anything with an Ecchi tag, and this anime is the reason why. I bet all the sexually repressed 12-year olds were fucking loving the bathing scenes. Congratulations to them, I hope your hormones were properly activated.\\n\\n\r\nFUCK Fukka. I'll probably be unironically writing a fanfiction where Yuu Haruna dies a slow, painful death\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: After the first 9 episodes, Fuuka stops being a forced, unbearable trainwreck and becomes obnoxiously generic instead. This apparently coincides with the point where they deviated from the source work, which is telling. I'm a sucker for romances and good endings though, so the score goes up to a 2.

Personally, my favourite are animes about magic (lots of fantasy basicly) so any other must really try hard to get my attention.\r\nWhat drew my attention was the energy of the main character Fuuka, I tend to be alike a little (hehe). So it kind of swept me on board this anime and I continued watching. Whether you believe me or not, I really thought it would end different. You know what I mean I don't have to spoiler. But the factthat it didn't, maybe I liked that even more. It was more honest this way, no matter how hard the truth can be.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the pace of the anime, from time to time you hear them say 'it's been x weeks' so you know time is really passing by fast and you're only seeing the important parts. (Like you know, even in soap series you don't see everything like every toilet visit for instance.) They could have made this a 24 episodes anime but I like it better this way, it showed us what it wanted to show and no unnecessarily information to fill it up. \\n\\n\r\nThe art work is also great, I just can't stand to watch those old or bad quality animes. (sorry) Art work is really important for me because it brings the emotions out better.\\n\\n\r\nSound was great, I love how we actually heard their songs. (instead of skipping that part because of expenses) But also their practices and everything in between. \\n\\n\r\nIt bothered me a little how long it took them to realize who was in love with who. But I guess even if that wasn't the problem, it's still not easy. Being in love that is. But besides that, there were also characters who seemed to know exactly what was going on and I wish them the best. \u2665\u263a \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really liked this anime ( I didn't cry!... I didn't!!)\\n\\n\r\nSo I'd definitely recommend it!",

            "content": "There\u2019s a type of show that has been showing up more and more in recent seasons, whether we as critics and reviewers like it or not. These are the shows whose success relies completely on how much the viewer likes a single character, with all of the show\u2019s potential wasted on making this character as interesting and appealing as possible. Unfortunately, the result is, more often than not, a show with a cast of boring cardboard cutouts overshadowed by a single interesting character whose personality is a horrible Frankenstein\u2019s monster of character traits that, despite not meshing, the show\u2019s creators desperately hope will appeal tomany fans.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cFuuka,\u201d Diomedia\u2019s latest production, is one such show.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame, honestly. Diomedia\u2019s previous work, \u201cGi(a)rlish Number,\u201d was thoroughly enjoyable due to its wide and well-developed cast of characters. Each character in \u201cGi(a)rlish Number\u201d exhibited a specific set of character traits that could be identified and explained easily, character traits which managed to bounce off of each other and create legitimately interesting interactions. It came as a surprise, of course, to me when I was told by a friend that \u201cFuuka\u201d was quite the opposite.\\n\\n\r\n\tCHARACTERS - 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said before, the entire show is carried by a single character - Fuuka Akitsuki. As this is an ecchi romance, what ultimately decides Fuuka's success as a character is how appealing she is to the viewer. Her character hits on some of the right notes - She's very cute, for one, and certainly stands out in a crowd, given her pretty design and unique style of dressing. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Fuuka only stands out visually. Personality-wise, it's very difficult to figure out what kind of person she actually is. One moment she's acting defensive and violent, and the next she is acting clingy and romantic. Fuuka seemingly has trouble understanding what other characters are thinking, as well. At one point she catches the protagonist with a childhood friend and immediately jumps to the conclusion that this friend is the protagonist's girlfriend. After she runs away, the protagonist tries to talk to her, but she gives him the silent treatment until eventually punching him and saying \"baka\" in a very generic tsundere voice. Now, it's only natural to have mood swings, and, for some characters, mood swings can become a very entertaining plot point. But Fuuka's mood swings are little more than an annoyance, and are especially jarring due to their stark contrast against the two-dimensionality of the rest of the cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a run-of-the-mill, obnoxiously dense high-schooler, someone who can't help but get into perverted situations and then not understand what's going on. Usually, I can tolerate annoying characters as long as their annoying traits either make sense within the context of the narrative or advance the plot. However, this isn't true for our protagonist. When faced with a difficult task such as playing the bass for a rock band, he has the typical shounen-protagonist response of telling himself that he'll \"do his best.\" I mentioned previously how Fuuka reacts to his being with this childhood friend. Well, he barely attempts to explain to Fuuka what's actually going on. The two main characters are so infuriatingly unable to understand what's happening that their misunderstandings drive the entire plot. If there's a better definition of \"contrivance,\" I'm not aware that it exists.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they're also pretty cookie-cutter. There's a gay guy whose entire personality is defined by his homosexuality, a controlling idol who would probably be one of my favorite characters if we actually learned more about her motivation and her reasons for existing other than providing forced tension between Fuuka and our protagonist, and a legion of sisters who always seem to be naked when our protagonist comes home for no purpose other than fanservice. There's not much else to say here.\\n\\n\r\n\tVISUALS - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDiomedia has impressed me pretty consistently with their visual style. The characters are drawn with realistic proportions (with the exception of breasts, but it's an ecchi show - they're supposed to be large and attractive) and pretty eyes, and there is solid animation of hair blowing in the wind and of ocean waves crashing. Diomedia's style is characterized by the fact that the lines bordering objects are not black but are instead darker tones of said object's color. This gives the art a very vibrant, fun-to-look-at feel. During the opening sequence, the lines are traditional colors, with the shadows darker than usual in a sort of comic-book style. This is also nice, because it not only sets the opening sequence apart from the rest of the anime, but it gives the feeling of an exciting rock concert.\\n\\n\r\n\tSOUND - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's a show about music. Of course the music is going to be good. The opening theme is performed well, and the female vocalist is especially talented. It reminds me of the ending theme from \"Mob Psycho 100,\" which is one of my personal favorites. \\n\\n\r\nMy one complaint is that, although the song is good, we hear it multiple times in every episode. If something is going to be a shows opening, it's reasonable to assume that we'll hear it at the start of every episode, at the end of the finale, and perhaps one or two times during exciting scenes near the end of the series. However, whenever the band is playing, they play the OP. Once again, the song is good, but it gets old very quickly when you hear it as often as you do. \\n\\n\r\n\tSTORY - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't mean to sound crude, but the story feels like an eighth-grader's goofy sexual fantasy. The contrivances in the plot are absolutely hilarious, creating a perfect storyline for the protagonist that not only gets him into multiple perverted situations with Fuuka but that gets him making out with her not long after they've met. It's completely and totally unrealistic to think that the girl who accuses you of taking photos of her panties would ask you out within the day. It's equally unrealistic to think that she'd let you stare at her ass without noticing what was going on only a few short days later. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a subplot about a rock band which is, unfortunately, thoroughly unoriginal. It feels as though the band was simply thrown in for the sake of giving the story more substance, but the idea of joining a high-school band has been done many times, to a much better effect (May I suggest \"K-On!\"?). More coincidences are left for the viewer to simply accept - The band is missing a bassist and a vocalist, and it just HAPPENS to be Fuuka and the protagonist's favorite band, and these two just HAPPEN to be capable of playing the missing instrument and singing (Speaking of singing, the way that they establish Fuuka's talent is also painfully silly - She and the protagonist are walking home and she suddenly opens her mouth and belts out a really loud, really low song that most likely wakes up half of the people in town who are trying to sleep).\\n\\n\r\nI have a small amount of knowledge of the manga, so I know where the story is going. Without spoiling anything, I must say that the impending plot twist will certainly distinguish Fuuka from other ecchi romance shows. However, the effectiveness of the plot twist will, of course, depend on how much the viewer likes Fuuka herself. If the viewer doesn't feel any emotional attachment to her, the plot twist will likely feel like another contrivance, and will be another unintentionally funny moment. My friend who dropped this show burst out laughing and vowed to watch the rest when I alerted him to this twist.\\n\\n\r\n\tENJOYMENT - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm not too impressed by the show. Having not read the manga, I don't know what direction the series will take after this nebulous plot twist hits, but I doubt that it will totally save the show. As of right now, I don't like Fuuka's character, and I can't see that changing before the end of the series. Of course, the art is still great and the music is enjoyable. I've always liked to see shows about bands and musicians. And I won't lie - I do enjoy the fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, for a show that I started watching on a whim because a friend said it was \"aggressively average,\" I do think I'll keep watching because I'm interested in what direction it might take in the future. If nothing else, it will provide me with a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found this review helpful.\\n",

            "content": "I guess Fuuka is another anime that has a decent rating, but mainly has reviews bashing it.  Luckily, I didn't watch it all and end up hating it so I'll be one of the few so far to give it a higher score.\r\nThe story follows Fuuka and how she came to meet Yuu Haruna.  They end gathering a few other students and they form a band together.  There's romantic stuff thrown into the mix and it ends up just being an enjoyable show as you watch the characters get more attached to each other. \r\nThe art is vibrant and colorful like itshould be for a show based around music.  I really like the character designs and outfits too.  The outfits actually kind of help you tell what the characters main type of role is in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was really good.  The slower music scores worked well for the romantic scenes and drama scenes, while the more upbeat lyrics worked well for their concerts/performances, and happy moments.  Both types of sound tied very nicely together.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are kind of lacking though.  I don't hate any of them, but not all of them are memorable.  At least, the main characters get development.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this each week.  It is something different and all the elements came to together to make it a really enjoyable experience.",

            "content": "Anime original adaptations have always been a heavily debated subject within the anime community.\r\nIn some cases it has resulted in a far superior product than its source material, like with Usagi Drop.\r\nIn other cases it has downright split the franchise's fan base in half, like with Fullmetal Alchemist 2003.\r\nAnd yet in other cases still it has been widely considered to have been a simply terrible decision, like with Akame ga Kill.\r\nWhatever your stance on those particular series may be, I think most of us can at least agree on the fact that going heavily anime original instead of faithfully following the source material is veryhit-or-miss. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it does not. And in Fuuka's case, I am honestly not sure what to think of it, because its original elements ended up turning an already mediocre manga into an equally mediocre anime... but for totally different reasons.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into this though, I would just like to mention that Fuuka is actually a next generation sequel to an older series called Suzuka. To get straight to the point, no you do *not* need to watch/read it before watching this anime as they are wholly separate stories. All you really need to know is that the protagonist and main heroine of Suzuka are Fuuka's parents, and that they are both national level athletes. That aside Suzuka is a ten times better romance manga than Fuuka has ever been so I would still definitely recommend it if you have the time (never watched its anime though but as far as I know it was a very incomplete adaptation so you are probably better off with the manga).\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, Fuuka is to a large extent a rather old school and clich\u00e9 romance drama. We begin with the fairly reserved and introverted protagonist Haruna Yuu who prefers to spend his spare time on Twitter over hanging out with friends, who one day moves to a new town. There he runs into a strange yet energetic girl with blue hair called Akatsuki Fuuka; a girl running around wearing a pair of headphones and listening to an old CD-player instead of using a phone. Some misunderstandings ensue, but the two of them eventually sort things out, and in the process end up befriending each other. And so begins the spark of a potential romance in the making. Fuuka is someone living with an uncertain future. Because of her parents she is largely expected to become a professional athlete as well, but that is not something she wants to become. Instead, she spends a lot of time outside hanging out with Yuu in order to try to find what she really wants to do in life. And eventually, the answer she arrives at with Yuu's help, is music, which alongside romance is the central theme of the story as the two of them set out to start a band together with their friends from school.\\n\\n\r\nIt all sounds simple enough, but unfortunately, there are some serious problems with Fuuka as an anime. First and foremost, the drama is incredibly forced and unnatural more often than not. Numerous times we have girls just so happening to show up at *just* the right/wrong moment in order to catch Yuu in some interaction with another girl, leading to misunderstanding upon misunderstanding which the story then has to go about an episode or two sorting out only to return to the status quo again. There is even a scene in the first episode where Yuu and Fuuka are supposed to meet up in town and end up missing each other for a ridiculously long time just because they were standing on opposite sides of a statue at their decided meeting location. I mean seriously? Just how stupid is that? Or how about how she just casually breaks his phone in the opening scene of the show just because he (completely unintentionally) caught a glimpse of her panties? I mean people... would not normally do that, not to mention how Yuu actually reacts to the situation as if it somehow *is* normal. The story has a tendency of generating its continuity through quite simply retarded character behavior which in turn results in drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem is the characters themselves. While Fuuka is an all-round likable girl with her cheerful and constantly energetic personality, she, just like everyone else in the show, has a tendency to sometimes act incredibly abnormal just for sake of drama as mentioned previously. But you also have to ask just why she would fall in love with Yuu to begin with? Sure, he helped her find a new passion in music by starting a band together, but beyond that Yuu is kind of a doormat. He is cautious and anti-social in nature and generally just follows along wherever Fuuka drags him along, and just feels incredibly bland and uninteresting in general. And do not even get me started on the other band members, they are so forgettable and have so little character development that their sole purpose in the show is effectively to be Yuu's and Fuuka's sidekicks by providing instrumental support. The final character of note is Hinashi Koyuki: an old childhood friend of Yuu who has now become a popular idol. She creates what is a rather unnecessary love triangle by frequently trying to get in-between Fuuka and Yuu, which not only causes drama in-between them but also on a larger scale when her idol otaku fans find out about her feelings after some pictures end up being leaked on the internet. And now we are really getting into the epitome of ridiculous character behavior by seeing how aggressively and violently some of her fans react to the news. Granted I am well aware that there are in fact some really crazy idol fans out there in the real world too, but still come on.\\n\\n\r\nThe third and final major issue with Fuuka is the anime original content. This is fairly difficult to talk about without spoiling anything, but basically everything from the middle of episode eight and onwards is all anime original. Now, the manga is quite infamous for having one of the most wtf plot twists ever a couple of volumes in which completely alters the story for all future, and not in a good way. This also happens to be one of the worst kept secrets in the anime community though so if you have somehow avoided being spoiled on this then... congratulations. As stupid as this development was though, it was at least quite unique, and really it is without a doubt the most memorable part of the entire manga. So when the anime then decided to not even adapt this at all and instead to go off do something different altogether, I was left with some rather mixed feelings. Sure, if the original version is bad to begin with then doing something else in the anime is not a bad idea on paper, but replacing it with something equally mediocre is not really an improvement. The manga's version was at least unorthodox and unexpected even if it was dumb, but the anime's version is bad *and* generic on top of it. I do not know about you, but personally I would rather take the former. Furthermore, the reason the manga's development is bad is not because of the twist itself (that was actually kind of cool I thought), but rather that the author seemingly ran out of steam completely because ever since it happened, there has been absolutely nothing good happening in it, and that is now over 100 chapters ago... which is kind of inexcusable. However, since the anime would not have covered very far beyond the twist with merely 12 episodes anyway, that would not really have been a problem so why not just adapt it faithfully for as long as the timespan allows and then stop? That would have made sense to me. At the very least it should have been better than the manga if so, but now... I am not so sure. Because instead, we are left with a bunch of additional forced drama between Yuu, Fuuka and Koyuki for our anime original ending, with a heavily increased emphasis on the latter compared to the manga. And while I guess we at least got a sort of conclusive ending for anime-only viewers this way, it still felt very underwhelming in the end.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to an interview with the anime staff and the original mangaka uploaded to Animenewsnetwork on March 17th, Seo Kouji said that while he had never regretted taking the manga in the peculiar direction he did, he had always been thinking about the what-if scenario where had decided not to, and thus said that if Fuuka was finally getting an anime adaptation he would like to take the chance to showcase this what-if scenario in the anime instead, and apparently the anime's producer thought the same. I guess that is a simple and understandable reason, but it also feels more like self-satisfaction than trying to come up with the best final product anime-wise to me. Also, if he really felt that way, was there any reason to throw in all these subtle teasers about the twist throughout the anime only to then never adapt it anyway? It literally feels like nothing but an attempt at trolling and baiting those anime viewers who had already read the manga, which would be rather unprofessional if so.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is anything positive to mention about this anime though, it would definitely be the music. Of course this might be expected to go hand-in-hand with being an actual music anime, but either way the live performances in Fuuka are actually pretty awesome. Especially the first half of episode eight (right before the original content starts) was really enjoyable to listen to, and by far the best scene of the anime. Granted, this naturally depends on your taste in music as well, but at the very least I think the band performances were really well-made when they actually gave it their all (though it would have been nice if there was a greater song repertoire used throughout the anime). And that is one thing which was most certainly a hell of a lot better than in the manga; there are few things more awkward than reading about a supposedly awesome concert when all you are hearing is the deafening sound of complete and utter silence set to still imagery.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, the main problems with Fuuka stem from the manga being mediocre to begin with rather than it being anyone at Diomedea's fault, and while the decision to go anime original is questionable and in my mind probably wrong, I can still somewhat understand it, and relatively speaking it still resulted in a final product which is not necessarily too much worse than its source material (which admittedly does not say very much). The music elements of the show also come across a lot better in anime format due to actual presence of audio this time, so overall I would still say this was an okay-ish adaptation relative to the manga all things considered. Unfortunately, that still does not make it a very good anime in this case.",

            "content": "Fuuka's main character is the epitome of patience, forgiveness, and all around charity. We can observe some of this overflowing generosity in even the very first episode. Now our main protagonist here is a shining example of peace, perhaps comparable to Martin Luther King Junior or Ghandi, but that wouldn't be very humble or modest, now would it? See, I myself am not a very patient or forgiving person, I'll admit. I'll sometimes be hateful and rude to other who may not deserve that hate. After watching Fuuka, I've realized the error of my ways and now strive to become just like the main character.Well what makes this main character so great, you ask? \\n\\n\r\nListen carefully now. In the very first episode we can begin to see the shining purity of the main character. Within just two days, he gets his all important phone broken twice by the same woman. Normally, I would have been infuriated by this woman's actions, bubbling with rage. But does out protagonist falter? No, he calmly just pays up several hundred dollars without protest. But the story of our protagonist's charity does not end here, no no. See, the woman who broke his phone both times did not ever compensate or apologize in the slightest for her actions, but luckily for her, our shining hero is a kind and patient man. Because he was such a gentleman, he took the lady out on a date to her favorite movie! How wonderful and kind!\\n\\n\r\nSee, we could all learn from this man's example- all of us; no matter who you are, whether it be the president of the United States or a young businessman. If your house has been robbed of tens of thousands of dollars worth of cash and property, don't take the hasty action of calling the police; instead, track down the thief yourself, apologize for not having more valuable items for him/her to take, and calmly offer to instead give your house to him/her as compensation.",

            "content": "What makes a good character? In my opinion, the most essential thing of all is a relatable personality. Otherwise, the audience won\u2019t be able to sympathise with the character at all. This is why people are criticising Kirito from Sword Art Online for being too overpowered; while at the same time praising Saitama from One Punch Man even though he\u2019s litteraly one of the most overpowered characters in all of fiction including the bible. What makes us care about him is his altruism and normal life style. He\u2019s depicted as a normal dude who just happens to be a godlike figure, whereas Kirito is depictedas a godlike figure who just happens to be a normal dude.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also why the characters in Fuuka never succeeds in making me give two shits about them. From the get go we are presented with a main character whose actions are as logical as a flat Earth painted by Dali. Not only does he decide to hang out with the psycho who just smashed his phone into a million pieces, but he also decides not to mention the fact that the very famous singer said psycho loves is an old childhood friend of his; something he doesn\u2019t tell her until episode four, after they\u2019ve gone to her concert together. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where we as an audience gets pulled out of the immersion of the show. Because just like a magic trick isn\u2019t as effective if we\u2019re able to see the card hidden in the sleeve, a show loses its credibility if the audience are able to see the hand of the director. In this case it\u2019s painfully obvious that the only reason why the main character acts as he does, is to create drama later on. In other words, the show sacrifices its inner logic in favor of a spicy story.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the whole show is a little bit too convenient. The main character just happens to be a childhood friend of Fuuka\u2019s favorite singer. Their teacher just happens to be a member of Fuuka\u2019s favorite band. The person Yuu tweets with just happens to be sitting in front of him. The list goes on. And when you have so many examples of coincidences stacked on top of each other, it becomes impossible to relate to anything that happens just because it\u2019s so unbelievable.\\n\\n\r\nThe shallow characters combined with the bad story structure results in a big ol\u2019 mess. The show never seems to figure out what it wants to be, and by the time you reach the end you get a feeling of what was the point? The only real charachter development in the whole show is that Yuu learns how to play the bass on a professional level in the span of what feels like a few weeks, that\u2019s it. In the end, Fuuka expects you to relate to unrelatable characters and believe an unbelievable story. And not to mention, it\u2019s pretty &#@% boring.\\n",

            "content": "I believe that anime like Fuuka are a breed apart from the usual slice of life anime that we've been struck with as of late. \r\nYou guys all know what I'm talking about; those anime that show great promise initially but then taper off into bitter disappointment or worse boredom. \r\nFuuka manages to break the barrier set by these mediocre anime in several regards. \r\nI will be the first to admit that its story is nothing original but neither is it terrible and that's exactly what you want in a slice of life. The art style is great to look at and the soundboard ofthe series is better than many others I have heard (although I have found slice of lifers to have generally fantastic music). \\n\\n\r\nWhere this series shines though is in its characters and its progression of the story. Rare is the anime these days where you feel that there is actual progression of the story with each episode. While the main character is nothing too special the heroine possesses a kind of bubbly charm unique to her character which really stands out, particularly as this is a romance anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like the most is that there is a clear progression of the relationship between the two leads and it is neither at a snails pace nor breakneck quick in its development. \\n\\n\r\n5 episodes in and I am decently confident that in this anime we might actually be left off with a confirmed relationship rather than the \"friends but not friends\" endings we get with most \"romance\" anime.",

It's fine if an anime has a bit of ecchi in it, but please, please make it bearable to watch. \r\n  Another thing that completley ruined this anime was the childhood friend. You knew she'd never win thelove triangle based on the main charecter's stupidity! He can't even realise when a girl is in love with him! Plus, who would fall for a bland, dull guy like that? It's just not realistic!\\n\r\n  Fuuka is not even a good charecter. We don't seen enough backstory to this charecter to even like her  or not.

The biggest example here is the songs playd by the band, which don't sound at all like they are being played live OR by a group of amateurs.\r\n2: Awful pacing. Everything is just so very slow, with a lot of lingering unanimated shots. The whole story could be better conveyed with 12 10-minute episodes. I'd be willing to bet it would be a more enjoyable experience.\r\n3: A lot of unnecessary scenes, like the truck scene from episode 10. I'm pretty sure theycould have found a better way to do what that scene needed to do, so that it didn't have to feel so jarring.\\n\\n\r\n4: Stupid, unfunny jokes based around a certain character's sexuality.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing the series tried to do, and managed to pull it off, even if it was not as good as one might wish:\\n\\n\r\nThere was some character development, enough for there to be a feeling that the story was evolving and going somewhere. The stakes for each character were well-defined, but the show felt the need to shove scene upon scene on the viewer's face to get them across, which led to many a boring scene. The show could really benefit from more subtlelty.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: to anyone who hates clich\u00e9s, this anime is certainly not for you.

            "content": "Intro \r\nFuuka based off the manga of the same name is a drama/music anime. Usually music animes aren\u2019t really a genre that I consider that often however from reading the synopsis of the plot and seeing what it was like it piqued my interest. Although I haven\u2019t read the source material yet after this drama I\u2019ll be interested to see it. \r\nStory and setting \r\nThe story for Fuuka largely follows the character of Yuu Haruna a teenager that moved to a nearby town to live with is sisters after his father was moved overseas for work. In the town Yuu encounters several interesting people butthe one that stands out is Fuuka who he meets in the worst way possible. After clearing up any misunderstandings that they had Fuuka and Yuu become fast friends and after some rather sudden inspiration decided to form a band consisting of five people that are from the same school though not known to each other. The story alternates between the performances and the struggles of the band and the interpersonal relationships of Yuu, Fuuka and several main and support characters like Koyuki. The anime is largely set in Tokyo although it moves to other places when needed. \\n\r\nLike most anime Fuuka\u2019s story consists of a main plot line that is interspersed with several subplot lines that provide greater insight into some characters. Although I haven\u2019t read the manga some of my friends do and I know that some parts of the anime were changed better accommodate characters that didn\u2019t have as much parts in the manga and give them more of a chance. While I did appreciate the fact that the writers gave the character Koyuki who is my favourite female character on here more screen time I feel that if Fuuka had her original fate things maybe would have been better. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I quite liked the story as it not only gave the chance for Yuu and Fuuka to create a band and have fun with something that they both enjoy but also meet others that have the same passion. As a music anime, the key thing is not only do they need to have a strong vocalist but they also need to have a great band backing them up. In this it was nice to see each of the members who originally did not gel to eventually discover that they liked it and get serious and practice. Watching it all come together in one of their performances was impressive. The other part of the main plot is the interpersonal relationships which for the most part are focused on Yuu and the girls Fuuka and Koyuki. I felt that the romance part of the show was well done with both girls being pretty strong characters that have great personalities. In the end, I felt that the romance plot line was handled well enough though I feel that Koyuki was the better girl. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFuuka \\n\\n\r\nFuuka voiced by veteran seiyuu Lynn of High school fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and the character that the anime/manga is named after. She serves as the main heroine for the story. A positive, upbeat and cheerful girl that\u2019s also rather hyperactive Fuuka acts as the heart of not just the story but also the band. Fuuka is an energetic girl who despite being quick to get angry generally will be the one that says sorry first and is quite friendly. Despite looking like she\u2019s enjoying her high school life Fuuka has feels that she has a hole in her life that makes her life seem empty. This and her love with music was what ultimately caused her to form her own band. The most notable trait of Fuuka is arguably her positive and cheerful nature in that she can stay positive in just about any situation. The frustration that Fuuka feels as part of the emptiness in her life is one of the core reasons for forming the series titular band Fallen moon both to satisfy he love for music both in performing and creating and to enjoy her high school life properly. Fuuka\u2019s personality changes very little over the series but meeting Yuu does alter some of her outlooks in life. Fuuka\u2019s interactions with Yuu is actually quite funny especially when they are still unsure about the feelings that they have for each other. I feel that Fuuka\u2019s seiyuu Lynn actually did a pretty good job voicing her. \\n\\n\r\nYu\\n\\n\r\nYu Haruna voiced by veteran voice actor Yusuke Kobayashi of Re Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the anime.  A Decent, quiet and good natured teenager that moves to Tokyo to live with his sisters after his parents were moved to other country for work Fuuka acts as the conscience and the glue of the band. A good-natured teenager that seems to have an unusual obsession with Twitter Yu can be best described as a rather normal looking teenager that doesn\u2019t actually stand out that much. This isn\u2019t helped by the fact that Yu is actually pretty quiet by nature which reinforces people\u2019s views. Unlike Fuuka who loves music Yu\u2019s love for it did not materialize until the band was formed. Even then his perception towards music which actually forms a part of the main plot didn\u2019t start to change until much later. However, as Yuu continued to practice and perform with the band Yu grew to both appreciate not just the making of music but also of the fun that you get from playing instruments with others that share your passions. This caused his normal quiet and reserved personality to change and Yu become more positive and happy and allowed him to see that there is more to life than twitter. The gradual change in Yu\u2019s personality I felt was well done and I feel that this change was quite natural as well. I feel that Yu\u2019s voice actor Yusuke Kobayashi did a great job voicing Yu. \\n\\n\r\nKoyuki \\n\\n\r\nKoyuki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of the irregular at magic high school and Owari no seraph fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the second main female lead. Kind, caring and understanding Koyuki is a teenager and a popular pop singer that is quite popular in Japan. A childhood friend of Yu\u2019s Koyuki and Yu used to hang out pretty much every day when they were little and Yu\u2019s nickname for her actually comes from when he saw her sing a song and heard how nice her voice was. In the anime, Yu and Koyuki only met again recently as they were separated when they were little due to family circumstances. Being a childhood friend Koyuki actually is the one that understands Yuu the most and she tries to help Yu when needed. Koyuki also has feelings for Yu that slowly become apparent as the series goes on. Though im not sure how Koyuki\u2019s act was handled in the manga I actually liked the romance between Yu and Koyuki as it felt natural and that both had feelings for each other both then and now. As a pop singer that\u2019s also voiced by a veteran seiyuu singer the character Koyuki within the story was given several songs that she sung with my favourite actually being the duet between her and Fuuka. I felt that each of these performances was pretty strong. I also felt that the balance between a pop idols career and her personal life while certainly not as true as it shows was pretty well done. Overall I felt that Saori Hayami did a excellent job portraying Koyuki as a sweet and endearing childhood friend that still loves the main character after all this time.  \\n\\n\r\nSara \\n\r\nSara voiced by veteran seiyuu Mikako Komatsu of Tales of Zestiria and Hai to gensou no grimgar fame is one of the main characters of the show and is one of the members of Fuuka\u2019s band. Sara is one of the members of the band and one of Fuuka and Yu\u2019s friends. A second-year student that attends the same high school as Yu and the rest of the band Sara can be described as quiet, reserved and shy and not good around people. In this she is pretty similar to Yu right down to the fact that both are twitter users. In the anime, Sara and Yu unknowingly know each other which when realized created a rather funny conversation in which Sara\u2019s personality changed completely. In the beginning, Sara\u2019s personality created a number of problems due to the fact that she preferred to do things her way while her quiet nature made it difficult for others to talk to her. Apart from her brother Sara\u2019s closest relationship is arguably with Yu as to Sara he is the only person that she knows both online and offline and as such is one of the few that she feels comfortable to be around with. I feel that the change in Sara\u2019s personality was quite natural and seeing her lose composure over Yu is pretty funny. I feel that her seiyuu Mikako Komatsu did a pretty good job here. \\n\\n\r\nMakoto \\n\\n\r\nMakoto voiced by veteran voice actor Soma Saito of Divine gate and Rokka no yuusha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is part of Fuuka\u2019s band. Makoto is first year student like Yuu and Fuuka and is actually one of Fuuka\u2019s old friends. A calm, friendly and good natured person Makoto usually serves as the voice of reason within the band. Makoto shares a passion for music like Fuuka and actually is an accomplished piano player having won many competitions. In the band, he serves as the keyboardist. Makoto is the only character in the series that seems to have a problem that\u2019s causing him to worry that wasn\u2019t sorted out in this series. In this case, it\u2019s his relationship with his family. Despite this Makoto is well liked by many people due to his easy-going nature and he\u2019s always the one that breaks up tense situations. I feel that his voice actor Soma Saito did a good job portraying him. \\n\\n\r\nNachi \\n\r\nNachi voiced by veteran voice actor Kazuyuki Okitsu of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio and Orange fame is one of the main characters of the series and is part of Fuuka\u2019s band. A high school student and a former member of the school\u2019s track team Nachi can be best described as a friendly, serious and solid person that is also passionate about things that he does. Originally Nachi was part of the school\u2019s track team that was trying hard to recruit Fuuka having seen her run times but this passion of his soon changed to music after realizing how fun it could be. Nachi is perhaps the one character that took the longest to actually get into the band but later become a pretty good drummer and grew to like being in the band. Though Nachi did not want to do music at first and did not have high hopes about being good at it Nachi proved to be a capable drummer for the band having actually owned a drum set for some time. Though unwilling at first Nachi like everyone else in the band grew to love performing and having fun with friends. \\n\\n\r\nHedgehog band members \\n\r\nHedgehog\u2019s is a band that existed prior to Fuuka\u2019s forming of her own and is one of the main casts favourite bands.  Formed of five members like most bands they went in hiatus before the events of the story but served as inspiration for Fuuka enough in that she formed her own band.  Over the series, the cast comes into contact with the former members that advice and assist them in their endeavors. The five are voiced by veteran seiyuu\u2019s Yoko Hikasa of the Devil is a part timer fame, Manami Numakura of unlimited Fafnir fame and veteran voice actors Daisuke Hirakawa and Daisuke Ono and Yuichi Nakamura of Denpa Kyoushi and Fairy tail fame. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation\\n\\n\r\nThe arts and animation of the series I felt was pretty good. Character designs I felt were reasonably good as was the animation that was used. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\r\nAs a music anime, the music of course is an important part of the anime\u2019s charm and story. In terms of music I liked both the opening song climber\u2019s high which was sung by the hedgehog through the lead singers seiyuu and the second opening theme Yukihanabi that was sung by Koyuki\u2019s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami. The cover songs that were sung by Fuuka\u2019s band as well as Fuuka\u2019s original song I felt was also well done. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting I felt that Fuuka\u2019s and Koyuki\u2019s seiyuu\u2019s Lynn and Saori Hayami both did a great job portraying their characters in the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\r\nFor a music/drama anime to be successful it needs to have both a strong music element that is able to dazzle the audience with strong songs and music and a good drama story to link the personal relationships of the series characters together in an interesting way. This balance of themes I felt was done reasonably well in this anime as firstly the music element was actually pretty good. This was helped greatly by the amazing singing ability of Fuuka\u2019s seiyuu Lynn which combined with the music by the band members really made their performances a sight to see. The drama element though well designed and executed was not as good. While I did like the fact that the character of Koyuki who actually is my favourite female character on here was given more of a larger role I felt that the romance between Yu and Fuuka felt a bit dragged out. I would have been happy if the anime had followed the manga and let her have the same fate as she did in the manga instead. But in truth that part of the romance felt unnecessarily dragged out. Apart from that the music which was actually quite strong here with regards to both the cover songs and the original songs and the animation were relatively good. Voice acting as noted was also pretty good with Saori Hayami and Lynn doing a fantastic job here as always. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cI love the music, the meaning behind the lyrics and the rhythm that supports them is truly beautiful with the instruments and the vocals.\u201d ~ One of the good points you'll see in this review.\r\nI\u2019ll be reviewing Fuuka as a Manga Reader, what had the tiniest bit of potential to being an ok anime, just melted into nothingness. \r\nFuuka revolved around our main character Yuu who does almost nothing but Twitter. He\u2019ll be on it at his house, or on the streets. However fate pulls Yuu and a certain girl together named Fuuka and of course, we have the usual Cliche misunderstandings, I\u2019ll spare youthe details and just proceed with saying that Yuu got slapped. That\u2019s how things started\\n\\n\r\nI was a bit hesitant when I read the manga. Because it started like this, it made me not wanting to continue reading. However, I moved on, I kept on reading.\\n\\n\r\nSo Yuu bumps into Fuuka, someone who is clearly mostly interested in music, and has favourite artists that are similar to Yuu\u2019s taste as well. That being the Hedgehogs and Koyuki Hinashi. The Hedgehogs are a band that hasn't been around for quite some time due to the disappearances of some of the members. Koyuki on the other hand is none other than the childhood friend of Yuu, which later on, Fuuka finds out.\\n\\n\r\nSo they know that they share similar tastes and as things proceed, Yuu gives Fuuka that little push to make her pursue her dream of becoming an artist, and they went separate ways and pursued their own dreams, hoping to meet each other once more\u2026Except that didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nOnce Fuuka got that push, she decided to make a band. A band that'll blow the socks off of the audience. It consists of Fuuka, Yuu, Mikoto, Sara, and Nachi. The 5 members come together and start practicing with their first song (Sara, Nachi, and Mikoto are all in the same school as Yuu, and they so happen to find them and befriend them and such and then yah they form a band)\\n\\n\r\nSo once they first started practice, they all sounded like 2 salamanders trying to masturbate in front of 5 baby kittens. It was that bad, but that is natural. You won\u2019t get it right the first time, which is why you practice until you get it right. \\n\\n\r\nSo while all this is happening there\u2019s the situation between Yuu, Koyuki, and Fuuka. In which case the 2 girls clearly show some sort of affection for Yuu.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I love some of the girl characters, other characters are bland as heck. I just find them boring with no significant characteristics (I\u2019m looking at you\u2026Yuu) We know Mikoto is gay and is (thankfully) one of the only ones that can stop the drama from happening between Yuu and Fuuka, we know Sara has the hots for Yuu (Which I can say is easily best girl anyway) and we know that Nacho is just\u2026Nachi, the guy who leads the band and drums and stuff.\\n\\n\r\nIf we take all of these into consideration, you can see an average anime. One that isn't the worst thing you'll see, but it isn't the best thing you'll see either. The drama is quite forced and the usual love triangle is as play, as well as a lot of plot conveniences.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there is a love triangle, it\u2019s kind of clear who the winner is. (Hint: It\u2019s in the title ;) )\\n\\n\r\nNow only bashing this anime is not my style. Are there good points? Certainly.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve read the manga, I\u2019m sure you've got a feel of the art style. In the anime you can see that it is clearly different. I do like the art style in the anime and I do love the colours and how it is used effectively. It has a good, kinda consistent flow.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good points would be the fan service. I mean if Ecchi is a genre in this anime, then I\u2019m expecting some fan service. Boy did they deliver. \\n\\n\r\nAt least this anime can showcase some of the hottest bodies out there, so I\u2019m thankful for that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd probably my most favourite good point, the music. I love the music, the meaning behind the lyrics and the rhythm that supports them is truly beautiful with the instruments and the vocals just resonated strongly with my happy feelings. When reading, I was eagerly pondering on what the songs would sound like, and damn do they sound awesome. \\n\\n\r\nAs great as Climbers High is, my absolute favourite song is \u201cA Town Where the Stars Fall.\u201d To the lyrics and the rhythm, to the instruments and the chorus, it truly is a beautiful song. \\n\\n\r\nBut sometimes, hearing Climbers High repetitively might be a tad annoying. Just a bit, at least for me. \\n\\n\r\nI do wish there were more songs but I was satisfied enough that they made a full version of Climbers high and the Town song. It was good enough for me to at least enjoy that.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey the songs at the last episode was pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the art style and music are exceptionally amazing,\\n\\n\r\nthe cliche plot and bland characters easily overtake those nice points.\\n\r\nOh well\u2026It is what it is.  \\n",

Starting from episode 8 they alter the entire story just to give way to their goddess tama-chan! They could have hired a neutral screen writer than a worshiper. The drama is so obviously forced!\r\nI bet this anime will end up not getting any season extension. Good job screen writer! You delayed the anime release for a week justto ruin everything!

            "content": "People seem to be 50/50 with Fuuka, either you like it or you hate it as I haven't encountered anyone who said \"meh its fine\". Let me just start by saying I get why people dislike Fuuka:\r\nThe story is generic, the characters flat with \"quirks\" to give the personality, the \"ecchi\" feels forced and doesnt add to the comedy or develop the story and the drama at times can be a bit far fetched and border the realm of realism.\r\nbut...\r\nEven with all the flaws mentioned I found myself getting lost and invested in the story. The feelings they share, no matter what causes the drama,feels authentic and genuine. You can relate to the problems and struggles that they share as they are universal issues. Social anxiety, identity crises, the need to belong, acceptance and even obsession, all these are things we have encountered at some point.\\n\\n\r\nLast thing I want to mention are the visuals and sound. This is what brings everything together and which makes me forget about the flaws, the atmosphere with every scene feels hand plucked, almost like they didn't care about the story but rather what the story/scene should represent. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend to anyone who doesn't mind or can look past the usual ecchi, slice of life tropes to watch this as it will hook you and keep you waiting for the next episode.",

Also, the characters were well-played, to be teenagers. That message is so important to bring in your daily life, even if it can cost you sometimes. Not to mention the people around you.\r\nIwas also moved by the love-story in the main-story, because that is where the message comes out at it\u00b4s clearest expression.The drawing is excellent and all is well that ends well?!",

            "content": "Written by the same author of \u201cSuzuka\u201d and sharing the same worldline and characters, \u201cFuuka\u201d is a music-centered shitfest of forced and rushed up drama having character's emotionally abused as often as one's blinking. Not forgetting the incest references, of course, showing several naked scenes than necessary, so keep up your family distance on this one. A show that's been accused of having the wrong protagonist, and honestly, childhood friends have had enough of this, and Fuuka doesn't go easy a bit. But that doesn't exclude people from claiming it to be one of their favorites, going as far as paring it with the fantastic\u201cClannad\u201d, that's where I draw a thick line folks, and I'm about to clear the reason about that in this review.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (5/10):\\n\r\nAkitsuki Fuuka (wow how original of the show's title), a clumsy go-lucky highschool girl (the daughter of Akitsuki Yamato and Asahina Suzuka, the protagonists of the indirect prequel of this show, \u201cSuzuka\u201d) is at a very relatable stage of her life, that one hard-to-knock-off-wall that goes about having students decide what they are going to do next. In the other side, you have your typical silent unsocial male protagonist, Haruna Yuu, that has an extreme obsession about sharing every bit of detail about his life on Twitter. The two happen to meet each other, and right from the first episode already manage to get as close as one can call a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And with that, the flaws of the show start to mercilessly attack every sense of logic remaining. I still can't grasp how could an individual (Yuu, the protagonist) join a band with no talent or prior knowledge to music, only being there because some random girl he met told him to. The show at first gives a really focused view on Yuu and Fuuka, I've seen this strategy before, making the viewers ship the heck out of them until we get mercilessly stabbed at the heart by the introduction of this childhood friend that apparently has always had a crush on Yuu. Meet Hinashi Koyuki, both a member of this little love triangle and overall a very famous idol that the other side of the triangle (Fuuka) is a big fan of. \u201cThat is some seriously interesting setup\u201d, said old naive me that had more expectations on this show than it actually delivered upon. Right after she's introduced she goes through causing misfortune between the two only for her to get hurt by the end of the story and the two obvious pair get back along again. Now try to picture that turn of events, but in the most terrible way you can, that's what Fuuka, and extremely below average show in terms of love stories is. And that's excluding the other side characters, like this one girl, Iwami Sara, a girl that showed hostile behavior towards the protagonist at first to only make a complete 180\u00b0 split in personality for no apparent reason going as far as threatening their modest love triangle to becoming a square. I feel that the show could have been better if they focused more about the actual band's growth and them realizing their dreams, but of course, with them having the right qualifications.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\\n\r\nMost definitely the only good thing this show did right, yeah, give me more of them crispy looking animations, those oddly-ordered lines make for such a relaxing view for my eyes. And honestly, without this, the show would have never stand on its feet.\\n\r\nThe color palette was so diverse and colorful, taking a non-realistic art style that really suited this show for being the genre it is. One of the many things I appreciate about Fuuka (rare of me to say) was the sense of fashion, the characters looked as if they were staging for some world-class clothing magazine, all looked very tidy and elegant, and I'm backing this up for you, hips out there. One thing that really left a bad taste on my memory was that adults, kids, and teenagers, all looked similar with no signs of aging gaps, I'm talking about parents looking as young if not younger than their kids, it was ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\\n\r\nBeing a show heavily centered on music, that is if we don't count the childish drama. Those were some really good songs, to be honest, I didn't give the opening theme song credits at first, but it grew on me as far as making me want to clap for them when they decided to feature it as one of their hits on some episodes. The voice acting was decent but could have been better if not for the painfully cringy dialogue they put the actors through. And then again, there is the classic Engrish, one of the strongest, in fact. I really have to emphasize more on how good the music was or else I'm not going to get this unlucky feeling off that I'm getting right now.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (6/10):\\n\r\n\u201cNext please\u201d, that would have been my quote of the day if I was in charge of recruiting actors for a live action and replicas of the show's characters happened to be involved. There was no single memorable character that brought something new with it. You had your friendship above all types of people, and there was also the selfish bastard that goes about ruining everything the show built upon for 10 episodes. 10!!!!! are you kidding me?\\n\r\nShipping was really intense at first, but then, it was like, why even bother, just let this end quickly I don't wanna get rid of my dropped-shows-virginity yet. I can give the protagonist credit at least for curing his addiction to Twitter, but that was it. And to this day, I don't think I'll even know how could someone with no talent in a medium perform that well in it, and in such a short time, it really goes as far as contradicting the philosophical meaning of a \u201cTalent\u201d.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7/10):\\n\r\nIt's very odd to have animals like pigs that eat practically anything that they can swallow, but what's even more mindblowing is how could one enjoy something they criticise this bad. I'm not going to lie on myself, I did have a bit of guilty pleasure watching Fuuka, not because of some deep plot points, not because of the revolutionary characters, but rather how decent it served as a time killer. At least it didn't put me to sleep at night or made me count how many times I yawned every 3 minutes. I had my fair share of rooting, shipping and cheering, but towards the end, it dropped massively.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (6.7/10):\\n\r\nFuuka is a type of show I'm going to be very careful about calling it a good show out loud, there is no way in hell I'll recommend this as a solid romance experience for how bratty and unfunny the drama turned out to be. As for me, seeing that many shows already makes me realize how low in scale this appears next to greater franchises, but for you out there who are planning to have this as one of their first takes on the romance genre, please don't, it would end up affecting your tastes in a bad way.",

This anime destroyed the typical cliches by turning themon their head! it approached the scenes with an air of maturity not found in any other romance i have ever seen. i don't like this genre but i loved this series. its slightly lack luster but its over all an exceptional story. this story had me gripped at every scene with anxiety expecting the worst and being happily surprised.",

It felt rushed in some parts and slow in others, the characters were dull and could have been fleshed out so much more. But of course, why waste air time on character development when you can add in another panty shot or another scene of the main character's sisters in their underwear? I'm still not sure if I actually enjoyed the song \"Climber's High,\" or if I just heard it enough times throughout the duration of this anime that I started to think I enjoyed it justso I could sit through it again. All in all, a pretty mediocre anime that made me feel as if I'd wasted my time.",

            "content": "Fuuka...\r\nI believed that this anime is going to be way better than the manga since I've seen so many changes in the plot from the beginning... But then they screwed up everything and it has finished as it did. \r\nThe point of that why the rating of this anime is going down more and more is just the fact that Seo is an awesome artist, but terrible story writer. But to the point!\r\nYou can scroll down to the overall point just to get general info.\r\n- Story \r\nThe story itself wasn't terrible from the beginning - somehow it drew the attention of many people, right? Andit wasn't different in my case. I really loved first episodes, they are really good I have to say - the way they introduce the whole plot isn't bad. I have to say those first episodes are really enjoyable - they aren't that rushed as the next are. And that's the point.\\n\r\nThe story isn't bad itself at all, but the way they show it is. There are many gaps in the story and things which are not explained.  The biggest pain in the ass of this plot is the fact that they changed few things according to manga. But this intervention isn't bad itself - why you may ask? That's pretty easy to explain - some of the manga readers aren't happy with the way how manga goes, same with anime fans. I'm not big Fuuka fan, but that's truly cool to see her alive after all :) This intervention is really good in my opinion, but the way what they did after that is in so bad taste. If you change the story do it till the end, not like this you did...  I mean - if you change the story it's cool, do it - it's your business but do it with the head.\\n\r\nLet the new story flow not bury it with the old one. It's really bad taste in my opinion. And the way the story is rushed is even worse. They made like 3 episodes with Koyuki (my fav - but it's subjective so it's not important in rating) and they lost some precious time (1h) to make up the story the way it wouldn't be that rushed. *eghem* -the f***ed up-\\n\r\nIf the story had been provided with Koyuki or Fuuka path for the whole time it would be a cool plot, well-made story. But it's not...\\n\r\nFinal result: 3/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\n- Art\\n\r\nThe art is one of the best sides of this show. I mean it's really good - as colorful as the Samsung system overlay xD But that's good, art and the animation quality stands on really high level what is really cool for people like me who enjoys good views (I don't mean fanservice by this) The characters are well drawn, the facial expression is really well made. I really love zooms on Fuuka or Koyuki - they are really good. You can feel it like they are close to ya, and that's cool. I really enjoyed this part of the show. But it's like a game - if only graphics is good, but story or gameplay sucks you can't rate the game well. Sorry.\\n\r\nFinal result: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Music/Sound\\n\r\nOf course, this whole anime is about the music so if it had bad one nobody would even give it a try. Maybe not that strict tho xD But you know what I mean. For me, music has carried this anime to the end.\\n\r\n*SPOILER*\\n\r\nIf not music I would be so bored after rejecting Koyuki - I was even thinking about dropping this anime but I had to finish it.\\n\r\n*END OF SPOILER*\\n\r\nSo the music is on the really high level here, Saori Hayami and the others did a really good job here and there <3 That's a big plus for this show. It's still not the top quality but still really high scored stuff. The voice actors are really well selected to their characters. I really like it.\\n\r\nFinal result: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Characters\\n\r\nOMG - another pain in the ass. I could rate every single character different way because some of them are truly awesome created, some of them are really bad because of the role they have to play or just because of the personality. The thing which annoys me really badly is the fact that main protagonist is kinda stupid. I mean for real. In my opinion, main characters of this anime are the worst part of it. Except for Koyuki which is kind of main of side characters. I believe that the whole plot would be even better in general if she had been the main character, but that's just guesses. The way the characters act is so forced that it looks like a cheap act. I think that side main characters were the best here, like Makoto or Nachi or Sara. They did a good job here and let the story flow a bit. \\n\r\nFinal result: 5\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment\\n\r\nAs I said before, first episodes are really good and they let you have fun while you watch them and that's really cool. The art is really nice for our eyes and music is really magnificent in few moments, like ending of the 6th episode - Yukihanabi has just destroyed me <3 I can say that in general only Koyuki scenes could provide me the feelings of watching something good. They weren't too candy like but they let me feel something inside. they had some deeper meaning not like the other shit here. Fan service wasn't needed here tbh but if they already did it, why not. It's not that bad but really... It wasn't needed in some scenes. \\n\r\nFinal result: 6\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Overall\\n\r\nThanks to Koyuki-chan that I could make some gifs and to Fuuka that she let me make whole 2 gifs :/ .... Better than nothing xD\\n\r\nThis anime isn't for people who knows something about relations and how the world works. If you wanna give this anime a try, do it - 10eps go ahead, no more xD The plot is simple enough that you know the ending after 3rd episode already, I don't like stuff of this kind - I need some stuff like Clannad when you watch the ending and you don't know what the heck is going on and you write to Key support to ask what was that.\\n\\n\r\nThe changes they did comparing to manga could make this anime way better. It's better than the manga in my opinion (just a bit like 0.1 points but it's better) but it could be even better and better. But it's not. What a pity :c\\n\r\nThe whole anime can be compared to a game - which has the wonderful soundtrack which moves your heart, with wonderful realistic like graphics with decent optimization, but the gameplay is so bad and actually the plot is so bad that you don't wanna play it anymore. That's how I feel about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe final score: *dum dum dum* - 6/10 \\n\r\nI think that's pretty honest rate. I would love to rate it subjectively but I can... xD \\n\\n\r\nI can recommend first 8 eps - it's truly quality stuff guys - then drop :)\\n\r\n~Kuhiro\\n",

            "content": "Fuuka is the \"sequel\"  to the anime/manga Suzuka. the connection between both works is that Fuuka is the daughter of suzuka as you can tell from the distinct blue hair, and also from the writer trying to tie in some activity with the drama and romance. in suzuka's it was about track&running and in fuuka's it is about music and being in a band. anyway the story starts of as a standard boy meets girl, boy becomes infatuated with the girl, and both of them come to like each other.later on Fuuka not knowing what to do with her future decides to pursue acareer in music due to her love of music and motivation from her friends who also join the band as well. through a series of conveniences they meet famous musicians esspically from a band they really like and get some help from them in order to be a better band, and that's about it. \\n\\n\r\nthe story itself is filled with a lot of cliches from dumb misunderstandings, love triangles, and drama for the sake of drama. the pacing also also very poor either being too slow or to fast at the wrong moments, examples are when the band breaks up and mostly regroup in the span of 1-2 episodes or how yuu leaned to play the bass in one day. the anime did a well enough job adapting the manga since the manga wasn't that good in the first place. i also applaud the studio from deviating from the manga for two reason, one being that i much rather prefer a lackluster ending rather than a disappointing one that forces you to read the manga or wait for the S2 that will probably never happen, and second is the disappointment of some people who watched it and didn't get their beloved truck-kun . other than that it's bad\\n\\n\r\n the characters are pretty much on par with mostly any average anime in a school setting, and can best written about in one sentence . even though the anime is named fuuka the main character of the show is yuu who is reclusive and spends more time on social media than with people. fuuka is the love interest and is eccentric and  a bit of a megalomaniac. koyuki is yuu's childhood friend who has a crush on him. then the rest of the band are one-note which include makoto the gay pianist, kazuya the drummer just cuz, and sara the reclusive bassist. everyone else isn't worth mentioning. there's is some development when it comes to the love triangle character but all in all feels flimsy. i would have given them points for focusing outside of school and for the characters having more ambitions than a higher grade, but it is mostly for just fuuka, and they cut the school part out making it feel irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\n strange for an anime that has music as one it's selling points is that it's pretty lacking. the soundtrack is not worth noting and forgettable. the songs that the band perform just feels like i'm listening the the songs OP multiple times (which is a decent song) although they do end up changing to different songs near the end of the show, but they never give of this impact they are trying to present. the voice acting is fine for the most part and they can sing pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nit's mostly standard from what to expect from modern anime. the character designs look decent enough, the contemporary setting backdrop looks decent enough. the animation is okay for what it is since not a lot of action really happens in the anime.\\n\\n\r\noverall- it was good production values though are pretty standard for modern anime, but the story and character are very flimsy.\\n\r\n4/10\ufeff",

            "content": "(SPOILER-FREE) To start off, I enjoy the manga very much even after all the bs the author was able to pull out of himself. I was FILLED with expectations for the anime, I was ready to hear different songs that they would sing and how much they would grow over the season. BUT NONE OF THAT HAPPENED INSTEAD WE GET TO HEAR THE OP OF THIS ANIME OVER AND OVER AGAIN LIKE IT'S SOME MASTERPIECE THAT THE STUDIO HAS SPENT SO LONG ON. There are so many flaws in this anime and a little halfway through the season THEY CHANGE THE STORY. WHAT?!?!but lets break this down.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\n Now for the first 6 or 7 episodes it was fine. Followed the manga plot line with some details left out here and there but that is to be expected. The story continues to move along swimmingly and then soon when watching a bit further into the season you start to notice certain things that play out differently or don't ever recall it happening in the manga. I sometimes would reread the manga looking for the part where it happened but could never find it. I gave it a chance and said to myself that's fine there must be a good reason for adding or removing something like that. Then those changes start to get large and larger and you can't help but wonder what's happening and you start to get nervous and wonder if they would make changes to big things such as the characters. THEN THEY ACTUALLY DO IT CHANGING THE ENTIRE STORE AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE OF EPISODES AND THE MAIN CHARACTER SUCH AS FUUKA AND YUU'S PERSONALITY START TO CHANGE FROM HOW IT IS IN THE MANGA. BUT THE THING THAT TRIGGERED ME THE MOST WAS THE LATEST EPISODE WHERE THE MANGA HAS MADE A DRASTIC TURNING POINT FOR THE ENTIRE BAND WAS REWRITTEN AND NOW THE STORY HAS JUST TURNED INTO A CLICHED ROM COM. IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THIS ANIME WON'T BE GETTING A 2ND SEASON SO THEY DECIDED TO COMPLETELY SINK THE SHIP IN AN ALL OR NOTHING MOVE ON THE BASIS THAT SOMEONE WILL LIKE THIS ORIGINAL STORY. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\n  Not much to say about the art. It is really just okay nothing great nothing bad but I have to say that the characters don't really live up to how they are presented in the manga. Would have to say Yuu's art make him seem rather scrawny then he actually is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\n You would think a anime about music and a band would have a wide variety of songs or even at least just small tad bits of different songs. NO NONE OF THAT IS IN THIS ANIME AT ALL. THE BAND SINGS AND ONLY LISTENS TO THE OP OF THIS ANIME \"CLIMBERS HIGH\" OVER AND OVER. It's not a bad op when you listen to it the first few times but it gets so boring and uninteresting as if this is the only song that exist in that universe. It makes all the important scenes where the band does play seem like it is just any other day. Incredibly disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\n  While the majority of characters remain true to how they are portrayed in the manga eventually that would change. With the anime's original story line that appears OVER HALF WAY INTO THE SEASON characters now feel like they all just hit a midlife crisis and cause unnecessary problems as a device to move the story to its finale. This anime starts to make the smallest changes in how the character acts over the first few episodes and then HIT YOU WITH A FLIPPING TRUCK LATER ON ( :^) ). NO... NO MORE OF THIS CRAP\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\n It's fine if you have nothing better to watch. I have dropped this completely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\n So many expectations for this anime and was the anime I was looking forward to in the winter but it ended up being the biggest disappointment that put me on a emotional roller coaster more then the manga did. It's so clear that the studio/production company behind this was so incredibly lazy and didn't even bother to try to make something respectable. They thought replaying the OP over and over again would force us to love it but it just makes us dread hearing it. Maybe one day things will change for the better.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright Fuuka, oh this show. After catching up with the manga, this show feels pretty rushed so far, but it's not actually bad. Here are my thoughts\r\nStory 7\r\nThe story of Fuuka is about a highschooler named Yuu Haruna that has moved into town and during a fateful day he met Fuuka, a blue haired beauty. That's it for a basic synopsis. The story of this anime isn't actually bad but more like i said rushed, they should've given more time to develop the story and make it more interesting, so far while it is pretty cliched and generic i still kind of like the storyand it keeps me invested for now.\\n\\n\r\nArt 3\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime i think is pretty fucking garbage. The movement of the characters are pretty clunky and the background are nothing special to look at, pretty disappointing since Diomedea can do pretty good animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack i think is the highlight of the anime, the opening and ending are great and the OST is pretty good to listen to as well\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6\\n\\n\r\nOther than Yuu and Fuuka everyone is pretty much a throw away character,except for Yuu's childhood friend she's pretty decent. The others though pretty bad\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8\\n\\n\r\nEven with all that i still enjoy watching the show as it is, it's a pretty good drama with a mix of music and comedy in it\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad show, it's pretty decent but i can't find myself binge watching this show again in the near future. But if you want a decent drama this should be good to fill your time",

            "content": "Fuuka started as what one might call an interesting band anime but the music is what keeps it from being cliche and cringey anime with melodrama at the top. \r\nThe story well there are alot of different things to say about the story and not much good. it throws a mash of cliche from the mcs bumping into another and pantie shots. There are just too much of it as the anime goes on and tries to tell its story. It had a potential but trying to entice the watcher by revealing skin in almost every episode isnt the way atleast for me who hopeda story based on music. It has it all everything form the childhood friend to love triangles. Althoguh it does have its own originality it doesnt have as much as i had hoped. So the story is the worst of the entire anime which is kinda funny considering that is supposed to be what an anime consist of so why in all gods names do i give it a 6 which rates as a fine anime which is borderline good.\\n\\n\r\nWell the music is what makes me want to continue to watch this and makes me wait for the next song in the next episode. This anime makes good music in a band anime that some anime struggles with which is refreshing. Great vocals /beats and plays makes me want to watch it. Problem is that the story overshadows too much of it and makes people remember the crappy story and not the great music that actually is in it. Not only thinking about the  lyrics but the music played from the instruments themselves. For real how many anime actually gives the bass some love ? Very few thats who.  \\n\\n\r\nWell the 2 main characters are pretty generic i feel. The great and open music girl and the shy and blushy boy with his half naked sisters. Not much to write home about. The cold yet interesting guitarist , the prob homosexual keyboardist and the fun and energetic drummer are alot more interesting as characters than the mains which speaks alot of the anime itself. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it to a 7 because its rare to find so much great music in one anime  and very rare at that. The melodramatic cliche story made me at times cringe but music got me through it as much else in life does for people. \\n\\n\r\nOverall its a fine anime solely based on the anime and a couple of things from the story but in the end music is all this anime will ever be for me. So eventhough i enjoyed it to a 7 almost all cause the music it doesnt deserve more than to be rated as a fine or 6 in my opinion",

            "content": "I actually disagree with most of the radically negative reviews of this anime, \r\nAlthough I do have a bias for the genre, and am capable of excusing certain flaws, I would still consider Fukka better than your average anime in the genre. \r\nId rate Fukka as a solid 6 (while id say an average anime in the genre nowadays is more like 4) \r\nThe main thing that is killing the anime like a gross parasite is the Cliches. \r\nEspecially at the start of the show, the director relies heavily on the usual frame of anime in the genre. The first episode made me cringe quitea few times and wonder if I should drop it. But the thing is, if you are able to ignore these details, they become exponentially less prominent as the show goes. \\n\\n\r\nId say that the two things that work best for this anime is the fabulous animation/character design and a plot-driving character development. This anime isnt very deep, its about a bunch of kids starting a band. The thing that is interesting to see is how the values that drive them as musicians and the personal growth the main characters go through to finally satisfy the romantic tension in the anime. Regarding the romance itself, as youd expect there would be some cliche immature moments.. but sometimes, I was surprised to see they were not as bland as they are in some other animes. sometimes the romance is even mature id say.. \\n\\n\r\nIf youre a romance anime fan with the patience to excuse a few cliches for decent character/plot development , well, I enjoyed this anime so Id recommend. \\n",

            "content": "My first MAL review, I felt like I had to justify this amazingly bad show. Not a comprehensive review by any means.\r\nTL;DR This anime is so bad to the point where it's good and you binge it twice in a row.\r\nStory 3/10:\r\nThe story is poor at best, you've seen and heard it all before - very cliche. The story has a few plot holes and way too many conveniences.\r\nFrom the start I could tell that I was going to enjoy this show, not because it's a good show by any means, but because it's sooo bad to the point where you can't stop watching it.From the cliches to the predictable story line you can anticipate everything that's going to happen and pretty much fill out the story from the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi scenes are suuuper forced but hey it's ecchi, I don't think anyone really cares to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 7/10:\\n\r\nNot much to say about this, the art and animation were ok, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\r\nTo be honest I don't really know what they mean by this, if it means the OSTs and stuff then they're fine. I love the songs that they sing in the show - or at least Fuuka's voice is great, I'd listen to her singing. The ending is ok, I wouldn't listen to it on a daily basis but it's an ok song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10:\\n\r\nHahahaha, characters... ah. They're all really bland. The best guy character has to be the gay guy though. He's the voice of reason in this shitfuck hole. Best girl is Fuuka just because there's like, 2 other girls and Fuuka is just better than both of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC is your generic, useless protagonist that messes everything up, falls in love and lives happily ever after. Fuuka is your generic female MC, blah blah, I don't want to write about this part anymore. Basically, you've seen all the characters somewhere before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nOh boy, this shit is so bad that I fucking love it. I finished watching it once and then went straight back to episode 1. It's not even a good anime to be honest I wouldn't even recommend wasting your time on this anime since you've watched parts of it before. But I had so much fun watching this anime and I believe that my \"friend\" is as well, a I am writing this he is watching the anime and ranting about how amazingly bad this show is.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously though, I actually thought this anime was super fun to watch. Objectively, it's not a good show but I had a blast watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10:\\n\r\nJust watch it and you'll understand.",

            "content": "I recently got more familiar with the music genre in anime and there are usually three paths the series follow: 1. It becomes one of the best in the medium excelling in other issues and themes the show deals with (e.g. Nana), 2. It is not great but it is decent and there seems to be some effort from the production team to make it work although they fall flat in some areas (e.g. Fukumenkei Noise) and 3. Cringe-worthy, despicable and irritating cash-grabs that have no merit at all and everything modest about the show is completely tossed out of the window. Unfortunately, Fuuka isan advocate of the last category. It is exactly on par in terriblness with BanG Dream. Only difference is that BanG Dream is just loli-shit and nothing more. I mean Fuuka tried so hard to be something else it made even the most try-hard of shows look modest, in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nLet's keep this rant short and sweet and make myself clear for the reasons why SAO, Guilty Crown and Kabaneri are much more modest in comparison than this monstrosity. First, the characters are unreal. They are exactly like walking Sims with no personality traits and their aspirations are as hollow as their heads. Fuuka is annoying as hell. She is needy, selfish and she gets what she wants in the end without any hardship to redeem herself. She is like Umaru-chan but worse, since she is portrayed as a realistic \"human being\". And Haruna is just the typical beta male that changes character when the melodrama demands it. Koyuki is a self-centered cunt who is way too thirsty for Haruna. The rest are not important. Their goals in life, their character development, their importance to the plot are non-existent. The characterization and development of characters is done only when the plot demands it and none is at least likeable or sympathetic. Not even one character is like Captain Boomerang from Suicide Squad who was the only villain who did not make me question the purpose of my life and cringe the hell out of me.  \\n\\n\r\nWell, at least the story is fair right? Hell, no! It is a cheap dramafest wirtten by people incompetent at daily life issues like love, friendship, etc. I never thought it would be good because I knew that the show could not be anything more than average when it aired and I hoped that the show would keep me entertained with its music and art.\\n\\n\r\nHah! What a joke! It even failed at doing right the one thing that anime are good for: pretty colors, good direction and music. The animation was basic as fuck. It had some nice touches here and there but it was so damn generic. It was rather inconsistent towards the end and I found the blue border lines of the characters very distracting and derpy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the music...the songs are decent but once you finish this show you will be sick of the OP song and you will have forgotten everything. And the ED is ok but forgettable nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nI still cannot understand which brilliant mastermind thought Fuuk-ya was a great idea. It is a perfect example of how to not do an anime series or a series in general. Btw, I regret ever considering this amusing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.68/10\\n\\n\r\nAlternative Recommendations:\\n\\n\r\n-Nana\\n\r\n-Fukumenkei Noise\\n\r\n-Your Lie in April",

But after one of the scene . i thought \"oh i give up, this anime is worthless to watch\". \\n\\n\r\nsometimes you have to follow the story to make it reaches is climax even though the MC may died . now that's something that the director didn't wan't to take a risk because afraid of loses rating. well the director had wrong. the story that not follow the manga is always have a bad rating from it's fans......\\n\\n\r\ni think the reason of why this anime is suck because no death scene just like the manga does. i mean what's wrong with the death? i thought death will make the story makes an open to a new beginning. at least one of the mecha anime told me about that. that death is not going to make anime itself worst but rather it giving something that is perfect.",

But hey, if you like to separate your cartoon genres and love shitty tropes, this might be for you.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else is pretty generic and straight forward. you got loud jock side character, cool but potentially gay but also omniscient best friend and big titty but mysterious side chick. Nothing out of the ordinary. Best girl definitely was a whiny little bitch but you know once you build that relationship up with the MC, it just stings my asshole with the way things happened. Fuuka is just straight trash tho.\\n\\n\r\nits pretty average in all regards, if you like the genre of cartoon then you might enjoy it. id actually rather just sit in my room and see how many grapes i can push up my asshole, but to each their own. \\n\\n\r\nbeing as generic as it is, best girl is childhood cuck girl",

            "content": "Notice: this review contains all episodes so SPOILER ALERT, but i'll try to keep it as little as possible, I'm saying this to state what I want to pin point\r\n..oh boy...this was....idk I guess I'll just state how I feel and don't worry I'll keep it short as possible. \r\nI decided to watch this anime since I thought hey this is something that is similar to beck the only similarity is they have is the band so I'll start but let's go with the positives for now and i'll make a list out of it. \r\nand also...This is an ANImE REVIEW so I'll be comparingthis to the manga because of the DIFFERENT STORY LINE\\n\\n\r\nPOSITIVES\\n\\n\r\n1. KOYUKI...my dear girl, the only reason why I kept watching fuuka, she's the best character, and heck she did all the things that she had to do (not in a yandere way of course) just for yuu, she even stated that she dedicated her SONGS almost all to him, and true she made a mistake which is normal in an anime but she tried to make up for it, and I like that she even support Fuuka at all costs even if it's because of her feelings for Yuu\\n\\n\r\n2. Of Course the Art and the Music, personally I think It's not that Bad, I like Climbers High Fair wind, probably because It's my genre, since I like Rock, and I like the designs as well, especially Koyuki Sarah and Kazuya.\\n\\n\r\n3. Though I still personally think they suck, I sort of like the personality of the band members but that's just about it. \\n\\n\r\nBUT NOW LET'S MOVE INTO THE NEGATIVES...Dum dum dum...\\n\\n\r\n1. THE ENTIRE STORY LINE SUCKS AND DRAMA WAS F****N FORCED I'll explain why\\n\\n\r\nEpsiodes \\n\\n\r\n1-4: Formation of the Band \\n\\n\r\n5-9: Koyuki's past and relationship with Yuu\\n\\n\r\n10-12: Fuuk's feelings, leaving the band then going back again.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sad Part is most of the episodes revolves around Koyuki, and her feelings for yuu was explained well, heck I even liked Yuu when he started going out with her, then i thought \"Hey this Anime route is not so bad\" but no\\n\\n\r\nout of nowhere Fuuka relaizes her love and leaves the band, then episode 11 (sorry I can't take it) yuu realizes he loves fuuka then brakes up with koyuki in less than 10 F*****N MINUTES, the the second hald talks about the SO CALLED STUGGLES OF THE BAND which i Think is not touching enough, then of course the final epsidoe where everyone is happy blah blah blah and of course yuu and fuuka lived happily ever after\\n\\n\r\nThe point is I don't mind cliches, but If you're planning to end up with fuuka then HELL THEY SHOULD JUST FOCUS MOST OF THE EPSIODES ON HER RELATIONSHIP WITH YUU DAMN IT, what's the point of all those build up with Koyuki if in less than 10 minutes it'll be thrown away like an old PS2 also the suffering of the band is forced.\\n\\n\r\nyou see series like Beck Love Live and Sound Euphonium, you can see the growth of the band or group from their humble beginings and stuggles, while here all you see is a bit of flashback of waht the bandmates did and before the episdoe ends they went back together...LIKE MAGIC\\n\\n\r\n2. The Fuuka in the manga is diffrent she's a lovable character there, unlike here in the anime.\\n\\n\r\n3. The Side characters (bandmates) pretty much suck, they got likable perosnalities but that's just it, let me mention.\\n\\n\r\nFirst Mikasa, what separeated him from teh two is that he knew fuuka for a long time and he's also gay, but the point is if he knows fuuka, are they really that close??????\\n\\n\r\nI can't remember a time when he went to fuuka's place and worse he can't even tell if Fuuka's sad or something, \\n\\n\r\nThen We got Kazuya whom I like I mean going tusdere mood on his grandma is pretty cute and for Sara to have a nice body..but that's it\\n\\n\r\n4. Truck-kun has Failed.\\n\\n\r\n5. I'm annoyed at teh fact that WHAT FUUKA WANTS FUUKA GETS..I mean just think..she wants a band she gets it, she likes yuu and Yuu falls for him, and she does acutally nothing on it, while Koyuki has only 1 goal and that is for yuu to love her, and for her to work her ass of day and night for her to build up the courage to confess to him and getting dumped in less than 10 minutes....that's gotta hurt.\\n\\n\r\n6. Yuu came from an interesting male lead to a generic mc, that so called developemnt that he has, yeah a lot of MC does that too(excpet for Ichika I guess)\\n\\n\r\noverall I gave this a 5 since despite being predictable, I like the music the art and Koyuki..hope you won't get offended this is just perosnal thoughts.",

            "content": "Fuuka is the latest anime adaptation of Kouji Seo's work, and serves as a sequel to the 2005 anime Suzuka. However, it is not necessary to watch Suzuka in order to understand Fuuka, as the plot is completely unrelated and the only real link between the two is that Fuuka is Suzuka's daughter. \r\nFuuka tells the story of Yuu Haruna, a guy who seemingly does nothing but post about his day on Twitter meeting the titular character: a crazy, strange girl who cares about nothing more than music. The two put aside their inital differences to form a band, following in the footsteps of aband they idolize. Of course, there's also a love triangle between the two and Yuu's childhood friend: an idol named Koyuki. The show attempts to juggle both plots simultaneously, but it gets pretty clumsy at times and certain things seem to come out of nowhere. Additionally, it really fails to bring much originality to the premise; this is hardly the first anime to deal with the creation of a band or include a love triangle, so there won't be a whole lot of surprises to anyone watching. The only ones who may be surprised are manga readers, as certain events are changed significantly to give this an anime original ending.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing special about Fuuka's art and animation. It works fairly well most of the time, but character design is a bit unoriginal. I don't have much to say about this aspect of the show, just that it's one of the anime's stronger points.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime about music, one would hope that Fuuka does a good job when it comes to sound. It definitely succeeds, with some very solid and catchy songs performed by the band, including the excellent OP Climber's High! However, said OP gets played a bit too much, considering it's the only song the band practices and plays initially, which gets a little annoying. The character voices are fairly decent, and although I don't really care for Fuuka's speaking voice, her excellent singing more than makes up for it. I'd say that sound is definitely the strongest point of Fuuka, but honestly that's not too difficult an achievement.\\n\\n\r\nFuuka has pretty weak, and in some cases, utterly unlikeable characters. When there's a love triangle, and a girl who's not even involved in it is a preferable option to the two who are, there's something wrong with your characters. Obviously, this is just my opinion, but Fuuka comes off as incredibly annoying for a majority of the anime, and Koyuki honestly seems utterly irrelevant, her only purpose seems to be to create conflict between band members and in general. The rest of the characters aren't much better, but even the tolerable ones suffer from a lack of development. It honestly seems like Yuu, Fuuka, and Koyuki are the only ones who get any meaningful character development, and that's a shame considering how bland I find them.\\n\\n\r\nThe only time I really cared about what was happening and looked forward to the next episode was when I read manga spoilers. Before reading the spoilers and after it became clear they were going anime original, it was really a chore to watch this week after week. The band storyline is admittedly somewhat decent, but the romances are weak and this is one of the worst love triangles I can recall, making for quite a painful watch. It's not even worth watching if you're an ecchi fan, since there's barely anything of note. Fuuka gets a couple panty shots, there's a bath scene or two, and there's one scene where Yuu's three sisters are inexplicably all in their underwear. It seems like a pathetic attempt to pander to viewers, but it really doesn't do anything more than that. \\n\\n\r\nFuuka is an exercise in medocrity, and is a good example of how to write an uninteresting romance. I won't deny that there are aspects of it that people can and will enjoy, but personally, I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone unless they desperately want to watch music related anime. Even then, there's a good half dozen I'd recommend first. This isn't the worst thing I've seen, but it's certainly no masterpiece.",

            "content": "As an anime adaptation, in my opinion; Fuuka quite managed to achieve some anime production objectives.\r\nIt fulfilling the hope of the most potential fans and saving them from depression, successfully killing the expectations of several annoying fans who continuously spoiling the show since the beginning. And more importantly; promotion for the manga; by giving curiosity; what will happen after the end, or what happen actually in the manga?\r\nStory 8/10\r\nUnlike the manga, the anime (until 12 episodes) only gives adaption about the formation of the band (FallenMoon)  and the problems arising as a result of a love triangle between characters; Fuuka Akitsuki ,Yuu Haruna andsinger Koyuki Hinashi. They made several changes for character personalities. Koyuki becomes nicer and more dumb, while Fuuka still selfish, but turn into a coward. This change causes no serious conflict between the two, thus making the story more boring. The bright side: the story of this anime version is more have an element of fairness and hopes, compared to what happens in the manga (depression). At least, the dream of some teenager girl to become a singer achieved and not snatched away by something unexpected. \\n\\n\r\nMusic - Sound 9/10\\n\r\nThis is personal taste, this anime have good song and sound track for me. \\n\\n\r\nArt - Animation 7/10 \\n\r\nI quite disappointed, since the anime art for character look more childish. Manga art still better. But i am ok with this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nContinuation\\n\r\nThe anime able to reach the save point where you thought all already solved with clear resolution in the last scene, but actually still have the opportunity to give more story in the next season or OVA. Yes, it's because, the result of the ending of this anime still same with the manga in certain point. Especially, for: who ended up with who, in the last scene. And the manga still have more stories about them. So, the second season and second coming of Truck-kun actually possible .... maybe. :D",

            "content": "Before reading this review, please know that I have not read the manga and have no interest in reading it. I've seen some reviews bashing the anime because it did not follow the manga step by step. Maybe I'd agree with them if I knew the original story but honestly I do not care. This is a review on the anime, not a review on how it compares to the manga. \r\nStory: 5\r\nFuuka tells the story of a timid high school student, Yuu Haruna who is absolutely obsessed with Twitter, constantly tweeting his thoughts and activities. One day while out, fate plays its role whenYuu bumps into our main female of the story, Fuuka Akitsuki. What begins as two school mates stuck in a bundle of misunderstandings quickly turns into a band of talented friends who decide to chase dreams of stardom. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the music aspect of this show seems overshadowed by drama that only high school students would have so instead of witnessing the rise of rock stars, I saw mere speckles of light walking on rocks. There is an emphasis of romance highlighted throughout the show but I found it frustrating and typical. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art style, little amazes me but nothing disappoints because I had no expectations. The most eye catching moments were when the band performed which is always nice to see in an anime about music. Settings do very little as I sometimes forgot whether the group were in a garage or cafe. All in all, pretty average.\\n\\n\r\n Sound: 6\\n\\n\r\nIt does take a while to witness the true sounds (meaning the band performing) in the show. As I listened to the songs you first encounter, I thought everything was okay. Fuuka's singing does throw me off because of how different she sounds but it's pretty common when you are trying to produce a noise that sounds pleasant so I got over it. When I got far enough into the story, I did replay some performances as I thought they were catchy. All in all, the music I did hear was the type I could vibe with; even though I always skipped passed the opening and ending for the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nEh. I don't hate any of the members of the band but I gotta say that the two MC's, Fuuka and Haruna are my least favorite. I found it very sad because they did it to themselves. Instead of just focusing on what really mattered, these two gave me such headaches as they ignored problems and kept their emotions bottled up. If you told me they weren't in high school I wouldn't believe you. As for the rest of the band members and famous pop stars that you see, I had no problem with their characters. If it wasn't for them, I would've lost interest long ago. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nI'm trying to convince myself that I liked the show but I can't help but be relieved about finishing this mess. It actually started off okay and I was genuinely interested in it too but that spark of interest quickly died as with each week came a new episode. I probably would like the manga more but I still have no cares for it, even after the show's conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nI do know that if this show focused more on the music side of things and less on the high school love drama, I would've enjoyed it a bit more. The story, art, and sound was all okay but none of it was enough to really feed my appetite for entertainment. I thought this was going to be a great show so that's probably why I kept at it. Oh well, on to the next one. \\n",

Another week passed and I felt the same way so much so that I did something I had never done before; I jumped to reading the manga. I read the manga to chapter 80 before the next episode was out. \r\nWhile I noted small changes the anime made, early on, I didn't have any idea how drastic the deviation from the manga would be I ended up reading so much of the manga that Iwas eagerly waiting for events to occur in the anime. I got upto date on the manga release (148 chapters) before this anime finished season 1 and I have to say that the manga is way better.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga has maybe 4+ seasons worth of Fuuka the animation and while drastically different and at times very sad, it is much better. I think I rated this anime higher than I should have, but that is because the manga lends appeal to it. While this show might really be a 6, the manga is a 9. \\n\\n\r\nI'm glad I finished it, but I won't watch the second season, it would just bring down my feelings for Fuuka the Manga; the 1st manga I have ever read.",

You'll more than likely know how things are going to play out well in advance which may ruin the entire series for you. \r\nFor me, personally, I came into things to see how the transition from sports to music wouldbe.  I'm personally more of a fan of music Animes than sports.  I really enjoyed the sound track of the series and the band aspect which brought me more enjoyment than most of those that have high reviews.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show feels much faster in pace than Suzuka and aspects of the story feel rushed.  Again, while a lot of things are predictable, I find that in most Animes that is the case to begin with.  For me it's simply how much I can still enjoy the series.  The art was clean visually.  While nothing in particular stood out, I didn't go into the series thinking there would be spectacular landscapes or colorful displays.  The story and characters do not carry so much weight on their own.  If you don't enjoy music in Anime, this may not be the best follow up series for you.  On the other hand, the music aspect is part of what gave the series a 8/10 for me.",

This is an amazing anime if anything for the songs alone, that immediately bumps this anime to a 10 just because of the music. I'm not saying its the best anime out there and it has its cliches but if your into romance and music this anime is for you (just dont follow it up with the manga because u wont like it lol ). Most reviews are based solely off of past animes and/or comparisons to ANY amazing animes. So if your like me andhate those kind of opinions and want to watch an anime and look at it as its own thing without comparing it to others then this anime is for you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy! :)\\n\\n\r\nP.S. i know my grammar sucks but ive been out of school for awhile now and i dont practice it so forgive me if i made several errors XD",

Despite animation issues, unnecessary fan-service, and occasionally questionable dialogue I enjoyed the story and characters in the show enough to keep watching through to the end.

It's the \"human/anime\" body, grow up.  \r\n   Besides that, it is the typical \"boy has 2 girls that like him but as usual he is completely oblivious and finds it surprising even though they make it pretty obvious they are into him\" sort of show.  Besides that partit is a pretty decent show, not one I would re-watch, but that doesn't say much as most of the ones I have seen I wouldn't re-watch. \\n\\n\r\n   If you need a show to watch for background noise as you play video games or clean the house, it is a good show for that.

Though I cried reading the manga, I was glad to see the anime had a different outcome. Manga was just fucking sad. \r\nStory\r\n------\r\nHonestly the story is just complete cliche that anyone could write this kind of story, but this is the kind of anime where you want to see something cliche and to be expected (I mean, that's what I thought of when I wanted to watch it). The drama is just so normal andthe romance is what not like every other anime. I don't really like to criticize things because even though the story wasn't too good, the writer had at least tried to make us enjoy his work. So the story is pretty damn cliche that is all I have to say and you should watch it if you want to see some cliche anime where you can predict what's gonna happen. In my opinion, this story is way better than Suzuka.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nArt style is fine in my opinion. I've always liked anime girls that have a more of a 'tomboy' kind of personality (like short hair and not shy and stuff but is still a girl inside). There is not much to explain here, since the props drawn are like every other anime out there. Unique art styles would be like Honobono log etc. \\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nThe opening is great, I mean, the anime is kinda about music so what can I say? The voice acting is fair, not shabby. And I really don't know what else I am gonna say here.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nI don't know, I haven't seen this anime in a while, but I think the male MC's personality could've been better, I mean, it relates to the story so what can I say? I'm kinda unsatisfied with most of their personalities. \\n\r\n4/10\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nI can't really give this anime under 5/10 since I never felt hate towards the plots or anything just unsatisfaction. It is different to the kind of satisfaction to when there is a cliffhanger, I have this unsatisfaction where the anime could have been better. i mean, I feel like I should rate it 3/10 and below when the anime just has a very shitty plot and I go around talking to myself saying things like 'what the fuck? that was just fucking stupid'. This anime just made me go 'meh, kinda expected' So in the end I enjoyed it but still needs work so that it could've gotten a greater rating. \\n\r\n6/10",

Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nThe main complaint I have with the story is that it felt oddly fast paced. And how some of drama was quite unnecessarily self-destructive.\r\nBut aside that I did quite enjoy the story. The touch of a bit awkward characters was nice, there was fair amount of drama and feels and as well characters did grow in a sense and as well got their \"changes of life paths\" . So overall, story did feel good, but it did not feel too impressive. I'll be honest that I didbinge watch, yet still lost focus now and then. \\n\\n\r\nI seriously don't know what else to say. That is the general gist of what I felt about the story aspect. Rest is basically for viewer itself to experience and feel, if it ends up being up their alley.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nArt&Animation was simple and fitting enough. But what I want to mention here, is fanservice. Usually fanservice is for hotness, lewdness or comedic reason. But this Anime fanservice felt for some reason very beautiful and natural. I cannot explain exactly, but I can tell rather than the usual service for some eye candy or blood rush or humor ...it seriously felt refined and simply just normal and calming. So that to that.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, I did quite enjoy. 2 of their songs were kinda meh, rest were really enjoyable. On top of that OST was also quite nice.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nI honestly don't want to write too long, as I have to say quite a few things regarding some characters, but I'll skip that and keep it short as possible.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all MC is awkward, shy and timid which I really liked, mostly because saw lot of myself in him. But of course, since it's a romance anime, he has bunch of characters who are in love with him. So yeah, damn lucky fellow. Nevertheless, how love interest and simple experiences gave him a push and positive changes was a nice thing to see. \\n\\n\r\nNot fond of Fuuka herself. But overall she was a good character. With a little bit confusion drama.\\n\\n\r\nKoyuki is a very adorable and sweet character, but feel really bad for her. I cannot explain why, as it would be bunch of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\n Iwami was probably my favorite character. She is an absolute beauty with such an adorable personality. Utterly my type of character.\\n\\n\r\nThere were bunch of other worthwhile characters, but as said. I have something to say to pretty much whole cast, which I want to avoid to do. But that also means, that I did quite enjoy characters, thus why have so many thoughts on them.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nGood music, nice drama, good romance, interesting characters made it overall really good Anime, but at the same time I felt the pacing was too fast, which made some of the drama and development just simply odd. So at some point it simply became quite a pain to follow of what was happening or who was feeling what. So that why my enjoyment was kinda \"eh...nice enough I guess\".\\n\\n\r\nBut all things considering it was very enjoyable Anime.",

Personal growth in between the characters and the way the cliches were portrayed including the love triangle was entertaining, to be honest I cried (don't know why)...it was a very touching ending. When it comes to slice of life I kinda of get bored, but I don't know, here I found myself entertained in the lives of eachcharacter. Even though the first encounter between the MC's was so cliche for ecchi/harem anime, it was funny as hell. Of course as a sucker for romance anime my credibility can be low and even ignored; I even don't watch music genre anime, to be honest this is only the second one of the genre I've watched (after Shigatsu wa Kimi Uso), for some reason it just got to me on so many levels that I couldn't even explain. I know people have been giving it terrible readings due to huge amount of cliches predictable scene plots but still it wouldn't hurt to give it a try...maybe you'll even enjoy it as much as I did.\\n",

So to me they rushed the story to get the anime out skipping a ton of chapters. for future reference if the story in the manga is relevant to the story for the anime don't skip anything.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nThe art is amazing in this anime and it was a good watch and easy on the eyes with all the detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nWhat can I say I love music which is the main component of the anime is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nSee story for my explanation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :10\\n\\n\r\nI have watched it a couple of times and enjoy the music 10/10 and it was a good watch.\\n\\n\r\noverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime lacks a good storyline and does not follow the manga (tsk tsk) to me it should it would allow for better character development also would allow for fuuka aoi to make her appearance and steal yuu's heart. but in all I will give an opinion he is better off with Koyuki Hinashi. \\n",

Since this has music as one of its genres I was still unsure, but hey YOLO. Anyway I got the general of the show before it started.\r\nStory: It started off with two of the most clich\u00e9 scenarios that could happen, running into senpai and accidently looking at a girl in the wrong area of her body, really? The originality is lacking, but I kept going. After that we are going into the house of our Male lead, Yuu. Nothing really happens aside from him dealing withfamily. When he gets to school the next day he has to deal with the same stuff with senpai (Fukka). It\u2019s as if the writers got in a loop. After that tsundere moment again Fukka gets a heart change the next day because Yuu just happened to tickets to a concert to her favorite singer. Honestly the mood swings in the show are so weird. So later on the idea of making band came in and I was just like nope. The romance in the how was the end factor. There is a love triangle and it was so obvious how it would end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nYuu: He is shy and quiet guy who loves twitter and does not have many friends. I like him for he actually does his best through the show to be a better him. \\n\\n\r\nFukka: The reason I stopped watching. She came off as a jerk and then as weird mood swings a times. She is selfish and the plot caters to her like crazy. It is abad thing when the name of the show is what ruins it.\\n\r\nKoyuki: She is the childhood friend of Yuu and I was rooting for her and Yuu, but Fukka said no to that. She is very werid when Yuu mentions Fukk a and does not try to listen to Yuu after he tries to defend himself. But still I like her better than Fukka.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone Else: The others are pretty likable and don\u2019t hinder the story or the quality of it.\\n",

Now that I have finished the show, I am glad I watched it as it did provide me with 10/10 enjoyment. The story of this anime isn't the best and some events do look forced and needed to be developed and worked on better.  However, If you are just a casual viewer, the flaws to the story could be easily ignored. That being said, many events are difficult to be explained and are mostly lead up to from different coincidences.\r\nIf you are able to ignorethen flaws to the story, you will for sure love this anime. This anime includes a love triangle between 2 females and one male, best part is that the male main not only shares romantic experiences with both of them, he chooses one of them at the end. There are a lot of drama included and also a little bit of mystery with the band \"HEDGEHOG\" which sadly never really gets answered (one of the flaws to the story). \\n\\n\r\nOfcourse, this is also a music anime. I would rate the music 10/10, but that is just from someone who isn't very familiar with what good anime music sounds like. To me, it sounded pretty good. No high pitched vocalized sound, good rhythms and decent lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this anime if you are just a casual anime viewer. However, if you are someone who likes to criticize the animes you watch, then you will surely find some issues with the story. Regardless to that, I enjoyed watching this very much and would definitely watch the second season of this if there were (not gonna happen ever but you can atleast hang on to a little hope) \\n",

That being said I found the main love interests to be interesting and entertaining however due to the show only receiving 12 episodes a lot was crammed into 24 minute episodes resulting in far less story and character development that could have been done for all the characters had they had 26 episodes like original series Suzuka had received. The art in this anime is up to par with pretty much all 1080p anime today.   Where I enjoyed themost out of this show outside of Fuuka was the music. Watching the show made me want to discover the name of the songs and purchase them. To me if you're on the fence I suggest watching a few episodes at least before you decide to skip on the show.",

            "content": "*sigh* Spoiler warnings just in case, not sure what all I'm gonna get into with this review. I think I did a good job of avoiding any actual spoilers but it never hurts to be safe\r\nStory: 1/10 Why? Because this story isn't Fuuka. It's \"Well we have a slot to fill so let's take this manga and fit it into 12 episodes by taking out 90% of the actual plot and replacing it with cliches, standard love triangle, and completely reroute romances and plot so we can end it neatly on ep 12 with no expectation of a second season\"...\r\nArt: 7/10 Pretty standard art work,nothing to complain about on the animation side of things though I'm not particularly picky about those sorts of things.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 Those songs I've been reading about but never actually got to know any words FINALLY comes to actual audio form! I couldn't be more excited about that! And they did a good job of living up to the hype I had for the songs. Now if only more than 1 song was created...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10 Right so, this one is pretty heavily effected by the story rating. Because the plot was thrown out the window and replaced so to were the characters, well, character. Fuuka was a rather deep and influential character (no shit sherlock,  her name is literally the title) but was turned into a wishy washy mess and lost any sense of personality that made her character great in the manga. Same goes for Yuu the MC.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10 Pretty self explanatory at this moment... They took a story I was looking forward too and completely bastardized it. Did you happen to watch Girlish Number? Maybe a season before this show released. Yeah, the dipshits in the production staff (inside the show not the ones who actually made it) were actually real people. And they decided to make Fuuka...\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10 And I feel like I'm being nice with that rating...\\n\\n\\n\r\nI sincerely hope this wonderful story will one day get an actual adaption...",

            "content": "Let\u2019s start off with something completely clear. Wall of text ahead.\r\nThe anime and the manga follow a completely different trail at some point\u2026 is it bad\u00a0?\r\nYes and no\u2026 let me explain. When you see some anime, you simply get completely frustrated about the ending, because it ends in such an akward way you would have to read the manga to fully enjoy the next step\u2026 (something along the lines of Btoom\u2026) But it does follow the manga\u2026 leaving you with that weird taste after completing the anime...\r\nSo at this point, you either have to do yourself a favor and start to think a bit differentlyor pass your way\u2026\\n\r\nI will, due to that, instore a\u00a0rule\u2026 one single rule :\\n\r\nRule #1 - Simply pass your way and save yourself precious lifetime IF...\\n\\n\r\nDo it differently\u00a0: take the anime as a separate material, and completely disconnect it from the manga\u2026 It\u2019s really an adaptation. The manga is NOT the script of the anime...\\n\r\nStill not sold to admit an anime and a manga could have a different story ending while the start or base material is the same\u00a0? Then simply go read the manga\u2026 and read rule #1\\n\r\n[Simply pass your way and save yourself precious lifetime IF\u2026 Still not sold to admit an anime and a manga could have a different story ending while the start or base material is the same] got the idea of how to make it work right\u00a0?\\n\\n\r\nNow, about the standard bashing\u00a0: let\u2019s look at the tags this anime has\u2026\\n\r\nDrama, Ecchi, Music, Romance, School\u2026 I\u2019ll simply forget about the shounen, as it\u2019s not that important for the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nSo first off\u2026 yes Ecchi\u2026 what would be ecchi without it\u2019s dose of fan service\u00a0and pantyshots ? So again, either you are into ecchi style or not, and if shots of panties and other usual ecchi scenes bother you to this extend, use rule #1. Now let\u2019s make it clear, it\u2019s not integrated to the anime\u2026 it\u2019s clearely the same into the manga\u2026\\n\\n\r\nRomance and Drama\u2026 well sorry to say, but romance and drama stories have been filling our world for thousands of years\u2026 and funnily enough they ALL follow the same standards and paterns\u2026 so yes, put those 2 together and at some point you will have already seen all stories and developpements, it just all depend of how many have you seen or not\u2026 very hard to re-invent the wheel isn\u2019t it\u00a0? So yes, this story use the everyday standards about drama and romance\u2026 it has been a receipe that worked for as long as humanity has written tales and stories. Oh and do yourself a favor\u2026 understand the difference between the meanings of drama and dramatic\u2026 drama does not necessarly need to be dramatic\u2026 Drama is a genre, while dramatic is a situation...\\n\r\nSo finally, the saying is, \u00ab\u00a0if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it...\u00a0\u00bb\u2026 and it\u2019s true for each genre out there\u2026 so either you are ready to admit this fact and you want to see a romance/drama anime, or you are already fed up to have witnessed so many of those and then apply rule #1\\n\\n\r\nMusic and School\u2026 there, funnily enough I find that this anime is a bit different than the ones usually using those 2 tags together. Let\u2019s be clear it will not make the story any better or worse\u2026 just a different flavor\u2026 They will not only use the school environement to fullfill their dreams. Just a bit of fresh air\u2026\\n\\n\r\nNow that we are done with the tags, and just for that you should know if you give it a chance or not, we can dip into what many discuss the less\u2026 the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory\u00a0: 8\\n\r\nWait what\u00a0??? why so high\u00a0? Well there are so many things that goes either unnoticed, completely disregarded or completely overlooked into this anime that I personally think it\u2019s a shame to see how many can\u2019t even see it\u2026\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, this is a sequel to Suzuka\u2026 and due to that, many still do not bother to watch it and simply completely misunderstand the very first ecchi scene and why it\u2019s there\u2026\\n\r\nFuuka\u2019s parents\u2026 their sport background\u2026 and a bit of DNA is into Fuuka\u2026 so this scene in which she simply jump over the hurdle\u2026 and the animation is quite clear, it\u2019s really a perfect movement of a a 110 metres hurdles\u2026 and she does it simply.. because it\u2019s somewhat fun to her\u2026 it\u2019s not just there because it has to be there to prepare the ecchi scene, it\u2019s the ecchi scene that is there because of that element\u2026 what fun would there be if the scene simply had Fuuka jumping over that, and having everyone looking at her pursuing her way\u00a0without any stumble ???\\n\\n\r\nThen the twitter thing, well for once, refreshing to have the full name and not a freaking generic name that everybody will simply say or think over the anime name anyway\u2026 I think there again many overlook the message that the mangaka drop there\u2026 maybe it\u2019s time to think a bit\u00a0??? I\u2019m an old moron\u2026 and I simply utterly disrespect any FaceBook and Twitter things\u2026 Just for that matter I can simply fall in love with Fuuka\u2026 but still I really like that the Mangaka simply use it as a tool to question the good and bad of those modern communication tools and what they can instigate\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe extended use of cellphones... I\u2019m born and grown in a timeframe where we used to give ourselves a meeting point and hour, and simply stick to it and not having to use a phone to find ourselves while still in such a proximity from each other that if you witness real world today\u2019s actions, you simply facepalm to see how many peeps find themselves phoning or texting each other to find out they could really make eye contact\u2026 would they have risen their eyes out of that dumb phone screen\u2026 I have been grown in a world where you would look at things through your eyes, not through a diminishing rectangle that simply display in a shitty small screen what your eyes could see at a way wider range\u2026 and finally that\u2019s probably what goes completely disregarded the most in this story\u2026 because many are bound to live like Yuu\u2019s vision of today\u2019s world\u2026 Fuuka sees the world way differently many does those days.\\n\\n\r\nSo sorry, yes story fulfill something way deeper than many want to really admit.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the music writing part\u2026 Many seems to completely misunderstand how sometimes music works\u2026 some great songs were composed in a very short amount of time\u2026 Maybe not in a night, but some in a few days and some in a span of a few weeks at the most,  sometimes in a studio while in a pause during an recording of an album, and a song that was unexistant at the start of the work simply makes it through the final album, some composed on a coach or on the patio during a hot summer night or next to a fire place on a cold winter evening\u2026 Some of the great songs did not really take that long to be composed\u2026 I\u2019ll not do your homeworks here, but let\u2019s just simply drop some titles\u2026 Smoke on the water, You really got me, My generation\u2026 Oh wait what ??? I know right\u2026 they are old songs\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nWhat usually takes time is the arrangements and the studio work\u2026 and again, there the anime is too short to show that difference, while we witness it on the manga\u2026 so yes a basic song like Fuuka does in a night\u2026 plausible\u2026 because music very often follow exactly that path that many dislike the most about this story\u2026 standards and very well known patterns\u2026 and the songs that usually have the biggest impact on standards music listeners are not the complex ones...\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, yes of course many situations are generic situations, some more unreal than others and it\u2019s not a masterpiece plot, at least for what we are given into the anime\u2026 There are so many things that we are just witnessing the embryonic state in the anime and that will make sense or be usefull only later into the manga\u2019s story\u2026 so yes there are some frustrating things\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nArt\u00a0: 8\\n\r\nWell I really like the chara design, I find them really putting into life what we have into the manga, but honnestly, for an anime that still revolve around music, those are by far not the best animations out there for that matter. Other than that, it\u2019s the standard we are used to see those days. Nothing great, but good enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound\u00a0:7\\n\r\nWell there it hurts a bit\u2026 for an anime that revolves around music and that is inspired from a manga.. clearely while not beeing bad, the songs will never really make any of my playlists\u2026 they are simply way too generic. For that one, Fuuka in my eyes completely miss the opportunity to be better\u2026 There you will not find those great cute things K-On does, nor what White Album creates\u2026 you will not have the emotions you find into Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso nor Hibike Euphonium\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\u00a0: 9\\n\r\nWell there it\u2019s hit or miss\u2026 Either you fall in love with energetic, optimistic tornado that Fuuka is, or you don\u2019t\u2026 and it\u2019s clerely where this anime makes it or not for you\u2026 I just like what she represent, her way of thinking, how she lives somewhat appart from today\u2019s world\u2026\\n\\n\r\nNow, the probably most problematic one\u2026 Yuu\u2026 If you simply dislike the passive male heroes, you will simply hate him\u2026 to the point you will not really enjoy that anime probably\u2026 so if you find yourself needing a strong male hero\u2026 apply rule #1. \\n\r\nHe\u2019s not that bad, it\u2019s just the anime part\u2026 he really doesn\u2019t shine until way later in the maga\u2026 if he does ever shine by the way\u2026 I\u2019m used to that, I can live with it, I usually like anime for the female heroes anyway, and I usually truely dislike the usual male hero stereotype that can carry it all without crying\u2026 But he somewhat reminds me of a Jim Morrisson so unsure of himself on the beginnings and that finally is remembered as a great charismatic face of music...\\n\\n\r\nThe other protagonists, again, yes, really some standards and cliche ones\u2026 but again, they just get better in the manga\u2026 and really not that much into the anime\u2026\\n\\n\r\nStill Fuuka gets so high into my heart, that I can\u2019t go lower for that note.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement\u00a0: 10\\n\r\nYes I really enjoyed watching it. I found it refreshing and it left me with a good taste at the end\u2026 enough so I got to read the manga.. and that\u2019s clearely the point of this anime\u2026 make so you get into the manga if you want to really find out what was the difference between the 2\u2019s\u2026 and it reached that goal\u2026 at least for me\\n\\n\r\nOverall\u00a0: 8\\n\\n\r\nYes, because what I really like finally, IS the difference between the manga and the anime\u2026\\n\r\nThe manga could survive and achieve it\u2019s goal with the story it has\u2026 as it is\u2026 all dramatic that it is\u2026 And the messages it carries can stand it\u2026 and be enjoyable\u2026\\n\r\nHowever, the anime could simply not survive and fulfill it\u2019s goal should it had sticked to the manga plotlines\u2026 the anime would really be a salty one, a bitter one, leaving you completely empty if it had the storyline the manga has and kept it in a one season stand as it will probably be the case\u2026\\n\r\nSo the anime achieve something different\u2026 Beeing a pleasant one on it\u2019s own\u2026\\n\r\nA watchable anime, not great, but not as bad as many want to make it be\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSo will you get hit by a tornado called Fuuka\u00a0? Or not\u00a0?\\n\r\nIf yes, will you take it a step further and face the harsh story of the manga\u00a0?\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, and sorry for misspelling, english is not my mother tongue\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nAfter finishing Suzuka I was hoping that Fuuka was better and by God was it so much better and after finishing it, it has made me look forward to other music anime's in the future.\r\nThe story begins when Yuu Haruna is randomly walking through town looking at Twitter when suddenly a random girl called Fuuka bumped into him and suddenly these two along with other people would begin a musical career.\r\nEven though there were some elements from Suzuka that were reused like the love triangle between Haruna, Fuuka and Koyuki, but the difference is that these reused elements were done better far betterin fact and I really enjoyed the band when they got together, worked together on creating the music and it was just really fun watching these characters grow until Fuuka decided to make a decision that almost cost the anime the score I gave it, but luckily it was fixed in the end which narrowly saved it which for anyone who has read the manga you will probably be disappointed because some things are changed for the 12 episode length.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were far better than the characters that were in Suzuka, Fuuka unlike her mother was a very energetic, passionate, determined and incredibly adorable character she stole the show for me, Haruna was actually decent for a male MC though there were a few points where he did some mistakes a lot like Yamato, then there is the other band members Mikasa a homosexual (which is actually refreshing) keyboardist, Sara the Guitarist who could've been another Tsundere, but ended up being almost as adorable as Fuuka and Kazuya the drummer who really liked to whine a lot these characters were done well and had great chemistry, then theres Koyuki who to me is the weakest character of the show, she felt like a new version of Honoka but wasn't done as well which is why I couldn't support the Haruna and Koyuki relationship, but most of the characters were done well.\\n\\n\r\nThe Romance was actually fun there were a good number of moments between Fuuka and Haruna that you wanted to say \"awww\" at like some of the moments during the beach episodes and when they were creating the band they just really clicked for me and then Koyuki came in and in some ways ruined it her relationship with Haruna didn't feel right it felt forced so I was glad when they broke up and it focused back on Fuuka and Haruna.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the music aspect it was good, but they reused the same track a good number of times and didn't use new ones until the final episodes so that kinda annoyed me this would've been worse if I didn't like the soundtrack, but luckily it didn't so it didn't bother me that much.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're someone who recently came from Suzuka then this will definitely be worth watching or if you're looking for a good Romance/Music anime then you've also come to the right place, but if you had read the manga for this anime then I'd be alert since there are some things that have been changed, honestly to me though I thought it was actually pretty good",

            "content": "Fuuka is a very relaxing and soothing anime with a story that'll keep pulling you emotionally, with music, drama, school and romance as it's genre it managed to combine teenage romance and drama with music. Fuuka is also one of few anime with a female protagonist. The story is about a very talented musician who didn't realize she was until she meet a guy who happened to go to the same high school with her, he persuaded her and she agreed to start singing. The girl being spontaneous, self-centered and caring formed a band by forcing the members even if some of them doesn't knowmuch about the instrument they'll be playing. Well it's just like a simple slice of life, school, and musical anime at first glance but add romance, love triangles, drama, jealously to the picture and it becomes an anime filled with emotional scenes that might even burst you to tears. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art work of fuuka is clearly beautiful, brightly coloured and entertaining, I'm serious the art work is an (8.5/10). But hey don't take my word for it check it out. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs you already know by now, this anime is a musical anime combined with romance so it's only natural that the soundtrack would be touching. At every scene good, bad or ugly, the soundtrack was always there to bring out the best in it thereby making the sad scenes sadder and happy scenes appear happier. Well you'll understand this when you watch it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFuuka took good care of it's characters. If you ask me the character development and the attention given to all of them, no one was left behind. Even if it had some cliche characters it still was fun to watch what would happen next. With that I give it an (8/10) rating. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you ever want to try a romantic anime filled with drama and music, give fuuka a shot you wouldn't regret it. Because I enjoyed it to the point I'm giving it an (8.5/10) rating because like I said earlier the emotional aspect of the anime would keep pulling you to the next scene and you would love it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy overall for this anime would be an (8/10) rating because even if the drama in the anime is great, it's filled with cliche it's like entering a site filled with ads, it also has no remarkable plot twist. Well if you can overlook all these things you would find fuuka to be very interesting too. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Unfortunately, the English voice actors don't feel right for the characters that they are supposed to be playing.\r\nPlot points come too quickly, and not enough character development. It seems slightly unnatural and spontaneous. The producers should've opted for a 26 episode format like the prequel \"Suzuka\" \r\nIf they had it would feel more like a completed product rather than an attempt. \r\nCharacters are believable, yet how quickly they decide things or change their mind on topicsleaves an unnatural feeling, like there was a jump-cut between scenes.",

Glad when see Koyuki's voice match with picture - better than others.\r\nThe good thing is, musics from this anime was awesome, so I have all of it.\r\nI hope will hear when Yuu singing, because - you know in the manga he is singing, right. But he didn't, so it was bad thing.\r\nI like Koyuki chara instead of Fuuka in this anime, don't know why.\r\nThe art was... like the manga, but often Ifeel it didn't as smooth as other anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not expecting the second season.",

            "content": "So Fuuka, a good old music based rom com that is kind of pretty, sounds kind of nice, that has some fun characters etc etc. Long story short it's a fine and a somewhat simplistic but ultimately quite enjoyable show. (spoiler: read manga instead)\r\nWhen I watched the first two episodes I noticed that I really enjoyed the look and feel of the show, basic romcom with somewhat fun characters, with a touch of music and no focus on fanservice which is right up my alley. Since I'm more of a bingewatcher and only a couple of episodes were out I checked out the manga outof curiosity. I got hooked and like most people was quite taken by the big tonal shift. Some people disliked it, I personally loved what it did to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThen after binging the manga I came back the next week to follow up with the show. Of course I already knew what would happen but still wanted to follow suit. But some things became apparent, the songs sounded good but the concerts really lacked in intensity (visually). The story progressed but the pacing felt a tad too slow, nd by being slower some clich\u00e9s became a bit more apparent than in the manga since I could just brush over it.\\n\\n\r\nBut I still enjoyed it casually as expected until 3 quarter of the way through the show when something weird started to happen. It started to deviate from the story of the manga, love triangle seemed to have different outcome, critical tonal shift didn't happen, etc etc. Some people got annoyed, but I got excited. An alternative story seemed intersting as long as it was as good as the original.\\n\\n\r\nBut then came the major flaw, right before the end they took everything back  it seemed to have been a big curveball and the series ends right before where the tonal shift would've happened. So it seems that they justed added  some material to stretch the story out so they wouldn't have to deal with the tonal shift in the first season. (even though I don't expect to ever see a season 2) That was honestly a big dissapointment, and makes the studio look like a bunch of cowards imo. \\n\\n\r\nEither way would have been fine but they didn't commit, in the end I liked the show a lot initially, it introduced me to a manga that I love now but ended up by dissapointing me at the end. But overall it's still a good watch I just strongly recommend the manga over its adaptation.",

The characters were never fully developed enough to interact with one another the way they did, and the heroine seemed more like a spoiled kid than a love interest. Honestly, I felt like no one had the right to be in love with anyone else in this show because they never really knew one another. It felt like they pursued each another only because it was expected of them and that kind of made itboring. That's not to say its not enjoyable at all though. If you take the time to watch it, it's certainly entertaining, if only because it's fun to bash on the characters as you watch, but it will still leave a bad aftertaste.",

            "content": "This is my first review so here goes:\r\nThis anime is a cliched anime, from beginning to end. A normal antisocial boy meets a cheerful girl and they do something 'amazing' together and fall in love. Granted. However I don't feel this anime deserves so much hate and here is why. (Try bearing with me on this one)\r\nThe music that it was based around was very good, it was full (enough) of meaning and it was quite catchy.\r\nThe characters are not bad within themselves. Their design was good, they had a part to do in their roles and it fit the anime.\r\nThe anime had a directionand it went towards it, many anime just did things for the sake of it without actually having a reason for it.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all this, this anime does have it's flaws. For me it can be summed up in one thing. The anime tries too hard to become popular, so it had a lot of great ideas that it hinted at but didn't fully execute. Some of the examples are:\\n\\n\r\nThe HEDGEHOG band's reunion. Ok so the famous band that everyone in the anime idolized got back together ... and then nothing happened. They never interacted with each other, they never showed any significance in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe 'couples toy tag' thing that started the relationship didn't actually do anything throughout the anime. If they just sent the tag with the letter or something I would be happy with why they included the damn thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe pianist. This is the only thing I truly disliked about the anime. He is a good character, had a backstory, has a unique identification through the fact he was gay, but nothing else. They didn't do anything with the smarts he had, nothing with the family problems and backstory he has. Nothing. I feel they wanted to keep him for a spin off or ova story line or something. Wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nSo that is my opinion and I truly don't believe this is a bad anime by any account.\\n\r\n(By the way, I personally rated this anime as an 8 only because it has a rating of 6.9 that i don't believe it deserves. I think it deserves a 7ish that's why I rated 8)",

Every song in this series was absolutely beautiful and performed excellently which is what most music themed animes lack. Every time a song started I was pumped andexcited. This series is what music animes should strive to be giving a good mix of music and story, enough so it makes sense. \\n\\n",

I didn't enjoy this anime as I could predict what was going to happen next, and the plot was kind of mediocre and cringy to say the least. The romance was kind of forced, as if they desperately needed a harem genre to the story. Overall, I give this a5 in terms of all of these points.",

I do think the Anime did the right thing in Episode 10 with the same plot twist. If they were going to keep to the manga they should have had the plot twist around the end of episode 3. This would perhaps have benefited the anime by tightening it up which it very much needs. But I also don't mind the anime story arc, what I do dislike is the characterizations of Yuu and Fuuka and flat pacing. Fuuka early onwas a much more interesting and dynamic person. I also don't see her as the sort who would make the choice she did at the end of episode 10. Yuu strikes me as too bland a character to generate so much romantic tension amongst the female mcs. In fact this particular love triangle is really detrimental to the story and just not needed. Its slowing it down and detracting from what could have been a pretty good anime about music, the music industry and the creative and personality tensions of a band perhaps on the cusp of fame. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story isn't terribly realistic to begin with (and I find the characters often act in unrealistic ways) it could have been more successful with a different focus than poorly paced melodrama. It's not a bad anime, just a mediocre one. I do like the music.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

(btw this does not follow the source material if you're coming for there)\r\nskipping to characters, this show portrays Fuuka as the most selfish and thoughtless pos possible and it show our other focus character Yuu Haruna as the densest pos in anime. the other characters on the other hand are good as Koyuki \u201cTama\u201d Hinashi is emotional and acts based on those emotions which pushes the story and makes everything happen i like her character because she act likehow alot of people would in her situation and is one of the things that makes me like this show despite other issues. we also have Makoto Mikasa our token gay character which clears up and issues Fuuka's character creates because her personality although she can be .... things (trying my best not spoil). the other character aren't that important although they have their places.\\n\r\nthe art on this show is a hit or a miss depending on what your into i like it and i feel it gives the concerts and other occurrences little pushes other art styles wouldn't.\\n\r\nthe music in this show is also amazing and if you don't like the show you will like the music even the ones with engrish.\\n\r\noverall i give the show a 7 i like the art, music, and story the only gripe i have is with the characters but the don't ruin the show for me as they would with most people",

            "content": "From the reviews I have read about this anime, a lot of people dislike the adaptation.  Forced drama, good for a laugh (at the show's expense) but not much else.  But I have to say that I enjoyed this show.  The OP hooked me immediately, and I liked the story (despite some out of character moments and excessive, forced fanservice) enough that I picked up the manga and have read it all.  Over 100 chapters completed in maybe two days.  I liked what I saw there even more, and my greatest fear was that they would cop out on thebig turning point--the place the manga kicked off.  Distinguished itself.  I thought that the worst it would do was throw filler at us, delay the critical moment.\\n\\n\r\nUntil episode 9.  Damn it.\\n\\n\r\nI suspected we might have a problem in episode 8.  No, before that actually.  The moment Akitsuki was approached.  Those who have watched the series will understand my meaning.  But I still hoped that it wouldn't diverge, and this series would become what the manga was--the themes of loss, recovery and music.\\n\\n\r\nWith episode 8, the cop-out began.  When the date didn't go as expected...\\n\\n\r\nIf only it were just a cop-out, I might've been okay with it.  A game-changer at the tail end of a series that probably won't get a continuation leaves a lot of people disappointed.  But they took it a lot farther than that.\\n\\n\r\nEvents diverged from the manga completely, and in episode 9...for me at least, it destroyed the momentum, the promise, the premise I was looking forward to seeing play out on the screen.  I can't say much without spoiling the manga, anime or both--but the way they handled this ruined the emotional impact.  Cheapened the whole story.  The storyboarder and directors were too afraid to stick with what was written, and Fuuka has suffered from it.  Before this episode, I would've given this series an 8 or 9, for the sheer enjoyment it offered.  I still love the music, but I'm no longer sure I will be able to finish watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nI know I sound melodramatic, but I am a writer myself.  I know how it feels to make a drastic move with plot or characters--especially one that pisses off the fanbase.  But of all the ways they could have changed it, they picked the one way that left the story feeling empty, and I'm having a hard time forgiving it.  I suspect my opinion will be unpopular; it often is.  But sometimes, as readers, writers and watchers, we need the push.  The shock value.  Make good on the threat, and change everything.  Sometimes failing to follow through is the worst thing you can do.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could be more specific, but I'm trying to avoid spoilers--and this one is a doozy.  I don't think a cop-out has annoyed me this much in quite a while; I wish they'd stuck with inserting filler episodes, or fleshing out the relationships.  Something that would've left the story's integrity intact.",

This isn't the best anime you will likely ever see, but it's good.\r\nI don't know why I even go on this website everybody is so petty in their reviews. A rating of 1? Really?\r\nWith giving away as little as possible it's about a boy that stumbles upon a girl that knockshim over when running and thinks he's trying to snap a shot of her panties. After this there is only 1 more panty shot so far in the entire anime. That's 2 panty shots in 4 episodes and we get complaints. From what I've seen it may get dramatic from here so we'll see if I'm wrong later on, but the first 3 episodes are the bomb so I would at least watch those and give the show a chance.",

There is a young and energetic girl. She keeps jumping around and claims to make a great band. Okay. That sounds a lot of fun.\r\nHere comes a big turning point when Fuuka gets some compliment on her talent, which is such a good motivation. But guess what? \"A band only needs one person to make it great. The very talented one.\" NO, THANK YOU. Drums, guitars, and keyboards are NOT TRASH. \r\nBasically, this anime messesup the most beautiful meaning of music (that other animes have built up). As a person who appreciates music and all efforts of practicing of musicians, I HATE the story for denying such precious thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI am a quite picky person on art. So 8 is pretty good for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell. They have good opening and songs. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10\\n\\n\r\nNo depth in characters. They act in one consistent way and never change it. Some reactions are just too much, aka over exaggerated. So they became nonsense and annoying\\n\\n\r\nFuuka, who keeps talking about making a band, believes in her talents too much that she ignores basic skills of music, which pisses me off (once again).\\n\\n\r\nAnd people are not born to know how to play music. They have to learn. But all the characters act like they already know how this gonna work if they practice as a band.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI got pissed off by the story and the characters and the story. But the music heals my poor little heart.\\n\\n\r\nOveral 4/10\\n\\n\r\nWell. I can't stand this show any longer. I still love the music though.\\n\r\nI hope anyone who watches this show and wants to pick up an instrument or sing please appreciates the hard work of musicians.",

I've seen awful series before, but have had an awesome soundtrack (Here's looking at you naruto).\r\nSimply put, Fuuka and her friend are not enough to carry a damn show.\r\nSorry for the cussing, butthis series deserve a blunt and scathing review.

It's my first ever review and I'm sad that it's so negative but yeah, it is what it is. I suggest you do NOT watch it, it'll piss you off just like it did to me.\r\nStory: 1\r\nGenuinely pathetic, most cliched of cliches, you can easily predict the whole anime from ep 1, but i was wondering if theyre actually going along with it so i ended up watching all the episodes. Describing the story is justsimply a waste of time so if anyone's reading this, trust me, I'm sparing you a lot of time. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 4 the MAL scores say it all, story was pathetic, and art was just decent. it wasn't half bad but it wasn't really good either, to me it wasn't a problem. Had the art style we see in almost every anime from like 2011-2012.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4 \\n\r\nthe op + ed were fine, you can listen to them, as well as the songs played throughout the anime (theres a music genre just incase). As i said about art, DECENT. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\n1 word for every single character, it's the only word I can use for most of this review: CLICHE. Just by watching the 1st episode, you know the rest of the story right? That means you also know what the characters are gonna do, basically they're also predictable as hell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nWhy 2? Even though I knew what was gonna happen in most episodes, there was one part where we could've gotten rid of a very cringy part of the story, it's where fuuka almost got hit by a truck (idk if this counts as a spoiler)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\r\nFuuka, be grateful, sound and art saved you from the score of ''1'' out of 70k people lol.",
