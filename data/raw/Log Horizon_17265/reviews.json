            "content": "What started off as what seemed to be a bland-version of Sword Art Online turned out to be one of the hidden gems of anime shows. Log Horizon starts off slow with the usual setup of a \"no-faults\" main character, but with a slight difference. That difference is how the main character, Shiroe, strategically approaches each situation that makes Log Horizon an exciting show to watch. Shiroe isn\u2019t the typical shounen main character that powers up throughout the story and then overpowers his enemies. Rather, he\u2019s the guy in the background, the \u201cvillain in glasses\u201d who controls the flow and direction of battle. Overall, LogHorizon is a genuinely fun show without all the pitfalls that we've come to expect from a shounen-type series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins by introducing a set of typical MMORPG rules/restrictions that many viewers are familiar with. But what's not so familiar are the way these rules are manipulated, opening paths to feats that were previously impossible.  When one thinks of rules and boundaries, one would assume that it would limit whatever it governs. Ironically, these strict rules expand Log Horizon's story from a generic show to a well thought-out strategic adventure. It's an extremely appealing story given the relatability to many of its viewers. Having played games like World of Warcraft, I and many other viewers understand how the core mechanics of questing, leveling, raiding and more work. That\u2019s why when other possibilities that greatly affect these game mechanics are discovered, Log Horizon truly becomes special. It also feels completely plausible. It is NOT a \u201cpower of friendship defeating the boss that was previously kicking your ass.\u201d It\u2019s fundamentally sound and really becomes an intriguing show. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough some may disagree, I really thought that one of the show\u2019s biggest strength is how the characters all have defined, unique roles. Where Shiroe is the leader in the shadows, Crusty is the leader in the spotlight. Where Akatsuki is loyal, quiet and small, Naotsugu is the loud, pervy and funny big guy. And you also have... Rundelhaus, who's in a category of his own when it comes to goofiness. These kinds of distinctions allow Log Horizon to have all kinds of interactions between characters and the possibilities become endless. To me, the characters are one of the biggest strengths of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is what makes Log Horizon quite different from a typical shounen show. It has heavy political/economical themes that tie well into one of the show\u2019s biggest points: building a world. In fact, there are a few episodes where the dialogue gets quite heavy and may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea. With that being said, I genuinely enjoyed the dialogue and found the story to be engaging. Log Horizon also executes its' story quite well. I found the pacing and structure of the arcs to be satisfactory and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nArt is decent, it's not UFOtable amazing, but not terrible either. It's consistently pretty decent and not \"inconsistent\" like some other shows. Nothing else to be said here.\\n\\n\r\nSound is decent as well, the opening and ending songs are quite good but take time to get used to. The background music, while not bad, is overused. You'll know what I mean when you get halfway through the season.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, Log Horizon is not a perfect show. For example, why does no one care about what's happening to their bodies in the real world? You'll find yourself asking this question as you watch the show. It's almost as if the topic of what's going on in the real world is completely forgotten. Also, some people may find that the interactions between the characters become quite repetitive, especially with Henrietta, who has a loli fetish for Akatsuki. Her interactions with Akatsuki are always of the same manner and it gets boring very quickly. It seems that Akatsuki's character is reduced to mere loli humor later in the show. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, I really feel that it's important to point out that Log Horizon is not a combat-heavy show. That in itself already distinguishes itself from other shounen shows. But what's really important is how the show focuses on actual strategy and manipulating the rules within the game world that the characters live in. If Log Horizon's story didn't have these elements, I really believe that Log Horizon would not be an exciting show to watch, it would just be another okay show.  \\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon is not your typical show. It has firm grounded roots of realism in a world of fantasy that is genuinely exciting to watch. From diverse characters, to bending the rules in a world most of us are accustomed to, Log Horizon is a good show and is worth your time. With that being said, it is by no means a perfect show. It's a rather simple show in terms of concepts, as well as having plot holes in the overall story. But Log Horizon more than makes up for it in terms of its pure enjoyability (isn't that why we watch anime in the first place?) and execution of its story.",

            "content": "Log Horizon. The basic premise, as is evident in the synopsis, centres around a group of players who by some - as of yet - unexplained phenomenon, got stuck in an online massive multi player role playing game.  \r\nI can imagine anyone familiar with Sword Art Online doing a double take at this point, obviously comparing the two anime, itching to see how one holds up against the other. SAO lovers and haters alike will travel down this line of thought. To be honest, I was and is one of the latter. Infact, I went into the series hoping to find all I missedin SAO after reading some assuring extracts that put this above Sword Art Online. And it did deliver.  \\n\\n\r\nI should mention, however, that this anime is not everyone's cup of tea. If you're not the type to sit down and enjoy a dialogue heavy show such as this, the anime will most certainly come off as dry and boring. To be fair, if you're on the extreme end of dialogue-heavy fanaticism, the end-result won't vary. Log Horizon is the kind of anime that sits on the neutral ground - its dialogue heavy, but the concepts are not overly complex, thought provoking or riddled with worldly wise philosophies. \\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say the show is not intelligent, but nonetheless, if you take the word of Log Horizon fans(a.k.a SAO haters) that judge the show as the intellectual's SAO, then you'll end up sorely let down. Because, at the end of the day, Log Horizon is still a kids show that shows no shame in shying away from the more ugly facets of the scenario, and the devious schemes that characters keep praising as something phenomenal are rather elementary. \\n\\n\r\nNot that its a bad thing, the anime itself doesn't go out of its way to show its characters as human super computers or anything. We just get a normal gamer guy with above average intelligence, and one who actually does his homework to get things done. Seeing he's surrounded by other normal people and AI, it might even be a good thing. The situations themselves doesn't call for anything more than some rudimentary marketing and administrative tactics and strategies. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is in any case, fairly well executed and implemented; you won't find the characters doing utterly pointless actions or going on completely fruitless endeavours. Although, like they say, don't judge a book by its cover, because first arc of Log Horizon can mislead you on the show's main focus. Without spoiling too much, they first go on a rescue mission and the short arc serves as an exposition of sorts to give us a gist of the combat and gameplay mechanics, which while not a central theme, does get some focus later on in the series. Even so, combat is not heavy in Log Horizon. When there is action, it mostly relies on tactics and strategy. There is no one-man show where the mc's love overrides the game mechanics or anything. But, if you forget the two arcs where action is important - Log Horizon is about economics and politics at its core.  \\n\\n\r\nOne significant factor that differentiates Log Horizon from its thematic predecessors like SAO and .hack series is that death  in the game does not equate to death in real life. That is, the players can respawn infinitely. It is not without consequence though, as there is something even more terrible than death that await the players who carelessly let their HP bars easily chip away to zero.  Oops, I said too much. Maybe you should go watch the anime, because I won't be dropping any more spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the sound. The OST at first didn't at all sit well with me. It was sharply contrasting to the shows feel and theme. However, slowly but surely, I ended up loving it and started humming along. I can't honestly speak in-depth about the back-ground score...But they were certainly mood building, though I have my doubts about whether they went overboard with it. Some of the mood-building has gone to water and left me with a facepalm because the epic moments were made epic only because of the soundtracks. Without those, I wouldn't have batted an eye at the game winning strategies the characters employed and would have wrote them off as common sense. Meanwhile, the ending has already found a place in my favorites. Never skipped it, infact, I'm listening to it as I'm typing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was quite mediocre. Nothing to speak of. Its not too bad and its not too good. I felt that it didn't quite feel like a game for most part. But you really can't complain, for all we know, they may not even be stuck in a game per se. The character designs were pretty generic and all of anime's usual motifs are used. I particularly liked the mc's design. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters of Log Horizon are not unique or spectacular in any sense. But they get their job done, and the mc is a wits above fists guy for once, and he's good at it. There is also the charismatic guy who gets all the praise, but luckily, we see him as a side character for the better part of the show. Not really surprising given Log Horizon takes a radically different route than most mainstream shounen shows by focusing on the action behind the scenes far more than the frontline adventures. \\n\\n\r\nI have noticed the characters getting blamed for reacting too calmly towards their predicament and this is one of those criticisms I don't understand. If you came across such a criticism, take my word - that is baseless. Completely baseless.\\n\\n\r\nOne character I was thoroughly disappointed with was the loli assassin, Akatsuki. I actually had high hopes for her. But much to my dismay, her potential as a character was left untapped in terms of both execution and elucidation. I certainly won't condemn her character for development as she seemed to be wallowing in sadness because of her inability to be of sufficient use, and even more her because of her being unable to empathize with the mc towards the end. She still has a lot of potential for development, especially in the light of next season coming shortly. No, my problem is with her lack of chemistry with the mc. The same slap-stick jokes with the show's resident pervert can get old really easily, and the whole cosplay facade she uses to interact with Shiroe doesn't help either. Heck, Shiroe himself thinks her antics are nothing more than cosplaying when her personal monologues shows that she is invested in Shiroe on a more than superficial level. If there was some backstory for such an introverted personality, then I could have let it slip. But sadly, nothing of that sort came up. I'm hoping that the next season will take some time to flesh out her character, seeing she's the main female lead. \\n\\n\r\nRest of the characters were great for the duration of the show and we can hope that they will play more important roles in the upcoming sequel. Some of the secondary cast got a lot more development than the main cast, both a positive and negative point in my books.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother weakness in its character department comes from overuse of certain gags. Shiroe adjusting his glasses when thinking making everyone go 'Ooohh the villain in glasses', Henrietta's obsession with dressing up lolis, Naotsugu's openly showing perverted tendencies only to get interrupted halfway by wrathful Akatsuki etc being only some of the examples. While this is not uncommon or ineffective, too much of these can be frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, this anime is not for everyone. For those who like dialogue heavy anime that is not dark or depressing, with some light slapstick comedy thrown in for good measure - this is exactly what you're looking for.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a last note, I must warn anyone who has been pushed onto taking up this anime by SAO haters - Granted, its different from SAO and does decidedly better than SAO on the story department, particularly the pacing.  But its not the masterpiece that many of them paint it to be. Log Horizon is a little above the average shounen, however, its still an anime with flaws that cannot be overlooked. My own overall score is a result of the kind of entertainment I derived and not at all reflecting of the show's quality from an objective standpoint.",

            "content": "There is a demographic of people who love to dabble in the virtual world of Massively Multiplayer Online games (MMO) to achieve escapism from stress and other struggles that plague their nature. Recently, there has been somewhat of a resurgence of interest for anime fans to watch shows that detail the life of gamers who play these sorts of games, with Sword Art Online being the forefront of it. These shows detail whether the virtual world could become more real to us than what we initially thought of as real from when we were born should be the central theme for these shows to exploreand bring a fresh new take on it. It\u2019s just too bad that none of these shows in question ever bothered to in the first place and become generic as a result.\\n\\n\r\nA year later we have Log Horizon; an MMO inspired anime that has the same scenario as the show above with only a few minor iterations here and there. Now before I begin, this won\u2019t be a piece where I start to compare or contrast both Sword Art Online and Log Horizon, as many people, unfortunately, seem to be inclined to do so. Whether I think Sword Art Online was good or bad should not be a factor on how I feel about Log Horizon in particular. Judging a show by its own merits without any outside influence of another show should be the number one key in critiquing any work. With that said, does Log Horizon hold out on its own?\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to realize about the plot is the tone of the setting and how it feels very lighthearted despite the dire situation that all of the characters are in. As far as the characters know, they have no way of getting out of the game. Many have criticized this aspect as being somewhat unrealistic in how real people would react to something of this magnitude. It might be an understandable critique to offer, at first. However, as the show goes on it feels fitting based on the nature of how the characters think about how they live and survive in the virtual environment. For however long they\u2019ve been trapped in the game for years on end, at least based on their confusing logic, that virtual world becomes their world and get used to it by then. It also helps to the show\u2019s credit that they don\u2019t ever show us the real world at all and keeps it a mystery as to how things are going to make the situation from the characters\u2019 perspective feel more apparent to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this might be one of the stronger points of the show, the story itself in how it is paced and told isn\u2019t nail-bitingly intuitive or well thought out. The premise isn\u2019t that complicated, to begin with, as we\u2019ve been shown before, but Log Horizon seems to think that if they throw in multiple sub-plots into the mix to make it sound complex, it\u2019ll succeed. Unfortunately, those sub-plots I\u2019d mentioned don\u2019t amount to anything special in the long run and aren\u2019t even that memorable because of it. Not only that, but that lack of memorability stems from the fact that all of these political and social constructs that Log Horizon\u2019s world possesses aren\u2019t written clear enough, other than the fact that they\u2019re there to establish some basis for our protagonists to go somewhere. This comes into perspective with how many characters there are to follow in Log Horizon, but I\u2019ll get to that later. The problems with the world-building might be more apparent after knowing that the original creator, Mamare Touno, was responsible for the creation of Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, which also had the same problems in its adaptation that can be compared to this one. These sorts of issues are prevalent in adaptations in this type of scale, but that can\u2019t be an excuse at this point.\\n\\n\r\nThough the massive cast of characters might seem like a huge negative, the way I put it, that shouldn\u2019t mean that all of them are mediocre. The main cast of characters that are prominent throughout the show is exceptionally likable and hilarious to watch due to their numerous escapades with each other. It helps tremendously how they all have their unique characteristics that improve the nature of every one of them, rather than making them all generic and uninteresting. The same thing can\u2019t be said for the side characters, regrettably so. With our main cast being Shiroe, Nyanta-nyan, Akatsuki, and Naotsugu, there\u2019s this decent sense of chemistry between these four characters that is ultimately lacking for our side/supporting cast. All of their archetypes mostly consist of them having a trait that tries to make them distinct, such as Henrietta having an obsession with cute things like Akatsuki, and Serara, who has a habit of wanting to clean things to calm down. At first, it\u2019s humorous, but after a while it becomes redundant, and it doesn\u2019t make them any more meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nIn an action anime centered around the MMO systems, it would make sense to make the anime feel like you\u2019re really in an MMO game from the gritty details of cool-downs, being a tank, healing your party members equally, and conjuring status effects at the right time. I, myself, am one of these people who enjoy these types of games and, to me, Log Horizon is probably the only one that gets it right. Usually something like this would steer off into brainless shounen show cliches, and there are a few here and there. Amazingly, Log Horizon gets the idea of taking its time for the characters to strategize their movements and actions rather than just blindly fighting off monsters without any thought in the world. That might make it seem too slow or methodical to enjoy watching, but in reality, they do a good job in the pacing of these fight scenes and keeping the action flowing seamlessly to give us a clear picture of what\u2019s going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style can be construed as good, just not excellent in quality. The character designs themselves are very plain and ordinary enough for me even to consider them a triumphant success in artistic merit, but we come to expect that, and for what it\u2019s worth, it handles it decently to where they don\u2019t seem to cut any visible corners in the later episodes. As I\u2019ve mentioned about the action being fast and flawlessly executed, the animation is a big part of why those are the case. The fluid character movements feel nice and kinetic to the spells that are cast and look pretty good as a result.\\n\\n\r\nVoice talents range from relatively unknown voice actors to the familiar ones we\u2019ve grown to be fans of giving their artistic liberties to full effect with Log Horizon. Emiri Kato as Akatsuki is devilishly cute and her being a fellow MMO fan sort of gives her performance an exciting spin. Even though Henrietta wasn\u2019t that special as a character, Ayahi Takabaki manages to pull off the mature woman voice well and gives her voice some new territory for her to explore for her vocal talents rather than more boyish female characters. Takuma Terashima proves himself worthy of being the main protagonist of a show, and I hope to see him do more shortly. Not to mention, I could listen to Jouji Nakata say anything with the word \u201cnyaa\u201d at the end of his sentences and never get tired of it.\\n\\n\r\nFor some of us who are fans of the MMO genre, Log Horizon should be the one show to be doing it right, and while it does handle the actual MMO aspects brilliantly, the real narrative and storytelling sets itself down from being great. I do appreciate the amount of depth it tries to convey that wants us to feel attached to the world, yet I can\u2019t help but wonder if that could\u2019ve been done to better effect had it made the narrative more tightly constructive and less cluttered. The saying, \u201cToo many cooks spoil the broth,\u201d sums up Log Horizon perfectly. Only when the eventual sequel comes out, we will know if the journey will be worthwhile enough to experience its next climax.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-\\n",

            "content": "There are certain degrees to which MMROPG series are adapted these days. While not an original concept, Log Horizon has been unanimously compared to another popular series known as Sword Art Online. It\u2019s almost unavoidable considering both series are based off a light novel and relates to character in an MMORPG setting \u2013 an open world based off a video game. But really, that\u2019s all there is to it and the similarities ends there. Log Horizon isn\u2019t a rip off of SAO, .//hack franchise, or anything else relating to the MMOROPG theme. It\u2019s a show that shines in its own way that makes its pointin the horizons.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon is an anime adapted series based off the light novel of the same name written by Mamare Touno. The setting takes place in a virtual world known as \u2018Elder Tale\u2019. Log Horizon follows the story of a young man known as Shiroe who has earned a reputation in the community. His nickname \u201cShiroe the Strategist\u201d fits his title exactly as such because of his analytical skills and abilities of intellect. Together with his companions, they take on this world that blurs between the lines of fiction and reality.\\n\\n\r\nAs a MMORPG series, Log Horizon adapts many of its concepts relating to the fantasy realm. Nothing in Elder Tale is real but they have their own mechanics. These include but is not limited to various classes players can adapt their roles in, monster categories, economic/politic aesthetics, and world concepts. In fact, the world that Log Horizon is based on is colored with all sorts of fantasy attributes; goblins, murlocs, gryphons to just name a few. More importantly is the fact that the world itself also has its own rules such as penalties, death/respawns, pking, etc. On many chances, Log Horizon follows a suit of narrative through which mechanics are explained thoroughly to give viewers insights. These narratives often goes over background information and how exactly certain notions function. Log Horizon presents this flawlessly because it both tell and shows its mechanics firsthand. It brings out its best when the show follows the concepts of actual MMORPG mechanics. As a former MMORPG player, I am pleased to see this such concepts being explored. More so, Log Horizon also focuses on world building with its construction of its fictional universe. It aims to inform, presents it, and delivers.\\n\\n\r\nSeries based off of MMORPG often incorporates a large cast of characters. Log Horizon is no stranger to a large cast. Most prominently however are our main protagonists of the guild \u2013 Log Horizon. Shiroe, Naotsugu, Akatsuki, Nyanta, Minori, Tohya, and Isuzu makes up this group of players and together stands as a unity to face their world. Even from the first episode, there\u2019s a sudden degree of chemistry between each member that can attract viewers to see how it develops. On a technical level, each character has their own personalities and more importantly, a class and level. This is important as each class has a skill of its own as well as a sub-class that is imperative for a guild to survive. For example, Akatsuki\u2019s class is \u2018assassin\u2019 with a sub-class of \u2018tracker\u2019. Both of these functions well in stealth missions where infiltration and gathering information is significant to ensure a guild\u2019s success. Log Horizon demonstrates this well on various degrees by testing the limits of these classes for both its advantages and flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe series functions well in terms of storytelling on most parts. Every episode offers something new to the audience with its game mechanics whether it\u2019s combat, politics, or even culinary. While the series does have its concept of survival, it doesn\u2019t just focus on that exclusively. Rather, its formula consists of various degrees of concepts that connects the story as a whole. It focuses on an internal level of struggle and warfare that sets Log Horizon as a unique series. Furthermore, it also engineers the overall theme of the plot and doesn\u2019t go overboard with its comedy, drama, or even romance. Of course, there is also action offered which brings the show to life with its sequences. What makes it more entertaining and attractive is the way characters engage in combat with their skills based off their classes. Even players in a party such as healers play prominent roles and no one is left in the dust. There is also no player that plays the role of an overpowered protagonist or break through impossible circumstances through deus ex machina. The concepts and mechanics are explained beforehand and applies when the time calls for it. \\n\\n\r\nEven though Log Horizon is the main guild that is explored throughout the series, it doesn\u2019t just focus on them. Supporting characters also get their spotlights with their own classes, levels, and secrets. There\u2019s a degree of connection that the audience can relate to.  There\u2019s no random fan service or the typical cliche of the accidental bath walk-ins that sets no relations. As a fan of MMORPG games, I appreciate its presentation that focuses supporting characters and not just its core players. Even NPCs (non-playable player) gets its exploration that is intuitive. And as a MMORPG based off setting world, it doesn\u2019t forget to add the idea of PKers \u2013 player killers. It\u2019s a common sight to see and offers a threat for players to face beyond just the world and its creatures. \\n\\n\r\nAs fantastic as it sounds, Log Horizon is by no means a perfect series. Fantasy wise, the world of Elder Tale adapts itself well but hard to take it at heart. It quirks into silliness with its high dosage of comedy that makes it hard to take the show seriously on occasions. Demonstrated by its cartoonish designs, most of the characters lacks any features of impressive design. Akatsuki is also advertised as a young girl with a cute face but dangerous nature which is ironic since her age contrasts greatly with her appearance. Her devotion to Shiroe, or rather in her words \u201cprotecting her lord\u201d can get repetitive and lacks substance. Essentially, Akatsuki suffers from developments and characterization. And from some flashbacks are shown, most of the main characters\u2019 backgrounds are only briefly touched and vaguely touched upon. It leaves viewers in the dark as to how our characters became the players are they are in Log Horizon. Finally, the connection between the players in the game and their real life counterparts is completely omitted leaving viewers in the dark on their origins.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some of these drawbacks, Log Horizon still offers impressive features to take notice of. From minute one, the show focuses on its theme and doesn\u2019t venture far off of it. The world of Elder Tale also presents location that is credible such as the natural mountains, the ruined cities (that resembles past civilization), fresh breathing beaches, and dampening caverns. There\u2019s a sense of reality that the audience might relate to if they have played MMORPG games in the past. It adapts itself based on these themes where Log Horizon and should be endeared.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of Log Horizon strikes as a make or break situation. By credibility, it works out very well with adapting its fantasy style of Elder Tale. Satelite studios previously were involved with other fantasy series such as Guin Saga, Arata Kangatari, and Fairy Tail. Here, they make the show believable with its artwork designs at the surface level. On other hand, character designs sometimes becomes distracting and hard to take seriously with their designs. Akatsuki is perhaps the character that stands out the most with her appearance as an assassin but nothing else strikes more than her as that. This same applies to Shiroe with his geeky like appearance that acts as the brainiac of the group. They just seems to be there with its blend background. However, Nyanta is one character to take notice of because of its feline features that really defines the fantasy atmosphere to what Log Horizon is. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise, Log Horizon strikes as an outstanding feature. Beginning with the OP song, the show defines itself with the theme of \u201cDatabase\u201d that blurs between lines of fiction and reality. Most characters\u2019 voices fits their roles well with some that defines their characters more than others such as Nyanta. The OST also performs at a level that matches scenes whether it strikes as important, emotional, cinematic, or comical. The ED song also reflects a more innocent theme with Akatsuki as its main mascot.\\n\\n\r\nAs a former MMORPG player, I appreciate the way Log Horizon presented itself. Rather than just going with a concept of the typical virtual war trope or saving the world, Log Horizon sets its basis on a foundation of mechanics that is presented in an exquisite way. Not only is it accurate to the basis of an MMORPG setting but the characters themselves drives the story with their adequate roles. Log Horizon also likes to focus on various degrees of politics and economics to explore its insight on a more intellectual level. It also adapts world building concepts that becomes a focus to drive the story forward. It explores territory an MMORPG exactly as it should be and doesn\u2019t lose track. On some technical note, it can take some time to get used to the artwork. Comedy can also strike as a hit or miss depending on your preferences. Still, the end game is that Log Horizon is an unique series. It\u2019s not a clone of Sword Art Online or does it leave audience confused. In fact, you\u2019ll likely be forming your own theories as each episode progresses relating to its world and characters. It\u2019s appreciable that Log Horizon can adapts so many concepts into the show as an industrial revolution of success.\\n",

            "content": "Log Horizon is an enormous failure of a show from both an analytical and an MMO-lover\u2019s standpoint. It is so incredibly juvenile, yet unfitting for children due to its jokes on perversion, lolis, and whatnot. Before you stop reading, know at least that I used to love MMOs, and I really wanted to like this show. Alas, Log Horizon is simply too plain, too banal, and too full of itself for any serious anime-viewer to not have their intelligence insulted by it. \r\nLog Horizon is about a group of adventurers trapped inside Elder Tale, a massively multiplayer online role playing game (henceforth simplified as MMO)world. \\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the intentions for using an MMO setting is extremely dubious. The entrapment\u2019s impact on the characters is diminutive \u2013 they seem almost impassive to their predicament. Such unnatural behavior is visibly a deliberate attempt by the author to ignore the existence of and any connections to the real world. The choice of integrating of MMO elements with a fantasy world, rather than setting the story in a traditional one, is naught more than pandering to its audience. The lack of any sexual fanservice is completely made up for by the fact that the entire show is fanservice to people who blindly enjoy seeing gaming elements in their anime, no matter the quality. The MMO-integration is not used as a device to set up or advance the plot \u2013 it is the plot that is blatantly abused for its MMO-fanservice. As a show that lets its gimmicky premise unnaturally dictate the entire narrative rather than using the premise as a means to set up the desired story, Log Horizon was bound to failure from the very beginning. \\n\\n\r\nFor being a fanservice show, Log Horizon seems to not know its audience. It is not correctly aimed at MMO-players as it goes to great lengths to explain the most rudimentary mechanics as if they are great revelations. It might have been somewhat forgivable if such moments were limited in occurrence or length, but they seem to be half the point of the entire series. It would take half an episode to bestow upon its viewers the great insight that is the teamwork between two people which encompassed almost an entire five abilities. Another half episode would then be used to drop the indescribably eye-opening revelation that different members of a team could fill different roles in a team (!!!!). I cannot imagine anyone that has played a MMO for a more than a couple of hours deriving any sort of pleasure from such juvenilities. If on the other hand Log Horizon\u2019s aim is to show people unfamiliar with MMO games the beauty of such games, however unlikely that is, it is nonetheless painting an erroneous and simplified picture of them. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Log Horizon are unbearably bland; each one of them are derived from overused stereotypes, and little effort is spared to develop them beyond their archetypes. There is the scheming bespectacled guy(with a self-insertion quality of kindness), the tiny loli girl, the perverted best friend, the seductive gentleman, the scheming glasses woman(who in a brilliant display of creativity was gifted with a love for abusing lolis) and so on, the characters show no depth or any signs of subtle development throughout the series.  The loli assassin Akatsuki is the epitome of Log Horizons disastrous characterization. She is implied to be the second most important character of the show, yet after 15 episodes she has filled no apparent purpose in the storyline apart from acting out the duties of a loli, i.e. being cute, being abused by loli lovers, and looking up to others. Any other role that she fills are of such insignificance that it becomes apparent the author is just trying to justify her existence in the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnother major problem of Log Horizon is how lacking in self-consciousness it is. Being an exceedingly inane show, the author astoundingly seems to think that it is bursting with intelligence and wit. It goes through significant troubles to build up atmosphere and anticipation for the characters\u2019 cunning plots, which always turn out either completely juvenile or utterly predictable. Each of these moments are accompanied by cornily dramatic voice-acting, clich\u00e9d shifts of tone in art, and overly intense background music, which all contribute to making the already bland show outright ludicrous.\\n\\n\r\nPlease excuse my poor writing which is more rant than review; it is difficult to contain my disappointment in Log Horizon. I was not expecting quality writing or engaging themes; I merely enjoy seeing MMO elements in anime and hoped for an enjoyable show. I could never have imagined the disaster that it turned out to be. While not completely devoid of value, the flaws simply outweigh anything the show does right. Log Horizon may be slightly better in craft than Sword Art Online, but it lacks the trainwrecking fun that SAO had to offer. There is simply no reason to watch Log Horizon.\\n",

            "content": "Log Horizon is the newest \"stuck in a video game world\" anime. Many people claimed before it began that it would be just like the extremely popular and hyped up \"Sword Art Online.\" However, the first episode is enough to dispel any kind of belief that these two shows have anything in common. Take away the video-game-style fantasy setting, and comparing these two shows is like comparing an action/romance anime to a slice of life anime.\r\nLog Horizon follows more of the slice of life route taking a laid-back and slower pace than many other fantasy anime where people are fighting for survival. In the beginning,the players of a video game called \"Elder Tale\" are transported into the game world when a new expansion is released. While surprised and worried at first, they cope with this major problem and decide to adjust to their world rather than try to find the exit immediately. Since people do not actually die when they are killed, there's really not much to worry about. The only main problem is that food and water have no taste, that fighting in the actual world is vastly different from fighting from behind a computer screen, and that some guilds are now taking advantage of new players caught up in the confusion.\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist, Shiroe, is a genius strategist and is at the highest possible level in Elder Tale (as are many elite players). Along with the perverted tank (a person in an RPG who takes hits and protects his allies) Naotsugu and the female assassin Akatsuki, they begin to unravel the mysteries of this world and discover what has changed now in Elder Tale. From saving friends to making hamburgers to protecting entire villages from being pillaged, they are experiencing a whole new world than the one they became so accustomed to playing.\\n\\n\r\nBut, in my opinion, it's just kind of boring. The story's slow pacing drags on parts I wish had not lasted so long, the characters hardly develop at all aside from a group of novice players, and the show ends announcing a season 2 after an anticlimactic finale.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I say any more negatives, I should highlight on one aspect this show does well: the NPCs (non-playable characters). This refers to the people known as \"People of the Land\" in the Elder Tales game. The anime does an excellent job of showing the differences between the \"adventurers\" (people transported into the game world) and the NPCs and how the NPCs are really an entirely different species than the adventurers. This becomes a major plot point in the second half of the series, which was very nice even though that part did drag a little. It's just something I've never seen done before, nor have I ever really considered before (aside from wondering why people in Pokemon and other games never do anything but say one line and stand still their entire lives occasionally giving you random stuff).\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is very large, but hardly anyone gets much screen time. Shiroe is about the only character you can expect to see in even two-thirds of the total episodes doing anything remotely important to the plot. Naotsugu is just kind of there doing nothing, Akatsuki occasionally has some cute moments and does a little spying, and Nyanta's just that guy who ends every sentence the same annoying way. I actually found myself enjoying watching the group of novice players learning to fight together better than I enjoyed watching the main characters and other experienced supporting characters. Aside from Shiroe's planning, the main cast offers hardly anything of interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is noticeably cheap. Some scenes look great while others are just a mess. The character designs are especially poorly animated most of the time as the animators seemed to prefer to save their budget for the scenes that emphasize the beauty of the fantasy game world instead. Even without the poor animation, I did not care much for the character designs. The facial designs were too sharp with shadows sharply defining the boundaries between different parts of the face. Some of the outfits were interesting, like Akatsuki's and Shiroe's, but most seemed very boring considering the wide variety that should be offered in an MMORPG.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one of the better aspects of the show. It may not be done by Yuki Kajiura like in SAO, but it still fits the fantasy world very well and especially fits the moments when Shiroe is scheming. It mostly consists of different string instruments and a few rock tracks during the action scenes (though there's not too many of those).\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy Log Horizon as much as I was expecting. I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I still stand by it. It's just an average show in almost every way (except the way it portrays NPCs) and is fairly forgettable. Not as much happens over the course of 25 episodes as you might think would happen and the characters really needed some better development (and no, forcing a small amount of romance with 3 episodes to go is not development).",

The author's approach on the subject of assimilation, which I personally felt SAO lacked, left me thoroughly satisfied with political and historical based struggles of settlement, such as laws, and cultural integration between Adventurers (Players) andPeople of the Land (NPC's).\\n\\n\r\nBeing a fan and enjoying both series, I will confidently state that I honestly enjoyed Log Horizon more than Sword Art Online as a more unique and thoroughly written and well developed storyline.",

            "content": "Log Horizon is very good anime it approaches the game genre in different. Most people say that log horizon is a virtual reality which it is not. It's a PC game that been going on for longer than a decade. SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT, There is a scene in the anime where it shows the opening screen on a desktop. They also show scene of the actual game through out the series and the game has the graphic of Runescape. Therefore it is not a VRMMORPG like SAO or Accel World.\r\nStory: 10\r\nIncredibly well done. Unlike sword art online they find out that this world isa lot like ours except with magic. NPC's are talk and act like humans and a lot of times they are considered humans. There is no logout button unlike SAO and AW so they have no idea how to leave this world or even if there is a way to leave this worlds. Very original story amazingly done\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI thought art could of done a little better. For example if you pay close attention to certain characters (mainly the main protagonist(Shiro)) you notice facial feature such as jaw lines, unshapely forehead, and the chin line are the most prominent to me they don't look right. Besides the minor facial features it Very amazing art.\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nLH has one of my favorite Sound Track but what really gets me is the battle sounds. For example, one of the scene has a huge battle in an enclose cavern and you hear every rock that fell, every spell that cast and its hit, Slashing of the swords and sounds the characters make through out the battle. Incredibly great audio. One of the best I've seen.\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEvery Character has a perfect character development, especially Shiro. As the Shows move forward you find out Shiro can be very devious and cunning with his actions. He tricks, confuse and even play mind games with people to get his way yet he never lies. Very good development with Characters.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nVery action pack with incredible fight scenes Adventure's through ever changing land and a magical world just waiting to be found. If you enjoy Action, Adventure and fantasy genre's you'll love this one.\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 10",

            "content": "A review for Log Horizon, a show that for a long time has been my favourites, and is currently the only show I've ever fully rewatched. The 2nd season is a different story for me, but this is the first one, and this is the Log Horizon I love.\r\nThis review includes spoilers from only the early episodes, so I can freely explain the plot of the story.\r\nStory: Plot 4/5, Development 5/5, Total 9/10\r\nIn the first episode Shiroe, a gamer that has been playing Elder Tale for soon 8 years finds out he is locked inside his game world. He goes on to find his friendNaotsugu and meets up with an assassin called Akatsuki. In hope of finding out more about this world he now lives in, he goes north on a quest to find Serara, a girl from his friend's Marielle's guild.\\n\\n\r\nThe great thing about the plot is that it is unique, and also not that straight-forward compared to Sword Art Online. What I mean is that you can't see the end of the series in the first episode, and I think that is a great aspect in series. I find motivation to watch the series when I don't know what'll happen and thats why I think the plot of this series is great.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the development - the story goes all different ways. On Shiroe's journey(and in the arcs that don't include Shiroe) you will see all aspects of the Elder Tale community and how it's changed. Shiroe is a man of action, and though there aren't fights all the time Shiroe is always fighting. Some might consider the end of the season weak, but I think it's a great introduction to the second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Animation 2/5, Design 4/5, Total 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Log Horizon is cheap, and the battle scenes are weak(That's probably why we don't see a lot of them). How ever, some fights are still in battle and though the fights dont bring out a lot of visuals they add to the enjoyment in many different ways. The design is very nice and the Elder Tale world is bright and pretty. Later in the show the art suffers, maybe something like a degradation in production work(maybe because of a small budget?) and the things we liked dissapear.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Voices 3/4, OP/ED 0/2, OST 4/4, Total 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voices in the show are mostly on-point, though there were some misfits and I notice the voices are sometimes over-done and sound a bit stupid, though were few of these flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening for this series is a good song, though it's a minus that I can't say \"The Openings\" since there only is one, and you only like it for a while, since in the beginning you think it's too repetetive and in the end of the show you get tired of it. I dislike Loli(a lot) and though I like some J-pop songs this one didn't cut it for me.\\n\\n\r\nFor the OST, this is the best part. It's the main OST, the one where you know Shiroe, our MC is going to f*** s*** up, a happy one, and a couple of neutral ones. Some are done by orchestra's and your ears recieve a great massage in every episode. I absolutely loved the OST for this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/5 Design, 5/5 Development, Total 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters in Log Horizon might seem like clich\u00e8 anime characters to some, but they all have their play in the anime and they all add greatly to a nice community of Log Horizon where all the small chit chats add to the enjoyment. Now for the main characters;\\n\r\nShiroe - Our main protagonist, a university student in his middle twenties, also the strategist of the Legendary \"Debauchery Tea Party\". He is friendly but people call him \"The Villain in Glasses\" because of his drastic choices and amazing plans.\\n\r\nAkatsuki - A loli ninja that includes roleplay in Elder Tale even after the day they all moved into Log Horizon, making Shiroe her master.\\n\r\nNaotsugu - A pervert Guardian that used to be a part of Shiroe's party, being on all the big raids. He also knows Shiroe in real life.\\n\r\nNyanta - Also a roleplayer after the Apocalypse, the half-cat man is referred to as \"Chief\" by Shiroe, Naotsugu and others that used to be a part of the Debauchery Tea Party. Little of his backstory is revealed, though something hints to that he teached Shiroe the game when he was starting out.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the development of the characters, where Log Horizon really outdoes itself. We have development arc's that greatly tell us about the supporting characters and the main characters, we are introduced to traits that we didn't know the characters had and you won't say \"That character is normal, just like me\" just like you would compare yourself to Kirito of SAO, who only does what is ethically correct. The characters develop and move further as they find out more about this world of Elder Tale, especially Shiroe, as a lot of the story is based on his choices.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThough the production is not of the highest quality, I loved this show and I had to rewatch it, since there was so much fuel driving me. All the lovely characters, the story engaging you to go further, episode by episode and the amazing OST of course.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm putting an 8/10 here since I feel this show deserves it, but I have a 9/10 on my list because Log Horizon really has a soft spot for me. Sorry if the review was a bit one-sided.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to put some recommendations at the bottom; If you've only watched shounen and want to try something new, try \"Haikyuu!\", a sports anime about volleyball. If you want to watch another great shounen anime, I'd gladly recommend \"Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakaritsu\", you can read up on the story on another review because it's a bit hard for me to explain.\\n\\n\r\nHope you liked the review!",

            "content": "This anime is one that I went in with mixed expectations. I had heard it was like Sword Art Online, which I found to be 'okay' , I was not a rabid hater nor a blind fanboy... but there parts of it I really liked and others I really disliked. Now when I started Log Horizon I did so with an open mind, not expecting a retread of SAO but also expecting at least some level of similitude and that might be the biggest mistake I made.\r\n(Some very minor spoilers ahead, nothing big I promise)\r\nSTORY:\r\nHere is the big problem with this series. It is pacedatrociously and sets up many subplots that don't seem to add up but that is a minor qualm. The main issue is that although it takes place in a world with dangerous beasts and hostile humans, there is absolutely nothing at stake. It is established very early on that there is no risk of permanent death as characters will just respawn in another part of the world, add to this there is easy access to food and shelter. This effectively de-claws any threat that can possibly occur which I thought was an interesting direction to take the story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, immediately after establishing this, there are several story arcs wherein a character needs to be rescued from danger completely contradict the established lore of the world. There is no danger, there are no stakes, fights are irrelevant. Now I understand that that's the point, but you cannot take away all danger and then tell us a character is in danger. That destroys the premise of the story, especially when said character is running away in terror (You'll know what I'm talking about if you watch the series).\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of SAO, especially early, was the fact that everything was dangerous. There was a very oppressive atmosphere and each action had weight. Here is completely the opposite, nothing matters and because of this,  I found it very difficult to become invested in the story when there is nothing to risk, nothing to gain.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major problem is that the characters are already high level, again this is established very, very early so I am not spoiling anything. One of the major draws to an MMORPG is seeing how a character changes and grows, removing this aspect is neutering a huge draw to the concept. They wrote a completely flat and dull premise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI found the sound serviceable. The performances of the seiyuus were adequate, although I found Akatsuki's voice somewhat annoying but that is purely subjective.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n Character:\\n\r\nAnd here is another major problem. An anime can have a weak or even no story, as long as the characters are strong and have good interaction. In this anime the characters are very generic and bland, the main character is a Wizard equivalent to Kirito, that is to say, a character with unusually high intelligence, designed to appeal to a demographic of individuals that fancy themselves intellectuals. But the character himself is little more than wish fulfillment, which in and of itself is not a bad thing but it is done very poorly. This character is worshiped by those that surround him right from the beginning of the series and this only increases. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy interactions are very forced and the dramatic scenes come off as more comedic. They simply could not find a balance for Shiroe's over 9000 intellect, Akatsuki's strange roleplaying and Nao's bumbling. These characters are unable to carry this anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nEarlier I mentioned I had mixed expectations, that is because I had a bad experience with SAO and hoped for something to wash the taste from my mouth. Watching this anime left me with an entirely different bad taste in my mouth. I honestly wanted to like it at the beginning, but it slowly removed everything I wanted to see in favor of everything I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of MMORPGs, this anime is not for you.\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of action, this anime is not for you.\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of high fantasy and adventure, this anime is not for you.",

            "content": "Hello buddies, why don\u2019t we have a little chit chat over Log Horizon.\r\nLog Horizon is an adaptation of a manga written by the fabulous Touno Mamare. Maybe you already knew him as the creator of Maoyuu Mao Yuusha, which by the way really is something.\r\nThe anime adaptation is directed by Ishihira Shinji who works on Fairy Tail\u2019s adaptation, and some Full Metal \u2019O\u2019 God Alchemist (Brotherhood version of course).\r\nNow that the bases are set, let\u2019s start the review.\r\n   Story: 9\r\nThe main lines are pretty simple. \r\nDue to the arrival of a new expansion pack, a bunch of players are transported into a gamenamed \u201cElder Tale\u201d. In this mess, we are following the daily life of Shiroe and his friends through various situations and challenges.\\n\\n\r\nActually these lines could remind you of SAO (Sword Art Online). Buuuut (you should have expected it :D), the story is way more developed. In fact, where SAO was just barely trying to add some depth to the story, Log Horizon is perfectly managing to create plots in plots through other plots.\\n\r\nEach episode of Log Horizon adds to the plot, which is mainly about the players adjusting to their new world.\\n\\n\r\nThere is something you may keep in mind, this anime is made by Touno Mamare and this is what is really making the difference. If you\u2019ve seen \u201cMaoyuu Mao Yuusha\u201d it\u2019s really really similar. We don\u2019t have pretty much action but it\u2019s still intense.\\n\r\nThis is also reminding me of \u201cSpice & Wolf\u201d (Ookami to Koushinryou) in many ways because it\u2019s not based on pure action but it\u2019s still considered.\\n\\n\\n\r\n   Art/Sound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe work made on the anime is pretty incredible.\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the music here. Opening and ending are both quite good, and the background music is a bit repetitive in the second part of the anime.\\n\r\nThe animations are fluid, but nothing transcendental. \\n\r\nIn a general manner Art is pretty good but could have it improved a bit. They could have made it more like MMY but whatever.\\n\r\nThe thing that made my marked it 8 is the work made on the UI they used in the game. When I\u2019m thinking about augmented reality games I imagine it like that and I don\u2019t feel like they are making fun of my gamer side :)\\n\\n\r\n   Character:  10 \\n\\n\r\nThe character building is pretty impressive too. All the character have a real personality, even if we found the stereotype of all anime (loli, tsundere,..) each character of this anime is important. Even secondary and supporting characters are important. Each of them gives a little plus to the anime.\\n\r\nMoreover Shiroe (the main character) got a really interesting chara design, his personality and action are evolving in an interesting manner.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI feel like I could watch it again and again and I\u2019m eager for the second season which is pretty rare for me.\\n\r\nSome moments are really delightful, other tears you in half.\\n\r\nI really love anime that make me laugh or make me shed tears. And Log Horizon is one of them.\\n\r\nI discovered it by serendipity and after watching I feel like watching \u201cSpice & Wolf\u201d which is one of my favorite anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n   Overall: 9,25\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t feel like marking it 9 because I really enjoyed watching Log Horizon and I\u2019m really eager for the 2nd season.\\n\r\nYou should watch it if:\\n\r\n-You\u2019ve enjoyed watching SAO\\n\r\n-You\u2019ve enjoyed Spice & Wolf and Maoyou Mao Yuusha\\n\r\n-You want a SAO like with a real half season  :DDD\\n\\n\r\nYou shouldn\u2019t watch if:\\n\r\n-You want only action and to put your brain away\\n\r\n-You can\u2019t stand waiting for a 2nd season to come out \\n\r\n-You are an alien\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my 1st review and have a good time watching anime :)\\n",

            "content": "Let's speak about Log Horizon: an anime that tells about, for the most part, the adventures of the characters trapped in a virtual world; definitely very pleasant for those who appreciate the genre, but with some underlying defects that can not be ignored ... But let's start, analyzing, specifically, every aspect.\r\nSTORY 5/10: Unfortunately the story is not the strong point of this anime. In fact, in my opinion, it is a bit abstract and lacking in depth, because this does not seem to have a definite starting point and evolves with a certain repetitiveness and carelessness. It's, essentially, a story based on how the charactersmanage to build a society, to deal with the uncomfortable situation of being trapped in the game;  but, indeed, it doesn't give space to something fundamental, or rather to some normal questions that any sane person, in that situation, would pose: '' How can we get back to the real world? Is there a way to do so or not? ''. \\n\r\nPerhaps because, knowing that they probably will not be able to get back to normalcy, they make their best efforts, almost exclusively to make their lives in the virtual word work; But this thing is not specified in the anime and it may just be a mere reflection of mine, and therefore can not be attributed as a strong point of the story.\\n\\n\r\nART 8/10: As for the drawings in general, they are very well made and cared for. The environments are very colorful and bright, almost enticing the viewer to dive in; the graphics of the characters are really well done and linear, and even the animations are well cured and sliding.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 7/10: Very interesting regarding the sound level: the openings and endings are beautiful; pleasant are also the various OSTs present in the anime, and finally they also made a not bad dubbing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7/10: In this anime there is a wide range of characters who are more or less useful, but with the almost total lacking of villains, that kind of annoyed me. Let's start from the main protagonist Shiroe, also known by several nicknames because of his personality, he is definitely the cornerstone of the anime, in fact, thanks to his skills as careful strategist, he will manage to put aside the rivalry between the various guilds and create a good basic society. To help him in this endeavor there will be Akatsuki, a ninja that will strongly  bind to him, and Naotsugu, his longtime friend. Then there will also be many other secondary characters, such as Nyanta, a catman who will have some merits in the culinary field, Marielle, head of one of the guilds, Henrietta, her second (my favorite), and many others that will contribute to make the watching of the anime sliding and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 7/10: I didn't mind this anime, because there have been many moments of hilarity and madness, which made me laugh a lot; for example the way how Shiroe used to get annoyed because of his nicknames, or when Akatsuki was teased by Henrietta etc etc ...\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, it is a partially successful anime, apart for the story which is vacuous and baseless. I strongly hope that these flaws will be resolved in the second season, because I think that this anime has a lot of potential and it would be a shame to make it vain because of a dull story.\\n\r\nIf I were to recommend someone to see whether or not this anime, I would say so, because it is very fun and enjoyable, and it is perhaps this what  makes me close one eye on the defect of the story.\\n",

            "content": "**The character development part of the review is not good.**\r\nYet another MMORPG anime. \r\nPeople always compare LH with Sword Art Online. For me, I cannot find even the slightest similarity between them. They are two completely different show with distinct objectives and focus. I have not started season two as for the time this review was written thus tis purely based on my impression on the first season. All constructive criticisms are welcomed via PM or comment. They will be greatly appreciated. \r\nSTORY (Concept 3.5/5, Development 4/5) Rounded down\r\nThe series starts off with a terribly explained situation: random players get trapped in a fantasy universe.great. massive cliche. In the world of Elder tale, they have absolutely no objective whatsoever and finding a reason to live is extremely challenging. The protagonists along with his companion begin their journey to, uh, no where. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of trying their butt off to get back to the reality, they seem to be okay with their dire situation. This lead to a problem since we tend to forget it is a \"game\", rather than a normal fantasy universe. Yes, things such as game mechanics and the \"death's penalty\" introduced later in the series do remind us of what is going on, but on a grand scheme of things, it becomes rather confusing and pointless. \\n\\n\r\nRather than action-packed fights and emotional rollercoaster, LH decides to take a intellectual route. The establishment of government and the negotiations with other factions are some interesting plot lines that involves multiple characters and they give people reasons to continue watching this show. Although some of the lines are kind of bad paced (princess arc) and misleading (round table), the curiosity (if you have any) will probably make you wonder what will happen to these characters. Some of the stories are somewhat smart, but none of them really clearly communicate the moral message to the audience which makes the entire series feels like a popcorn show. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the show... it feels like a harem anime but I guess I'll let it slide since the majority of the story is considerable interesting. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (Design 5/5, Development 4/5)\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon does not really follow the general formula of adventure-type stories. The typical Adventure consists of a idiotic protagonist and bunch of followers to help him out. In LH however, the characters play their unique role without a sense of \"everybody helps one dude\" feeling. The character designs not complete copycat, but they look pretty familiar. \\n\\n\r\nNotable Characters include Shiroe the mastermind, Akatsuki the bodyguard/lover, Naotsugu the tank and Nyanta is awesome cat. \\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of Lelouch and Light Yagami, I can see the shadows of his predecessors in Shiroe's personality. He is clever, but not to the point where the world trembles beneath him. There isn't really too much of development as I can recall (there is, but they are definitely not notable enough to be noticed or cared), but throughout the series we learn about him gradually. I feel like his mind isn't all that clear in the beginning and at the end I do learn more about him as a complete person. Perhaps that counts as development? \\n\\n\r\nIronic enough I don't feel like any other \"main characters\" have developed at all. Akatsuki changed her opinion toward Shiroe slightly, Naotsugu stays as an dumb tank and Nyanta keeps his image as the big daddy despite how awesome a daddy he is. \\n\\n\r\nThe three little kids have their cliche development and that's pretty much it. reminds me of third Hokage's son's team in Naruto. \\n\r\nThe romance between the princess and Krusty was a very interesting touch. I almost felt like he is the hidden protagonist of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the design is quite unique and interesting and the development are scattered all over the place. I personally like that. All of the characters get a little bit of love. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGRAPHIC (Art 5/5, Animation 2.5/5) Rounded up\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the show is considerably unique. Not all characters have the same face (shout out to SAO) and they are quite comfortable to look at. The armors and clothes have different designs on different persons, each guild has its signature color and style. The background is very beautiful. The art focuses on landscape and the 16th century architecture. Each city has its unique building style and the background. You may not like it, but the effort is there for sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan service in the show is very minimal. (Hurray!) \\n\\n\r\nAh... The animation. The animation is shit. It is just so bad. It was made in 2013, and there shouldn't be any excuse to use simple flashy light to represent most if not all super abilities. The skill control menu panels are quite cool but when you compare them with SAO's... uh... not the most exciting animation and action. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (OP/ED 1.5/3, OST 3/3, Voice 2/4) Rounded down\\n\\n\r\nDATABASE DATABASE DATABASE. This is one of the openings that I will absolutely skip no matter what happens. I wouldn't even consider listening to it just for the sake of appreciation. No, the opening is a very poorly written song that has no connection to the theme of the anime. I can only think of a person who loves repetitive noise booster who would enjoy the song. The ending is very cute. And that's pretty much it. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST however is top tier. The majority of the songs are made of various instruments you can find in a traditional orchestra blended with some electronic addons. The heavy metal feelings and the occasional vocals makes great combo. They give a nice sense of glory. I would say the OST is what carries this production without letting it completely overshadowed on the back of SAO. (Yes, the LH OST is better than SAO's in MY opinion. it is just more engaging and stylish.) \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is plainly average. Every character sound too unemotional and the lack of personal identification fails to give the show a fair atmosphere. That said they are not hard to listen to, it's just not good enough. The Japanese original is actually much better. I personally would recommend sub over dub, but if you hate reading, the dub won't do too much harm on your overall experience. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite the problems I pointed out previously, I find some of the elements especially enjoyable. The big cast of character and the unique way of narrative (we don't know what people are actually thinking) along with the glorious OST is beyond my expectation. The story isn't that good, but it is still considered semi-intellectual which I enjoy, very. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7.5/10) Rounded up \\n\\n\r\nAnimation aside, Log Horizon is a very well made SHOUNEN anime. Tho not brilliant in any particular aspect, the plot is very intriguing. Instead of randomly coming up with ideas one after another, the story built upon each other. With that in mind, I kindly overrate this a little bit since I believe it simply isn't fair for the creators since too many shounen shows are full of fillers and misleading plot/characters. This is definitely one of the shows that is worth checking out and I would say it deserves much more attention/credit than what it is got. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't find this review helpful, please give me some feed back so I can improve my content and give higher quality contribution to the community, thank you! :D\\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "Thunder's Review no.2: Log Horizon\r\nLog Horizon, another anime about gamers trapped in a virtual world. Concept that isn't new to the anime world, long before Sword Art Online there were few anime that tried to satisfy both gaming geeks and anime fans. Does Log Horizon succeed with that? Well, as both a gamer and anime fan I must say that I have mixed opinion about that.\r\nThe Story 6/10\r\nThe beginning is in fact quite interesting. Our main protagonist realize that he can't log out, find some friends and then the story proceed with exactly what it should be doing. It explains how the game(called Elder Tale)is functioning. It helps us getting interested in not only what happens to the characters but even in game world itself. There are even some interesting fights with both players and monsters at the beginning which show us another great merit to the story. Almost every fight throughout the whole show is won with tactics(until some point). Tactics that any MMORPG gamer will be familiar with. Characters are using many MMO terms witch is also a nice touch for the gaming aspect of the series. Besides combat Log Horizon do a great job on explaining basics of a classical MMO game: economy, crafting, NPCs, leveling, dungeons/raids, guilds and etc... It's quite interesting to look at how real people try to take advantage or bypass the rules and how they are trying to get by in this familiar, yet new world.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see I think that Log Horizon handle gaming aspect very well but there are some downsides that simply cannot be ignored. As I wrote, beginning is quite good but it's hard to take the show seriously from the start because no one can die. People are just respawning after death. Eventually it stopped being a problem but it heavily influenced my first impressions, in a negative way. I just couldn't care for the characters that are immortal.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon surely is an anime that concentrate more on talking than anything else. Talking, comedy and rarely combat, especially in the latest part of the show. Shiroe is a real badass and can come up with really awesome master plans but it takes forever for something to happen. After the beginning tempo and lively energy that anime had is lost, pacing is very slow and there are some parts that are straightly BORING. It doesn't help that comedy in a show is on a very low and child-like level. Maybe it's just isn't my sort of humour but I did not find most of the jokes funny at all. Eventually when something happens show gets very good but it just does not feel worth the time spend waiting.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part when I would be trashing the ending but just after the last episode was over there was a communique that we are getting another season very soon, in fall this year. Keeping that in mind I won't judge the ending and save it for another season. I have good feeling about the second season, oh this wind of adventure! UPDATE: Second season was a disappointment :( \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Animations 6/10\\n\r\nLog Horizon have somewhat usual art style. Characters clothes and armor are rather generic fantasy stuff but there are few characters that look better than others with some really awesome gears. My favorite part about the art are backgrounds, sometimes they are really beautiful, they give the feel that it really is a game and a very good looking one. Animations themselves are nothing special but they are solid at least. Unfortunately Log Horizon suffers from the big amount of obvious budget cuts, there are too many still images. Nonetheless overall animation isn't bad and cool backgrounds make it score above average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound 7/10\\n\r\nOverall soundtrack is good and there are few tracks that are better than others, included the main theme which is probably my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nOver dramatic opening was awesome featuring very good song \"Database\" by Man with a Mission. Opening suited the show perfectly and I would definitely put it somewhere on my top anime openings list. Ending song was good (really, girls with umbrellas dominated that season endings) and so was voice acting featuring many talented people.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters 7/10\\n\r\nLog Horizon have a huge and diverse cast of characters. Despite huge amount of characters, they all feel somewhat needed and even some lesser supporting characters are given decent character development. Of course show focuses on some characters more than the others and we get to know chosen few quite well when the rest are there just to interact with them. Almost all characters are easily likeable, not included villains. Also our main protagonist is a real bad ass, and by bad ass I mean that he is a very smart individual that everybody can rely on. Not some cowardly looser that just happened to be a hero. Shiroe is a hero that world of Elder Tale needs, but not the one that it deserve. He is a real Dark Knight \"Villain With Glasses\" just as he's called. The rest of the main and supporting cast is okay, but there are no other on Shiroe's level of coolness. There are also some forced romances, actually few of them but as usually with shows with PG13 they are going nowhere. And as I wrote before I did not liked most of the humor that this shows characters represent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nFrom the beginning Log Horizon really caught my interest few episodes in and I enjoyed gaming part of it but later it was just getting worse and worse as everything took forever to happen. I really enjoyed some moments of the show, sometimes bigger parts but in the end bad comedy and simple boredom almost made me drop it. Gladly I did not drop it and will be waiting for second season but as of now it is kind of mixed experience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nMy feelings about the show are mixed, but I have hope(and I was let down). Log Horizon still have potential to be much better, I certainly will be watching the next season this fall. Hopefully Shiroe will have something really good up in his sleeve.(he hadn't, don't bother with second season)",

            "content": "While Log Horizon may not end up being in the list of favorite shows all too many times, and while majority of its characters won't have a long-lasting impact on the audience, it still manages to be a fun ride with occasional fantastic moments as well as some downfalls which all eventually balance themselves out.\r\nWhen I first found out about the show, I, as many probably have, instantly thought \"Oh look, carbon copy of SAO. *sigh*\". Still, as I scrolled through some opinions, a lot of people have said that Log Horizon plays out as SAO should have. I'll leave that to your own decisionsand instead will focus on Log Horizon as an separate entity in the anime world. \\n\\n\r\nLH follows Shioru, our main protagonist who suddenly finds himself locked in a world of \"Elder Tale\", massively popular MMORPG with over twenty million people worldwide. He soon forms a party of three, with Akatskui, honorable shinobi who shall always follow her lord and knee the pervert, Naotsugu. Fortunately, that is not where the cast ends and we are soon introduced to heavy array of characters, ranging from veterans to beginners, each given enough time so we can learn something about them. Unfortunately, not all of them are that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of LH works as a cohesive unit, but what really struck me was the world building. It really did feel as if the author invested a lot of time into making a specific world which does resemble that of MMORPGs - oftentimes, before the OP, we're given some information about the world and its rules which serves its purpose of introducing us, or rather helping us dig further in as to what kind of a world Elder Tale forms. Without spoiling too much, the story of LH is somewhat divided into short arcs, each one way or the other connected to the overall plot which comes into focus later on. Each separate entity is enough fun for itself and the mysteries introduced, especially the characters, are enough to keep your attention on. Overall, story was well above decent, albeit nothing too masterful. It did its job and it did it well.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to production department, I'd call it the weakest part of the anime. Visuals are often stiff, animation often lacks impact and even battles, albeit exciting, aren't as good as in other similar shows. Even though character designs vary, it does feel as if too many characters are similar and/or act in similar fashion which is oftentimes just a sore. Another gripe I have with the show is the sound and all its merits. Some VA did a fine job representing their characters while I wouldn't be so certain when it comes to rest. There are, sometimes, weird pauses during their speeches which don't fit their character. The soundtrack itself was sorely lacking though; there is maybe 1 or 2 memorable themes while others are barely noticeable at best. I do feel that the soundtrack and the sound overall could have been given more time, especially because of the settings. Some spells, for instance, Astral Howl, do have that visual and sound impact while others ... well, don't. They're too generic. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of LH are ... well, some are decent, some are rather good and some are just plain unnecessary. Shirou, our main character, is a good spin on the \"all powerful MC\". Although anime, or rather characters within anime world, try to sell him as this almighty entity, we soon realize that he's just an above-average intelligent student with enough capacity to work with the information he gets. It's a nice spin and I did like his character overall. The other duo, faithful shinobi and open pervert did their job as a good support and humorous pair. Sometimes they'll get at your nerves, but more so than not they're quite likable. When it comes to the rest of the cast, I'll be honest: it's not that great. Especially the children, or the beginners as they call them. They're oftentimes annoying and given too much space and time which they simply seem to misuse to irritate the viewer even more. While there are some interesting characters, you'll simply feel as if the anime would have been better either without them or with them having less screen time. \\n\r\nOther characters do have somewhat defined personalities, and are sometimes joy to watch (Crusty and princess come to mind), but even then they don't feel developed enough. Overall, though, given the number of characters with names, faces and personalities, I think they did a fine job representing them. \\n\\n\r\nI would lie if I said I didn't enjoy Log Horizon. Was it mind-blowing? No, not really. Was it this epic adventure you'll remember forever? Erm ... no. But it was a fun ride that lasted 25 episodes and I am looking forward to the sequel (mostly because I'm interested about one girl from Shirou's flashbacks. She seems fun). Battles were smart and weren't \"oh, I'm this massive dude and my powaaah is bigger than yours\" but instead they focused on teamwork of parties, which I found quite intriguing. The touch on politics and economics might put some viewers off but I personally enjoyed them and saw them as another layer of depth to an already established world. So yeah. Me like me some LH. (sorry Star Wars fans :() \\n\\n\r\nIf you do feel like SAO was lacking something or if you're simply looking for a decent anime, you can't go awry with Log Horizon. It isn't epic, it isn't mind blowing, it won't send you to places that will make you think about your life, but it will provide temporary enjoyment and it won't bore you to death. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: recommended.",

            "content": "At the peak of my disgust of all of RPG Anime things, here comes the Log horizon. Unfortunately not saving the day just making it a bit better but that suffices for now. Let me clear up some things first before I will get to the review itself.\r\nUsually RPG Anime genre which is at some point certainly very tempting but nonetheless vastly empty, except the fact that the story is happening in virtual environment nothing new nor awesome is going on by all means. Not mentioning all of the wasting of potential for fun-service which is understandable for the simple reason that most of Animeconsumers are MOE zombies and primal reason of existence of companies is revenue. At the end of the day we don't very often get a quality product.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started watching LH I almost quit, guess why? I had enough of \"This is not SAO\" shows. A week later when I cooled down a bit I gave it a second chance. Now I am really happy that I did so.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to evade comparison between SAO and LH. Actually I do not understand why everyone feels the need to compare these two Animes. The only common element here is that real people get stuck in an MMORPG, the result is different. Unfortunately two of them have been confronted so often, that I don't have a choice.\\n\\n\r\nThe show started quite slowly with what seemed like typical, hackneyed plot. But later things start to snowball. Problems are getting more serious and world begins to take on dimensions, both growing at a steady pace. The animation is very pleasing for the eye and the music aspect also has a lot of nice \"straight out of game\" like soundtracks. Action scenes seem to be rather lacking in this kind of genre however the in-show implemented game mechanics explanation is acting like compensation. The imbalance between dialogues {not as important ones} and the action is a con. LH is unfortunately Shounen so we can't evade Clich\u00e9 and fun service.\\n\r\nConstant rubbing of glasses by our smart-ass heroes was pissing me off. The main character, Shiroe, plays both the protagonist and antagonist role. He is behind everything, playing the game, always having some card in his sleeve {NGNL similarity}. Akatsuki aka. Lolininja is a wasted potential. Then we got a pervy guy Naotsugu and antipole gentleman catman Nyanta {WTF}. Even though this Anime certainly has some problems like slow acceleration from the start and cheesy humor the plot is really good and most importantly the RPG element is very well executed.\\n\\n\r\nThe authors of this elaborate work we're aware of the potential and did not make the same mistake as the SAO, which was mostly about {weakly executed} romance and nothing else. LH truly focuses on the breathing online world where the players are imprisoned, the impact of their actions and choices on the world, communication with the NPC, skills and abilities, magic system, events etc. Unlike in SAO. There is no sense of imminent threat. So whatever is happening its still just a game {little memory loss is nothing compared to death imo}\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show for all the SAO haters out there. Anyway, I am looking forward to the second series.",

            "content": "People trapped in a MMORPG sounds like something we've seen at times especially recently, we have one of the animes that more polarized as the community:Sword Art Online\r\nSAO is a similar premise, but still quite different in their implementation and development and it is not fair to compare one nor to the other.\r\nWhat makes it different, Log Horizon show some implication from the first chapter, which will be the tonic that makes the whole anime, and its they're stuck in the game, what they gonna do now?\r\nThat's what makes it different, the lack of an objective/specific goal that leads them to be more outstanding fightto survive, from this point that the narrative focuses on present problems of a society, such as abuse of power, disregard, power forces, commerce, social classes and even in some part the migration.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon complex issues is a pretty nice way, and that is the true subject of the picture, not a villain at first glance, human relations become a sort of villain with which our protagonists struggle, plus some moments that are involved in battles that represent fairly realistic as are the MMORPG\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well-drawn, all very good complete its mission within the anime including the one that most stands out is Shiroe strategist, which is one of the best protagonist in a while, in the course of the anime have seen a progress in the character to first costs interact with others to take the risk of being the head of a movement, he understands he has to put aside the passivity, and if you want to improve you have to take initiative, his nickname \"the villain with glasses\" is that as a strategist knows that there are sometimes you have to push a little more rules on the strings to achieve its mission, which goes beyond normal prototype of the perfect protagonists, which works and gives a perfect theme for anime touch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty well done and consistent, good fluidity and the few fight scenes are technically very good, the character design is pretty good too, in part sound also very acceptable nothing extraordinary but pairs well running scenes, what would be the opening database remarkable feat. Takuma ( 10 Feet ) executed by Man With a Mission.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon is a highly recommended for those who enjoy complex topics anime, the anime has a few action scenes or fights, contains elements of comedy that much lighten the atmosphere , in many chapters the protagonists are caught up in conversations so if 're not the type to enjoy that nearly 80 % of the chapter no action is not an anime for you, but you invite him to give it a try , it's really a good option to see and in October it has been revealed will have a second season.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Log Horizon follows in the same path as Sword Art Online in being focused on a popular MMORPG game where thousands of its players find themselves incapable of logging off the game under mysterious circumstances. Unlike SAO though, Log Horizon is a bit more light-hearted in its focus on how players handle their rather unique situation and the serious moments are not as heavy-handed, the latter being the major reason why I never got drawn into Sword Art Online. Mainly focused on enchanter Shiroe and the members of his party, our leads strive to restore stability and order to the game as many players areabuse their unique predicament for personal gain to enforce their will on weaker players, steal items and player-killing.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does a rather great job tackling the normal behavior of players participating in an MMORPG with novices, veterans and rule-breakers. This can involve anything from helping novice players, making friends, actively participating in game activity or actively abusing the unique circumstances of the game. Regular MMORPG activity such as special events, forming guilds, gaining game experience and getting rare items is seen and part of regular social activity within the series. Those that form parties even strategize to develop strategies to fend off enemy threats as they either compete against rogue parties or fend against enemy monsters. In addition, logging out of the game isn't the only bizarre thing affecting players and the gaming environment as other bizarre things pop up that get explored which affect how players deal with their present situation.\\n\\n\r\nGaming isn't the only element addressed within the series either as a good chunk of the anime's plot revolves around Shiroe and his comrades trying to make sense of their current situation in the game and restore order to it. The task isn't an easy one as players are wary of the current gaming environment thanks to guilds and parties reigning control over parts of the game and intimidating other players into joining their ranks or not to put up any resistance. Through extensive knowledge of the game and social interactions between others, Shiroe develops a number of plans throughout the series to deal with rogue guilds, rescuing novice players, dealing with hostilities and bringing some semblance of rules for players to follow that involve some bits of ruthlessness as he exploits unique abilities and game resources to drive off the corrupt elements affecting players within the game.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond Shiroe, we do get introduced to a number of other characters who have their personalities and mentalities explored as to why they participate in the game. While a number of them milk character types typical of MMORPG and rom-com titles, they are still a likeable bunch and the majority of characters get enough fleshing out where you can connect with them as they adjust to events that take place throughout the series. Only issues that come up with the series for me are hit-and-miss attempts at comedy coming from typical anime tropes mostly coming from Akatsuki's character in some form, a few rather shallow characters and the series still ongoing into its second season as the mystery surrounding the changes to the game still left unresolved.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Log Horizon was an engaging series for the most part as it struck a nice balance between typical MMORPG activity and its plot exploration with Shiroe trying to deal with their unique situation taking place in the gaming world and restoring order to it when chaos breaks out. Fans of MMORPG-based anime titles should give the series a look.",

I especially did not enjoy Akatsuki the assassin-girl. It seems like she could have had a whole lot more depth to her but they didn't add it in. Shiroe is definitely one of the best male protagonists I've recently seen (much more interesting than Kazuto from SAO), and by the end Minori seems to almost takeover the female lead role from Akatsuki.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: Living in the Database, Database, whoa-o. That intro song is hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nOverall, I think that I will definitely be watching the 2nd season once it's completed. Is it \"better\" than SAO? I think it does a better job of fleshing out the game world they are stuck in than SAO, but does a poor job of explaining the real world situation outside the game, which is where SAO excels. I see no reason for someone not to watch both SAO and this to see which one they prefer, as they both have something to offer.\\n",

            "content": "Log Horizon is an adventure anime where our cast is among the people who have been trapped in an online game representation of Japan.\r\nThe story is somewhat multi-faceted. It starts with the characters simply trying to figure out the working of their new world into trying to manage it. There are other small arcs that interconnect these things together. At the start of the anime I was very impressed with how it really seemed like they were in a fully functional MMO with rules and teamwork. Almost everything in the anime somehow focuses on different aspects of what you would know from an MMO andhave interesting takes on how the changes would affect them.\\n\\n\r\nI was also impressed with how well they built the world. It has all the elements of an MMO and yet they don't neglect the fact that changes are being made within the world and take into account how these changes might affect the rules and characters within the game. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is reasonably large but it's really only fair to focus on a few characters, the main Shiro, is a decent male lead who essentially is the gateway for things to happen in the anime. While a lot of the cast is likeable an issue is that a lot of the main characters get almost no development, and this includes Shiro.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say there is no character developmet, it's there... but the side characters get it. Now, again, just about all of their growth is facilitated by Shiro, but I do find it odd that the main cast simply follows their archetype like Shiro is devious and Akatsuki is one of those shy type girls fully devoted to Shiro. While the side characters start to change their stripes and question more than their situation, they question themselves and their character.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a problem with Log Horizon beyond the weird development imbalance. Honestly, that's not even a huge issue. It's that it seems to dress up what should be a trivial problems and make them much larger than they actually are. The pacing of the show is also somewhat odd since they will often place little fun episodes in for no reason at all, not even fan-service, it's like they are just there. It's not even a filler episode since a lot of them somehow link to the next one, it just has a very different tone.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that there is a very distinct lack of action as the show begins to take the turn more into the affects of the change in the world versus the world being an MMO itself. Because of this there is a lot of dialogue without much payoff for conversations since everything is building to something else, and a lot of these are not yet realized.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is somewhat middling. Not bad mind you, but just not impressive. The OP is great and while the music does take some time to have its full affect in the show, it steps things up along the way. The sound in the anime is impressive.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon has some amazing world building and an enjoyable cast of characters but fails to capitalize on them beyond a surface level.",

            "content": "What started off as what seemed to be a bland-version of Sword Art Online turned out to be one of the hidden gems of anime shows. Log Horizon starts off slow with the usual setup of a \"no-faults\" main character, but with a slight difference. That difference is how the main character, Shiroe, strategically approaches each situation that makes Log Horizon an exciting show to watch. Shiroe isn\u2019t the typical shounen main character that powers up throughout the story and then overpowers his enemies. Rather, he\u2019s the guy in the background, the \u201cvillain in glasses\u201d who controls the flow and direction of battle. Overall, LogHorizon is a genuinely fun show without all the pitfalls that we've come to expect from a shounen-type series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins by introducing a set of typical MMORPG rules/restrictions that many viewers are familiar with. But what's not so familiar are the way these rules are manipulated, opening paths to feats that were previously impossible.  When one thinks of rules and boundaries, one would assume that it would limit whatever it governs. Ironically, these strict rules expand Log Horizon's story from a generic show to a well thought-out strategic adventure. It's an extremely appealing story given the relatability to many of its viewers. Having played games like World of Warcraft, I and many other viewers understand how the core mechanics of questing, leveling, raiding and more work. That\u2019s why when other possibilities that greatly affect these game mechanics are discovered, Log Horizon truly becomes special. It also feels completely plausible. It is NOT a \u201cpower of friendship defeating the boss that was previously kicking your ass.\u201d It\u2019s fundamentally sound and really becomes an intriguing show. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough some may disagree, I really thought that one of the show\u2019s biggest strength is how the characters all have defined, unique roles. Where Shiroe is the leader in the shadows, Crusty is the leader in the spotlight. Where Akatsuki is loyal, quiet and small, Naotsugu is the loud, pervy and funny big guy. And you also have... Rundelhaus, who's in a category of his own when it comes to goofiness. These kinds of distinctions allow Log Horizon to have all kinds of interactions between characters and the possibilities become endless. To me, the characters are one of the biggest strengths of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is what makes Log Horizon quite different from a typical shounen show. It has heavy political/economical themes that tie well into one of the show\u2019s biggest points: building a world. In fact, there are a few episodes where the dialogue gets quite heavy and may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea. With that being said, I genuinely enjoyed the dialogue and found the story to be engaging. Log Horizon also executes its' story quite well. I found the pacing and structure of the arcs to be satisfactory and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nArt is decent, it's not UFOtable amazing, but not terrible either. It's consistently pretty decent and not \"inconsistent\" like some other shows. Nothing else to be said here.\\n\\n\r\nSound is decent as well, the opening and ending songs are quite good but take time to get used to. The background music, while not bad, is overused. You'll know what I mean when you get halfway through the season.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, Log Horizon is not a perfect show. For example, why does no one care about what's happening to their bodies in the real world? You'll find yourself asking this question as you watch the show. It's almost as if the topic of what's going on in the real world is completely forgotten. Also, some people may find that the interactions between the characters become quite repetitive, especially with Henrietta, who has a loli fetish for Akatsuki. Her interactions with Akatsuki are always of the same manner and it gets boring very quickly. It seems that Akatsuki's character is reduced to mere loli humor later in the show. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, I really feel that it's important to point out that Log Horizon is not a combat-heavy show. That in itself already distinguishes itself from other shounen shows. But what's really important is how the show focuses on actual strategy and manipulating the rules within the game world that the characters live in. If Log Horizon's story didn't have these elements, I really believe that Log Horizon would not be an exciting show to watch, it would just be another okay show.  \\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon is not your typical show. It has firm grounded roots of realism in a world of fantasy that is genuinely exciting to watch. From diverse characters, to bending the rules in a world most of us are accustomed to, Log Horizon is a good show and is worth your time. With that being said, it is by no means a perfect show. It's a rather simple show in terms of concepts, as well as having plot holes in the overall story. But Log Horizon more than makes up for it in terms of its pure enjoyability (isn't that why we watch anime in the first place?) and execution of its story.",

            "content": "Log Horizon. The basic premise, as is evident in the synopsis, centres around a group of players who by some - as of yet - unexplained phenomenon, got stuck in an online massive multi player role playing game.  \r\nI can imagine anyone familiar with Sword Art Online doing a double take at this point, obviously comparing the two anime, itching to see how one holds up against the other. SAO lovers and haters alike will travel down this line of thought. To be honest, I was and is one of the latter. Infact, I went into the series hoping to find all I missedin SAO after reading some assuring extracts that put this above Sword Art Online. And it did deliver.  \\n\\n\r\nI should mention, however, that this anime is not everyone's cup of tea. If you're not the type to sit down and enjoy a dialogue heavy show such as this, the anime will most certainly come off as dry and boring. To be fair, if you're on the extreme end of dialogue-heavy fanaticism, the end-result won't vary. Log Horizon is the kind of anime that sits on the neutral ground - its dialogue heavy, but the concepts are not overly complex, thought provoking or riddled with worldly wise philosophies. \\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say the show is not intelligent, but nonetheless, if you take the word of Log Horizon fans(a.k.a SAO haters) that judge the show as the intellectual's SAO, then you'll end up sorely let down. Because, at the end of the day, Log Horizon is still a kids show that shows no shame in shying away from the more ugly facets of the scenario, and the devious schemes that characters keep praising as something phenomenal are rather elementary. \\n\\n\r\nNot that its a bad thing, the anime itself doesn't go out of its way to show its characters as human super computers or anything. We just get a normal gamer guy with above average intelligence, and one who actually does his homework to get things done. Seeing he's surrounded by other normal people and AI, it might even be a good thing. The situations themselves doesn't call for anything more than some rudimentary marketing and administrative tactics and strategies. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is in any case, fairly well executed and implemented; you won't find the characters doing utterly pointless actions or going on completely fruitless endeavours. Although, like they say, don't judge a book by its cover, because first arc of Log Horizon can mislead you on the show's main focus. Without spoiling too much, they first go on a rescue mission and the short arc serves as an exposition of sorts to give us a gist of the combat and gameplay mechanics, which while not a central theme, does get some focus later on in the series. Even so, combat is not heavy in Log Horizon. When there is action, it mostly relies on tactics and strategy. There is no one-man show where the mc's love overrides the game mechanics or anything. But, if you forget the two arcs where action is important - Log Horizon is about economics and politics at its core.  \\n\\n\r\nOne significant factor that differentiates Log Horizon from its thematic predecessors like SAO and .hack series is that death  in the game does not equate to death in real life. That is, the players can respawn infinitely. It is not without consequence though, as there is something even more terrible than death that await the players who carelessly let their HP bars easily chip away to zero.  Oops, I said too much. Maybe you should go watch the anime, because I won't be dropping any more spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the sound. The OST at first didn't at all sit well with me. It was sharply contrasting to the shows feel and theme. However, slowly but surely, I ended up loving it and started humming along. I can't honestly speak in-depth about the back-ground score...But they were certainly mood building, though I have my doubts about whether they went overboard with it. Some of the mood-building has gone to water and left me with a facepalm because the epic moments were made epic only because of the soundtracks. Without those, I wouldn't have batted an eye at the game winning strategies the characters employed and would have wrote them off as common sense. Meanwhile, the ending has already found a place in my favorites. Never skipped it, infact, I'm listening to it as I'm typing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was quite mediocre. Nothing to speak of. Its not too bad and its not too good. I felt that it didn't quite feel like a game for most part. But you really can't complain, for all we know, they may not even be stuck in a game per se. The character designs were pretty generic and all of anime's usual motifs are used. I particularly liked the mc's design. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters of Log Horizon are not unique or spectacular in any sense. But they get their job done, and the mc is a wits above fists guy for once, and he's good at it. There is also the charismatic guy who gets all the praise, but luckily, we see him as a side character for the better part of the show. Not really surprising given Log Horizon takes a radically different route than most mainstream shounen shows by focusing on the action behind the scenes far more than the frontline adventures. \\n\\n\r\nI have noticed the characters getting blamed for reacting too calmly towards their predicament and this is one of those criticisms I don't understand. If you came across such a criticism, take my word - that is baseless. Completely baseless.\\n\\n\r\nOne character I was thoroughly disappointed with was the loli assassin, Akatsuki. I actually had high hopes for her. But much to my dismay, her potential as a character was left untapped in terms of both execution and elucidation. I certainly won't condemn her character for development as she seemed to be wallowing in sadness because of her inability to be of sufficient use, and even more her because of her being unable to empathize with the mc towards the end. She still has a lot of potential for development, especially in the light of next season coming shortly. No, my problem is with her lack of chemistry with the mc. The same slap-stick jokes with the show's resident pervert can get old really easily, and the whole cosplay facade she uses to interact with Shiroe doesn't help either. Heck, Shiroe himself thinks her antics are nothing more than cosplaying when her personal monologues shows that she is invested in Shiroe on a more than superficial level. If there was some backstory for such an introverted personality, then I could have let it slip. But sadly, nothing of that sort came up. I'm hoping that the next season will take some time to flesh out her character, seeing she's the main female lead. \\n\\n\r\nRest of the characters were great for the duration of the show and we can hope that they will play more important roles in the upcoming sequel. Some of the secondary cast got a lot more development than the main cast, both a positive and negative point in my books.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother weakness in its character department comes from overuse of certain gags. Shiroe adjusting his glasses when thinking making everyone go 'Ooohh the villain in glasses', Henrietta's obsession with dressing up lolis, Naotsugu's openly showing perverted tendencies only to get interrupted halfway by wrathful Akatsuki etc being only some of the examples. While this is not uncommon or ineffective, too much of these can be frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, this anime is not for everyone. For those who like dialogue heavy anime that is not dark or depressing, with some light slapstick comedy thrown in for good measure - this is exactly what you're looking for.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a last note, I must warn anyone who has been pushed onto taking up this anime by SAO haters - Granted, its different from SAO and does decidedly better than SAO on the story department, particularly the pacing.  But its not the masterpiece that many of them paint it to be. Log Horizon is a little above the average shounen, however, its still an anime with flaws that cannot be overlooked. My own overall score is a result of the kind of entertainment I derived and not at all reflecting of the show's quality from an objective standpoint.",

            "content": "There is a demographic of people who love to dabble in the virtual world of Massively Multiplayer Online games (MMO) to achieve escapism from stress and other struggles that plague their nature. Recently, there has been somewhat of a resurgence of interest for anime fans to watch shows that detail the life of gamers who play these sorts of games, with Sword Art Online being the forefront of it. These shows detail whether the virtual world could become more real to us than what we initially thought of as real from when we were born should be the central theme for these shows to exploreand bring a fresh new take on it. It\u2019s just too bad that none of these shows in question ever bothered to in the first place and become generic as a result.\\n\\n\r\nA year later we have Log Horizon; an MMO inspired anime that has the same scenario as the show above with only a few minor iterations here and there. Now before I begin, this won\u2019t be a piece where I start to compare or contrast both Sword Art Online and Log Horizon, as many people, unfortunately, seem to be inclined to do so. Whether I think Sword Art Online was good or bad should not be a factor on how I feel about Log Horizon in particular. Judging a show by its own merits without any outside influence of another show should be the number one key in critiquing any work. With that said, does Log Horizon hold out on its own?\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to realize about the plot is the tone of the setting and how it feels very lighthearted despite the dire situation that all of the characters are in. As far as the characters know, they have no way of getting out of the game. Many have criticized this aspect as being somewhat unrealistic in how real people would react to something of this magnitude. It might be an understandable critique to offer, at first. However, as the show goes on it feels fitting based on the nature of how the characters think about how they live and survive in the virtual environment. For however long they\u2019ve been trapped in the game for years on end, at least based on their confusing logic, that virtual world becomes their world and get used to it by then. It also helps to the show\u2019s credit that they don\u2019t ever show us the real world at all and keeps it a mystery as to how things are going to make the situation from the characters\u2019 perspective feel more apparent to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this might be one of the stronger points of the show, the story itself in how it is paced and told isn\u2019t nail-bitingly intuitive or well thought out. The premise isn\u2019t that complicated, to begin with, as we\u2019ve been shown before, but Log Horizon seems to think that if they throw in multiple sub-plots into the mix to make it sound complex, it\u2019ll succeed. Unfortunately, those sub-plots I\u2019d mentioned don\u2019t amount to anything special in the long run and aren\u2019t even that memorable because of it. Not only that, but that lack of memorability stems from the fact that all of these political and social constructs that Log Horizon\u2019s world possesses aren\u2019t written clear enough, other than the fact that they\u2019re there to establish some basis for our protagonists to go somewhere. This comes into perspective with how many characters there are to follow in Log Horizon, but I\u2019ll get to that later. The problems with the world-building might be more apparent after knowing that the original creator, Mamare Touno, was responsible for the creation of Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, which also had the same problems in its adaptation that can be compared to this one. These sorts of issues are prevalent in adaptations in this type of scale, but that can\u2019t be an excuse at this point.\\n\\n\r\nThough the massive cast of characters might seem like a huge negative, the way I put it, that shouldn\u2019t mean that all of them are mediocre. The main cast of characters that are prominent throughout the show is exceptionally likable and hilarious to watch due to their numerous escapades with each other. It helps tremendously how they all have their unique characteristics that improve the nature of every one of them, rather than making them all generic and uninteresting. The same thing can\u2019t be said for the side characters, regrettably so. With our main cast being Shiroe, Nyanta-nyan, Akatsuki, and Naotsugu, there\u2019s this decent sense of chemistry between these four characters that is ultimately lacking for our side/supporting cast. All of their archetypes mostly consist of them having a trait that tries to make them distinct, such as Henrietta having an obsession with cute things like Akatsuki, and Serara, who has a habit of wanting to clean things to calm down. At first, it\u2019s humorous, but after a while it becomes redundant, and it doesn\u2019t make them any more meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nIn an action anime centered around the MMO systems, it would make sense to make the anime feel like you\u2019re really in an MMO game from the gritty details of cool-downs, being a tank, healing your party members equally, and conjuring status effects at the right time. I, myself, am one of these people who enjoy these types of games and, to me, Log Horizon is probably the only one that gets it right. Usually something like this would steer off into brainless shounen show cliches, and there are a few here and there. Amazingly, Log Horizon gets the idea of taking its time for the characters to strategize their movements and actions rather than just blindly fighting off monsters without any thought in the world. That might make it seem too slow or methodical to enjoy watching, but in reality, they do a good job in the pacing of these fight scenes and keeping the action flowing seamlessly to give us a clear picture of what\u2019s going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style can be construed as good, just not excellent in quality. The character designs themselves are very plain and ordinary enough for me even to consider them a triumphant success in artistic merit, but we come to expect that, and for what it\u2019s worth, it handles it decently to where they don\u2019t seem to cut any visible corners in the later episodes. As I\u2019ve mentioned about the action being fast and flawlessly executed, the animation is a big part of why those are the case. The fluid character movements feel nice and kinetic to the spells that are cast and look pretty good as a result.\\n\\n\r\nVoice talents range from relatively unknown voice actors to the familiar ones we\u2019ve grown to be fans of giving their artistic liberties to full effect with Log Horizon. Emiri Kato as Akatsuki is devilishly cute and her being a fellow MMO fan sort of gives her performance an exciting spin. Even though Henrietta wasn\u2019t that special as a character, Ayahi Takabaki manages to pull off the mature woman voice well and gives her voice some new territory for her to explore for her vocal talents rather than more boyish female characters. Takuma Terashima proves himself worthy of being the main protagonist of a show, and I hope to see him do more shortly. Not to mention, I could listen to Jouji Nakata say anything with the word \u201cnyaa\u201d at the end of his sentences and never get tired of it.\\n\\n\r\nFor some of us who are fans of the MMO genre, Log Horizon should be the one show to be doing it right, and while it does handle the actual MMO aspects brilliantly, the real narrative and storytelling sets itself down from being great. I do appreciate the amount of depth it tries to convey that wants us to feel attached to the world, yet I can\u2019t help but wonder if that could\u2019ve been done to better effect had it made the narrative more tightly constructive and less cluttered. The saying, \u201cToo many cooks spoil the broth,\u201d sums up Log Horizon perfectly. Only when the eventual sequel comes out, we will know if the journey will be worthwhile enough to experience its next climax.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-\\n",

            "content": "There are certain degrees to which MMROPG series are adapted these days. While not an original concept, Log Horizon has been unanimously compared to another popular series known as Sword Art Online. It\u2019s almost unavoidable considering both series are based off a light novel and relates to character in an MMORPG setting \u2013 an open world based off a video game. But really, that\u2019s all there is to it and the similarities ends there. Log Horizon isn\u2019t a rip off of SAO, .//hack franchise, or anything else relating to the MMOROPG theme. It\u2019s a show that shines in its own way that makes its pointin the horizons.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon is an anime adapted series based off the light novel of the same name written by Mamare Touno. The setting takes place in a virtual world known as \u2018Elder Tale\u2019. Log Horizon follows the story of a young man known as Shiroe who has earned a reputation in the community. His nickname \u201cShiroe the Strategist\u201d fits his title exactly as such because of his analytical skills and abilities of intellect. Together with his companions, they take on this world that blurs between the lines of fiction and reality.\\n\\n\r\nAs a MMORPG series, Log Horizon adapts many of its concepts relating to the fantasy realm. Nothing in Elder Tale is real but they have their own mechanics. These include but is not limited to various classes players can adapt their roles in, monster categories, economic/politic aesthetics, and world concepts. In fact, the world that Log Horizon is based on is colored with all sorts of fantasy attributes; goblins, murlocs, gryphons to just name a few. More importantly is the fact that the world itself also has its own rules such as penalties, death/respawns, pking, etc. On many chances, Log Horizon follows a suit of narrative through which mechanics are explained thoroughly to give viewers insights. These narratives often goes over background information and how exactly certain notions function. Log Horizon presents this flawlessly because it both tell and shows its mechanics firsthand. It brings out its best when the show follows the concepts of actual MMORPG mechanics. As a former MMORPG player, I am pleased to see this such concepts being explored. More so, Log Horizon also focuses on world building with its construction of its fictional universe. It aims to inform, presents it, and delivers.\\n\\n\r\nSeries based off of MMORPG often incorporates a large cast of characters. Log Horizon is no stranger to a large cast. Most prominently however are our main protagonists of the guild \u2013 Log Horizon. Shiroe, Naotsugu, Akatsuki, Nyanta, Minori, Tohya, and Isuzu makes up this group of players and together stands as a unity to face their world. Even from the first episode, there\u2019s a sudden degree of chemistry between each member that can attract viewers to see how it develops. On a technical level, each character has their own personalities and more importantly, a class and level. This is important as each class has a skill of its own as well as a sub-class that is imperative for a guild to survive. For example, Akatsuki\u2019s class is \u2018assassin\u2019 with a sub-class of \u2018tracker\u2019. Both of these functions well in stealth missions where infiltration and gathering information is significant to ensure a guild\u2019s success. Log Horizon demonstrates this well on various degrees by testing the limits of these classes for both its advantages and flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe series functions well in terms of storytelling on most parts. Every episode offers something new to the audience with its game mechanics whether it\u2019s combat, politics, or even culinary. While the series does have its concept of survival, it doesn\u2019t just focus on that exclusively. Rather, its formula consists of various degrees of concepts that connects the story as a whole. It focuses on an internal level of struggle and warfare that sets Log Horizon as a unique series. Furthermore, it also engineers the overall theme of the plot and doesn\u2019t go overboard with its comedy, drama, or even romance. Of course, there is also action offered which brings the show to life with its sequences. What makes it more entertaining and attractive is the way characters engage in combat with their skills based off their classes. Even players in a party such as healers play prominent roles and no one is left in the dust. There is also no player that plays the role of an overpowered protagonist or break through impossible circumstances through deus ex machina. The concepts and mechanics are explained beforehand and applies when the time calls for it. \\n\\n\r\nEven though Log Horizon is the main guild that is explored throughout the series, it doesn\u2019t just focus on them. Supporting characters also get their spotlights with their own classes, levels, and secrets. There\u2019s a degree of connection that the audience can relate to.  There\u2019s no random fan service or the typical cliche of the accidental bath walk-ins that sets no relations. As a fan of MMORPG games, I appreciate its presentation that focuses supporting characters and not just its core players. Even NPCs (non-playable player) gets its exploration that is intuitive. And as a MMORPG based off setting world, it doesn\u2019t forget to add the idea of PKers \u2013 player killers. It\u2019s a common sight to see and offers a threat for players to face beyond just the world and its creatures. \\n\\n\r\nAs fantastic as it sounds, Log Horizon is by no means a perfect series. Fantasy wise, the world of Elder Tale adapts itself well but hard to take it at heart. It quirks into silliness with its high dosage of comedy that makes it hard to take the show seriously on occasions. Demonstrated by its cartoonish designs, most of the characters lacks any features of impressive design. Akatsuki is also advertised as a young girl with a cute face but dangerous nature which is ironic since her age contrasts greatly with her appearance. Her devotion to Shiroe, or rather in her words \u201cprotecting her lord\u201d can get repetitive and lacks substance. Essentially, Akatsuki suffers from developments and characterization. And from some flashbacks are shown, most of the main characters\u2019 backgrounds are only briefly touched and vaguely touched upon. It leaves viewers in the dark as to how our characters became the players are they are in Log Horizon. Finally, the connection between the players in the game and their real life counterparts is completely omitted leaving viewers in the dark on their origins.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some of these drawbacks, Log Horizon still offers impressive features to take notice of. From minute one, the show focuses on its theme and doesn\u2019t venture far off of it. The world of Elder Tale also presents location that is credible such as the natural mountains, the ruined cities (that resembles past civilization), fresh breathing beaches, and dampening caverns. There\u2019s a sense of reality that the audience might relate to if they have played MMORPG games in the past. It adapts itself based on these themes where Log Horizon and should be endeared.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of Log Horizon strikes as a make or break situation. By credibility, it works out very well with adapting its fantasy style of Elder Tale. Satelite studios previously were involved with other fantasy series such as Guin Saga, Arata Kangatari, and Fairy Tail. Here, they make the show believable with its artwork designs at the surface level. On other hand, character designs sometimes becomes distracting and hard to take seriously with their designs. Akatsuki is perhaps the character that stands out the most with her appearance as an assassin but nothing else strikes more than her as that. This same applies to Shiroe with his geeky like appearance that acts as the brainiac of the group. They just seems to be there with its blend background. However, Nyanta is one character to take notice of because of its feline features that really defines the fantasy atmosphere to what Log Horizon is. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise, Log Horizon strikes as an outstanding feature. Beginning with the OP song, the show defines itself with the theme of \u201cDatabase\u201d that blurs between lines of fiction and reality. Most characters\u2019 voices fits their roles well with some that defines their characters more than others such as Nyanta. The OST also performs at a level that matches scenes whether it strikes as important, emotional, cinematic, or comical. The ED song also reflects a more innocent theme with Akatsuki as its main mascot.\\n\\n\r\nAs a former MMORPG player, I appreciate the way Log Horizon presented itself. Rather than just going with a concept of the typical virtual war trope or saving the world, Log Horizon sets its basis on a foundation of mechanics that is presented in an exquisite way. Not only is it accurate to the basis of an MMORPG setting but the characters themselves drives the story with their adequate roles. Log Horizon also likes to focus on various degrees of politics and economics to explore its insight on a more intellectual level. It also adapts world building concepts that becomes a focus to drive the story forward. It explores territory an MMORPG exactly as it should be and doesn\u2019t lose track. On some technical note, it can take some time to get used to the artwork. Comedy can also strike as a hit or miss depending on your preferences. Still, the end game is that Log Horizon is an unique series. It\u2019s not a clone of Sword Art Online or does it leave audience confused. In fact, you\u2019ll likely be forming your own theories as each episode progresses relating to its world and characters. It\u2019s appreciable that Log Horizon can adapts so many concepts into the show as an industrial revolution of success.\\n",

            "content": "Log Horizon is an enormous failure of a show from both an analytical and an MMO-lover\u2019s standpoint. It is so incredibly juvenile, yet unfitting for children due to its jokes on perversion, lolis, and whatnot. Before you stop reading, know at least that I used to love MMOs, and I really wanted to like this show. Alas, Log Horizon is simply too plain, too banal, and too full of itself for any serious anime-viewer to not have their intelligence insulted by it. \r\nLog Horizon is about a group of adventurers trapped inside Elder Tale, a massively multiplayer online role playing game (henceforth simplified as MMO)world. \\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the intentions for using an MMO setting is extremely dubious. The entrapment\u2019s impact on the characters is diminutive \u2013 they seem almost impassive to their predicament. Such unnatural behavior is visibly a deliberate attempt by the author to ignore the existence of and any connections to the real world. The choice of integrating of MMO elements with a fantasy world, rather than setting the story in a traditional one, is naught more than pandering to its audience. The lack of any sexual fanservice is completely made up for by the fact that the entire show is fanservice to people who blindly enjoy seeing gaming elements in their anime, no matter the quality. The MMO-integration is not used as a device to set up or advance the plot \u2013 it is the plot that is blatantly abused for its MMO-fanservice. As a show that lets its gimmicky premise unnaturally dictate the entire narrative rather than using the premise as a means to set up the desired story, Log Horizon was bound to failure from the very beginning. \\n\\n\r\nFor being a fanservice show, Log Horizon seems to not know its audience. It is not correctly aimed at MMO-players as it goes to great lengths to explain the most rudimentary mechanics as if they are great revelations. It might have been somewhat forgivable if such moments were limited in occurrence or length, but they seem to be half the point of the entire series. It would take half an episode to bestow upon its viewers the great insight that is the teamwork between two people which encompassed almost an entire five abilities. Another half episode would then be used to drop the indescribably eye-opening revelation that different members of a team could fill different roles in a team (!!!!). I cannot imagine anyone that has played a MMO for a more than a couple of hours deriving any sort of pleasure from such juvenilities. If on the other hand Log Horizon\u2019s aim is to show people unfamiliar with MMO games the beauty of such games, however unlikely that is, it is nonetheless painting an erroneous and simplified picture of them. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Log Horizon are unbearably bland; each one of them are derived from overused stereotypes, and little effort is spared to develop them beyond their archetypes. There is the scheming bespectacled guy(with a self-insertion quality of kindness), the tiny loli girl, the perverted best friend, the seductive gentleman, the scheming glasses woman(who in a brilliant display of creativity was gifted with a love for abusing lolis) and so on, the characters show no depth or any signs of subtle development throughout the series.  The loli assassin Akatsuki is the epitome of Log Horizons disastrous characterization. She is implied to be the second most important character of the show, yet after 15 episodes she has filled no apparent purpose in the storyline apart from acting out the duties of a loli, i.e. being cute, being abused by loli lovers, and looking up to others. Any other role that she fills are of such insignificance that it becomes apparent the author is just trying to justify her existence in the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnother major problem of Log Horizon is how lacking in self-consciousness it is. Being an exceedingly inane show, the author astoundingly seems to think that it is bursting with intelligence and wit. It goes through significant troubles to build up atmosphere and anticipation for the characters\u2019 cunning plots, which always turn out either completely juvenile or utterly predictable. Each of these moments are accompanied by cornily dramatic voice-acting, clich\u00e9d shifts of tone in art, and overly intense background music, which all contribute to making the already bland show outright ludicrous.\\n\\n\r\nPlease excuse my poor writing which is more rant than review; it is difficult to contain my disappointment in Log Horizon. I was not expecting quality writing or engaging themes; I merely enjoy seeing MMO elements in anime and hoped for an enjoyable show. I could never have imagined the disaster that it turned out to be. While not completely devoid of value, the flaws simply outweigh anything the show does right. Log Horizon may be slightly better in craft than Sword Art Online, but it lacks the trainwrecking fun that SAO had to offer. There is simply no reason to watch Log Horizon.\\n",

            "content": "Log Horizon is the newest \"stuck in a video game world\" anime. Many people claimed before it began that it would be just like the extremely popular and hyped up \"Sword Art Online.\" However, the first episode is enough to dispel any kind of belief that these two shows have anything in common. Take away the video-game-style fantasy setting, and comparing these two shows is like comparing an action/romance anime to a slice of life anime.\r\nLog Horizon follows more of the slice of life route taking a laid-back and slower pace than many other fantasy anime where people are fighting for survival. In the beginning,the players of a video game called \"Elder Tale\" are transported into the game world when a new expansion is released. While surprised and worried at first, they cope with this major problem and decide to adjust to their world rather than try to find the exit immediately. Since people do not actually die when they are killed, there's really not much to worry about. The only main problem is that food and water have no taste, that fighting in the actual world is vastly different from fighting from behind a computer screen, and that some guilds are now taking advantage of new players caught up in the confusion.\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist, Shiroe, is a genius strategist and is at the highest possible level in Elder Tale (as are many elite players). Along with the perverted tank (a person in an RPG who takes hits and protects his allies) Naotsugu and the female assassin Akatsuki, they begin to unravel the mysteries of this world and discover what has changed now in Elder Tale. From saving friends to making hamburgers to protecting entire villages from being pillaged, they are experiencing a whole new world than the one they became so accustomed to playing.\\n\\n\r\nBut, in my opinion, it's just kind of boring. The story's slow pacing drags on parts I wish had not lasted so long, the characters hardly develop at all aside from a group of novice players, and the show ends announcing a season 2 after an anticlimactic finale.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I say any more negatives, I should highlight on one aspect this show does well: the NPCs (non-playable characters). This refers to the people known as \"People of the Land\" in the Elder Tales game. The anime does an excellent job of showing the differences between the \"adventurers\" (people transported into the game world) and the NPCs and how the NPCs are really an entirely different species than the adventurers. This becomes a major plot point in the second half of the series, which was very nice even though that part did drag a little. It's just something I've never seen done before, nor have I ever really considered before (aside from wondering why people in Pokemon and other games never do anything but say one line and stand still their entire lives occasionally giving you random stuff).\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is very large, but hardly anyone gets much screen time. Shiroe is about the only character you can expect to see in even two-thirds of the total episodes doing anything remotely important to the plot. Naotsugu is just kind of there doing nothing, Akatsuki occasionally has some cute moments and does a little spying, and Nyanta's just that guy who ends every sentence the same annoying way. I actually found myself enjoying watching the group of novice players learning to fight together better than I enjoyed watching the main characters and other experienced supporting characters. Aside from Shiroe's planning, the main cast offers hardly anything of interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is noticeably cheap. Some scenes look great while others are just a mess. The character designs are especially poorly animated most of the time as the animators seemed to prefer to save their budget for the scenes that emphasize the beauty of the fantasy game world instead. Even without the poor animation, I did not care much for the character designs. The facial designs were too sharp with shadows sharply defining the boundaries between different parts of the face. Some of the outfits were interesting, like Akatsuki's and Shiroe's, but most seemed very boring considering the wide variety that should be offered in an MMORPG.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one of the better aspects of the show. It may not be done by Yuki Kajiura like in SAO, but it still fits the fantasy world very well and especially fits the moments when Shiroe is scheming. It mostly consists of different string instruments and a few rock tracks during the action scenes (though there's not too many of those).\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy Log Horizon as much as I was expecting. I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I still stand by it. It's just an average show in almost every way (except the way it portrays NPCs) and is fairly forgettable. Not as much happens over the course of 25 episodes as you might think would happen and the characters really needed some better development (and no, forcing a small amount of romance with 3 episodes to go is not development).",

The author's approach on the subject of assimilation, which I personally felt SAO lacked, left me thoroughly satisfied with political and historical based struggles of settlement, such as laws, and cultural integration between Adventurers (Players) andPeople of the Land (NPC's).\\n\\n\r\nBeing a fan and enjoying both series, I will confidently state that I honestly enjoyed Log Horizon more than Sword Art Online as a more unique and thoroughly written and well developed storyline.",

            "content": "Log Horizon is very good anime it approaches the game genre in different. Most people say that log horizon is a virtual reality which it is not. It's a PC game that been going on for longer than a decade. SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT, There is a scene in the anime where it shows the opening screen on a desktop. They also show scene of the actual game through out the series and the game has the graphic of Runescape. Therefore it is not a VRMMORPG like SAO or Accel World.\r\nStory: 10\r\nIncredibly well done. Unlike sword art online they find out that this world isa lot like ours except with magic. NPC's are talk and act like humans and a lot of times they are considered humans. There is no logout button unlike SAO and AW so they have no idea how to leave this world or even if there is a way to leave this worlds. Very original story amazingly done\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI thought art could of done a little better. For example if you pay close attention to certain characters (mainly the main protagonist(Shiro)) you notice facial feature such as jaw lines, unshapely forehead, and the chin line are the most prominent to me they don't look right. Besides the minor facial features it Very amazing art.\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nLH has one of my favorite Sound Track but what really gets me is the battle sounds. For example, one of the scene has a huge battle in an enclose cavern and you hear every rock that fell, every spell that cast and its hit, Slashing of the swords and sounds the characters make through out the battle. Incredibly great audio. One of the best I've seen.\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEvery Character has a perfect character development, especially Shiro. As the Shows move forward you find out Shiro can be very devious and cunning with his actions. He tricks, confuse and even play mind games with people to get his way yet he never lies. Very good development with Characters.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nVery action pack with incredible fight scenes Adventure's through ever changing land and a magical world just waiting to be found. If you enjoy Action, Adventure and fantasy genre's you'll love this one.\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 10",

            "content": "A review for Log Horizon, a show that for a long time has been my favourites, and is currently the only show I've ever fully rewatched. The 2nd season is a different story for me, but this is the first one, and this is the Log Horizon I love.\r\nThis review includes spoilers from only the early episodes, so I can freely explain the plot of the story.\r\nStory: Plot 4/5, Development 5/5, Total 9/10\r\nIn the first episode Shiroe, a gamer that has been playing Elder Tale for soon 8 years finds out he is locked inside his game world. He goes on to find his friendNaotsugu and meets up with an assassin called Akatsuki. In hope of finding out more about this world he now lives in, he goes north on a quest to find Serara, a girl from his friend's Marielle's guild.\\n\\n\r\nThe great thing about the plot is that it is unique, and also not that straight-forward compared to Sword Art Online. What I mean is that you can't see the end of the series in the first episode, and I think that is a great aspect in series. I find motivation to watch the series when I don't know what'll happen and thats why I think the plot of this series is great.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the development - the story goes all different ways. On Shiroe's journey(and in the arcs that don't include Shiroe) you will see all aspects of the Elder Tale community and how it's changed. Shiroe is a man of action, and though there aren't fights all the time Shiroe is always fighting. Some might consider the end of the season weak, but I think it's a great introduction to the second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Animation 2/5, Design 4/5, Total 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Log Horizon is cheap, and the battle scenes are weak(That's probably why we don't see a lot of them). How ever, some fights are still in battle and though the fights dont bring out a lot of visuals they add to the enjoyment in many different ways. The design is very nice and the Elder Tale world is bright and pretty. Later in the show the art suffers, maybe something like a degradation in production work(maybe because of a small budget?) and the things we liked dissapear.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Voices 3/4, OP/ED 0/2, OST 4/4, Total 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voices in the show are mostly on-point, though there were some misfits and I notice the voices are sometimes over-done and sound a bit stupid, though were few of these flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening for this series is a good song, though it's a minus that I can't say \"The Openings\" since there only is one, and you only like it for a while, since in the beginning you think it's too repetetive and in the end of the show you get tired of it. I dislike Loli(a lot) and though I like some J-pop songs this one didn't cut it for me.\\n\\n\r\nFor the OST, this is the best part. It's the main OST, the one where you know Shiroe, our MC is going to f*** s*** up, a happy one, and a couple of neutral ones. Some are done by orchestra's and your ears recieve a great massage in every episode. I absolutely loved the OST for this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/5 Design, 5/5 Development, Total 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters in Log Horizon might seem like clich\u00e8 anime characters to some, but they all have their play in the anime and they all add greatly to a nice community of Log Horizon where all the small chit chats add to the enjoyment. Now for the main characters;\\n\r\nShiroe - Our main protagonist, a university student in his middle twenties, also the strategist of the Legendary \"Debauchery Tea Party\". He is friendly but people call him \"The Villain in Glasses\" because of his drastic choices and amazing plans.\\n\r\nAkatsuki - A loli ninja that includes roleplay in Elder Tale even after the day they all moved into Log Horizon, making Shiroe her master.\\n\r\nNaotsugu - A pervert Guardian that used to be a part of Shiroe's party, being on all the big raids. He also knows Shiroe in real life.\\n\r\nNyanta - Also a roleplayer after the Apocalypse, the half-cat man is referred to as \"Chief\" by Shiroe, Naotsugu and others that used to be a part of the Debauchery Tea Party. Little of his backstory is revealed, though something hints to that he teached Shiroe the game when he was starting out.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the development of the characters, where Log Horizon really outdoes itself. We have development arc's that greatly tell us about the supporting characters and the main characters, we are introduced to traits that we didn't know the characters had and you won't say \"That character is normal, just like me\" just like you would compare yourself to Kirito of SAO, who only does what is ethically correct. The characters develop and move further as they find out more about this world of Elder Tale, especially Shiroe, as a lot of the story is based on his choices.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThough the production is not of the highest quality, I loved this show and I had to rewatch it, since there was so much fuel driving me. All the lovely characters, the story engaging you to go further, episode by episode and the amazing OST of course.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm putting an 8/10 here since I feel this show deserves it, but I have a 9/10 on my list because Log Horizon really has a soft spot for me. Sorry if the review was a bit one-sided.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to put some recommendations at the bottom; If you've only watched shounen and want to try something new, try \"Haikyuu!\", a sports anime about volleyball. If you want to watch another great shounen anime, I'd gladly recommend \"Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakaritsu\", you can read up on the story on another review because it's a bit hard for me to explain.\\n\\n\r\nHope you liked the review!",

            "content": "This anime is one that I went in with mixed expectations. I had heard it was like Sword Art Online, which I found to be 'okay' , I was not a rabid hater nor a blind fanboy... but there parts of it I really liked and others I really disliked. Now when I started Log Horizon I did so with an open mind, not expecting a retread of SAO but also expecting at least some level of similitude and that might be the biggest mistake I made.\r\n(Some very minor spoilers ahead, nothing big I promise)\r\nSTORY:\r\nHere is the big problem with this series. It is pacedatrociously and sets up many subplots that don't seem to add up but that is a minor qualm. The main issue is that although it takes place in a world with dangerous beasts and hostile humans, there is absolutely nothing at stake. It is established very early on that there is no risk of permanent death as characters will just respawn in another part of the world, add to this there is easy access to food and shelter. This effectively de-claws any threat that can possibly occur which I thought was an interesting direction to take the story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, immediately after establishing this, there are several story arcs wherein a character needs to be rescued from danger completely contradict the established lore of the world. There is no danger, there are no stakes, fights are irrelevant. Now I understand that that's the point, but you cannot take away all danger and then tell us a character is in danger. That destroys the premise of the story, especially when said character is running away in terror (You'll know what I'm talking about if you watch the series).\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of SAO, especially early, was the fact that everything was dangerous. There was a very oppressive atmosphere and each action had weight. Here is completely the opposite, nothing matters and because of this,  I found it very difficult to become invested in the story when there is nothing to risk, nothing to gain.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major problem is that the characters are already high level, again this is established very, very early so I am not spoiling anything. One of the major draws to an MMORPG is seeing how a character changes and grows, removing this aspect is neutering a huge draw to the concept. They wrote a completely flat and dull premise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI found the sound serviceable. The performances of the seiyuus were adequate, although I found Akatsuki's voice somewhat annoying but that is purely subjective.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n Character:\\n\r\nAnd here is another major problem. An anime can have a weak or even no story, as long as the characters are strong and have good interaction. In this anime the characters are very generic and bland, the main character is a Wizard equivalent to Kirito, that is to say, a character with unusually high intelligence, designed to appeal to a demographic of individuals that fancy themselves intellectuals. But the character himself is little more than wish fulfillment, which in and of itself is not a bad thing but it is done very poorly. This character is worshiped by those that surround him right from the beginning of the series and this only increases. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy interactions are very forced and the dramatic scenes come off as more comedic. They simply could not find a balance for Shiroe's over 9000 intellect, Akatsuki's strange roleplaying and Nao's bumbling. These characters are unable to carry this anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nEarlier I mentioned I had mixed expectations, that is because I had a bad experience with SAO and hoped for something to wash the taste from my mouth. Watching this anime left me with an entirely different bad taste in my mouth. I honestly wanted to like it at the beginning, but it slowly removed everything I wanted to see in favor of everything I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of MMORPGs, this anime is not for you.\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of action, this anime is not for you.\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of high fantasy and adventure, this anime is not for you.",

            "content": "Hello buddies, why don\u2019t we have a little chit chat over Log Horizon.\r\nLog Horizon is an adaptation of a manga written by the fabulous Touno Mamare. Maybe you already knew him as the creator of Maoyuu Mao Yuusha, which by the way really is something.\r\nThe anime adaptation is directed by Ishihira Shinji who works on Fairy Tail\u2019s adaptation, and some Full Metal \u2019O\u2019 God Alchemist (Brotherhood version of course).\r\nNow that the bases are set, let\u2019s start the review.\r\n   Story: 9\r\nThe main lines are pretty simple. \r\nDue to the arrival of a new expansion pack, a bunch of players are transported into a gamenamed \u201cElder Tale\u201d. In this mess, we are following the daily life of Shiroe and his friends through various situations and challenges.\\n\\n\r\nActually these lines could remind you of SAO (Sword Art Online). Buuuut (you should have expected it :D), the story is way more developed. In fact, where SAO was just barely trying to add some depth to the story, Log Horizon is perfectly managing to create plots in plots through other plots.\\n\r\nEach episode of Log Horizon adds to the plot, which is mainly about the players adjusting to their new world.\\n\\n\r\nThere is something you may keep in mind, this anime is made by Touno Mamare and this is what is really making the difference. If you\u2019ve seen \u201cMaoyuu Mao Yuusha\u201d it\u2019s really really similar. We don\u2019t have pretty much action but it\u2019s still intense.\\n\r\nThis is also reminding me of \u201cSpice & Wolf\u201d (Ookami to Koushinryou) in many ways because it\u2019s not based on pure action but it\u2019s still considered.\\n\\n\\n\r\n   Art/Sound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe work made on the anime is pretty incredible.\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the music here. Opening and ending are both quite good, and the background music is a bit repetitive in the second part of the anime.\\n\r\nThe animations are fluid, but nothing transcendental. \\n\r\nIn a general manner Art is pretty good but could have it improved a bit. They could have made it more like MMY but whatever.\\n\r\nThe thing that made my marked it 8 is the work made on the UI they used in the game. When I\u2019m thinking about augmented reality games I imagine it like that and I don\u2019t feel like they are making fun of my gamer side :)\\n\\n\r\n   Character:  10 \\n\\n\r\nThe character building is pretty impressive too. All the character have a real personality, even if we found the stereotype of all anime (loli, tsundere,..) each character of this anime is important. Even secondary and supporting characters are important. Each of them gives a little plus to the anime.\\n\r\nMoreover Shiroe (the main character) got a really interesting chara design, his personality and action are evolving in an interesting manner.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI feel like I could watch it again and again and I\u2019m eager for the second season which is pretty rare for me.\\n\r\nSome moments are really delightful, other tears you in half.\\n\r\nI really love anime that make me laugh or make me shed tears. And Log Horizon is one of them.\\n\r\nI discovered it by serendipity and after watching I feel like watching \u201cSpice & Wolf\u201d which is one of my favorite anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n   Overall: 9,25\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t feel like marking it 9 because I really enjoyed watching Log Horizon and I\u2019m really eager for the 2nd season.\\n\r\nYou should watch it if:\\n\r\n-You\u2019ve enjoyed watching SAO\\n\r\n-You\u2019ve enjoyed Spice & Wolf and Maoyou Mao Yuusha\\n\r\n-You want a SAO like with a real half season  :DDD\\n\\n\r\nYou shouldn\u2019t watch if:\\n\r\n-You want only action and to put your brain away\\n\r\n-You can\u2019t stand waiting for a 2nd season to come out \\n\r\n-You are an alien\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my 1st review and have a good time watching anime :)\\n",

            "content": "Let's speak about Log Horizon: an anime that tells about, for the most part, the adventures of the characters trapped in a virtual world; definitely very pleasant for those who appreciate the genre, but with some underlying defects that can not be ignored ... But let's start, analyzing, specifically, every aspect.\r\nSTORY 5/10: Unfortunately the story is not the strong point of this anime. In fact, in my opinion, it is a bit abstract and lacking in depth, because this does not seem to have a definite starting point and evolves with a certain repetitiveness and carelessness. It's, essentially, a story based on how the charactersmanage to build a society, to deal with the uncomfortable situation of being trapped in the game;  but, indeed, it doesn't give space to something fundamental, or rather to some normal questions that any sane person, in that situation, would pose: '' How can we get back to the real world? Is there a way to do so or not? ''. \\n\r\nPerhaps because, knowing that they probably will not be able to get back to normalcy, they make their best efforts, almost exclusively to make their lives in the virtual word work; But this thing is not specified in the anime and it may just be a mere reflection of mine, and therefore can not be attributed as a strong point of the story.\\n\\n\r\nART 8/10: As for the drawings in general, they are very well made and cared for. The environments are very colorful and bright, almost enticing the viewer to dive in; the graphics of the characters are really well done and linear, and even the animations are well cured and sliding.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 7/10: Very interesting regarding the sound level: the openings and endings are beautiful; pleasant are also the various OSTs present in the anime, and finally they also made a not bad dubbing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7/10: In this anime there is a wide range of characters who are more or less useful, but with the almost total lacking of villains, that kind of annoyed me. Let's start from the main protagonist Shiroe, also known by several nicknames because of his personality, he is definitely the cornerstone of the anime, in fact, thanks to his skills as careful strategist, he will manage to put aside the rivalry between the various guilds and create a good basic society. To help him in this endeavor there will be Akatsuki, a ninja that will strongly  bind to him, and Naotsugu, his longtime friend. Then there will also be many other secondary characters, such as Nyanta, a catman who will have some merits in the culinary field, Marielle, head of one of the guilds, Henrietta, her second (my favorite), and many others that will contribute to make the watching of the anime sliding and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 7/10: I didn't mind this anime, because there have been many moments of hilarity and madness, which made me laugh a lot; for example the way how Shiroe used to get annoyed because of his nicknames, or when Akatsuki was teased by Henrietta etc etc ...\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, it is a partially successful anime, apart for the story which is vacuous and baseless. I strongly hope that these flaws will be resolved in the second season, because I think that this anime has a lot of potential and it would be a shame to make it vain because of a dull story.\\n\r\nIf I were to recommend someone to see whether or not this anime, I would say so, because it is very fun and enjoyable, and it is perhaps this what  makes me close one eye on the defect of the story.\\n",

            "content": "**The character development part of the review is not good.**\r\nYet another MMORPG anime. \r\nPeople always compare LH with Sword Art Online. For me, I cannot find even the slightest similarity between them. They are two completely different show with distinct objectives and focus. I have not started season two as for the time this review was written thus tis purely based on my impression on the first season. All constructive criticisms are welcomed via PM or comment. They will be greatly appreciated. \r\nSTORY (Concept 3.5/5, Development 4/5) Rounded down\r\nThe series starts off with a terribly explained situation: random players get trapped in a fantasy universe.great. massive cliche. In the world of Elder tale, they have absolutely no objective whatsoever and finding a reason to live is extremely challenging. The protagonists along with his companion begin their journey to, uh, no where. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of trying their butt off to get back to the reality, they seem to be okay with their dire situation. This lead to a problem since we tend to forget it is a \"game\", rather than a normal fantasy universe. Yes, things such as game mechanics and the \"death's penalty\" introduced later in the series do remind us of what is going on, but on a grand scheme of things, it becomes rather confusing and pointless. \\n\\n\r\nRather than action-packed fights and emotional rollercoaster, LH decides to take a intellectual route. The establishment of government and the negotiations with other factions are some interesting plot lines that involves multiple characters and they give people reasons to continue watching this show. Although some of the lines are kind of bad paced (princess arc) and misleading (round table), the curiosity (if you have any) will probably make you wonder what will happen to these characters. Some of the stories are somewhat smart, but none of them really clearly communicate the moral message to the audience which makes the entire series feels like a popcorn show. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the show... it feels like a harem anime but I guess I'll let it slide since the majority of the story is considerable interesting. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (Design 5/5, Development 4/5)\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon does not really follow the general formula of adventure-type stories. The typical Adventure consists of a idiotic protagonist and bunch of followers to help him out. In LH however, the characters play their unique role without a sense of \"everybody helps one dude\" feeling. The character designs not complete copycat, but they look pretty familiar. \\n\\n\r\nNotable Characters include Shiroe the mastermind, Akatsuki the bodyguard/lover, Naotsugu the tank and Nyanta is awesome cat. \\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of Lelouch and Light Yagami, I can see the shadows of his predecessors in Shiroe's personality. He is clever, but not to the point where the world trembles beneath him. There isn't really too much of development as I can recall (there is, but they are definitely not notable enough to be noticed or cared), but throughout the series we learn about him gradually. I feel like his mind isn't all that clear in the beginning and at the end I do learn more about him as a complete person. Perhaps that counts as development? \\n\\n\r\nIronic enough I don't feel like any other \"main characters\" have developed at all. Akatsuki changed her opinion toward Shiroe slightly, Naotsugu stays as an dumb tank and Nyanta keeps his image as the big daddy despite how awesome a daddy he is. \\n\\n\r\nThe three little kids have their cliche development and that's pretty much it. reminds me of third Hokage's son's team in Naruto. \\n\r\nThe romance between the princess and Krusty was a very interesting touch. I almost felt like he is the hidden protagonist of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the design is quite unique and interesting and the development are scattered all over the place. I personally like that. All of the characters get a little bit of love. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGRAPHIC (Art 5/5, Animation 2.5/5) Rounded up\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the show is considerably unique. Not all characters have the same face (shout out to SAO) and they are quite comfortable to look at. The armors and clothes have different designs on different persons, each guild has its signature color and style. The background is very beautiful. The art focuses on landscape and the 16th century architecture. Each city has its unique building style and the background. You may not like it, but the effort is there for sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan service in the show is very minimal. (Hurray!) \\n\\n\r\nAh... The animation. The animation is shit. It is just so bad. It was made in 2013, and there shouldn't be any excuse to use simple flashy light to represent most if not all super abilities. The skill control menu panels are quite cool but when you compare them with SAO's... uh... not the most exciting animation and action. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (OP/ED 1.5/3, OST 3/3, Voice 2/4) Rounded down\\n\\n\r\nDATABASE DATABASE DATABASE. This is one of the openings that I will absolutely skip no matter what happens. I wouldn't even consider listening to it just for the sake of appreciation. No, the opening is a very poorly written song that has no connection to the theme of the anime. I can only think of a person who loves repetitive noise booster who would enjoy the song. The ending is very cute. And that's pretty much it. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST however is top tier. The majority of the songs are made of various instruments you can find in a traditional orchestra blended with some electronic addons. The heavy metal feelings and the occasional vocals makes great combo. They give a nice sense of glory. I would say the OST is what carries this production without letting it completely overshadowed on the back of SAO. (Yes, the LH OST is better than SAO's in MY opinion. it is just more engaging and stylish.) \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is plainly average. Every character sound too unemotional and the lack of personal identification fails to give the show a fair atmosphere. That said they are not hard to listen to, it's just not good enough. The Japanese original is actually much better. I personally would recommend sub over dub, but if you hate reading, the dub won't do too much harm on your overall experience. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite the problems I pointed out previously, I find some of the elements especially enjoyable. The big cast of character and the unique way of narrative (we don't know what people are actually thinking) along with the glorious OST is beyond my expectation. The story isn't that good, but it is still considered semi-intellectual which I enjoy, very. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7.5/10) Rounded up \\n\\n\r\nAnimation aside, Log Horizon is a very well made SHOUNEN anime. Tho not brilliant in any particular aspect, the plot is very intriguing. Instead of randomly coming up with ideas one after another, the story built upon each other. With that in mind, I kindly overrate this a little bit since I believe it simply isn't fair for the creators since too many shounen shows are full of fillers and misleading plot/characters. This is definitely one of the shows that is worth checking out and I would say it deserves much more attention/credit than what it is got. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't find this review helpful, please give me some feed back so I can improve my content and give higher quality contribution to the community, thank you! :D\\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "Thunder's Review no.2: Log Horizon\r\nLog Horizon, another anime about gamers trapped in a virtual world. Concept that isn't new to the anime world, long before Sword Art Online there were few anime that tried to satisfy both gaming geeks and anime fans. Does Log Horizon succeed with that? Well, as both a gamer and anime fan I must say that I have mixed opinion about that.\r\nThe Story 6/10\r\nThe beginning is in fact quite interesting. Our main protagonist realize that he can't log out, find some friends and then the story proceed with exactly what it should be doing. It explains how the game(called Elder Tale)is functioning. It helps us getting interested in not only what happens to the characters but even in game world itself. There are even some interesting fights with both players and monsters at the beginning which show us another great merit to the story. Almost every fight throughout the whole show is won with tactics(until some point). Tactics that any MMORPG gamer will be familiar with. Characters are using many MMO terms witch is also a nice touch for the gaming aspect of the series. Besides combat Log Horizon do a great job on explaining basics of a classical MMO game: economy, crafting, NPCs, leveling, dungeons/raids, guilds and etc... It's quite interesting to look at how real people try to take advantage or bypass the rules and how they are trying to get by in this familiar, yet new world.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see I think that Log Horizon handle gaming aspect very well but there are some downsides that simply cannot be ignored. As I wrote, beginning is quite good but it's hard to take the show seriously from the start because no one can die. People are just respawning after death. Eventually it stopped being a problem but it heavily influenced my first impressions, in a negative way. I just couldn't care for the characters that are immortal.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon surely is an anime that concentrate more on talking than anything else. Talking, comedy and rarely combat, especially in the latest part of the show. Shiroe is a real badass and can come up with really awesome master plans but it takes forever for something to happen. After the beginning tempo and lively energy that anime had is lost, pacing is very slow and there are some parts that are straightly BORING. It doesn't help that comedy in a show is on a very low and child-like level. Maybe it's just isn't my sort of humour but I did not find most of the jokes funny at all. Eventually when something happens show gets very good but it just does not feel worth the time spend waiting.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part when I would be trashing the ending but just after the last episode was over there was a communique that we are getting another season very soon, in fall this year. Keeping that in mind I won't judge the ending and save it for another season. I have good feeling about the second season, oh this wind of adventure! UPDATE: Second season was a disappointment :( \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Animations 6/10\\n\r\nLog Horizon have somewhat usual art style. Characters clothes and armor are rather generic fantasy stuff but there are few characters that look better than others with some really awesome gears. My favorite part about the art are backgrounds, sometimes they are really beautiful, they give the feel that it really is a game and a very good looking one. Animations themselves are nothing special but they are solid at least. Unfortunately Log Horizon suffers from the big amount of obvious budget cuts, there are too many still images. Nonetheless overall animation isn't bad and cool backgrounds make it score above average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound 7/10\\n\r\nOverall soundtrack is good and there are few tracks that are better than others, included the main theme which is probably my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nOver dramatic opening was awesome featuring very good song \"Database\" by Man with a Mission. Opening suited the show perfectly and I would definitely put it somewhere on my top anime openings list. Ending song was good (really, girls with umbrellas dominated that season endings) and so was voice acting featuring many talented people.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters 7/10\\n\r\nLog Horizon have a huge and diverse cast of characters. Despite huge amount of characters, they all feel somewhat needed and even some lesser supporting characters are given decent character development. Of course show focuses on some characters more than the others and we get to know chosen few quite well when the rest are there just to interact with them. Almost all characters are easily likeable, not included villains. Also our main protagonist is a real bad ass, and by bad ass I mean that he is a very smart individual that everybody can rely on. Not some cowardly looser that just happened to be a hero. Shiroe is a hero that world of Elder Tale needs, but not the one that it deserve. He is a real Dark Knight \"Villain With Glasses\" just as he's called. The rest of the main and supporting cast is okay, but there are no other on Shiroe's level of coolness. There are also some forced romances, actually few of them but as usually with shows with PG13 they are going nowhere. And as I wrote before I did not liked most of the humor that this shows characters represent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nFrom the beginning Log Horizon really caught my interest few episodes in and I enjoyed gaming part of it but later it was just getting worse and worse as everything took forever to happen. I really enjoyed some moments of the show, sometimes bigger parts but in the end bad comedy and simple boredom almost made me drop it. Gladly I did not drop it and will be waiting for second season but as of now it is kind of mixed experience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nMy feelings about the show are mixed, but I have hope(and I was let down). Log Horizon still have potential to be much better, I certainly will be watching the next season this fall. Hopefully Shiroe will have something really good up in his sleeve.(he hadn't, don't bother with second season)",

            "content": "While Log Horizon may not end up being in the list of favorite shows all too many times, and while majority of its characters won't have a long-lasting impact on the audience, it still manages to be a fun ride with occasional fantastic moments as well as some downfalls which all eventually balance themselves out.\r\nWhen I first found out about the show, I, as many probably have, instantly thought \"Oh look, carbon copy of SAO. *sigh*\". Still, as I scrolled through some opinions, a lot of people have said that Log Horizon plays out as SAO should have. I'll leave that to your own decisionsand instead will focus on Log Horizon as an separate entity in the anime world. \\n\\n\r\nLH follows Shioru, our main protagonist who suddenly finds himself locked in a world of \"Elder Tale\", massively popular MMORPG with over twenty million people worldwide. He soon forms a party of three, with Akatskui, honorable shinobi who shall always follow her lord and knee the pervert, Naotsugu. Fortunately, that is not where the cast ends and we are soon introduced to heavy array of characters, ranging from veterans to beginners, each given enough time so we can learn something about them. Unfortunately, not all of them are that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of LH works as a cohesive unit, but what really struck me was the world building. It really did feel as if the author invested a lot of time into making a specific world which does resemble that of MMORPGs - oftentimes, before the OP, we're given some information about the world and its rules which serves its purpose of introducing us, or rather helping us dig further in as to what kind of a world Elder Tale forms. Without spoiling too much, the story of LH is somewhat divided into short arcs, each one way or the other connected to the overall plot which comes into focus later on. Each separate entity is enough fun for itself and the mysteries introduced, especially the characters, are enough to keep your attention on. Overall, story was well above decent, albeit nothing too masterful. It did its job and it did it well.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to production department, I'd call it the weakest part of the anime. Visuals are often stiff, animation often lacks impact and even battles, albeit exciting, aren't as good as in other similar shows. Even though character designs vary, it does feel as if too many characters are similar and/or act in similar fashion which is oftentimes just a sore. Another gripe I have with the show is the sound and all its merits. Some VA did a fine job representing their characters while I wouldn't be so certain when it comes to rest. There are, sometimes, weird pauses during their speeches which don't fit their character. The soundtrack itself was sorely lacking though; there is maybe 1 or 2 memorable themes while others are barely noticeable at best. I do feel that the soundtrack and the sound overall could have been given more time, especially because of the settings. Some spells, for instance, Astral Howl, do have that visual and sound impact while others ... well, don't. They're too generic. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of LH are ... well, some are decent, some are rather good and some are just plain unnecessary. Shirou, our main character, is a good spin on the \"all powerful MC\". Although anime, or rather characters within anime world, try to sell him as this almighty entity, we soon realize that he's just an above-average intelligent student with enough capacity to work with the information he gets. It's a nice spin and I did like his character overall. The other duo, faithful shinobi and open pervert did their job as a good support and humorous pair. Sometimes they'll get at your nerves, but more so than not they're quite likable. When it comes to the rest of the cast, I'll be honest: it's not that great. Especially the children, or the beginners as they call them. They're oftentimes annoying and given too much space and time which they simply seem to misuse to irritate the viewer even more. While there are some interesting characters, you'll simply feel as if the anime would have been better either without them or with them having less screen time. \\n\r\nOther characters do have somewhat defined personalities, and are sometimes joy to watch (Crusty and princess come to mind), but even then they don't feel developed enough. Overall, though, given the number of characters with names, faces and personalities, I think they did a fine job representing them. \\n\\n\r\nI would lie if I said I didn't enjoy Log Horizon. Was it mind-blowing? No, not really. Was it this epic adventure you'll remember forever? Erm ... no. But it was a fun ride that lasted 25 episodes and I am looking forward to the sequel (mostly because I'm interested about one girl from Shirou's flashbacks. She seems fun). Battles were smart and weren't \"oh, I'm this massive dude and my powaaah is bigger than yours\" but instead they focused on teamwork of parties, which I found quite intriguing. The touch on politics and economics might put some viewers off but I personally enjoyed them and saw them as another layer of depth to an already established world. So yeah. Me like me some LH. (sorry Star Wars fans :() \\n\\n\r\nIf you do feel like SAO was lacking something or if you're simply looking for a decent anime, you can't go awry with Log Horizon. It isn't epic, it isn't mind blowing, it won't send you to places that will make you think about your life, but it will provide temporary enjoyment and it won't bore you to death. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: recommended.",

            "content": "At the peak of my disgust of all of RPG Anime things, here comes the Log horizon. Unfortunately not saving the day just making it a bit better but that suffices for now. Let me clear up some things first before I will get to the review itself.\r\nUsually RPG Anime genre which is at some point certainly very tempting but nonetheless vastly empty, except the fact that the story is happening in virtual environment nothing new nor awesome is going on by all means. Not mentioning all of the wasting of potential for fun-service which is understandable for the simple reason that most of Animeconsumers are MOE zombies and primal reason of existence of companies is revenue. At the end of the day we don't very often get a quality product.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started watching LH I almost quit, guess why? I had enough of \"This is not SAO\" shows. A week later when I cooled down a bit I gave it a second chance. Now I am really happy that I did so.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to evade comparison between SAO and LH. Actually I do not understand why everyone feels the need to compare these two Animes. The only common element here is that real people get stuck in an MMORPG, the result is different. Unfortunately two of them have been confronted so often, that I don't have a choice.\\n\\n\r\nThe show started quite slowly with what seemed like typical, hackneyed plot. But later things start to snowball. Problems are getting more serious and world begins to take on dimensions, both growing at a steady pace. The animation is very pleasing for the eye and the music aspect also has a lot of nice \"straight out of game\" like soundtracks. Action scenes seem to be rather lacking in this kind of genre however the in-show implemented game mechanics explanation is acting like compensation. The imbalance between dialogues {not as important ones} and the action is a con. LH is unfortunately Shounen so we can't evade Clich\u00e9 and fun service.\\n\r\nConstant rubbing of glasses by our smart-ass heroes was pissing me off. The main character, Shiroe, plays both the protagonist and antagonist role. He is behind everything, playing the game, always having some card in his sleeve {NGNL similarity}. Akatsuki aka. Lolininja is a wasted potential. Then we got a pervy guy Naotsugu and antipole gentleman catman Nyanta {WTF}. Even though this Anime certainly has some problems like slow acceleration from the start and cheesy humor the plot is really good and most importantly the RPG element is very well executed.\\n\\n\r\nThe authors of this elaborate work we're aware of the potential and did not make the same mistake as the SAO, which was mostly about {weakly executed} romance and nothing else. LH truly focuses on the breathing online world where the players are imprisoned, the impact of their actions and choices on the world, communication with the NPC, skills and abilities, magic system, events etc. Unlike in SAO. There is no sense of imminent threat. So whatever is happening its still just a game {little memory loss is nothing compared to death imo}\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show for all the SAO haters out there. Anyway, I am looking forward to the second series.",

            "content": "People trapped in a MMORPG sounds like something we've seen at times especially recently, we have one of the animes that more polarized as the community:Sword Art Online\r\nSAO is a similar premise, but still quite different in their implementation and development and it is not fair to compare one nor to the other.\r\nWhat makes it different, Log Horizon show some implication from the first chapter, which will be the tonic that makes the whole anime, and its they're stuck in the game, what they gonna do now?\r\nThat's what makes it different, the lack of an objective/specific goal that leads them to be more outstanding fightto survive, from this point that the narrative focuses on present problems of a society, such as abuse of power, disregard, power forces, commerce, social classes and even in some part the migration.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon complex issues is a pretty nice way, and that is the true subject of the picture, not a villain at first glance, human relations become a sort of villain with which our protagonists struggle, plus some moments that are involved in battles that represent fairly realistic as are the MMORPG\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well-drawn, all very good complete its mission within the anime including the one that most stands out is Shiroe strategist, which is one of the best protagonist in a while, in the course of the anime have seen a progress in the character to first costs interact with others to take the risk of being the head of a movement, he understands he has to put aside the passivity, and if you want to improve you have to take initiative, his nickname \"the villain with glasses\" is that as a strategist knows that there are sometimes you have to push a little more rules on the strings to achieve its mission, which goes beyond normal prototype of the perfect protagonists, which works and gives a perfect theme for anime touch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty well done and consistent, good fluidity and the few fight scenes are technically very good, the character design is pretty good too, in part sound also very acceptable nothing extraordinary but pairs well running scenes, what would be the opening database remarkable feat. Takuma ( 10 Feet ) executed by Man With a Mission.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon is a highly recommended for those who enjoy complex topics anime, the anime has a few action scenes or fights, contains elements of comedy that much lighten the atmosphere , in many chapters the protagonists are caught up in conversations so if 're not the type to enjoy that nearly 80 % of the chapter no action is not an anime for you, but you invite him to give it a try , it's really a good option to see and in October it has been revealed will have a second season.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Log Horizon follows in the same path as Sword Art Online in being focused on a popular MMORPG game where thousands of its players find themselves incapable of logging off the game under mysterious circumstances. Unlike SAO though, Log Horizon is a bit more light-hearted in its focus on how players handle their rather unique situation and the serious moments are not as heavy-handed, the latter being the major reason why I never got drawn into Sword Art Online. Mainly focused on enchanter Shiroe and the members of his party, our leads strive to restore stability and order to the game as many players areabuse their unique predicament for personal gain to enforce their will on weaker players, steal items and player-killing.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does a rather great job tackling the normal behavior of players participating in an MMORPG with novices, veterans and rule-breakers. This can involve anything from helping novice players, making friends, actively participating in game activity or actively abusing the unique circumstances of the game. Regular MMORPG activity such as special events, forming guilds, gaining game experience and getting rare items is seen and part of regular social activity within the series. Those that form parties even strategize to develop strategies to fend off enemy threats as they either compete against rogue parties or fend against enemy monsters. In addition, logging out of the game isn't the only bizarre thing affecting players and the gaming environment as other bizarre things pop up that get explored which affect how players deal with their present situation.\\n\\n\r\nGaming isn't the only element addressed within the series either as a good chunk of the anime's plot revolves around Shiroe and his comrades trying to make sense of their current situation in the game and restore order to it. The task isn't an easy one as players are wary of the current gaming environment thanks to guilds and parties reigning control over parts of the game and intimidating other players into joining their ranks or not to put up any resistance. Through extensive knowledge of the game and social interactions between others, Shiroe develops a number of plans throughout the series to deal with rogue guilds, rescuing novice players, dealing with hostilities and bringing some semblance of rules for players to follow that involve some bits of ruthlessness as he exploits unique abilities and game resources to drive off the corrupt elements affecting players within the game.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond Shiroe, we do get introduced to a number of other characters who have their personalities and mentalities explored as to why they participate in the game. While a number of them milk character types typical of MMORPG and rom-com titles, they are still a likeable bunch and the majority of characters get enough fleshing out where you can connect with them as they adjust to events that take place throughout the series. Only issues that come up with the series for me are hit-and-miss attempts at comedy coming from typical anime tropes mostly coming from Akatsuki's character in some form, a few rather shallow characters and the series still ongoing into its second season as the mystery surrounding the changes to the game still left unresolved.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Log Horizon was an engaging series for the most part as it struck a nice balance between typical MMORPG activity and its plot exploration with Shiroe trying to deal with their unique situation taking place in the gaming world and restoring order to it when chaos breaks out. Fans of MMORPG-based anime titles should give the series a look.",

            "content": "This anime is playing second fiddle to SAO in regards to viewership; but can hold its own through thought-out dialogue and a political intrigue filled plot line. \r\nStory & Character: \r\nThe story is carried through several strong characters; and a few side characters that over-shadow some of the leads. I especially did not enjoy Akatsuki the assassin-girl. It seems like she could have had a whole lot more depth to her but they didn't add it in. Shiroe is definitely one of the best male protagonists I've recently seen (much more interesting than Kazuto from SAO), and by the end Minori seems to almost takeover the female lead role from Akatsuki.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: Living in the Database, Database, whoa-o. That intro song is hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nOverall, I think that I will definitely be watching the 2nd season once it's completed. Is it \"better\" than SAO? I think it does a better job of fleshing out the game world they are stuck in than SAO, but does a poor job of explaining the real world situation outside the game, which is where SAO excels. I see no reason for someone not to watch both SAO and this to see which one they prefer, as they both have something to offer.\\n",

            "content": "Log Horizon is an adventure anime where our cast is among the people who have been trapped in an online game representation of Japan.\r\nThe story is somewhat multi-faceted. It starts with the characters simply trying to figure out the working of their new world into trying to manage it. There are other small arcs that interconnect these things together. At the start of the anime I was very impressed with how it really seemed like they were in a fully functional MMO with rules and teamwork. Almost everything in the anime somehow focuses on different aspects of what you would know from an MMO andhave interesting takes on how the changes would affect them.\\n\\n\r\nI was also impressed with how well they built the world. It has all the elements of an MMO and yet they don't neglect the fact that changes are being made within the world and take into account how these changes might affect the rules and characters within the game. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is reasonably large but it's really only fair to focus on a few characters, the main Shiro, is a decent male lead who essentially is the gateway for things to happen in the anime. While a lot of the cast is likeable an issue is that a lot of the main characters get almost no development, and this includes Shiro.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say there is no character developmet, it's there... but the side characters get it. Now, again, just about all of their growth is facilitated by Shiro, but I do find it odd that the main cast simply follows their archetype like Shiro is devious and Akatsuki is one of those shy type girls fully devoted to Shiro. While the side characters start to change their stripes and question more than their situation, they question themselves and their character.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a problem with Log Horizon beyond the weird development imbalance. Honestly, that's not even a huge issue. It's that it seems to dress up what should be a trivial problems and make them much larger than they actually are. The pacing of the show is also somewhat odd since they will often place little fun episodes in for no reason at all, not even fan-service, it's like they are just there. It's not even a filler episode since a lot of them somehow link to the next one, it just has a very different tone.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that there is a very distinct lack of action as the show begins to take the turn more into the affects of the change in the world versus the world being an MMO itself. Because of this there is a lot of dialogue without much payoff for conversations since everything is building to something else, and a lot of these are not yet realized.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is somewhat middling. Not bad mind you, but just not impressive. The OP is great and while the music does take some time to have its full affect in the show, it steps things up along the way. The sound in the anime is impressive.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon has some amazing world building and an enjoyable cast of characters but fails to capitalize on them beyond a surface level.",

            "content": "Log Horizon has really impressed me. It is a solid 9/10 and possesses a quiet intelligence and maturity that rivals other flashier shows.\r\nAny anime about being stuck in a computer game is inevitably compared to Sword Art Online. When Log Horizon made its d\u00e9but on the scene, the most common compliment was that it was \u2018more realistic\u2019 than SAO. This didn\u2019t strike me as necessarily a good thing. I don\u2019t want to watch a show just to get lectured on proper MMORPG mechanics. As it turned out, Log Horizon does get the mechanics of MMORPGs right, but what makes it truly great is so muchmore.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with SAO was that it was blatant wish-fulfilment. The main protagonist Kirito is a Gary Stu whose only flaw is being so damn good at the game that everyone else is envious of him. Along the way he acquires the trophy wife Asuna (just because a girl can use a sword and is given the label of \u2018strong\u2019 does not automatically make her more than a cardboard character) and other female members of his harem. By sheer deus ex machina he is carried along by the plot and saves the day. What makes it worse is that the series never really looks at characters beyond the individual that is Kirito. SAO is less about Sword Art Online, the game that they\u2019re stuck in, and more about Jesus Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nIn Log Horizon's later episodes, it is highly unlikely that even a third of the frames in the episode contain Shiroe, the main protagonist. Shiroe himself is no self-absorbed prick with delusions about the extent of his powers. Next to Kirito, Shiroe is like an adult, which only makes sense because Shiroe is also a graduate engineering student. Log Horizon is about the trapped gaming community and the political ability of an individual to influence the direction society takes. Shiroe\u2019s only goal, outlined simply, was to \u2018improve the mood\u2019 of Akihabara, and he did so by kickstarting the gaming economy through the creation of goods in demand. His meticulous plan to bring the other dominant powers to cooperate with him is not something that can be compared to some flashy sword swings on the part of Kirito. Next to Log Horizon, SAO is purely solipsistic.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon's cast is diverse, and one character in particular deserves mention. Minori is a young girl also trapped in the game, and spends most of the initial episodes basically performing child labour under the auspices of an exploitative guild. After being liberated by Shiroe, the story focuses on her growth as she eventually assumes roles of greater responsibility while facing ethical decisions. In this case, Shiroe ends up playing the role of a mentor and role-model, and it's fascinating to watch Minori through mimicking him, understand his motivations behind his actions. Of note is also Princess Lenessia, a self-described 'lazy and unmotivated' girl who ends up changing the fate of her country, and playing a key role in a powerful political alliance. It's generally hard to manage a cast of nearly twenty consistently appearing characters, but Log Horizon manages to make them absolutely endearing and sympathetic. More than anything, Log Horizon paints an optimistic and comedic picture of human cooperation while skilfully portraying an intriguing world with shadowy politicking in the backdrop.\\n\\n\r\nThe one flaw that Log Horizon has is its art and animation. The character designs and backdrops are a bit bland (though charming) at times. Especially because Log Horizon's focus was never on battles - battles being hardly conducive for creating anything constructive - it really isn't that bad not having top notch art. Season two will be airing this fall, and I'm definitely watching.",

            "content": "Where do I even start with this anime... First of all i am not the most well versed in anime but i do have a long history of playing MMORPG games like the game \"Elder Tale\" depicted in this anime and most of my issues with this are directed at the game deign because the anime is really just bland and not very good.\r\nTHE UI:\r\nImagine somebody watched a futureistic movie or something of the sort where holographic menus pop up that you control with your fingers.  Now imagine one where everything is the same bland green color and pops up randomly and moves allover the screen like mad.  Honestly an eyesore almost everytime it is animated and rather saddened me as a viewer.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CLASS/SKILL SYSTEM:\\n\r\nIn the show very few classes are shown to the viewer and even though most of the characters for each class are shown at the Max in game level (90) only like 2 or 3 skills are used by any of them at any given point.  However at one point there is another painful to look at menu for some body they are fighting skills and he has many more and refuses to do anything with them instead he just uses the same 3 cool downs.  Our MC has a CC spell that does 5x1k damage and binds a target and the main tank for him only has 13k hp meaning there is absolutely no balance in this game and all skills just should be ignored for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nTHE GUILD/FACTION/PVP:\\n\r\nWhat are the factions in this game you might be wondering?  FFA always 24/7 even in towns even on your own party members.  None of it makes any sense and should honestly just be ignored because it will hurt you too much as anybody who has played any MMORPG or like game before.  Not to mention that healers can heal people while they are dueling and all duels are literally to the death.  \\n\\n\r\nTHE PARTYS:\\n\r\nI really don't even want to talk about the party system in the show/LN/game because it makes me so mad.  A party in an actual MMORPG style game has these components\\n\r\nTANK | DEEPS (x2/x3) | HEALZ\\n\r\nThis game has\\n\r\nOPERATOR | FIELD MONITOR | PATROL FILE\\n\r\nI honestly cant even begin to start to describe my frustration watching the party play in this game/show whatever you want to call it.  If any single person in this show was in a party of mine in any game instant kick, instant guild removal, muted, banned from vent.  Honestly this is really more like LARP the show then a depiction of what an actual game is like and that made me feel physically ill.\\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY:\\n\r\nsucks, read more about what other people had to say I really did not care for it and at no point did it surprise me or have me empathizing with any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nMY CONCLUSION:\\n\r\nIf you have ever played a MMORPG do not watch this show you will hate yourself for it.  If you have ever LARP'd watch this show you will love it.  Approach with caution.  Do not expect intelligence.\\n",

            "content": "//In short:\r\n>To watch or not to watch?\r\nDefinitely, yes, but only if you don't have something gorgeous at \"plan to watch\".\r\n>For whom is it?\r\nFor ones who likes MMO thematic, fantasy genre and to watch for character's relationships and stories.\r\n> What its about?\r\nAbout nothing in general.There is no strict idea that slips throughout the whole story.\r\nWell, lets take a closer look.\r\n//Story.\r\nMain story begins when some huge number of players found themselves stuck at fiction world of MMO game after the lastest \"update\".And here come an association with Sword Art Online. But while SAO was all about surviving at and conquering a hostile world - Log Horizon tellinga story about living at another world.People really haven't tried to leave this place but tried to make it better for live.SAO its a story about a lone hero that shuts down a system, defeats two mad dragons and saves a princess \"from another castle\". And here is principal difference. In LH you will be told about advantage of team approach and cooperation.Main character and his mates will be trying to build and organize a new society that matches their views of justice.So you will see lots of politics and conversations, but quite few action scenes.Yes, this anime is not about fighting action(but there will be some epic moments).\\n\r\nIn general, LH reminds me LOTR or The Hobbit (especially while mc and his mates traveled to help Serara) as if there wouldn't be an evil lord to struggle against + lots of social layer and political mind games. This story (at least at first seaon)is not about a game itself or a virtual world - i think they just used this setting to attract spectator's attention.Because no questions like \"How exactly characters got into virtual reality?\", \"How its possible and in what kind of world they really got involved into?\" were answered.People just accepted this new reality and almost completely forgot about homeworld. \\n\r\nMaybe in second season something will change, maybe at original novel/manga something was different against anime adaptation, but in fact what i saw here it's a social fantasy-based story wrapped into MMO-game cover.\\n\\n\r\nHowever it was quite interesting to follow that story - during this show i've never caught myself on desire to stop watching or skip to next episode.Well, almost never.To be honest.\\n\\n\r\n//Art\\n\r\nTalking about visual performance - enjoyable.\\n\r\nNot a genius visual but it makes its work for me.\\n\\n\r\n//Sound\\n\r\nAt most of times its just no more than good, but in some episodes, especially while some action scenes occurs, sound has its quite impressive guitar instrumentals.\\n\\n\r\n//Characters.\\n\r\nThey are not deep designed and I'd wanted more backstory but what we already have is enough for storyline.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what we have here?\\n\\n\r\n1) Shiroe. Former cad engineer student (\"Building a sentry!\"), support class mage and local mastermind.Differed by intelligence and gumption.\\n\r\nOne of the most calm and reasonable character.But even in terms that he is a tactical genius in Elder Tale's world, in fact comparing to other \"everything-goes-as-planned\" anime heroes Shiroe looks faintly.But more realistic.\\n\\n\r\n2)Akatsuki. 90lv Assassin aka \"miss sudden appearance\". Playing a role of Shiroe's personal bodyguard.Someone may assume she just likes roleplay but we know the truth. \\n\r\nPretty cute girl also.Henrietta approves.\\n\r\nLike a true assassin should be - complete mystery.Who was she at real life - classified information.Except, she is not a loli in real life in fact.\\n\r\nI didn't remember anything else about her character's backstory...maybe because she is not talking too much about herself during storyline.Maybe because nobody cares :( \\n\r\nUnfortunately.\\n\\n\r\n!Pww, yellow spoiler alert!\\n\r\nWell, and talking about Shiroe and Akatsuki relations, i personally can't understand how this guy can be so smart and so blunt at the same time.Maybe he just so involved into global business(btw, he really is) or believes that her straight allusions are just part of roleplay, but... its too silly for this kind of character like Shiroe i think.Such things makes me sad. However, lady suffers all season long.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNext two are formally main characters and best friends of Shiroe, but i think they have more supportive roles because of low influence on storyline and and even less designed compared to first two.\\n\\n\r\n3)Naotsugu.\\n\r\nTank class warrior.Wears heavy armor.Absorbs damage.Friends with Shiroe.Pervert.Sometimes he tries to joke and...absorbs damage.\\n\\n\r\n4)Nyanta. \\n\r\nKawai cat being.\\n\r\nGentleman person with double rapiers.Serara approves.\\n\r\nA chef of God and just a nice guy who maintains a friendly atmosphere at Log Horizon.\\n\\n\r\n//Conclusion.\\n\r\nWell, i think the main flaw of this anime is that it just good one. Not bad and not perfect.This one didn't leave me with bright (or dark and philosophical)impressions after watching but it was interesting experience.",

            "content": "\u201cHard to believe it all started with a hamburger that has some flavour.\u201d\r\nLog Horizon is a surprise package, it began airing not long after the immensely popular Sword Art Online ended, and shares the same concept: players are trapped in a MMORPG and unable to get out, also its animation isn\u2019t as flashy as SAO, causing some may cast their doubts onto Log Horizon, I was one of those viewers.\r\nHowever, things actually turned out rather well here.\r\nSTORY: 8/10 \r\nThe story of Log Horizon can be summarized by 3 words: simple, straightforward, sweet. Its plot follows a very clear path and it is not difficult tounderstand what they are trying to convey, and the dialogue is sufficiently added to provide enough explanation for the viewers. I like how Log Horizon gives us a decent insight on how does the MMORPG \u201cElder Tale\u201d works, from the job system, currency, guild system and many more, so at least you are familiar with the setting and then it will be easier to understand the motive of the characters\u2019 actions.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Log Horizon progresses through different arcs, which sort of come off as the different stages of new challenges our protagonists have to go through, although timeskips still occur here, it is merely a tool used to tell a story lasting throughout several years. \\n\\n\r\nPolitics are actually an important plot point here, so as you can see things can go really far from here. \\n\\n\r\nIt may be argued that most of the trapped players seen in the anime don\u2019t seem to be so urgently wanting home, but it may be explained as simply they do not know the way, and had grown accustomed to the new world they had no choice but to adapt and inhabit. \\n\\n\r\nART: 7/10 \\n\r\nThe animation of Log Horizon is one that doesn\u2019t stand out and impress you, causing you to run and catch your dropped jaw rolling all over the floor. However, it is decent enough to be pleasant to the eyes, and the battles showcased are decent. Each character is distinctive from each other, and changes their attire (equipment) to suit their needs. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\r\nNothing too impressive as well in this department, you have background music which always accompany the scenes, but they are hardly memorable. You will hear the same battle track several times as you progress through this anime. The characters voices aren\u2019t that superb either. I actually liked the catchy OP, Database~ Database~ \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7/10\\n\r\nLog Horizon generally splits their protagonists to 2 groups, Shiroe and the Tea Party gang forms some of the highest level and the strongest members of the show, they are the ones to solve the mysteries of this entrapment and to further explore the world. Minori and her party of lower level characters form the \u201cnewbie\u201d characters, who are still learning the basics of the game and showed us more about getting stronger in this world. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with Log Horizon is that we are not given much background regarding our main characters, they are strong just because they are the veterans in the game. We do not know why Akatsuki is so attached to Shiroe, other than he gave her an appearance-changing potion at the start of the series, so sometimes you just have to accept that the characters are what they are shown to you and nothing more. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, all is not unwell here as despite the large cast of characters, each of them are still explored sufficiently, each of them have important roles they have to fulfill, and by the end of the day you will know and remember all or most of them, which is a fine job done by the developers.    \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10\\n\r\nLog Horizon isn\u2019t an anime that will make you utterly depressed and devastated, or will confuse you with its huge collection of jargon words, instead it is a simple and straightforward anime which one can have fun easily. Dialogue may be abundant sometimes but the pacing is fast enough to ensure you won\u2019t get bored too much. If you like gaming, this is definitely a decent anime for you. \\n",

So here I am, still waiting for a party because I decided to be a total moron and be a DPS, writing a review for this show.\r\nLog Horizon is the most accurate portrayal of an MMO I've seen in any form of media. You have some high level raiding groupthat just spends all day PvE'ing, you have some camping PvPers that can't do shit because anyone with better gear (crafters and raiders) just shits on them, the RPers who just seem to think MMOs are like The Sims or OKCupid, and you have the most common type of player; the kind that just sits around making stuff to sell for money so they can buy materials to make better stuff. The show's plot is a great example of how MMOs play, people do something tedious, whether it be fighting, gathering, or crafting, until they reach their goal, and then they fight, gather, and craft with shinier toys and the cycle repeats itself. Normally, I'd criticize a show's plot for being repetitive but Log Horizon really is an accurate representation of MMOs, people doing very repetitive actions while nothing different happens until an in-game event starts.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is watchable, but definitely not the quality of some of the more hyped anime. It just looks sort of odd and low quality in comparison to other shows. It definitely reminded of Welcome to the NHK though, probably because it was produced by the same company, but I would think it would look more like the novel illustrations, not an artstyle shared by the animators. Unless the novel illustrations just looked really similar to NHK's, then that's just a pretty neat coincidence.\\n\\n\r\nLike any other anime (or MMO), the soundtrack for this show wasn't really memorable, except for the ending, I thought the ED theme was pretty good. Don't know why they chose to focus on a side character for it, but its not like many people watch it every episode so it doesn't really matter now does it? Personally, I think it would've been funny, but annoying, if they played BGM 24/7 like how MMOs do but I'm sure they would've lost a lot of viewers if they actually tried that shit.\\n\\n\r\nAll I have to say is, I liked the characters. They were rather diverse and seemed consistent throughout the show. Shiroe was being portrayed the exact opposite as Kirito was in SAO. While Kirito was portrayed as a hero but acted like an edgy douche, Shiroe was portrayed as an anti-hero but acted as the show's main hero, making all the right decisions. The only thing I wasn't too sure about was NPCs being personified, it just felt like, \"I'm an NPC, pay attention to me, I matter\"! Ninja loli was a qt.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon isn't for everybody, but if you're used to the monotonous gameplay that all MMOs seem to share, you'll probably like this show a lot. If you've never played an MMO before, open up Excel and hold the Page Down key. If you have fun watching the row numbers increase, you'll probably like this show and MMOs too.",

            "content": "Log Horizon is about players being trapped inside an MMORPG called 'Elder Tale\". Though the reason for being trapped is not explained and the concept isn't all that original, however this anime is a very interesting watch and has many twists that keep it interesting. \r\nThere will definitely be people who compare this anime to Sword Art Online, which in no doubt is fairly obvious with the \"trapped in game\" setting. But rest assured my fellow watchers! This anime is definitely a work of its own (Which I'm sure SAO haters will be glad to know) and worth the watch.\r\nStory-7\r\nThe story is what I feelis one of the average aspects of the anime. Nothing too amazing happens and the concept like I stated earlier isn't very original. However there was something that made Log Horizon different and I found this to be a strong point. Firstly, the \"being trapped in a game\" deal isn't really played out as a massive issue in this series. If anything, this feels like one of those things that really wouldn't make that huge of a difference if they weren't trapped in the first place. This is because the factor of \"if you die in the game, you die in real life\" isn't a part in this series, though there are consequences to death in-game which I wont speak of (for spoilers sake). Also, the characters thrive to improve the world straight from the first adventure they embark upon. However you should note that this anime isn't that huge on battle scenes. If anything, it's mostly strategy and well thought out battles which are kept interesting with the master mind of the series tactics, Shiroe. Though battle scenes DO happen, they're nothing to gawk over. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\\n\r\nI feel this is what interested me the most. The main character that you follow for a majority of the series, Shiroe, plays both the protagonist who controls his community from the shadows and all his guild mates look up to him, while also playing a semi antagonist role where the city fears him as the \"Villain in Glasses\" who's always scheming. He also plays a large role in all the big changes through out the world of \"Elder tale\" which I will refrain from explaining to prevent spoilers. Shiroe is also very quick witted and always has a trick up his sleeve when it comes to battles, but he isn't your typical \"broken protagonist\" (cough-Kirito-cough) that can just huehuehue his way through everything, simply because he's the main character. Instead, every problem he solves is through a newly discovered method that he made with his friends, or his own ideas. I feel this would make him a formidable adversary in any situation and someone you would definitely want on your side. The other main characters also play significant roles too, hence them being main characters (I feel like I derped a bit there). \\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki, the Loli ninja of the series who follows Shiroe as she feels that she is indebted to him, to me, plays the role of a mascot towards the end of the series. This is a shame because at the start of the series, she's a bawse that wrecks noobs in a fitting way that suits her role as an assassin. However towards the second half of the series, she just plays the role of Henrietta's stress relief. \"KYAA~ KAWAII\" is enough to summarize her existence in the last half of Log Horizon in my opinion which makes me sad. So much potential waste.\\n\\n\r\nNaotsugu could be considered the comedy relief at the start of the series. He's always making jokes about seeing panties and getting the rough end of Akatsuki's kicks to the face. He also used to play Elder Tale with Shiroe before they were trapped inside the game. He doesn't really play a huge role apart from taking menial tasks for Shiroe.\\n\\n\r\nNyanta. He's a cat man. He doesn't get introduced right from the first episode, but from my perspective, he played the father figure for Shiroe in some situations. He helps point people in the right direction when it comes to making decisions and is always giving advice. All while looking like a classy cat man and maintaining his nyaa~tastic speech pattern.\\n\\n\r\nArt-6\\n\\n\r\nI didn't find anything particularly good or bad about the art. It's fairly average but it's nothing to claw your eyes out over.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\\n\r\nNow this is something that I loved. The soundtrack made the battles that extra touch better. Personally I loved the Opening theme and the Ending theme. Mainly the ending theme since it was always tuned in at the right times and ended the episodes appropriately. I didn't see anything wrong with the voice actors. Shiroe's seiyuu fit his role the best in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8\\n\\n\r\nI found this really enjoyable right from the beginning. There were definitely a few great twists that kept the story interesting. I liked this anime even more since I proved myself wrong that it wasn't a SAO rip-off like I thought it would be.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely watch this series since it just finished airing. There will also be a second season in October this year too. Something I'm definitely looking forward to.\\n\\n",

            "content": "ok, first order of business: do NOT watch the dub because it makes Nyanta (cat man) sound like even more of a seductive pedophile. \r\nok, fine I'll be honest i was kinda into it too.\r\nI'm going to start with the bad. What killed this anime for me was the FILLER EPISODES (trust me, so far the second season is three times as bad). The main plot was REALLY engaging, but in many cases, it barely moved. There was tons of distracting and petty shit that got in the way. FOR EXAMPLE: romantic development was annoying and disappointing. also, the whole food thing. WHY? also, NOBODYCARES ABOUT THE JUNIOR MEMBERS OF LOG HORIZON. at all. idk there were multiple episodes where there was no pressing matter or nothing was really at stake.\\n\\n\r\nBut really, the only reason LH let me down so much, is because it got my expectations way up. For good reasons too.\\n\\n\r\nWhile LH is often not as visually enticing as other anime in the video game genre, it instead focuses on developing the society and world. LH is an anime of opposing factions, politics, power struggles, and social ethics. Almost all of the plot is derived from how the game world is changing since it became reality. As a result, the character development is rather good, while still maintaining at least an illusion of subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this focus, LH takes a step back from action. However, part of me (the gamer part) would have liked to see them actually go out and explore the new DLC and get more powerful. While character development is important, the whole point of the setting being in a video game is so the characters can develop as players. I would have liked to see them gain new items or more abilities or progress their builds in some way. But that's just me. I WANT MORE MONSTERS AND I WANT MORE SHINY SWORDS.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things LH did right was the main character: Shiroe. He is not the bland, all-powerful, game breaker such as Kirito from SAO. But he is also not the sniveling, pathetic, unwatchable Haru of Accel World. He plays as a supportive battle strategist who has a place in the world like anyone else. It is his own intuition and discoveries that make him special. This allows the anime to revolve around cunning and plot. As a result, the power struggles can be on a larger, more sophisticated scale.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say it was a fun watch. Yes, disappointing in some ways, but refreshing in others.\\n",

            "content": "Log Horizon may be your ordinary action-adventure-fantasy series but it is not necessarily to say that it has nothing more to offer than temporary entertainment for it may as well captivate your heart with its light atmosphere, exciting and thrilling adventures. As it may have minor flaws, these didn\u2019t stop it from standing out among its genre-related competitors such as Sword Art Online, Overlord, or even DanMachi.\r\nCutting through the background and synopsis...\r\n               Storywise, the plot iscohesive enough and relatively easy to follow through without it being predictable and boring. The initial flow of the story was rather slow for its genre, adventure, as it focused more on setting the foundation (you may not find yourself fired up during these parts). There are times it gets carried away to the point that a few episodes become non-essential or even uninteresting \u2013 with regards to the plot. \\n\\n\r\n               Nevertheless, the story is quite consistent in delivery throughout and it shares some good plot twists from time to time, not to mention those crucial episodes. Not forget, the show has a good balance of comedy, action, a little drama\u2026 and romance so you won\u2019t be getting tired of the similar content.\\n\\n\r\n               The series presented a lot of characters, however, the purpose of presenting a lot of personalities is to keep things interesting by capturing and holding the attention of the audience in hopes that they find one of their liking and Log Horizon didn\u2019t do too well on that challenge. As the story progresses, a majority of the characters didn\u2019t show enough character development through overcoming internal and external challenges thus not establishing a deep connection with the audience \u2013 think of Edward Elric or Alibaba Saluja. \\n\\n\r\n               Taking the main character as an example: Shiroe (voiced by Terashima, Takuma) is not your casual gamer who was coincidentally trapped in the virtual game by luck instead is an active and skilled player most likely to be there. As expected, Shiroe would not be having difficulties in playing, or living, through the game as he is experienced but considering the idea that being trapped in a virtual world despite the first main problem in the story being the life inside the game with danger being real \u2013 not only from the monsters but even fellow players. Even though the main protagonist didn\u2019t share his troubles, he did portray leadership and camaraderie. \\n\\n\r\n               Speaking of, the connections between characters were established very well, most specially in terms of good relations making it possible for the anime to create a convincing light atmosphere which is the main reason I like it and the same reason I find it to stand out. \\n\\n\r\n               I enjoyed watching the show particularly the silly moments, suspenseful reveals, surprisingly good tactics/strategies, music and most of all, character relationships and interactions.\\n\\n\r\n               So if you are a huge fan of adventure, be sure not to miss out on Log Horizon and in case you are worried that it might turn out to be generic for your taste, Log Horizon has its own flavor added to the genre \u2013 it\u2019s one of those journeys you won\u2019t be likely forget.\\n",

The anime starts a bit slow and the first season wasn't my favorite, the players don't show any type of interest in exploring the world and most of it its just politics but the second seasonreally really stood out to me and it became one of my favorite animes.

            "content": "Having just watched half of SAO s1 and thrown it down in raging disgust, I came across Log Horizon and ignored it at first due to its extremely similar synopsis. I finally came back and watched it after seeing some decent reviews. Now that I've seen it, I would like to proclaim Log Horizon to be the salvation of the gaming anime genre!\r\nArt and sound are decent and consistent but the characters and setting of Log Horizon are what makes this series truly amazing.\r\nThis series has a diverse cast of utterly lovable characters. Even the supporting characters or the mains who occasionally get sidelined arestill fun to watch due to their interactions with each other. The huge cast should be no surprise as this is a Massive Multiplayer Online game. Unlike SAO, LH fleshes out many of its characters, bringing them to life and shows the community among the players within the game world.  This is how a fun MMO should be, and LH portrays it perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is also rather intriguing. Rather than just being a prison that players have to escape from, the game world becomes their reality according to the MC, Shiroe. The game is a living breathing world that can be shaped by whatever actions the players take, and a lot of the story develops as a result of the players discovering new possibilities and events that happen over the course of the series. Due to its heavy emphasis on world building with economies and governments being established within the game world, this series tends to be dialog heavy and may not be a favorite among action fans. The action is certainly there but not in nearly every episode.\\n\\n\r\nOne gripe I had with the series was how no one seemed to care about being stuck in the game. Maybe literally everyone in LH are gaming nerds with no friends irl and are perfectly fine being stuck in a game with their online friends, but I doubt it. There is also no explanation as to how everyone became trapped. Some kind of unexplainable spontaneous magical anomaly? Oh well, not going to debate anime logic. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its lack of explanations, LH's well-paced story and immersive world makes it a must watch. Watch now and see the truth, thy heathens !",

            "content": "Log Horizon suffers from the problem of being mediocre because of poor writing. Poor for a number of reasons: 1.) It has so many possible elements to explore but capitalizes on none of them because it started off so poorly. 2.) Its lazy in that it leaves the reader to assume much while it explains little. Most other issue I have with it fall under these two reasons.\r\nThe show is set in the virtual game world of Elder Tale where our cast is trapped in with no known way of escape. And it\u2019s not just them apparently; there are many people from the real worldwho are all trapped in this game for an unknown reason (they are referred to throughout the series as \u201cThe Adventurers\u201d in contrast to the NPC\u2019s who are referred to as \u201cThe People of the Land\u201d).  You\u2019d think that that would be explored more in the series, guess again. Rather than showing even the slightest care as to how or why they are trapped inside virtual reality, they start wandering around getting more involved in the surroundings and politics of the virtual community more than anything else. This brings me to ask, \u201cWhy even bother using the whole \u2018trapped in a virtual reality\u2019 setting if you aren\u2019t even going to explore the reasons behind why you\u2019re trapped?\u201d Needless to say, this is a big slap in the face as the show continues ignoring that issue even to the end of the season. At best it comes off as, \u201cOh, that\u2019s being handled off-screen, don\u2019t worry.\u201d That annoys me because I wonder if it\u2019s just being used as bait to keep people who care about plot on board. I think under a different setting the show would\u2019ve had a better chance at success. Rather than a being trapped in a virtual setting I think it would\u2019ve worked better as a real fantasy setting.  \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, the whole ignoring a big problem like that from the get-go really lost points in my book.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, so apart from ignoring an apparent problem without any justification as to why, what else makes this show mediocre? Well, the characters. Because none of the characters throughout the show give a damn about being trapped in a game, it\u2019s hard to take any of them seriously. It makes them shallow and gives little room for uniqueness among them since they all seem to share this common lack of interest in escaping virtual reality, or why they\u2019re even there in the first place. \\n\r\nBecause they\u2019re shallow, a lot of their interactions between them feel empty and meaningless, nothing more than a convenience to drive (or force) the plot forward. But wait! The plot isn\u2019t being driven forward! Instead the focus is more on dealing with episodic content and small-arcs involving The Adventurer\u2019s relations with the People of the Land and themselves. Which raises another question in the viewer\u2019s mind: \u201cWhy care about the NPC\u2019s?\u201d This same question is asked of the MC by a mysterious character that appears at the end of the season. No response is given to it, instead it\u2019s ignored and we\u2019re left with a cliff-hanger episode that raises more questions than answers to bait us in for a second season (as if we needed any more bait considering you haven\u2019t made any significant advancement toward the plot).\\n\\n\r\nOk, on to the characters. There is no real character development throughout the series, everyone is just put into character molds without any justification as to why they are the way they are, and you just have to accept it. You are given very brief explanations about each character (mostly to do with their status in the virtual world and a little about their real selves) and that is all, sometimes you don\u2019t even get that. Also, their development throughout the show is little to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the MC; Shiroe. He is referred to in-series as the \u201cvillain in glasses\u201d. He is not exactly evil; his peers just don\u2019t know how to categorize his methods. A lot of his actions come off as inconsiderate or rude in the eyes of those that don\u2019t know him well, and they are to a degree, but we\u2019re supposed to be aware that he does these things to protect people he cares for. This point is not actually made clear until near the end of the season where Minori (a young girl whom Shiroe took under his wing to train in the art of strategy) has a chat with Shiroe about why he does certain things the way he does. I\u2019d compare his character to Hikigaya Hachiman, from Oregairu, but lacking the elaborate character-building of Oregairu.\\n\r\nHe\u2019s meant to play the cast\u2019s logically brilliant asocial introvert and yet he doesn\u2019t seem to care about the fact that he and many other people are trapped in a virtual world. He seems more focused on solving immediate problems like food, government and societal issues which are all game-related and have little consequence. Forget that you actually exist outside this game and that your body could potentially be starving from a lack of nutrients, forget all of that and just focus on game-related stuff that pales in comparison to actual life itself. This just doesn't fit with the characterization he\u2019s meant to portray. At least give me a reason as to why you don\u2019t care so much about your actual self which is outside of this virtual reality! \\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki is pretty much the loyal, unquestioning sidekick to Shiroe. She carries out his orders and is protective of him all because he gave her some potion in the beginning of the show that allowed her to play a character that matched her real-life appearance (since she originally played a male character). There seems to be some chemistry between them but because of the shallowness of the characters it comes off as meaningless. It isn\u2019t until near the end of the season that Akatsuki\u2019s feelings for Shiroe become clearer, however they\u2019re never really addressed by him and we have no insight as to why. \\n\\n\r\nNaotsugu is one of Shiroe\u2019s friends from the real world. He\u2019s more of a comic relief character with his openness about being a pervert, which leads to some comical moments between him and Akatsuki. There seems to be some chemistry going on with him and another side character, but again, it\u2019s all very superficial. \\n\\n\r\nNyanta is pretty much the gentle badass of the show. Gentle in that he\u2019s a gentleman and badass in that he dispatches his foes with relative grace and ease. We know even less about him than we do about the others in the main cast. \\n\\n\r\nThere is plenty more cast to go on about but a lot of them are pretty much filler with even less (or shallower) characterization than the main cast. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn summation, the ideas that Log Horizon explored were great ideas but they were severely overshadowed by a major plot hole that also serves as the story\u2019s starting point. This show could\u2019ve worked as episodic content with light plot under a different setting. It seems the writer cares little about world-building and character-building, and cares more about appearing serious by dealing with little dilemmas that arise throughout the series.  The ending of the first season pretty much left off where it started from with intrigue about escaping Elder Tales. However, it seemed more focused on a vague new problem that arises within the virtual world. I can only hope that the second season makes an effort at development instead of continuing episodic suspension of disbelief, although i've heard the 2nd season is no better in this department than the first.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re ok with watching a show that wants to be serious but totally ignores serious questions along the way, then you may be able to stomach this anime. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\\n",

            "content": "I myself am an Anime Fan and Video Gamer, and I find it really astonishing that Anime is being created in the video game setting, most popular of which being MMOs. Some are good, some are bad, some are really ugly. But one thing that completely stands out in all of them, is that the Video Game aspect is often distracted or dragged out of sight by.... plots (or at least trying to have one) and failing to completely immersing the viewer into the video game aspect as a good video game, like The Elder Scrolls, or the original Bioshock would otherwise excel in. EnterLog Horizon! A show that completely immerses you into the video game while telling a good story, with a wide cast of amazing characters to boot! This show is in fact so brilliant that it has invented it's own genre called \"Not Fucking Sword Art Online\" (seriously stop comparing this to Sword Art Online.)\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nLog Horizon is straight to the point, unlike SAO. The characters, along with countless other players in Log Horizon, are right off the bat mysteriously transported into the video game, Elder's Tale, as part of the new expansion for the game, with no way out in sight. Rather than being such in a virtual reality, the video game and reality have become synonymous. The players of Elder's Tale quite literally become their avatars, and anything that they can do in real life, they can do in the video game, and vise/versa. Any skills that the in game avatars developed in Elder's Tale, the characters could now do it naturally as if they've done it their entire lives. If their in game avatars could play the guitar, they could! If their characters could walk on water, they could! If their in game character could shoot a laser beam from their face, they could. As time passes in the world of Elder's Tale, the players are stuck with nothing to do, as traversing through the vast landscape that is a 1/4 scale (i might be wrong on this one) of the entire world is damn near impossible, living day to day life costs as much as killing three goblins, the sentiment of PEOPLE DIE IF THEY ARE KILLED is completely absent, and players have pretty much done everything that there was to do in Elder's Tale. Without spoiling way too much, after the first 4 or 5 episode arc, much of the season is spent creating a civilized way of life, maintaining order, and creating a sense of purpose in the MMO. Rather than finding a way out (which no sane video gamer would want to do) the main characters try to make the most of the time they have in the MMO world. I would describe the format of Log Horizon to be much like a Shonnen anime, with multiple arcs that tie with the bigger of the show as a whole. My hope is that because it is a Shonnen anime, i hope that it ends before the show destroys itself over the massive weight of it's already established potential. S1 already done, and S2's nearly over and no real end for Log Horizon is in site.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly the best aspect of Log Horizon are it's massive cast of characters. Many shows have a huge cast of characters, but what Log Horizon get's right is giving each of the characters enough screen time to not only feel relevant, but also have importance. The show does a good job of getting into the characters personalities and personal struggles, and follows how they adapt into the new world that they are living in. Specifically the most important character of the bunch is Shiroe. In any other anime, he would solve his problems by completely owning everybody with super duper Deus Machina Spells and blasting everyone into oblivion. In Log Horizon, much of the problem solving is through plotting, scheming, and strategising. Learning the opponents every move, reading his thoughts, and predicting the next attack, consistantly thinking ten seconds ahead of his opponents whether it be in the battlefield, or in political crusades. He works to build harmony between the Adventurers and the NPC characters, but by doing so in the shadows he get's the title of Villian In Glasses. He has many anti-heroic characteristics, but doing so gives him strong presence in the show's despite not having strong on-screen presence most of the time. While he is seemingly not involved through most of the show, he stays consistent throughout and helps develop the rest of the show's cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe Melancholy Of Watching Anime. Everything Wrong With..... Log Horizon \\n\\n\r\nAs much as i absolutely love this show and have been gushing over it since i started watching it, the problem is that it is not for everybody. Much like Ghost In The Shell, by needing an understanding of Science, Philosiphy, Politics, and the intelligence greater than that of a chipmunk, this show requires some of that and an acute understanding of Video Games and Video Game Mechanics, predominately MMORPGs. This is also a very much a talk/speech type anime like death note, and most of the run time is spent following people sitting in a circle, plotting and scheming. I can't help thinking that jaded anime fans would get incredibly bored of this type of plot progression and drop it very quickly. Speaking of Plot Progression.... Every single episode of Log Horizon is incredibly dense, and spends equal amounts of it's time in the aspect of developing characters, the world of elder's tale, strategising, and moving the plot forward. Because Log Horizon is focusing on so many things at once, Plot Progression does suffer, with four episodes of Log Horizon amounting to one of other anime as far as plot progression goes. This anime also has a humor element but that is a problem in itself. So much time is spent writing everything else, not much of it was spent writing the a variety of jokes for it. I do find myself laughing every single time to these (because I'm a child) but every single ounce of humor in this show involves Hennrietta playing dress-up with Akatsuki, and Naotsugu getting his ass kicked by Akatsuki before he says something totally perverted.... and not much else. Some people might now find a problem with any of these, which i for one don't, but they are worth mentioning. What it really boils down to is personal preference. \\n\\n\r\nWith any good show, i always suggest to anyone to go into a tv show as blind as possible, and with a set ground rule of expectations from said show, and watch a few episodes before deciding to spend more time with the one life you have on this earth on the show. I suggest you do the same with Log Horizon.... Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, and my eyes see Log Horizon as bloody brilliant!\\n\\n\r\nTENOUTATEN\\n\\n",

            "content": "Log Horizon is finally finished, and I like like many people can't wait for the second season to air. It was possible the most enjoyably show this season, but it isn't everyone \"cup of tea\". Unfortunately, the way it sets it sets up is open to much discussion. The thing is , you cannot compare this to SAO or Accel World in terms of action, as it is not a main key element. What you can compare is the way it is executed and the way it represents people being trapped in an MMO.\r\nFor example, SAO was not a bad show. It had a greatpremise, wonderful music, beautiful art, but really lacked in it's execution. It started of as a bomb shell, but ended on a rather mediocre ending.\\n\\n\r\nSAO was more focused on action and romance, being it's main genre's (Action and Romance), and was not afraid to break the reality barrier quite a few times. This lead to hordes of people praising or criticizing it, with several people left in-between, in a limbo of sorts. Log Horizon on the other hand, takes an opposite route. Yes there is action, but it focuses a lot more on character interactions, social aspects and political themes, building a society. This may at certain cases, lead several episodes to seem slow, but that's all part of the series, and in my opinion, pacing was done really well.\\n\\n\r\nThis unfortunately leads to people either liking it for it's new take on MMO (a much better one in my opinion) or disliking it due to lack of action, and for some people who view it as a very slow placed show. But his is about why I enjoyed it, not what others think.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe story for Log Horizon starts off slow, and for several episodes it may be hard to discern what exactly the plot is. The thing is, it's varied. It's not all \"hack and slash\". It is a well thought out plot and focuses on the aspects of society. Here is where it really shines. It follows logic. If you are trapped in an MMO, panic would ensure. How do you stop that panic? How do you keep the people sane, how do prevent chaos.\\n\\n\r\nThis ultimately lead sit to cause the viewer to focus more on the events happening. It makes you think: \"What really would happened if such an event took place?\". It causing you to think, and actually imagine yourself in such a situation. If your in it for a \"slash-a-thon\", you'll be disappointed. Their is action from time to time to keep you interested, but it is ultimately not it's focus.\\n\\n\r\nOn other thing I must praise the story for is it's ending. It doesn't leave you on a cliff-hanger. Yes, it dose keep you yearning for the second season to start soon, but it dose not end in a climatic situation, say in the middle of a fight.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound - (8, 8)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks were pretty decent, nothing amazing though. As for the art, it isn't spectacular, but it isn't lackluster either. One thing I like though is that more or less, it kept the same level of detail and fluid animation throughout the entire series. Although it is an NHK show, and from what I understand, they usually don't have too much of a large budget.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - (10)\\n\\n\r\nHere is where it shines the most. The wide variety of charterer is not only diverse, but highly likable. Shiroe, the main protagonist, isn't some OP kid, he is a strategist, and prefers to take the back seat, and command from the shadows. He's even nickname the \"Villain in the Glasses\". If you wanted a picturesque version of a person following the \"the results justify the means\", the Shiroe is a perfect example.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I must praise the character design for is how they actually look like they are in an MMO. The are not \"photogenic teenagers\" running rampart in a virtual world. They are level-headed, and actually think things though. There no power of friendship, no mysterious power suddenly gained, no OP skill revealed. Every action the characters take to solve problems is logical. It makes sense, it has a basis. It isn't coming out of no-where. They show's directors don't pull rabbits out of hat\". It's not a \"in your face\" kind of life. It all makes sense, something SAO kind of failed at. The creation of a new skill for example, while seeming world changing, if you actually look at the way it works, it makes sense. Manipulation of the world to your advantage has a basis, it makes sense. That is one of the best things about Log Horizon.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI loved this show. It was an awesome watch, and I would gladly jump through time so I can start watching the second season. I would advise anyone to watch this show. It a great watch, and It'll keep you entertained. Though if your looking for a mostly action based anime, you may or may not like it. None the less, give it a go, and you might just be surprised.",

            "content": "Many will compare this series to Sword Art Online. Mainly due to the fact both are set in the setting of an MMORPG trapping people within the game. While this comparison has some fair ground, I would venture to say that these two series look to achieve very different things and end up really pulling away from each other pretty quickly. Log Horizon is very much an individual series that is unique and offers a good story, quality characters, and an  enjoyable ride alongside the adventures of Elder Tale. \r\nProbably the most lacking of the qualities the show had was in the sound. Noteven in the very specific things like voice acting and sound effects, but in the broad spectrum it didn't do anything outstanding. I found the intro sequence to be particularly out of place. As well, the tracks played for setting purposes were bland. While definitely used appropriately, they could have gone that next step to add immerse us further into the world. The few times i felt immersed were in highlighted songs that bards (a class in the game) would play or when battles would occur. I also found myself humming the end sequence song quite often even though i didn't find it all that impressive (it is pretty catchy though). \\n\\n\r\nThe real quality of the show comes from the story, characters, and art. The easiest of these to see is the art. Every city, every dungeon, every player; everything has a good amount of detail. I was delighted to see the world come to life and how it showed me new areas and beautiful scenery. Simply put, Your eyes are in for a treat. \\n\\n\r\nThe story centers around our hero Shiroe as he becomes trapped in the game \"Elder Tale\". He is also a very well known player, earning it through some of the seemingly impossible quests he has accomplished as well as being a strategist. For Shiroe, his growth as a character is in his relationships with guilds in Akihabara (the main city for the series). We see him grow from being the strong, solo player to being a leader amongst the adventurers. But he doesn't grow just in title, but also in his ideals. He stands up for those who don't have a big enough voice. He stands up for ethics and morality. But in the end, he stands up for those he cares most for, to protect and serve them. Thankfully, Shiroe is not the only one who grows. A few particular characters (akatsuki, Minori, etc...) are shown to have similar development. Some realize their role has changed from before and accept that while others grow to become reliable, strong members along side Shiroe. The show does a great  job showing the growth of the characters in multiple ways and directions. It could be worth a watch just for that, but it doesn't stop there. The Plot of the series expands on the world of an MMORPG. Politics surrounding the guilds, world events, and even NPCs become plot points. The writers use the whole world of Elder Tale to their advantage (or at the the Japanese region). At times, the story does risk having the \"invincibility\" factor for the main group of characters and yet it never crosses that line. the characters remain unsure of some of their decisions and fight hard battles is the events. I never truly got the feeling that they were invincible, but i never once thought that they would be beaten easily. It would take a villain and a half to bring them down. \\n\\n\r\nMy hope is that the second season brings along with it this villain that pushes these characters to their limits. That the conflict only rises to an all time high and the characters themselves grow deeper. I especially want to see how the love sub-plot ends up, but i hope it remains as a nice side item that doesn't conflict with the main plot. \\n\\n\r\nI see no reason not to at least give this series the decency of watching the first few episodes. The show picks up a tad bit faster than most and rewards the viewers who stick with it to the end. I very much enjoyed my time watching it and hope you all will too!",

            "content": "The anime bases on three principle characters, Shiroe, Naotsugu, and Akatsuki, who are among in the ballpark of 30,000 players in Japan \u2013 and a few hundred thousand around the world \u2013 caught in the realm of 'Elder Tale', a long-running MMORPG that, for some unexplained reason, has caught everybody inside it. Right now, I must say that I love the setting for this arrangement. The move all makes put on the genuine islands of Japan and in genuine spots like Akihabara and Susukino, yet in \"Elder Tale,\" they are situated in a sort of post-whole-world destroying, sword-and-divination environment. \r\nThe arrangement opens with our principlehero, Shiroe. A level-90 conjurer and a somewhat of a maverick, Shiroe stirs midst the diversion world, and after figuring out where he is, starts searching for his companions to see what happened. In brisk request, he discovers his companion, Naotsugu, a patrol who he's quested with some time recently, and Akatsuki, a professional killer/ninja who he's likewise gotten to know. Together, they start to discover some way or another around in this abnormal new reality, arranging with organizations, battling beasts, safeguarding different players, rebuffing miscreants, and attempting to make sense of what they're caught doing here in any case. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a positive vein of outdated courageous dream that goes through Log Horizon. It may turn off viewers more acclimated to seeing the imperfect screw-ups that populate a number of today's stories, however I happen to think its reviving. These heroes are exceedingly experienced players who comprehend what they're doing and you see it in every scene. Shiroe's information of the diversion alone is exhaustive. Anyhow don't believe that these characters are level cardboard cut outs, either. Shiroe is torn between his common propensity to bashfulness and his stature as a legend and pioneer in the \"Senior Tale\" world; Naotsugu, who goes around gloating transparently about being a deviant \u2013 and getting beat on by Akatsuki when he drives her insane \u2013 is by and by honorable, steadfast and kind-hearted, and committed to his companions. Akatsuki, who fights with her own particular questions about meeting expectations in a gathering, is additionally captivated of Shiroe, despite the fact that she would like to reveal to it excessively. \\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon is one of those anime to you will either love or contempt at the outset. I happen to be in the previous party. One of the parts of this demonstrate that I love is the way that the arrangement staff offset key insights about how the universe of 'Elder Tale' functions while not diminishing either the activity or the story line. That is an intense ability to ace in any order, and essayist Syouji Masuda and executive Shinji Ishihara make an incredible showing with it. \\n\\n\r\nIt may not be to everybody's taste, particularly the individuals who are searching for components like the wonderful mournfulness that reverberates from an arrangement like Sword Art Online, however Log Horizon is justified regardless of an attempt, particularly in the event that you like a dated sword and magic story where the great gentlemen dependably win. In this way, here's to the great\\n\\n\r\nArt : 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is a medium kind of thing for me considering most anime have the same likeness so I figure that'd be a 7/10 for most, including this. I don't take much respect to this subject either, hm eh. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound, I'd say...it has those exceedingly pitched Japanese shouts but in the event that that doesn't generally mend you off then you ought to be fine with it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI've depicted the characters and the plot..and on the off chance that you feel this is the kind of anime you'd like to watch, then proceed to watch it. I am certain you'll enjoy it as much as I did! :D",

            "content": "We all know what's going on here another anime based in a MMORPG coincidentally after the mega money milker SAO finished is only natural other studios want to get in on the action while its good. Thus we have been given Log Horizon, a story about large numbers of \"gamers\" who played the MMORPG called Elder Tales get transported into the game for whatever reason..\r\n     Story-- I along with some people went in with the hopes of it not being like SAO or at least not too similar and for a while it was amazing.Our mainprotagonist a socially awkward geek with glasses, who suddenly becomes the Sun Tzu of tactics upon entering the game. This is not such a bad thing considering some of the plans he organize were really clever like something out of spy movie.\\n\\n\r\n     Speaking of espionage there are a heavy uses of politcial and economic mechanics throughout the show. They explain these ideas in a simple and very well thought out fashion. I also enjoyed when they brought modern ideas to a medieval society. I had a great time watching these characters tell a story. Now that we've covered that I will now tell you why I give it the rating I did.\\n\\n\r\n     The story was going well until nearing the end. It looked like the production team just ran out of ideas. and just started stuffing the show with as much generic, boring, cliche garbage. They took all that promising character development and pretty much hit the system reset button, which I will go into greater detail later.\\n\\n\r\n    Art-- It was good, definitely well done and boy did it shine in the fight sequences.\\n\\n\r\n     Sound-- The was good but not really anything memorable\\n\\n\r\n     Characters-- You got a nice assortment Shiro/apparently what they think most veteran gamers look like. Akatsuki/ The jail bait ninja. Naotsugu/ comic relief. This pretty much what they revert back to after all the progress got flushed. Another thing that irked me was what all the average gamers looked like most females were either supermodels or or extremely hot high school students. The background males were either champion weight lifters or introverted child predators(accurate?).  \\n\\n\r\n     Enjoyment-- To put it in simple terms I rode on this train until derailed into a pile of \"fill in the blank\". I want my time back!\\n\\n\r\n     Overall-- I just want finish with what I wanted to say earlier. I don't really think it counts as a spoiler but if so *spoiler alert* They stuffed a ridiculous harem at the it was like a celebratory screw you to all the development and not just any harem we're talking about the entire spectrum from sociably acceptable to 5-10 years no bail. There was so much PLOT in those episodes I thought the server would crash. In conclusion this is NOT sword art online.   \\n",

            "content": "Alright, a lot of you compare this anime to Sword Art Online (SAO), which was an A+ anime. The only similarity between SAO and Log Horizon is that they have a similar story which is people in the real world end up in the video game world of RPG. That's it!\r\nThis anime lacks everything that made SAO amazing, which was the drama, fighting, and great story.\r\nWhat this anime does have is a lot of talking. I mean so much talking. I think the anime should be called Log Horizon the Social Network. Yes, you heard it. There's many of you here that rated this animea 9, and I know and you know for yourself that this anime has more socializing than fighting or anything really. \\n\\n\r\nSo why did I continue to watch this anime? Well, because every episode of talking, I told myself maybe the next episode will be better, and you will continually do this. \\n\\n\r\nBottom line, this anime isn't bad or great, it is just ok. The last episode showed a preview of what's to come, so maybe season 2 will be the anime that we were all waiting for.\\n\\n\r\nDon't believe the 9 ratings or 8 or 7, this anime is a perfect 6, trust me. I'm the truth, I tell you with an honest non bias opinion. \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this anime? Well yeah you should if you have nothing else to watch. If season 2 does get better then I definitely recommend watching this season so at least you know the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon the Social Network gets a pefect 6! \\n\\n\r\nPeace, and send me a like! (the like part is what I hear all these online people say all the time, so I figured I'd say that for fun!)\\n\\n",

            "content": "-Log Horizon \r\nI'm sure many people have seen \"Sword Art Online\" and know all the premises of it, Players are trap trying to Lvl. themselves and trying not to get kill... *Spoiler Alert* in a few episodes you would see how the game is actually played  from the point of view of the protagonist, is not as the player, puts on a helmet and kicks back and plays. In this case the actual game is play in a computer as a normal MMO with the graphics of Runescape not a VRMMORPG like \"Sword Art Online\" but just like SAO all the players that werelog in, are trap without no way out... In the world of \"Elder Tale\" Players aren't really scare of dying, finding later on that if you die you just go back to the main check point and drop all the items they had collected. just like any other MMO.\\n\\n\r\nThe fist episode starts as \"Shiroe\" the main protagonist realize his not on his room, and see that his dress as his avatar, and later he realizes that he's in the world of \"Elder Tale\" after walking around and trying to figure everything out, his able to contact of his friends \"Naotsugu\" as they starts figuring things out.\\n\\n\r\nOf curse the first few episode establish the Plot little by little and is starts slow, just because the players are still figuring things out as how they going to survive, as how much they need to eat, oh much they sleep. It doesn't just kicks in and see everyone trying to LVl.  is more of trying to used human survive skills rather then Lvl. to defeat a Boss\\n\\n\r\nProtagonist & Character\\n\r\nShiroe- Is not your typical * I have a sword and show how i'm better then everyone*Protagonist Instead his a Class (Wizard) strategy and ways to defeat his opponent, and that how he got the name \"Villain in Glasses, but after being so well-known he later realizes that players only invited to there party, just to use him, now Shiroe tries  to find away to get back home.\\n\\n\r\nNaotsugu- Is the loyal friend, witch Class (Guardian) who would do anything to save his friends, even though he  isn't the smart one from the team, his open minded gives that happy and funny atmosphere of not giving up always getting hit by Akatsuki because his small perverted jokes when his around girls.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki- Is the third player they meet in the early episodes being a Class (Ninja) and has later realize that the ninja is a girl, after she drinks a poison  and have made a ninja path to follow Shiroe has his master.\\n\\n\r\nNyata- Nyata is a Cat-like human Class (Swashbucker) that also knows Shiroe from team fights they had before they were trap, Shiroe calls him by the name Chief not only his considers himself a gentleman, for the way he talks and introduces himself. also his able to cook real food in the game, that doesn't taste like *crap* because of his Sub-class.\\n\\n\r\n The series goes slow, just to explain the plot of the story, the character development, starts slow just the facts that their nothing outside the game that makes this character any more interesting, but in half way shows how they adapted in the game and how the players interact with reach other. Instead of just seating around wanting to die. If you the person to have the passions to see how everything unfolds, in the early episodes you would be pleased.. Hopefully this helped :) \\n\\n\r\n-Jorvaldez12\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hi there guys! Don't worry about spoiler, I won't do spoilers. (and excuse me for my poor english ^^ i'm working on it) \r\nI'm going to tell you my opinion about Log horizon, what I think and some points about it.\r\nLog horizon; imagine, You buy a new expansion for your favorite MMORPG, You run it and then... YOU ARE IN THE GAME! you wake up inside the game, YOU are extremly scared, confused, LOST! What are you doing there? WHY are you there? HELP ME ! I need go outside back to my life!!! Indeed, you will be stunned. however, you can't be without doingnothing for all your life, you must continue your life even if you are traped in a game. \\n\\n\\n\r\nShiroe (the protagonist) is not the only traped. ALL the players that tried playing with the expansion (when it came out) are confined. \\n\\n\\n\r\nLog horizon tells the story of what the players do to survive and all the problems that appears. The problems are things that you don't imagine when you are playing an MMORPG... but... wait.. they are logical, and... IT MAY BE TRUE! Who thinks when is playing a game that an NPC has feelings? \\n\\n\r\nI must say some negative points aswell. For example, people can't die. HMMM! I don't like it at all, I mean, if i'm having a battle against a monster and i can't die... what's the emotion there? Kill him. if you die, do it again. you have time (REMEMBER ~ you are confined ;) ).\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother annoying part is the innocence of the characters. I never liked it in anime. PEOPLE, this is a game, YOU CAN KILL, NOTHING WILL HAPPEN! (IF he is a human, he will revive!) Or when they are CRYING saying '' OH NOOO, I'M GOING TO DIE!'', and then i think: ''so what?''\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if you liked SAO (as i did), and you want more of it (although very different in some points), this is your anime.\\n\\n\r\nApproach (8/10) \\n\\n\r\nAbout the music. It has a great music and they know exactly when to put it to convert a stupid moment into a sad one (for example). \\n\\n\r\nMusic (8/10) \\n\\n\r\nWhen you come to speak about characters, some of them are extremly cool, original and special although others are boring, repetitive and... the anime doesn't need them. \\n\\n\r\ncharacters (5/10) \\n\\n\r\nAbout filler... it has some moments I'd call filler... and it is very annoying although it is really easy to difference and you can just leave that part.\\n\\n\r\nBeing 0 too much filler and 10 nothing;\\n\\n\r\nfiller (5/10)\\n\\n\r\ndid i enjoy it? OH yeah, i did, more the beginning than the middle-end but i'm glad of have seen it. I would call this anime a basic shonen for those people which call themselves ''veteran'' of anime. \\n\\n\r\nfunny (8/10) \\n\\n\r\nFinally, Is this anime worth? Well, after all and comparating with other animes I think it is worth, but if you are asking if it is better than most anime, I guess this is just a good one, not a master piece. \\n\\n\r\nWorth (7/10) \\n\\n\\n\r\nGeneral mark  7/10   (I may be too hard with it :P)",

            "content": "On a day known as The Apocalypse, Shiroe and two hundred thousand other players wake up in a world that resembles the world of the sword and sorcery MMORPG  Elder Tale.  Shiroe (a strategist) is accompanied primarily by Akatsuki (an assassin) and Naotsugu (a guardian/tank). The three of them meet up during The Apocalypse and set out together to learn what is going on in their world. Early on they find out some very basic truths about the world:\r\nYou cannot log out of the game\r\nDying in the game does not get you out of the game, you just revive at the Cathedral (arespawn point)\\n\r\nThe control screens seem to be part of their normal field of vision\\n\r\nCharacters can perform attacks and spells freely by simply moving their bodies or using vocal commands\\n\r\nFood and drink provided by the game have no taste and a uniform consistency, but people do still get hungry\\n\r\nLike with hunger, they do feel pain when they are attacked\\n\r\nThe portals in the game have been shut down making it difficult to travel between large cities.\\n\\n\r\nIt also turns out that Shiroe is famous for being a member of a legendary raid party known as \u201cDebauchery Tea Party\u201d (Naotsugu was also a member). His brilliant strategies and cold demeanor had earned him the nickname, \u201cVillain in Glasses\u201d. Despite not ever joining a guild (the predominant social structure in this online game) Shiroe is very well known and respected by other players. He\u2019s even helped several of the obtain items or complete quests. Because of this he is contacted by the leader of the Cresent Moon Guild in the game city of Akihabara for help figuring out what is going on with the world.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Shiroe is brought up to speed on what\u2019s happening he starts to complete jobs and tasks while still gaining information about the state of the new world that he lives in. In addition to the players (called adventurers) he notices that there has also been a change in the NPCs (called People of the Land). Shiroe also realizes that, in this world, people lack purpose. They don\u2019t need anything to survive since they cannot die and there is no real societal structure for them to live in which has caused some places to fall apart. Shiroe makes it his goal to build the city of Akihabara into a place that will be pleasant for both the Adventurers and People of the Land to live in. In doing so, he will discover more and more things that he has to deal with in this new world.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Log Horizon feels like a plug and play anime. They flipped the roles of a few character archetypes, altered the rules of the game and then just plugged that into the general formula for a \u201cwe\u2019re stuck in a virtual world\u201d show. This feeling comes in large part because they take certain aspects of the genre for granted. For example, no one seems to really care HOW, they ended up trapped in this game world. Beyond that no one even really seems concerned. The characters seem to be incredibly well acclimated to the world of the game. This is really strange because this isn\u2019t a virtual reality game, it\u2019s a standard desktop game. This means the players aren\u2019t used to being in some kind of augmented reality. Still, no one freaks out or panics, they just go on living their lives in the game. Another issue, that goes hand in hand with the lack of exposition, is that there\u2019s a lack of discovery. Almost everyone in the show seems to know or be familiar with each other from before the show began. This really robs the audience of the chance to discover the characters in the same way. It\u2019s like showing up at a party and everyone else there has known each other for years, it just doesn\u2019t make you feel welcome.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also the issue of what feels like overly simple production. I found it interesting that the entire 25 episodes keeps the same opening and closing theme since the trend seems to be to change those every 12-13 episodes. I found it less interesting that the show seemed to be content with using the lowest common denominator when it came to character design and animation. Everything is relatively bland with the exception of one or two scenes where they wanted to make the scenery look really nice. The characters don\u2019t really have a lot of\u2026well\u2026character to their designs everyone is just a kind of generic anime character. I guess it\u2019s appropriate because the characters themselves aren\u2019t really that developed either. In the whole 25 episodes I don\u2019t think we see more than one instance of actual character growth. Even though the story the characters are used to tell is interesting, the characters themselves aren\u2019t. Shiroe may be the one exception to that statement, but that\u2019s probably because his character is the great catalyst for change and plot progression in this show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the show does well (and better than most other shows in it\u2019s same genre) is being true to the feel of an MMORPG. The screens and jargon in the show are more true to the feel of what an actual game is like. It also nails the sense of community that is so prevalent in online games. In real life, online games are communities within society. However, in this show the community is separated from society and is left to either run wild or to form its own kind of society. Shiroe takes it upon himself to be the catalyst for creating that society. Watching Shiroe manipulate and construct a society in this very unusual world is interesting. What makes this so interesting and so fun to watch is that the society is growing inside the rules of an existing structure: the game.\\n\\n\r\nWe don\u2019t know exactly what all of the rules of the game are but the players do and it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re used to working the system. Everything that\u2019s done by the experienced players feels like the move of a veteran game player. The winners of their fights are determined not by a character level but by how well a team can fight together and by the strategy that they use. When they talk to the People of the Land, it reads just like you would expect a \u201cpick the right path\u201d conversation with an NPC in a game. They manipulate the conversations to achieve the results they desire. The game itself is also constantly reacting to the adventurers actions. It\u2019s so much like a game that it\u2019s hard to tell whether or not the world is actually trying to guide the players to some undisclosed end-game. That makes the story feel very organic.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a much truer adaptation of the feel of an MMORPG than many of it\u2019s genre predecessors but that is it\u2019s strongest point. As an anime, it is lacking in having an overarching plot which can make it hard to get invested in the show because of a general feeling of a lack of direction. That being said, it is still fun to watch if you can get over some of those holes. The show does seem to prefer to tell stories in smaller chunks and through their characters. Overall, I\u2019d give the show a 7/10 with room for it to improve based on how the 2nd season pans out.",

            "content": "On the first glance, Log Horizon, was like a cheap copy of Sword Art Online (which was not exactly the best anime ever, being good even though). 4-5 episodes passed and I was thrilled. Suddenly I understood the difference. As a gamer, and a person that used to spent a lot of time on MMO games, this was a real hit.\r\nThey were actually in a world, that was a game in every single bit. It was a MMO in every single bit. Every detail that a MMO game could have was implemented in the anime, they knew what they were doing from the very beginning.And that is what I liked the most. The details they managed to put into it, even small things. \\n\r\nAnd if you are a gamer, you will understand every single bit of what the characters are doing, and how they behave, its impossible to not love this anime, when you are a gamer.\\n\r\nIt's a adventurous experience with a ton of thinking and plot to it. I am a big fan of this thing! \\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\\n\r\nThis anime seems to be nothing you expect it to be. In the beginning I thought that the storyline is not polished and pretty simple, hopelessly copied, that's what I thought. \\n\r\nAnd then you see that sudden change, and you understand everything.\\n\r\nBasically, people that played the game called Elder Tale, woke up in the game, like it was real life.\\n\r\nEverything became a chaos. People had to unite, had to form some sort of government, some sort of law, some sort of city and community. \\n\r\nAnd then the world progresses.\\n\r\nAnd you witness the beautifulness of it.\\n\\n\r\nVIBE:\\n\r\nFor me this certain vibe is special. It is because you can feel that these people are gamers, and like every serious gamer, they are unique in their own way. I like it, because I can sympathize with those people a lot, I can almost feel what they feel. I can understand their problems there, and the thing they are afraid of.\\n\r\nAnd also their very desires.\\n\r\nAnd well, let's be honest. It's essentially a game, they are in a game. How could I not love that world!\\n\r\nSometimes, because of that. You might think, for just a while.\\n\r\nWould you actually want to be in a world like this?\\n\r\nCoz that is a question, theyve been asking themselves this whole time.\\n\r\nYou better think about it, Im not the one telling you, what you need to do.\\n\r\nIt's your damn life.\\n\\n\r\nART STYLE:\\n\r\nI do really think, that the art style could be a lot better. I don't find it either original nor good. It's even below average. They happened to make everything a bit \"squaery\", which is what I don't really like. Some characters that are supposed to be pretty or cute, are essentially not, which is a shame. Because they try to convince you that they are that way.\\n\r\nAlthough I do think that fights are done with a great detail, animation quality there, seems to be good enough. And then, I even hate to say it. Sometimes it's bad, because it's just made with worse quality! You have to be consistent with what you are doing.\\n\r\nI can also say, that there is a purpose for the art style to be that way, but even though it could have been prettier. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICEACTING:\\n\r\nSome tracks from the soundtrack are awesome, and some are not to even listen. At least I dont like them, unfortunately the these worse ones, make the majority of the soundtrack. They tend to fuse a woman singing voice track with a 8bit old-school track. I don't like that, they should keep themselves to one thing.\\n\r\nVoiceacting is nice, I didnt find any voice being unattractive or not matching the character, because that tends to happen sometimes.\\n\r\nThey even managed to get some surprising manners of talking from the voices we already heard, which was indeed incredible. I like when a whole character develops, it makes it more enjoyable to watch them do stuff.  \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nIn the conclusion I would say that this is a good anime, with a bunch of flaws in it. I like it, I'm a gamer, how may I not love it. But I can see those things I consider bad, and it decreases in my eyes. Although I can recommend it to any serious gamer on this planet, they will surely enjoy it! And they will surely respect the main character, he is a gamer with a soul.\\n\\n\r\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/KqN-3EHahrg\\n",

            "content": "First off, this anime is NOTHING LIKE SAO, other than the fact that they are stuck in an MMORPG. Despite that, SAO was the main reason why I tried Log Horizon out in the first place, so that's what I'll be comparing it to.\r\nBeing a MMORPG player and a person who likes to excessively ponder in my free time, I was very intrigued by the premise of SAO and dove straight into it, expecting some serious social evolution, teamwork, and philosophical ideas tied around the game rules and the death mechanic. Suffice to say, I was sorely disappointed. This is where Log Horizon comes in.\r\nTheFocus\\n\r\nWhile SAO focused on action scenes and the harem-esque romance, Log Horizon focuses on pure world building and social evolution. SAO was a fight to the death, LH is more of a social experiment. In LH you can't do much by yourself, so you must help each other in order to overcome the challenges thrown at you. This is just so much more enjoyable to watch then one person who can overcome all conflict by just trying hard enough.\\n\r\nAnother major difference is how both anime handle death. In SAO, you die, no questions asked (unless you're the main character). In Log Horizon, you respawn at the city cathedral. While this doesn't give a sense of fear and anxiety like SAO, it is not Log Horizon's focus and so takes away nothing from its core concepts. If you like the suspense and finality of death in SAO, you won't find it here in LH. (To be perfectly honest SAO didn't do so well with that either. By ep. 8 I had assumed that all the important characters would survive).\\n\\n\r\nThe World\\n\r\nThe world LH creates just breathes with life, from the 'enhanced' game mechanics to the NPCs... the NPCs!!! I cannot express the brilliance of how they made the NPCs work. There is a sense of scale to the world, and the upcoming episodes look very promising for an all out war. The guilds show the development of a community and is a much more realistic way of how players would react when thrown into a situation like this. Sure there were guilds in SAO, but they really didn't do anything and didn't mean anything in the long run. In LH you cannot hope to achieve anything unless you work together. The combat system heavily reflects on this, with tanks, damage dealers, support, healing, etc... Teamwork, not solo double hack-n-slash.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters\\n\r\nI found the characters in LH much easier to like and relate to. In SAO it's either Kirito or Asuna, maybe Suguha or Yui too. I ended up disliking all four of them (one was a generic OP hero, two were generic harem partners, and the last sadly wasn't developed quite enough), and none of the other characters showed up on the screen enough for me to personally understand them.\\n\r\nIn LH, there is a lot more to choose from, as every character continues to keep doing things as time goes on. That's another thing that bugged me. In SAO (if they didn't die), once the character goes off screen after the 3 episodes they were in, it's like time stopped for them, and they were never seen again, unless they were evil and needed to be killed by a certain duel-wielding super soldier or it was because it's the final battle. Every character in LH does something, and continues to do so even when the main characters are off on diplomatic summits or negotiating trade prices. It's a much richer experience and helps provide the feeling of constant action, especially during the would-be slower parts.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nLog Horizon is a solid piece of work which strives to give a vastly different experience and feel compared to SAO. If you've watched SAO and have felt like it could have done better with its MMORPG premise, I would highly recommend Log Horizon. As it stands right now, I cannot wait for the next episode.",

            "content": "So\u2026 Log Horizon. \r\nStory:\r\nOkay so story\u2026 First of all you have to understand, there isn't really an over-arching plot. More like a group of sub-plots. This anime is very driven towards the idea of what would happen if people were forced to live inside an MMO. The characters aren't exactly trying all their hardest to escape. There also isn't a lot of action, so if you enjoy action packed anime this may not be for you. It's more of a politics and ethics sort of story. \r\nArt:\r\nI'm not really too picky about art style, so pretty much anything looks good to me. The character designswere great and so were the backgrounds. So yeah, great art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't anything amazing. It wasn't horrible either. At first I just skipped the opening, but I eventually grew to like it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI must say I really enjoyed the characters in this series. They all seem to have some depth, although you don't get any backstory for most of them. I don't really have much to say other than they were good so\u2026 yeah.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI must admit I considered dropping this anime quite a few times. The beginning is sort of slow, but the show does pick up. At the end I really enjoyed this anime. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a fantasy/MMO setting and wants to have an in depth world. \\n\\n",

(The similarities with shows like SAO can stop here) Elder Tale is a far more thought out world than you expect and the characters themselves are solid in all respects. \r\nFor me the show could have scored an 8 or 9 but the reason it didn't where for things it didn't have to do and could have fixed. \r\n1) The story lacks a proper pace, it is bogged down at times with filler especially towards the end of the show\r\n2) There is well to much politics. Ican understand though for people who like this sort of thing. I am all for it if it expands the world of Elder Tale. But it dedicated episodes to events that could have been mentioned in a brief conversation and allow the viewer to get on with the main plot.\\n\\n\r\n3) The cast of characters really don't have equal development, a lot of the characters are left out in favour for the main 3 and even saying that it is mainly the lead Shiroe who is the most developed. \\n\\n\r\nLastly the show lacked a lot of action considering it was an MMO, it had a few really nice set pieces or stop out moments but like mentioned before was really bogged down with trying to be a depth political powerhouse. This also caused the ending to really suffer but I am holding out on season 2 hoping it learns from this. \\n\\n\r\nIt has some good concepts, I just hope they get more time to shine next time.",

            "content": "LOG HORIZON REVIEW:\r\nMINDSET:\r\n*LITERALLY ABSOLUTLY NOTHING*\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nSome game called Elder Tale created a near-apocalyptic event which in that day, the players that have logged in and were sucked into the games world. The protagonist Shiro and he's friends work together as helping freelancers to all sorts of random stuff, like killing a monk, helping a loli etc. It usually centrers around Shiro, as he soon decides to replicate real-life society with Elder Tale, as everything has become corrupt. It is up to he's new guild \u201cLog Horizon\u201d to create a new and working society that benefits everyone.\r\nREVIEW:\r\nLets start out with the good stuff. Even us more professionalcritics agree, that Log Horizons biggest strength is \u201cWorld Building\u201d You truly get a grasp of this world, how it works and how it has develop. To be honest, its quite fun for me look back on what I learnt at certain episodes, to revise thorough certain pieces of knowledge. This truly puts in favour of its pacing, like Shinsekai Yori, the pacing of the show gradually shows You an ever more and expanding world. (for the most part) the reactions and development on our barren wasteland, to a fully working society is a really fascinating look.\\n\\n\r\nYou see major discoveries, like how if You cooked Your self instead of using the command panel, will add actual flavour onto the food, instead of it tasting like plain Yoghurt. Or how wealthy guilds invest money to research technology, by using the knowledge they used to have the world develops quickly. You see laws being added, wars breaking lose, inventions of items that cannot be made in real-life can all add up to a very immersible fantasy realm. \\n\\n\r\nConsequently, there are moments with flawed writing. My case and point? Some of the world building can be quite unrealistic and some plot pints feel forced and rather out of place, like how the origin of Elder Tale was before the age of Adam & Eve, it was the Elves who came before the humans as this super advance race. There are moments like these which subconsciously makes me face palm to how dum the writing can be in certain moments, and yes without spoiling it, the Lore of the original Elder Tale was down side for me...\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the fact that the show centrers around world building, it has no grey morality which gives out a few minuses since You can obviously tell who is the villain. And also, the villains are totally one dimensional turds of writing.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue to stress out, (technically I can call that a flaw) is the fact that You still get the same feel and aura of the shows world building. (I know it could be hard to explain but please grasp on my explanation) You only get fascinated by the shows \u201cWorld Building\u201d this means that You do not truly feel emotion, or tension when reality hits hard, because of the charcters... Yep, I'm addressing this issue again...\\n\\n\r\nWe have overall great world building, so what about a cast to back it up? With a cast that can be completely summarised with one word or a one liner, this makes them feel like the same overused cookie cutter flat and uncomplex archetypes all over again. At the end of the series, they do not develop. Sure there were a very small handful that had legit development, but overall, it doesn\u2019t reward any more redeeming factors on the entire cast. The only character that kind of shines above the rest would be Shiro, he's a very logical thinker, the most OP tactician in the series, but personality wise, he still reminiscent of the same generic protagonist vibe that I see with far too many modern Anime these days. Roriconfan describes characters like these, as Vanilla, a character who seems to have a lesser persona, and just reacts at everything.... He gets barely any development even though he gets the most screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few pretty above average characters, but the ratio is like 3/100 of other characters that I've already forgotten there names, but again, there really nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nThe only special mention of the OST, would be the OP, its great, sure it doesn\u2019t fit the whole theme of a fantasy series but its just a piece of some really cool J-Pop with really cool beats! The ED is so average that it kind of sucks, so just skip it. (there is nothing special about it) For the rest of the OST, its Your completely generic fantasy OST with your violins, trumpets, etc. With only one memorable song. It is sufficient on its job, and fits the mood nicely. But I'm no musician, so I can't critique it in a very in-depth and critical manner!\\n\\n\r\nThis goes the same for the Animation, again, nothing special. It is again, sufficient on its job and doesn\u2019t have anything note worthy. However, I really like it because it remains very consistent, threes not one moment when it felt like downgrading, or upgrading and the action scenes look pretty cool and fluid. Its overall very consistent and nice! Sure the use of colours is rather minimalistic, and character designs are fairly above average for the most part with nicely distinguishing features in each design but its good.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nAfter so many years passing, this show is going to be decently well remembered for its great (though flawed) world building, it has a few decent characters and an awesome OP to be remembered, its truest legacy would feel like a very fun and  animated, quirky geography lesson that is 24 volumes long, with a bit history in the mix made in Japan!\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n4.5/10 For a nothing special plot, with very above average world building.\\n\r\n3.5/10 With a forgettable and large cast that were not very well directed.\\n\r\n6/10 As its sufficient Animation only redeeming factor is the very consistent budget. And good designs.\\n\r\n6.5/10 For a good OST, and bonus points for a great OP\\n\r\n6.5/10 As an enjoyable Geography lesson (nothing else)\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 4/10 Only for the cool geography lessons will it not suck.",

            "content": "What can I say? Log Horizon is basically something like SAO and .//Hack, but it is at the same time completely different. While SAO goes off on several tangents completely unrelated, think Lisbeth and Silica, Log Horizon stays focused on the MMO side of such a situation. Assuming you know the basics of the story, lets begin!\r\nThere are obviously a few faults to Log Horizon. The reason I voted this that high is a) it deserves more love and should go up in the anime list and b) is leagues better, in my opinion, than some of the stuff coming out these days. The mainglaring fault in it is that many of the characters seem perfectly at ease in their new environment, the former MMO 'Elder Tale', now their world. No one panicked, there was no mass hysteria or anything, and frankly, this was done much better in SAO's episode one. However, it is becomes apparent that they haven't forgotten their situation but have attempted to adjust.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes of Log Horizon are there to establish a setting. It starts out slow, which unfortunately lost a few watchers, explaining basic MMO concepts and features, introducing the main cast and so on. Around episode 5 it picks up, having finished a sort of prologue and begins the main story. If you hang around until then, you won't be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nThere are several plot twists that were actually fun to watch, of which I only managed to guess two. Log Horizon also focuses on the premise of 'politics'. If you think about it, it is obviously pretty important, given that the several thousand in Elder Tale have no overarching law governing them. Anarchy is obviously an effect, and this is what the protagonist attempts to solve. This was actually pretty refreshing from the recurring theme of violence solves everything that seems to come up in Anime. It may sometimes get slow, but if you bear with it you won't be disappointed!\\n\\n\r\nArt wise, there is certainly quite a bit more left to desire. While Log Horizon's art is in no way bad, in fact it is very well done, it is not very good either, going more on mediocre. It does not really affect your enjoyment of the show. Several special effects were done pretty well, especially skills of the players, but other than that there wasn't any real eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nSound, I felt, was pretty good. Unfortunately I only really pay attention to the OP and ED, and in this case both were nice. The OP had several English lyrics, and the tune in general was nice. I tended to skip the ED though. The OSTs were all good, but the fact that none really come to mind show that it isn't anything extremely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is one of the strong points. Shiroe's development isn't explicitly shown, but his slow growth from introvert to leader is done very well. Several side characters are also done pretty well, but some were neglected, like Naotsugu and Nyanta (btw this guy is weird... Nyanta that is. Idk why). And the romance in this has left much to be desired; in that the little that is there isn't done very well, especially who likes who. I felt that it didn't really fit with the series, they should have gotten most of it off.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon is one of the better series to air recently. While it certainly does lack in some areas, it overall more than makes up for it. Consider watching it, chances are, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

            "content": "\"I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow in the knee.\"\r\n     While searching for a new show to pick-up on MAL, I happened to stumble on to Log Horizon.  Now I'm not one who randomly watches shows; I watch the same types, genres, etc.  As soon as I read the description for Log Horizon, I thought to myself, it's just a copy of Sword Art Online.  But even if it was, the show did have high scores and that definitely piqued my interest.  I also took the time to read yaHzee's reviewof the show which made me decide to invest time in this series.  And boy, did I enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\n     The story is great.  It never felt rushed; just everything went nicely with the flow.  There was no major drama or plot point that I felt was drawn out too long.  Each little scenario built upon another to keep the story going.  Be warned, there is a lot of politics in this show.  Luckily for the good guys, they are able to solve it.  Now if you like the idea where the main characters agonize over decisions and consequences, this may not work out for you.  I don't mean to say they don't struggle with problems, but they sure do solve them quickly.  In any case, I didn't complain about that as I'm not into plot points that tend to drag on.\\n\\n\r\n     Art and sound were good as well.  The animation is good and clean and the locations and towns were beautiful.  I had no complaints with the music; actually, I don't remember any music from any particular scene which stood out but I certainly didn't hate it.  As for the intro and ending songs, they are definitely catchy if you give them a try.\\n\\n\r\n     Now let's talk about characters.  This can sink a show or make it extremely enjoyable.  I love that MAL lets you favorite characters you like; although, I would really like it if you can make a list of characters you hate.  The nice thing was there really weren't any characters in the show that I hated.  And this then brings us to our main character, Shiroe.  To be honest, I really enjoy watching shoujo anime.  And one of the biggest reasons is that the guys in shoujo anime aren't complete douches.  Unfortunately, shounen anime are crowded with wimpy losers who believe in the power of friendship.  I have really come to hate that.  But Shiroe is different.  He is intelligent and is the strategist in the show.  He isn't one to charge in recklessly and does think through the problems the heroes come across.  He is definitely in my list of great anime male characters.  The other characters were great as well and I really enjoyed the interactions that occurred among them, especially when they strategize their next move.  Other characters seemed unremarkable but did grow on you eventually, like the other guild masters who had their own roles to play.  A win in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the enjoyment.  I've never played an MMORPG so I don't understand all of it.  But I have played my fair share of RPGs at one time or another and yes, I am a Skyrim fanboy.  One of the things that I loved in SAO was that when the boss fights would commence, everyone would fight together.  But this wasn't often.  In Log Horizon, it's all about the party and the fights are in groups.  Heck, they even make an army and go all out on the enemy forces.  This really made me want to play Log Horizon and get stuck in that world.  The medieval world and it's game setting combined with the ingenuity of the modern man makes for some great ideas which this show is full of.  I heartily recommend it.",

            "content": "In my anime, as my games, story/setting/gameplay/one intriguing premise or idea can save the characters, and vice versa. And this is where Log Horizon is muddy for me. Let's start with the positives, setting and art.\r\nRecently, likely with the advent and popularity of SAO, many MMO-based anime have been released. Log Horizons interpretation, as many gamers will likely sympathyize with, is BRILLIANT. Stats, mmo-style interfaces, classes, items - you take one 5 minute battle out of this show and all the basics of an MMO are there. One part I quite like (minor spoliers!) is when the show makes one character cook as oppose tojust 'magic up' food, and funnily enough it makes the food tastes 10x better (END OF SPOILERS) \\n\r\nSo, story, brilliant. Art, standard modern anime fare but still lovely eye-candy. Both a great 8.\\n\\n\r\nNow, sound and character. First, easy one, sound - uuhh, meh. The opening I think is really awesome, the ending isn't bad, and everything else is really meh and REPEATED THROUGHOUT THE SHOW. This can be an OK thing, good thing (a la Angel Beats), but with it being so meh in this show, bar one 'drama incoming' piano interlude I quite liked, it's rather grating.\\n\r\nAnd here comes the difficult part... The show has quite the cast for a non-shounen show, so I'll outline the mains:\\n\r\nShinroe, the main protagonist and strategist of 'Log Horizon' (the casts guild). He's cool-headed and I liked him to start, but he became bland as the show went on, in my opinion. \\n\r\nAkatsuki is a 17 y.o. (I'm 80% sure) ninja. Any more needs to be said? I love her... Oh, and she's a love interest for Shinroe. 'Cause. \\n\r\nNyanta is a cat-swordsman. Again, I'd say need anymore be said but to avoid beating a dead horse... He's like suppose to be this bad-ass, 'I can diffuse a situation with my mouth or sword' character but comes off a bit of a Shinroe clone. \\n\r\nNaotsugi makes up the original fighting trio of Shinroe and Akatsuki, (before Shinroe got involved in politics and Akatsuki stalked him as self proclaimed 'servant' *cough stalker cough* because Shinroe said something about needing her at one point) and is Shinroe's IRL good friend. He's the comedy relief character, obsessed with panties meathead but he's brave and  I really like him as well! \\n\r\nMinori I think was supposed to be the most interesting, being introduced halfway in and wanting to learn from 'Master Shinroe' but, yet again, becomes another clone AND another love interest! Saying that, because of the love triangle that is ever so omnipresent in every anime, episode 22 I think pokes fun at that concept which made me laugh a lot, despite having nothing to do with an MMO about it. \\n\\n\r\nOther than those above there's a princess, a main baddy as well as your general MMO-fare enemies (which is introduced episode 24 of 25! They were optomistic for a S2, which is out so...) and a cast of supporting characters that usually have a link with Shiroe, Naotsugi or Minori. \\n\\n\r\nSo, after that essay, do I recommend this? Eehh hard to say. If you like SAO, and I mean REALLY enjoyed it, you're likely to enjoy this, as it's a lot of the same to be fair. If you enjoyed but got bored of SAO, or outright hate SAO, then probably give this a miss and, from what my friends keep banging on I need to watch, give Summer Wars a go. Thanks for reading, and I'll see you next show!",

What may seem to be a filler episode never fails to remind us that Shiro has something planned or the enemies are plotting something. The show also had an excellent balance of humor and drama.\r\nThe art was nothing special for me but it was above average. Scenes were well animated.\r\nThe opening song, goddamn, that was one of the best I've heard in a while. Gets you really pumped up. The ending song was not bad as well.\r\nShiro was a 10/10 for me. I can empathize withthe socially awkward aspect. But his shrewd and cunning and how he used it in the show was amazing. Minori was too irritating that's why I can't give character aspect a perfect score. Damn she is obnoxious as hell.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a solid series in the trapped-in-an-MMORPG genre.

            "content": "*Note This is basically a re-post modified to be a full review of the series since it's already finished airing and the last one was written halfway through the series.  \r\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty I'll just get one thing out of the way: I'm a fan of both Mamare Touno and Kawahara Reki and no one (not even the zealous hardliners from both camps) can make me feel otherwise. W/ that said let's get it on shall we?\r\nLog Horizon is about thousands of players of an internationally acclaimed Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) Elder Tales suddenly find themselves trapped insidea world eerily similar to that of the game w/ them looking like their in-game avatars. \\n\\n\r\nI imagine a lot of people unconsciously muttering \"SAO clone\" after that first paragraph and turn themselves away from their monitors at breakneck speed changing the web page afterwards. I don't exactly blame them seeing as how horribly SAO was adapted. But that's an entirely different issue. Anyway it's not like SAO and LH were the first series to use MMOs as a theme. There are countless other works both in the West and in Asia (the Koreans love this stuff) w/c have similar themes. That and comparing SAO and LH is like comparing apples and oranges. Both are fruits. I find them both tasty. But they're not entirely similar that trying to justify w/c one is better than the other is an act of futility. People like different stuff. And I admit that my scoring is based on my preferences but I'll still endeavor to cover the various elements of this series objectively.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and cause some are a bit miffed that I didn't mention .hack// I'll put it in here too. And, no, this isn't just a \"spur of the moment\" thing. No, seriously. Guys I love Kite, Haseo and the gang too. You've gotta believe me...\\n\\n\r\n(Story/Characters)\\n\r\nThat said LH has quite a different feel from other series w/c use the said theme. For one if you know Mamare Touno then you most likely agree that he is one of the reigning kings when it comes to world building and character development (at least that's what I'd like to believe). If you are familiar w/ his other work (Maou Maoyuu Yuusha) or another series w/ a similar feel (Spice and Wolf) then chances are you already have a good idea what to expect. The series has heavy socio-political undertones coupled w/ economics and lot's of interesting and colorful characters (in my book). It also takes its sweet time in developing the plot and characters so those who are expecting a brisker pacing may be turned off at a couple of eps featuring almost nothing but dialogue (albeit greatly presented). \\n\\n\r\nShiroe (MC) is one of the more interesting MCs I've come across in that he's not exactly the brute force of the party but the brains w/c is rare for a Shounen series (although one can argue the novels can actually be classified as Seinen but we're talking about the adaptation here). What makes him so interesting for me is that in order to realize his goals and protect those dear to him he has no qualms about using more \"underhanded\" or \"villainous\" methods to get things done. He also has no problem playing \"bad cop\" and ruining his public image if it is for the benefit of the greater whole. His nick 'Villain in Glasses\" (Black-heart glasses in the novel translations) describes him to a tee. He does have genuinely good intentions but just like any good zealot he lives to the idea \"The ends justify the means\". Those close to him trust him enough to believe in whatever decision he makes but those unfamiliar w/ him just view him as a dangerous element. \\n\\n\r\nAnd Shiroe is just one of the relatively large cast of characters LH has. Almost every one from the open pervert Naotsugu, cute loli assasin Akatsuki, gentle-cat-person and superb chef Nyanta, lovable big breasted kansaiben oneesan Marielle, amazing megane accountant and Akatsukis number 1 fan Henrietta...... I could go on forever w/ this but yeah almost all of the characters are interesting and chances you'll find someone you'll love.\\n\\n\r\nSome may complain about some scenes that feel \"off\" or seem like a departure from what was established in the first few eps. While I'll refrain from debating whether these scenarios are better off being included or not I'll just say that LH is over all a multi-layered series. It isn't purely about action, political maneuvering and economic ploys. Nor is it purely about romance (Did people just cringe there?...). It has a story w/c is a mesh of different elements and, if it's any consolation, no detail is left out to be irrelevant. All come together as the plot advances. Even \"those\" scenes.  \\n\\n\r\n(Art/Sound)\\n\r\nI'd always liked the novel illustrations and am very satisfied at the fact that the characters do look like their novel illustration selves. The animation could have used a bit more work though but seeing as it's NHK I'm not really complaining that much. Lenessia and Akatsuki are ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!!!... Uuuh... yeah. Sorry bout that. Anyway, as for the music, there are some stand out themes here and there and they fit well into the scenes they play in. The OP can be a mixed bag. Some (myself included) may love it so much that they find themselves humming \"Database! Database!\" all over the place. And some would rather listen to Frank Sinatra (I don't have anything against mister Sinatra mind you. Really. Don't flame me.). The ED is ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!!! Yeah, can't help it. Sorry. The OP and ED don't change throughout the series run so that in itself can be a testament to their quality. Either that or NHK-E just doesn't have the budget for another OP/ED. We may never know... \\n\\n\r\n(Overall)\\n\r\nAll in all LH has superb word building, and expansive and engaging cast and an interesting MC to keep you hooked. It's one of those series w/c actually makes you use your noggin a bit and this makes you understand why it's aired on a government sponsored edutainment channel aimed at kids despite being Shounen. Oh, and yeah, there are action scenes too but they're only a part of the narrative. But they are well placed. \\n\\n\r\nAlso if you're looking for a series that evokes nostalgia for the old school MMOs that took over our misspent youths look no further. LH has that in spades considering that it was based on Everquest and the key here is not \"trapped in a virtual MMO\" but \"transported to an alternate world resembling our favorite desktop/console MMO played w/ mouse and keyboard\". \\n\\n\r\n*Do note that the MMO theme might be a mixed bag (Some would like the explanations about MMO gaming in general and some may feel annoyed since they already know the stuff and feel like they're being treated like noobs.) and the MMO feel kinda tapers off towards the end of the series. But, again, remember that LH is a multi layered series. The story shifting from world building to character-centric is part of the overall package. It's up to you guys if you'll like the transition or not. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it may have its slightly annoying moments I find it an honestly enjoyable series. But it's not for everyone.\\n\\n\r\n*P.S. I, being the shameless fanboy that I am, will take this chance to encourage you guys to read the novels. You'll find a lot of things that were not included in the TV adaptation (since it's NHK-E and the censoring is unavoidable) and you'll get to enjoy another aspect of the series. Thanks for reading the review guys.",

            "content": "This is just a quick review about log horizon. Where should i start? First of all, i could say this is one of the most boring and illogical anime i' ve seen and i dropped it at just 11 ep cause i couldn t no longer resist..Why? Don' t get fooled by that \"action-adventure\" like me..because it's just a SLOW SLOW slice of life fantasy full of political and diplomatic situations, oh and guess what?stereotypes characters.\r\nThe worst thing i just can't handle is the hate for the \"similar\" SAO wich is ten times better.No seriously.. if you're thinking this ugly copy is better there issomething wrong with you.. I can understand for the spells, classes and the whole Rpg sistem etc but stop.. the rest are just boring useless speechs who make you slee.. Zzzz\\n\r\nThere will be many confronts with Sao in this review since many people recommend it for its similar settings but They are Two completely different things,Sao is a love story so deal with it.\\n\r\nBy the way, i will just write what i criticize the most and the reason why it is a very bad anime.\\n\r\nLet's start from the beginning.. You got stuck in a RPG game with no chance to escape and what s your first reaction? Fear? Anxiety? Nahh let s take a walk and call my old friend..(few moments later,when they met) \"oh man so you're stuck in the game too..\"  \"Yea, woo i ve always thought you were a tall man!\" \"Hoho that s exactly how i imagined you..look at you, with those glasses\" Mm..And while you are at it, order two coffee please oh my god, this is one of the first conversations. Thus the question arises: wtf is happening? .I want you to remind the first ep of Sao.. the air was full of terror.. You just got trapped in a game and you can t log out!!! the first days in Sao many people died or committed suicide cause they cannot manage to being trapped in a game! ..Even after lot of episodes in Log horizon people still don't care and live quietly.. ehm.. The real world? your family?don t you miss them? Sao s players started to fell \"adapted\" after a year or so when they partially left hopes for coming back in the real world. This is like a crucio that keeps knocking in your head and make this anime too illogical for a watch.Its pacing is also terrible and sets up many useless minor plots to the whole thing. \\n\r\nThen, the characters, the weakest point of LH:  the Mc, called the demonic four-eyed, a lv 90 magycian who uses only 1 spell for the few battles he fought (and he s lv 90 so a little more fantasy lol)..a ninja lolita who serve the mc like a master,wow what a news,a perverted big man who get kicked by the lolita every time he tries to joke, the leaders of the crescent moon, an hugger woman who hugs Everybody for no reason and the irrealistic business woman in the real world (bookkeeper i guess) that has a lv 90 Rpg player and spend all tje time trying to use the lolita like a doll..but ehi .. It s an anime so no problem,it s ok, should i continue? let s pass over, it s better..\\n\r\nThe most important, the death sistem.You can't die in the game.. Nope seriously? You just cut off the only thing that could have added some tension to this series.This fit up perfectly in Sao and that s why i absolutely loved the first 12 eps of it.The tension was constant and you didn t know what would have happened. \\n\r\nOne last thing, i read that after 50 eps so the end of the second season there are still no answers on WHAT and WHY they re there,which would have been the most important thing to explain, so no answers after 20 hours of watching lol.",

            "content": "When Log Horizon wasn't getting on my nerves it was putting me to sleep, it was sold to me as a fantasy world anime done right, with excellent world building, and a vast cast of interesting and likeable characters. Sadly I found this couldn't be further from the truth. \r\nThe first issue is that Log Horizon makes up its rules not on what logically makes sense, but what's convenient for its narrative. First of, in this fantasy world you can make food from a drop down menu or buy some made from an NPC, however these foods have no taste, now raw ingredients have taste,and so do meals made in the same way you would do so in the real world, though you need the chef subclass to do so. The reason why this is the case is never explained and is merely a contrivance to set up a major sub-plot early into the show. If the logic is that the menu made food doesn't have any taste because it goes through an \"unnatural\" creation process, why is NPC made food also effected by this. If you need the chef subclass to make food with flavor, why does everyone have the power to make food via a menu, also on that note why there is a chef class is never explained either and have a maid subclass come up later makes even less sense. \\n\\n\r\nEarly on we find out that all the characters take on the appearance of their in game avatars, Log Horizon really wanted to have it's cake and eat it too in this instance. All the low level players happen to be children, who all coincidentally made child avatars, which look similar to their real life selves, and everyone elses appearance match both their personality, and gender. Knowing this it would make a whole lot more sense if you simply took on your real life appearance, however then the show wouldn't have an excuse to have some players be cat people, who all coincidentally are fine with no longer being human and even love to role play twenty four seven. One could argue for suspension of disbelief here I agree, though it didn't need to be written in such a way. It could be that you take on your real life appearance, with the exception of specific non-human traits and it would of worked just fine. Even so these other races and traits never really add anything to the show and are never really explored, so I have to wonder what the point  was. \\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon isn't even consistent with its rules, it's established that if you attempt to fight inside a city, incredibly powerful guardians will spawn until you cease fighting, outside of cities you can kill other players however, they will merely infinitely re-spawn back in the city. It's also established that a guild exists that forces inexperienced players (who all happen to be children for some reason) to give their experience potions that they receive daily, to the high level players within said guild, of course this brings up just how exactly they could force them to do anything, considering they could just leave to the areas were the guardians spawn. The show attempts to explain this away by saying the guild members could simply kill them when they leave the city, though this implies they have enough people to keep the entire area covered for every time one of the children tries to leave, who are also totally okay with child abuse. At one point on of these guild members physically restrains one of the children, however the guardians don't spawn because it isn't technically 'combat', but this seems to imply that you could physically unarm someone and drag them out of the city, but not have the guardians spawn on you because you have technically started combat. This as well as the food having no taste and the physical appearance of the characters, are just three of the many issues I had with Log Horizons world building, as it feels as if the rules are made up merely as it goes along.\\n\\n\r\nAnnoyingly, Log Horizon doesn't even feel as if it accurately portrays MMO's how ether, in most of the battles only one or two ability is used per character, and  apparently there's no default attack for most of the classes.I cannot comprehend who would want to play an MMO in which you can only make one action every five teen or so seconds, it also doesn't help that we never learn the variety of class options or if there exists a form of meta game present before the game is made real.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the characters are a horrible detriment to the show, which all feel one note and completely uninteresting. We have our main character Shiroe, who doesn't really have much of a personality other than being somewhat reserved. The show wants us to believe he is a master strategist, apparently not by actually showing him do anything impressive but by having the characters constantly riding his dick about how great a strategist he is, remember don't show, tell tell and tell some more. Speaking of riding Shrioe's dick, what better way to describe Akatsuki, a 20 year old women with the appearance of a twelve year old (which is based off her actual appearance mind you) for some reason, not that it matters because she acts like a child, loving to constantly role play as her class, and refer to Shrio as her lord, it is unbearable as it sounds. She isn't the worst however as after her you have Naotsugu, his entire character is basically that he's a pervert, he exemplifies the worst of Log Horizon's attempt at humor, it wasn't funny when Akatsuki hit him the first time for being a pervert nor the other twenty times after that. Aside from that you have a group of annoying children who take several days to grasp the basic concepts of an MMO, some people who take things far too seriously, and a princess that everyone seems to love for no real reason. \\n\\n\r\nThe aesthetic of Log Horizon also feels uninspired, you'd think there would be some disquisition between high level and low level characters, considering that higher level players would have stronger equipment, but apparently not, you would also think people would look rather unique considering how much time people put into character customization but this isn't the case either. It makes it hard to wonder why people would play an MMO that looks so generic, and just because a narrative is based on an MMO it doesn't mean it has to conform to such a generic looking standard.\\n\\n\r\nI'll end on a positive note by saying the sound track for this show is decent, and also feels as if it would be in place inside of a video game, whilst also fitting the scene in general. The intro theme is also pretty good, aside from being a tad cringey with lines such as \"We've got the antidote for the jammed and hypnotized.\" Unfortunately this isn't enough to salvage Log Horizon, and I certainly wont be continuing on to season two.",

            "content": "Let me say this straight off the bat, this is not going to be an argument about why Log Horizon is better than Sword Art Online. It is going to be solely focused on the story of Log Horizon and how it is presented.\r\nOkay, let's first talk about the anime itself. The plot is every video gamer's dream and nightmare rolled into one, more on the side of the dream over the nightmare as there is (little) penalty for death unlike similar stories with this. The story plays out more like a fantasy genre anime than that of a video game, with some interesting developmentsthat make you think that it wasn't a game world but an entire fantasy universe that they were transported to (...I hope I didn't spoil anything unintentionally),\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about Log Horizon is that they drip feed you important pieces of lore about the anime world as a rate that makes you know the next big plot point without actually spoiling the surprise and impact that it has. Everything has a place within this universe (Chekhov's Gun at work) and nothing feels wasted.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is quite interesting. It has something about it that is unique while feeling similar as well. Sort of trying to create their own style of art while not going full blown unique like Zankyou no Terror or Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis (neither of which i had a problem with art wise). The art is pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is... again unique for lack of a better word. I like it, but it takes some getting used to. It is quite memorable and bizarre in a way that you just want to sing along. The backing music is also quite nice, with the main theme tune of the song used quite well throughout the anime. The only thing is the end theme. It's kinda forgettable, but it's still nice to listen to. It's what I've kinda come to expect of end themes, but it still surprised me that it was nice and hinted to a major plot point.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, let me just say that practically every five seconds of the opening animation is a massive spoiler, but they do it in such a way that you only realise after watching that part of the anime. Seriously, I thought Fairy Tail's OPs were good at that and then this happened.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to compare the characters to anything else it would be Code Geass. The reason is that, with the exception of the most minor of characters, all the characters are fleshed out in a way that you care about them. Even the characters who you originally find unlikable will make you care about them.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime a fair amount. I wouldn't absolutely binge watch it, but it constantly kept me intrigued. I'll say the last episode has the qualities of one of those, 'don't worry, we are making a second season so this will all make more sense' vibes to it, but at least there was a second season unlike other animes...\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a lighthearted anime to watch, but especially gamers.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, please, stop arguing over whether SAO or Log Horizon is better people. They are only connected by their genre, otherwise they are COMPLETELY different shows.",

And they were right. \r\nLets start with the story.\r\nWhile I cannot spoil anything, I will say that the story does take some time to get  going, and I can see why people get turned off by that. But to really see that greatness of this anime, you have to at least see 7 episodes. You then see how clever everything hangs together.\r\nThe world is also great. This is an MMORPG, and you really notice it. It actually has a lot of MMORPG elements in them,and the world cannot simply be traded with another fantasy world (which is one of my main complaints with Sword Art Online)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is lesser then in other anime's. Mostly with fight scenes, its very noticable. This could have been way better\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing about this anime are the characters. The characters are really build up, with multiple layers in their personality. Every character is different. (unlike in Sword Art Online)\\n\\n\r\nA thing that's also not that good, is the really cheesy humor. There is a lot of them. There were times that I really thought: ''why am I watching this?'' \\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT:\\n\\n\r\nEven though this anime has some problems (slow buildup, art style could be better, cheesy humor) the story is really good. None of the characters are alike, the world really feels like an MMORPG, and the show has really big payoffs. Really reccomend it\\n",

            "content": "Here goes yet another of my really dislikeable reviews... Yay! \r\nI\u00b4ll be honest with you, I was disappointed with this anime, quite a lot. Firstly, the premise is not much innovative, even though the way it was done was different than other animes of the sort (SAO, Accel World, etc.). My disappointment came from the fact that, even when not being a bad anime, I ended up waiting for something to happen for weeks in a row. It was something like \"Yeah! this time something WILL happen... Maybe?... Maybe not?... Perhaps next week!\". And the real problem is that I was expecting Log Horizon tobe an action anime or an adventure anime, when it all ended up being a Slice of Life. This could have been fine, if it weren't for so many chapters plagued with absolutely obvious facts, as if, rather than an anime, I was watching an MMO's beginners tutorial coupled up with \"Economics 101\".\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nI think I'm being very generous here for an anime I almost quit on over the exasperation of chapter after chapter of announcing somehting important happening that didn't even come up after all, summed up with those chapters where somehting DID happen, but it was made to be felt as tiny and unimportant as possible due to the 10 minute explanation of how a horde of trolls (goblins, whatever) is stronger than an unwalled village of puny townsmen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't compelling, but there were no uncomfing reductions in quality all throughout. There WERE times when it was noticeable how budget was saved by not showing talking mouths and so, but such things are acceptable, although at times it made it hard to tell whether the characters were talking out loud or thinking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nSound was decent. I liked the OP and the ED, but the overall soundtrack within the chapters was nothing to praise, as weren't the sound effects used through the course of the sreies.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I feel like I'm being too generous on this. Let it be like this, though. Characters were not impressive at all, not even the good kind of clich\u00e9. But what I found unstandable was the fact that EVERY SINGLE ONE of the characters HAD to do somehting that at the very least appeared important, as well as praising Shiroe for his \"brilliant\" ideas, as if he were Yagami Light or Lelouch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt's a seven just to be fair, and only because I've rated \"worse\" anime better than this on the enjoyment. It's not heartfelt, though, as, just the way I said, I was just about to drop LH by episode 20 or so (if I can recall it caorrectly).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4",

            "content": "First off, if you're trying to compare this show to Sword Art Online, just stop. They're both MMO fantasy settings, but the way they use that concept and the appeal they're trying to have is completely different.\r\nThat said, I loved this show. It's hard to explain simply, because when I say all the major plot points made sense, you'd think, \"gee, I'd hope so,\" but that really is a huge part of it. The show is constantly feeding you a steady supply of information that it presents as simple world building, but then they use that to resolve conflicts and it's incredible to watch. Themain character Shiroe actually feels smart in a relatable way because you have the same information he does and you can put it together with him (as opposed to the usual dumb way shows write smart characters of just pulling stuff out of nowhere and making it work).\\n\\n\r\nThe appeal of this show is just how it explores human psychology. Whether it's the effects of boredom on crime, economic stimulation on human happiness, politics, they cover it all simply but effectively and it's all interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThere were small things I didn't like, Henrietta's weird obsession with Akatsuki specifically grated on my nerves, but they were mixed in with so much interesting stuff I lived with this. I highly recommend everyone watch the first 2 arcs up to the formation of the Round Table, by then you'll know if the show works for you, but I loved it",

            "content": "All hail the anime gods and goddesses that Log Horizon was a double course anime because this anime both ended a year and started a year on a high note. Its amazing rendition of the video game player absorbtion genre (worst description ever?) brought back the true elements of a game-based anime. Please note that i am NOT comparing this to series such as .hack or SAO because Log Horizon is its own series and has created its own world, both literally and figuratively.\r\nBy this point, you should have read the synopsis far above and are really reading this review with the most common questionin your mind; \\n\r\n\"Do I watch this series or not?\". \\n\\n\r\nEasy answer.\\n\\n\r\nNo freaking s***.\\n\\n\r\nTheres a reason that in its few months of airing its practically in the top 200 and has a rating of 8/10 (at the time I write this review anyway). LH brings anything you can ask for: asskicking, romance, politics, friendship, beautiful artwork, stragedy, catchy music, character development, interesting storyline and a diversity of charismatic characters. Every episode in this anime has something interesting that will entertain you.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you read that long list and thought \"this is just going to be that gross milkshake thats a blend of everything and anything I saw in the fridge last night\", then don't worry. It might seem like a lot, but LH blends it all brilliantly together. From Shiroe thinking of battle and political stragedies, Marie being hilariously lazy, Nyanta-san being a swashbuckling cat or Akatsuki being the cute yet reliable ninja; this series will please you to no end. It even has a second season announced that will be coming this fall. That should be a blinking sign the size of a whale that its that good.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for those of you who do play strategic MMORPGs, this has something for you too. LH incorperates true-to-the-core game mechanics into its world. Shiroe is not powerful and respected for his brawn, but his brains and the way he manipulates the game to how he wishes it.\\n\\n\r\nSo what are you waiting for. Get off this review and haul yourself off to watch Log Horizon. You won't regret it. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously. Go do it. Now. You can thank me later.\\n\\n\r\n-Pironkon",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\r\nIn October of 2013 to the March of 2014 an anime was released, named Log Horizon. At first people took it for a mere clone of the .hack franchise and Sword Art Online, but what they didn't know, was that it was so much more.\r\nStory:- 7.8\r\nThe story of Log Horizon is nothing special or unique. It is basically what we have seen before in Sword Art Online and the .Hack franchise. People get stuck in a MMORPG video game, that\u2019s the most basic way to explain this type of show. But unlike other shows with this type of plot, in Log Horizon, ifour characters die in this game, they respawn like they would in a real video game. This changes everything drastically since now our characters will not die. The entire concept is now unique from other shows who have followed this \"stuck in a game\" route. \\n\\n\r\nThis allows the story to have a much less serious tone and thus allows for the viewer to have a good time with the anime. Instead of focusing on how to get out of the game, the anime focuses on how to adapt to the characters new \"home\".\\n\\n\r\nThe only negative point about the story is that is a bit formulaic and clich\u00e9 as well as the fact that for now the anime doesn't has no real or satisfying ending. But this can easily be fixed by the second season which comes out in the Fall of 2014. Another thing that this anime had in the negative side was the lack of much suspense. There were cliffhangers, but very few of them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:- 7.2\\n\r\nThe art and animation in the story was great while not being perfect. The scenery was good but nothing to write home about. The main focus, as one would expect, is the fights. But the flaw with this is that the fight scenes aren't focused on the actual fighting and the camera is usually focused on strategic aspects of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:- 7.0\\n\r\nThe sound of this anime is one of the lower points of the show. There aren\u2019t any really brilliant songs in the soundtrack. The opening song \u201cDatabase\u201d is a completely different beast altogether. It\u2019s a brilliant song which many will shun on their first listen but as the anime continues, the song will definitely grow on you and will possibly get stuck in your head. Not too fond of the rap section though.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime as of now doesn\u2019t have a dub and will probably not have one in the coming years, but the Japanese dub of the show is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack is merely average or at best good, the opening and ending are both very good, and the voice acting is good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:- 8.0\\n\r\nThe characters are the best part of this anime. Each character has a specific personality, including both the main and supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nShiroe is our main protagonist throughout the story. While seen as \u201cevil\u201d or \u201ccunning\u201d by the many people present in the game, but the people who are close to him know that he\u2019s a kind hearted person. To state his place in battles, you can call him a Tactician who doesn\u2019t lead the army, but passes strategic orders that help him and his friends to win in battle.\\n\\n\r\nNaotsugu is the stock \u201cbest friend pervert\u201d of the story. He\u2019s mainly used as a comic relief character, but in battle he is used in a much better way, being the \u201ctank\u201d of the group.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki can be described as a classic tsundere. Her character does gain depth throughout the story but not by much. There are many running gags with her like her actual age, and her kicking Naotsugu and later asking permission to do so from Shiroe. These gags do get stale very soon, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t get a few laughs from it. Her place in the battle is to kill opponents swiftly and gather information secretly as her class, assassin, allows her to do.\\n\\n\r\nThough the main characters are nothing brilliant on their own, what really makes the show shine is the gigantic list of supporting cast. Each and every side character has a backstory , and is overall well designed. The characters range from a flamboyant mage to a cat chef, and if I tried to define each character in detail, then I would be here for months.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5\\n\r\nIf you want to know whether Log Horizon is better than Sword Art Online or the .Hack franchise, then yes, it\u2019s much better.\\n\\n\r\nThe main attraction about the anime, is that it actually feels like a game with the respawning, NPCs, classes, shops, guild etc. While other anime that follow this concept feel much more \u201cserious\u201d, Log Horizon takes itself much less seriously. It knows what it is and doesn\u2019t try to act serious.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a light hearted anime with fun moments scattered throughout it, and decent action scenes when the action is actually shown.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I got a lot of fun out of Log Horizon, the story was nothing special , nor was the concept. But the execution of the concept is what really hits the ball out of the park. The characters are well designed, and each one has an intriguing personality, and is actually useful in the story. It\u2019s a simple story, but it has its own charm about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall=7.5\\n",

If you are into the kind of anime that has the MMORPG aspect to it, then you'll like this for sure.\r\nStory: 8\r\nWithout any spoilers, the plot develops and has different arcs in it. It has many different classes in the anime, hince being an MMORPG anime.\r\nArt: 8\r\nThe visuals are beautiful. I love how they did the artwork in this anime.\r\nSound: 10\r\nThe sound was perfect to say the least.\r\nCharacter: 9\r\nI enjoyed how thecharacters grew through the series, they were dynamic which made the anime even more fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nThere are different emotions throughout this anime but it was fun and I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, I enjoyed watching it. I always hear people saying Sword Art Online is better but you can't compare these two anime. That's like comparing an apple and an orange. You just can't do it. I would rewatch it. I thoroughly enjoyed it! I hope others find it as well!",

            "content": "The anime is very similar to Sword Art Online, and both have great sounds and music. However there are some upsides and downsides here and there:\r\nI liked the sense that Shiroe, a strategist and the protagonist of the story, uses tactics as a way to win fights more often than he use force. It adds more attractiveness and appreciation to the enjoyment of Log Horizon. (Shiroe + Ryouta Sakamoto, the protagonist of Btooom!, have similar ways on handing things; which is a thing I like in both animes)\r\nHowever, in Sword Art Online what kept players from returning back to real world is that Nerve Gear,the head piece technology used to play the game, was altered so that when a player dies he dies in real world too. But in Log Horizon, what makes players stay in the game? (unable to logout is not an enough reason to add sense to the story in my humble opinion). The series did not answer this question in its 1st season, but things might probably be more clear in the 2nd season to be aired next October.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching the anime especially the way the story builds up the way makes Log Horizon the kind of anime that you eager for the coming next episode to watch. Among animes aired on the same October 2013 season, Log Horizon is one of my recommended series. And, the ending theme song is spectacular!",

            "content": "The premise intrigued me and I was pretty much hooked from episode 1. This is an interesting show, not quite what I expected it to be from the early episodes going in. \r\nThose early episodes introduce our main characters and have them set out on quite an exciting quest. This is how I thought the show would pan out but it totally went against my expectations and for the next few episodes the show slowed down and had our characters discuss what their purpose was in this new reality. From there the show focuses more on politics and strategy than just action and adventure.\r\nThis isn'ta complaint, in fact I found it quite refreshing that the show would take such a mature approach to its subject. The show still has room for plenty of comic moments and our band of heroes are all likeable and relatable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good, shining especially during the action scenes. The music is also nice too (I loved the end theme and though the Japanese/English nu-metal opening makes me laugh, it got me pumped every time).\\n\\n\r\nI was pleased to hear there will be a second season. There's plenty of more the show can do and there is also room for improvement. If it's another full 25 episode season then I think the show could more fast paced. Plot-wise I'd liked to see more focus on the characters past lives in the real which the show barely touched on.\\n\\n\r\nSomething tells though that Log Horizon has set its sights high and overall this solid season gives me hope that the show will achieve epic things.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I watched this as a recommendation. I didn't expect much. And I was blown away. In many pieces.\r\nThis anime has a kick-ass theme song, great humor, amazing story, bad-ass MC, great and unique characters and I was hooked on fast. And I remained hooked until I watched it all. Can't say I liked season 2, but the first 25 episodes were superb. Some pointless filler here and there, but nothing too much to call it bad. \r\n\"The Villain in Glasses\" or Shiroe, is a main character presented in a different way. While still dense about intimacy, relationships and love - he is the superb tacticianthat everybody in the anime know. His reputation is scary even though he isn't a scary guy. But unlike in other anime where the MC is this dense brute going through endless ranks of enemies, proving how overpowered he is. Shiroe however is a strategist that stays in the shadows and unfolds his mad genius plans of anything that simply fall into place and leaves everyone with the jaws on the floor. That's his skill - his analytical planning and prediction. If Log Horizon was World of Warcraft, then Shiroe would be the support/healer type standing in the back of the fight, and giving instructions to a full 40 man raids.\\n\\n\r\nIMO Log Horizon beats SAO in their own game-like anime concept. Take this as my opinion, but Log Horizon is also what SAO wasn't. The story dwells on the entire world and goes to great lengths to explore the interactions between players and \"People of the Land\" or NPC's that are no longer just NPC's. There is a ton of lore, myths, flavor text and sheer lunacy of content that is about the world the characters are in. If I would compare them both now after I watched Log Horizon, I can safely assume that they did what SAO couldn't - an amazing exploration of the game world WITH the main characters in it. Not just another raid, another quest, another NPC that nobody would remember. My only regret is that there isn't any relationship that becomes \"public\". In that respect, SAO did better. Much better.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is magnificent. At least, the first season. \\n\r\nI HIGHLY recommend it to everyone. Especially those that liked SAO. You will be amazed by this one. I guarantee it.",

Also, the only reason why I started watching this show is because of SAO haters saying \"Log Horizon is better than SAO\". I wanted to give it a shot and so far, I was dissapointed.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nAfter watching 13 episodes, I was disappointed by the story... What exactly are these people doing? What's the goal? All I see is them creating a burger shop and trying to create a lawful world where players don't kill each other. I'm not going to go deeper intomy story review since the story synopsis is there for you. Another reason why I was dissapointed with the story is because it's very slow. Very slow to the point where I just fall asleep halfway through. I think I'm regretting what I said about SAO's fast story progression. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation is decent. It's not great and it's not bad either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10\\n\r\nIn order for the show to not be boring, you need to have a great soundtrack. Unfortunately, the show's soundtrack sucks. Especially, the opening soundtrack. It's some japanese guy singing in engrish and little but of japanese. The only good soundtrack I heard in this show is some battle themes and the ending soundtrack\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacrer 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters are pretty well designed and developed. They're pretty funny and I love how Atsuki and the Naotsu hate each others guts. Shiro is the main protagonist of the story. Atsuki and the Naotsu is the supporting characters. Shiro is your typical hero nerds, Atsuki is your typical emo character and a college girl who for whatever reason looks like a 7 year old girl, and Naotsu is your typical \"high school popular kid\" kind of guy. There's more characters but I'm not going to go deeper.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\r\nI didn't really enjoy the show. It's boring and there's not enough actions scenes. It has a very slow story progression and I pretty much gave up at Episode 13. I'm not going to watch anymore episodes because I'm done. I'm not sleeping or going to yawn  while watching an episode again\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\r\nIt's got a great story but everything else except the characters are lacking and boring. I don't see how this is better than SAO because it's not. In fact, I'm re watching the whole SAO Season 1 right now and I'm having a blast watching that show again. If you prefer a lot of talking and slow story progression then this is the show for you. If you prefer actions scenes and fast story progression then this is not a show for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\n-Funny characters\\n\r\n-Decent story\\n\r\n-Decent animation\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Crappy soundtrack\\n\r\n-Very slow progression\\n\r\n-Boring\\n\r\n-Good to watch if you desperately need a sleep",

The show was pretty interesting, when you go in when you're watching it keep in mind the aspects of the story isn't told mainly through the combat. The beginning of the show was a little slow, but still necessary to set up the environment and characters. The characters were written pretty nicely, they each had a personality that they stuck to all throughout the show. There wasn't that much character development, except for maybe afew characters. What makes the show pull through was how the characters handled their new environment, setting up laws and rebuilding a livable world. A few things I was pretty impressed with was the way the show explained functions and terms of a video game. So a viewer who doesn't play many games can go in and not be too confused. Another thing would be that they included NPCs (non playable characters) in the show. One thing I didn't like was how open the end was, it seemed like they left the show open for a third season. Sadly I don't think the show will have a third season.",

            "content": "Where to begin? After many months of procrastination I finally finished season 1 of Log Horizon, and it has left me with immense levels of satisfaction. I want to provide some background information, before leading into I feel about the show. I write my reviews in a unique style, I like to give things from my point of view and my opinions and experiences as they relate to me alone. Not how they should relate to everyone else. If you take the time to read this, use it as a basis for whether or not you may experience the same feelings, not whether or notI am a good gauge of whether you agree with my opinions. I am strictly stating how things are from my perspective. \\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t watched much Anime as you can see from my list, my first true favorite Anime was Bleach, which after awhile I grew sort of frustrated and tired with and have since put watching it on hold. Since introducing my wife to it, however, we are at a point where we should be able to start watching it again soon. \\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online was my first taste of the MMORPG Anime style of show. I got so lost in Sword Art Online and its love story that I thought no show could ever top the reminiscent feelings that show brought me. I hate to say it, but Log Horizon has very much so taken the cake. And it astonishes me to think that there are hundreds of other great Anime\u2019s out there of all different styles and stories that will amaze me. \\n\\n\r\nI spent the majority of my young adult life playing MMORPG\u2019s. I was a social outcast and had no friends, but MMO\u2019s were a place where that didn\u2019t matter and all that mattered was your ability to play well and interact well with others while doing so. I became one of the best tanks in my guilds and was always dependable for helping others. Some of my fondest memories are from my days playing various MMO\u2019s. Looking back on those days, I never really appreciated the fun and joy I was having like I can now that I am able to put things into perspective. I have never truly enjoyed games since my days of MMO\u2019s came to an end. The pure awe and experience gained through such massive community driven games has never been replicated in recent years for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept behind Log Horizon is on another level entirely. Although it\u2019s not an original idea in that players are trapped inside a digital world that can be perceived as reality, the show takes my imagination to a place it has not been in quite some time. It would almost be a dream come true for a game like Elder Tale to exist in it\u2019s entirety. Living in a world like that, through a sense of virtual reality but actually using your brain not just your hands and fingers, is something that I would probably never want to quit doing. \\n\\n\r\nThe show brings me powerful feelings of nostalgia that satiates my desire to return to MMO\u2019s immensely. It is very difficult to shake these feelings as it is quite overwhelming. On pure levels of enjoyment, this show brings it. I really get a sense that the creators know a lot about MMO\u2019s and what makes and drives them. The game is so relatable from the perspective of someone who has experienced it for many years.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the show is incredible, without giving anything away, the story feels exactly like it would feel if any MMO were real. The things that transpire and the way the world interacts is exactly as it is with any MMO. It\u2019s almost like a visual role-play, but if you\u2019ve played MMO\u2019s like I have, it feels so much more connected and real. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t find there to be much in the ways of music, or sound. There are small amounts of music and sound effects really, and that\u2019s ok. The visuals are quite stunning at times, and I find the overall animation, and creativity of the world to be quite good. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, I love all of the characters. I have found myself disliking very few characters throughout the entirety of the show. \\n\\n\r\nIn closing, this show is a must watch for anyone who misses the glory days of MMORPG\u2019s. I am not sure how this show would be perceived by someone with absolutely no knowledge of what an MMORPG is like, but can say that the story should be easy enough to follow that anyone can enjoy it. This has quickly become my favorite Anime so far of all of the few I have watched. I think a large contributor to that is how much I can relate to the subject material, the quality of the story and twists, as well as the quality of the premise behind the show. It\u2019s something that truly interests me and makes me excited to think about, which not much does anymore. I can only hope Season 2 carries on the greatness of Season 1, and if there is more to come after Season 2 it does the same. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot recommend watching this show enough, I find it to truly be one of the great works to be experienced in a persons lifetime. I have had so much fun binge watching Season 1. I cannot believe I ever procrastinated finishing this. I love Log Horizon!",

            "content": "Warning: this review contains mild spoilers.\r\nFirst impressions: \r\nSo, we got another show about people being trapped in a video game. Man, where have I heard that before?\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nLog Horizon is about a group of people who get mysteriously transported into the MMORPG known as Elder Tales, after they have the final DLC patch for it. With people now trapped in Elder Tales, it's up to the main character, Shiroe, to try to figure out what to do in this new world, and how to get home.\r\nYou can tell that this show has a very overused idea, that\u2019s been milked to death in recent years, withmost shows of its ilk being gamer-empowerment and otaku-pandering crap, that became boring and uninteresting after the first five-ish times this idea got put into practice. Suffice it to say, I didn\u2019t go into this show with high expectations. I must say, though, that upon watching Log Horizon, I was pleasantly surprised to see that presentation and execution of its basic idea was done pretty decently. Not only do they actually focus on the RPG elements and not just on beta males getting lots of pussy or Jesus-kun with hack powers, but they also actually focus on what would happen if you were trapped in your average MMORPG.\\n\r\nThe story line itself it's pretty interesting. While the idea of people being trapped in a video game is fairly standard, the idea of trying to establish a basic government and build a community is extremely unconventional. As a bonus, the idea of not having much interest in escaping the game and returning to their (presumably crappy) lives, but rather staying in the game and making the best of it, is a nice touch. The story and presentation were handled quite well, especially in regard to the sociopolitics between the different guilds and the game\u2019s NPCs, and the psychological issues that may arise from being transported to the game world, after all the initial dust has settled. Another thing that really helped sell the story\u2019s believability as a whole is the way the cast treat the former game as their new reality, especially regarding how they try to solve the problems that plague their new society, as you\u2019d imagine people would in real life. One of the most memorable incidents of something like this happening being the extermination of a faction that practiced slavery and extortion against lower level players. \\n\r\nPerhaps one of the fascinating aspects of Log Horizon is the way it deals with the idea of characters\u2019 purpose for living. One of the big problems early in the series is the general public\u2019s boredom and lack of motivation to do anything, as they don\u2019t really have anything to live for or do. This problem is only heightened by the fact that all they have to do to live in the game world is kill a few entry level monsters for gold coins, and use that gold to pay for a inn and food. As a result, due to the lack of structure, to absotutely nobody\u2019s shock, a lot people start destroying shit and killing other players, with next-to-no consequences, with death being a non-issue.\\n\r\nNow a few negatives I. One of the primary factors that prevented me from enjoying the show was the significant lack of tension, especially that resulting from the more prominent character\u2019s immortality, rendering the concept of death semi-meaningless. This problem I have with the show is slightly alleviated by the fact that characters lose some of their memories when they die, but not much. Unfortunately, since this mechanism never gets put to any use, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t really serve any purpose other than to create artificial tension. Another problem I have with Log Horizon is that even though there are tactics involved, there are some parts where the main characters, particularly Shiroe, pull solutions to problems straight out of their asses, under the guise of experience. Because of this, a lot of the encounters felt very one-sided and the feeling of tension was undercut for me even more than with just the previous problem, and it took away from the experience quite a bit. Something that I\u2019m kind of on the fence about is the fact that there are a few romantic moments between some of the characters. While they don\u2019t exactly feel unnatural and I don't find them too bad, they just don't seem to go anywhere, and I feel that they don't add much to the character or story, anyway. The final negative is that it feels like you would have to be a gamer to fully enjoy it, limiting it\u2019s accessibility. Other than that, Log Horizon is pretty much a slice of life trapped in a video game with romcom elements and good pacing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nThe main character, Shiroe(real name Kei Shirogane), was somewhat interesting to me. His strategist appeal, as well as his use of the ruthless tactics that earned him the nickname \u201cthe villain behind the glasses\u201d, being more than enough to prompt the growth of my initial interest. My favourite display of this trait is probably when he purchases the main hall, where both the bank and a lot of the local guild's\u2019 headquarters are, and strongarms the local guild leaders into conforming to his plan, and forming a government, or else. This action speaks volumes about his character, as it not only displays his level of cunning and tact, but also how meticulous he can be when pulling off a plan on that scale. In fact, this plan is highly reminiscent of something you would find in Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's book \u2018The Prince\u2019, so props for that. Despite the machiavellian schemer front he puts on though, it\u2019s been shown that Shiroe has the best intentions in mind with every action he takes, and just doesn\u2019t care about the way he\u2019s perceived by the general public. Besides which, while he may have a somewhat antisocial and reclusive exterior, he\u2019s surprisingly kind to those that he\u2019s close to. My favourite part of the story, where this aspect of his personality is highlighted, is probably when he takes them time to assume a mentor role for some of the community\u2019s younger low-level players, as he not only goes out of his way to protect them, but also takes the time to teach them to defend themselves. This showcases that he does actually have some people skills, even if he mostly prefers to work by himself, but can also have actual comrades that he legitimately cares for.\\n\r\nThe side characters are two-dimensional, at best. Some of the series\u2019 ever so lovably trophy characters include the goofball, the tsundere and the gentlemen badass. You can easily tell how stereotypical they are because of how little they deviate from their stereotypes, with the exception of how good they are at being them. However, even though the characters are so cliched, they actually have some pretty fun character interactions, and have their own role to play in the grand scheme of things. It\u2019s made abundantly clear that this isn't just your lord and savior jesus-kun type of character doing almost everything, and the vast majority of the rest of the cast doing absolutely nothing (other that looking pretty, that is) type of story. Every character, and I mean EVERY character, plays some sort of part in the story, and it doesn't come off as disjointed, like a lot of series with such a big cast do, but rather, very organic. The major problem with the side characters, though, is that not all of them get the necessary amount of screen time to flesh them out. This not only stretches the narrative too thin, but also makes the characters kinda suffer a result. Suffice it to say, though, most of the characters are more than fun and cool enough for that not to be a major problem. Their ample amount of energy and personality also really helps gloss over the aforementioned problem. Unfortunately, there are a few character arcs that are still in progress, so while they may go somewhere in the light novels, as it stands, a sizable proportion of the cast ramain lukewarm and undercooked.\\n\r\nSide note: I found a decent number of the characters relatable, in some way or form, as  quite a few of them remind me either myself or people I know in real life, which I find pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe animation was, for the most part, fine. The backgrounds were alright, but nothing really to write home about, as more often than not  they\u2019d look unfocused and sometimes even kinda fuzzy, with there only being a few shots in the entire show that looked decent. They\u2019d have these very bright color schemes, which looked nice and all, but were kinda an eyesore at times and could have used some dimming down. The character designs were pretty basic and definitely inferior to the standard for anime of this genre. The most underwhelming thing about the designs being how lacking they were in the cool factor that you\u2019d expect from videos game avatars, specially for the high level characters the show mostly focuses on. I was kinda expecting their outfits or tools to look cooler and more detailed, when compared to everyone under level 50, as in RPGs you generally get better and cooler looking gear the more you level up, but nope, none of that here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nI found the opening and ending songs really annoying at first, but after a while, they kind of grew on me a bit, growing on me so much that now I have both songs downloaded on my PC. Other than that, though, the OST is kind of bland and generic at times, even if it fits with what's going on. (The OST was done by Yasuharu Takanashi.) As for the dub and sub, they were descent, with Nyanta\u2019s dub and sub voice actors being exceptional, as they both do a very good job of capturing the character\u2019s mature, swagger, gentleman badass appeal.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThere were a few things I liked about this show, mostly revolving around the way they tap into some of the potential that this kind of setting can have. I liked the political dealings, the more comedic moments and also the fact that every character has their role to play in the newly formed community. I admit, though, that I also like it for the simple reason that it takes place in a video game and I happen to be a massive RPG fag.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a trapped in a video game anime that isn't just otaku-pandering and gamer-empowerment, and are satisfied with the kiddie-pool level of psychology, politics and social issues that the show presents, then Log Horizon is definitely for you. However, if you\u2019ve experienced a lot of the tropes typically used in this type of show and you're not into video games, then Log Horizon will probably become a tedious watch very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial thanks to my paid in Yu-gi-oh cards script editor, Lonecrit.\\n",

One tanky dude screams \"Anchor Howl\" and it's just a flash of a green light that is supposed to draw the enemies towards him. I know it's supposed to be like in a video game but that doesn't really translate well to animation. \r\nThe general premise iskind of dumb. Due to how the world works everything the heroes do seems kind of pointless. There's no end goal nor any danger, it's literally \"lol we're in a video game now\". Hell, the main hero even says \"there's no point in doing anything\" in the very first episode. If there's no point - why keep on watching?",

I haven't finished the second season, but what I've seen of it addresses a number of my issues with the first and I would rate it at least a point higher.)\r\nLog Horizon is a show that can't escape comparisons to Sword Art Online. And I get why; they have similar set ups but LH takes a much more grounded and realistic approach to MMO design in many of the ways that SAO trolls big fans of the genre. It certainly deserves praise for that, if that's your kind of thing; the game mechanics and culture ofMMOs are well-depicted from what I understand of them, and have occasional clever impacts on the plot. However, in my opinion many of the other aspects of the show are mediocre to the extent that it ends up being merely an okay package, at least to someone like me who has played casually but never really been engrossed in a real MMO. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bag. Shiroe is an interesting subversion of the typical sort of protagonist you'd expect in a show like this, being a brainy tactician who lets others do the more direct fighting, and he's a reasonably interesting character beyond that as well. There are also a few others I found pretty inspired, like Krusty and Raynesia, who have a great dynamic that feels very human despite one of them being the world's equivalent of an NPC. However, I found much of the cast pretty boring and somewhat stereotypical a lot of the time, and rarely very developed. The visual designs are also kind of mediocre in my opinion; they're not terrible but there were very few characters I looked at and immediately thought \"I want to know what's going on here\" or \"that guy looks awesome\". They're serviceable on average but rarely great. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is in kind of a similar place. There was one arc I thought really stood out, with a surprising revelation about one character and subsequent action around it, but otherwise I found the conflicts pretty dull. The one thing about the show I would give unadulterated praise is the OP, which is a damn good song that really gets you hyped for the show and probably kept me a lot more invested than I would have been otherwise. Ultimately, there were a few things I really liked about Log Horizon, but I thought it was frequently mediocre and didn't always hold my interest. 6/10.",

            "content": "Log Horizon is a slow paced, character driven \"trapped in a video game\" anime that I think will be really hit or miss for most people. For some, I think the slow pace and relative infrequency of combat scenes will be a big turn off whereas other more patient watchers who get genuinely into characters and their backstories will find a lot to enjoy here.\r\nArt-\r\nLog Horizon is a relatively recent and modern anime and in my opinion never looks dated at all. The animation is crisp and clean and all the main characters (and there are A LOT of them) look nothing alike and havetheir own unique and easily identifiable features, clothing preferences, etc.\\n\\n\r\nA subtle touch that I quite liked was the \"halfway through this episode\" screens, where they'd feature a plethora of characters, usually someone relevant to that particular episode, in an adorable miniaturized form. Log Horizon is seldom flashy but that's not from a lack of budget or quality- it's simply not the direction they chose to go with the animation style.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack here is rock solid. It's not at Yuki Kajiura level where the soundtrack is so unbelievably good one could argue it's better than any other aspect of the show, but you're looking at a consistent, scene appropriate, energetic, varied soundtrack here with a couple genuine standouts that I'd listen to after the show has concluded. I'd describe the soundtrack as being on the high end of \"very good\"- considerably better than \"good\" but just a baby step worse than \"great\".\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is solid with no poor performances or characters whose voices simply do not fit the rest of the character, so no huge gripes here. However, one or two of the younger characters, arguably, have annoying voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\\n\r\nOne of the quirks of Log Horizon, for better or worse, is there are A LOT of characters and almost all of them are relatively important in some way. There is a clear main character and in my opinion a clear 2nd and 3rd character in the pecking order, but this is one of those shows, unlike many, where whoever the 15th most important character is, they're genuinely important to the story and not just for one or two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nShockingly, and this is one of the show's absolute biggest strengths and points of praise, despite having an extremely large cast of named, important characters the show somehow manages to truly develop damn near all of them and give everybody screen time. This is extremely difficult to do and I've critiqued many other shows in my previous reviews for coming up short in this department, but Log Horizon, somehow, despite a much bigger cast than most anime pulls it off very well.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, with so many characters to develop and with this being a heavily character and story driven anime, the pace throughout is simply slow. I'd not say this anime (in Season 1 anyway...) has pacing ISSUES per say- in fact, I'd say the pace is pretty much the same from start to finish and that pace is slow. I didn't mind this, and I loved how developed the characters became, but I can see younger or less patient viewers not caring for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself- trapped in a video game- isn't anything new, but the world building here is superb and arguably the strongest point of the entire show. Game/world mechanics are explained clearly and in great detail, backstories of the world itself and its inhabitants are visited often and I never found myself asking how or why something was happening as the show is very aware that there are non MMO players/non gamers watching it makes a point to explain what's going on and how it works.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nWith any slow paced anime there will inevitably be a couple not particularly exciting moments and that's true here as well, but it never felt dull or like I could fall asleep from my boredom. I enjoyed the character development, I cared about the relationships built between characters and when I finished Season 1 I was very much ready to jump right in and watch Season 2. I never felt like I was on the edge of my seat and absolutely had to watch the next episode and see what happens the way I have in the past with anime like Death Note or Psycho Pass, but I was slowly, consistently enjoying myself throughout my viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nA slow and steady character driven ride that a patient viewer will appreciate, Log Horizon isn't an all time great, but it's one of those shows where it's never bad and never amazing- merely consistently good to very good throughout- and I enjoyed the ride. \\n\\n\r\n+Deep character development spread across a very large cast\\n\r\n+Exceptionally good world building\\n\r\n+Consistent in every way\\n\r\n+Never, at any point, mediocre or worse\\n\\n\r\n-A few slower, borderline boring stretches\\n\r\n-The characters carry the story- the story itself isn't anything special\\n\r\n-Never, at any point, truly great or better\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 8\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 8",

Its animation and inconsistencies with certain characters and scenes made it look sloppy. But what was really strong about this show is how in depth the world is and how the characters in the show take advantage of the whole \"in another world\" situation. Log Horizon's approach to the \"trapped in a video game\"\r\nI would give this anime a higher score but the romantic subplots tended to slow down the show. Although comedic scenes lightened up the mood, they felt out of placeand poorly executed (also the jokes were the same it got old quickly) Basically what I'm trying to say is, the characters aren't really that interesting. Each character is very one note except for the main character, Shiroe. \\n\r\nShiroe is by far the most interesting character to watch. Not knowing what exactly he'll do next and seeing everything unfold according to his plans makes Log Horizon fun and engaging.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 for being an enjoyable show to watch but points lost for boring romantic subplot and flat comedy.",

All to be engulfed in the flame of insatiable love interest.

            "content": "Living in the Database.\r\nThe story is a basic stuck in a video game premise. Instead of desperately trying to escape and survive the game, characters make the most of their surroundings. Death isn't permanent and life is pretty chill. Which means the story can focus on the players relationships with each other, the NPC's, and the nature of the world of Elder Tale. The story however does suffer from a bit of a pacing problem. The ending felt like it was dragged on. I think the show would have done better if it ended before the scale festival arc. Additionally, I found it kinda oddthat the first season ended with a small build up to the already announced season 2.  \\n\\n\r\nSatelite does a pretty good job with the art. Looks like a game with a bunch of comic relief moments. Nothing damning or spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nSound is pretty good. Solid opening and ending. BGM is fine as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are a huge part of the show. Got lots of rotating characters, which means they move in and out of situations as needed or called on. Screen time is divided pretty evenly between major and minor characters. Having so many characters generally means that we don't get to see them all developed. Most characters have a recurring gimmick or two and little else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is fairly high. Log Horizon manages to make and solve a fair amount of problems in 25 episodes. They addressed several interesting issues that players would have in a game and added some social aspects too. Action is a bit lacking, but this isn't a very big deal. Surprise! The main character is a support class. Also, several dangerously furry romances. One involving a khajit and a young girl.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a good show. If you like video games, specifically MMORPGs, give this a try. It might change your perception of game worlds and yourself as a player.",

Log Horizon was able to keep a usually dramatic topic and keep the story upbeat and intriguing throughout. The series has strong characters, although there isn't a lot of character growth throughout the series. Besides the lack of character growth, there are also a few episodes where pacing felt a bit off. The story progressed very nicely despite the minor pacing issues, and the series showed an ample amount of the main and side characters. This focus gave the show a sense of \"fullness\" that I greatly enjoyed. I personally havenot watched the Japanese dub, but I thought the English dub actors for their characters quite nicely. The art was nice to look at and it impressed me. Overall, I greatly enjoyed Log Horizon because of its story, characters, and overall tone.",

            "content": "I'm actually kinda surprised at how high this show has been rated. But to be fair, everyone has their own taste in anime. \r\nThis was not mine. I was actually pretty hyped up to watch it after reading the reviews. But I'm looking back and wondering how I finished these 25 episodes. \r\nMy biggest issue with this anime was it has this 'spark' that promised to bloom into something more. But until the end I was waiting and waiting for it to go off.\r\nCharacters: \r\nShiroe is the loner genius that relearns the bonds of friendship. He is not a fighter but a strategist. Thing isI really didn't see Shiroe as any kind of genius but rather a good politician and businessman.  It is more of a 'oh he thought of it first' kinda of genuis. That or when he does solve the problem, it is with such vague logic you wonder how it even came through. When you take that out of the equation all Shiroe really has as an advantage is that he is a senior player and has the items and experience necessary to navigate through certain situations. That said, he isn't a bad main character because I like how he isn't the hero filled with purpose and drive but more of a character that rides his own flow and intersects with the main river to keep it from dying out. It made it interesting to see how he would deal with every situation. \\n\\n\r\nRomance/Female Characters\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe romance irritated me to no end. The main love interests look like 12 year old girls. One actually is a 12 year old girl. The rest were represented by huge breasts and outlandish personalities that removed them from the possibility of being love interest. They were hilarious and endearing in their own way but they were more for comedic effect than anything. \\n\\n\r\nI really really really liked Akatsuki and wouldn't even mind her love for Shiroe if it didn't completely limit her. We see her fight once or twice in the first 5 episodes and despite being one of the strongest characters she is not seen fighting again. Ever. \\n\\n\r\nAction/Fighting:\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting was non-existent, funnily enough for a video game. The issue is that every 4 or 5 episodes there would be a situation where a fight is happening but the fight itself was just lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nIt started off good - the first 10 episodes were at least decent. But slowly it just stopped.  They scene barely last 5 mins, the same spells are used, and in the case of the 'major event' later on we don't even actually see combat despite the situation. We get a full frontal shot of the character getting ready but no actually movement. Only colorful lights being thrown everywhere. It was disappointing to watch because the animation was there and the potential to have at least one good battle is part of the fact I kept watching. Sadly, that never happened. \\n\\n\r\nSo what's left? : \\n\\n\r\nMajority of the story is set in world building - politics, government, security, and public calm. We see small things like teaching, festivals, fast food and other nuances of our world being put back into the video world. The more they try to do that, the less of the 'video game' feeling we are left with towards the end of the season. The last 'battle' perfectly exemplifies this. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is the only thing I would give this show a 8/9 for. It's what kept me going. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I am not going to watch season 2. Would I recommend this anime, not really. However, if you know what you like, maybe you might find something to connect you to Log Horizon. I couldn't find much.",

If you liked SAO You'll probably like LH. Between the two shows I prefer LH - This is based mostly on character complexity and storycomplexity. I felt the characters were more diverse in LH, while the story progressed faster, was more complex and less predictable.

            "content": "In a world of shitty isekai's, there's gotta be one that's actually good, right? Log Horizon is... not quite that. \r\nLog Horizon is a series that, while not that good, does have a few things going for it. Notably, the strength of the narrative and its use of MMORPG mechanics as plot devices. However, these advantages are smeared by a mess of poor presentation and stiff characters. I can see why somebody could be captivated by a show like this, but so many elements hold it back from being anything beyond but just-another-isekai.\r\n[Rating]\r\nStory: 8 \r\nArt: 3\r\nSound: 4\r\nCharacter: 3\r\nEnjoyment: 5\r\nOverall: 4\r\n[Story: 8]\r\nThe story is, without adoubt, really well constructed. That is, until the final arc. But let's list what is great about the story at the start!\\n\\n\r\n- Shifts in the plot don't feel random due to proper foreshadowing.\\n\r\n- Offers perspective on both high-level and low-level players\\n\r\n- Uses MMORPG elements properly as plot devices.\\n\r\n- Keeps audience informed about the rules of the world.\\n\r\n- Great understanding of political and economic response to social change.\\n\r\n- Has a pretty good sense of agency and pace. \\n\r\n- Gives opportunity for growth to many characters in a way that feels natural (though the characters are too weak to support it)\\n\\n\r\n... and more. I would nearly give the plot a 10... before we get to the last chunk of episodes. Coming in, we finish a nice battle arc but don't really settle the 'final boss', which the audience definitely expects. Instead, we go into this strange romance arc which is incredibly boring because THE COUPLES SUCK and also this strange scheme-discovery arc which is also weird because all it really does is set up the next season. This really makes the last 7 or so episodes lack any real sort of interest when it makes the most sense to just finish off the action and set up these events better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 3]\\n\r\nThe art is not good. Generally, things look alright, but the line art and character portraits are really iffy most of the time. Character design ranges from average to poor, the only good one appears in the last episode. It also feels like the characters simply lack proper shading. Art of the various monsters is awful. Really lacking in the action department.\\n\\n\r\nI'm taking a full point off for the egregious use of the glasses-adjust visual device. Happens so often. It is beyond stupid. Whoever thought this was a good idea should never be allowed to work in the industry again. Seriously, what are you doing? \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 4]\\n\r\nVoice acting is pretty stiff. Individual tracks and simple and do the job, but definitely repetitive. Otherwise, the sound design is fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 3]\\n\r\nYeah I mean, these characters really don't have much going on. Shiroe and Minori have some moments going for them, but beyond that, the rest are just throwaways. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is particularly maligned by its inability to properly construct a romance, which it tries to do. Get Akatsuki out of the show. She literally did nothing after episode 5 in this series. She has no romance potential at all. What are you doing?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 5]\\n\r\nI finished it! The story keeps you engaged without the continuous use of cliffhangers, which is a testament to the strength of the narrative with all the other problems that exist in the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 4]\\n\r\nNothing left to say. Despite the strength of the narrative, I consider this to be a close-to-average show. That being said, those interesting in storytelling can learn a great deal from this series. But there is too much holding it back from being actually good.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is starts as one of the worst attempts at pandering to mmo crowd I've ever seen, but slowly manages to pull itself together and provide something somewhat original and interesting in the end. In the end it is a mix of good and bad. At the \"bad\" side there are numerous cringe-worthy poorly moments where the game tried to throw MMO slang around or (even worse) explain it. At the \"good\" side... we have numerous story moments where the anime drops obsession with MMO thing, and starts focusing on the story and characters. In the end both sides sorta cancel each other out,and result is somewhere in the middle. I would say it is slightly better than first season of Overlord, all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10:\\n\r\nFirst episodes are horrible. First means somewhere between 4 and 8 of the first episodes. The anime makes a point of throwing around terminology related to online games and at the same time it wastes many many many scenes explaining MMO mechanics. It is cringeworthy and silly. The only reason why I pulled through those beginning episodes is one of the likeable secondary characters, which made the whole thing interesting. However, past certain point it stops trying to explain everything, and tunes down the number of MMO slang thrown around, and concentrates on unique aspects of the world ... it becomes much more interesting. At the same time the anime introduces a very likeable and very well done secondary character that saves the day. That helps as well.\\n\\n\r\nExpect ton of MMO reference and slang fan-service from the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10:\\n\r\nHonestly, nothing to write home about. The anime uses plenty of adult-proportioned characters, which is good, but it uses that style where linework is often abbreviated, and level of details is somewhat low, which is a bit disappointing. Backgrounds are well done, but I wish characters had more details. Still, there are a lot of large scenes with a lot of people, prerhaps that was the reason for slightly simpler art style. Either way, the visuals didn't make me go wow.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10:\\n\r\nThe music its job, pretty much, and there's little to tell about it. Most of the voice actors are okay, however, sider heroines I mentioned stood out as being more convincing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10:\\n\r\nNow, here we have a split and mix of good and bad. Majority of characters in the anime are quite bland. They're either \"carton cutouts\", or highly stereotypical. Which is not a good thing. For example, after completing the season I have very little to say about protagonist's character.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are two side characters that are of significantly higher quality, compared to everybody else. The first one is Akatsuki, and the second one is certain Princess. The princess is absolutely adorable to watch, and pretty much saves the day, in terms of quality. Her performance outshines most of the other characters, and she is both more believable and more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10:\\n\r\nIt was mostly okay. I could barely tolerate first episodes, but later found some fun watching scenes related to akatsuki and the princess. Those redeemed this anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line: 5/10:\\n\r\nIt is a mix of good and bad. The anime wastes too much time trying to appeal to MMO crowd, and for someone who isn't into the genre this can be annoying. Same applies to situations where MMO mechanics are being explained.\\n\\n\r\nHowever. in the middle of the season there are more interesting developments in the world, and there are two very well done characters which pretty much save the show in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo.... my advice is: it may be worth checking out, but non-MMO people can find pandering to MMO players in the first episodes to eb both annoying and distracting. The show gets much better in the middle, and have two very amusing/amazing characters, which are pretty much the primary reason for watching it till the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo, it is worth checking out - mostly because of those two well done characters I mentioned, and because of unique setting explanation.... - but I wouldn't call it a \"must have\" kind of anime.",

            "content": "Remember that time when you watched an anime that just put a big smile on your face?\r\n Log Horizon is not for everyone. When I compare it to my other favorite anime, I see that it is a lot more...simple. There really isn't a definitive conflict for the majority of the series, and the characters get a lot of time to sit back and relax. The primary focus of this anime is building the world in which the characters live in. It may not be super thrilling, but depending on your taste, it can be super engaging. \r\n I was recommended this anime from oneof my MAL friends who was well aware of my disdain for SAO. Most of them are. (And if you'd like to know more about that, read my SAO review!) The reason why the two shows are comparative is that they both feature a premise where the characters are stuck in a video game. Fortunately, the similarities stop there. \\n\\n\r\n At the start of the show, three questions pop into the viewer's mind:\\n\r\n 1. Why are these people trapped in a game?\\n\r\n 2. How did these people get trapped in a game?\\n\r\n 3. How do these people un-trap themselves? \\n\r\n Unfortunately, you'll be asking these questions for a while, and so will the characters.\\n\\n\r\n Speaking of the characters, we have our main protagonist, Shiroe! Shiroe is to a small extant an antihero, although he always has the common good in mind. However, his sometimes questionable means of attaining said good has dubbed him the name of \"The Villain Behind Glasses.\" Unlike the in-your-face, front-line-fighting main characters that are in shows like SAO and Attack on Titan, Shiroe does his job from behind the scenes. Even in the few fights he participates in, he plays the role of support. While being both smart and powerful, Shiroe is not perfect. Most of his prowess is dependent on his friends and allies. \\n\\n\r\n Aside from our main man Shiroe, there are many other cast members. Despite the size of the cast, I was very impressed by the likability of the characters. Lots of people get plenty of time in the spotlight, while others get just enough. Some of the personalities may be a bit cookie cutter. We have the bubbly girl, the pervert guy, the emo, the badass, and some loveable kids, but they still are all great characters. And that's just scratching the service; there are many more faces to see. \\n\\n\r\n Now, back to the story. It\u2019s not that I liked the premise of being trapped in a video game, but rather the way it was executed. Remember, the characters have absolutely no idea what is going on except for the obvious. So what do they do? They live! That's pretty much it. They spend less time worrying about the unknown and focus on what's in front of them. They set foundations for society (government, economics), they make innovations in industry, and they establish relationships with the people of the land. And the people of the land are NPC's. Yes, what would be considered just worthless programs now suddenly become real people with real lives and real feelings. It turns out that it is not the NPC's that are strangers in this world, but rather the players. \\n\\n\r\n World building in Log Horizon goes above and beyond what one might expect. Not only is the actual setting developed, but lots of time is spent to keep us in the loop about these people being in a video game. For example, in an arc where novice players train to become more experienced, the characters are tasked with coordinating with each other in battle. Roles are assigned based on their respective classes (mage, samurai, etc.), and they have to learn the mechanics of their respective skills and spells. And its not only during battles when we get this kind of depth. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple a person having to be the one that makes dinner because he's the one with the cooking skill. \\n\\n\r\n The last thing that needs going over is the anime's music and animation. As far as a soundtrack goes, there wasn't any song that I found too memorable. Still, as long as I don't find the audio to be a burden, I am very lenient. At first I thought the animation was somewhat average, but it has its moments. Sometimes enemies are animated in 3D, and the user interface the players use stands out. I never felt suspicious that the animators were cutting back or anything. And besides, no matter how good you make an anime look, it can't turn it from bad too good. (*cough* SAO *cough*) \\n\\n\r\n Enjoying this anime as much as I did was kind of bitter sweet. Knowing that the story takes a turn for the worst in its second season brings me down. Still, as soon as a third season is announced, I'll watch it. And besides, Log Horizon doesn't end on a note that is unsatisfying. Sure, questions have yet to be answered, but it is still a great experience. Giving it 9/10 should be testament to my overall enjoyment. Log Horizon is not overly dramatic, nor is it edge-of-your-seat thrilling, but quality entertainment is quality entertainment. \\n\\n\r\n *Edit\\n\r\n After re-watching Log Horizon, I think it is a lot more thrilling than I make it out to be in this review. It would probably be more appropriate to say it\u2019s not ALWAYS thrilling. There are certainly some edge-of-your-seat moments.\\n\\n\r\n Once again, Log Horizon is probably not for everyone. Anyone looking for groundbreaking effects and a super complex plot will be disappointed. Still, the antics on the screen are bound to put a smile on your face, as it did for me many times.\\n",

It's not SAO 2.1\r\nLog Horizon, so.... thousands of player trapped in a MMORPG called Elder Tale. SAO is the same thing but, instead of showing how badass our MC is, Log Horizon took a drastic turn and make our MC weak as hell to the point where his attack couldn't do anything against an enemy without help. You may think \"What the hell, man! It's lame. We want to see some action and power and shit. Not a lameass MC\". Well, I'll tell you this. For a lack of power, our MC does have a strategical mind. He's able to assess a battle from the sidelines. Also, they take their sweet time to explain the game mechanic and lore to the watcher (Unlike in SAO, where in episode 2, they just time-skip everything. Leaving you clueless) while keeping the paces of the story on the good track. The story doesn't really rely on action that much. Its focus are the politics and strategic mastermind (Believe me, it's not going to be boring. You'll actually enjoy it) The characters are lovable and the supporting cast do develop to the point where they are the main cast. The voice actings are good and the OP are the best in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoy this. I didn't hate SAO, I like it but Log Horizon steals the spotlight from SAO",

            "content": "I'll keep it Simple & Clean: This Anime is a \"Diamond in the Rough.\"\r\nBased on the first episode, the story, characters, and dialogue would all have you believing that Log Horizon will be just another \"trapped-in-game\" rehash of \".Hack\" or \"Sword Art Online.\"  You know, the typical \"popular VR game somehow glitches and people become trapped within\" clich\u00e9.  If you believed that's what it is, you wouldn't be wrong, but it's so much more.  Chip away the obvious similarities in motif and you'll find a unique gem.\r\nThis show, unlike it's predecessors, focuses more on the economics & politics of a reality whereyou can't escape a virtual MMORPG.  Now that may sound like a bore, but meditate on that idea seriously before deciding.  Look at the real world we live in today and reflect on how crazy things are and how they got that way.  Now, apply that to a magical world of \"Might & Mana\" where there is no \"opting out\" option; death in-game simply sends you the nearest temple to be revived.  What would you do?  What could you do?  Log Horizon explores these ideas but does it with a levity that allows for all the fun of a traditional shounen; similar in tone to \"Fairy Tail\" or \"Soul Eater.\"  I don't say this as a negative but as an observation.  Personally I'd enjoy this a lot more with a Seinen feel but I was satisfied with it as is.\\n\\n\r\nI am under the understanding that the show will be returning for a 2nd season later this year.  I welcome this because honestly, this season ended horribly.  The final few episodes compared to what was happening prior to them, almost seemed like a completely different show.  Maybe they weren't sure if the show would go past 25 episodes so just mashed together some random plots to not end on a major cliffhanger.  Having said all that, give this one a try; the worst you'd think is it's just okay.",

One day, 10000 player trapped in a world similar to that game..\"\r\nIt begins with a man with glasses named Shiroe which trapped into the game he played \"Elder Tale\".. The story flows with him strategically providing solutions and plans to the situations he faced. Log horizon itself also tells the concept details of the game excellently so even if you're not a gamer you will most likely understands what just happened..\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 :\\n\r\n\"Doesn't breathtaking, but doesn't sting the eye..\"\\n\r\nIn art, apparently Log Horizon doesn't provide much competition to their \"trapped-in-video-game\" Anime rivals. But hey, the armor design looks realistic because its clearly without cleavage.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 :\\n\r\n\"Varied person, equal role into one goals..\"\\n\r\nOkay back to Shiroe the protagonist. I like Shiroe because he really had something to do, not just randomly meets people who brought him to do something (yes, i bet you know that kind of plot) , instead he \"gathers those people\" and bring them (much likely manipulate them) into bigger fate.. Every character in Log Horizon plays their part good like a well built legos, what i mean is the role of the character fits to the plot piece by piece, i love legos..  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 :\\n\r\n\"Much like SAO, with more brains..\"\\n\r\nI enjoy LH so much i've finished it in 2 days row.\\n\r\nWell, thats what i want to say.. Have a good day, folks..",

            "content": "After in my opinion disappointing Sword Art Online about people trapped in MMORPG that has little to do with actual game, here comes an anime that makes those who played RPG games fall in love with this show. In this review I will sum up both seasons since season 2 changed my mind about some aspects.\r\nPlot:\r\nThe world where the action takes place is similar to game, but since players get there after new update, world they were supposed to know well look a bit different. Story is logical and tries to explain every aspect of the world leaving only few minor plot holes. First episodesmay go really slow as we get descriptions of combat mechanics, skill effects, classes and races. With lots of terms  (raid, hp, tank, dps, kiting and so on) making this show addressed more for those, who are familiar with MMORPGs but still explain it for other viewers. This anime will remind you the great feelings you got from playing MMO. Story is based on light novels and the best comparison would be to To Aru Majutsu No Index. Lots of characters and minor events covering major part of the show making it look like it's doesn't have the end bu tin fact slowly set up scene for bigger and exciting plot twists and battles. Also as the plot wasn't meant for anime, seasons don't end at certain point. Interesting thing is that dying doesn't make you die for real (like in SAO) but you will respawn. That doesn't mean it doesn't have consequences or makes show less entertaining. Also it makes it more realistic when people die during the raid (healers won't survive AoE attack just because they're main characters). NPCs are also different from those from actual game and without spoiling too much I have to say that this anime made a really interesting point and it feels like author seriously wanted \"if games were real\" scenario.\\n\r\nMain characters at the start of the series have already level 90 (maximum but now they can reach level 100) so instead of watching how they fight with rats and skeletons to level up they will go for high level dungeons and fight raid bosses. Raids and wars are really spectacular and keeping in tension. The important thing is that most of the events are world scale that can make impact on thousand of players and NPCs. \\n\r\nDownside of this anime is that sometimes plot literally freezes for couple of episodes. Some parties and festival barely impact the plot and put an impact on doing funny situations making you consider whether to drop this anime or not. But then out of nowhere appears a threat that keeps you glued to the screen for couple of next episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIf you thought that main character has to be super strong and swing his sword from left to right and beat everyone on his own then this anime will prove you're wrong. Shiroe is enchanter (support class that mainly buffs allies). Instead of powrful warrior this anime gives us strategist who stands on back lines and commands the whole group. \\n\r\nAkatsuki and Naotsugu looked like main characters in first episode, but they get little screen time and almost no character development (except few episodes in season 2). Akatsuki is short and loves main character and that's basically all information we get about her which is really disappointing. There are a lot of characters and even though we don't see then too often, all of them have impact on the plot and can be enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\nCharatcers worth mentioning are group of kids that made bad first impression on me and i thought their adventures will be just boring part of the plot. But in fact they were one of the best part. You will see how they go from unexperienced kids to well organized team that manages to actually do something. For example Tohya seems to be just for screaming and slicing minions, but throughout the series he proves to be more than this (especially in season 2). They have really great character development except for Serara who for me was annoying and boring from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDatabase, database, just living in the database....\\n\r\nOne of the best opening I ever heard and it's easy to understand why they kept it for 50 episodes. Other than that there are soundtracks that sound like they took it from actual RPG game. That's where it's worth to compare to Sword Art Online. Yes, it had good soundtrack, but it could be implemented in any other anime. In Log Horizon soundtrack is unique and fits to this fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSimilar to music. There's no point in doing animations with the newest style if you can make it the way it synergies with plot and music. \\n\\n\r\nAlso Minor spoiler about one of the best experience from this anime:\\n\r\nI liked how they showed status windows of all players after they all died in raid. When you played MMO you probably had that moment when either you died and just watched how other struggle or remained the only one alive and looked at all those bars saying 0hp knowing that it's over and you have to start the fight all over again.\\n",

It was a really enjoyable expierence.\r\nLog Horizon is one of those animes that will constantly keep on hetting compared to similar works, for example .Hack and Sword Art Online. However, Log Horizon picks up where both SAO AND .Hack failed, and put its own twist on things.\r\nTo start off, Log Horizon is one of my favorites fall 2013 animes. Like a lot of shows, this show might be great but also has its shares of flaws\r\n For the good, the characters were great. Each of them had somethinggoing for them and they were well developed. The story was also interesting, taking its focus on the political and world building aspects instead of SAO wwhich followed a weak romance but excellent action. Not to say Log Horizon has action. Itdoes, but it isn't the main focus. The soundtrack of Log Horizon is groovy, especially the Opening and Ending songs. \\n\r\nHowever, Log Horizon did take awhile to start off with at least 3-4 episodes to get into it. Also the art and animation isn't the most spetacular like Attack on Titan or anything. But it did its job pretty good. There were some pacing issues about halfway through the series, where some arcs dragged on for awhile, but it didn't bother as many people as I thought. \\n\r\nAll and All, Log Horizon is a great anime that I had a blast watching. It welcomes both gamers and non-gamers, giving info such as what does HP/MP mean, and the variety of classes one can expect from an MMO. \\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for something to fill that void from SAO, or someone just looking for a smart and fun anime.",

It will give us the opportunity to solve all the 'mysteries'that have arisen in the first season.\r\nNow as to further explain my score for this anime. \r\nThe story may seem a bit slow and boring in the beginning but it quickly improves making it extremely hard to stop watching (something that is quite a feat for any anime to accomplish). I would have to point out though that the story progression speed is much slower than in SAO.The reason I am mentioning this is because loads of people like to compare the two to great lengths.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic. It is quite obvious that the development team put a lot of thought into the anime. There are several occasions where I was quite bedazzled by the background scenery.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the fact that the story progresses in slower than usual speed, we get to know the main protagonists better. In Log Horizon I can admit that I have a good understanding as to what drives each character and what motivates them in pursuing their paths within the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found Log Horizon to be very enjoyable and I would recommend it to all who like this particular genre. Being an MMO gamer would also help to further enjoy the anime since you will be able to relate to several aspects of the world but it is not essential.",

            "content": "If you come into Log Horizon thinking 'Its just another SAO' you're sadly mistaken. Log Horizon is in many aspects what SAO should have aspired to be. Here's why I think so:\r\nStory: It's been done before and it'll be done again. People are stuck in a video game. However while SAO focuses on trying to escape in Log Horizon the cast accepts this as their new world for the time being. Bringing the game to crossbreed with reality really gives this show an interesting feel; one example is that the 'adventurers' (AKA Humans/ Non-NPC's) can create/ invent something using the materials in the game.\r\nArt: Whileinitial impressions of the art may be somewhat cartoonish or minutely detailed. this is a misconception. As you progress in the story we see into the casts life outside of the game and with reality comes a much more realistic western looking feel to the art. While Kirito looks just the same as Kazuto Log Horizon strives to show you there IS a difference between the two.\\n\\n\r\nSound: As far as the audio goes nothing too amazing. The background score was perhaps a bit unappealing to me but as far as the OP and ED go the ED is in my opinion much more appealing to listen to. The microphone quality with the actors was nice as well. Even when things are much more quiet you cannot hear any microphone white noise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Instead of placing the MC as a over confident ass hat who's a total loner and gets all the ladies; Shiroe is much more calm and collected. he relies on his friends and doesn't emit lady killing pheromones. Log Horizon takes into account all kinds of people you may meet in a MMORPG from the hard core RPers to the PKers. Another interesting aspect is the now sentient NPC's Adding a whole new layer of depth to the game.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For a shonen this anime follows many tropes but in other ways it stands out. While you do have your totally normal and mainstream hype fights where good meets bad and they fight it out with an epic climax it still catches your attention as you'd suspect. Sometimes the climax doesn't always need fighting- In one particular case the climax is after the fighting's said and done so our MC has to make a very important choice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: You can approach Log Horizon any number of ways. Coming off SAO thinking 'Wow that was bad maybe this'll be better' or perhaps 'Wow that was amazing this probably sucks' maybe you're coming in blind with no prior experience with the 'trapped in a game' plot but I can almost assure you this show will not fail to please. It mixes everything you like about Shonen with some more serious tones to make a valuable experience.",

At the same time people wanting a lot of senseless fights won't find it here so I guess not everybody will like it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I really liked the first season of Log Horizon, and even though it is not perfect, and it's not one of those anime that will blow your mind, it works very well with its characters and setting to make a really immersive world.\\n\r\n I would recommend it to anyone wanting to see a good shonen, an anime related to videogames or a fantasy setting.

            "content": "Log Horizon falls behind its peers when it comes to consistent action and flair. That aside, the series is a triumphant example of how to create a fully realized MMO setting. \r\nCharacter development is unquestioningly the strongest aspect of the show. You'll see not just the main character, but all the secondary and even tertiary characters being fully fleshed out. Every character is unique and memorable, and they all feel like they have an impact in the world, instead of just being fluff for the story. \r\nThe story of being stuck in a virtual world and trying to get out is obviously not new, butLog Horizon's approach to this genre is a big breath of fresh air. Without saying too much, death in this game isn't permanent, but it's not without its consequences. The economic and social aspects of MMO, including its NPCs, also have some much needed light shed on them as they play a very big role in the show's plot. Many of these situations revolve around Shiroe,with his cunning diplomacy being the most surprisingly thrilling moments in the Log Horizon.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is a bit slow at first, and there's some humor that seems a little forced (ie Akatsuki's abuse of Naotsugu), but once it picks up speed, Log Horizon does not fail to entertain. Seeing Shiroe staying a step ahead and pulling aces out of his sleeve is far more fun than seeing an overpowered shonen pulling deus ex machina moments to get out of a situation (you know who I'm talking about). With its rich setting, colorful cast , excellent writing and the promise of a second season, Log Horizon should be a vital part of your anime collection",

            "content": "A different approach to the \"trapped in a videogame\" genre that is rapidly gaining popularity, Log Horizon serves as a refreshing, albeit somewhat underdeveloped alternative to Sword Art Online. Whereas Sword Art Online focuses on the challenges of gaming with higher stakes, Log Horizon revolves around creating and managing the social infrastructure of a fledgling world. A unique story that deals in both fanciful dilemmas and real-world issues, Log Horizon presents itself as a dual-threat of escapism and introspection. However, despite flashing several moments of brilliance, the series ultimately concludes with an unfinished feel and sense of unrealized potential.\r\nStory: 5\r\n  The story of LogHorizon begins as one of its greatest strengths, but eventually turns into the most glaring issue in the series. The decision to avoid the overused \"dungeon-clearing\" and \"boss battle\" motifs was inspired. The focus instead on social interactions and infrastructure following the trauma of becoming stuck in a videogame was what originally drew my attention to the show. The first third of the story expands upon this with several excellent twists and one of the true gems of Log Horizon. The rest of the show fails to keep up this pace, however, leading to a sense of frustration and disappointment from the viewer. There were several promising points in the middle section of the series where the story could have branched off, often with exciting prospects and the opportunity to further develop characters or storyline. These points were ignored, however, yielding several important confrontations brushed past with only a vague Band-Aid type fix. This trend continued to the end of the season, where the conclusion of the show appears intentionally vague, despite numerous simmering problems that have been pushed to the back-burner. While the ending appears open enough to support further redress of these issues in following seasons, the lack of determination to follow any one direction leaves the plot mediocre at best. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\n  Similarly, the characters of Log Horizon all flare with brilliant emotional potential, but end with only one bulletproof and intriguing character. The main protagonist, Shiroe -colloquially referred to a the \"Villain in Glasses\"- is a solid and ever-intriguing anchor for the show. A strategic genius with a penchant for surprise, he is a director-in-the-shadows and a joy to watch when placed in the spotlight. The supporting cast, while initially interesting, falls flat as the story progresses, with little to no effort placed into learning their backstories or motivations. While one exception is the goofy and unexpected Rundelhaus, the supporting crew is overshadowed by Shiroe, and in the end serve only to bog the story down rather than expand it. The lack of any specific or significant antagonists only emphasizes the dearth of meaningful interactions between supporting characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\n  The art is nothing to write home about, but is adequate and does not detract from the show. Character design is generic, while environment design is slightly above average. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\n  The sound was surprisingly my favorite part of Log Horizon. A very different and surprisingly catchy intro theme had me bobbing my head even as I made food while waiting for the episode to start. The English in the intro is surprisingly clear, although not devoid of accent, and demonstrates a clear grammatical fluency. The lyrics are simple, yet synergistic with the feel of the show. The ending song, while less impressive, still shines. Sound effects are generally discreet, with good synergy during crucial points in the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\n  While not heavy on battle or \"action\" per se, Log Horizon excelled at engendering interest for the diplomatic crises scattered throughout it. An ability to surprise the viewer with unexpected story progression kept me interested throughout, despite the subpar closure following each conflict. Near the end my interest waned, as I realized it was too late to follow several of the story branches I was hoping to see. A vague and open story ending is intriguing, although the various plot errors amassed to create an average viewing experience from my standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\n  Log Horizon stands as a notable counterpoint to Sword Art Online, but overall fails to adhere to a single storyline long enough to develop its wide array of characters. This is a good anime for intellectuals interested in government, politics, diplomacy and strategy, but is unable to provide viewers with memorable character interactions or satisfactory story.",

This is the real MMORPG anime, here we go.\r\n[This review will NOT contain spoilers]\r\n[Story 8]\r\nFrom the beginning we are immersed in the context that the real world is no more, we are in a video game. No questions asked (well, there are, but that is not the point). Like if you woke up from a dream and you are now in a new world, you have to carry on, cope with it, buildyour new life in this new world.\\n\r\nThe approach is very interesting, and as I could see and experience with the anime, it was a good choice.\\n\\n\r\nIt has MMORPG battles, real use of the mechanics of the game, slice of life... this last one is very important, because as I said, your life is now this new world, the characters have to become one with new world as they did with the old one.\\n\\n\r\n[Art 7]\\n\r\nThe art is good, not astonishing but good. You can really feel good with the animations, and backgrounds. Not much I can say in this section.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound 8]\\n\r\nA lot of in-game sounds, FX and a good OST. That Opening is going to be stuck in your head for a long time.\\n\\n\r\n[Character 8]\\n\r\nAlmost all characters in this anime are well developed, and that's much to say since there are a lot of characters! You don't get backstories since they understand the past is the past, and they don't care much what they were but what they are now and what they can do.\\n\r\nBut, some characters get backstory, and that gets reflected on how they act and how they development as a characters in the series progresses. It helps you to understand their lives and why they are the way they are. It's difficult to dislike a character in Log Horizon.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment 8]\\n\r\nDatabase! Database! Just living in the database! Database! Just say Wow wow wow wow! (That speaks for itself)\\n\\n\r\n[Overall 8]\\n\r\nThis anime really is worth watching. Doesn't matter if you are or not into MMORPG games, the story is appealing, good characters, development, pacing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult not to compared it with that other anime but, this is a different league. Trust me on this, this is another level above.",

Hopefully a third season comes out in the future to wrap everything up. \r\n[*]Some episodes can be slow paced and drag out. For those craving lots of action and violence this isn't the series for that.\r\n[*]Our main character is a tactical genius. Shiroe plans everything out and lets his friends do some of the dirty work. \r\n[*]There are light elements of romance along with love triangles. However its never fully fleshed out.\r\n[*]Lots of world building and political court intrigue.The NPCs are alive in the video game world. Our adventurers are the outsiders. All of this gets blended together beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Log Horizon is a good show and it's certainly worth checking out.  It's slow paced nature and a few boring episodes tend to drag down the enjoyment factor just a bit.",

I think Log Horizon is a better choice for me because of the strategical moves in combat and economical-political issues. \r\nI like how they introduce us the world-Elder Tale- with a smart character. You can catch the basics of the game after a few episodes. If you are already a game player it can be more enjoyable. There is always new things you can discover about the games. I was really suprised they understand that the world's rulesis different from the game and you can cook, build with your skills. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are very likeable. I found all of them interesting. I thought I would bored when they are educating the lower levels. But it also help me to get team playing in the game and I like how they are attaching each other and in this way improve their combat. \\n\\n\r\nSome parts is heavy but if you enjoy how to build a society and solve the problems you can adapt easily. \\n\\n\r\nI still wonder about the character's real world stories and what happened to their bodies. I hope we can learn about it more in the next seasons.\\n\\n\r\nAt last I enjoyed so much. The combats, character's interactions, build a society concept are perfect for my taste.\\n\\n",

I know quite a few people love Sword Art Online but why are we kidding ourselves, SAO originally started off with a solid story random people being trapped in a MMORPG universe but it quickly dissolved when they decided to cram two different games into one single season.  Log Horizon however did not fall for this same major issue but being consistent.  These people are trapped in Elder Tale and they have no idea whenthey'll get home or even if they'll get home.  Another thing that really kept my interest is you see the players actively using their combat/ui hud throughout the series, blast to the past another great series that did this was .hack//sign.  This series is about the people that played on the Yamamoto Server of Elder Tale (a popular MMORPG at the time) when they suddenly find themselves trapped in the game.  This event will later become known as The Cataclysm and throughout the series the characters don't make futile unbelievable attempts at escaping instead they try to find a way to live with their circumstances.  Shiro the series protagonist (also known as Villain in Glasses) mainly because his motives for the greater good sometimes become misconstrued by others around him.  Shiro is the leader of a guild (after The Cataclysm) called Log Horizon and people also known him before The Cataclysm as a member of the legendary party known as Debauchery Tea Party.  This series is worth the watch if you enjoy shonen and game related animes.",

There is no point that catches your eye, only the protagonist Shiroe, is interesting.\r\nThe art of the characters and environment, along with the background music, do not call attention, are normal and just complement the adventure, nothing surprising. That's what I missed.\r\nMost characters are silly. They are only useful for the jokes, for the story are totally unnecessary. Henrietta and Marielle are characters that should have been important to the story, but only serve to make too many reactions. \"Aaah, howbeautiful you look in that dress\" or \"aaah, let me hug you Naotsugu\" ... this is embarrassing. Only characters that delay me are Shiroe and Nyanta, the rest do not even remember the names. This is very sad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can say that I did not like it so much, but I did not hate it either. It's an ordinary anime. It did not mark me negatively or positively.

            "content": "Please keep in mind that this is my opinion of Log Horizon. It is also my first review so please don't be too critical.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is about our main characters  finding themselves in a world similar to Elder Tale- an MMOPRG that they all played. Now the characters have to find out why that has happened and how to get back to their world. \r\nWhat I love about the story telling of this anime is that they don't immediately jump to characters trying to find their way home. The characters actually take time to explore the world and learn how is it different fromthe game they are used to playing. As a result, this creates world building and helps us learn more about the characters. \\n\r\nWhat I don't like is the fact that the show very heavy on exposition and character interaction and there is no sense of urgency from the characters on wanting to get back home. As a result, sometimes the story feels slow pace. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nSince the anime is mostly runs on character interaction and exposition, there is not a lot of action sequences as a result the animation during those scenes are not very exceptional but it is better than average and watchable. With that being said, the animation during some of the background sceneries were lovely and memorable. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime is very well done. None of the tracks seemed out of place with any of the scenes to me and some of the tracks were especially memorable. I also love the opening. It was the same opening for all 25 episodes of the show and I did not skip it on any episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon has a large cast of diverse main characters. With that being said, none of the main characters were ever side tracked. Every character had a role to play in the overall story arc. This could range from being the star of the arc to being a source of motivation for the character despite only having one conversation with the character. They also try to make sure that the main characters have some form of development. \\n\r\nThe downside is that because there is such a large cast, the characters does not receive as much development as they could have.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed this anime a lot. I have not watched a lot MMORPG  anime, because sometimes it's hard for me to follow the story but this anime really helped understand the story due to the heavy exposition and explanation. I also liked how the anime stayed true to it's MMORPG style and  yet did something very unique and different compare to it's predecessor. \\n\r\nAlso, while the characters may lack development, they are memorable and unique when compared to their stereotypes and I also enjoyed watching them interact with one another and with the world they are living in. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anyone who loves MMORPG style games because of how it's sticks true to it's MMORPG style and too anyone who doesn't mind if they show is more based on character interaction and exposition rather than action. I also recommend it to those who don't mind a slow paced story.",

Obviously you're not gonna make a harem, reject all of them and at some point romancing with your sister, then continue beating a dead horse when it looked like it could have concluded for half a season.\r\nLog Horizon did the whole 'Stuck in an unknown world' correctly. Each person has their ideas to live off the unknown land, creating society, making businesses, inventing things that could give an edge to everyone. The different thing about the show from the rest of it's kind ishow it treats the 'unknown world' as really unknown. In under any circumstances you do not get fancy with the whole situation that quick, the shock sinks in on the characters for quite a while. Nothing seems to be what they thought it would be to live in a world beloved by them before. So, to make things work, they decided to do whatever it takes to survive and live in the enigma.\\n\\n\r\nLooking for intense action? Watch Log horizon, wanna know what happens daily when you're stuck in a video game? watch Log horizon. Looking for hot romance between the protagonist and some girls? Don't watch Log horizon. \\n",

They all learn new skills and a new way of living in that game.  \r\nArt 6:  Nothing really exciting here, there were a couple of fights that had good animation, but other than that it was very basic.  Very weak art during the fights, thought it would be better.\r\nSound 6:  Intro is a good song, but throughout the anime there wasn'ta track that got my attention and it the battle sounds were weak.  Voice were good, I think they were all well placed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7:  They were pretty good, very funny moments in the anime.  Development was on point, since they all had to learn and adjust.

However, sometimes all you need is a tried and tested formula which has been executed well and in that regard Log Horizon is a great show to watch.\r\nThe one aspect which sets this show apart from contemporaries like Overlord is how it handles the 'MMO' part of the MMORPG setting. Game mechanics, their consequences and their effect on not just combat but also the world in general has been well thought out and makes sense within the realmof the plot setting. While the show does have it's share of powerful individuals, it balances their abundance of power with adequate plot development. Obviously there are a few predictable tropes with regards to the comedy and the interpersonal dynamics of a guild, however, all that is done in appropriate quantities and it doesn't take your attention away from the plot. \\n\\n\r\nIn many respects, the show is like Nanatsu No Taizai. It doesn't have a complicated or unique story, but the way the story has been executed makes watching it fresh and entertaining. Furthermore, this show has shown to me the importance of being a man with glasses (you'll understand what I mean when you watch the show). Looking forward to munching down the second season, and while a third season seems unlikely, I guess I'll just keep enjoying the after taste after I finish watching it all.",

            "content": "Review in brief: Season 1 of Log Horizon presents a truly faithful rendition of the \"trapped in an MMO\" setting and provides an interesting story to go with it but suffers from slow progression and predictability. Your enjoyment will hinge on how well you stay immersed in the world of Elder Tale and while this anime does a good job of getting you to enter there's no guarantee that it will hold you in.\r\nReview in full: When it comes to engagement, Log Horizon places heavy focus on just one aspect: immersion. It wants you to enter its world, explore both its realms and game-like mechanics,experience the cultures of the pre-existing NPCs and the newly trapped gamers, and ultimately feel like you're on an adventure in the world of Elder Tale yourself. This is accomplished quite well. Right from the get-go the characters realize that they must use the mechanics of the game (including classes, cool-down abilities, and now-telepathic voice chat) to thrive, but they are all still gamers at heart and also start developing new strategies to handle everything from cooking to spell-casting.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this is going on there are bigger implications that are explored in a game world made real. What happens when NPCs are no longer just walking dialogue boxes but living, breathing beings? Or when magic is no longer just game code and becomes a real form of energy? Even politics and the economy become major issues as time goes on. Being trapped in a video game isn't just a gimmick or plot device in Log Horizon, it's the very essence of everything it is and does.  Together with the well-established setting (which is continuously being fleshed out) it creates the captivating sense that the story is much bigger than just what we see the characters going though.  Even when Log Horizon wasn\u2019t enjoyable for me, this sense gave me reason to believe that something more was just an episode away.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as production values go, the animation does a great job of displaying both the world and the video game elements without either looking out of place.  This is including the CG, as even though it stands out compared to the animation at times it still feels like it belongs in the context of how it\u2019s being used. The familiar yet fantastical designs of the environments and the characters also do a remarkable job of making it all feel like its own world as well as its own game, cultivating strong visual immersion to complement its narrative immersion. Meanwhile the music, sound effects, and voice-work (I watched in Japanese) is good (but not great) all around.  It does its job and there isn't anything to complain about but not much of it is memorable either (aside from the oddly catchy OP).\\n\\n\r\nSadly, beyond that Log Horizon's presentation transforms the story from an intricate exercise in how a world can be built from the mechanics that drive it into a lazy shounen adventure adaptation where the premise is only used as a hook to get you to watch the next episode each week. It's as though the story is being held hostage by the producers, demanding that you watch more than what's necessary to continue.  This is largely due to the show\u2019s slow progression.  It's not much of an issue early on since there's initially quite a bit that the anime has to and does explain, but after the first third of the season it finds itself with too little to explain to justify the pace and starts spacing itself out instead.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the world is established each subsequent arc features a barrage of recaps, which not only include the typical beginning-of-the-episode refreshers but also many mid-episode reminders, cues, and hints; so many in fact that by the time each arc comes to a head so many hints have been dropped that you know how the arc ends before it even reaches a climax, destroying the dramatic build-up of tension the intricate story naturally contains.  It's like reading a good book next to an acquaintance who is constantly asking if you've reached the next big spoilery event, with no attempt to mask the spoiler itself.  These are then interlaced with so much shallow comedy (especially with the pervert jokes and ship-teases that you'd have to be blind to not see coming) and boring filler (such as pointless side plots and clearly one-sided battles) that it all takes up more time than the serious moments that progress the plot.  Everything that actually matters could have been covered in 13 episodes with room to spare, but Log Horizon doesn't trust its viewers to understand or remember anything that takes more than two sentences to explain.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, while Log Horizon's characters are utilized well by the story, the characters themselves are mostly nothing special. The majority of them fill a role, perform that role, and nothing more, while most of the rest don\u2019t even manage that. Development and backstories beyond a few bullet-points (predictable clich\u00e9s included) are for but a select few characters. You'll likely find two or three of them to be particularly interesting, but many of them are easily forgettable. There is even a plot development tied to the game's XP system that offers a great opportunity to take a closer look at the characters in that moment before things change for them, but nothing substantial was done with it and it passed with just a brief mention. It also doesn't help that there's very little that is able to challenge them. The fact that the trapped gamers are overpowered even becomes a plot point, though again it\u2019s merely stated rather than addressed. Regardless it doesn\u2019t help that few characters have any real reason to develop when all they have to do is listen to Shiroe for everything to turn out okay (or if they\u2019re one of the handful of cookie-cutter villains, wait for Shiroe to defeat them because they had no chance to win in the first place).\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:  Log Horizon\u2019s first season could have easily been great, in fact it definitely was for the first third, but its faults severely damage the majority of the show.  Even then I could almost still say it\u2019s good because underneath all of the mindless filler & overused tropes lies an interesting concept, quality production values, and the beginnings of an amazing plot.  Unfortunately, the product as a whole just isn\u2019t entertaining or intricate enough to cope with its faults.  I can\u2019t recommend Log Horizon to a general audience, though if you\u2019re a big fan of isekai or anime about video games you may find enough to enjoy here to make it all worthwhile.",

Only slightly though. \r\nThis show could've really made it less boring.\r\nStory 6:\r\nIt felt like they were trying to teach me how to play an MMORPG and I really don't care about every detail of skills and classes and what not. I mean I would've been fine with a little bit of an explanation, but hey lets spend half an episode expaining this thing in explicate detail because why the hell not?\r\nIt's like finishing the tutorial of a game and then they're like \"haha jk here's the rest ofthe tutorial bitch\".\\n\\n\r\nArt 5:\\n\r\nThe art at least fit in with the show. Actually it got kinda lazy at some moments, but not too noticable. It was okay, but nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7:\\n\r\nThe music was very... mediocre. In fact the only reason it's a 7 is because of how ridiculous the opening was. They could of at least changed the opening and ending after the halfway mark.\\n\r\nOr at least the ending cuz, if I heard \"zutto\" one more time. I was gonna commit mass murder I'd be called the Zutto murderer. Because that was the last thing you will hear ever hear before your life ends in a horrific and inhuman way, while your only functioning body part, your ears, will hear \"zuu-ooooootoooooo\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7:\\n\r\nMost of the characters were pretty annoying. The princess, whose name I won't bother spelling, was the only character I kinda liked. Other than that though no one else. The romance between the characters was not over played or, it just wasn't that annoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5:\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, just boring. I'm actually pretty fond of boring things so I think it wasn't boring, just uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a 6 ,cuz it just wasn't my cup of tea. Although if you like bitter and kinda stupid tea then this show is for you. It did have some good points like how it ended. Writing this review actually made me hate the show more. I don't think I'll be watching season 2, unless I feel like dying then I'll proceed to it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Log Horizon is a story of being trapped within the world of Elder Tales, an MMO game. I watched the anime and read the light novels. Its protagonist is Shiroe, an enchanter with a wicked reputation. We follow him as he deals with the reality of being trapped in the game world. He meets a zany cast of characters as he tries to find a way back to the real world.\r\nI thought it had a good premise and was well executed. It doesn't uplift anime or light novels as a medium but offered an adequate story of discovery and adventure for the audience. One ofthe weaknesses of Japanese anime and light novels is the overuse of the same tropes and cliches. They are present here but thankfully don't detract the fun from the story. \\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon will undoubtedly be compared to 2012's hit series Sword Art Online. I consider Log Horizon to be the superior due to its more realistic portrayal of human psychology and the non-presence of blatant wish fulfillment.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon doesn't suffer from many weaknesses but it does nothing to differentiate itself from what has been done before. As I am really fond of numerical values I give the first season of Log Horizon a 4/5.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. The opening song Database was definitely one of the catchiest I've heard yet.",

It focuses heavilyon a group of kids just learning the game, some diplomatic wrangling with one of the NPC countries and preparing for some war against a horde of goblins.",

            "content": "What this series brings to the table is a look into the lives of individuals who are trapped in a video game, more specifically an MMO rpg. This is actually nothing new in the realm of anime, but that matters not so as long as its execution is well done. Unfortunately this is were it falls short, since it's entire set up lends itself to underwhelming drama, being that characters don't die when they are killed. (yes that was intentional) With this revelation, much of what was a stake feels lost, although they could have gone in a direction that expands upon other consequences ofexisting in this world being that it is not the one they once knew, which they do address to some extent, but they are all underplayed to the point where it seems they don't even really pose a great treat or concern beyond moving the plot forward. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the plot, The everyday life of people in a video game is what the series should be called, since not much exploration into the nature of being an alternate persona (Which .hack//sign addresses), political intrigue or the relationship between the supposed people of the land and the adventures is really present beyond the superficial and in some ways childish. Everything lends itself to be treated like another quest to go out and complete, which ironically works against the show in trying to build a coherent narrative. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also tries to act smart many times almost as if it's trying to prove that it's not a typical shounen, however everything is explained exactly when it happens for the first time in the series, which means the classic case of someone standing still and explaining what he just did in the middle of a heated battle.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this show I do admit does well is the atmosphere and feeling of being in an MMO rpg, which despite never really having played one that in depth, they definitely did their homework. (unlike Sword Art Online) Though the more I watch of the show the more it felt like a gimmick rather than something the show was using to create an engaging narrative, with characters being quite one note due to a lack of potential within the story for any catharsis. The characters are fun enough for the style this show goes for, but are not deep or complicating in any way. They are easily defined by a few quirks and simple mentalities, which is usually there just for the sake of laughs as the anime is very easy going. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say the anime does try do be more than your typical anime, but it holds itself back with what could have been done with its set up and fails to fully deliver, as it takes itself way to easy being only enjoyable for those who want there anime about MMOs to make sense, which at the very least, it achieves that. \\n",

            "content": "4 Words\r\nNOT Sword Art Online.\r\nWhilst SAO had arguably superior art there is something charming about the art and character design in log horizon from Shiroe to Regan. The characters I say make a show. Here there are loads which I find great especially as they are all unique....well except that everyone has a hidden skill....PUSHING YOUR GLASSES SLIGHTLY UP!!! When this happens you know something is about to happen. Shiroe isn't called the \"Villian behind Glasses\" for nothing! The settings and background art are great.\r\nThis series plays on the idea that you have just got out of dreary old work and are shut in agame. But you have no idea apart there was an update. Who would want to go from fun game to school and work..*cough* SAO *cough*.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon also understands the concept of MMOs. One of its greatest attributes is that it takes time to explain the world from politics to geography and servers to attacks. Every attack has a background and when first used Shiroe or another character explains it, its fascinating. Talking about attacks, its also fun to see the 3 main characters start at Max level 90, but the limit has just been raised to 100, its not some generic shounen where friendship, love and randomly swinging a sword around solves it all *cough* SAO *cough*.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst there is lots of talking it just adds to the world it creates. On this topic whilst some may disagree and say sub is better I watched sub then dub but I found the dub better for me. Some disagree with Mike Yager as Shiroe but I love his voice as Shiroe its bland and bleak...like a strategist should be - calm not screaming like Kirito! Akatsuki and Crusty also had great dub actors.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the music can be repetitive I liked it..not sure why but I loved it and DATABASE DATABASE at the start of each episode is a guilty pleasure. The writing for the script is amazing and congrats to Mamare Touno for the great Light Novel source. He understands politics, economics, under handed tactics and of course MMOs.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation? Standard but endearing!\\n\\n\r\nNow the story....adapting and waiting not screaming, panicking and trying to escape. This allows a world of monsters and events which seem basic to a gamer but in reality in log horizon forgetting an event can cost you dearly just wait for it! Royalty, commoners and bending the rules. Log horizons base game the one they are stuck in is called \"Eldertale\" and has lots of mechanisms for peace and fair play. But its great when Shiroe and other characters exploit loopholes as they are now able to do many more things than when the put commands into a computer.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way Season 2 is awesome!!! Especially the first half and the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 for having a great story, great characters, great setting, great ideas, great writing, atmosphere, world building and did I mention endearing characters?!?!?!\\n\\n\r\nGive it a watch. Both seasons. But on season 1 dubbed at the moment I think. By the way Satelight animate the 1st season but for reasons DEEN got the 2nd Cour! Well enjoy it and you can't hate Akatsuki! BY THE WAY IT IS NOT SWORD ART ONLINE I think it's insulting that people compare them and say Log Horizon is a rip off of SAO. SAO probably stole from .back, and if we went like this then you could say anime steals from everyone.\\n\\n\r\nWell I enjoyed it and let's hope Mamare Touno gets a few more light novels out so we can have season 3!!!\\n\\n\r\nFor other suggestions I would point you to SAO to see the major differences for yourself but I warn you its very bad for your health! Another good anime is Maoyu maou Yuusha also by Mamare Touno. And finally not so related is Rokka no Yuusha but it also has great characters, story and setting where they are also trapped but in a much smaller area, both anime make you think.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you learn something from this review and all the best to you!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This was my first review if you couldn't tell from the sloppiness :)",

No! I\u2019m sick of it! I\u2019m sick of people adding romance into an anime when it\u2019s not needed! What the hell is the point of adding romance into Log Horizon? Tell me! Is the writer catering to the female audience or something? Or do guys actually enjoy reading about love triangles too? Because I sure as hell am sick of it! If I wanted to watch romance, I\u2019d go watch a damn shoujo or something labeled as \u201cromance\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBut when romance is added into my shounen, I get sick of it!\\n\\n\r\nLook, maybe I\u2019m making the wrong impression here.

Shiroe was a teacher figure to Minori, a big brother figure. But no, she ends up falling for him? Wha? Why? How? But most of all WHY? The creator(s) better have a damn good reason for having this stupid love triangle pop out of nowhere from Log Horizon\u2019s ass!\\n\\n\r\nSome of you may say I\u2019m making a big deal out of this, but believe me, these little \"details\" matter too. Of course, I will give Log Horizon 2 a chance once it\u2019s finished. But I swear, if that *BEEP*ing love triangle is shoved into my face again, I\u2019m going to go super saiyan and choke whoever thought it was a good idea to add a love triangle into this series in the first place!",

            "content": "WARNING, MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS!\r\nLog Horizon\r\nReview By: John Fragglepuss Evans\r\nBe warned, Log Horizon is not Sword Art Online. If you go into this anime expecting it to be the same as SAO, you will most likely be disappointed. If you start watching Log Horizon with an open mind and an open heart, you will have a much better chance at enjoying it. Also, there  is subtle humor throughout Log Horizon, which is well-placed.\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You are on the prowl for a lot of strategic, political action. Also, if you are looking for a gentleman cat-person, you found your anime!\r\nYou might notlike it if: You are on the hunt for the battle-scene action.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: This is not Sword Art Online.\\n\\n\r\nEXPANDED REVIEW:\\n\\n\r\nOur anime group, Salt Lake City (SLC) Anime, reviewed Log Horizon this month and here is what the group thought:\\n\\n\r\nThere were several Pros and Cons about Log Horizon, and these all differed depending on the person. Log Horizon is not like Sword Art Online, in that there is not a lot of action. There is a lot of strategic, political planning. This is not bad at first, but carried on through the whole series. I mean, it\u2019s an MMORPG, there should be battles at some point.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of interaction with NPCs, or People of the Land as they are referred to. This also means that there is more of a political system in the world.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the first episode, there is hardly a mention of leaving the virtual world until the last episode. It makes it seem as if nobody cares that they are stuck in a video game. It is a 25 episode season, and you never see what their life is outside the virtual world, and it hardly even gets mentioned that this is not their real life.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters with a lot of stories, and many of the character\u2019s stories get left in the dust because there is too much going in. This ties into the romantic interests of the characters. While there is not a lot of romance in the anime, what little love interest exists is inconsistent throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon does a great job at explaining basic MMORPG terminology and blending that into episodes. People not familiar with the MMORPG world will be able to understand the virtual world well.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes a while for many of the characters to grow on you. A lot of them have a stereotypical introduction, but then develop as the season progresses. Others seem to get ignored, and you only see them every couple episodes even though they were a prominent character at the beginning of the season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SLC Anime enjoyed Log Horizon, giving it a favorable review. Just remember, once again, not to compare it to Sword Art Online.",

            "content": "I'm a sucker for video game/isekai anime. After finishing SAO (before the newer seasons came out), I was looking for something similar to watch. EVERYONE who I knew that had a remote interest in anime told me to watch Log Horizon, and how it was so much better than SAO. \r\nAfter watching a good majority of it, I can conclusively say I don't understand why people say that this is WAY better than SAO. I'm not saying SAO was this fantastic, God-given gift to the anime world, it definitely has some glaring flaws and issues, but how people can say Log Horizon is \"way\" betteris beyond me. Are No Game No Life and Re:Zero better than SAO? Yeah, I could agree with that, but not Log Horizon. \\n\\n\r\nIn watching this series, I have paused or dropped it around three or four times. Not because the animation is bad, not because the characters are bad, not because the sound is bad, no, not any of that, although I'll cover those later in the review. No, my biggest complaint about Log Horizon is how dreadfully boring it is. Every time I come back to watching it, I am constantly reminded of why I dropped it in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I elaborate, let me briefly explain this show's high points. The animation and design of the Elder Tale world and characters are very clean. Each of the backgrounds have a stunning attention to detail, and the different characters introduced have interesting designs and personalities (for the most part). \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also a great strength of Log Horizon. Similar to many other fantasy-themed anime, there's a very \"olde\" vibe to the more Renaissance-related areas, whereas more action-packed scenes have the typical but effective music that is similar to a good majority of shounen anime. The OP is also blood-pumping. I NEVER skip it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are either hit or miss. While I previously mentioned that  I loved the character designs, there were only a few that I actually ended up feeling really attached to. Shiroe is a pretty awesome protagonist. While he isn't necessarily creative in the \"guy with glasses makes witty and intelligent remarks while everyone oohs and ahhs\" area, his cunning and calculating nature makes for a very compelling protagonist. Nyanta is your typical badass, really nothing more to say there other than he's just a fun and wise character who is really enjoyable to watch. Krusty is pretty compelling too. And although this might be an unpopular opinion, I have enjoyed Marielle's character from the start. Her humor is extremely contagious and her bubbly persona is very endearing and charming.\\n\\n\r\nIf I didn't mention a character, it's because I either didn't care for them or didn't remember them. I don't mind Naotsugu's goofiness, but he just isn't memorable despite being a protagonist. Akatsuki's character is honestly just disappointing. She's supposedly a powerful high-level ninja, but you rarely ever see that considering she serves as Henrietta's dress-up loli doll for eighty percent of the plot. I don't mind Henrietta either, but her obsession with Akatsuki was unneeded and annoying. Rundellhous was pretty cool too, but similar to Naotsugu, he didn't really leave an impression on me. (Although there is a pretty great plot twist involving him that I won't spoil).\\n\r\nAnother issue that I had is a good chunk of the characters are already high-level players, giving little room for any meaningful character development. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the story, the primary reason that I wrote this review in the first place. I already mentioned it, but I've dropped this series multiple times for one reason; it's simply just a boring show. While it follows a similar plot to SAO with players being trapped in a video game, the danger isn't there. In SAO, you die in game, you die IRL. In Log Horizon, nothing happens to you aside from respawning and losing any items or money that you weren't smart enough to store (unless you're an NPC, in which case you are unfortunately \"all-dead\"). This effectively eliminates any real danger. This also plays into the conflict of when a character is \"in danger.\" I can't understand how there is any real danger to begin with when the worst that can happen is you is losing your items. This lack of danger also plays into the severe lack of a conflict. Multiple times I've been told \"it gets better the longer you've watched it.\" Eighteen episodes in, and there has been close to no central conflict that poses the characters. You could say \"Well, you haven't watched all of it, so how would you know?\" For all I know, there is a very good chance that the plot picks up towards the end of the series, but therein lies the problem. It shouldn't take this long for a compelling conflict to be established. \\n\\n\r\nIf this show was advertised as a \"slice of life\", I think I'd be less harsh on it. But no, Log Horizon is not a slice of life at all. No where will you find anything that suggests Log Horizon is even remotely a slice of life. \"Action\" and \"Adventure\" are two of the genres listed, despite both being, for the most part, absent for a good majority of the show's run. I usually have no problem with slices of life, since going into it, I KNOW that the plot and story are not as important as the characters. This is why I enjoyed \"Miss Kobyashi's Dragon Maid\" and \"Sakamoto desu ga?\" because going into them, I knew that neither would have a concrete plot considering they were slices of life, and I enjoyed both for their charm and how their characters interacted. This show plays out as a slice of life for a good half of the run, focusing less on the actual plot, and more about how the characters adapt to their new world, but again, that's NOT what this genre is.\\n\\n\r\nAnother minor gripe I have is that the language of the show is pretty bizarre. You have a character in the first few or so episodes saying \"We're gonna kick your ass\", to Akatsuki calling Naotsugu the very childish insult, \"turd\". I mean it's very clearly not a kid's show, so why the creators thought it was necessary to use such childish language was beyond me.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I DON'T dislike Log Horizon, but my expectations (I guess that's partly my fault) of what the show was meant to be were not met in the slightest. I'd find myself falling asleep at certain episodes because of how devoid of an interesting conflict they were. As I previously mentioned, SAO is NOT perfect at all, but in terms of world-building and the presence of a conflict and plot, it absolutely dominates Log Horizon and drives it into the pixelated ground.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure if I watch a bit more, my opinion might change, but for now, I'm not going to waste investing my time in it.",

            "content": "This is an MMORPG oriented anime at heart, but as it goes on it diverges quite a bit. It starts off going very in depth into MMO mechanics, especially those related to team work. There's a very strong tactical edge to everything that happens, which makes sense as the main character is a well known strategist. There's a lot of clever use and abuse of various mechanics to accomplish various objectives. There's a dichotomy of having two stories running side by side, one involving high leveled players that are experts on the game and are dealing with things at a high scale and one involvinglow leveled players learning how the game functions from the basics, thus giving the viewers a look into both aspects. However, as it goes on the MMO mechanics begin to matter less and less. This is in part because as it goes on, it becomes clear the world is very different from Elder Tale, and rather than being virtual, it becomes more and more evident that it is an actual world, or at least that's what it seems, which is a very interesting twist on how such stories normally go. The stories still stay focused around tactics, mechanics, and increasingly politics, as opposed to action, though the stories resemble more stories that would take place in a real world than an MMO. Overall, these stories were incredibly good, in that they were interesting stories in their own right and they also developed the world quite well, though the last story felt like a weak plot to close the anime on. However, there was an issue in that it felt like there was never much danger, in that death, even after revealing its consequence, never seemed to matter. Still, watching Shiroe pull out crazy plans out of nowhere and watch them execute tremendously well was incredibly satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters, to the point its pretty hard to choose who the main characters would be. Shiroe would definitely be the key main character, and he is an incredibly awesome one, but beyond that there are over a dozen characters that feel like they have the same importance and get the same amount of development. The end result of this is that while Shiroe ends up getting some solid development, as do his relationship with others, with the exception of Crusty and Princess\u00a0Corwen, pretty much everyone's elses's characters and relationships felt kind of underdeveloped. There is quite a variety in the cast of characters that are all used quite well and they are quite likable in the time they're given however.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation felt noticeably low budget. I generally don't mind, and even here I didn't mind much, but it was incredibly obvious. The soundtrack was decent but forgettable. The OP was great. The ED was solid.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime that features an incredible tactician in an MMO pulling off amazing plans, however somewhat lacking in terms of character development and production values.\\n\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "~DISCLAIMER~\r\nI would like to formally say that this is my first review ever, and although I don't think it should make my points any less credible it is a fact that you, the reader, should know.\r\nAlso, I haven't seen the second season of Log Horizon, and I'm not sure if I ever will.\r\n~OVERVIEW~\r\nI wanted to really like Log Horizon. Like seriously. When I started this I really hated Sword Art Online, but by the end of it I ended up rewatching a bit of SAO and coming to gradually like SAO. Log Horizon is kind of plain boring. It brings very little things new tothe table and goes about it slowly, making it almost feel like a SoL. Its pacing is painfully slow, and a lot of arcs could've taken a lot less episodes, which could've fit in a lot more content.\\n\\n\r\n~STORY~ (minor spoilers)\\n\r\nLog Horizon is like your friend who was way too into Steven Universe and liked to express that by shoving the entire storyline of the episode he rewatched last night and why it is so deep and a commentary on our society, and this and that and blah blah blah (so sorry SU fans, I know a lot of you are pretty cool people. Don't worry, the person I'm talking about is actually me 3 years ago).\\n\r\nLog Horizon finds great pleasure in exploring its world's politics, but has hard time getting you to care about it too. The truly largest problem that the group faces is dealt with off the screen, and instead they show you the importance of a character who (looks and acts exactly like Guiche from Zero no Tsukaima) I find pretty annoying and is only used as an outlet to show off a strong and important concept to the show that is used only once and only talked about after. The ending to the show I find very unsatisfying. The situation that they deal with is \"Oh no they're being completed asses and making our festival somewhat chaotic. This must be some dastardly plan to make us look bad and interfere with our relationship with the King!\" To counter this, they employ a strange strategy that realistically would not work or be efficient. The perpetrator is has another boring plan. He basically lies, forces the cast to make a minor mistake, and everyone finds it so extreme that it will mess with political affairs. Then he acts like a dick for like, ten minutes. When they call him on his bluff thinking that they're geniuses, the perp storms off in panic mode when the teacher finds out his dog didn't really eat his homework.\\n\\n\r\n(um bigger spoilers i guess.)\\n\r\nI would also like to talk about the pacing once more. It is really painstakingly slow. The arc where the cast is residing in the Eastal Castle of whatyoumacallit lasted a whole ten episodes. It could've been sped up entirely, but the show sliced half of those episodes to develop side characters that I could care less about. The entire development really was Minori finally decided to not be shy and Rudy becomes slightly less annoying and arrogant.\\n\\n\r\n(edit+big spoilers. Like seriously, skip this if you haven't watched the anime/)\\n\r\nI forgot to mention this, but I feel the writers screwed up when they wrote in the \"you lose memories if you die\" concept. They eliminated the consequence of death early, so they should've just rolled with that and created a more chill story, almost SoL (but thats just my take.)\\n\r\nThe consequence they came up with feels like \\n\r\n\"Oh I want there to be a consequence to dying.\"\\n\r\n\"Why?\"\\n\r\n\"Because we need people to care.\"\\n\r\n\"So, how about we make them lose memories?\"\\n\r\n\"Thats great! Let's just make it so tiny that it won't really matter, but have the characters act like the world is ending!\"\\n\r\n\"Why?\"\\n\r\n\"It's not like we're actually gonna write bad outcomes or consequences in of course. Are you stupid?\"\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\r\nThe art is nothing to be proud of. A lot of the colors just awkwardly mesh together. The color palette is really bland, which contrasts a lot of the vibrant things in this anime. Also, I find the UI for the game commands to be very busy, and unappealing. I don't plan on mentioning other anime much in my reviews, but SAO is a a good comparison to this. Although I find its characters hollow and its story leaving much to be desired, you have to give it credit for its art. Everything is pops out and really gives off the game aesthetic. The game UI is very clean and easy for the viewer to interpret. Log Horizon feels like an art project where you lost all your good pencil crayons and were forced to color it in with your bad ones. The character designs reflect their character as a whole. And that is basic, clich\u00e9, and boring.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTER~\\n\r\nI see three groups of people in Log Horizon. The adult crew, the kid crew, and the side characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe adult crew consists of Akatsuki, Naotsugu, Nyanta, Serara, and Shiroe. They follow a lot for stereotypes which leads me to believe that these characters were made to be loved instead of to play a part in the story. And I'm probably right. The assassin-shy love interest girl, the outgoing-pervert who says a lot of pointless things that could've been funnier if written differently, the cool swordsman-cat person, and the little girl who's in love awwwhhhh. Shiroe is the only one who is intriguing.  He approaches the world he's been trapped in a different way from anyone else and even the tradition, real life gamer. He's able to think 5 steps ahead and come up with unique and solid plans. However, thats as far as it goes.\\n\\n\r\nThe kid crew should be obvious if you've watched the anime. Without wasting time, I'll quickly boil them down in even simpler sentences. The upbeat brother, the shy sister, the regular girl, and the arrogant *cough* Guiche *cough* guy.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that at least one side character should be interesting enough to almost have their own spin off show, but a lot of these characters in Log Horizon fall short. Marielle and Henrietta complete the \"one who doesn't want to work-person who makes them work\" combo. Henrietta does have her moments though. Krusty is just the skilled, smart, cool guy, who I actually deem somewhat important to represent an actual gamer and make the story so be it, a bit more fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL THOUGHTS~\\n\r\nLog Horizon could be better if it revised its cast and story just a bit more. The anime's main problems lie in the fact that the characters are bland, the story is boring, and the conflicts aren't engaging. Again, I haven't seen season two, but I hope that they do realize this then. None of the other characters stand out at all.\\n\\n\r\nI give Log Horizon a 6.5/10.\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review.",

            "content": "Log Horizon is actually the first show I ever watched that's built around the concept of being stuck inside a game, preferably an MMORPG. It's certainly not the first fantasy show I've watched, and also not one that's based on a certain game (which Log Horizon isn't), but I'm just throwing this out here anyway, mostly because at first, Log Horizon was inevitably compared to similar \"stuck in the game\" shows like dot Hack or Sword Art Online. I throw this out now, so that you won't wonder why I won't compare Log Horizon to either of them -- I simply have no basis forcomparison outside of some minor information about either of the two.\\n\\n\r\nThis might also be why Log Horizon chooses to dispense with the \"if you die in the game, you die for real\" angle in the first episode; it simply isn't happening. Characters who fall in battle simply revive in a chapel, seemingly no worse for wear. In its place, we're pretty much served the mystery of how everyone ended up living inside a game, because nobody among the main characters know, and, naturally, panic and confusion spread among the captured players, each choosing to deal with that in their own way, whether that be flaunting guild influence or resorting to stalking and PKing.\\n\r\nIn this world, Shiroe actually represents something of a rising trend in anime; the intelligent, resourceful male lead who doesn't just rush in without a second thought, expecting everything to just sort itself out if they just believe hard enough. Granted, I'm taking all the technobabble and \"strategy\" in this show with a pinch of salt, but he still gets the benefit of the doubt simply because he considers his options before doing things. Problems and its solutions aren't always a simple matter of just beating through them with whatever weapons he has at hand. The show reveals him to be a college graduate, which at least lends some credence to his level of intelligence... as presented by the series.\\n\r\nThe idiot role is mostly filled by Naotsugu. Not as much because he's incapable -- he's a level 90 character, like many others among the main cast -- but because he tends to be the butt of most of the jokes. During much of the beginning, he's liable to say something perverted, which earns himself a knee or a foot to the face from Akatsuki, the third part of our main trio. Akatsuki is actually a bit of a curiosity, because the first time you see the character, you see a fairly tall male assassin character... that speaks with a female voice. Having played with their team before, she simply didn't really speak a whole lot, if at all, so when their residence in the game turns somewhat permanent, the first thing she does is to request an appearance-changing potion from Shiroe. Like Shiroe and Naotsugu, she's a level 90 character, meaning she's easily as capable as the others, but since her voice would have been an obvious giveaway, she never really joined any guilds or groups for long amounts of time. So let it be no slight on her capabilities as a player (or assassin, as the situation stands) when I say her female form is downright adorable. It's also relatively short, so of course they had to make a joke about how surprising it was when she revealed she was at least as old as Shiroe. She is one of the most prominent of the female characters, which does say a little about the female characters in this show; they tend to become victims, joke vessels or relegated to support role. It's a bit ironic, given that the main character in this show has chosen a gamer class that's solely a support class, yet still manages to steal the limelight more often than not, even in battle. Even as the most capable of the female characters, Akatsuki still swears allegiance to Shiroe, even if it's to repay him for giving her a very valuable item. She doesn't necessarily adapt a completely servile personality style, though, so take that as you will.\\n\r\nCuriously enough, Log Horizon also has one of the few cat GUYS I've seen in anime. Beast races are apparently not entirely uncommon in Eldar Tale, so Log Horizon gives us Nyanta, another old ally of Debauchery Tea Party and also stuck in the game with the rest of them. Funnily enough, he actually carries the most common hallmark of catgirl behavior -- working in the word \"nya\" into his conversations -- but that ended up being surprisingly easy to get used to. Nyanta is possibly one of the older players in Elder Tale -- and Log Horizon by extension -- and another members of the \"intelligence and maturity over guts\" lineup of appealing characters.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps not unwisely, the players in Akihabara -- seriously, that's the town in the game they appear in; a home base of sorts -- decide to settle in as soon as possible before any other actions can be taken, something that doesn't go entirely smoothly. Once past the prerequisite character introduction and world presentation episodes, the show immediately goes off on a rescue mission. Aside from the aforementioned potion, which is apparently a very rare items in Elder Tale, Shiro and Naotsugu seemingly owns a lot of rare items, presumably from the time the two spent in a kind of freelance group called \"Debauchery Tea Party\", an adventuring group with people who had no interest in creating a guild. But even beyond that, there's the minor problem of PKers, and the somewhat bigger problems of low-level characters being headhunted into guilds that end up taking advantage of them in downright slavery-like ways. As viewers, we also have to contend with a lot of tutorials in how the game of Elder Tale works, or just MMORPGs in general, and for people who already know most of this, it can get pretty aggravating after a while.\\n\r\nThe show eventually moves on from that, thankfully, and it goes through quite a few plot arcs within its runtime of 25 episodes. In a sense, that is also Log Horizon's greatest weakness, because you never really get a good feel of what the show is about. You'd think it would be about what happened with Elder Tale and how so many people literally got stuck inside of it, unable to log out, but past the initial panic attack, people seem strangely unconcerned with it. In fact, just about everyone is a little bit too keen on becoming a permanent part of the new Elder Tale, even though nobody really knows what's going on back in the real world. Are their bodies still there? Will their continued presence in Elder Tale negatively affect said bodies? In short, what is going on? But while dying in the game doesn't seem to affect anyone in any significant way, it might have some other unfortunate side effects that will make themselves more apparent over time.\\n\r\nThe other big mystery hanging over the whole gaming world of Log Horizon is its character cast, aka the NPCs. In the game before the apocalypse, most of them were of the simple \"I like Swords\" variety, but now that everyone is living inside Elder Tale, all the \"people of the land\" seems to have gotten a serious personality upgrade, to the point that they're almost completely indistinguishable from the heroes (aka \"the adventurers\".) One of the subplots actually revolve around said NPCs approaching the heroes with diplomatic (and some secretive) designs on their minds. Their new personality upgrade also comes with the added problem of their deaths being quite permanent, which also becomes somewhat of an issue later on.\\n\\n\r\nFragmented story progression aside, Log Horizon has this offbeat quality to it that I rather like. Even though it's heavily steeped in MMORPGisms, I can always get behind a good fantasy with various facets of its world building to its name, and despite the fact that the players in Elder Tale takes to the ultimate in virtual reality concerning RPGs -- which I'm sure a lot of gamers have had fantasies about -- it's both complex and compelling enough to remain interesting through its entire runtime. Some of the later plot lines kind of feels like they're being abandoned, but a second season was announced about the time the first finished, so it doesn't feel quite as much as a copout as it would have been, had this been the sole season available. As it is, I'm looking forward to the second season. There are still so many things here I want to know.",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\n\"Great, another anime about people getting caught up in the virtual world of a video game, how original.\" This was my first thought when I read the synopsis of \"Log Horizon\" and it was obviously loaded with a mixture of irony and boredom. Luckily something clicked on me and I decided to give it a try despite the unflattering initial premise. And I say luckily because it was a pleasant surprise finally. In another boast of originality, but this time for my part, during the review I will make different comparisons with \"SAO\" (never seen, right?). Basically I'm going to dothis because for some reason that I can't understand, \"SAO\" is the flagship in terms of popularity (not quality, no, because it's mediocre to puke) of this sub-genre and I think it's a good yardstick to compare two products with similar backgrounds. If you're passionate about Kazuto's (and company) insufferable firecracker anime you'd better stop reading here, because as I already did in his own review, I'm going to put it back in the broth in the mentions, which is what he deserves.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, one of the most remarkable things about \"Log Horizon\" is that it reflects perfectly what routine would be like in a virtual world in which people from the real world have become trapped (within the possibilities, as this is obviously speculation). From the initial confusion, through a process of depression and criminality, until people begin to organize themselves in order to prosper, although with a multitude of conflicts and clashes along the way, of course. Pure human nature. The great achievement is to teach us this from a global perspective. Obviously there is a protagonist and there are main characters, but at all times we can observe the evolution that has taken place as a unit, the way in which the \"world\" of the game grows and changes. This is appreciated because it offers a great backdrop and helps a lot to create an environment in which the audience is able to immerse themselves. Although it has an eminently fantastic theme, everything feels real, true in \"Log Horizon\". In contrast to \"SAO\", where everything is centred on the children of a couple of insubstantials and everything else around them is relegated to such a secondary plane that it is not credible.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, even without being a wonder or anything that will mark a before and after in the history of anime, is interesting and flows at a good pace, without peaks but without downturns, constant in quality and interest. It is worth noting that despite having a main plot where most of the storyline is based, different sub-plots are gradually being incorporated that give a great deal of variety to the development and that sometimes represent a respite between combats, alliances and meetings. In this sense it is also appreciated that from time to time there is a funny, comical tone, since having that touch also helps that diversity and makes the story much more enjoyable. A good mix of serious tone and carefree tone is difficult to achieve, but if done correctly it is a great success and \"Log Horizon\" does it. This is much better than simply being a story with great potential, but nurtured by a horrific development and taking itself too seriously (does it ring any bells?).\\n\\n\r\nAnother of the strengths of the anime, probably the most important, are the characters. The number is quite high, but even so they all have a strong personality and at no time give the impression that they are for simple stuffing. On the other hand, the protagonist is not the typical jerk of this kind of story. It is true that he may sin to be so great in \"his own\" (strategic combat and planning), but he does not have that aura of false perfection that is so hard to believe. He has weaknesses and vulnerabilities, as he acknowledges in the series. In that sense I appreciate it, because few things are more annoying to me than a protagonist who does everything right, is perfect and does not fail in anything, everyone loves and admires him... Unsufferable. Anyway, as I have already mentioned, Shiroe is not the only good character in \"Log Horizon\". I could name Akatsuki, Naotsugu, Minori, Henrietta... all characters very different from each other and who pack the story in their own way. The only thing that squeaks at me (and too much even to make my personal impression worse) is that ambiguity about the romantic-loving subject involving characters like Minori or even Serara, who are underage, childs directly. There is nothing explicit, it cannot even be considered \"serious\", but they play with a kind of confusion and double meanings that are not acceptable. Seriously, that's completely superfluous.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the technical section, artistically it is more than enough. Well-drawn scenarios, surprising effects and magic. You can't ask for a single but, because the medieval-fantastic atmosphere is perfectly recreated. As for the sound section, the melodies sound very, very good, they have more than acceptable quality. Some of them would sound in any JRPG. The opening is horrible and completely anticlimactic, it doesn't fit in with the style and theme of \"Log Horizon\". Lousy choice. The ending, however, is very, very good, with it they have been right. By the way, it is precisely in the case of opening that the overvalued \"SAO\" will hardly outperform \"Log Horizon\". Because in \"SAO\" the opening is an absolute geniality interpreted by LiSA and that is difficult to overcome it. To conclude, I applaud the fact that in \"Log Horizon\" they have used only one opening/ending all season. This is what all studios should do in these seasons of just over 20 chapters. People, with only one opening/ending is more than enough in so few chapters, because it helps to create an identity and an identification with the anime, something that gets complicated if you start to put different openings/endings in a short time. If bands want to promote themselves, they could make videos on Youtube, but it's dantesque to see things like three openings in a season of 20 and few chapters (cof, cof, \"Code Geass\").\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\n\"Genial, otro anime sobre gente que se queda atrapada en el mundo virtual de un videojuego, qu\u00e9 original\". Este fue mi primer pensamiento cuando le\u00ed la sinopsis de \"Log Horizon\" por primera vez y obviamente estaba cargado de una mezcla entre iron\u00eda y hast\u00edo. Por suerte algo me hizo click y decid\u00ed darle una oportunidad a pesar de lo poco halag\u00fce\u00f1o de la premisa inicial. Y digo por suerte porque ha sido una agradable sorpresa. En otro alarde de originalidad, pero esta vez por mi parte, durante la cr\u00edtica voy a establecer diferentes comparaciones con \"SAO\" (nunca visto, \u00bfverdad?). B\u00e1sicamente voy a hacer esto porque por alguna raz\u00f3n que no alcanzo a entender, \"SAO\" es el buque insignia en cuanto a popularidad (en cuanto a calidad no, porque es mediocre hasta vomitar) de este subg\u00e9nero y creo que es una buena vara de medir el comparar dos productos con similar trasfondo. Si te apasiona el anime del petardo insufrible de Kazuto (y compa\u00f1\u00eda) ser\u00e1 mejor que dejes de leer aqu\u00ed, porque como ya hiciera en su review propia, voy a volver a ponerla a caldo en las menciones que haga, que es lo que merece.\\n\\n\r\nDe primeras una de las cosas m\u00e1s destacables de \"Log Horizon\" es que plasma perfectamente c\u00f3mo ser\u00eda la rutina en un mundo virtual en el que gente del mundo real ha quedado atrapada (dentro de las posibilidades, ya que obviamente son especulaciones). Desde la confusi\u00f3n inicial, pasando por un proceso de depresi\u00f3n y criminalidad, hasta que la gente empieza a organizarse para conseguir prosperar, aunque con multitud de conflictos y choques en el camino, por supuesto. Pura naturaleza humana. El gran acierto es ense\u00f1arnos esto desde una perspectiva global. Obviamente hay un protagonista, hay personajes principales, pero en todo momento podemos observar la evoluci\u00f3n que se ha producido en conjunto, el c\u00f3mo \"el mundo\" del juego crece y cambia. Esto es algo que se agradece porque ofrece un gran trasfondo y ayuda much\u00edsimo a crear un ambiente en el que el espectador sea capaz de sumergirse. A pesar de tener una tem\u00e1tica eminentemente fant\u00e1stica todo se siente real, verdadero en \"Log Horizon\". Al contrario que ocurre en \"SAO\", donde todo est\u00e1 centrado en las ni\u00f1atadas de un par de insustanciales y lo que hay alrededor queda relegado a un plano tan secundario que hace que no sea cre\u00edble (a pesar de los majestuosos y espectaculares escenarios, que en eso es genial).\\n\\n\r\nLa historia, a\u00fan sin ser un portento ni nada que vaya a marcar un antes y un despu\u00e9s en la historia del anime, es interesante y va fluyendo a buen ritmo, sin picos pero sin bajones, constante en calidad y en inter\u00e9s. Es un punto a destacar que a pesar de tener una trama principal donde se sustenta la mayor parte del peso argumental, se van incorporando poco a poco diferentes subtramas que le dan bastante variedad al desarrollo y que a veces suponen un respiro entre combates, alianzas y reuniones. En este sentido se agradece tambi\u00e9n que de vez en cuando haya un tono divertido, c\u00f3mico, ya que contar con ese toque ayuda tambi\u00e9n a esa diversidad y hace mucho m\u00e1s agradable la historia. Una buena mezcla entre lo serio y lo desenfadado es dif\u00edcil de realizar, pero si se lleva a cabo correctamente es un gran acierto y en \"Log Horizon\" ocurre as\u00ed. Mucho mejor esto que ser simplemente una historia con gran potencial, pero que naufrada con un desarrollo horroroso y por tomarse demasiado en serio a s\u00ed misma (\u00bfos suena de algo?).\\n\\n\r\nOtro de los puntos fuertes del anime, probablemente el que m\u00e1s, son los personajes. El n\u00famero es bastante elevado, pero aun as\u00ed todos cuentan con una personalidad bastante marcada y en ning\u00fan momento dan la sensaci\u00f3n de que est\u00e9n para simple relleno. Por otra parte, el protagonista no es el t\u00edpico pelmazo que abunda en este tipo de historias. Es cierto que puede pecar de ser \"un hacha\" en lo suyo (combate estrat\u00e9gico y planificaci\u00f3n), pero no tiene ese aura de falsa perfecci\u00f3n tan dif\u00edcil de creer. Tiene sus debilidades y sus puntos flacos, \u00e9l mismo lo reconoce en la propia serie. En ese sentido yo lo agradezco, porque pocas cosas se me hacen m\u00e1s co\u00f1azo que ese protagonista al que todo le sale bien, es perfecto y no falla en nada, todo el mundo le quiere y admira... Insufrible. De todas formas, como ya he comentado, Shiroe no es el \u00fanico buen personaje de \"Log Horizon\". Podr\u00eda nombrar a Akatsuki, Naotsugu, Minori, Henrietta... todos personajes muy diferentes entre s\u00ed y que dan empaque a la historia cada uno a su forma. Lo \u00fanico que me chirr\u00eda (y adem\u00e1s much\u00edsimo, tanto como para empeorar mi impresi\u00f3n personal) es esa ambig\u00fcedad al respecto del tema rom\u00e1ntico-amoroso implicando a personajes como Minori o incluso Serara, que son menores de edad, ni\u00f1as directamente. No hay nada expl\u00edcito, ni siquiera se puede considerar \"serio\", pero juegan con una especie de confusiones y dobles sentidos que no son de recibo. En serio, eso sobra por completo.\\n\\n\r\nEn cuanto al apartado t\u00e9cnico, art\u00edsticamente cumple con creces. Escenarios bien dibujados, efectos y magias que sorprenden. No se le puede pedir ni un pero, porque la atm\u00f3sfera fant\u00e1stico-medieval est\u00e1 recreada a la perfecci\u00f3n. En cuanto al apartado sonoro, las melod\u00edas suenan muy, muy bien, son de una calidad m\u00e1s que aceptable. Algunas dar\u00edan el pego en cualquier JRPG que se precie. Aunque no puedo dejar de comentar que el opening es horrible y completamente anticlim\u00e1tico, no cuadra lo m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo con el estilo y la tem\u00e1tica de \"Log Horizon\". P\u00e9sima elecci\u00f3n. El ending sin embargo es muy, muy bueno, con \u00e9l s\u00ed han acertado de pleno. Por cierto, precisamente en esto del opening ser\u00eda en lo poco que la sobrevalorada \"SAO\" supere a \"Log Horizon\". Y es que en \"SAO\" el opening es una genialidad absoluta interpretada por LiSA y eso es complicado de superar. Para terminar dir\u00e9 que aplaudo a rabiar que en \"Log Horizon\" hayan usado un solo opening/ending en toda la temporada. Es lo que deberian hacer todos los estudios en estas temporadas de poco m\u00e1s de 20 cap\u00edtulos. Se\u00f1ores, con un opening/ending es m\u00e1s que suficiente en tan pocos cap\u00edtulos, ya que gracias a ello se consigue una identidad propia y una identificaci\u00f3n del mismo con el anime, algo que se complica si empiezas a meter diferentes openings/endings en poco tiempo. Si los grupos musicales se quieren promocionar que hagan v\u00eddeos en Youtube, pero es dantesco ver cosas como tres openings en una temporada de 20 y pocos cap\u00edtulos (cof, cof, \"Code Geass\").",

There is no weight to the story - players are immortal, there is nothing to loose. Yes - death removes a bit of memories, but we see Shiro die over and over again later in series and there is no negative effect, like it is forgotten at all. There is no real drive to care for the pleople of the land - they are NPCs, yes they take up maintenance of town, but players can do it just fine too,as we are shown that quite early in the story. Living is dirty cheap, only drawback tastless food, but it means as long as you kill atleast a couple of monster, you can go by just fine living in inn, as well as buying food. So... What should we care about in anime, where MC and his guild are immortal, can go by without dying, because normal monster and even armies of monsters are too weak to threaten them? There are to stakes there, characters are 2d in every possible way. Shiro is smart, Cat is good chef and womanizer, paladin is perv, ninja is tsundere - all you will get out of the main cast. If you want somewhat decent stuck in a game anime go watch SAO, or hack// series, atleast there is something to be lost if they die.",

Overall it was a great show and i can't wait to read the manga",

The would be Players our main character Shiroe must adapt to this new land, level up, and get loot drops. \r\nArt:\r\nGeneric 2010s anime art style, with a wide variety in the color pallet.\r\nSound:\r\nMonsters, sword clashes, and things falling all sound decent. The Dub is also well done and no characters voice seems out of place.\r\nCharacters: We have three starkly different characters team up\r\nShiroe - Basically the laid back genius (like shikamaru from naruto)He seems to always be thinking one step ahead of everyone else. He extremely skilled and when he needs to be a great manipulator, thus the reason he was nicknamed \"The Villian in Glasses\" (also he's a Enchanter)\\n\\n\r\nNaotsugu - The Meat head, he's a very happy go lucky kind of dude. He has a habbit of making some good natured dirty jokes, and cheering up his friends. (He's the Tank)\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki - Then we have this girl the wannabe Ninja(though she actaully is a Assassin class)Originally she played as a guy character as to not be noticed but when the update happened she ended up in a weird situation and thanks to Shiroe was able to be a girl. She has pledged her loyalty to him since, (aint that cute) only addressing him a \"My Lord\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThough Log Horizon doesnt bring anything new to the table. It's fun to see how the players evolve from people being stranded in a new world to hard working members of the community. With Shiroe at the forefront to lead them all, whether they want to follow or not. At times this Anime is very light hearted(like pokemon) and others its almost like a mind game(like Classroom of the Elites) or political war.(like Gate)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis animes fun to watch and decently interesting. While you may not feel for the character you come to like them(or atleast one of them hopefully)",

Revolves around the virtual world and gaming; so if you are not playing MMORPGs or other online games, or if you aren\u2019t into gaming in general, I think that it might take you longer to catch up with what is going on in this anime.  However, it does not mean that you would not be able to enjoy it.  This anime contains bits of romance,tons of comedy, and a lot of adventure; so it would be fit for any anime viewer that has an open mind and a general view about the anime world.  When you finish this anime, you\u2019ll want to watch more and learn about its story after the ending. \\n\r\nThe story mainly revolves around the fact that the main characters perform a great job while being in a different world.  Shiroe, the main character, is someone that is very cunning, strong-willed and is also a great strategist-characteristics fit for a leader especially in MMORPGs. Despite his \u201cclass\u201d in the game, he leads his people (other players closely-related to him) to achieve great things.\\n\r\nThe hook in this anime is that the characters are stuck in a game without any way to get out of it.  Shiro makes the world interesting by bringing back the players into the mood of being able to \u201clive normal\u201d again. (Watched early 2015)\\n",

The concepts and execution of those concepts are very well fleshed out and intelligent. It's not just a competent story, it's a great story. The directing is flat and boring, with only the most engaging moments in the story actually effective in their presentation. The comedy, with very few exceptions, is one joke assigned to a character that makes you smile slightly the first time it happens, and then this joke repeated with no variation over and over.\r\nI can off handedly remember about15 moments in the entire season that were actually effectively directed in a way that I'd enjoy watching again, and one really great scene that was very well directed and enjoyable to watch. Every time I try to think about an episode that I've already watched, I remember how dull the execution is and don't feel like rewatching it. The story is great, but since I already know how it plays out, actually watching the show again does not entice me at all.",

            "content": "This is a story about people trapped in an MMORPG with classes and sub classes, it has people who are animal hybrids and how they deal with it. Very familiar right? But it's not exactly like those\r\nIf I had to describe Log Horizon and what makes it different from SAO and the .hack//sign I'd use the example of :Id, Ego and SuperEgo.\r\n-SAO is the Id, unrestrained and rather messy at points, focusing on the flash sometimes over the substance beneath. Watching it is the equal to watching a fun but predictable movie like Wonder Woman or Iron man.\r\n-.Hack//sign is the Ego, something more thoughtful butalso still emotionally driven, in some ways this is emotionally the deepest that leaves us thinking about it's implications and emotions involved after we've stopped watching. I'd compare watching it to something like Memento or Green Mile .\\n\\n\r\n-Making Log Horizon the Superego, a look at how to perfect the ideas and distill them into a formula that can be influenced and subverted using the rules of the world. In movie terms The Usual Suspects and the Game, things that keep you in amazement how they pulled it off even 10 minutes or 10 days after turn it off.\\n\\n\r\nNow with that said: \\n\r\nLog Horizon is all about a strategist and if you like \"thinking\" anime like Death Note but do want a bit more action this will definitely scratch that itch as it did for me. Almost every attack done by the characters in action scenes who ally themselves with Shiroe, the main character, are done with a purpose that becomes clear even if it's not immediate. And every time the camera zooms in on something or the shot lingers on something during a conversation IT IS IMPORTANT even if you don't think it is at the moment. There are several early bird cameos that you can catch that way of characters who don't appear in talking roles for another 2 or 3 episodes. So in that way I'd have give it a 10/10 in terms of story telling because it's clear the creators and animation company didn't want to waste a moment of screen time and wanted to respect our time as viewers by giving us a full story.\\n\\n\r\nNow All the characters who we meet are also very much nerdy people as this was based around an MMO that they really ddid play, so even the 'dumb' characters have some brain about them. However this doesn't keep them from becoming cliches/sterotypes in their own way including the wise but laidback master character, the perverted best friend (think Ryuji & Yosuke from persona), the loyal female character who is clearly in love with the the lead and even the cute young guy who is something of a ladies man. Due to their intelligence and how they're used to advance the plot which elevates them from being stock anime character # 31238 I give characters a 7/10 . \\n\\n\r\nThe sound an art design are well done but clearly not top notch for animes of this style. Shiroe who wears a giant white/off-white cape that has a red and dark grey pin makes him visually stick out but beside that he's the typical mage character and everyone else has the tropes of \"typical fantasy character\" and in Akatsuki's case, she wears what is now considered very typical ninja clothing for a fantasy setting. This is not a knock against the style though as it works for what was clearly suppose to an Everquest or FF11 type of fantasy MMORPG and even higher level gear sometimes gives off a generic feeling of a \"proper (insert class here)\" feel.  The expressions and details , especially in the backgrounds, is where this goes from a 5 to an 8 because they do not skimp out on making sure you get the expansiveness of a hallway or the city.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy it very much as I did like seeing a new wrinkle thrown into a genre I know well enough from anime and manga. I believe you owe it to yourself if you like less combat focused series with strategic mind set put forth very much. Just the cliches/character type  of the supporting cast, especially how some gags are repeated a lot in two nearly back to back episodes (One involving paperwork and another involving a character's seemingly platonic affection for Akatsuki, because of how cute she is) wore on my enjoyment a bit.\\n\\n\r\nI'd definitely say give it a few episodes, at least the first 3 to see if you are interested in going further. 9/10",

            "content": "Log Horizon is the story of a gamer named Shiroe and his friends after they are pulled into another world: a fantasy world that closely resembles the highly popular MMORPG, \"Elder Tale.\" For this review, I've chosen not to follow the trope of comparing it to Sword Art Online (or any other anime for that matter). As I watched, I wrote down my chief thoughts on the show as pros and cons. Since this is a MAL review, I've tried to rearrange the original bullet points into the following categories: Story (and Structure), Art, Sound, Character, and Personal Enjoyment.  \r\nStory and Structuring\r\n-Plot feels weakearly on. They should make a bigger point of the fact that the main characters are seeking meaning in their lives here in this new world. People seeking meaning, coming together, and creating things is the premise.\\n\r\n-Plot lacks sense of danger/epic feel because you just respawn when you die.\\n\r\n-Not many hints or foreshadowing to majot events, emphasis on shock surprise.\\n\r\n-The show is far too afraid to use character death. There are close calls, but in season one no major characters die. The characters are too strong, again making the show less epic than it could be with \"mortal\" characters.\\n\r\n-I felt that the fluff and goofy material in episodes 21-23 was a drag. Little of it was amusing. The plot came to a standstill. It's poor structuring to use 3 whole episodes of mostly fluff right before the two finale episodes. And of the two final episodes, the first was exceptionally boring. \\n\r\n-However, on occasion the feels really hit home. Even things that are frequently portrayed in anime are done in such a way to still feel sad/emotional. Example, Minori falling in love with Shiroe and being hurt by seeing him with Akatsuki. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\n-Animation looks rather cheap to me, but I am no artist, so please watch and judge for yourself. I also think sometimes, a few things are drawn just plain badly. Like the horses and some of the monsters. \\n\r\n-I was sad to see that the action sequences were only average quality. Nothing really \u201cawesome.\u201d\\n\r\n-Personal pet peeve: The characters have boring-looking eyes for being in an anime? \\n\r\n-There were certain scenes where things were implied to have happened, but they were not animated, and that felt cheap. Example Akatsuki and Shiroe dancing.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\n-The voice acting is pretty good. My favorites were: Kuno Misaki as Serara (who also played Niko in Kiznaiver), Nakata Jouji as Nyanta (he's had many roles but in my opinion was most memorable as Kotomine Kirei in the Fate series), Kakihara Tetsuya as Rundellhous (who apparently speaks English and German as well as Japanese), Daiki Yamashita as Touya (who later voiced Midorya in Boku no Hero Academia), Takahiro Sakurai as Krusty (he's been in tons of anime but I loved him most as Suzaku from Code Geass), and Nobuhiko Okamoto as side character Karashin (Rin from Ao no Exorcist).   \\n\\n\r\n-Catchy opening, \"Database\" by Man with a Mission (featuring Takuma)\\n\r\n-Catchy and pretty sounding ending song, \"Your Song\" by Yun*chi.\\n\r\n-I noticed some scores that used woodwinds or flutes and those were pretty.\\n\r\n-There are some good music scores for battle sequences, and a few that I noticed incorporated a little metal-- always a plus. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\n-Player Killer villains are not as evil because they're not really killing people.\\n\r\n-None of the characters seem very interested in finding out why they are trapped in game world, at least not at first. The level of disinterest is not believable for characters who were snatched away from the world they love.\\n\r\n-We have a very intelligent main character who is \"good\" without being preachy or cocky (well, sometimes he's a little arrogant, but that's anime guys for you).\\n\r\n-MC also has a \"villainous\" side, using deceit in his Crescent Moon plan.\\n\r\n-One of the three main characters is a girl who is rarely sexually objectified... except by Henrietta, but that's arguably not sexual at all. \\n\r\n-Main characters are college aged rather than high school, an unusual plus. \\n\r\n-Nyanta is a hilarious character especially since I mostly know his seiyuu Nakata Jouji for playing villainous characters, and suddenly here he's meowing. \\n\r\n-In addition to college aged main characters, there's also a team of young characters that are fun and relatable (Minori, Rudy, Isuzu, Tohya).\\n\r\n-The addition of another good female character, Lenessia, was a good move.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nBelow are several points that I thought needed to be said\u2014 they don't quite fit the other categories so I put them under Personal Enjoyment.  \\n\r\n-Log Horizon is an \"intelligent\" anime-- think of the Crescent Moon plan with all the strategy, principles of budgeting and economics, and business negotiations.\\n\r\n-Sometimes there are interesting questions of morality. Such as Shiroe forming an oligarchy, taking control of the city because he believes he's the best suited to govern, versus democracy, raising the question of Shiroe being \"evil\".   \\n\r\n-Eventually the secrets of the world start to be explained (ep 14)\\n\r\n-There's a nice variety of animal-people present including Shouryuu who is adorable in my opinion.\\n\r\n-I love most everything about the World lore. Examples are below. \\n\\n\r\n*Warning: Spoilers are Below* \\n\r\nNPCs are human: that is a fascinating idea. Incorporating real moves into fights along with commands: another good idea. The system of food and taste in the Log Horizon world. It's interesting that the world is a copy of the real world at half the scale. I like that they mention there are \"several hundred thousand\" players from other countries also trapped in game world. The function of the main Guild Building, with guilds unable to form or disband without being in the building, is creative. Another plus: the ability to invent modern things like steam engines. One of the best elements: a sort of \"science\" behind \"souls\" exists in this world, all the stuff about anima and psyche, and it's awesome. Finally, there is the awesome possibility of creating new magic like Shiroe did. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nWhile nothing astounding, Log Horizon is enjoyable and certainly deserves a place among anime of the \"Transported to fantasy world / game world\" genre. This isn't the best anime to watch high or drunk, since then it would be difficult to appreciate the intelligence of the main character and his plans. On the downside, the plot's a bit weak and poorly structured. On the plus side, the world lore is fascinating, and the characters are unforgettable.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Despite enjoying MMORPG \"VR-style\" anime as a genre I had put off watching Log Horizon (LH) as it came recommended with disclaimers that the show focused heavily on tactics and politics more so than the characters; or at least in comparison to its peers (such as SAO). For this reason i expected the show to be quite heavy and an investment to watch, but when i finally got around to watching it i didn't find it all that excessive on those elements and even managed to marathon the first season in only 4 evenings (the first 9 episodes in a single sitting). So i couldsummarise with that point alone that i quite enjoyed the show. Though that's not to say i found it flawless.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the show's substance comes from its reveals/plot twists so it's difficult to be any more than vague in my critiques in an effort to avoid spoilers. But i'll do my best.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing starts off very slow and picks up some speed after the mid-way point before a sudden information dump that occurs at the end, providing both some closure and pre-fixing the second season. The show was bordering on uncomfortably slow to develop at first (but that is i suppose half the process of creating suspense) before suddenly introducing a load of new lore relevant concepts in such number it's impossible to tell which will have any lasting focus in or on the plot. Some more thoughtful pacing would have worked wonders in consolidating which information was primary and which was secondary instead of having to absorb it in large chunks and process it on the fly. It may be possible to argue that this adds charm or personality to the show, but it really feels more like a wasted opportunity to create direction; the characters seemingly fumbling about for several episodes and arbitrarily finding direction after-the-fact seems to be a recurring and over used theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also has a habit of suggesting new characters, their strengths and importance that never actually make a real appearance or impact, whilst other support characters with barely any introduction wind up becoming more focal than first 3 characters we see and expect to play leading roles (Shiro literally plays a leading role, but you don't see him any more (in fact often less) than any other character after the opening arc). You could get away with this is the show was expected to run for as long as longer running shows like Naruto, Bleach or One Piece that reach several hundreds of episodes long, but neglecting character development in a 25-50 episode story is nothing short of an error in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good, even for a 2013 show. It probably wont blow you away, but i seriously doubt (besides one really strange episode where the artists must have been hungover or something) anyone could find any serious complaints with it. When the show has its flash backs to \"the real world\" however, the show really kicks it up a notch with the detail, which is super cool and it's nice to see the anime shift more towards its Asian heritage when depicting \"IRL\" Japan, than the white-washed kind of animation it [anime] now is.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs/profiles are a tad clich\u00e9, but then in a show about role playing i think that is inevitable, even unavoidable, since that is the nature of avatars. Though it does get worse to the point of abuse in the second series. But until then, the show is quite refined, but for the lack of proper individual development.\\n\\n\r\nWith the plot coming first, before the characters, its easy to see why the show has a reputation for not being concerned with juicy character relationships. Even when half the sub-plot is specifically about the relationship between players and NPC's. But this is simply what it would have taken, for me, to give the show a 10/10. 8/10 is still a high score and the show is certainly well worth watching.",

            "content": "Since all the reviews came for real fan lovers of the series, I guess I decided to leave a more neutral/objective one, I did enjoy the series but it\u2019s what I called \u201cwhen you don\u00b4t have anything else to watch\u201d , so pretty much is an average anime.  This review is for Season one and season 2, since season one didn\u2019t give a correct end, and obviously continues in season 2. \r\nLog horizon was recommended to me as a Real good anime based on a MMORPGs experienced, I was told \u201cis good not like SAO\u201d, since I really hate SAO, I thought wow Ifinally found a good MMORPGs inspired anime, I was wrong. Now, Log horizon is definitively better than SAO, but any anime is better than sao LOL \u2026 let me elaborate\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10)\\n\r\nAt the begging looks  so promising but the pacing was so slow and became something else so fast.  \\n\r\nWatching the anime you\u00b4ll realized of the huge amount of plot holes it has, there is no purpose, there is no reason, there is no bad guy whatsoever; you\u00b4ll see a bunch of people that are trapped in this game, that\u00b4s all. They are in a game platform but they decided to make a city, instead of exploring. The only realistic reaction was that gamers became a bit cruel and created a bit of chaos, but that was only in the begging, later on they were so happy and forgot everything and decided to go to all \u201cmatsuris\u201d they made in their new city/home.  I mean there is nothing bad in that but I didn\u00b4t see anyone complaining or being desperate trying to go home, they were just okay with the idea of being trapped, I\u2019m a gamer so I guess I will like it, but eventually I will be at least I BIT worried.  No one decides to explore for real just a guild leader (Legolas guy was the only one with a real good reaction when they made the round table). In other word I felt that most of the decisions or reactions, or just simple the Behavior was a bit unrealistic. \\n\\n\r\nI like that they explain the mechanics of the fights, the powers, the level, the types of characters , not like SAO (which I hate since kirito was the only one all-powerful gamer, I mean is a MMO game, the idea is team play, actually you can\u2019t defeat bosses by yourself)  the Team play was so cool, you have the healers, and the armor type, and the supports; it  was really good, that will be awesome if it wasn\u00b4t that fights appears every 15 slice of life episodes, yeah ! For me this was a slice of life anime. Also a cooking anime ._. They decide to make an entire episode of how to cook, and there is a bunch of episode of the girls making deserts and a cat making food.  \\n\\n\r\nPeople tend to blame you that you didn\u00b4t understand the plot when you get bored and want to skip tedious talking, I actually saw the whole thing without skipping anything, some conversation were political and interesting and some other were no sense, that all, with this anime some episodes were cool and other ones were completed unrelated and boring. For some reason I feel like the anime slowly became a loli harem slice of life cooking show.     \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (4/10) \\n\r\nI hate the fact that a cool really independent ninja girl became a helpless in love clich\u00e9 girl, she did also behave like a teen, when they clearly told that she was an adult like shiroe. She was even jealous of a little girl that for some reason supposed to be a teen, it doesn\u2019t matter both look like kids, apparently that is moe, I can\u00b4t stand lolis, they are so plain and boring MC , anywho at the begging character seem so   unique but I was wrong . there is no character development in here, no unique or strong characters, is more like stereotypical ones , the bunch of lolis, some huge breast girls, I cat that can cook and some guy which I couldn\u2019t understand, was he funny ? Was he just relaxed? Or he was just there to make Shirore look better? \\n\r\nShiroe was the only character that was interesting, cuz you know, he was the strategist. There was also another Megane guy but he didn\u00b4t appear that much and in the second season he literally was missed the whole thing until the end (why ? he was cool)  \\n\\n\r\nAnyhow empathy is missing and there is no real connection with the characters, most likely you will forget them.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound /enjoyment /overall (6/10) \\n\r\nThe animation is good, sound is good as well really like the OP and the second Ed. Enjoyment was good, the anime is not completely bad, sometimes is boring some other was cool(good fight/ elaborate plan team scenes).  Overall is an average anime, its okey when you don\u2019t have anything else to watch, most of episodes are fillers with no connection with the plot but are quite cute and I did like most of them. \\n",

            "content": "This anime was just all around great and one of the best I've seen in a long time, it's one of the few anime to actually suck me into its world and make me feel like I'm there right along side the characters. If you don't know about log horizon it's basically when thousands of people of undisclosed races all suddenly wake up in a game called elder tales, which is where we meet our protagonist (forgot his name at the moment) along with his best friends naotsuga and akatsuki. However though don't think this anime is anything like sword art online or .//hack, unlikeSAO and .//hack where all the people wanna know how to do is get they try and colonize they're world and adapt to it. They also utilized NPC's instead of making them an unimportant factor they made you realize the NPC's are no longer people sitting in one spot screaming things at you they're now real people with lives and emotions and families to protect. Also unlike anything else I've seen before if you die in log horizon you don't die for good you just respawn at the cathedral which in turn makes the players immortal, however though the anime doesn't lose it's suspense of when someone's in danger because..... Well that'll spoil to much you'll have to watch and see. Well this I my first review so I don't know if I wrote it well but this anime is a must watch the characters are easily likeable, the general theme is light hearted, it's sound track is memorable, the story is amazing, and it's highly enjoyable, overall it's just a damn good anime",

            "content": "In the near future, thirty thousand Japanese players of the hit MMORPG Elder Tale suddenly wake up and find that they have somehow been thrown into the game world with no clue how to leave. Soon named \u201cThe Apocalypse\u201d, this means that players have to learn new techniques and strategies to deal with the newfound reality, as opposed to looking at Elder Tale from a screen. Now, when first announced in the Fall Season, most people chalked it up to be another Sword Art Online clone, and never really gave it a fair chance. While it\u2019s true that Log Horizon takes place inside of aMMORPG, that\u2019s about where the comparison stops. Whereas SAO focused on the relationship between Kirito and Asuna, Log Horizon focuses on the socio-political effects of living in a new world. By this I mean that the MMORPG format almost takes a back seat to government. Log Horizon could easily take place in a fantasy setting with the characters trying to build a kingdom, as, though the action scenes were made well and interestingly, the real glow of Log Horizon is the depth of political strategy.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon focuses mainly on a level-90 Enchanter/Scribe named Shiroe. Before the Apocalypse, Shiroe was the lead strategist for a party named \u201cDebauchery Tea Party\u201d, one of the most infamous groups in all of Elder Tale. Despite his many invitations however, Shiroe chooses to never join a guild for his own reasons. Shiroe is an absolute strategic genius, though his aggressive strategies have earned him the nickname \u201cVillain in Glasses\u201d. Using his skills as a strategist, Shiroe beings to shape this anarchist world into a place worth living in. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are numerous and very well presented, with believable relationships and reactions to stimuli. One thing to remember is that in the final episodes, several love interests are formed, which, normally a bad thing, was presented well. By the end, most important characters are crushing/being crushed on by someone, though there was just enough foreshadowing throughout the series to make this okay.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show was done well. Nothing too above ordinary, as it only has a few different background tracks, but what it does have is presented well enough to help stimulate my emotions to wonder what was happening next. The ending theme in particular has a bit of bleeding onto the final seconds of each episode, which really got me excited for next week\u2019s episode. Though I\u2019 m not normally a fan of Engrish/English openings, Database was enjoyable, and I even have it on my iPod.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve stressed before that the ending to a series is important, and unfortunately, Log Horizon did fall short of my expectations. Though a good episode, the final episode left many loose ends, though this was (hopefully) done to allow a season two.\\n\\n\r\n*UPDATE* It has just come to my attention that a season 2 has been confirmed, in which case, I do approve of the current season 1 ending.\\n\\n\r\nMy final thoughts are this: don\u2019t simply write off Log Horizon as a Sword Art Online clone, as it truly isn\u2019t. I would certainly recommend it to any action/magic anime fan as well as anyone who enjoys watching character interact to reach difficult decisions. All-in-all, I\u2019ll give Log Horizon an 8/10 because it was enjoyable, though not the series ever.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out my anime review blog at trips-anime-review.tumblr.com",

            "content": "This is my first review so I'll try my best. \r\nPlot:\r\nIf you are familiar with animes like No Game No Life or SAO you will pretty much find this series enjoyable. The general idea is pretty much the same, people get traped inside a world that is related to games. In Log Horizon a huge amount of people get trapped all of suden in a world that perfectly resembles Elder Tale, a game that all of them were playing. The plot is more focused on the general development of the world, the way players change it, than on intense fighting scenes. I can proudly saythat the reason I like this story so much is because it moves slow. So 10/10 for the story\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWell, all characters are pretty well thought. The MC, Shiroe (also named The Villain in Glasses) is the most badass character in the anime and fits perfectly into the story. Maybe he is a little overpower, but it really doesn't matter cause the battles in this anime are not exactly fighten by him. He is exactly the regular mage we find in MMOs, staying behind and killing enemies with huge waves of damage while the tank shelters him.\\n\r\nBakatsugu - (or Naotsugu if you prefer) is the regular tank who is ready to sacrifice his EXP points for party's sake. He is Shiroe's friend and a training dummy for Akatsuki who hits him every time he says something about panties and breasts. He is pretty funny, and a fellow perv.\\n\r\nAkatsuki - I have one word to describe her... loli! One nice hell of a loli, a perfect combination between shyness and courage. She is the classic rogue player, sneaking behind the enemies and decimating them with poweful abilities.\\n\r\nNyanta - Well, a cat... and a gentleman... and a little girl felt in love with him... the regular 40 years old MMO player.\\n\r\nHave you noticed that I used the words regular and classic to describe every character... nope, I wasn't missing inspiration... they all are normal people trapped in a world they don't belong into, trying to raise their weapons against enemies that keep coming, trying to return in their world.\\n\r\nSo 10/10 for characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\r\nThe opening and the ending were pretty good, I still try to figure out the ending true meaning. Kinda hard. Except from this two songs that were good, I didn't find anything else to enjoy... the average soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was normal I guess... I neither liked nor dislike it.  \\n\r\nSo 8/10 for them both.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nIt was really funny with all the jokes between characters. The way Akatsuki kicks/slaps/hits Bakatsugu and after that asks Shiroe if she was allowed to do it. Also the interesting way other characters acts toward each other... such funny pairs are Krusty - Lenessia (Maybe some romance in the next season), Marielle - Bakatsugu and Henrietta - Akatsuki.\\n\r\nSo 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nIt was nicely done. The story was slow with complex development for the world and characters, kinda reminds me of Spice and Wolf at some points. If you enjoy a lot of talking without too much action I totally recommend it to you.\\n\r\n9/10 \\n\\n",

            "content": "Log horizon happens in a mmorpg-based world where people are trapped and have to live in, and where the mmorpg-concept is brought forward through mechanics, social interactions, and world design. The story focuses on the hero, shiroe, his interaction with the player-controlled city of Akihabara, the impact on the world around it, and on the emotions felt by people around him. It is done in a way that hasn\u2019t been done elsewhere, but is it capable of binding together all its element in an well-paced story? It certainly has a lot of time to do it, with 2 times 25 episodes, and a universe choicecomplex enough to fill hundreds. In short, welcome to an attempt to have a global view of log horizon. \\n\\n\r\nAfter an update of a world played mmorpg, many players worldwide have been trapped in the game, and have to learn to survive in this environment that will be their new home. The back bone of the world is a post-apocalyptic earth where nature would invade abandoned cities, combined with a medieval-fantasy world, and the attention is directed solely on japan, with a focus on the city of akihabara (Tokyo). As it is a rpg world, it is of course monsters and PNJ. And since the world is sometimes working as a game, and sometimes working as a real world, strange things happen with them. But while it's interesting to discover, I often had the feeling of being cheated by how things works. It's used more by convenience to make a background and plot twists, rather than following a real logic. It burns the eyes and the ears sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nA big part of the story involves how the mechanics of the world works, how they changed from before, and how they are changed. \"Will they respawn if they die?\" will be one of first question brought forward of course, but many others will follow. Sadly, it will open more questions that aren't, or can't be, answered. Only a faint light will be brought on how the world works, narrowing the sight of the viewer only on the chosen focus. And this kills the immersion. You simply can't dive into the world with the few explanations given to you, and how blurry they are. It would take many books to explore the possibilities their world open, yet they only give you a glance at it, and force you to eat the things they come up with. It is not done well, and the story suffers significantly from it. In a world where your limitation isn't what the game allows you to do, but the laws of physics and magic, you open yourself to limitless possibilities, and can't just limit it to what is convenient to you, especially it's given such importance. \\n\\n\r\nThe story, as said before, is centered on 3 aspects: the discovery of the world and its laws, the mmo side of completing and building things, and the emotions of the characters involved and their personal development. This said, all the story is built around the emotions and the people, while the rest is used to bring those moments, in a very pronounced way. While feelings give an interesting dimension to the anime, they are most of the time poorly exploited. In an attempt to make the viewer laugh, you will be fed with uninteresting unraveled love stories. In addition, to give a dramatic side, a huge part of the show will focus on the distress of characters you won't care about, or care enough. There isn't a single interesting character with a (realistic) personality. When you story is emotion driven, it just kills it. At some point, I choose to skip parts that were too annoying. When skip a 5 minutes part of a 20 minutes episode, I believe you can say it is pretty tasteless filling. The dialogues are also pretty bad, being often cheesy and way too long. Globally, this makes for a very slow story, with not much happening. \\n\\n\r\nSocial interaction as you might have guessed is big part of log horizon, since it's a mmorpg. Again, a lot of potential brought up here, as you have people with very different social status and background that meet, plus the interaction with a medievalesque culture. So much potential, yet such an appealing result. The anime makes a really good job at bringing those ideas forward, but always use them so poorly. It is quiet sad. Even the men-women relations are shortened to some kind broken love stories and harem bullshit, to the point where I started to call it harem horizon. But wait, there is more, as every story needs it baddies, that are bad because reasons. Every mmo has its PK, who kills because they want to, but can suddenly become good people because they are not needed as bad people anymore. The magic of imaginary personalities who have no depth.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, I must say log horizon is doing an amazing job at bringing you an interesting world, with interesting concepts, but fails miserably at using them, and that\u2019s pretty sad. All it does is shoving you with some bullshit feelings you don't care. No cookies for you, harem horizon.\\n",

I'm a sucker for the whole \"trapped in a video game\" scenario, and I guess after the disappointment I felt in Sword Art Online I was hoping for something like that, but better.\r\nIt's been a long journey following Shiroe and company around Akihabara, Eastal, and so on. At the end, where I now stand, the only thing that really sticks out is the last episode, and how a certain character's actions (no spoilers!) undid a lot of my enjoyment right there. It was enough to drag several of my sub-ratingsdown, and pulled my planned rating from a 9 to an 8.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately there's a second season on the horizon (sorry), so maybe that will restore my faith in the writers.",

Instead of trying to just survive and beat the game like in SAO, in Log Horizon, they try and establish an orderly place to live and make further developments to try to figure out why they are in the world of Elder Tale in the first place.\r\nArt and animation or pretty good. With the fight scenes Log Horizon does have theyare good, it is especially entertaining to see what the villain in glasses will do next.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is surprising intense for this anime and is great to set the mood, and the end is nice and catchy, these songs are in my iTunes!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably where this anime really shines, even though they don't get that much development (if we're are talking about their life before being trapped in Elder Tale) they are still very enjoyable and a key essence to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime truly gives off an adventure feel, just a large group of motivated people trying to establish a society in a world of fantasy that defies much logic from the real world.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to talk about which is better SAO or LH, they each have their own unique qualities and similar aspects that make them enjoyable (or not :/)\\n\\n\r\nStory (7)\\n\r\nArt (8)\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\r\nCharacter (8)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So Log Horizon. Definitely a gem of a anime. I honestly only started watching this because I saw that the opening was one of my favorite songs. It turns out that this is a great anime! Now let's just get the bad things out of the way first. So most of the voice acting is pretty good! Especially the main characters. However one of the characters is quite annoying with her voice. Que in standard cute little girl that is there for some reason voice. If you like these type of characters. Have at it. They are just not my cup of tea. Now theother thing that was just kind of forced in there is the standard love scenes. Now for the most part. They handle this well. It makes sense of why they feel this way. However right at the end they have the standard stereotypical love episode. It was a little awkward to watch. However the person they go after does not care so much about this stuff, and it doesn't really affect the storyline. It also makes sense at the end to. It was just so sudden it kind of caught me off guard. Also people admit their love when there wasn't really anything indicating that. However not a huge thing. Now for the good criticisms. The art is ok. Pretty standard, and it stands out in some parts. The sound, story, and characters is what stands out to me. It was really nice to see a main character actually not be so (sorry for the pun) two dimensional. He is extremely smart, and what he and the other characters do makes sense. It explores the multiple ways people would react of being stuck in a game. The sound is also very nice, and the pairing of the good fight scenes. Is fantastic. It actually does not make me hate magic users in video games as well. Also we don't seem to be any closer as to why everyone is stuck in this game as well. So definitely looking forward to the second season. The story is pretty good too. It feels like everything actually has meaning even though it may not be fully understood why it is happening. However it does get explained. So no plot holes from what I can see so far. Overall I would definitely recommend this anime. It is definitely a above average anime. If you want a good video game anime. Or if, unlike me, you hated sword art online. I feel like this would be a redemption anime if you felt that way about sword art. So try it out if yah want.",

There is a captivating season long plot and characters that actually develop unique personalities.  The main character may be considered as an overpowered hero simply because of his intelligence and strategic thinking, he is not the greatest fighter.\r\nThe show hits a lotof tropes, but you won't mind.

            "content": "I must admit, before I start this review, that going into this Anime I had two things in mind: Firstly that it would be a cheap rip off of S.A.O and Secondly that my expectations for this Anime where very low, quite low that I was very hesitant to start it, and only did so because MAL had it rated quite high. \r\nAfter saying that though, it is not a cheap rip off of S.A.O however I can\u2019t say that my expectations were not met, now without any more waiting on to the review. \r\nCriteria \r\nStory: 7\r\nIf anything Season 1 of Log Horizon is moreor less a prequel to what will be season 2 of Log Horizon, this I mainly due to the fact that the story really doesn\u2019t start until episode 5 and even then it doesn\u2019t get any real substance until episode 10 or so; however in short the story of Log Horizon, in short, is about a phenomenon that occurred one day which \u2018transported\u2019 hundreds of thousands of people inside and MMOPG known as Elder Tale Online. Of all the people that got sucked inside the game, the anime focuses on a guild or more specifically the guild master Shiroe, and his efforts to turn the world of Elder tale into a more livable and prosperous place. Along the way he faces many encounters and many struggles which he and his guild overcome. \\n\r\nAlso as one final note is that the problem of leaving the world of Elder Tale and going home is really only brought up towards the end of the anime, there is also no real side story that tells us about what is going home back in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nEnding: 8\\n\r\nThe only real reason I gave the ending an 8 was due to two facts: The first being the plot twist and the unveiling of a new enemy and the second being we a given a definite answer to whether or not the will be a season 2, that answer being yes and that season 2 will air in October 2014. With these two factors I might have just given the ending a 3 or a 4 but these factors were its \u2018saving grace\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nSolid Plot: 7.5\\n\r\nEven though the real story doesn\u2019t start till around episode 5-10 the plot is still good and relatively consistent, with the exception of needless filler episodes here and there, also you tend to find that some arcs that go for 5-6 episodes could really have been done with 2-3. Though seeing as Log Horizon is split up into 4-6 episode arcs the plot is east to follow and consistent enough that a side story can flow through the back of these arcs.\\n\\n\r\nMoral: 8\\n\r\nThe moral of Log Horizon is better than most Anime\u2019s out there, with that being said the moral of Log Horizon, even though it is somewhat clear and not hidden, is that sometimes we should just act good/do good deeds even if we don\u2019t get praised for them, even if other people take us for the \u2018villain\u2019 and others as the \u2018heroes\u2019. This is emphasized with the use of Shiroe and Crusty: Shiroe being the one who implements the good deed yet is looked at as a villain and Crusty doesn\u2019t do a lot except look good and take credit i.e the hero. \u2018Do good for the good of the world, not for the good of oneself\u2019. The moral doesn\u2019t kind of remind me of the ending quote of the Dark Knight. \\n\\n\r\nSense: 9\\n\r\nI have yet to mention it but the even though this Anime is based around a MMORPG they made it as if its entire audience where \u2018noobs\u2019 (by that I mean all inexperienced game players) so much so that they explain everything and I mean everything when it games to game jargon, for this reason the Anime makes too much sense and I gave it a 9, I would have gave it a 10 but the explanations get annoying. For example they explain every single skill used including its cool down time and the skill effect time etc. They also go on to explain what a \u2018tank\u2019 is or what a healer is, if it wasn\u2019t already obvious enough from the name alone.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nWith most of the low points of Log Horizon I'm glad to say that at least the music (OST, BGM etc.) were quite well done; to the point where the music helped to emphasize and enhance the mood of the scene. So if the scene was adventurous then some sort of slow and upbeat music would play creating an atmosphere fitting of that adventure. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.5\\n\r\nAnother high point for Log Horizon; the scenery was drawn beautifully and so where the characters; there were no problems of trying to distinguish one character from another and each character had the own uniqueness fitting of an MMOPG i.e races. Overall the art was done really well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThe only thing I didn\u2019t like about the characters, that also being quite a major point in any anime like this, is how little the topic of wanting to return home was brought up. We see at the start how all the players are in panic and confused about what is happening but the addressing the issue of wanting to actually go back to real world was never properly addressed.\\n\r\nAlso another negative point is that there isn\u2019t a lot of character background which doesn\u2019t give the characters a lot of substance. However character development and progression is its redeeming factor as characters don\u2019t just stay the same as they were form episode one up to episode 24 they actually do change and mature. One example of this is Shiroe getting over his fear of guilds and deciding to make decisions to change the world they currently live in, instead of sitting on the sidelines doing nothing.\\n\\n\r\nBoredom/Captivation Scale: 7.5\\n\r\nEven though this was an action based genre anime, I found there to be too little fighting and too much travelling and talking; the travelling and talking would take up a near 4 episodes where the fighting would only last for half an episode. However apart from that there was also enough drama and comedic scenes to keep me entertained whilst watching the anime so it wasn\u2019t entirely a bore. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score: 7\\n\r\nCutting to the chase, would I recommend this Anime? Looking at this Anime as a prequel to season 2 (because the story really only picks up at episode 10-15 then 20-25) then yes I would recommend this anime, however is season 2 is going to be as much of a drag as season 1 then no I wouldn\u2019t. This is simple due to the main fact that\u2019s its basically an Anime MMORPG for \u2018noobs\u2019 (inexperienced game players) and that gets quite annoying especially if you\u2019ve had your fair share of gamming.\\n\r\nThough in short this anime has enough action to be ok, enough comedy to be funny and enough drama to hold some suspense so then in general yes I would recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nGenres\\n\r\nAction: 6\\n\r\nEven though this was an action based genre anime, I found there to be too little fighting and too much travelling and talking; the travelling and talking would take up a near 4 episodes where the fighting would only last for half an episode.\\n\\n\r\nAbilities/Powers/Techniques: 8\\n\r\nWith numerous classes with different abilities there is a variety of powers and abilities for show in Log Horizon.\\n\\n\r\nAdventure: 8.5\\n\r\nReally the main genre of this anime, probably due to them wanting to show off their art style, this anime really is quite adventurous. \\n\\n\r\nGame: 8  \\n\r\nEven though it is quite \u2018nooby\u2019 they still do a good job at emphasizing the main aspects of an MMORPG game; that being character classes, abilities, guilds, currency and quests\\n\\n\r\nNote:\\n\r\nSorry for any grammar mistakes this was not proof read. \\n",

            "content": "Could have been 10/10 if second held up and wrapped up the story, but no such luck. This has been steadily improving throughout the first season, kinda like Code Geass, and it's complexity is increasing as well, and protagonist is a guy that thinks 20 moves ahead, so there's also that, and then there are at least two more comparable characters, though none is even close to being a ripoff. \r\nThe writing in this show pretty great when when it comes to first season, though it's what I like to call macro writing. As later when I read the novels I realized micro level writingisn't very good, but great direction of the first season makes up for it perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nHalf the girls are best girls. The characters are very well fleshed out and unique and they really carry the show. Plot is definitely interesting, and it deserves special props for having well explained battles with clear stakes that actually make sense in terms of game mechanics. My only worry is that second season won't explore the backstory of what actually happened in the real world. (Worry that later came true)\\n\\n\r\nSAO kinda sucked at that, but at least it tried. Log Horizon just isn't showing any signs, any spotlighting that those matters will be addressed. But in a show this well written, it seems impossible to even presume that such thing would be left unexplained (I was naive back when I wrote this).\\n\\n\r\nI was expecting the second season teaser at the end would tease exactly that, but it teased the deepening of ingame matters, increasing the richness of the world and cast further. But hey, it's kinda how Code Geass did stuff, second season just picked up at an incredible pace and went on to successfully expand upon the world, introduce even more new characters, explain everything and provide most memorable ending of all times. Can Log Horizon do that? There seems to be a potential for it, so I'm really hoping it won't be wasted. (LH doesn't seem interested in doing that after all, after watching second season I doubt author himself knows what's actually going on in the real world)",

            "content": "The only good part of this show is the that the NPCs are basically real people and have meaningful strife with the real players. Unfortunately, that's only about 30% of the story, and far less of the overall screen time.\r\n   The characters are somewhat enjoyable, though none are particularly strange enough to claim any significant feelings from a viewer over any set of characters from any other show. \r\n   The real issue is how much of this scenario is supposed to be an MMO and how absolutely fucking terribly the show portrays it. They literally live inan MMO, which has supposedly been around for 20 years(though is still the most poorly made game to ever exist), yet less than 1% of players have hit max level, and nobody in the entire game, including the veterans, acts like they've ever played anything. Every single character has severe brain damage, nobody ever uses more than 2 abilities in their repertoire of 10 minimum, and several times, abilities that previously were shown to do something, now do something else.\\n\\n\r\n   I feel I need to give some examples, so that anybody who has a shred of common sense or cares at all about video games will steer clear of this show. In an early episode, the main character uses an ability that does 1k true damage per ally hit, 5 times(max level character of the tankiest class has only 14k hp max), and then after that deals 50% of the opponents max hp. Clearly this has to be the most overpowered ability ever created, and maybe the author realized this too, because next episode the 50% hp shred was straight up removed. Did i mention that the main character only has buffing abilities, has only played solo, and was one of the first people to hit max level?\\n\\n\r\n   In that same scene, a low level healer needlessly puts out healing of about 5hp/sec, which the main character for some reason has her \"hold until the right moment.\" Then she levels up a few times, from about 19 to 24, and suddenly in a later battle she randomly puts out healing of over 1k/sec, which hilariously outheals any form of damage the entire gangrape on enemies had been doing.\\n\\n\r\n   Tanking things in this game works on a damage based aggro scale, so high dps people or tanks with \"fake high damage\" abilities tank enemies. Later on in a dangerous battle, the bard, who has been shown to have 0 damaging abilities, is in a 1v2 against the same enemies as the tank right next to her is 1v1ing. This takes place after a heartwarming several episodes where their troop learns common sense, and clearly proved that they at the very least knew how tanking works. This leads to a rough battle, where the \"smartest strategist\" in their group realizes their tank is about to die, here's how that scene plays out. \\n\\n\r\n    \"I need to use [shield ability] on [tank] or he'll die, but its on a 10 second cooldown still!\" It then shows her HUD, where we can see that ALL of her other abilities are up, several of which we have seen be fairly useful. \"But wait, that [shield ability] doesn't even work against these enemies!\" Why in the world was she using it then, nevertheless ONLY using it. \\n\\n\r\n    Also this tragedy of a battle starts with all the max levels characters sitting it out, because they have to \"regen their mana\", even though we've seen that mana fully regens in 1 hour, they haven't done anything involving mana in at least a day, and they have a plethora of mana potions.\\n\\n\r\n   The relative OK-ness of this show's characters and story barely make an attempt to outweigh the pain that is the scenario.",

Well it's very different really although really enjoyable, Log Horizon does not have tha same vision on the problem of getting stuck in a videogame as SAO. Log Horizon in that sense is \"more real\" because it explores what would happen if people got stuck in a videogame indefinetly ( in SAO at least they knew they had to complete the game for it to end) so it wonders how would people organize themselves, how would the interaction between NPC (non player characters) and characters would be,and how would this affect psycologically the characters. It explains all this while a bigger threat within the game is inminent, which makes this anime very good, exciting, and gives you something to reflect about. \\n\r\nI recomd this anime because it combines perfectly action, adventure, comedy and gives you to think about.",
