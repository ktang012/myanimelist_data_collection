            "content": "*Fan-service aside, this anime did a great job at adapting the manga material.*\r\nIt breaks my heart to see such horrible overall ratings and reviews on this anime that, for all intents and purposes, was fairly accurate and stayed faithful to the manga if one were to ignore the anime original contents (eg. mostly fan service and one useless episode).  While it is fair to say there are multiple flaws in the anime series that could have been improved on (or unnecessary contents that could have been done without), the anime as a whole has served itself quite nicely considering it is only a one-courseries.  Covering nearly 60% of the available manga materials at the time the anime finished airing, there really isn\u2019t any way for the production staffs to wrap up the story without ruining any chances for a second season.  For the record, the manga material is only two measly arcs ahead of where the anime finished at the time this review was written and the actual plot did not proceed very far.  \\n\\n\r\nI fully understand the complexity the anime brings to the new viewers who have no background knowledge from the manga.  Numerous terminologies coupled with even more numerous unfamiliar faces does prove to be quite difficult for one to digest at first.  Additionally the anime added tons and tons of boobs and nipples sprinkled everywhere in the show from the dormitory room change scenes to intense battles scenes. In short, there are bound to be boobies for the unprepared!  Thus this served as another excuse for viewers (even loyal manga readers) to detest and despise the show.  Even I have to admit it would have been better if the staffs can use those boobies air time to produce something more constructive like elaborating on certain flashback stories or further develop some characters and their personality or background.  So let this be a fair warning to all you potential viewers, only watch this show IF you can stomach the fan services and accept the fact that the story is a work in progress!!  With that said, let us finally turn our attention to introducing this anime for those of us who are still interested.\\n\\n\r\nSet in the near future, roughly 50 years from now, the world we know today has already been invaded by an alien race known as Nova.  Normal military is powerless in the face of this new threat and thus the world can only rely on girls with special tissues implanted into their backs (called Stigmata) to fight these unknown aliens.  These girls, known to the outside world as Pandora, fight in pairs with a younger boy, in order to neutralize a special effect cast by the aliens (called Freezing which freezes anything within the cast radius).  Now don\u2019t quickly jump to conclusion just yet.  While this may sound like a military action genre to you, the story in actuality takes place in an academy where Pandora are being trained.  Following the school life of a second year sophomore, Satellizer el Bridget, the story introduces the problems and threats of the reality very (and I mean very) slowly to the point where one may end up asking more questions than there are answers to.  Thus to be fair, I would categorize the anime as ecchi, school life, romance with a fair bit of action, but nothing dramatic nor is it deep in plot (though the manga is getting there).  Without a doubt, the story department is the weakest one of all as all the emphasis so far is placed on the characters interaction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.  Many many lovable girls with great looks and even better body proportions, albeit with a nasty attitude.  Yes! This is certainly not for the average female viewers!  In fact, the anime was never meant for the female audiences as evident from the trailers and even more evident as the series progress with all the boobie attacks on the screen.  With that said, the one major downside in the character department for this show is the fact that there are too many girls with not enough time to introduce them properly.  It will come as no surprise that you will likely be introduced to a new character in each episode and that the old ones will be brushed aside until close to the finale.  On the bright side, our main hero and heroine does have their own lengthy flashbacks and character development for us to \u201cknow them better\u201d.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a manga reader, seeing this series get animated with voice was wonderful.  Unfortunately it was not quite to my level of expectation in a few ways.  Firstly and perhaps the most obvious is the fact that the broadcast of the uncensored version is at a horrendous 4:3 aspect ratio (and please don\u2019t bother with the censored version, you won\u2019t understand a single thing).  Though it remains a mystery as to why the opening and ending animation are in 16:9.  The second disappointment, coming from a manga reader perspective, is the altered character looks which may or may not discourage some readers, but it was a disappointment nonetheless.  Lastly, and this I am sure is a common sentiment among all viewers, is the miscast voice acting role for Aoi Kazuya.  This voice will surely cause some damage to your eardrums. However, other than that one miscast role, it is fair to say this anime has a lot of strong seiyu in the cast.  Additionally, both the opening and ending them songs are extremely catchy and are few received by fans in general.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I have mixed feelings for this anime.  It was a pleasant surprise when the news that Freezing manga was to be animated.  While the fan service ruined some enjoyment of the show for me, I must confess that in the short one-cour time frame I am quite impressed by the production studio with the amount of manga content they were able to include in the series.  Most notably the inclusion of certain subplots that really makes certain characters much more realistic and likable.  Staying faithful to the original material and introducing some anime-original contents as enhancements to the overall story made me very pleased particularly with the fact that the production studio did not opt for an anime original ending.  With that said, I still cannot recommend this series to those who does not enjoy watching ecchi series as this show clearly relies on boobies as its major selling point.  However, if the premise of the story does intrigue you then I highly recommend giving the manga a try.  Afterall Dall-Young Lim\u2019s manga are quite well received in Korea, Japan, and even Taiwan.",

            "content": "I freely admit that I have a guilty pleasure when it comes to silly ecchi action anime just like Freezing.  So initially at least I was quite intrigued with this series and for the first few episodes I was amused.  However that amusement soon waned as it was buried under it's dozens of characters, inane nonsensical plot, and confusing terminology and technobabble.\r\nThe premise for Freezing seems like it might have had an enormous amount of potential.  Mysterious entities called Nova are invading earth intent on wiping out mankind.  All that stands in their way are special soldiers known as Pandora andtheir Limiter partners.  Our setting is a school/laboratory called West Genetics which trains future Pandora and their Limiters.  This is where that potential I was speaking of starts to get lost.  The Pandora are all, unsurprisingly all big breasted girls (hey this is anime after all!) and the Limiters are all guys.  Given that the Limiters are timid, weak, and mostly useless this is unsurprising and the only thing they really do is hide behind the skirts of the Pandora and yell \"Freezing!\" and other clich\u00e9d nonsense.  The girls on the other hand are violent and uncouth and spend most of their free time trying to kill one another or bully their underclassmen.\\n\\n\r\nNow since I have not read any of the original manga I can\u2019t speak to how well this anime adapts its story.  Even if the manga has an amazing story (which I doubt honestly) it is completely lost in its transition to an anime.  Really nothing is adequately explained from what the Pandora are to what the enemy is or why or how they are even ended fighting.  Eventually by the end you do get some explanation and can make some conclusions from the action and context but this is a piss poor way to present a story to your viewers.  Additionally for pretty much two thirds of the series nothing of significance to the plot happens.  We get introduced to the lead, Satellizer el Bridget, learn a few snippets from her past, watch her take ALOT of showers, and get groped and bullied by the cunts and bitches she has as classmates and seniors.  And for about the first eight episodes that\u2019s just about all that goes on.  What story there is remains unresolved with the ending.  Though it leaves the viewer with the impression that at least one additional season should be expected.  This kind of series always seems to get a sequel if it wants one so it\u2019s really hard to hold the ending against it.\\n\\n\r\nFor a series that is at its core about fighting, the overall action is a bit disappointing.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, there is a lot of fighting but the majority of it is crammed into the last few episodes.  Most of the early fighting is uninteresting and more about tearing apart the girls\u2019 flimsy school uniforms to expose their breasts.  If you enjoy exposed nipples and breasts then the world of Freezing should be like heaven to you. Like most fighting anime, the characters yell out lots of nonsense.  With Freezing most of it is mindless technobabble and engrish and little to none of it is ever explained.  While you can get the meaning from some of it through context it sure would be nice for the story to explain this to you once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nLike the story the characters are also a major weakness.  Neither one of our leads, Satellizer or the boy Kazuya are very interesting.  Kazuya is your typically weak and unremarkable anime boy with powers (unsurprisingly) far beyond your typical Limiter.  He has a special attraction to Satellizer that is both mysterious and due to the fact she reminds him of his dead sister.  I know shocking that someone should have a sister complex in anime right? (Pardon my eye rolling)  Satellizer, known in the school as the \"Untouchable Queen\" is a girl of dual personalities.  Her external persona is that of a cold and ruthless killer while her true personality is that of a meek and mild mannered girl with a fear of men.  Other than learning every inch of naked body through her regular trips to the shower or having her uniform torn off in all her battles we don\u2019t learn all that much about her.  What is learned fits into the narrow stereotype her character has its basis in.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is no different.  I seem to beat this point to death in an awful lot of the shows I review but the main issue with Freezing's cast is the sheer number of characters in the cast.  It is literally impossible to keep track of all the characters.  They bring in 2 or 3 a week, many of which looks almost identical to each other.  Their main purpose seems to be only to bully Satellizer who for some reason seems to really butt hurt them.  Even so, you\u2019re likely to have at least a couple that amuse or even interest you just a little bit.  For me it was Rana Linchen who is a quasi-main but whose personality I enjoyed as well as having a pretty sexy character design.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, Freezing is also weak.  For one the character models are absolutely ridiculous in most cases.  While I do like the \"full figured\" look, the extreme and impossible bust and waistlines really detract from the series.  Given how much tits and nipples are visible they really should have done a better job with this.  Everyone's figures are pretty much interchangeable and the actual animation of all the \"jiggle\" is really not that realistic or even appealing.  The color palette is very drab and depressing, with maroons, dark blues, grays, and blacks dominating the series.  The world is also incredibly dark and depressing.  While I am certain this is by design that doesn't explain why there is basically no sunlight at all and while they seem to be stuck in a world of eternal midnight.\\n\\n\r\nFreezing's voice cast is quite impressive as it seems to include almost every current seiyuu of note.  However this is a double edged sword as the reason it has so many is because the cast is so enormous.  Because of this none of the actors really gets a chance to shine.  Additionally Satellizer is horrible miscast with Mamiko Noto.  While I really enjoy her work and also seeing her portray a bit of a different character than she normally does (though also exactly the same) I just don't think her voice works for her character.  The music is solid but unspectacular action anime fair.  The OP is particularly exciting but also really drives home how ridiculous, Satellizer's in particular, chest measurements are.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I never really had any high expectations for it, ultimately Freezing is a failure.   I was hoping it would entertain me somewhere between other anime it has a lot in common with such as Seikirei and Ikkitousen.  But its lack of a coherent story, bland characters, and unappealing visuals make me unable to recommend this to anyone.\\n",

            "content": "Have any of you played the Battle Raper series? Basically, it's just another ero-fighting game where most of the time two female characters fight each other and the main goal of some players is to destroy as much clothes as possible before actually defeating your opponent. \r\nSo what does this have to do with Freezing? If you're still asking this question after watching at least an episode then clearly you're either still a cherry or you watch Mormon porn.\r\nIf you understand where I'm going with this then congrats! Your right hand is your best friend (or left for some of you) and the only reasonyou stumbled upon this is because you finished jerking off to Sekirei and wanted more hot overpowered girls with wimpy guys. Lucky for you, Freezing has all that aspects!\\n\\n\r\nSo the story is pretty simple. In the future, big inter-dimensional creatures invade Earth, hot girls used by the military to fight the battles for them (Yes, military men are all perverts ;) God bless you Uncle Sam!) and wimpy guys giving them orders. Right.. At least guys are still giving them orders.. That's all what we've got in the future.\\n\\n\r\nSo a young boy wit a japanese name (where as everyone has cool high class western names) Kazuya Aoi just transfered into one of the many Academy use to militarily train poor clueless students by robbing them of their adolescence. Now Kazuya is one lucky bastard. Because he got to see his elder sis naked before she died?? No you sickos!! It's because he is able to touch the prestigious \"Untouchable Queen\" of the academy without the risk of getting his balls chopped off.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork... Graphics are above average especially during combat scene and throw in a couple of panty shots and hundereds of \"Mune\" shots no one would be complaining. \"Im sick and tired with all these fanservice!!\" I know, I know... But this would probably never had cross your mind. Why? Because chances are you stumbled upon this review because you saw \"Battle Raper\" and instantly reminisce on your \"Semen scented days\"\\n\r\nCombat music is top notch as well, sending \"chills\" through my spines. Get it? Chills? Because this anime is called \"Freezing\" Get it?? What? I'm lame for making a lame joke??...Screw you guys.....\\n\\n\r\nSo introduction of characters! I love this part when Im reviewing.\\n\\n\r\nKazuya Aoi! Weak, but protective, lovable to all. A fine candidate for a harem male lead. Has a strong relationship BUT NOT TO THE POINT OF INCEST with his sister who died while fighitng one of those huge inter-dimensional beings.\\n\r\nHe blushes easily to any girl...seriously... ANY GIRL!\\n\\n\r\nSatellizer el Bridget! Strong in the outside, mushy in the instead. Apparently has a traumatic past and thus wont let any guys touch her except to Kazuya Aoi. \\n\\n\r\nWhy is this so? Well, according to the\" Theory of Evolution\", some males had develop into a new species named by the science community, \"Justinian Bieberious\" Im no expert on this matter, but Im guessing Kazuya Aoi is under this new species.\\n\r\nNAHH... Im just kidding... The fact is Kazuya Aoi possess something that normally the female characters in the anime would only possess (wont spoil anything here)\\n\\n\r\nSo other than those two, the rest of the cast are psychotic female warriors, a hot teacher, a hot nurse, another gay looking roommate, and powerless student council members.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, fanservice anime with hot girls fighting each other and/or giant inter-dimensional beings. If you're complaining why Japan is always making such repetitive animes its because you're probably not the targeted demography. Remember kiddies, animes are made 1) For Japan... after that 2) Rest of the world...\\n\r\nThis is one type of anime that will make you perverts go yay! when her clothes gets shred off and boo! when their clothes regenerate. So enjoy it while you can.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I've got some clothes to shred as well.. Damn.. Why do I always end up defeating the girl in battle raper before shredding her clothes?? Wait? Wouldn't it be easier to defeat her first then shred her clothes?? I mean, have you ever tried shredding clothes of an unconscious girl. Waaaay too easy.. Umm.. Not that I've ever tried... REALLY!\\n",

            "content": "Entertainment is a fickle thing. Everyone has different tastes and different opinions, so making a series that satisfies the tastes of every single individual who may come across the series is a fundamental impossibility. Although, the entertainment industry keeps tabs on what has been deemed popular all throughout the course of history, and if nothing else, they use it to their advantage. While certain aspects of entertainment may be popular, that does not always guarantee those aspects can improve the quality of a title. These things could be criticized as the intentional use of said aspects in order to draw in viewers and have thempay for something they may not really be interested in. And what is debatably the most recognized aspect of this kind in the anime industry? Sex. Enter Freezing, a series that I would describe as the gold standard of what a title looks like when you only focus on the viewer's primal instincts, and the characters' chests.\\n\\n\r\nThe driving force behind the series called Freezing is a busty, young woman named Bridget Satellizer, who's reputation as \"The Untouchable Queen\" runs rampant among the other characters present at the university. With blonde hair, a different uniform from anyone else, and the biggest bust of the bunch, her role as the main character is set in stone, and it's apparent from the start. While there are other characters introduced before her, it's hard to recall said characters when comparing them to Satellizer's overall design. While she appears menacing and cold on the outside, she's actually cold and menacing on the inside as well. That is, until the appearance of the other central, yet less important character, Kazuya Aoi transfers into the school. From that point, Satellizer's image as \"The Untouchable Queen\" comes under fire, while a looming threat lingers in the distance.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing about this series that I never understood was its priorities. This is part of my claim that this series is simply a combination of popular anime tropes. At one point, the series focuses on developing the relationship between Satellizer and Kazuya through the role of damsel in distress, as one of them is placed in a difficult situation, while the other rescues them (or attempts to) from their conflict. This is typical in shounen series and Super Mario games in particular. At another point, they focus on melodrama based on testing the bond between the two of them as new characters are placed within the plot. Then there is also the evident antagonist threat, those called Novas, that eventually become a threat to everyone involved at the school and the world. These creatures are written off as unknown creatures with unknown purposes, which may or may not be an excuse for lazy writing. The sudden shift from one situation to another is more distracting than anything, and it shows an unusual desire to move on from a certain plot point into something new, which may also be a result of lazy writing.\\n\\n\r\nEverything I've said up to this point about the plot was basically underlying problems, problems that arise after digging deep into a title and finding nothing. But what isn't underlying is the inexplicable amount of fan service shown on the outside. Sex appeal and the violence. The strongest argument I can give to support my claim is the apparent focus on these two qualities. Throughout every episode, these two qualities make themselves known in almost every situation. Whether the situation stem from tension between characters, the closeness of partners or comic relief, Freezing finds every single possible excuse to show exposed breasts or unnecessary violence. And while the violence isn't as prevalent throughout the series than the skin, it still panders to the whims of the viewer, finding unreasonable excuses to have the characters duke it out and show off their exaggerated weapons and speed. While this may not be a problem, it starts to become expected. And to expect something before it happens takes the pleasure of being surprised by the creativity of writing out of the equation. And what does this series become memorable for? When someone or something repeats a certain action enough, they become what they do, and they're remembered for that reason alone. How do I remember Freezing? Fan service alone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters within Freezing are about as typical as the writing of the series. They display qualities similar to that of other characters from other series. Satellizer is a tsundere with a remorseful past. Kazuya is the equivalent of the male harem lead. Every other character serves to back them up. They each have one quality that defines who they are, and never develop past that. Their designs are a different story, however. Satellizer's appearance is memorable and does well to support the viewer's interest in her life and problems, if not her chest. The uniforms that all other characters wear are enough to draw interest, but some issues arise in the fact that they're either never in them due to fan service, and that their battle armor looks identical to it. Which, in turn, leads to the quality of animation, which is slick and shiny enough to keep even a sloth awake. The art is of higher quality compared to other titles released during that year, but doesn't take any risks to ensure a place in history. It's well done, but it's nothing different. And with the glorious amount of exposed sexual features, it's within my power to state that they're well done, but with how much it's shown, anyone would expect them to pay attention to detail.\\n\\n\r\nIn a society where money is everything, it's easy to assume that titles like Freezing will be prevalent far along in the distant future as much as they are today. As long as sex and violence remains a popular spectrum in the minds of viewers and they use their money accordingly, these things won't disappear anytime soon. At this point, those against it have to at least applaud their durability throughout time. And to those who are so against it, perhaps they should take the chance to see how it can be improved in the future. Fan service is not a bad thing. It lets the viewer identify with the writer or writers of a title and provides them with evidence that these writers had them in mind. But that isn't to say that a series should only rely on fan service, as there are other parts to a story that need to be constructed in order to make a quality work. This statement is both controversial and a gateway to debate. A debate that I hope everyone will take seriously and will take into consideration when watching series in the future. What makes a title successful? Its revenue or its attention to quality? Freezing is a good example of this, as nothing of its quality outside of fan service could be considered good in any sense.",

            "content": "I'll have to say, the reason I started this series is because the introduction summary reminded me of Ash and Pikachu XD. But besides that, Freezing is a definite different from anime i have watched so far. \r\nPlease remember that this is my own personal opinion, whether you find it distasteful or outright wrong in your viewpoint, is your own valued perspective.\r\nStory: The story is original, although it has the overused theme of aliens coming to earth for reasons unknown other than destruction, a typical fanservice-harem anime was easily revealed when the main roles were given to sexy teenage girls with giant racks and fetishesfor younger boys. They attempted, and accomplished well to have a good amount of action and shounen aspects which I found the most blatant factor of why this anime was good. The amounts of ecchi were tastefully included, not shoved in your face at every scene, which is a plus, and the overall plot kept you guessing. Near the end however like many other short anime, was rushed dramatically, dropping the amount of effect it has on the audience. My guess was that Freezing never intended to have a second season, but did particularly well,which is why i look forward to it airing in October of 2013. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: The animations for the Limiter's Freezing have to be my favorite, other than that the soundtrack complimented well with the scenes and the art was very good. Although giagantic oppai that are too large for reality do kind of disagree with me, they kept it fairly under control. Respect points for that. The action scenes were well done too,with enough gore to add effect, but not too much to make you lose your lunch, it was done thoughtfully.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The personality traits is mainly what i look for in characters, that said,some characteristics were standard in all harem anime, but who can deny the desires of the audience =P. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i enjoyed this anime series and i recommend it to any that enjoyed similar ones such as, Pokemon (XD), Date a Live, Guilty Crown and possibly Angel Beats! fans.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER\\n\r\nThe ending really got me hooked on expecting a second season.",

Pandora is fighting against creatures called \"Novas\". Only girl can become Pandora. Pretty convenient for fandom, right? Well, Media Factory at least thinks so.\r\nArt (7/10)\r\nI have nothing to complain about here. Graphics seems pretty good. There were few too bright scenes, but that is all.\r\nSound (4/10)\r\nThis is probably first time I have said so, but I NEVER saw opening so much NOT fitting into show as here. Song is not bad itself, but seeing it with animation mademe wonder if it was written for this show. Rest of sounds was decent. Background noice was just like you would expect it to be. Still this feeling after opening lingers in me...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nBridgett. 'Nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10)\\n\r\nTOO MANY PANTSU-SHOTS! There were quite few in manga too, but what we saw here was just disturbing. There is something as restraint. Some people should remember about that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\r\nI'm dissapointed in this. After manga I was expecting something of at least decent quality and I saw what was done many times recently. Proving that fandom counts more than quailty.\\n\r\nI'll update this review later, at this point there weren't many things to be said. At this point I can feel only dissapointment.",

The overall graphics and sound quality may not be as high as some of the new productions, but the story is very interesting. \r\nI only wish the anime was longer than 13 episode because only the surface of the story can be portrayed in such a short format; only a brief back-story to why the world is in its current state is discussed. \r\nWith that being said, I really like thetwo main characters and the romantic feelings between then.  I like the idea of the super fine girl who no one wants to get involved with, due to her perceived personality and background, has an immediate reaction when she first meets the new guy, who may not look like much but definitely has that kinda hidden inner strength and swagger that any main guy should have in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I've only watched 4 episodes, I truly like the idea of the story and the development between the two main characters; I only hope the show continues in a good direction and doesn't turn to crape.\\n\\n\r\nThe main negatives:\\n\r\n - graphics aren't the greatest, buy definitely aren't bad\\n\r\n - same with the sound\\n\r\n - some might say the intro is bad but who cares about the intro and ending credits anyway, I never watch 'em\\n\r\n - a little nudity never hurt anyone, but pointless excessive nudity can just get annoying, this show edges on too many pointless boob shots\\n\\n\r\nMaybe this wasn't the best review but I'm sure the best thing I can tell you is that you'll either hate it or love it, hopefully it's the latter of the two.",

So, my rating for this anime is as follows:\r\nStory: Dreadful number 2.\r\nThe story is about genetically modified girls called \"Pandoras\" duking it out with extra dimensional invaders called \"Novas\" which only appers at the frist part of the episode, flash backs and obviously on the last 2 episodes, but instead it has more to do with the Pandoras who engage in CATFIGHTS and a whole lot of ecchi.\r\nArt: Very Good 8.\r\nWhat can I say, I like the waythe chicas were drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nNo need for me to say anything.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go over the charaters:\\n\\n\r\nSatellizer El Bridget - the infamous \"UNTOUCHABLE QUEEN\" she earned the reputation because she beat the crap out of every humbre who wants to be her limiter and whom also makes a dreadful mistake of touching her (except Aoi), she also doesn't take any crap from other Pandoras regaurdless of seniority. According to info, it is said that she was implanted with stigmata from Aoi's sister which may partly explain why she didn't instictily attacked Aoi when he touched her and later on develop a brother sister relationship with him, eventhough she doesn't want to perform a baptismal with Aoi she does wants to bond with him. She's born of noblity, but she also experience a rough childhood in the hands of her half brother molesting and abusing her, but she was saved by her elder half-sister. She's a regular at a Queen Burger stand in the school's canteen always ordering a lot of cheseburgers.\\n\\n\r\nAoi Kazuya - At frist Satellizer avoids him, later on she takes his offer to be her limiter on the condition that they will not performed a baptismal, his realtionship with Satellizer is that of a brother and sister relationship. He's the only limiter who can use freezing without being baptize, him being close to has more to do with the respect that he earned from Satellizer for standing out for her even at the cost of his own life. Also according to info, her sister is also a Pandora who risked her life to save the reamining Pandoras from the Nova's onslaught, surprisingly his attraction to Satellizer has to do with her resemblance to his sister, who also goes by the name Aoi Kazuya.\\n\\n\r\nClipton Arthur- who's is Roland Genessa's boy bitch and Aoi's friend, he's always seen with Hiiragi Kaho and one would mistaken him to be her Limiter.\\n\\n\r\nMably Elizabeth - Satellizer's next opponent, I think.\\n\\n\r\nLinchen Rana - a tibetan Pandora who has hot's for Aoi.\\n\\n\r\nFairchild Chiffon- she's the president of the west genetics student council, and may soon to be Sattllize's opponet.\\n\\n\r\nI have no words to say as to why the rating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: a very good 8.\\n\\n\r\nDon't ask.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: a fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nHey, this anime is more about fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nthe end.\\n",

            "content": "After watching the first 10 of 12 total episodes, freezing has been more addicting and easier to watch than I expected. It does a lot of things I like, things that give a feel-good feeling (and I'm not talking about the fanservice here, which is nearly constant, btw). It also mostly avoids some of the common annoyances of the action, ecchi, romance genres that tend to turn me off of a series. I'll explain all this in a moment.\r\nThe setup:\r\nThe underlying premise isn't anything special. You've got a school that trains students solely for combat. The girls are powerful fighters with lots of abilities, butthey need the support of the boys for a special power that only the boys have called Freezing. This relationship generally requires compatible males and females to pair up and develop strong bonds (in other words, become close as boyfriend/girlfriend). Fine. Accept it. It serves as a good excuse to add romance and sexual tension to the ecchi, which is always a good addition to otherwise mindless ecchi.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story:\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't anything complex or unusual. While you might think the story is supposed to be about fighting aliens from another dimension, that really isn't the focus of the story. That part of the story is just developed slowly on the margins until the final episodes. In fact, the aliens don't become a factor until the 9th episode, as part of a multi-episode climax. Almost all the fighting before then is between the heroine (Satellizer el Bridget) and the other girls. And even though fighting happens in each episode, I wouldn't exactly say it is the focus of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\n#1 reason to watch, romance/tsundere:\\n\\n\r\nThe focus of the story is mainly on the development of the romance between the main hero, Kazuya Aoi, and heroine, Satellizer. This is one of the feel-good aspects of the show I mentioned at the start of this review that I really enjoy. The heroine is a tsundere, not the kind that is violent and abusive, but rather the kind that is shy and normally a loner. She's actually feared by most of the other students and thought to be ruthless. But the Hero Aoi, who is a transfer student, is unaware of her reputation and so treats her kindly and without fear, which is new and unexpected for the heroine. This leads to all the cute feel-good stuff that usually happens with this kind of thing in anime (it's why we love tsunderes). Note: there is also some harem type romantic action from a competing love interest which sparks some jealousy, but it's mostly friendly rather than a bitchy cat fight.\\n\\n\\n\r\n#2 reason to watch, hero and heroine being impressive/cool:\\n\\n\r\nAnother feel-good repeated feature of the show that I really like is the way that the 2 main characters (who you'll probably be rooting for) continually impress others by greatly exceeding expectations. Much of the fighting involves other students trying to put them in their place and humiliate them, but they manage to turn the tables and be the ones doing the humiliating, and being awed and respected in the process. They are constantly showing us new, more advanced abilities that they shouldn't have. They take bravery, defiance, and perseverance beyond the limits. It's fun to watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting, not bad and possibly pretty good:\\n\\n\r\nI typically don't care for fighting-based anime. But I actually looked forward to the next daunting challenge each fight brought here. I didn't feel the fights were random or forced. I thought there was a very believable purpose to each fight. Each was nicely more epic than the last. Each had a distinct sense of progression and unique challenge. Thankfully, the fights aren't done in a corny shounen way where they yell and shout and it suddenly results in them being stronger. Instead, the battles are a bit more technical and skill-based rather than being based on grunting and getting pumped up mentally. They were pretty cool. The sound effects and music added positively to the coolness as well. The art wasn't anything spectacular, but I didn't think it detracted from the scenes either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFan service:\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show is absolutely full of fan service. I can't complain. I like it. It doesn't get in the way of anything. It's just there and can just as easily not be there without changing anything. All the girls look great. Boobs are larger than average, but not excessive. Though, I suppose I can complain about the one time early on that the hero sticks his face in the boobs of the heroine to hug her and is oblivious to how awkward that is. I don't like ridiculous stuff like that, but thankfully that is rare here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fairly typical. Not many surprises to be had there. The fighting is at least better than average. Fan service is there in force, if you like that. But the real draw for me was 1: the cute tsundere romance and 2: the awe-inspiring displays of raw talent and virtues from the two main characters as it gains them the respect and admiration of others. If these two things sound particularly appealing to you, and you don't mind fighting, fan service, or a background plot that spends most of the time being secondary to the romance and high school student based storyline, then I think you'll enjoy this. But if you are watching this for the alien storyline, you might feel that this other stuff just gets in the way.",

            "content": "This is exactly that case, when everything seems to be and not bad, but something is missing. The first thing that immediately attracts attention, it is quite beautiful and high-quality art, locally flavored 3D graphics. Abundance of fan service scenes really pleases the eyes and delivers the present pleasure. Girls are naked about and without reason, be it destruction clothes during a fight, specially adjusted situations or ridiculous accidents and it is necessary admit, that the young Valkyries, but in a different way the warlike-chans ways could not be called, looks like really erotic and attractive! At the same time, the picture is replete withbloody and even very cruel scenes, which, although not very different sophistication and sadism, but quite fully illustrate the scenes of bloody violence and even a frank cut. And that's all it would be good, if not a couple of frankly annoying moments. First and foremost unbearable in this picture, this frank enchantment of all the heroes of the male. While the chan is shown not only from the erotic and bloodthirsty sides, but also with a very nice, you can even say kawaii points of view, guys and especially the main character, exhibited full amoeba and nonentities. It looks so disgusting and annoyingly, that spoils all the pleasant impression of frequent and colorful explosions and mass naked female bodies. The second obvious omission is the romantic component of the anime. Her or generally should not have been or it was necessary to continue and concretize relations of the heroes. It is not possible without a shudder to look at the mutual antics of the characters and the nascent harem, when everything is openly standing still and is not going to move at all in any direction. In history, too many dramatic moments concerning the fate heroes and it is quite understandable why their relationship develops so slowly, but that's why I would like specifics and completeness, rather than a frankly cheap fanservice ending in style main character blunt brake, and all the women undress before his eyes. In general, these moments pretty spoiled impressions, but due to ART and bloodthirstiness still deserves the 9/10.\\n\r\nBonus anime ending song just 10/10 erotic masterpiece and EARGASM!\\n",

            "content": "Screw this show!\r\nI found this show via an advertisement on a youtube. I mistook it for another series I'd been looking for and watched the first episode and wow...I'll start by saying that this is easily one of the most shallow anime I've ever seen in my life (And that's saying something). Characters with little to no unique defining qualities combined with a story that just copy and pastes cliches and settings from other anime come together for the sole purpose of showing breasts. \r\nIt's a cross between Neon Genesis Evangelion and Sekirei (A less painful anime show that at least tries to hide itsintention). Don't believe me? The story is that in the future, the human race is under attack by a mysterious race of aliens/robots (Evangelion) and the only defense we have is a race of genetically altered super-girls who (Here's the Sekirei part:) depend on a respective male to reach their full power, or neutralize them. The latter act is called 'Freezing', yes that's where the title comes from, and yes it's incredibly stupid to call it that. From what I can gather, the actual act of Freezing plays a relatively small part in the show, it'd be like if Star Trek was instead called 'Teleporting'.\\n\\n\r\nI wont dare list the character's names, that'd be insulting to my intelligence. This portion only furthers my point that the show exists for fanservice, and to exploit sexuality at every turn. For instance, the show starts with with a generic boy character meeting up with his long lost sister, who is one of the 'super-girls' as mentioned above. After years of separation, he sees her and does what any flesh and blood relative would do, he puts his face between her enormous breasts and begins to motorboat her. I'm not even kidding. At all. That's just the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThis show follows the Ikki Tousen logic (I wouldn't be surprised if these shows were somehow related, though I honestly don't know). By Ikki Tousen logic, I mean the moronic physics and laws like \"tap to a girl's stomach=shirt exploding\" and \"Bigger breasts=better female character\". And I'm not joking about the first law either. It's just like Ikki Tousen and Master of Martial Hearts, in that whenever there's a fight, if there's a girl involved her clothes come off immediately. And they're not cut off or burned off, that would make too much sense. Like the other two shows, the girl would get punched or hit with blunt force, and her clothes would just magically disintegrate. Looney Tunes has a stronger sense of physics than this!\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, this show actually has a somewhat interesting visual style. It's as if one of the animators just felt bad and decided to put forward actual effort. The backgrounds and designs of the robots are actually pretty good, and though the fight scenes are terrible, the attacks are unique and look pretty darn cool. The only part the visuals really take a turn for the questionable, I'll get to that soon.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else I forgot to mention: forgettable voice acting, forgettable music, forgettable everything else. And, the part of this show that absolutely fascinates me and perplexes my mind for hours on end, the detail of this show that will likely have anyone with sense scratching their heads: This is a show about tits. Yes, there's some alien invasion BS going on in the background but it's about breasts. Now, with that understood, why do the breasts in this show not have areolae? The boobs are huge and get a lot of screen-time, but there's no visible difference in color from the breasts to the nipples. It's like someone got a naked barbie-doll and put tiny little bumps on it. Now I probably seem like a serious pervert, but when you really look at the context of the show, you can't help but wonder why boobs are drawn this way. And normally I wouldn't care, but as I said, they're the only reason this show exists, and they're thrown in your face every couple of minutes. I think every female character has her bare breasts shown almost as much as her face, so with that said, why don't they actually look like breasts? Whatever, just another area Sekirei has over this show. And when Sekirei is better, you just know it sucks.",

            "content": "Based on the first ten episodes of Freezing, I have come to the decision to write a quick review to give you an itch on what it's all about. For the impatient, this is an Ecchi anime with a fair amount of fan-service but equally as good characters and story. The art and animation is decent enough that it will not deter from the overall enjoyment of the anime and the characters each have backgrounds which are briefly explained at varying levels at some point. I enjoyed this anime, if you are a fan of... fan-service, then. Enjoy yourself ;)\r\nThe story is pretty interesting, girlsand guys take on roles to use somewhat interesting abilities. It takes place in a school, from the eyes of a young male protagonist, based on the make-up of how the roles are set, it's normal to see younger males pairing up with older females. Considering the rating of this anime and the \"Ecchi\" tag, you can imagine what it's all about. It does however pick up a lot of depth towards the end, nudging you towards the edge of your seat in anticipation as more exciting events unveil.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty standard just as the animations are. Do not expect jaw-dropping visuals unless you're asking about the fan-service stills growing like mushrooms on your screen in-between each episode? Yeah, they're okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, there are a variety of voices you can hear. The soundtrack is actually very decent, which took me by surprise. You can expect some interesting orchestral spin-togethers and catchy Opening and Ending sequences.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are fairly well portrayed and as with any decent anime you get a good feel for each personality. Each major character has a varying amount of background information shown either in a flashback or self-introductory scene.\\n\\n\r\nBut all in all, I enjoyed this anime and as said at the start you will enjoy it too if you are a fan of Ecchi. There's fighting, fanservice and plenty of cool-down time where you get to know the characters, as well as some pretty decent gripping action towards the end.",

            "content": "Before I start this review I will say: I will try to keep this review spoiler free, and welcome to titsville.\r\nI have mixed feelings about this anime. There are some good aspects. However, if you decide to watch this, you are in for one hell of a ride, to hell. The combination of tits-for-brains characters and constant meaningless fanservice left me cringing and facepalming on multiple occasions. If you don't feel like reading my jumbled thoughts, skip right to the conclusion.\r\nStory:\r\nLets start with the good news. The story was actually quite interesting. Although it could have been executed much better, the story intrigued me enoughto watch until the end despite all the horse shit (which will be discussed later) that takes place from beginning to end. The season finale looked like it was going to be meaningful, but don't be fooled, it's a mediocre harem after all.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one filler-like episode where nothing happens plot-wise. It's in this episode that you see exactly how boring this anime would be without the story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIf you ignore the disproportionate tits and constant meaningless panty shots, the artwork is fairly decent. Most of the fight scenes are decent. Some of the action scenes seemed too slow and lazily drawn, but for the most part, they managed to keep the momentum going. \\n\r\n( '-')b\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also contains some scenes of gore. Although it wasn't implemented the way I liked, at least it was a step in the right direction. An arm or leg falling off illogically here and there, very meaningful ( '-')b (sarcasm). Aside from that, gore is decently implemented for scenes where the tits-for-brains syndrome doesn't kick in to overshadow the blood.\\n\\n\r\nI will now tell you about tits, because it seems to be the heart of the anime. Most of the important characters have over-sized over-sized tits. Not so bad right? Well they sure like to slap it on your faces :). What happens when someone gets slashed? They bleed right? Well in the case of Freezing, you constantly wonder where the blood comes from. When a female gets slashed, blood splatters and the cloth covering their tits shreds off. You will notice that the female shows no signs of slash wounds, her tits are conveniently uncovered and unscathed. You begin to wonder where the blood really comes from, them or their clothes? If you happen to like watching clothes (only around their tits) being torn off randomly and illogically during important and meaningful scenes, then this may be the anime for you. Along with that, they seem to think it's a good idea to slap in as many meaningless panty shots as possible.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (I think this section has spoilers):\\n\\n\r\nThe entire school staff in this anime seems to only consist of two or three tits-for-brains, because that is how incompetent they are. Despite chaos and earthquakes, teachers either are never there to resolve issues, or show up too late. For some reason they seem to only show up when it's inconvenient for the main heroine. FOR SOME REASON, the main heroine is always taking most of the blame even though it's painfully obvious who is at fault.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a social hierarchy in the school between students of different grades. For some reason, most of the 3rd year students who are part of the cast are extremely stupid psychos. I wonder why they are not expelled from the school. I forgot, the staff members have tits for brains.\\n\\n\r\nLet me introduce you to the main villain of this anime, the main character (MC). Are you looking for an MC that surpasses the generic harem MC? Well look no further. Actually, you shouldn't look here at all, because the only aspect in which he excels is... stupidity. Take a generic harem MC, and replace his brain with rocks. Congratulations, your typical harem MC has evolved into Aoi Kazuya! It appears that this MC has no sense of common decency whatsoever. During times of crisis he gives out some cool speeches, and sometimes they even sound stupid. There isn't really much depth to this character. Make an MC, throw in some random \"cool\" speeches, make the girls love him for no reason, and don't forget the overdose of idiocy.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the MC, the main heroine seems to be likable... at first. The main heroine was intriguing. I wanted to know more about her past and why she behaved the way she did. Oh I found out all right, that she is probably delusional. Her backstory contradicts the way she feels for the main character, and she seems to only act like that towards him for... hold on, there is no reason whatsoever. Go harem MC power ( '0')/\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nFor god's sake, stop moaning when you transform. Other than that, it seems pretty normal, except for the MC's annoying voice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nIt pains me to watch a potentially good anime being destroyed by excessive fan service, illogical events and characters that lack common sense. Despite the horse shit, the story was interesting, the action scenes had momentum, the animations were decent (excluding fanservice), and the main heroine was interesting (until the later episodes that is).",

            "content": "I think it goes without saying that the ecchi genre has a reputation for putting out shows that are of a lower caliber. The reason the Anime are associated with being such a low caliber comes from the fact that most of the ecchi genre places what possibly amounts to to much emphasis on the fan service.  That doesn't mean though, there aren't shows in the ecchi genre that actually have quality to them.\r\nFreezing, despite sharing similar attributes to Claymore, happens to be one of those Anime that stands out as having quality to the storyline despite being of the ecchi genre. Sure, theseries has plenty of fan service, but none of it is forced and every shot is actually believable within the context of the story. There is no pushing \u201cthe willing suspense of disbelief for this story.\u201d Every step is thought out.\\n\\n\r\nThis includes the artwork and the characterization. All of the action scenes flow realistically, not to mention this is one of those shows that as I've said before, due to the subject matter, would be hard to pull off without the ecchi moments. On top of this, the female characters aren't degraded into being mere eye candy for the main protagonist and his friends to ogle over and have to protect because they are girls. No... the girls are allowed to stand on their own two feet.",

            "content": "'Freezing' is an anime that people will approach from several different angles. There are the people that will be watching for the outrageous fight scenes,  and others will watch for the ample fan service. What surprised me at the conclusion of the show was that I thought back on the series as, first and formost, a futuristic apocalyptic tale in the same realm of subject matter as Neon Genesis Evangelion. It is a return to the subjects of a show that created a surge of more adult-themed stories and content in anime. Every rose has its thorns, as the show itself says, so let'sdelve into the components of 'Freezing.'\\n\\n\r\nStory: I will try not to give away the best bits! Basically, the story revolves around a highschool-aged group of female superstrong Genetics soldiers and their slightly younger male partners, whose power combined is just enough to fight Genetic's greatest foe, the Nova. Right from the beginning, this show flaunts the extreme violence that comes with training for war. We meet the main characters, Sattelizer and Kazuya just as a \"carnival\" (read: masochistic annual tournament) is wrapping up, with Sattelizer as the heavy favorite in the second years. The late transfer student and the secluded, tormented fighter makes for a great story of reconciliation and selfless love. We get to see the characters as they fight over school politics, war partners, and each other's hearts. The story has a tendency of showing emotions through protracted fights rather than dialogue, and there were a few points where I just wanted to shove two characters in a room and make them talk. It's frustrating when the source of drama is sometimes just silly miscommunications or assumptions, but I guess these fighters and defenders of the earth are a tad egotistical and self-involved. It comes with the territory.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time you're wondering just where the show will go with its fleshed out leads, a large attack befalls Genetics, and Sattelizer and Kasuya find themselves right in the middle. The emotional plot really does play into each character's effectiveness as a fighter, which makes the story much more enthralling. I loved the last four episodes. They were dramatic, had some great twists in the fight, and generally made the show. The stakes feel high in the battle, and I was caring for the different characters, as their survival did not seem to be assured. Now, here's some not-so-sweet news: there is a good amount of boobs and poses thrown into this anime, and though it is almost always related to the fights (as their ever-shredded stigma fabric suits are indicative of their condition), some will see this as gratuitous and pointless. And as I said before, the fights can last quite a while, robbing the viewer of more character development or general setting about the outside world.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The character designs for everyone is great. We see many nationalities at Genetics, and it actually shows some in their look. Also, every Pandora's a babe, and you will be seeing many a pair of fight-revealed titties (for better or worse, this show is a kind of ecchi), and if it's important to you, they are quite the mammaries. The fighters use a variety of tactics and weapons in their fights, and oh are the fights extraordinary! Great animation paired with a visceral feel of classmates/comrades fighting all out (thank goodness for their magical hospital!) makes for exciting fights that feel like they have lots of power behind them and real consequences. Both the fights and the more dialogue-heavy scenes are well-animated, with good, strong emotions coming through with most of the characters. CGI is used for some of the special moves in a way that blends well with the drawn characters and enemies.  It looked like it belonged in the fights, and I think that's the best compliment I could give. Blood and gore are present, but never gratuitous, and the expressions of pain that comes with each hit looks the part. Settings can sometimes be bland-- the school is pretty, I guess, and the city in the last arc does give off a futuristic vibe, but sets in the Genetics compound and during fights are dark and spartan. This is a more generic future than NGE's Nerve center, and the beautiful landscapes of that world. The most important parts, though (the characters, the fights, and the enemy design) come out as the focus, and these elements more than make up for the lack of pretty sunsets.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP is fairly good, and this is coming from a chronic skipper. I found myself humming along often, and the montage during the song is a good overview of the characters and their job: kicking ass to protect the world. The ED is more techno, and has stills behind it rather than animation, but it's still a catchy tune. The soundtrack is usually servicable techno, some piano. It gets the job done. I thought the seiyuu performed admirably. Sattelizer and Kazuya are well-done by their respective actors. There's a \"rural\" character in the show, and her dialect sounds different even to me, a complete japanese newb. Everyone has great force behind their lines during fights, and especially at the end. Overall, a great and even effort. Also, the sound design for the fights and Nova are great. The special moves really pick up intensity when their sound effects give some weight to the punches and slashes. Oh, and that sound the Novas make? It's really creepy and scary. The sound helps make these behemoths seem menacing and frightfully dangerous.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The crux of this show is the relationship between Sattelizer and Kazuya, and as they draw closer to each other, both of them have to look back on their lives and their motivations to fight before they can handle a Nova fight. Sattelizer had a traumatic childhood, but in the beginning, all you can think is \"ice queen\". Who better to thaw the Untouchable Queen's heart than Aoi Kazuyah, the brother of the deceased hero of the last Nova war? There's plenty of meat on these characters, and seeing Kazuya's iron will and its affect on Sattelizer makes for good drama, most of the time. It seems like they pulled the rug out from under our feet at the end, though. We never get to see the result of them caring for each other, this \"baptism\" of sorts, which cheapens the conclusion of the series, in my opinion. Though the other, secondary characters also have varied and refined personalities, the focus on fights and the main two mean that you'll be left reading info cards after the commercial breaks to learn about the other fighting vixens. Lana, Ganessa, and Chiffon are all great personalities to have around Sattelizer and Kazuya, but I just wish I knew more about their stories. In the end, the characterization are meant to lend emotional power to the action climax of the show, and for all my complaining, it worked!\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. I started watching for the fight scenes and boobs, and ended up staying for the exciting, world-in-the-balance conclusion. This is an adult anime that eschews the ditzy humor of most ecchi for a serious sci-fi story of love and sacrifice. About the 20th time a blade cuts of a girl's clothing but not her skin, you realize that fanservice is a big part of the show, but by no means is it the biggest. If you can't stand these parts, ask yourself what the difference is between this and the naughtier bits of Rome, True Blood, or Weeds. Adult shows have some T&A, get used to it and just watch the censored version if you're too boob-shy. There are some niggling issues with bland-ish settings and Sattelizer's crushing inability to talk to Kazuya about important things in a normal manner, but these are all small imperfections on a generally good, sometimes great futuristic sci-fi action series.

            "content": "Freezing is a true embodiment of what makes shounen, well shounen. A butt load of action, and a lot of naked butts to go with it. Of course, that is a very simplistic and 'large in identity' assumption of me, but that is the type of eye candy we usually get. I have to say, despite my open distaste for fanservice, I have to admit that Freezing is pretty good at hitting the sweet tooth it aims for.\r\nThere are a lot of things that work against this show; firstly the plot is very slow and somewhat shallow as every girl, in this academy pandora, decidethey want to pick a fight with Satella. Despite it being faithful to the manga, the ending arc which has actual relevance to the setting seems as if they just wanted to have some actual plot. While it is nice it has a lot of action, this is what ends up limiting the story of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is solid and pretty enjoyable, and it damn right should be seeing how it takes up some much screen time. I wouldn't be wrong to judge that at least a third of the show is spent with weapons drawn. The girls each have their own special pandora weapon and after watching the opening battle you know that nobody is pulling their punches as the blood rains down.\\n\\n\r\nOf course our female lead might be a little uptight and tsundere, but her background fully justifies her behavior, and allowed me to sympathize with her a lot. The same can not be said for our pathetic clich\u00e9 male lead. He is completely stupid and head over heels for Satella, but unfortunately we can't have a bad lead right? So they made him the most powerful limiter* in existence - The pandora's male companion who can use 'freezing' to stop the enemy movement. This is another shounen aspect in case you weren't wondering, where the main character pulls tricks out of his butt without having any idea why he is special. The rest of the pandora's we meet are average characters without much depth, but they aren't horrendous either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFreezing is an okay watch if your looking for something that is easy to follow. It doesn't have very good characters or story, but it maintains a high level of enjoyment despite these weaknesses.",

I found that the Nova weren't really focused on at all until the last episodes, but the first half of the series was entertaining and flowed nicely. The story line is episode-by-episode for the most part but easy to keep track of. \r\nArt/4\r\nThe characters were physically distinguishable - if only by hairstyle for all the redheads but I mean. The breasts were unnatural and vaguely uncomfortable to look at, since they more like resembled balloons that jutted outwards. Ehhh. Allin all I didn't find the art particularly unique, pretty average. \\n\\n\r\nSound/8\\n\r\nI watched the English dubbed version  and I loved it! The voice actors were well matched to their characters. It was pleasant to listen too, nothing felt phoney or forced. I highly recommend the dubbed version! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter/7\\n\r\nSatella's whole character was really admirable to me. I realize that she might be viewed as cliche, but when we were given her backstory and then guided through her character development it was so easy to sympathize with her. Her never-give-up personality makes her fun to root for. She's a strong female character who is finding genuine affection and companionship for the first time. It made me like Kazuya's character as well, since he was the one who was the first to fight for her. I found the two of them very likeable and of course it made the series that much more enjoyable! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/7\\n\r\nThis isn't a cute, fluffy series to watch if that's what you're looking for - but if you're looking for a short series with lots of action, that ecchi element, and some interesting characters, I would say give this a shot :)",

The series also includes some great humorous scenes and acts, some great romance sub-plots and plenty of action.\r\nA little warning though, despite all the said above in favor of the series, the series' storyline tends to get somewhat confusing if you don't pay enough attention to the details, and there's some new and nifty terminology to it thatyou must pick up early, or you'll miss a lot.",

            "content": "If you are reading this because you have not yet seen this anime and are trying to see whether or not this is the right show for you, then please keep in mind that this review is of my own opinion that may differ from you own, so keep your own personal tastes in mind. If you have already seen this anime and are reading this then you're kind of just along for the ride.\r\nStory/Characters:\r\nThe story for freezing is set in a semi-futuristic world where humanity is under threat by inter-dementonal aliens called Nova and young girls; augmented with superpowers named Pandora are tasked withfighting them (Read the synopsis).\\n\r\nFreezing from the very get go has a pretty solid concept and story with a few sci-fi things sprinkled here and there and enough lore to flesh things out and in fact the story is probably one of this anime's strong points, but if only it could focus on that all the time. This anime; being included as Ecchi has it's fair share of fan service and occasional female nudity, I'm just letting you know so this doesn't come as a surprise.\\n\r\nDespite all of that the story alone still holds it's own with some consistent action sequences featuring some pandora vs pandora combat. It's doesn't have the greatest story in the world but this anime defiantly had me watching one episode after the other and I wasn't disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, the characters to some extent were a little weaker than the story but with some exceptions. Kasuya; the leading male protagonist didn't seem all that interesting to me, sure most of the story was seen through his eyes and there were a few things we got to learn about his character and he develops a good working relationship with Satellizer the Female MC but he unfortunately still came off as a little dull to me. Another character that's kind of weak (in writing) was Rana who comes in later in the series, Rana's only real purpose in the story seemed to be to create a love triangle between the main characters and despite proving useful sometimes, this anime really could have done with out her.\\n\r\nTo end this section on a good not Satellizer; the Female MC I mentioned before, was probably the best character in the whole series, and that's something I don't say lightly. This character is introduced as a badass with a hard exterior and prefers to have people at arms length. I won't say anything more other than that there is a lot more than what is seen on the surface, which is uncovered over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt/sound:\\n\r\nThe art and animation is another strong point in this anime, the action sequences were really well choreographed and character designs were really good, especially for the female characters.\\n\r\nThe music though I don't remember any of the particular tracks from the OST was pretty solid for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nSub/Dub:\\n\r\nHonestly I wouldn't really suggest one version over the other for this anime, though I will mention that Funimation did a pretty good job with the dub, as for watching it subbed, I had a pretty similar experience with it, so my suggestion would be to go with what ever you feel comfortable with.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nI'm going to give this a 7 out of 10, this anime isn't perfect with all it's fan service and love triangles but I have to give credit where credit is due and say \"hey, this wasn't half bad.\"\\n\r\nI would almost suggest watching this if you want to see something with fanservice for the sake of watching fan service, that way you also get a good story out of it as well.",

But then she gets to see a boy called \"Aoi, Kazuya\". She starts to get feelings for Kazuya and let him touch her body, normally she nearly killed people who touched her. After that Kazuya wants to be her Limiter but she is too shy to accept and confrontKazuya, that's actually how the story starts...\\n\\n\r\nSo every Pandora girl has an Limiter, except for Satellizer due to her trauma. Normally to fight the enemy Nova, the girls need Limiters who can Freeze the enemy movement. That is only possible if those both partners have done the Baptism (joining). But Kazuya is able to Freeze without the need of Baptism, like his sister \"Aoi, Kazuha\". \\n\\n\r\nSo actually its pretty interesting how the story continues, I really enjoyed this series, hope there will be an Season 2 in future, the ending was open.\\n\\n\r\n======\\n\\n\r\nNow about the rating, \\n\\n\r\nStory 8, is very interesting and enjoyable!\\n\\n\r\nArt 7, the art could have been better, but still its pretty decent!\\n\\n\r\nSound 9, the sound is very good, the effects/fighting sounds are really good, soundtracks was very nice, I really liked the Nova screaming sound!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9, nothing to tell about it, characters are awesome!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9, really enjoyed it, no boring episodes or childish stuff.\\n\r\nBlood splatters, slashed body parts, the fighting scenes are all topnotch!\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*Fan-service aside, this anime did a great job at adapting the manga material.*\r\nIt breaks my heart to see such horrible overall ratings and reviews on this anime that, for all intents and purposes, was fairly accurate and stayed faithful to the manga if one were to ignore the anime original contents (eg. mostly fan service and one useless episode).  While it is fair to say there are multiple flaws in the anime series that could have been improved on (or unnecessary contents that could have been done without), the anime as a whole has served itself quite nicely considering it is only a one-courseries.  Covering nearly 60% of the available manga materials at the time the anime finished airing, there really isn\u2019t any way for the production staffs to wrap up the story without ruining any chances for a second season.  For the record, the manga material is only two measly arcs ahead of where the anime finished at the time this review was written and the actual plot did not proceed very far.  \\n\\n\r\nI fully understand the complexity the anime brings to the new viewers who have no background knowledge from the manga.  Numerous terminologies coupled with even more numerous unfamiliar faces does prove to be quite difficult for one to digest at first.  Additionally the anime added tons and tons of boobs and nipples sprinkled everywhere in the show from the dormitory room change scenes to intense battles scenes. In short, there are bound to be boobies for the unprepared!  Thus this served as another excuse for viewers (even loyal manga readers) to detest and despise the show.  Even I have to admit it would have been better if the staffs can use those boobies air time to produce something more constructive like elaborating on certain flashback stories or further develop some characters and their personality or background.  So let this be a fair warning to all you potential viewers, only watch this show IF you can stomach the fan services and accept the fact that the story is a work in progress!!  With that said, let us finally turn our attention to introducing this anime for those of us who are still interested.\\n\\n\r\nSet in the near future, roughly 50 years from now, the world we know today has already been invaded by an alien race known as Nova.  Normal military is powerless in the face of this new threat and thus the world can only rely on girls with special tissues implanted into their backs (called Stigmata) to fight these unknown aliens.  These girls, known to the outside world as Pandora, fight in pairs with a younger boy, in order to neutralize a special effect cast by the aliens (called Freezing which freezes anything within the cast radius).  Now don\u2019t quickly jump to conclusion just yet.  While this may sound like a military action genre to you, the story in actuality takes place in an academy where Pandora are being trained.  Following the school life of a second year sophomore, Satellizer el Bridget, the story introduces the problems and threats of the reality very (and I mean very) slowly to the point where one may end up asking more questions than there are answers to.  Thus to be fair, I would categorize the anime as ecchi, school life, romance with a fair bit of action, but nothing dramatic nor is it deep in plot (though the manga is getting there).  Without a doubt, the story department is the weakest one of all as all the emphasis so far is placed on the characters interaction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.  Many many lovable girls with great looks and even better body proportions, albeit with a nasty attitude.  Yes! This is certainly not for the average female viewers!  In fact, the anime was never meant for the female audiences as evident from the trailers and even more evident as the series progress with all the boobie attacks on the screen.  With that said, the one major downside in the character department for this show is the fact that there are too many girls with not enough time to introduce them properly.  It will come as no surprise that you will likely be introduced to a new character in each episode and that the old ones will be brushed aside until close to the finale.  On the bright side, our main hero and heroine does have their own lengthy flashbacks and character development for us to \u201cknow them better\u201d.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a manga reader, seeing this series get animated with voice was wonderful.  Unfortunately it was not quite to my level of expectation in a few ways.  Firstly and perhaps the most obvious is the fact that the broadcast of the uncensored version is at a horrendous 4:3 aspect ratio (and please don\u2019t bother with the censored version, you won\u2019t understand a single thing).  Though it remains a mystery as to why the opening and ending animation are in 16:9.  The second disappointment, coming from a manga reader perspective, is the altered character looks which may or may not discourage some readers, but it was a disappointment nonetheless.  Lastly, and this I am sure is a common sentiment among all viewers, is the miscast voice acting role for Aoi Kazuya.  This voice will surely cause some damage to your eardrums. However, other than that one miscast role, it is fair to say this anime has a lot of strong seiyu in the cast.  Additionally, both the opening and ending them songs are extremely catchy and are few received by fans in general.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I have mixed feelings for this anime.  It was a pleasant surprise when the news that Freezing manga was to be animated.  While the fan service ruined some enjoyment of the show for me, I must confess that in the short one-cour time frame I am quite impressed by the production studio with the amount of manga content they were able to include in the series.  Most notably the inclusion of certain subplots that really makes certain characters much more realistic and likable.  Staying faithful to the original material and introducing some anime-original contents as enhancements to the overall story made me very pleased particularly with the fact that the production studio did not opt for an anime original ending.  With that said, I still cannot recommend this series to those who does not enjoy watching ecchi series as this show clearly relies on boobies as its major selling point.  However, if the premise of the story does intrigue you then I highly recommend giving the manga a try.  Afterall Dall-Young Lim\u2019s manga are quite well received in Korea, Japan, and even Taiwan.",

            "content": "I freely admit that I have a guilty pleasure when it comes to silly ecchi action anime just like Freezing.  So initially at least I was quite intrigued with this series and for the first few episodes I was amused.  However that amusement soon waned as it was buried under it's dozens of characters, inane nonsensical plot, and confusing terminology and technobabble.\r\nThe premise for Freezing seems like it might have had an enormous amount of potential.  Mysterious entities called Nova are invading earth intent on wiping out mankind.  All that stands in their way are special soldiers known as Pandora andtheir Limiter partners.  Our setting is a school/laboratory called West Genetics which trains future Pandora and their Limiters.  This is where that potential I was speaking of starts to get lost.  The Pandora are all, unsurprisingly all big breasted girls (hey this is anime after all!) and the Limiters are all guys.  Given that the Limiters are timid, weak, and mostly useless this is unsurprising and the only thing they really do is hide behind the skirts of the Pandora and yell \"Freezing!\" and other clich\u00e9d nonsense.  The girls on the other hand are violent and uncouth and spend most of their free time trying to kill one another or bully their underclassmen.\\n\\n\r\nNow since I have not read any of the original manga I can\u2019t speak to how well this anime adapts its story.  Even if the manga has an amazing story (which I doubt honestly) it is completely lost in its transition to an anime.  Really nothing is adequately explained from what the Pandora are to what the enemy is or why or how they are even ended fighting.  Eventually by the end you do get some explanation and can make some conclusions from the action and context but this is a piss poor way to present a story to your viewers.  Additionally for pretty much two thirds of the series nothing of significance to the plot happens.  We get introduced to the lead, Satellizer el Bridget, learn a few snippets from her past, watch her take ALOT of showers, and get groped and bullied by the cunts and bitches she has as classmates and seniors.  And for about the first eight episodes that\u2019s just about all that goes on.  What story there is remains unresolved with the ending.  Though it leaves the viewer with the impression that at least one additional season should be expected.  This kind of series always seems to get a sequel if it wants one so it\u2019s really hard to hold the ending against it.\\n\\n\r\nFor a series that is at its core about fighting, the overall action is a bit disappointing.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, there is a lot of fighting but the majority of it is crammed into the last few episodes.  Most of the early fighting is uninteresting and more about tearing apart the girls\u2019 flimsy school uniforms to expose their breasts.  If you enjoy exposed nipples and breasts then the world of Freezing should be like heaven to you. Like most fighting anime, the characters yell out lots of nonsense.  With Freezing most of it is mindless technobabble and engrish and little to none of it is ever explained.  While you can get the meaning from some of it through context it sure would be nice for the story to explain this to you once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nLike the story the characters are also a major weakness.  Neither one of our leads, Satellizer or the boy Kazuya are very interesting.  Kazuya is your typically weak and unremarkable anime boy with powers (unsurprisingly) far beyond your typical Limiter.  He has a special attraction to Satellizer that is both mysterious and due to the fact she reminds him of his dead sister.  I know shocking that someone should have a sister complex in anime right? (Pardon my eye rolling)  Satellizer, known in the school as the \"Untouchable Queen\" is a girl of dual personalities.  Her external persona is that of a cold and ruthless killer while her true personality is that of a meek and mild mannered girl with a fear of men.  Other than learning every inch of naked body through her regular trips to the shower or having her uniform torn off in all her battles we don\u2019t learn all that much about her.  What is learned fits into the narrow stereotype her character has its basis in.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is no different.  I seem to beat this point to death in an awful lot of the shows I review but the main issue with Freezing's cast is the sheer number of characters in the cast.  It is literally impossible to keep track of all the characters.  They bring in 2 or 3 a week, many of which looks almost identical to each other.  Their main purpose seems to be only to bully Satellizer who for some reason seems to really butt hurt them.  Even so, you\u2019re likely to have at least a couple that amuse or even interest you just a little bit.  For me it was Rana Linchen who is a quasi-main but whose personality I enjoyed as well as having a pretty sexy character design.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, Freezing is also weak.  For one the character models are absolutely ridiculous in most cases.  While I do like the \"full figured\" look, the extreme and impossible bust and waistlines really detract from the series.  Given how much tits and nipples are visible they really should have done a better job with this.  Everyone's figures are pretty much interchangeable and the actual animation of all the \"jiggle\" is really not that realistic or even appealing.  The color palette is very drab and depressing, with maroons, dark blues, grays, and blacks dominating the series.  The world is also incredibly dark and depressing.  While I am certain this is by design that doesn't explain why there is basically no sunlight at all and while they seem to be stuck in a world of eternal midnight.\\n\\n\r\nFreezing's voice cast is quite impressive as it seems to include almost every current seiyuu of note.  However this is a double edged sword as the reason it has so many is because the cast is so enormous.  Because of this none of the actors really gets a chance to shine.  Additionally Satellizer is horrible miscast with Mamiko Noto.  While I really enjoy her work and also seeing her portray a bit of a different character than she normally does (though also exactly the same) I just don't think her voice works for her character.  The music is solid but unspectacular action anime fair.  The OP is particularly exciting but also really drives home how ridiculous, Satellizer's in particular, chest measurements are.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I never really had any high expectations for it, ultimately Freezing is a failure.   I was hoping it would entertain me somewhere between other anime it has a lot in common with such as Seikirei and Ikkitousen.  But its lack of a coherent story, bland characters, and unappealing visuals make me unable to recommend this to anyone.\\n",

Basically, it's just another ero-fighting game where most of the time two female characters fight each other and the main goal of some players is to destroy as much clothes as possible before actually defeating your opponent. \r\nSo what does this have to do with Freezing? If you're still asking this question after watching at least an episode then clearly you're either still a cherry or you watch Mormon porn.\r\nIf you understand where I'm going with this then congrats! Your right hand is your best friend (or left for some of you) and the only reasonyou stumbled upon this is because you finished jerking off to Sekirei and wanted more hot overpowered girls with wimpy guys. Lucky for you, Freezing has all that aspects!\\n\\n\r\nSo the story is pretty simple. In the future, big inter-dimensional creatures invade Earth, hot girls used by the military to fight the battles for them (Yes, military men are all perverts ;) God bless you Uncle Sam!) and wimpy guys giving them orders. Right.. At least guys are still giving them orders.. That's all what we've got in the future.\\n\\n\r\nSo a young boy wit a japanese name (where as everyone has cool high class western names) Kazuya Aoi just transfered into one of the many Academy use to militarily train poor clueless students by robbing them of their adolescence. Now Kazuya is one lucky bastard. Because he got to see his elder sis naked before she died?? No you sickos!! It's because he is able to touch the prestigious \"Untouchable Queen\" of the academy without the risk of getting his balls chopped off.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork... Graphics are above average especially during combat scene and throw in a couple of panty shots and hundereds of \"Mune\" shots no one would be complaining. \"Im sick and tired with all these fanservice!!\" I know, I know...

Because chances are you stumbled upon this review because you saw \"Battle Raper\" and instantly reminisce on your \"Semen scented days\"\\n\r\nCombat music is top notch as well, sending \"chills\" through my spines. Get it? Chills? Because this anime is called \"Freezing\" Get it?? What? I'm lame for making a lame joke??...Screw you guys.....\\n\\n\r\nSo introduction of characters! I love this part when Im reviewing.\\n\\n\r\nKazuya Aoi! Weak, but protective, lovable to all. A fine candidate for a harem male lead. Has a strong relationship BUT NOT TO THE POINT OF INCEST with his sister who died while fighitng one of those huge inter-dimensional beings.\\n\r\nHe blushes easily to any girl...seriously... ANY GIRL!\\n\\n\r\nSatellizer el Bridget! Strong in the outside, mushy in the instead. Apparently has a traumatic past and thus wont let any guys touch her except to Kazuya Aoi. \\n\\n\r\nWhy is this so? Well, according to the\" Theory of Evolution\", some males had develop into a new species named by the science community, \"Justinian Bieberious\" Im no expert on this matter, but Im guessing Kazuya Aoi is under this new species.\\n\r\nNAHH... Im just kidding... The fact is Kazuya Aoi possess something that normally the female characters in the anime would only possess (wont spoil anything here)\\n\\n\r\nSo other than those two, the rest of the cast are psychotic female warriors, a hot teacher, a hot nurse, another gay looking roommate, and powerless student council members.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, fanservice anime with hot girls fighting each other and/or giant inter-dimensional beings. If you're complaining why Japan is always making such repetitive animes its because you're probably not the targeted demography. Remember kiddies, animes are made 1) For Japan... after that 2) Rest of the world...\\n\r\nThis is one type of anime that will make you perverts go yay! when her clothes gets shred off and boo! when their clothes regenerate. So enjoy it while you can.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I've got some clothes to shred as well.. Damn.. Why do I always end up defeating the girl in battle raper before shredding her clothes?? Wait? Wouldn't it be easier to defeat her first then shred her clothes?? I mean, have you ever tried shredding clothes of an unconscious girl. Waaaay too easy.. Umm.. Not that I've ever tried... REALLY!\\n",

            "content": "Entertainment is a fickle thing. Everyone has different tastes and different opinions, so making a series that satisfies the tastes of every single individual who may come across the series is a fundamental impossibility. Although, the entertainment industry keeps tabs on what has been deemed popular all throughout the course of history, and if nothing else, they use it to their advantage. While certain aspects of entertainment may be popular, that does not always guarantee those aspects can improve the quality of a title. These things could be criticized as the intentional use of said aspects in order to draw in viewers and have thempay for something they may not really be interested in. And what is debatably the most recognized aspect of this kind in the anime industry? Sex. Enter Freezing, a series that I would describe as the gold standard of what a title looks like when you only focus on the viewer's primal instincts, and the characters' chests.\\n\\n\r\nThe driving force behind the series called Freezing is a busty, young woman named Bridget Satellizer, who's reputation as \"The Untouchable Queen\" runs rampant among the other characters present at the university. With blonde hair, a different uniform from anyone else, and the biggest bust of the bunch, her role as the main character is set in stone, and it's apparent from the start. While there are other characters introduced before her, it's hard to recall said characters when comparing them to Satellizer's overall design. While she appears menacing and cold on the outside, she's actually cold and menacing on the inside as well. That is, until the appearance of the other central, yet less important character, Kazuya Aoi transfers into the school. From that point, Satellizer's image as \"The Untouchable Queen\" comes under fire, while a looming threat lingers in the distance.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing about this series that I never understood was its priorities. This is part of my claim that this series is simply a combination of popular anime tropes. At one point, the series focuses on developing the relationship between Satellizer and Kazuya through the role of damsel in distress, as one of them is placed in a difficult situation, while the other rescues them (or attempts to) from their conflict. This is typical in shounen series and Super Mario games in particular. At another point, they focus on melodrama based on testing the bond between the two of them as new characters are placed within the plot. Then there is also the evident antagonist threat, those called Novas, that eventually become a threat to everyone involved at the school and the world. These creatures are written off as unknown creatures with unknown purposes, which may or may not be an excuse for lazy writing. The sudden shift from one situation to another is more distracting than anything, and it shows an unusual desire to move on from a certain plot point into something new, which may also be a result of lazy writing.\\n\\n\r\nEverything I've said up to this point about the plot was basically underlying problems, problems that arise after digging deep into a title and finding nothing. But what isn't underlying is the inexplicable amount of fan service shown on the outside. Sex appeal and the violence. The strongest argument I can give to support my claim is the apparent focus on these two qualities. Throughout every episode, these two qualities make themselves known in almost every situation. Whether the situation stem from tension between characters, the closeness of partners or comic relief, Freezing finds every single possible excuse to show exposed breasts or unnecessary violence. And while the violence isn't as prevalent throughout the series than the skin, it still panders to the whims of the viewer, finding unreasonable excuses to have the characters duke it out and show off their exaggerated weapons and speed. While this may not be a problem, it starts to become expected. And to expect something before it happens takes the pleasure of being surprised by the creativity of writing out of the equation. And what does this series become memorable for? When someone or something repeats a certain action enough, they become what they do, and they're remembered for that reason alone. How do I remember Freezing? Fan service alone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters within Freezing are about as typical as the writing of the series. They display qualities similar to that of other characters from other series. Satellizer is a tsundere with a remorseful past. Kazuya is the equivalent of the male harem lead. Every other character serves to back them up. They each have one quality that defines who they are, and never develop past that. Their designs are a different story, however. Satellizer's appearance is memorable and does well to support the viewer's interest in her life and problems, if not her chest. The uniforms that all other characters wear are enough to draw interest, but some issues arise in the fact that they're either never in them due to fan service, and that their battle armor looks identical to it. Which, in turn, leads to the quality of animation, which is slick and shiny enough to keep even a sloth awake. The art is of higher quality compared to other titles released during that year, but doesn't take any risks to ensure a place in history. It's well done, but it's nothing different. And with the glorious amount of exposed sexual features, it's within my power to state that they're well done, but with how much it's shown, anyone would expect them to pay attention to detail.\\n\\n\r\nIn a society where money is everything, it's easy to assume that titles like Freezing will be prevalent far along in the distant future as much as they are today. As long as sex and violence remains a popular spectrum in the minds of viewers and they use their money accordingly, these things won't disappear anytime soon. At this point, those against it have to at least applaud their durability throughout time. And to those who are so against it, perhaps they should take the chance to see how it can be improved in the future. Fan service is not a bad thing. It lets the viewer identify with the writer or writers of a title and provides them with evidence that these writers had them in mind. But that isn't to say that a series should only rely on fan service, as there are other parts to a story that need to be constructed in order to make a quality work. This statement is both controversial and a gateway to debate. A debate that I hope everyone will take seriously and will take into consideration when watching series in the future. What makes a title successful? Its revenue or its attention to quality? Freezing is a good example of this, as nothing of its quality outside of fan service could be considered good in any sense.",

            "content": "I'll have to say, the reason I started this series is because the introduction summary reminded me of Ash and Pikachu XD. But besides that, Freezing is a definite different from anime i have watched so far. \r\nPlease remember that this is my own personal opinion, whether you find it distasteful or outright wrong in your viewpoint, is your own valued perspective.\r\nStory: The story is original, although it has the overused theme of aliens coming to earth for reasons unknown other than destruction, a typical fanservice-harem anime was easily revealed when the main roles were given to sexy teenage girls with giant racks and fetishesfor younger boys. They attempted, and accomplished well to have a good amount of action and shounen aspects which I found the most blatant factor of why this anime was good. The amounts of ecchi were tastefully included, not shoved in your face at every scene, which is a plus, and the overall plot kept you guessing. Near the end however like many other short anime, was rushed dramatically, dropping the amount of effect it has on the audience. My guess was that Freezing never intended to have a second season, but did particularly well,which is why i look forward to it airing in October of 2013. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: The animations for the Limiter's Freezing have to be my favorite, other than that the soundtrack complimented well with the scenes and the art was very good. Although giagantic oppai that are too large for reality do kind of disagree with me, they kept it fairly under control. Respect points for that. The action scenes were well done too,with enough gore to add effect, but not too much to make you lose your lunch, it was done thoughtfully.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The personality traits is mainly what i look for in characters, that said,some characteristics were standard in all harem anime, but who can deny the desires of the audience =P. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i enjoyed this anime series and i recommend it to any that enjoyed similar ones such as, Pokemon (XD), Date a Live, Guilty Crown and possibly Angel Beats! fans.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER\\n\r\nThe ending really got me hooked on expecting a second season.",

Pandora is fighting against creatures called \"Novas\". Only girl can become Pandora. Pretty convenient for fandom, right? Well, Media Factory at least thinks so.\r\nArt (7/10)\r\nI have nothing to complain about here. Graphics seems pretty good. There were few too bright scenes, but that is all.\r\nSound (4/10)\r\nThis is probably first time I have said so, but I NEVER saw opening so much NOT fitting into show as here. Song is not bad itself, but seeing it with animation mademe wonder if it was written for this show. Rest of sounds was decent. Background noice was just like you would expect it to be. Still this feeling after opening lingers in me...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nBridgett. 'Nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10)\\n\r\nTOO MANY PANTSU-SHOTS! There were quite few in manga too, but what we saw here was just disturbing. There is something as restraint. Some people should remember about that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\r\nI'm dissapointed in this. After manga I was expecting something of at least decent quality and I saw what was done many times recently. Proving that fandom counts more than quailty.\\n\r\nI'll update this review later, at this point there weren't many things to be said. At this point I can feel only dissapointment.",

The overall graphics and sound quality may not be as high as some of the new productions, but the story is very interesting. \r\nI only wish the anime was longer than 13 episode because only the surface of the story can be portrayed in such a short format; only a brief back-story to why the world is in its current state is discussed. \r\nWith that being said, I really like thetwo main characters and the romantic feelings between then.  I like the idea of the super fine girl who no one wants to get involved with, due to her perceived personality and background, has an immediate reaction when she first meets the new guy, who may not look like much but definitely has that kinda hidden inner strength and swagger that any main guy should have in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I've only watched 4 episodes, I truly like the idea of the story and the development between the two main characters; I only hope the show continues in a good direction and doesn't turn to crape.\\n\\n\r\nThe main negatives:\\n\r\n - graphics aren't the greatest, buy definitely aren't bad\\n\r\n - same with the sound\\n\r\n - some might say the intro is bad but who cares about the intro and ending credits anyway, I never watch 'em\\n\r\n - a little nudity never hurt anyone, but pointless excessive nudity can just get annoying, this show edges on too many pointless boob shots\\n\\n\r\nMaybe this wasn't the best review but I'm sure the best thing I can tell you is that you'll either hate it or love it, hopefully it's the latter of the two.",

According to info, it is said that she was implanted with stigmata from Aoi's sister which may partly explain why she didn't instictily attacked Aoi when he touched her and later on develop a brother sister relationship with him, eventhough she doesn't want to perform a baptismal with Aoi she does wants to bond with him. She's born of noblity, but she also experience a rough childhood in the hands of her half brother molesting and abusing her, but she was saved by her elder half-sister. She's a regular at a Queen Burger stand in the school's canteen always ordering a lot of cheseburgers.\\n\\n\r\nAoi Kazuya - At frist Satellizer avoids him, later on she takes his offer to be her limiter on the condition that they will not performed a baptismal, his realtionship with Satellizer is that of a brother and sister relationship. He's the only limiter who can use freezing without being baptize, him being close to has more to do with the respect that he earned from Satellizer for standing out for her even at the cost of his own life. Also according to info, her sister is also a Pandora who risked her life to save the reamining Pandoras from the Nova's onslaught, surprisingly his attraction to Satellizer has to do with her resemblance to his sister, who also goes by the name Aoi Kazuya.\\n\\n\r\nClipton Arthur- who's is Roland Genessa's boy bitch and Aoi's friend, he's always seen with Hiiragi Kaho and one would mistaken him to be her Limiter.\\n\\n\r\nMably Elizabeth - Satellizer's next opponent, I think.\\n\\n\r\nLinchen Rana - a tibetan Pandora who has hot's for Aoi.\\n\\n\r\nFairchild Chiffon- she's the president of the west genetics student council, and may soon to be Sattllize's opponet.\\n\\n\r\nI have no words to say as to why the rating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: a very good 8.\\n\\n\r\nDon't ask.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: a fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nHey, this anime is more about fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nthe end.\\n",

            "content": "After watching the first 10 of 12 total episodes, freezing has been more addicting and easier to watch than I expected. It does a lot of things I like, things that give a feel-good feeling (and I'm not talking about the fanservice here, which is nearly constant, btw). It also mostly avoids some of the common annoyances of the action, ecchi, romance genres that tend to turn me off of a series. I'll explain all this in a moment.\r\nThe setup:\r\nThe underlying premise isn't anything special. You've got a school that trains students solely for combat. The girls are powerful fighters with lots of abilities, butthey need the support of the boys for a special power that only the boys have called Freezing. This relationship generally requires compatible males and females to pair up and develop strong bonds (in other words, become close as boyfriend/girlfriend). Fine. Accept it. It serves as a good excuse to add romance and sexual tension to the ecchi, which is always a good addition to otherwise mindless ecchi.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story:\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't anything complex or unusual. While you might think the story is supposed to be about fighting aliens from another dimension, that really isn't the focus of the story. That part of the story is just developed slowly on the margins until the final episodes. In fact, the aliens don't become a factor until the 9th episode, as part of a multi-episode climax. Almost all the fighting before then is between the heroine (Satellizer el Bridget) and the other girls. And even though fighting happens in each episode, I wouldn't exactly say it is the focus of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\n#1 reason to watch, romance/tsundere:\\n\\n\r\nThe focus of the story is mainly on the development of the romance between the main hero, Kazuya Aoi, and heroine, Satellizer. This is one of the feel-good aspects of the show I mentioned at the start of this review that I really enjoy. The heroine is a tsundere, not the kind that is violent and abusive, but rather the kind that is shy and normally a loner. She's actually feared by most of the other students and thought to be ruthless. But the Hero Aoi, who is a transfer student, is unaware of her reputation and so treats her kindly and without fear, which is new and unexpected for the heroine. This leads to all the cute feel-good stuff that usually happens with this kind of thing in anime (it's why we love tsunderes). Note: there is also some harem type romantic action from a competing love interest which sparks some jealousy, but it's mostly friendly rather than a bitchy cat fight.\\n\\n\\n\r\n#2 reason to watch, hero and heroine being impressive/cool:\\n\\n\r\nAnother feel-good repeated feature of the show that I really like is the way that the 2 main characters (who you'll probably be rooting for) continually impress others by greatly exceeding expectations. Much of the fighting involves other students trying to put them in their place and humiliate them, but they manage to turn the tables and be the ones doing the humiliating, and being awed and respected in the process. They are constantly showing us new, more advanced abilities that they shouldn't have. They take bravery, defiance, and perseverance beyond the limits. It's fun to watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting, not bad and possibly pretty good:\\n\\n\r\nI typically don't care for fighting-based anime. But I actually looked forward to the next daunting challenge each fight brought here. I didn't feel the fights were random or forced. I thought there was a very believable purpose to each fight. Each was nicely more epic than the last. Each had a distinct sense of progression and unique challenge. Thankfully, the fights aren't done in a corny shounen way where they yell and shout and it suddenly results in them being stronger. Instead, the battles are a bit more technical and skill-based rather than being based on grunting and getting pumped up mentally. They were pretty cool. The sound effects and music added positively to the coolness as well. The art wasn't anything spectacular, but I didn't think it detracted from the scenes either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFan service:\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show is absolutely full of fan service. I can't complain. I like it. It doesn't get in the way of anything. It's just there and can just as easily not be there without changing anything. All the girls look great. Boobs are larger than average, but not excessive. Though, I suppose I can complain about the one time early on that the hero sticks his face in the boobs of the heroine to hug her and is oblivious to how awkward that is. I don't like ridiculous stuff like that, but thankfully that is rare here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fairly typical. Not many surprises to be had there. The fighting is at least better than average. Fan service is there in force, if you like that. But the real draw for me was 1: the cute tsundere romance and 2: the awe-inspiring displays of raw talent and virtues from the two main characters as it gains them the respect and admiration of others. If these two things sound particularly appealing to you, and you don't mind fighting, fan service, or a background plot that spends most of the time being secondary to the romance and high school student based storyline, then I think you'll enjoy this. But if you are watching this for the alien storyline, you might feel that this other stuff just gets in the way.",

            "content": "This is exactly that case, when everything seems to be and not bad, but something is missing. The first thing that immediately attracts attention, it is quite beautiful and high-quality art, locally flavored 3D graphics. Abundance of fan service scenes really pleases the eyes and delivers the present pleasure. Girls are naked about and without reason, be it destruction clothes during a fight, specially adjusted situations or ridiculous accidents and it is necessary admit, that the young Valkyries, but in a different way the warlike-chans ways could not be called, looks like really erotic and attractive! At the same time, the picture is replete withbloody and even very cruel scenes, which, although not very different sophistication and sadism, but quite fully illustrate the scenes of bloody violence and even a frank cut. And that's all it would be good, if not a couple of frankly annoying moments. First and foremost unbearable in this picture, this frank enchantment of all the heroes of the male. While the chan is shown not only from the erotic and bloodthirsty sides, but also with a very nice, you can even say kawaii points of view, guys and especially the main character, exhibited full amoeba and nonentities. It looks so disgusting and annoyingly, that spoils all the pleasant impression of frequent and colorful explosions and mass naked female bodies. The second obvious omission is the romantic component of the anime. Her or generally should not have been or it was necessary to continue and concretize relations of the heroes. It is not possible without a shudder to look at the mutual antics of the characters and the nascent harem, when everything is openly standing still and is not going to move at all in any direction. In history, too many dramatic moments concerning the fate heroes and it is quite understandable why their relationship develops so slowly, but that's why I would like specifics and completeness, rather than a frankly cheap fanservice ending in style main character blunt brake, and all the women undress before his eyes. In general, these moments pretty spoiled impressions, but due to ART and bloodthirstiness still deserves the 9/10.\\n\r\nBonus anime ending song just 10/10 erotic masterpiece and EARGASM!\\n",

            "content": "Screw this show!\r\nI found this show via an advertisement on a youtube. I mistook it for another series I'd been looking for and watched the first episode and wow...I'll start by saying that this is easily one of the most shallow anime I've ever seen in my life (And that's saying something). Characters with little to no unique defining qualities combined with a story that just copy and pastes cliches and settings from other anime come together for the sole purpose of showing breasts. \r\nIt's a cross between Neon Genesis Evangelion and Sekirei (A less painful anime show that at least tries to hide itsintention). Don't believe me? The story is that in the future, the human race is under attack by a mysterious race of aliens/robots (Evangelion) and the only defense we have is a race of genetically altered super-girls who (Here's the Sekirei part:) depend on a respective male to reach their full power, or neutralize them. The latter act is called 'Freezing', yes that's where the title comes from, and yes it's incredibly stupid to call it that. From what I can gather, the actual act of Freezing plays a relatively small part in the show, it'd be like if Star Trek was instead called 'Teleporting'.\\n\\n\r\nI wont dare list the character's names, that'd be insulting to my intelligence. This portion only furthers my point that the show exists for fanservice, and to exploit sexuality at every turn. For instance, the show starts with with a generic boy character meeting up with his long lost sister, who is one of the 'super-girls' as mentioned above. After years of separation, he sees her and does what any flesh and blood relative would do, he puts his face between her enormous breasts and begins to motorboat her. I'm not even kidding. At all. That's just the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThis show follows the Ikki Tousen logic (I wouldn't be surprised if these shows were somehow related, though I honestly don't know). By Ikki Tousen logic, I mean the moronic physics and laws like \"tap to a girl's stomach=shirt exploding\" and \"Bigger breasts=better female character\". And I'm not joking about the first law either. It's just like Ikki Tousen and Master of Martial Hearts, in that whenever there's a fight, if there's a girl involved her clothes come off immediately. And they're not cut off or burned off, that would make too much sense. Like the other two shows, the girl would get punched or hit with blunt force, and her clothes would just magically disintegrate. Looney Tunes has a stronger sense of physics than this!\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, this show actually has a somewhat interesting visual style. It's as if one of the animators just felt bad and decided to put forward actual effort. The backgrounds and designs of the robots are actually pretty good, and though the fight scenes are terrible, the attacks are unique and look pretty darn cool. The only part the visuals really take a turn for the questionable, I'll get to that soon.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else I forgot to mention: forgettable voice acting, forgettable music, forgettable everything else. And, the part of this show that absolutely fascinates me and perplexes my mind for hours on end, the detail of this show that will likely have anyone with sense scratching their heads: This is a show about tits. Yes, there's some alien invasion BS going on in the background but it's about breasts. Now, with that understood, why do the breasts in this show not have areolae? The boobs are huge and get a lot of screen-time, but there's no visible difference in color from the breasts to the nipples. It's like someone got a naked barbie-doll and put tiny little bumps on it. Now I probably seem like a serious pervert, but when you really look at the context of the show, you can't help but wonder why boobs are drawn this way. And normally I wouldn't care, but as I said, they're the only reason this show exists, and they're thrown in your face every couple of minutes. I think every female character has her bare breasts shown almost as much as her face, so with that said, why don't they actually look like breasts? Whatever, just another area Sekirei has over this show. And when Sekirei is better, you just know it sucks.",

            "content": "Based on the first ten episodes of Freezing, I have come to the decision to write a quick review to give you an itch on what it's all about. For the impatient, this is an Ecchi anime with a fair amount of fan-service but equally as good characters and story. The art and animation is decent enough that it will not deter from the overall enjoyment of the anime and the characters each have backgrounds which are briefly explained at varying levels at some point. I enjoyed this anime, if you are a fan of... fan-service, then. Enjoy yourself ;)\r\nThe story is pretty interesting, girlsand guys take on roles to use somewhat interesting abilities. It takes place in a school, from the eyes of a young male protagonist, based on the make-up of how the roles are set, it's normal to see younger males pairing up with older females. Considering the rating of this anime and the \"Ecchi\" tag, you can imagine what it's all about. It does however pick up a lot of depth towards the end, nudging you towards the edge of your seat in anticipation as more exciting events unveil.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty standard just as the animations are. Do not expect jaw-dropping visuals unless you're asking about the fan-service stills growing like mushrooms on your screen in-between each episode? Yeah, they're okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, there are a variety of voices you can hear. The soundtrack is actually very decent, which took me by surprise. You can expect some interesting orchestral spin-togethers and catchy Opening and Ending sequences.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are fairly well portrayed and as with any decent anime you get a good feel for each personality. Each major character has a varying amount of background information shown either in a flashback or self-introductory scene.\\n\\n\r\nBut all in all, I enjoyed this anime and as said at the start you will enjoy it too if you are a fan of Ecchi. There's fighting, fanservice and plenty of cool-down time where you get to know the characters, as well as some pretty decent gripping action towards the end.",

            "content": "Before I start this review I will say: I will try to keep this review spoiler free, and welcome to titsville.\r\nI have mixed feelings about this anime. There are some good aspects. However, if you decide to watch this, you are in for one hell of a ride, to hell. The combination of tits-for-brains characters and constant meaningless fanservice left me cringing and facepalming on multiple occasions. If you don't feel like reading my jumbled thoughts, skip right to the conclusion.\r\nStory:\r\nLets start with the good news. The story was actually quite interesting. Although it could have been executed much better, the story intrigued me enoughto watch until the end despite all the horse shit (which will be discussed later) that takes place from beginning to end. The season finale looked like it was going to be meaningful, but don't be fooled, it's a mediocre harem after all.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one filler-like episode where nothing happens plot-wise. It's in this episode that you see exactly how boring this anime would be without the story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIf you ignore the disproportionate tits and constant meaningless panty shots, the artwork is fairly decent. Most of the fight scenes are decent. Some of the action scenes seemed too slow and lazily drawn, but for the most part, they managed to keep the momentum going. \\n\r\n( '-')b\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also contains some scenes of gore. Although it wasn't implemented the way I liked, at least it was a step in the right direction. An arm or leg falling off illogically here and there, very meaningful ( '-')b (sarcasm). Aside from that, gore is decently implemented for scenes where the tits-for-brains syndrome doesn't kick in to overshadow the blood.\\n\\n\r\nI will now tell you about tits, because it seems to be the heart of the anime. Most of the important characters have over-sized over-sized tits. Not so bad right? Well they sure like to slap it on your faces :). What happens when someone gets slashed? They bleed right? Well in the case of Freezing, you constantly wonder where the blood comes from. When a female gets slashed, blood splatters and the cloth covering their tits shreds off. You will notice that the female shows no signs of slash wounds, her tits are conveniently uncovered and unscathed. You begin to wonder where the blood really comes from, them or their clothes? If you happen to like watching clothes (only around their tits) being torn off randomly and illogically during important and meaningful scenes, then this may be the anime for you. Along with that, they seem to think it's a good idea to slap in as many meaningless panty shots as possible.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (I think this section has spoilers):\\n\\n\r\nThe entire school staff in this anime seems to only consist of two or three tits-for-brains, because that is how incompetent they are. Despite chaos and earthquakes, teachers either are never there to resolve issues, or show up too late. For some reason they seem to only show up when it's inconvenient for the main heroine. FOR SOME REASON, the main heroine is always taking most of the blame even though it's painfully obvious who is at fault.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a social hierarchy in the school between students of different grades. For some reason, most of the 3rd year students who are part of the cast are extremely stupid psychos. I wonder why they are not expelled from the school. I forgot, the staff members have tits for brains.\\n\\n\r\nLet me introduce you to the main villain of this anime, the main character (MC). Are you looking for an MC that surpasses the generic harem MC? Well look no further. Actually, you shouldn't look here at all, because the only aspect in which he excels is... stupidity. Take a generic harem MC, and replace his brain with rocks. Congratulations, your typical harem MC has evolved into Aoi Kazuya! It appears that this MC has no sense of common decency whatsoever. During times of crisis he gives out some cool speeches, and sometimes they even sound stupid. There isn't really much depth to this character. Make an MC, throw in some random \"cool\" speeches, make the girls love him for no reason, and don't forget the overdose of idiocy.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the MC, the main heroine seems to be likable... at first. The main heroine was intriguing. I wanted to know more about her past and why she behaved the way she did. Oh I found out all right, that she is probably delusional. Her backstory contradicts the way she feels for the main character, and she seems to only act like that towards him for... hold on, there is no reason whatsoever. Go harem MC power ( '0')/\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nFor god's sake, stop moaning when you transform. Other than that, it seems pretty normal, except for the MC's annoying voice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nIt pains me to watch a potentially good anime being destroyed by excessive fan service, illogical events and characters that lack common sense. Despite the horse shit, the story was interesting, the action scenes had momentum, the animations were decent (excluding fanservice), and the main heroine was interesting (until the later episodes that is).",

The reason the Anime are associated with being such a low caliber comes from the fact that most of the ecchi genre places what possibly amounts to to much emphasis on the fan service.  That doesn't mean though, there aren't shows in the ecchi genre that actually have quality to them.\r\nFreezing, despite sharing similar attributes to Claymore, happens to be one of those Anime that stands out as having quality to the storyline despite being of the ecchi genre. Sure, theseries has plenty of fan service, but none of it is forced and every shot is actually believable within the context of the story. There is no pushing \u201cthe willing suspense of disbelief for this story.\u201d Every step is thought out.\\n\\n\r\nThis includes the artwork and the characterization. All of the action scenes flow realistically, not to mention this is one of those shows that as I've said before, due to the subject matter, would be hard to pull off without the ecchi moments.

No... the girls are allowed to stand on their own two feet.",

            "content": "'Freezing' is an anime that people will approach from several different angles. There are the people that will be watching for the outrageous fight scenes,  and others will watch for the ample fan service. What surprised me at the conclusion of the show was that I thought back on the series as, first and formost, a futuristic apocalyptic tale in the same realm of subject matter as Neon Genesis Evangelion. It is a return to the subjects of a show that created a surge of more adult-themed stories and content in anime. Every rose has its thorns, as the show itself says, so let'sdelve into the components of 'Freezing.'\\n\\n\r\nStory: I will try not to give away the best bits! Basically, the story revolves around a highschool-aged group of female superstrong Genetics soldiers and their slightly younger male partners, whose power combined is just enough to fight Genetic's greatest foe, the Nova. Right from the beginning, this show flaunts the extreme violence that comes with training for war. We meet the main characters, Sattelizer and Kazuya just as a \"carnival\" (read: masochistic annual tournament) is wrapping up, with Sattelizer as the heavy favorite in the second years. The late transfer student and the secluded, tormented fighter makes for a great story of reconciliation and selfless love. We get to see the characters as they fight over school politics, war partners, and each other's hearts. The story has a tendency of showing emotions through protracted fights rather than dialogue, and there were a few points where I just wanted to shove two characters in a room and make them talk. It's frustrating when the source of drama is sometimes just silly miscommunications or assumptions, but I guess these fighters and defenders of the earth are a tad egotistical and self-involved. It comes with the territory.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time you're wondering just where the show will go with its fleshed out leads, a large attack befalls Genetics, and Sattelizer and Kasuya find themselves right in the middle. The emotional plot really does play into each character's effectiveness as a fighter, which makes the story much more enthralling. I loved the last four episodes. They were dramatic, had some great twists in the fight, and generally made the show. The stakes feel high in the battle, and I was caring for the different characters, as their survival did not seem to be assured. Now, here's some not-so-sweet news: there is a good amount of boobs and poses thrown into this anime, and though it is almost always related to the fights (as their ever-shredded stigma fabric suits are indicative of their condition), some will see this as gratuitous and pointless. And as I said before, the fights can last quite a while, robbing the viewer of more character development or general setting about the outside world.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The character designs for everyone is great. We see many nationalities at Genetics, and it actually shows some in their look. Also, every Pandora's a babe, and you will be seeing many a pair of fight-revealed titties (for better or worse, this show is a kind of ecchi), and if it's important to you, they are quite the mammaries. The fighters use a variety of tactics and weapons in their fights, and oh are the fights extraordinary! Great animation paired with a visceral feel of classmates/comrades fighting all out (thank goodness for their magical hospital!) makes for exciting fights that feel like they have lots of power behind them and real consequences. Both the fights and the more dialogue-heavy scenes are well-animated, with good, strong emotions coming through with most of the characters. CGI is used for some of the special moves in a way that blends well with the drawn characters and enemies.  It looked like it belonged in the fights, and I think that's the best compliment I could give. Blood and gore are present, but never gratuitous, and the expressions of pain that comes with each hit looks the part. Settings can sometimes be bland-- the school is pretty, I guess, and the city in the last arc does give off a futuristic vibe, but sets in the Genetics compound and during fights are dark and spartan. This is a more generic future than NGE's Nerve center, and the beautiful landscapes of that world. The most important parts, though (the characters, the fights, and the enemy design) come out as the focus, and these elements more than make up for the lack of pretty sunsets.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP is fairly good, and this is coming from a chronic skipper. I found myself humming along often, and the montage during the song is a good overview of the characters and their job: kicking ass to protect the world. The ED is more techno, and has stills behind it rather than animation, but it's still a catchy tune. The soundtrack is usually servicable techno, some piano. It gets the job done. I thought the seiyuu performed admirably. Sattelizer and Kazuya are well-done by their respective actors. There's a \"rural\" character in the show, and her dialect sounds different even to me, a complete japanese newb. Everyone has great force behind their lines during fights, and especially at the end. Overall, a great and even effort. Also, the sound design for the fights and Nova are great. The special moves really pick up intensity when their sound effects give some weight to the punches and slashes. Oh, and that sound the Novas make? It's really creepy and scary. The sound helps make these behemoths seem menacing and frightfully dangerous.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The crux of this show is the relationship between Sattelizer and Kazuya, and as they draw closer to each other, both of them have to look back on their lives and their motivations to fight before they can handle a Nova fight. Sattelizer had a traumatic childhood, but in the beginning, all you can think is \"ice queen\". Who better to thaw the Untouchable Queen's heart than Aoi Kazuyah, the brother of the deceased hero of the last Nova war? There's plenty of meat on these characters, and seeing Kazuya's iron will and its affect on Sattelizer makes for good drama, most of the time. It seems like they pulled the rug out from under our feet at the end, though. We never get to see the result of them caring for each other, this \"baptism\" of sorts, which cheapens the conclusion of the series, in my opinion. Though the other, secondary characters also have varied and refined personalities, the focus on fights and the main two mean that you'll be left reading info cards after the commercial breaks to learn about the other fighting vixens. Lana, Ganessa, and Chiffon are all great personalities to have around Sattelizer and Kazuya, but I just wish I knew more about their stories. In the end, the characterization are meant to lend emotional power to the action climax of the show, and for all my complaining, it worked!\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. I started watching for the fight scenes and boobs, and ended up staying for the exciting, world-in-the-balance conclusion. This is an adult anime that eschews the ditzy humor of most ecchi for a serious sci-fi story of love and sacrifice. About the 20th time a blade cuts of a girl's clothing but not her skin, you realize that fanservice is a big part of the show, but by no means is it the biggest. If you can't stand these parts, ask yourself what the difference is between this and the naughtier bits of Rome, True Blood, or Weeds. Adult shows have some T&A, get used to it and just watch the censored version if you're too boob-shy. There are some niggling issues with bland-ish settings and Sattelizer's crushing inability to talk to Kazuya about important things in a normal manner, but these are all small imperfections on a generally good, sometimes great futuristic sci-fi action series.

            "content": "Freezing is a true embodiment of what makes shounen, well shounen. A butt load of action, and a lot of naked butts to go with it. Of course, that is a very simplistic and 'large in identity' assumption of me, but that is the type of eye candy we usually get. I have to say, despite my open distaste for fanservice, I have to admit that Freezing is pretty good at hitting the sweet tooth it aims for.\r\nThere are a lot of things that work against this show; firstly the plot is very slow and somewhat shallow as every girl, in this academy pandora, decidethey want to pick a fight with Satella. Despite it being faithful to the manga, the ending arc which has actual relevance to the setting seems as if they just wanted to have some actual plot. While it is nice it has a lot of action, this is what ends up limiting the story of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is solid and pretty enjoyable, and it damn right should be seeing how it takes up some much screen time. I wouldn't be wrong to judge that at least a third of the show is spent with weapons drawn. The girls each have their own special pandora weapon and after watching the opening battle you know that nobody is pulling their punches as the blood rains down.\\n\\n\r\nOf course our female lead might be a little uptight and tsundere, but her background fully justifies her behavior, and allowed me to sympathize with her a lot. The same can not be said for our pathetic clich\u00e9 male lead. He is completely stupid and head over heels for Satella, but unfortunately we can't have a bad lead right? So they made him the most powerful limiter* in existence - The pandora's male companion who can use 'freezing' to stop the enemy movement. This is another shounen aspect in case you weren't wondering, where the main character pulls tricks out of his butt without having any idea why he is special. The rest of the pandora's we meet are average characters without much depth, but they aren't horrendous either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFreezing is an okay watch if your looking for something that is easy to follow. It doesn't have very good characters or story, but it maintains a high level of enjoyment despite these weaknesses.",

I found that the Nova weren't really focused on at all until the last episodes, but the first half of the series was entertaining and flowed nicely. The story line is episode-by-episode for the most part but easy to keep track of. \r\nArt/4\r\nThe characters were physically distinguishable - if only by hairstyle for all the redheads but I mean. The breasts were unnatural and vaguely uncomfortable to look at, since they more like resembled balloons that jutted outwards. Ehhh. Allin all I didn't find the art particularly unique, pretty average. \\n\\n\r\nSound/8\\n\r\nI watched the English dubbed version  and I loved it! The voice actors were well matched to their characters. It was pleasant to listen too, nothing felt phoney or forced. I highly recommend the dubbed version! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter/7\\n\r\nSatella's whole character was really admirable to me. I realize that she might be viewed as cliche, but when we were given her backstory and then guided through her character development it was so easy to sympathize with her. Her never-give-up personality makes her fun to root for. She's a strong female character who is finding genuine affection and companionship for the first time. It made me like Kazuya's character as well, since he was the one who was the first to fight for her. I found the two of them very likeable and of course it made the series that much more enjoyable! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/7\\n\r\nThis isn't a cute, fluffy series to watch if that's what you're looking for - but if you're looking for a short series with lots of action, that ecchi element, and some interesting characters, I would say give this a shot :)",

The series also includes some great humorous scenes and acts, some great romance sub-plots and plenty of action.\r\nA little warning though, despite all the said above in favor of the series, the series' storyline tends to get somewhat confusing if you don't pay enough attention to the details, and there's some new and nifty terminology to it thatyou must pick up early, or you'll miss a lot.",

            "content": "If you are reading this because you have not yet seen this anime and are trying to see whether or not this is the right show for you, then please keep in mind that this review is of my own opinion that may differ from you own, so keep your own personal tastes in mind. If you have already seen this anime and are reading this then you're kind of just along for the ride.\r\nStory/Characters:\r\nThe story for freezing is set in a semi-futuristic world where humanity is under threat by inter-dementonal aliens called Nova and young girls; augmented with superpowers named Pandora are tasked withfighting them (Read the synopsis).\\n\r\nFreezing from the very get go has a pretty solid concept and story with a few sci-fi things sprinkled here and there and enough lore to flesh things out and in fact the story is probably one of this anime's strong points, but if only it could focus on that all the time. This anime; being included as Ecchi has it's fair share of fan service and occasional female nudity, I'm just letting you know so this doesn't come as a surprise.\\n\r\nDespite all of that the story alone still holds it's own with some consistent action sequences featuring some pandora vs pandora combat. It's doesn't have the greatest story in the world but this anime defiantly had me watching one episode after the other and I wasn't disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, the characters to some extent were a little weaker than the story but with some exceptions. Kasuya; the leading male protagonist didn't seem all that interesting to me, sure most of the story was seen through his eyes and there were a few things we got to learn about his character and he develops a good working relationship with Satellizer the Female MC but he unfortunately still came off as a little dull to me. Another character that's kind of weak (in writing) was Rana who comes in later in the series, Rana's only real purpose in the story seemed to be to create a love triangle between the main characters and despite proving useful sometimes, this anime really could have done with out her.\\n\r\nTo end this section on a good not Satellizer; the Female MC I mentioned before, was probably the best character in the whole series, and that's something I don't say lightly. This character is introduced as a badass with a hard exterior and prefers to have people at arms length. I won't say anything more other than that there is a lot more than what is seen on the surface, which is uncovered over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt/sound:\\n\r\nThe art and animation is another strong point in this anime, the action sequences were really well choreographed and character designs were really good, especially for the female characters.\\n\r\nThe music though I don't remember any of the particular tracks from the OST was pretty solid for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nSub/Dub:\\n\r\nHonestly I wouldn't really suggest one version over the other for this anime, though I will mention that Funimation did a pretty good job with the dub, as for watching it subbed, I had a pretty similar experience with it, so my suggestion would be to go with what ever you feel comfortable with.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nI'm going to give this a 7 out of 10, this anime isn't perfect with all it's fan service and love triangles but I have to give credit where credit is due and say \"hey, this wasn't half bad.\"\\n\r\nI would almost suggest watching this if you want to see something with fanservice for the sake of watching fan service, that way you also get a good story out of it as well.",

But then she gets to see a boy called \"Aoi, Kazuya\". She starts to get feelings for Kazuya and let him touch her body, normally she nearly killed people who touched her. After that Kazuya wants to be her Limiter but she is too shy to accept and confrontKazuya, that's actually how the story starts...\\n\\n\r\nSo every Pandora girl has an Limiter, except for Satellizer due to her trauma. Normally to fight the enemy Nova, the girls need Limiters who can Freeze the enemy movement. That is only possible if those both partners have done the Baptism (joining). But Kazuya is able to Freeze without the need of Baptism, like his sister \"Aoi, Kazuha\". \\n\\n\r\nSo actually its pretty interesting how the story continues, I really enjoyed this series, hope there will be an Season 2 in future, the ending was open.\\n\\n\r\n======\\n\\n\r\nNow about the rating, \\n\\n\r\nStory 8, is very interesting and enjoyable!\\n\\n\r\nArt 7, the art could have been better, but still its pretty decent!\\n\\n\r\nSound 9, the sound is very good, the effects/fighting sounds are really good, soundtracks was very nice, I really liked the Nova screaming sound!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9, nothing to tell about it, characters are awesome!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9, really enjoyed it, no boring episodes or childish stuff.\\n\r\nBlood splatters, slashed body parts, the fighting scenes are all topnotch!\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, this is my first review in this site since i just logged here and i feel like giving reviews in animes that i personally like or don't like. I'm a great fan of ecchi animes XD so i decided to make this review for freezing that is personally one of the few good ecchi animes around with a decent characteristics. Well, lets no waste time and start!\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story is set in a futuristic wold where the earth is being attacked by aliens called novas that comes from a other dimension. In order to stop it, modified genetically girls are created using some novafragments on them called stigmas in order to fight novas using new abilities, those girls are called Pandoras. The story starts with a young japanese boy called Kazuya Aoi, that enters in a special school that trains both pandoras and limiters(limiters are male partners of pandoras that uses a freezing ability in order to stop the opponent's moviments). As the story keeps going, Kazuya meets a older second year girl called Satellizer el Bridget, that are the strongest pandora of her class but yet she don't have a limiter for her. Kazuya somehow feels attached to satellizer since she really looks like his old deceased sister that died during a nova clash years ago. So he decides that he will become satellizer's limiter even if most of his classmates warn him about She don't like having limiters. And so the story keeps going.\\n\\n\r\nWhere we have see this before? Monsters attacking the earth and the humans...Female warriors were created, using same powers as the monsters for defeat them...a old female protagonist having a newer male partner on her side...? Many animes are like that, a clearly example is Claymore. The story itself is not so original and also have a very slow pacing, with few things explained. What makes interesting and unique are the events, the diffeent setting(futuristic setting) and the atmosphere of the anime that becomes slighty dark as the animes goes but do not expect something deep. For now, i won't critique the story totally since is still in the beginning, Freezing's story is good but it had potential to be better with more things explained.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nI will be mixed in this part, in other words, i will be positive and negative about the art and designs. I personally liked Freezing's art, even if there is no such deep details, i liked it, principally the effects during the fight scenes. What i don't really liked is...some designs of the gils in the beginning of episode 1. I reallyl liked satellizer's design and some other characters'design aswell, but there some girls that...how i say...had some unnecessary designs like very short pants, short shits, short skirts and etc. As i said, i like ecchi animes, but there things that are really unnecessary, like those designs that i told, it makes the girls looks immoral somehow...idk..is hard to explain. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe Op and ED is good, is not so memorable with that feeling of \"want more of it\" , but yet the OSTs were very good. It fits every scene(sad, fight, etc) with  those piano, violin and orchestral marvelous themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nNow...the weakest part of the show, the characters. There are very few FEW enjoyable characters in this show, incluing the main characters of the show, Satellizer; Kazuya and Rana. Well since we started about the main charactes how about talking about them? Lets start then\\n\\n\r\nKazuya Aoi: he is your typical correct and unmotivated shounen hero with those repetitive typic phrases like \"i will never leave you side\" or \"i will protect senpai no matter what\", making girls attached to him. Kazuya is neither likeable or dislikeable, he is a OK character but is not a character that will motivate us or catch us somehow. The problem of kazuya is because he don't have anything new that lock us on him. we have see too many of his kind, thats ends being a boring and repetitive character. 1.5/5\\n\\n\r\nSatellize el Bridget: Satellizer is a typical strong female warrior, with great powers that most of the times you will think she is OP XD. Besides of the being a strong and unstoppable woman, she is very shy and have unconfident mood and also she don't like being touched duo the trauma of her past. Satellizer somehow catches me deep, even if the authors used the same formula on her for being a typical strong character(just like erza, clare, teresa and etc), there is something new , that is her background story that was very unexpected and also very dark, causing us to enjoy the character in some terms. The only thing that i don't like about her is because she constantly says \"i won't lose to anyone\" and she don't have any other interesting phrase. =/ if you repeat this phrase a lot, it will comes a time that you will be sick for always see it, but yet, is a good character. 3.5/5\\n\\n\r\nRana Linchen:She is that agitated happy and confident character and also rival(of love) of Satellizer about Kazuya(since they both start to have feelings for him as the series goes). She is simple, honest and like kazuya, have the \"Correct\" will, also she is attached to kazuya and always plan to be his pandora. Rana is a mixed character because you will feel like her only hole is being a rival of love and nothing more. Is not really interesting but yet you somehow will like it her scenes, since she is a funny character and likeable in the same time. Rana should have a better background story, since she is just a fighter that ends having love for a main character and only that, i was kinda expectating more for this character, but yet, is more better than kazuya that somehow entertain us. 2.25/5\\n\\n\r\nHonorable Mentions: Chiffon Fairchild, Cassie Lockheart, Elizabeth Mably, Ticy Phenyl(when i make the review on freezing vibration, i will tell more about them, since is when they characters gain a little more of focus)\\n\\n\r\nNow i have told about the main characters and some honorable mentions. Now i will tell the problem of the characters variety in freezing....they are just simple...not interesting. I will explain, in the first episodes and more to the near of the final(1-9), is satellizer fightning with diffeent pandoras or a random fanservice. After the pandoras fight with satellizer, they basically...leave the anime, they don't appears anymore and if they do, is just in a scene. Most of the characters don't have a good background story, interesting concepts or developing characteristics, and is just there for fight with satellizer and then leave the anime like it doesn't existed =/. Freezing have a very poorly amount of memorable characters, most of them are annoying or egocentric in some terms, and you will end hating or not likeing them, there times that will don't even care if they appears or no in the scene. Characters are not very well developed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI Pesonally enjoyed Freezing for being a anime with different concepts and environments, set in a future atmosphere. Even with the flaws and mistakes, you somehow will enjoy the fights, character relationships and few stories and events that somehow will lock you even if is not too much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIf you are searching for a deep plot, deep characters, great sounds, great arts and great enjoyment with replay valuable, skip freezing. Freezing is a ecchi anime with, let's say, decent characteristics in terms of Arts, Sounds and few background stories and some interesting events, but this anime have a personal group target, that are the ecchi fans. The story for now is focus in the relationship of Rana, Satella and Kazuya, with a slow pacing plot. If you are fan of boobies, pretty girls, nude, love triangle, fights and some emotional scenes , you will enjoy it, if you don't then don't even watch. Soon i will give my review of freezing vibration...and i have really many things to talk about it.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Good Animation Quality\\n\r\n+Stunning Effects\\n\r\n+Good Atmosphere/Unexpected Events\\n\r\n+Balanced Harem/Ecchi scenes and Fan service\\n\\n\r\n Cons:\\n\r\n- Poorly Developed Characters, not a great variety of interesting characters\\n\r\n-Story have a slowy pacing. Many things left unexplained\\n\r\n-Most Episodes will feel repetitive\\n",

            "content": "PMS the Series... I mean, Freezing... is a show about busty teenage girls with super powers getting into petty fights with each other because they got their fragile egos bruised.  Then a bunch of aliens show up and try to destroy the world.\r\nIn short, if you like sci-fi magic combat anime and are willing to turn off that part of your brain that insists that the good guys actually have some redeeming qualities, you might enjoy this one.\r\nStory: 3\r\nI score it this low because of the setting, which drives the plot.  WORST MAGICAL COMBAT SCHOOL EVER!\r\nLet me explain.  The school claims tobe run with military discipline.  But this is the school's idea of discipline: Upperclassmen can beat up on lowerclassmen all they want, and if the lowerclassmen do anything about it, they get punished.  That's right, this school is like three years of frat house hazing.  It teaches you to hate people stronger than you and take out your frustrations on people weaker.  Throw in the super powers, and the result is clear.  The perfect school for creating super villains!\\n\\n\r\nWait... that's not the goal of the school?  It's meant to train superheroes instead?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  You're kidding, right?  What's that?  You're serious?  Wow.  That is just soooooo lame.  If this is where they train the heroes who are going to defend us against the alien invaders, then I'm rooting for the aliens.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't mind so much except that this drives the plot for most of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI score it a 3 and not a 2 or 1 because of the occasional tender scene between Satellizer and Kazuya.  He's like her very own bad luck charm, but if you can ignore the fact that he inadvertently ruined her life, their relationship is kind of sweet.  Plus I have no complaints about the battle against the Nova toward the end.  Normally I hate it when a show suddenly introduces a new conflict toward the end, but in this case I was so tired of the girls fighting each other that it was actually a relief to see the Nova show up and give them someone else to attack before the school imploded from all the infighting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong; most of the artwork is fine.  I'm just disappointed by the half-hearted job they did on the nipples when the girls get their clothes ripped off in battle.  If they're going to throw out interesting characters and plot in favor of a bunch of boobie shots, they should at least make the boobies look nice.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, in this case there's a perfectly valid explanation as to why the fights involve clothes vaporizing.  The clothes are maintained by the Pandoras' powers.  The benefit is that they can regenerate their clothes instantly after the battle.  The drawback is that when the Pandoras get injured, their clothes take damage too.  Think of the clothes as a kind of video game health bar.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nIt mostly gets out of the way and lets you focus on the fights.  +1 for the eerie howling of the Nova.  Very alien, and very creepy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\\n\r\nI can describe these characters in one word: unlikable.\\n\\n\r\nA really cool nickname does not make an interesting heroine unless she can back it up, which apparently, Satellizer can't.\\n\\n\r\nKazuya is fine, although he's so forgettable that you could swap him out for any other hero in any other anime ever made and it wouldn't hurt the show.  Actually, in most cases it would probably improve it.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is composed of whiny brats who have all the emotional maturity of a bunch of 5-year-olds.  They need to be taken out of high school and sent back to kindergarten until they can learn to play well with others.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nLook, I get it.  Bodice-busting cat fights sell DVD's, and I have no problem with that.  I'm not one of these morally upright types who get offended by the sight of a bare breast.  But I want to watch interesting characters, not walking temper tantrums with boobs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I'll admit I'm not a big fan of serious combat anime, but I try to judge a show on how well it accomplishes what it's trying to do.  By this standard, PMS the Series... I mean, Freezing... fails miserably.  With mediocre characters and a plot that doesn't convince me that what the people are fighting for is worth it, this is one of the few animes I wish I hadn't watched.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, at least they show a lot of boobs.\\n",

            "content": "Despite being a female, Ecchi and fanservice are two things I don't mind in my anime. That is, if it is done in moderation and is not acting as the crutch of the series. Unfortunately, Freezing is one of those anime, one that rides on its fanservice.\r\nNow for an ecchi/ harem anime, we shouldn't come in with high expectations that you're going to get amazing, dynamic characters, a killer story-line, and perfect pacing. 90% of the time you're going to get the exact opposite. Well I came in with my expectations low and by the end of Freezing I had that feeling I hate havingwhen I finish a show: The fact that I just watched something that was either really bad or only decent, when the show could have been so much more.\\n\\n\r\nStory: See, this disappointment mostly came from the story. Its not your typical slice of life harem, its the seemingly less taken supernatural harem, one where it actually seems like its at least trying to have a story. Its got an interesting backstory, where super powered girls called Pandora's are assisted by their male Limiters to eradicate an alien threat in a futuristic world. The original mangaka seemed like they took care in crafting this world and the Pandora's power. But the anime seems to want to focus more on tits and ass. You won't even really see the alien threat (the Nova) until near the end. The anime seemed to only show battles between the Pandora, needlessly squabbling for who knows what and who really gives a shit.And these fights are really there to expose the girls, who's clothes seem to be made out of tissue paper. Long story short: Very interesting concept, not realized to its full potential. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Most of the characters in this show are forgettable. They simply exist to either have their ass handed to them by Satelizer or for eye candy. Most of the female side characters are bitchy, violent, and unlikable. I can't even remember the names or faces of any of the male side characters. They are far and few. The 3 notable main characters are a bit more interesting. Satellizer el Bridget is quite the badass. A few minutes into the first episode you see her whooping ass and tearing her opponents apart. We find out later that she is quite the shy girl in reality, and as the series progresses, she unfolds in typical tsundere fashion. Kazuya Aoi, is probably one of the dumbest things ever. He's not totally unlikable, despite being the stereotypical loser who managed to score a hot girl. But I don't know what else to call someone who shoves his face in the chest of a girl (the UNTOUCHABLE queen at that) 5 seconds after meeting her. Seeing his relationship with Satellizer bloom was one of the more interesting parts of the anime. I don't really care for this guy though. Rana Linchen was my favorite character by far. She's nothing revolutionary or dynamic, but she's funny, hyper, and an interesting rival. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: The insert tracks weren't anything special. The opening and ending themes were good. Now the art...oh the art. This anime doesn't look like it was animated in 2011 at all. It looks like an anime made in the late 90s/early 00's. Characters and backgrounds are bland and flat. You would think that they would have did better in the animation department, seeing as this is an ecchi and the focus is mostly on beautiful busty girls. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well I sat through the whole thing if that means something. I don't mind fanservice at all, but Freezing was a bit much. I enjoyed the fights with the Nova toward the end, and I liked the basis of the story, and even liked the 3 main characters. But I wouldn't say I fully enjoyed this anime. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was interesting enough to keep my attention and root for the main characters but Freezing really doesn't live up to its potential. It has action, it has romance, it has aliens, it has magic, it sounds as if it'd be perfect. If they decided to make a second season with more focus on story and characters with better art, then I'd definetly watch it. But as it stands now, Freezing is just average. 5/10",

Not even a good one, or even realistic.\\n\\n\r\nEverything was so horrible I barely made it to the end of the series, sound was average as was the art which was the reason for this not getting a one.

            "content": "How do you like your boobs? Bare? Ample? Frequent?\r\nIf you answered yes to any or all of the above, Freezing is perfect for you!\r\nIf not, weeeell, you're not going to have such a great time.\r\nI had to mention the boobs at the start because the one of the first thing you'll notice is how much fan-service there is in the show. There is not one single episode where a girl doesn't get her breasts out. Seriously. Not even one. They'll come out during fights after they take a hit on the chest, even if its a punch. I'm not sure how punching somebody makes theirclothes explode, but that's what happens. This, and the frequent panty-shots take you out from the experience. While they would be fine if they were littered about occasionally (gotta keep the viewership interested), the sheer volume of them is just too much, not to mention the timing. There will be numerous serious moments which will be broken because you can see a bunch of panties, or a girl has her boobs hanging out, and this just breaks the atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also throws in some shower scenes for no real reason other than to show off some more skin. And they even change a story sequence from the manga (which it's adapted from) so that they can show off some more boobs, and the intermissions/half-way points in episodes just display the profiles female characters, while showing them off in skimpy-ass clothing. Because, why not?\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a pretty interesting premise (read the synopsis), though it can't exactly be called exactly original. I would therefore have scored this higher, except it doesn't even get onto dealing with the alien Nova until episode 9 (out of 12). That's 3 quarters already into the series. Until then, the Nova are only shown in a couple of flashbacks, and the show just deals with in-school drama, which is far less compelling compared to facing off against towering unknown invaders. Fortunately, when it finally does get to the characters encountering the Nova, Freezing really picks up the pace and it starts to really feel like its going somewhere. The action gets more intense and you finally start to take an interest. \\n\r\nOne small gripe about the show is how some important information is revealed by one character just talking to themselves in order to explain and reveal some plot details. While this does a fine job at explaining what's going on and providing a bit more backstory, it doesn't make much sense in terms of why the character is saying that to nobody.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the art is pretty good. The characters look good, although the main character's breasts just seemed a couple cup-sizes too large. And while the designs aren't unique or anything, they are well drawn. However, the art does suffer when compared to the manga, especially in the design of the 'Pandora Mode' that some characters can go into. In the manga, their outfit changes almost completely, and they have a more sci-fi/battle-suit look to them, but in the anime, the characters just have this white glow around them, without changing the way they look at all. This just seems lazy.\\n\r\nThe Nova look great. They look smooth and elegant, and appropriately alien, while also carrying this sense of power. However, their body parts don't move (although this is probably to create an atmosphere of strangeness around them) and they just hover about. The overall animation for the show is mostly smooth, with only a few occurrences when things look a bit choppy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a big weak point in the series for me, and there just weren't any mains who I liked. Kazuya is annoying and needy, Satellizer is just not likeable due to her personality and Arthur (really a side character later on) is one of the one sycophantic anime characters I have ever seen. I initially like Rana, until she turned out to be very petty. In fact, the only characters who I did like (or at least, not hate) only appeared a couple times throughout the series, and even then, only for a few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I didn't like the music, but that's just my taste (I generally don't like anime music). I felt that the voice acting in Japanese was good, fitting for most of the characters, and I would have given the sound a higher rank, but then I watched the English dub. Many of the voices didn't fit their characters, and at times, the acting wasn't very good and were hard to take seriously. The English dub is pretty horrible. If you're going to watch it, watch it in Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Freezing has pretty good art and animation, but wasn't as good as it's manga source, and an interesting, albeit unoriginal, premise. Unfortunately, the story just didn't get interesting until three quarters into series, and this was too late to completely salvage it. The characters were a weak point as they weren't very likable and while the Japanese language version is fine, the English dub suffers from poor voice-work. The show is brought down from a 6.5, to a 5 because of slow story, poor characters and the overload of fan-service, sometimes even breaking the atmosphere and seriousness of some situations.\\n\\n\r\nStory:5          Art:7         Sound:6         Character:4        Enjoyment:5\\n\r\nOverall:5",

            "content": "VIOLENCE AND DRAMA AND BOOBIES OH MY!\r\nI first started watching this gem when I finished another anime and was confused as all hell at the start. But what I DIDN'T notice is the teeny-weeny text at the start of each episode (I discovered this at episode two) so I went back and everything made sense. *AHEM*\r\nFreezing MAY not be for everyone but for me personally it was my first \"ecchi\" anime and I nearly fainted at the first scene showing breasts as I was watching it at work and didn't know what ecchi was at the time. That aside the story is essentially about findinga partner, which I believe was well done BUT I could live without the confusion of everything leading up to the end. I had to rewatch a couple episodes and figure out what happened to lead up to the climax of this short series. The character development and how they interact with each other was the bread and butter of this show and you would be insane to not give credit to how well it was brought together. You start with a young woman who is extremely endowed with a HUGE detest of being touched and you slowly get to see who she really is with the help of her partner who she reluctantly chose at the last minute. The love triangle is there as well which I enjoyed, it added a few laughs and comic relief which I believe for a very intense anime such as this one needed\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you're into action-packed anime girls kicking ass and asking questions later this is the anime for you and TRUST ME, you will love it just as much as I did",

            "content": "Freezing is one of those shows where it had a lot of potential, to a certain extent, and it didn't use it as well as it could have. Then again, it's also one of those shows that would be better if it didn't use an excessive amount of nudity even during the most serious moments. (Looking at you HOTD)\r\nThis review will be spoiler free.\r\nI do admit, the show was entertaining, though, and there were quite a few moments that stood out to me. I find that the romance was one of the best aspects, although there's an annoying love triangle involved. (Don't get me wrong,love triangles are alright as long as they're not outright fighting over the main character and shoving themselves on top of him all the time.) \\n\r\nEither way, I'll try to keep this review nice and simple. \\n\r\nStory: 7 \\n\r\nThe story is somewhat similar to shows like Attack on Titan, whereas it's a large group of Teens/Adults who are trained specifically to fight off a race of superior beings, defending the planet from it's demise. Despite this, there's actually only one real fight (Well, it's against four of the beings at once, so I suppose it's four fights) against said beings that they're defending Earth against. I give it a 7 because of this, and, due to the fact that they spent more time showing the teens fight each other instead of the creatures, the story wasn't really brought out until the last few episodes. It was somewhat explained in the beginning, but it really all comes out in the end. I just found it ridiculous that the students were killing off each other instead of, you know, the giant alien race that's trying to destroy the planet. \\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe animation is a bit above average. Intense and fairly well animated fight scenes, good amounts of blood and gore, and of course... boobs. Though, when it comes to the boobs, I say they're overdoing it. Now you may ask; \"How can you overdo boobs? They're BOOBS.\" Well, when the show is trying to be serious, like for example, a sad and emotional death, but a large pair of melons is covering the screen (I say this because whenever the girls fought each other, literally the first part to rip off their clothes was their chest, and their boobs would hang out, nipples and all, throughout each fight.) it's hard to take it seriously. Other than that, the character designs are... interesting, I suppose, and overall animation is great, again, above average. \\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI give the sound a 10 because of this show's outstanding soundtrack. Seriously, the soundtrack is just marvelous and made each and every scene better than it actually was. Nice, sad and atmospheric piano tracks during emotional scenes or intense and fast paced full out orchestras during fight scenes. I myself and looking somewhere to get the soundtrack, because it's very well composed. \\n\r\nCharacters: 6  \\n\r\nThe characters were alright. Some typical and annoying characters, such as the proud and arrogant school girl who's rich and calls herself a princess, (including the annoying laugh they do.) and a sort of bland main character in which all he really wants is to protect the ones he cares about. Pardon my French, but most of the girls are this school are straight out bitches. Seriously. I wanted to slap almost every single one in the damned face. All they wanted was to beat up the main characters, to the point of near death, and laugh in their face. They wouldn't leave them alone and it was aggravating. My favorite character, honestly, was the main love interest; Satellizer L. Bridget. At first glance, she seems to be the typical \"Most powerful girl in the school, who is a bitch and tells the character to leave her alone\", somewhere along those lines. This is actually wrong. She's strong, and tends to not talk to anyone, but when the main character, Kazuya is near, the she becomes girly, shy and flat out adorable. Especially with those glasses. Unf. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall it was a fun series to watch. Great action scenes, amazing soundtrack, adorable main love interest and fairly good stand out emotional scenes. The story is average, but enjoyable when it finally reaches it's climax. Apparently it doesn't finish until season 2, which I haven't seen yet, and I've seen that season 2 isn't even better. But, I'll judge that for when I see it. \\n\r\nAnyway, I recommend this for anyone who likes see boobs and butts during intense fight scenes and even emotional ones. Basically if you like shows like Highschool of the Dead for the boobs and action then this show is for you.",

(You kill them this one way, in this one process, every time, oh look people died, new skill!) One of my only drawbacks, (aside from some of the fights) was the art. It just seemed a little outdated,in my opinion. But, otherwise, a very good anime!",

            "content": "Hello people of MyAnimeList and this a review (my first review on this website) that  is written in perspective of someone who absolutely hates Freezing. Hopefully that i can say enough to stir or destroy interest you might have of the show if you plan on watching it.\r\nThe anime follows the likes of Satelizer El Bridget, the owner of the most badass name and greatest breasts in an anime, Kazuya, who's a bit of a dweeb, and Rana Linchen, who's also in the show. The show follows their misadventures in the West Genetics academy.\r\nHere's some things i liked about the anime. After the introductionto the series our eyes are treated to some outstanding animation. The animation studio behind Freezing, A.C.G.T, hasn't done a whole lot on there own from what i know, but notably they are an animation studio that helped with the always incredible Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, so you can expect a lot of cool and flashy fight scenes. The music and sound design are awesome especially in the fight scenes; surely that's expected from Masaru Yokoyama, the guy behind the music of Inuyasha and Queen Blade. Aside from all the action there is an relationship developed between some characters, but I'll let you figure that out for yourselves. \\n\\n\r\nNow here's the bad, which is everything else in the series. I am not generally the type of person who cares about fanservice, but what bothers me is how they go about doing it. Once something is said or done a repeated amount of times, it loses face value every time; so by the third or fourth episode, i just got sick of it. The exact same can be said for the fight scenes, too.... Literally, every episode finds the most ridiculous reasons to have a fight scene or nudity of some kind, and mostly at the same time. The fight scenes are good and everything but instead of blood, cloth ripping has taken it's place, and almost in the exact same spots every time, with every female character, who all have huge boobs because anime. Essentially what I was watching was the anime version of the banned Japanese video game, Battle Raper. There isn't much build up at all to the fight scenes, either. After a while the fights almost feel like they were used as get out of jail free cards in the narrative; it just felt like lazy writing, which this anime is chopped full of. The only thing that is relatively good about the story, is the relationships between some of the characters, but even then it's nothing spectacular. With the exception of Satelizer El Bridget's character, which for some reason in this mess, i absolutley loved, almost all the characters are flat, and poorly developed. After watching it i couldn't tell you the names of most of the characters, the plot, the villains, and the motivations behind them. After the seventh episode, i didn't even know until then that there was going to even be a story. On top of all of this, it's rude, sexist, offensive, and overly sexualizes the daylights out of women so much, that it could make a Michael Bay film blush.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are someone who is into anime souly for boobs and fighting, this show is probably perfect for you! But with the poor writing, lack of story, themeing, character, redundancy of it's fan-service, and overall lack of enjoyment for this series, i can't help but give this anime a negative score.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict 3/10, Poor",

            "content": "I honestly have mixed feelings about this anime. The nerdy part of me, who loves action-packed animes with constant blood and gore, whole heartedly enjoyed this anime. The romantic/over-analytical part of me, could not be more annoyed with certain aspects of this anime that seemed to disgust me.\r\nLet's start with the nerdy side. The action was good. Very good in fact. There was a lot of gore and blood, as well as some ridiculous moves and action sequences I couldn't even possibly imagine. It was very well done, and the plot was definitely interesting and unique. However, I will say that there wasn't as muchaction as I predicted, and some of the battles were all hyped up and somewhat of a letdown. But still, nonetheless, enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe analytical romantic part of me, hated many parts of this anime. If you don't like boobs, naked anime women, a few scenes that could be even considered soft core hentai, then you will not enjoy this anime. It seems every chance the anime gets, there are naked boobs, as though it's just to keep the attention of the 12 year old boys (no offense). But if you're like me, and can handle the ridiculous amount of unenessary nudity because the action mostly makes up for it, then you should still like it. Though, this anime is meant to create a second season, and once again, the huge hype of the ending battle was just a huge disappointment, and there's a good chance that all of these negative factors add up to an anime that you may not want to watch. And as for me always enjoying the romantic parts of animes, this one drove me insane. In the end, I wanted to punch all of the main characters for their ignorance. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, it was a solid anime. A lot of moments I absolutely loved, other moments not so much. I'm interested to see where the second season goes. This anime could be your friend, or your enemy, it just depends on personal preference.",

            "content": "Okay so this show is pretty bad. It's not the worst anime that I have ever seen but its still pretty lame. On a positive note it has good art and music not to mention there are a lot of fight scenes. On a negative note I'm on episode 9 and I'm not seeing where this anime is going. There are aliens called Nova but none have actually appeared except in flash backs. So far it has just been the \"good guys\", Pandoras fighting each other every episode. And there is Kazuya who is a puny little boy who is a very powerful limiter whois obsessed with a powerful pandora named Bridget \"The Untouchable Queen\". Bridget goes on a rampage when ever someone touches her and practically kills them. Except for Kazuya for some reason who accidentally \"motor-boats\" her the first time he meets her in the first episode . Bridget is cold, antisocial, and over all not a pleasant person to be around but Kazuya loves her for no other reason than that she looks like his dead sister from behind? Also the whole motor-boatting incident maybe. Did I mention there are a lot of fight scenes? Well there is about double that number in ecchi scenes. There is a lot of full frontal nudity. Usually showing breasts and nipples. In fact most of the fight scenes are ecchi. It appears all Pandora weapons seem to have the uncanny ability to tear off women's clothes and expose their breasts. Every fight scene in every episode eventually leads to all the pandora battling with bare breasts, almost completely naked. It's like a lame hentai but without sex, genitals, or octopus tentacles. Though I am interested to see when a Nova does finally appear whether or not the Pandora weapons will have much the same effect on them. Nova monster titties. LOL. Another thing I don't like about this anime is every episode Bridget is getting in a fight with another \"bad\" pandora or three instead of sticking with one antagonist a couple of episodes she is fighting a new \"bad\" pandora each episode. Anyways. If you like chicks fighting and lots and lots and lots. and LOTS of breasts. This is your anime. Looking forward to reviewing Freezing Vibrations.",

Action and milk cannons. Why was it bad? Lackluster \"plot\", characters and devices. \r\nYou don't have to read the manga for this one(I sure as hell didn't). There's nothing complex about the terminology or the correlation between characters and plot devices. It's everything you've seen and heard before from any EVA clone: Aliens appear. Humanity is endowed with a means to fight said aliens and itso happens that chicks with lovely milk cannons have to save the world. Oh, and special(useless) males are there to assist these superwomen in the midst of their battles.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has one of the most batsh*t insane, co-conspiring and painfully contrived female cast I've ever witnessed. If this anime was our reality, humanity would die indefinitely. My experience was infuriatingly bad so much so that I couldn't stop watching.\\n\\n\r\nAside from all this, the fan service was top flight and despite my frustrations with this anime I shall go on to watch the specials + Vibrator + specials because I've come this far and there's no turning back.

            "content": "Freezing...a manga that brings up being controversy and mostly shaking heads to anime fans as the amount of fanservicei you will find her, is quite frankly ridicoulous , despite it being an actually good story - if you leave all of the fanservice aside.\r\nHello and Welcome, my name is Ryoki and welcome to my Review of Freezing.\r\nFirst of all lets talk about the setting and story in general ( may contain spoiler so scroll down if you dont want to read this) \r\nFreezing is set in a post-apocalyptic world where supernatural beings called the ,,Nova'' reign terror in the lands of humanity.  Nova aresomewhat like aliens, this  at least is what the anime says. You then immediately see a jump backward so the Pandora can be explained. The Pandora are, you could have guessed, Humanitys answer to the Nova.\\n\r\nBasically by giving them fragments of a nova body, they are able to become a weapon against the nova, like in the good old tale ,, lets beat fire with fire.'' These women are having male companions which they call a Limiter,  in which also Nova fragment have been implanted, granting the ability to create a forcefield which immediately immobilises the target - that is what they call ,,Freezing.''. \\n\r\nThe story focuses on a certain pair or on as a primary point on Satelizzer ,,the Untouchable queen.'' given the name by the fact that no one on the whole campus dares to fight or touch her. Until then the faithful day when the brother of the last pandora heroine comes to the facility. Aoi Kazuya, which still doesnt know anything what is happening on said schoolground until he comes inbetween a fight in which Satelizzer and a second student clash, he mistakens Satelizer for his sister and then holds her back from fighting , making her loose though by the attack of her enemy. He feels bad afterwards, and wants to apologize to Satelizer, even after being warned by the class president Chiffon. And even when being taken into a fight and then even facing a real third year pandora , he doesnt want to leave her side and then eventually becomes her Limiter.\\n\\n\r\nSatelizer on her own is a bit a damaged character , damaged in the way of that she hides her insecureness. She had a very cruel childhood and had to sustain many things and thus searched the resolve to fight on while trying to never loose a fight. \\n\r\nKazuya on the other Hand is like the mirror to her , they resemble a very good pair together. Kazuya on his own is a justice-loving character as naturally after his sisters death he wants to make him self useful and join West Genetics.\\n\\n\r\nArt, i dont really know what to say at this point, the animation on itself is not bad but also not fantastic, what im personally disappointed is at the design choices that the makers took , instead of choosing the way that the manga took. A big example of that is the Pandora Mode, in the manga, you have real suits in which they look final fantasy  styled and really cool. Like here for Ingrid:(please fill the links into your browser , both are directly the pictures i want to show)\\n\r\nhttp://2.p.s.mfcdn.net/store/manga/2212/02-009.0/compressed/bpage10.jpg\\n\r\nAnd now her look in the Anime:\\n\r\nhttps://avvesione.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/freezing-12-ingrid-pandora_mode-battle.jpg\\n\r\nKeep in mind, that is my personal opinion - maybe you will like but I personally shake my head at that. You have absolutely cool and sturdy looking suits for each pandora , which is unique and instead what they chose is a simple glowing...\\n\r\nSo also  the sound isnt really that well done. Themes are supposed to catch your attention and make you pumped up for what is about to come but those from freezing arent really gripping - not for me at least. Neither the opening or ending are really that epic - which should have been necessary for an apocalyptic anime.\\n\r\nEven so , at the end of this review - i'd like to recommend to try this anime at least - at least one episode to see how it goes. I have calculated the overall score depending on my ratings for story, art, sound & and character and naturally also my enjoyment and have given Freezing a solid 6.6 - which would be 7. \\n\r\nI hope this review could help you with your choice if you want or do not want to give this anime a try. Im grateful for you reading all the way through and hope to see you guys in the next review!",

The story line had depth and had the whole \"transfer student surrounded by new people\" and before anyone knew it, he had an extraordinary power.

I've seen better in more recent anime but the art in Freezing defiantly had no room for concern.\r\nThe sound was good, no badly made sounds like in some anime and the intro and outro songs were pretty decent although I have a habit of skipping past them.\r\nThe characters were good. Theyall had their own personalities but after about 4 episodes you could predict how they would act to most situations that they were placed in.\\n\\n\r\nI really really enjoyed this anime. My heart was racing during every scene of it. It had a perfect blend of ecchi, romance, action and comedy in every single episodes and for those more into ecchi; I guarantee boobs and pantyflashes in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was extremely well thought out and prtrayed as a very touching but action filled story.",

            "content": "Freezing\u2019s general plot may seem to be really boring. Well, actually it is. A look-like high school, ecchi (or maybe full of service: I mean, you know\u2026 FAN-one), girls with weapons, girls, girls, few men, girls, wome\u2026 anyhow! Semi-default harem setup, as men do exists, but they\u2019re either ignored, killed, or looked down. Do not expect comedy from Freezing, regardless of this harem setting. It is a really good serious anime; you just have to look for its serious points.\r\nFreezing\u2019s about future and it happens on Earth. We have this military high-school-like made to train its students to destroy an earth-invader race called \u201cNova\u201d. Well,actually, Nova\u2019s have nothing to do with it, as the author focus on character development of a Sattelizer L. Bridget and its relationship with Aoi Kazuya (our hero here), and OMG wow fights.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7\\n\r\nFreezing\u2019s story has one or two positive points on it, but that's not the reason people should watch it. No complex square, pentagon relationship, and no girls-fall-from-the-sky (for the love of God, thanks) setting. Despite that, it has clich\u00e9 and bad points.\\n\\n\r\nIt is an 80% clich\u00e9 made scenario.\\n\\n\r\nA default school, default girls, default service, default giant-not-so-realistic boobs (that's not the point, I know: I mean, anime has nothing to do with reality some times, right?), default environment. Nothing really breathtaking to notice. It is just one more futuristic Sci-Fi anime in the anindustry, though there\u2019s no Mecha here. I guess the author did something original here, since Gundam series drowned all the possibilities of doing similar stories with mechanical parts and sick energy generators on it. First, school. I need to ask myself, why school? Maybe because they torn all other-than-school-clothes and then made people there use school uniforms? Nova\u2019s are school otaku and find hard to invade an Earth that has lots of girls in uniforms? Because creativity is lost? Anyhow, school sucks in this plot because the uniforms: they have so much beautiful female characters and make all of them use the same piece of already-torn-clothe! Girls? They are (excluding some girls) not developed at all, and all we know is her name, weapon and breast size. The environment\u2019s just boring: no new places, no good landscapes, no fine cozy rooms (which would fit some parts at this point).\\n\r\nAlthough it\u2019s remaining 20% make seeing it worth. Romance 9\\n\r\nWell! What you have really here, is the development of a relationship between our two heroes, one male, Kazuya, and one female, Sattelizer. Of course, there are others, but they\u2019re not as heart-warming, out of expectations, neat, and screen-timed. Sattelizer inside weak tsundere personality is fulfilled with Kazuya\u2019s determined mind, and that is worth your time. She had a hard time in the past, and Kazuya is willing to be on her side: but she does not show her true self to anyone, but the newcomer Kazuya. She is just brave and cool, trying to open herself to this unknown guy who hugs her strongly and sticks his face on her breasts (annoying, but nevermind). \\n\r\nThey do give us lots and lots of turnabouts, which makes you dig deeper and deeper into the plot. Eventually, you find yourself hoping they have a good time together, and it all ends well.\\n\\n\r\nOMG Battles make up with the rest. 10^2\\n\\n\r\nBattles are just wow. They don\u2019t recycle a single screen, and that makes my life feels lighter. They are well drawn, well fought. Characters just don\u2019t seem to waste movements (although they seem to waste lots of clothes), and either chat a lot when fighting: for that, when they chat, there\u2019s a real reason to stop fighting or something similar. Animation is great and pleasing when I see anime like that. To be able to balance impotence (when they\u2019re not even able to touch it\u2019s enemy getting pretty worn out and hurt), with a strong resolve (when they are able to surpass all the pain and past, in order to protect the loved one). This way, the story climax and climax all over again: over despair, bravery, perseverance, hate, and love, it won\u2019t disappoint you.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as you can see: service can (but it doesn\u2019t) spoil the idea of serious anime (*1)\\n\\n\r\nA little note: regarding the forced ecchi: you see, there\u2019s LOTS of forced fan-services scenes. Although when they\u2019re shown there\u2019s no escaping, you can notice they focus on it only in the \u201cIT-IS-GOING-TO-RIP=SEEME!!!\u201d and \u201cyou know, bath and getting changed\u201d period. Somehow, I feel they\u2019re ignored when they don\u2019t have a significant meaning to the plot. Like leaves falling: they fall, and everyone\u2019s aware of that, but people don\u2019t worry about it usually. I prefer seeing it as an ornament: it makes those scenes less idiotic. At least, it is not forced as Sekirei, HOTD, or Ikkitousen. Regardless the fan-forced-service and clothe wasting issue, I think there\u2019s no more comments on that.\\n\r\nArt 7\\n\r\nI don't see anything that does stand out in the matter of art in this anime. One thing good to point is that it makes the job done. Characters have the right expression on the right time: annoyed, happy, gloomy, weak, painful, hatred expressions are shown when they need to be, a really good point. It makes some climaxes better, and some serious conversation parts even more serious. Those expressions are not comical though. The plot does not leave so much space to the comedy super deformed heads, which seems to be fair enough, because I find it really hard to find a serious recent anime with no comedy (at all, if I recall correctly) SD shots. Yeah, pantsu and breasts are well done, but this is normally the thing it is. \\n\\n\r\nSound 1/9 (1 for the op/ed, and 9 for the bgm)\\n\\n\r\nIt has some good features on it, but no tear-shredder music, no. Besides, I wasn't expecting too much after hearing the opening and ending, It wasn't that picky. Well, opening seems off its place, since this is not a love comedy eating burguers, it is a battle anime, come on! Ending\u2019s just the sound of water to fill the \u201cI-like-fanserv-chicks-time!\u201d.\\n\r\nEven though, I was able to be pleased with the (anime minus op minus ed) sounds and effects. They do have the right bgm for the right moment. At least it didn't seemed as off-place as the op/ed. They did chose the right bgm for battles, and that makes battles even more thrilling, making yourself really excited when they start \u2013 the music & the battle. Accel bullet-like effect sound\u2019s just too overwhelming to comment. Every explosion is right-timed, and footsteps are according to the screen. If default, a really good default soundwork. And if perfect, I wouldn't say that much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10 (6for support and 10 for main)\\n\\n\r\nWell, till episode 11 of the anime, I know the name of 2 male characters. Seems like they don\u2019t have the impact what it takes to be remembered. Aside 2 of them, the others are just Freezing capable machines. Female characters have their own weapon, sick skills, and blood all over the place! Women are just cooler and easier to remember. Chiffon Fairchild, Cathy Lockharte, Sattelizer L. Bridget, Ganessa Rolland, Ingrid Vernstein! COOL! Anyhow, they do not develop as much as they should. For example, take Rana: she\u2019s more than what the screen shows, but it she wasn\u2019t developed at all. \\n\r\nOn the other hand, main characters are just too well developed: they have reasons to smile, to cry, to battle, to be sad and to to be happy. The author made a good job while triggering Sattelizer events. Sometimes it is relaxing, seeing how can love be so simple and pure, and sometimes is just not romantic and idealistic that sounds banal. Mainly very pure and childish, maybe that way makes us feel like falling in love for the first time. Sweet!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\\n\r\nYES, freezing has a highly enjoyment payload if you like either romance or a tsundere relation. I mainly see it because of the breathtaking turnaround battles making your heart beats faster, and Accel. Otherwise, it will be just a boring with a forced fanservice anime.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m certain that you\u2019re going to like seeing this anime. Well, in its beginning, it really may suck, but as the history develops, you find it very pleasant to get excited with upcoming battles, lame opening, light, very light romance, and a beautiful blonde tsundere.\\n\r\nAlthough these separate parts (story, art, sound, character and enjoyment) suck, alltogether deserves 9!\\n",

            "content": "Having watched a handful of ecchi animes before, I was skeptical of watching freezing, thinking it to be a stereotypical ecchi anime, full of idiotic characters, a plot full of loop-holes, and overall just an excuse for fan-service. But it wasn't long that I was proven utterly wrong. \r\nStory:\r\nFreezing takes place about a hundred years into the future where extra-dimensional alien beings called Nova mysteriously appear out of nowhere and wreak havoc upon the Earth. Mankind's sole defense against these monsters are Pandoras-superhuman girls who fight the Nova and their Limiters-boys with special support abilities.\r\nThe story may seem simple at first but its very uniqueand interesting, not to mention scientific and intriguing. It has been a while since some nascent scientific concept have been introduced in an ecchi anime. And surprisingly, the story gets gradually more and more appealing, gripping and spectacular. The past of many of the characters are revealed as we go along the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just mind-blowing! The girls, much like any other ecchi series are beautiful, stunning, gorgeous and voluptuous. The fight scenes are all very well drawn and their actions and movements are fluid-like and smooth.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, although short is acceptable and is done by Color. The music does well to complement the tense moments and fights and really makes you sit on edge.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAlthough character development is not much, the characters themselves are very interesting and quite a handful, if I might say. However, more character development should've been there but there are only 12 episodes, so you have to cut them some slack.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIt's a bit bland at first but as the story gets going, it really does the anime justice and it's very enjoyable. You cannot stop watching once you start!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, freezing is a dark horse. It may not look it but if you give it a chance, it will surprise you! It's a great addition to my list!",

            "content": "I don't like reviews that take more than a few minutes to read as they just waste your time. So ill try to keep this as short as i can.\r\nStory 7/10:  Overall I think they do a good job of mixing the story and backgrounds of characters in with the fight scenes and the flashbacks very rarely bore me. However, they do have some instances where they could have gotten across the same idea in half the time, and that bugs me. The storyline does match the Manga fairly closely so far, with only small things being switched out/in but everything else remaining thesame.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: Everything looks very good to me visually, I can't spot any crappy artwork or strange movements in the characters for the most part. I also think that the artists did a good job of showing 2 sides (Cute and Shy and Badass) to Satellizer L. Bridget in how they portrayed her. The only reason I gave this score an 8 instead of a 9 was because every once in a while I might see a face that just looks weird to me (this has only happened 2x in 7 episodes for less than 5 seconds) \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: The sound really makes you enjoy the fight scenes and magnifies the experience quite well. The opening and closing songs aren't bad or weird in any way. Unless you try hard to focus on some inner meaning (which there isn't one really).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10: With the exception of the main characters Aoi Kazuya and Satellizer, not many characters get fleshed out and have much depth so far. I believe this might change the most as the anime comes to a close in the last 5 episodes. But overall they did a good job with the time they had.\\n\\n\r\nEnoyment 8/10: Once you get past all the Ecchi its a very good Anime series that can keep you thinking about whats likely to happen next. I am always looking forward to the next episode. I recommend you watch these Anime all in one big session if you can, it will make understanding and the enjoyment of the series just that much better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: With the exception of a few things that bug me here and there, I really enjoy this anime, I will definitely be waiting for each of the last 5 episodes to come out.",

            "content": "Gonna try to follow the guidelines this time..... Never read the manga which i heard was better but since i haven't read it im going straight off of what i watched in the anime.\r\nStory-  It had all the genres that it was given down to a pact it had alot of fighting(action), Drama during alot of the fight scenes it had the ecchi i didnt really think it needed it but it doesn't ruin or cause any problems in the story  it had romance between the main characters but since its not solely that genre its not as prevalent as you would wantto had the sci-fi factor within the weapons and the characters abilities etc its a harem also is a seinen so it caters to older guys but whatever. OG(original) story but uses the theme of many other anime when it comes to the enemies and what not being random and come out of nowhere and just cause destruction the story was very good but in the harem portion its very generic typical fan service so big breast attractive essentially attracted to the young guy who does something bold and they randomly are into him this is nor sexual or from the use of words but like every harem the girls eventually want him... All i can say is the fan-service doesn't really distract you but sometimes you don't really want it there but the  fighting is what will really keep you interested so all in all a good story few cliche things and few flaws but good.\\n\\n\r\nArt- well done although it isn't the most beautiful top of the line when it comes to the visuals but Great visuals during the fight scenes The blood and gore factor is in the middle nothing super crazy which is great because its not something that will make you just not pay attention. its good dont really have anything bad to say about it. (Not censored)  \\n\\n\r\nSound- Art and music get the same score because both complimented each other well the fighting scenes and the music playing during it fit well nothing bad to say about the sound department either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- It was fair to say at best no character really gives you the emotional attachment or just liking that you need in any anime in order to enjoy it for what it is but again its a harem so your not really gonna get it caters to those types of fans the ecchi and harem people. For a harem its aight.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- It was quite enjoyable to say the least a lot of the episodes will keep you super tuned in and wondering is there gonna be a final enemy and what not the story is honestly what will make you enjoy it and the music in the fighting scenes if it didn't have those it would be kinda average but it is a good anime.\\n\\n\r\noverall- 8/10 just something good to watch not crazy good but just a good anime it also has a second season so you should watch that as well if you enjoy watching the first season.",

            "content": "First a short introduction .I have been watching anime for three and a half years now. I first began watching Naruto with my brother which he got from his friend. After binge watching Naruto in three weeks I began to crave more anime and thus my brother's good friend introduced me to the wide world of anime.\r\nI took 3 anime after Naruto namely Z/X ignition ,Highschool DXD and Freezing including the second season Freezing Vibration. Once again I am a binge watcher ,if I like an anime i will watch it until it is finished.\r\nAs most of you know Highschool DXD and Freezing are bothecchi anime. A lot of people dislike ecchi and harem anime but I really like these genres.\\n\\n\r\nFirst I will get the obvious out of the way. Yes there is a lot of fan service and perverted scenes including during the fights and yes this is what made me interested in the anime at first but after finishing the first three episodes I began watching it for different reasons.\\n\\n\r\nI mainly enjoyed the anime because of the main female character Satellizer. After being introduced I instantly realized that something must have happened in her past to make her react the way she did to people. She distend herself from everyone and she was feared by everyone but i just couldn't understand why. After later finding out more about her past I just felt sad for Satellizer and finally understood why she distend herself from everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song 'COLOR' by maria was just damn amazing for me. I did not once skip that song. It is a pretty relaxing song and matched perfectly with the opening scene. After watching a lot more anime i realized that there was nothing that special about the art style in Freezing but I still just love how it looked when they used their powers. \\n\\n\r\nFreezing just put a smile on my face after watching each episode and left a huge gaping hole inside of me after binge watching it in a day. The story was good enough to keep me interested after each episode but the mystery of Satellizer's past was what kept me really interested. Her story is made more clear after each episode. The romance plot between her and Kazuya was very enjoyable as well.\\n\\n\r\nI like anime with a touch of gore and violence and Freezing quenched my thirst for this. Fighting scenes had nudity in with a touch of blood and decapitation of limbs here and there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Freezing was initially one of the anime that made me love anime more and more and will always remain one of my favourite anime of all time.",

Don't get me wrong the first four or five episodes were pretty rough to get through but after that its pretty decent. The trick to enjoying this anime is to know exactly what you are getting which is 98% fan service. There is a little bit of good story in show depending on your own personal opinion, but that is not the focus point. So if you go in knowing that whatthis anime is going to give you is a face full of fan service then i think you will enjoy it, otherwise it might not be your cup of tea.",

            "content": "tl;dr: Absolutely cringe-worthy for the first 4 episodes, show gets considerable better from there. Season 2 (Freezing Vibration) puts it to shame.\r\nThis show really does start off awkward. The sheer amount of exposition in Episode 1 is staggering. The delivery is typical teacher giving a lesson, but it's less natural than others shows have done. Within the first four episodes and the majority of the first, there's a moment of supreme social embarrassment every 5 minutes. I have never seen a show that makes me cringe so much as this one has. If all you want is Ecchi, I feel like DXD or HotD wouldbe better choices. They have better action, Ecchi that isn't as much in your face \"Here it is! The Ecchi!\", and fewer moments that make you feel insufferable embarrassment for the MC. And if you like good action, those others are a far better choice as the action is much more varied.\\n\\n\r\nAside from episodes 1-4 being near-insufferable, ep 5 was actually really good. By episode 7, the show takes off and gets progressively better, though it sticks tightly to cliches and plot conveniences. The MCs wear thick plot armor in this show. I'd rate the last eight episodes at around a 7, and the first four at a 2 or 3.\\n\\n\r\nI gave season 2, Freezing Vibration, an 8. I'm not very big on Ecchi, but I gave DXD and HotD both a 7, in comparison. One could even watch season 2 straight off, skipping S1 for later, so let that factor into your decision here.",

            "content": "I'm just going to say, off the top of my head, I haven't read many reviews of Freezing which give it the credit I think it deserves. So that's why I'm writing this.\r\nStory - 9 \r\nWhilst watching a lot of anime what you have to bear in mind is that there is usually some sort of material that it is being adapted from. Freezing, the anime, has only part of a story. And that part is awesome. The story has many parts to it that will intrigue you, if you're the sort of person who likes to know everything there is to know about whatyou're watching. Throughout there  are undertones that something else is going on behind the scenes and if you pick up on it it makes for a headscratcher. The actual plot is more or less stubborn guy meets strong but fragile girl and his relationship with her in a world where everybody seems to be out to get them for one reason or another. But, like I said, it has a very nice and mysterious undercurrent to it. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nYes, I enjoyed the art of Freezing, sue me for liking bouncing boobs. Two aspects of the art I particularly enjoyed were the NOVA and the 'evil' looks of Satellizer. Both were pretty impressive.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nIt's rare I enjoy a soundtrack so much. The intro is one I'll actually sit there and listen to and the battle between East and the NOVA....... wow the soundtrack gave me chills. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\r\nThe characters were kind of... meh ranging from a guy with some obvious unresolved issues with his sister, a girl who hates to be touched to the point where people dont even like getting close enough to talk to her and someone rather worryingly nicknamed 'Intoxicating Bondage.' Of the main cast, only Chiffon Fairchild is truly memorable and that, for me, is purely because her eyes are actually shut and not just drawn that way. How she goes through the whole series without opening her eyes is beyond me. For almost solely that reason I'm saying 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9  \\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed this, so much so, it's one anime I actually bought. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nBlood, boobs, a school where older girls are required to 'please' their juniors, intrigue, mystery, some kickass fighting sequences, the occasional comedic moment and some nice character development I didn't mention above. I don't see what's not to like. Freezing definitely has a little something for everyone.",

This anime is overall good and I think it was well rounded and defined things pretty well.\r\nThis anime has ecchiness to it. It is not censored (PARTY!), and for those who do not know, I am a firm believer on not censoring things. But this is not why the anime is good. It definatally adds value though. Some of the ecchiness I believe is just like, really, they would do that (trying to not give away anything too significant, sorry), I was completely thinking they were going to do that. It happens multiple times during the fights soyou will know if you watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis is mainly an action anime. Many fights, many battles, but obviously they are going to hold big events to the end as usual for any type of anime or movie at that. But there is at least I believe 3 battles during each episode which makes the anime worth watching. The battles are pretty cool with all the different types of stuff that they have and it fits well with the plot of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a fantasy since they are fighting these alien things and they are using weapons that they otherwise would not have. It  is very entertaining (being serious).\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is really good which is why I have given it a 10 and has been added to my all time favorite list. The plot is well defined and it gives enough of a back story for us to understand what is going on throughout the anime. I love the action, love the battles, love the ecchiness. I would recommend this to anyone who likes action and fantasy animes. If you do not like action or fantasy, then I would still recommend this to you if you would like to try something new out. Easy to follow story and very entertaining. Until Next Time!",

To help them they must chose a Limiter who is a younger boy who can freeze the Nova and slow it down so the Pandora can kill it. To seal the deal the Pandora and Limiter must lose theirvaginity together.\\n\\n\r\nThe Pandora's are rubbish at this probably because the Nova don't have large breasts to expose which is probably why the get killed when they fight one.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway the story follows Kazuya Aoi who tries to get the bad girl at school, Satellizer Bridget, to let him be her Limiter. Satellizer surprise surprise has the largest breasts, is the best Pandora and is really shy and venerable. Kazuya is surprise surprise is the wimp with a good heart whose last memory of his sister (a dead Pandora) is her naked. Yep it really is that cliched.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong I'm not anti ecchi or prudish but there is better ecchi and less cliched ecchi like High School of the Dead, Bludgeong Angel Dokuru Chan and Kanokan which at  least offer something other than large bouncing breasts",

For example, it has lots of fast-paced battle scenes (good), but because it shows fights all the time it leaves very little room for character development (not so good).\r\nFurther, the fighting does not need to take so much screen time. This show pauses in way too many places for expository dialogue. For every few seconds of a fight, the action will stop for a moment so a couple of lines of dialogue can tell you exactly what you're seeing. It's kind of stupid, since half thetime you'll be thinking \"what show do you think I've been watching up to now?\" Maybe they figure people who watch anime at whatever early hour of the morning this originally aired are too tired or stoned to pay much attention, if they've been watching at all, or maybe they figure it adds more screen time for nudity.

This anime will provide you with blood, nudity, fanservice, gore but no matter what it will leave you wanting more.\r\nThe story is pretty good I'd say. Set in the not so distant future (2050 actually), Earth is invaded by aliens from another dimension called Nova. The common military's attempts to fight back are futile and so, the Pandora program is born. Women are implanted with stigmata that further enhance their combat skills while certain males that are implanted with stigmata as well gain the abilityto cast Freezing, an energy field that renders Nova movement impossible. The story's main axis focuses on the complicated relationship between Aoi Kazuya, a Limiter and Satellizer L. Bridget, a Pandora in a world that prepares itself for battle. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely great. Each character has his own, unique set of battle moves and the fanservice is depicted beautifully (keep a tissue box next to you jsut in case). Freezing is not hesitating to reveal beautifully shaped cleavages while the next time blood is spilled during combat. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, Bridgette has a rich personality. On the outside she is The Untouchable Queen, a mighty Pandora that rarely loses, merciless, relentless, cold and distant. But on the inside, she's a woman with a troubled and abusive past that simple seeks compassion and, most possibly, love. The rest of the characters are unique, each with his own personality and past that is explained nicely. Personally, my favourite character is Rana Linchen. I just love that merry-go-happy style combined with an awesome body and a cute face.\\n\\n\r\nThe soudntrack starts enjoyably and nicely, but as the story progresses it becomes kinda dull and repetitive. The sounds effects however are spot on. The sounds of steel clashing with steel, the explosions, the creepy Nova voice, the sound of flesh as it gets torn apart add depth and realism to every battle or scene.\\n\\n\r\nYou will definitely enjoy this one. Freezing does what it's supposed to do: hot babes with medieval-styled weapons (and not only) clash in a futuristic world ready to be ravaged by war. The fanservice is overflowing and I myself had to gather my mind (and my jaw since it dropped on the floor). \\n\\n\r\nA small advice: keep some blood units around. Just in case your life is in danger from the many nosebleeds. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

The sound is nothing special.  The lead female seems to be switching personas on a frequent basis.\r\nOverall, I'd say it's not that great.  It sets you up with anticipation rather than excitation.\r\nTons of in-your-face fan service and the animation of it is weird compared to other anime.Is it weird to criticize an anime for the way it draws boobs?  Maybe.",

All the other side characters also carried no depth, or originality, which meant that they really couldn't carry the story along. \r\nIf you want to see bunch of girls with big boobs fighting for no reason, then this is the show for you.

            "content": "If you're able to set aside the nudity and fan service and just watch it for the plot, then this anime is really good. \r\nFreezing is a good sci-fi action anime that has a plot that makes you want to know more after watching each episode. They use a lot of technical terms in it as well related to human biology and the brain since the anime is very science oriented. However this new science allows humans to have powers that are a double edged sword, since too much of this power can cause a human to turn into an alien like creature (aka nova).The main protagonist is a girl named Satellizer, and she is very anti-social due to her past experiences. However, she is one of the strongest pandora and she is a very strong female character in terms of personality. What really drew me in to this anime was that the women are the ones who are the protectors of the human race while younger men are chosen as the supporting characters but have lesser powers. I was looking for a show that had strong female protagonists instead of male and this definitely fits that description. The show ends on a good note, but does have a season two that has even more drama and explanations to several questions. If you read the manga later on, the manga has a lot more plot and action to it and is way ahead than both seasons. The OST for this anime is really good too, it matches the fighting scenes and the sad scenes. Some songs that stood out to me was Sentou (piano version) and the original Sentou, which is the main theme of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint about this anime was that there was too much nudity for scenes that didn't really make sense. Everyone seems to skinny dip in pools and for some reason their clothes don't regenerate when fighting and leave body parts exposed even though they have the ability to regenerate asap. There was too much fan service for my liking and honestly this show would have still done just as good without it because of the story and all the action.",

Interesting enough i started wacthing Freezing right after a \"more intellectually pleasing\" anime (Seikai no Monsho)... because once in a while i need something plain fun. And Freezing totally delivered.\r\nFreezing is your typical ecchi harem anime with Sci Fi elements to it. I won`t write anything about the story because you could as well read the summary on MAL, so i get right to the point: I really liked the school setting in S1 as it established the characters and their conflicts very well. But be prepared to seeyour typical fight of the week between characters structure in this show (at least in S1). The main plot about the Novas isn`t really big part of S1 (and even S2 (Vibration) only slightly touches it). Many people complain about the shift from the relationship between Kazuya and Satelliser in S1 to the relationships between all the pandoras in S2, but i really felt that S2 (Vibration) profited from it and is the better season. All in all S2 is much stronger in exploring the backgrounds of the characters (especially Satelliser) and a very faithfull adaptation of the manga.\\n\r\nThough i have to say the overall tone of the manga is somehow darker.\\n\\n\r\nAnimationwise Freezing and Freezing Vibration are great The fights are always a joy to watch, especially when it comes to the creativity of the animators on how to \"undress\" the pandoras during the fights.^^\\n\\n\r\nConclusion and note about the manga: Freezing is a very faithfull adaptation of the manga. Both seasons are a pleasure to watch even though the story isn`t anything to complex/intellectual or let me say quite silly at times. The reason why i write this review though is the fact that S2 doesn`t end on a cliffhanger that forces you to read the manga. The ending is a very well done conlusion to the show with a climactic finale. Even though you don`t get to know the origins of the Nova in the anime at least it gives you a feeling of closure and that is very uncommon when it comes to incomplete manga adaptations.\\n\\n\r\n*** For anyone who wants to continue with the manga after the show. The 2nd Season (Vibration) ends basically in Ch 91 of the manga, so you could contiue with Ch 92 of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nS1 + S2 (Vibration):\\n\\n\r\nStory 7.7/10\\n\r\nCharacters 7.7/10\\n\r\nArt/Animation 8/10\\n\r\nMusic 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict 7.9/10\\n",

            "content": "Okay, let me begin by stating that I am certainly no prude when it comes to the ecchi genre. As a heterosexual male I consider it to be a certain guilty pleasure I like to indulge in fairly frequently.\r\nHowever, I've often found that anime in the genre are something to go into with low expectations as more often than not the fanservice basically takes priority over the actual plot. That being said there are ecchi anime that do at least make the effort to tell a good story such as the brilliant and hilarious Kill la Kill, Ikki Tousen Dragon Destiny, my personal favorite seasonin the Ikki Tousen series, and even Queen's Blade while some have the potential to tell a good story but just throws in so much fanservice that it distracts from the story such as Senran Kagura.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to Freezing. And when it comes to low expectations, by God did I have them for this series. I remember reading a review in a magazine once that gave it a negative review with a one star rating out of five. Nonetheless I went into the show and decided to see it for myself.\\n\r\nAnd I ended up coming out of it feeling unfulfilled.\\n\\n\r\nTo cut a long story short, the series is set in the far future where giant aliens called NOVA threaten humankind. The only way to fight the threat is by sending in female soldiers called Pandora whom are trained by a school/training facility named Genetics and are backed by male partners called Limiters who cast an ability called Freezing to trap the aliens and supply power to their Pandora partners while they handle the fighting.\\n\\n\r\nAt least that's what the series is suppose to be about. Instead we get another school fighting anime where many of the female characters are absolutely hateful, big breasted brats who's sole intention is to bully and kick each others arses rather than focus on dealing with the alien threat because there so caught up in fighting each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the male characters? HA! Talk about a joke! They practically do nothing but hide behind their Pandora partners while casting their Freezing spells and empowering them. Other than that they do practically nothing and might as well not even be there.\\n\\n\r\nNow your probably wondering where the whole \"alien monsters bent on destroying humanity\" plot point come in to this. Well, sadly it doesn't. Oh it's brought up in the first episode and a few other times in the series but it never comes into the story until the final three episodes.\\n\r\nAnd it's unfortunate because this is where the series had potential! Instead we get an other Ikki Tousen clone (so to speak) with plently of clothes shredding fight scenes of women hating each other for one reason or another with male characters that might as well be redundant.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so I should probably move on to what was actually good about the series.\\n\r\nWell, the animation and art are fantastic, the fight scenes are certainly entertaining and the music is decent.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Freezing is a well animated series that had the potential to be a pretty decent series but ultimately falls flat due to bad story telling and bland characters. But somehow I can't bring myself to call it terrible, more like something that needed more work. A lot more work.",

Just a small taste of this show and you will be begging for more, you will literally kill your own father for no reason. This show is electric terrorism, caged silence, unfiltered truth. All you need to know about the story is that there is some dope ass bitches with crazy abilities and they beat the shit out of each other. There is more to it than that, like there is a reason they have the powers in the first place, the world is post apocalyptic and theyhave to kill these creatures, but that doesn't even matter because the show is short, they barely fight them because most of the characters just wanna kick the living shit out of each other, and if you like it you will actually just read the manhwa since this is just 12 episodes and some short OVA garbage. The characters are somewhat interesting and I definitely do wanna see them fleshed out more and see what happens to them. The fanservice, which isn't even fanservice because their tits are literally a focal point of the show because they are always out, is usually pretty funny because they try to put it in even during really serious moments. This isn't a show for faggots that complain about how 2D pussy is killing anime and how we should all pay for a shitty streaming service. If you don't want your dick being constantly hard while still being entertained by a plot, don't watch this. The music is pretty good, the opening is a really badass cover of a miku song. Overall it's entertaining and I feel like it has a good balance between tits and fighting, I mean, it isn't like queen's blade or something where that is literally it, you can get invested in the plot even if their tops get torn off 5 seconds into every fight, it's worth checking out.",

            "content": "I will NOT stand for this! All these negative reviews, and not one justifying fact to them! Lets start from the beginning. I just finished Highschool DxD (Another great BTW) and was paging through my book marks. I see so many interesting animes and have friends recommending them to me that normally I just bookmark the anime for a later time. I actually found freezing by accident, a mis-click. Now, I read the synopsis and thought it would be interesting. So I started the first episode. *Sigh* why did I open Pandora's Box? This anime was written SO well that it actually felt...I can't evengrasp how it made me feel. Later on, it made me feel sad and ripped my soul to shreds like the uniforms in this show, but moving on. Now, yes I'm a guy, this has what you'd call a lot of \"Battle Porn\" or clothing destruction. But that is what hentai is for so I just rolled with it. Come on! Swords, whips, quarter staffs, your going to lose some clothing! It's realistic (And hot but that's my perv side talking). But if you look deep into the anime and start peeling through the layers (No pun intended), there is a deep anime here. One that has such an emotional tie to it that you will feel it (I sobbed, OKAY! You happy?! The 265lb football player grew a heart for this anime). The story I can't talk about due to the annoying bullets on the right hand side of my screen. But you'll feel it all fold together. \\n\r\n     The characters, on the other hand, is what I fell in love with. But, that was Pandora's Box. The Trojan Horse. The Trap!. I felt so much for these characters that it was like I knew them. Befriended them. Loved them. Hated them. Despised them! So when the back stories came to light, that's what buckled me over. I've only had one other anime do that to me and that was Angle Beats. But unlike waiting for the last episode to rip your guts out, this one dose it right off the bat. The first episode makes that clear. Seeing the things they went through, you just lose all heart. These high school students have been through so much in their lives that your surprised most have yet to kill them selves. And that is a big morale. With all the crap that they went through, all the pain and shame, they Survived! And found strength in their past. It's inspiring.                                                                                                                                                 The art is well done. Not the best I've seen but far from the worst. The animators were not shy to show decapitation. And the sound all matches the weapons. I'm a weapon nut and these weapons sound great. Since that is what you hear most of the time, that's a good thing. To top it, the voice acting is good and crisp. These people knew who to play. The brat had a good stuck up tone to her while the main Pandora had that \"Steel on bones and Ice water in veins\" sound to her.                                                                                                                                                         If this anime wasn't so hard to watch (Personal stuff), I would watch it about 5-8 more times before I left it for a while. It set a whole new bar for my expectations for character and story progression. So yeah, I enjoyed the living Pi$$ out of it! I'm fixing to watch it again after I'm done with my current anime.",

No matter what other people rate this anime as low rank, it is impossible to give this anime any less than the score it deserves, so I will give this story a rank of masterpiece 10 out of 10. Keep reading the chapters if you don't understand what I am talking about. after volume 9, it gets really exciting.",

            "content": "I started reading Freezing as a manga and really enjoyed it. The story was pretty decent and the characters were nice. Now i admit i do read/watch ecchi for the girls, at least in part. However i personally am the kinda guy who doesn't appreciate nudity like at all (just ruins it to me), so the topless scenes were something i could've gone without. that aside tho this anime had some of the cutest girls i've seen in anime, especially Bridget. I loved her rough outer atmosphere but with the gentle, vulnerable girl underneath. Although the anime seemed to show that side a bit toooften and took a bit away from the rarity of it...but it was ok. I very much enjoyed the true love aspect of the story as well with Kazuya and Bridget. Now the fighting, i must say some of the most intense relentless fighting scenes i have ever seen! The maker also did a great job with keeping u informed with the terms and names of abilities. However, now comes my biggest complaint to the anime: it doesn't stay as true to the manga as i would like. Sure some things were a bit smaller like cutting out the flashback with Ingrid and the change in how Kazuya met Rana. However there where other bigger changes that i think they should have not changed such as Pandora mode which instead of being this Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep awesome armor was just a thing with glowing lights (although it did still look cool don't get me wrong, its just i think the armor was more appropriate). THE BIGGEST problem was the ending.....the PREMATURE ENDING!!! I don't know whats up with anime creators nowadays but there's been a growing trend of creating anime from smaller, kinda third party manga and ending them prematurely by cramming everything from the end of the series into the last couple episodes or making up an entirely new ending. Freezing, Claymore, High School of the Dead (although i have not read the manga for that so i don't know if they really screwed it up that badly), all of them were ended at earlier times then they should have! In Freezing in particular they sped up the threat of the Novas and referenced a major character and plot that hasn't even been seen in the manga yet! I guess I'm getting too angry, its just i hate seeing anime that have a lot of potential being ended so early before they even have time to bloom into something great! Overall though, Freezing is an amazing series that has great characters, intense fights, hot girls (although a bit of nudity), and great pure love with the main characters. I do recommend this anime however i strongly argue to read the manga as well, since it keeps going and does a little better of a job.",

            "content": "Aside from the story, characters, amount of fan service, the logic and atmosphere it creates, the horrible feeling and the awful aftertaste, this anime could be quite decent...... Is what I would like to say as a joke, but I don't even want to give it that much credit, and I'll explain some stuff about this anime below...\r\nDon't pay attention to the current anime summary, I got a better one.\r\n\"A retarded hero with some random superpower is placed in a mental institution where people are brainwashed by stories of mystical aliens that never show up just to bring out fear in these prisoners. In thisinstirution you are ranked by your pride and ego levels, everyone fights hard to rise in rank and prove that they're as crazy as they get. This hero finds a girl with some childhood traumas and dead parents, and so he decides to help her (no one asked for it). By trying to help this poor girl, the blood thirsty prisoners find a great chance to rise in rank as if there was a bounty on their heads, therefore putting everyone into even more trouble as it is...\"\\n\\n\r\nYou know when you rarely find an anime that has one scene where there is someone in the anime you just want to kill or torture if that was possible? well, if you like that kind of stuff, look no further!!! Every single character introduced in this anime (except a few main leads) have such personalities that wouldn't even exist in the world we live in, everyone is a crazy self-righteous, self-centred egomaniac with over-exaggerated pride who cant stand someone better than themselves and who want to \"teach a lesson\" to those who \"think they're better\" (as in - kill those who might be a threat to their pride)\\n\r\nAnyway, to encounter an anime with such a scene that doesn't last too long once in a while is fine I guess, but here, in this peace of crap anime, these characters are swarming in every corner, and they just can't not interfere with someone else's business, when one of them (or a group) is dealt with, you don't even have the time to relax, when another group just comes swarming in. This whole anime is composed from just that and nothing else, so in the end, after finding a box on the road with the tag \"Freezing\", after bringing it home with me and having some hope and excitement about it, I opened it, and found nothing but manure inside.\\n\r\nSaying \"don't waste your time watching it\" probably won't change anything since curiosity is in human nature, but just be prepared before starting it (and don't expect much from it).\\n\\n\r\nAlso the uniforms in the institution are somewhat interesting as they only rip around the breasts... (action - punched in the face; result - clothing (including the bra) flies off the breast area)\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this was my first review ever and English is not my native language, so I couldn't convey my full feelings about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime as much as I would enjoy getting needles pushed up my nails.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review, and since you're going to watch the anime now, ENJOY :D",

There isn't a single moment boobs are present without being accompanied by action or emotional character thought/development. Therefore, no sacrifices are made to squeeze in fanservice like other series tend to do. That aside, the story here is a really solid one. The problem is the students spend a ton of time fighting amongst themselves rather than directing their power to the true enemy. Because of this I found myself feeling like I couldn't really root for the \"good guys\" due to them all beingincredibly ignorant assholes. But they aren't just assholes. They are really savage about it and fuck each other up pretty bad. This really made the story suffer. \\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't for the storyline flaw, this anime would be supreme. The art and lighting is incredible. They do a great job at creating a realistic atmosphere to pull you into their situations. The battles are extremely intense and brutal. The emotional experiences are much stronger than most series as well. You'll find yourself tearing up a lot. There is a good variety of characters, but some go underdeveloped so you don't appreciate them as much. All in all, Freezing is an excellent anime.",

            "content": "Just another \"ecchi highschool main male dense protagonist in a school filled with girls?\"...THINK AGAIN!!!\r\nNo, by all seriousness Freezing isn't suppose to be taken as a cliche storm of the genre this anime is in, if anything it is taken as a \"darker and edgier\" vers. of it's genre and execute it well.\r\nFreezing however only at first has a cliche premise from the start and a boatload of exposition to get us enveloped in Freezing's world, what with the main male protagonist getting admitted to West Genetics military academy and getting to know the school as well as the more renowned students. We are alsoshown the \"entities that are wiping humanity\" as Nova's (some angel-like deity that are feared for), on top of that, the school, West Genetics have something of a student hierarchy where the Third Years tries to keep a leash on the lower years as well as the nature of the male students being essentially support students to the Pandora battle-ready female fighters. If anything besides the the premise itself, not only does the world building of Freezing break the mold from the genre this anime is in, but the hierarchy of the school as well as the solid dark and edgier tone makes this anime an outlier and rather unique. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, Aoi Kazuya voiced by Mitsuhiro Ichiki our main male protagonist isn't a dense idiot all throughout the anime and he actually makes proper and smart decisions, to be precise he isn't cliche like most typical main male protagonist as it is the genre cliches that make him \"cliche\", he has a personality and a goal people. Satellizer el Bridget is your ace of the Second Years and the best fighter in her year, she is afraid of being touched though it gives her a bit of gap moe (which was even pointed out in the anime itself), she was LA's favorite character and Rana Linchen voiced by Kana Hanazawa a transfer Tiebtan student who completes the love triangle to Satellizer and Kazuya and often butt heads with Satelllizer, although Rana isn't LA's favourite character in the anime, but she DOES have some of the best and funniest lines in the anime. Many of the other students such as Ganessa Roland voiced by Eri Kitamura a fighting rival of Satellizer to Attia Simmons voiced by Kana Ueda a third year who pulls the strings to get the third years to go after Satellizer and Rana were some characters of interest, LA's favourite minor character actually goes to the student council president Chiffon Fairchild voiced by Marina Inoue because well of Marina Inoue's moe voice (but her being something of a mysterious badass by the end of this season's anime). Kazuya and especially Satellizer along with her backstory gets the most character development within this anime. Kazuya's development if anything is development through his relationship with Satellizer as well as him as our audience surrogate getting to know the world of Freezing. Rana however gets shafted for harem hijinks with hardly any character development besides being a love interest for Kazuya.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the world of Freezing, there are two major focuses, the political hierarchy of West Genetics school where the third years or just rivals of Satellizer battle each other in which the battles themselves are extremely brutalized, sure clothes rip like \"Ikkitousen\" but blood gets spilled and body parts gets cut open like playdough.\\n\\n\r\nOn speaking of the battles and clothes ripping, the fanservice for Freezing at best goes to uncensored breasts, full nudity and panty and chest shots nearly every episode, but doesn't go anything further from that (though the is used for typical ecchi romance cliches) and guess what LA didn't care about the excessive fanservice, because although the camera likes to leer at the girls butts or breasts, the fanservice isn't the sole focus of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBack onto the other major focus of the anime, the \"Nova's\" (the entities trying to wipe humanity out) and the Pandora's fighting them, the Nova themselves are really something to be feared by and no just \"some monsters to fight and defeat\" as they are actually quite smart monsters and just shows why the Pandora's and the Limiters (the male students) were made to fight them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by A.C.G.T by all means have some very good quality animation throughout, from the distinct character designs to the battle scenes to heck even the backgrounding. Though throughout the anime it has drab dark tones throughout signifying the world that they live in though LA would wanted to see more of color palette other than light black or dull blue for the backgrounding. It's in stark contrast to the character designs with the many differing hair colored main cast of characters and militaristic student uniforms (red and white) for females and typical school uniforms for males (yellow and blue). A.C.G.T overall did a good job in the animation department.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting-wise, well LA said this in the character section, but since Rana Linchen had some fo the bets lines in the series, Kana Hanazawa was LA's favorite voice actor in this anime, though Mamiko Noto as Satellizer was a close second, though Freezing's voice cast is AMAZING from Sayaka Ohara, Rie Kugimiya, Akeno Watanabe, Rumi Ookubo, Ai Kayano, Izumi Kitta, Ami Koshimizu, Asami Sanada, Miki Ito, to again the aforementioned Kana Hanazawa and Mamiko Noto, this voice cast is AMAZING, LA had to point that out twice...\\n\\n\r\nThe ending went into a climactic arc and solely focuses on a huge Nova raid and further gave Satellizer and Kazuya major development (Satellizer defrosting to her comrades and Kazuya to Satellizer's relationship moving further) and really there were lots of risks within this ending HOWEVER by the end of the ending's ordeal, the risks (*cough* deaths) were just wrapped up and \"the risks weren't really risks\" which was a shame as it would have solidified the \"darker and edgier\" tone for Freezing.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were anything else LA would complain about Freezing would be it's pacing issue around the middle of the anime where it pretty much goes into \"Third Year fight\" of the week kind of scenario or just filler episodes here and there and yes, we do get relationship building as well as seeing more of hierarchy of the school, LA would wanted to mix this and the Nova fighting up from time to time (though LA could see why they put the Nova fighting near the end of the anime giving us a looming and deadly threat and why the Nova should be feared in the first place), as for the filler episode's defense LA would say it was to cool down before getting into the more serious plotlines, nonetheless as LA put some defenses to these complaints, the complaints LA put out are minor. The only major complaint however is that due to the huge cast of characters, the majority of characters (besides Satellizer, Kazuya, Rana and the Third Year Elites) get little screentime and are either spectators or one-off rivals who become comical after Satellizer's fight with them thus their little screentime for the minor characters is a bit of a problem. \\n\\n\r\nHowever with all the praising and faults Freezing has, by all means is a good anime, excessive fanservice or not, from it's great world building to it's hierarchical nature of the school to the brutalized battles to it's darker and edgier tone which due to the anime being executed very well, the \"darker and edgier\" statement is justified and not just a statement to overstate this anime.",

            "content": "Freezing, an anime that has nothing to do with cold or winter. As there are a lot of other reviews for this anime I am going to write a short review with some little points that are not included in other ones.\r\n-First of all Freezing hasn't got any content that could qualify as \"Harem, martial arts, or sci-fi\", so for the ones that are tempted to watch it looking for that kind of content will feel disappointed (I point this out because it is categorized with those genres). This is a romance anime with poor interaction or development with the ones involved (Main + MainHeroine 1 + Main Heroine 2) and with absolutely one sided attraction from one of the main heroines. About the martial arts, this anime has none. Only two characters fight bare handed and it is just that. And about sci-fi, the only thing that comes to my mind that could be sci-fi is the technology used for making the \"Pandoras\" (why don't call the anime that way, it has more sense) and some computers they use; and they don't speak of that too much.\\n\\n\r\n-Second, this anime is indeed over dramatic. For and ecchi-action series this has tons of childish drama. And everything goes around the fame and prestige of the students in this school and who beats who and to respect the senpais... They put more focus on the competitions between students than to fight the eva-like creatures that attack the planet\\n\\n\r\n-Third, the only relation between the title of the anime (Freezing) and its content is that the male students only ability (Yes the only reason for males to exist in this school is to use one ability that at some point is useless) is called \"Freezing\". Also there is a very annoying fact about this, all what males do here is to follow around this rich ladies as they were dogs; and when they use their only power somehow it is easily countered by almost anyone.\\n\\n\r\n-Fourth and last, as much as I dislike overpowered characters I found quite annoying the way they changed the main heroine in the last episodes (and got worse in the second season). I don't want to spoil the background of this character, but to summarize it she has been harmed in a way that made develop a phobia to be touched; this bound together with the fact that she is kinda overpowered presented her as an untouchable character. The problem is they change her too much, to the point that in the second season she is has almost the opposite personality\\n\\n\r\nStory 5 + Art 6 + Sound 6 + Character 5 + Enjoyment 6 = aprox 6\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: This is a regular quality battle-ecchi-seinen anime. You will not find harem or romance or martial arts, and you will find almost nonexistent comedy or character development. Watch it if you have nothing better to watch, I would recommend \"Ranma 1/2\" for romance-martial arts or \"Mahou sensei negima\" for action-ecchi (not to much action but is better made)",

            "content": "TIP: Whenever I say PLOT, I'm talking about ASS & BREAST(aka fan service)\r\n  Freezing, a story of a world that's at war with enemies known as the NOVA, Huge & powerful as they be humanity refuses to kneel to such a threat. Militaries around the world came up with a plan to fight back against the NOVA. The Military in each country has an acadamy for men & women who attend the acadamy to hoan thier skills & become stronger to fight against the NOVA. The women who attend this school are known a Pandoras, a rare  being capable of skills to bringa NOVA to its knees to protect humanity. Though Pandoras are powerful, they would be nothing without the aid of their Limiters. The NOVAs are capable to cast a field to FREEZE their attackers in place & also making them supceptible to an attack from the NOVA itself. To counter this, the Pandoras have male partners known as Limiters, the abilites of a Limiter is the same as a NOVA, they are able to cast a field freezing anything in its range. But this ability is normally used to counter a NOVAs freezing to give the Pandora a chance to strike at the NOVA.\\n\\n\r\nYes, this anime is a ecchie & a harem, but the PLOT only seems to revolve around a single male. Normally, that's what a harem is, but in this anime the girls who want to become more then friends are 2 girls with occasional attention from other girls around the school. I'll get into detail in my breakdown review. At any rate this show is anything but bad, it's a interesting & enjoyable watch to those who are ecchie & harem fans. If you can't take nip slips & there I advise not to watch it. But to those who want that & believe me I know what you want or you wouldn't of clicked on this anime to begin with you won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBREAKDOWN REVIEW: Scoring ranging from 1-10, 1 being dredful\\n\\n\\n\r\n[9]STORY: Don't let the over-top action fool you or the PLOT keep you in a trance. They actually has some substance to it, meaning there's actually an interesting point to the story. It kinda resembles an average high school. Students fighting among each other but coming together when they face a hurtle they cant defeat alone.\\n\\n\r\n[8]ART: The art in this anime is very good & an on par with a lot of other popular animes. You'll notice throughout each episode when clothes start become revealing or torn the detail tends to pop a little more making you focus primarily on the PLOT...!\\n\\n\r\n[8]SOUND: Sound becomes highten in intimate situations\\n\\n\r\n[8]CHARACTER: The character I'm going to cover are only 3, because I can't cover all of them.\\n\\n\r\n-Kazuya Aoi- The story seems to revolve around  Kazuya. As special he may be he can't help but be stuck in his older sister's shadow because of her sacrifice many years ago. But through self realization he breaks free from her shadow & becomes his own person.\\n\\n\r\n-Satellizer el Bridget- A powerful Pandora who is known as the \"untouchable Queen\" who does not rely on anybody but herself & rather die then admit defeat to anyone & refuses to have a Limiter. Ironic as it may seem she reluctantly meets Kazyuya. Very mean & resiliant at first to Kazyuya she evenually warms up to him slowly.\\n\\n\r\n-Rana Linchen- A transfer student from a an old world country & who is not aware of certain terms amongst average Pandoras. She only wishes to find her \"destined one\" aka her Limiter. By chance she meets Kazyuya & falls head over heals for him & is convinced that Kazyuya belongs to her NOT Saterllizer, thus forcing Kazyuya into a love triangle.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[9]ENJOYMENT: The show is not a bad watch, with the fan service it actually makes the show even better.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[9]OVERALL: Freezing overall is show worthy of praise for its originality & worth watching if you're really into ecchie & harem with a side of action packed fights.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo those looking for another ecchie & harem I recommend this show you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy =)",

Lately I have been enjoying animes with post apocalyptic themes, and \"Partner battles\" reminds me of elemental galde, except the women rule!\r\nAnyways, I actually enjoyed this anime, there was a LOT of fan service, but understandable given the nature of the show, I would say that what bothered me was that even in the end, I ended up with more questions in regards to the storyline in the end than I did with the beginning.\r\nThe character development is wonderful, anime seems to be coming back to the \"Blond\" phase, and the main male wasn't lack luster,he was VERY interesting, but not in a cliche harem type of way. Any way, I would recommend this anime, it's different and it gets a little dark and....morbid at time but it opens up to a new world and leads into the second season very well.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it does leave a lot of plot holes, if it weren't for the developing manga chapters and future anime seasons I'd have given this anime a 2/10 for that reason alone.",

            "content": "[spoilers]\r\nlike seriously alot of spoilers, this is my unfettered opinion. \r\nI greatly enjoyed the premise of this show. dimensional beings that come into existence randomly and genetically modified humans built to fight them. it was a bit like a standard battle school anime, but the dimensional beings added a level of mystery. The enemy remains essentially faceless, there isnt a classic \"bad guy\" and it makes the Novas more terrifying as a result. The musical sore was pretty good, i really enjoyed the inspiring main battle song and it added an \"omph\" to some of the scenes. \r\nthe Two Main characters were alright as well.Satilizer had FAR more depth than Kazuaha (or however you spell it) and she was a fairly 3 dimensional character. i was frustrated in the beginning how she kept saying no to him, but it was refreshing to see a character stick to their guns for as long as she did until agreeing to be partners. unfortunately that never really happened. the whole \"baptism\" never happened for the two of them and instead we get one of the most forced and shitty harems i have ever seen. which leads me to my main statement. \\n\\n\\n\r\neverything good about the show, i have already mentioned. everything bad is literally the rest of the show. \\n\\n\r\nthe side characters are exhaustively stupid, petty, arrogant, scheming and just amazingly dumb. \\n\\n\r\nyou have the MC's two main friends who are complete cowards, almost every scene with them is \"stay away from satilizer, she crippled a limiter before\" and they NEVER question her motive for doing so. \\n\\n\\n\r\nthe upperclassmen might as well be the fucking novas themselves for how often they try to LITERALLY MURDER THEIR UNDERCLASSMEN. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEVERY. DAM. EPISODE\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\neven in the fucking finale the characters are as worthlessly petty as they have ever been. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEvery time satilizer gets in a fight because some stupid bitch decides that she doesnt like her, the president is like \\n\\n\r\n\"how could you satilizer? what did she ever do to you?\" \\n\\n\\n\r\nthis of course comes after 5 minutes of said classmate beating the shit out of her and the MC\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nspeaking of which the MC is pathetic \"dont hurt her\" all white knighting and everything and when it really matters he is either unconcious or being retarded. he has incredible power but the story rarely touches on that and even when it does he almost never uses it offensively against the novas. he even stops an entire concert hall full of students completely just so he can get satilizer out of it all with barely any effort. but that power is never shown again and instead he gets tossed around like a puppy dog. \\n\\n\\n\r\nspeaking of dogs, Rana, the biggest leg humper of them all, comes in out of nowhere from essentially Tibet and sees the MC and decides that he will be hers. Then, after he straight up tells her no, shes like \"well i wont give up\" and then proceeds to be a boat anchor the rest of the series. like i said before, its the most shitty, pointless, fruitless and worthless rivalry ever. had she not been in the story i am sure my review of this series would have been way way different. \\n\\n\\n\r\ni enjoyed parts of the finale, but it just brought about the same stupid comments and personalities from the rest of the series. these people just fought 4 novas as well as tons of their classmates and nothing changed at all. the upperclassmen are still cunts, the arrogant bitch from the first episode is still the arrogant bitch from the first episode and satilizer and the MC still havnt baptised and made things official and rana is still humping the MC's leg like a sad ugly puppy. \\n\\n\\n\r\nit was a complete let down. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I wanted to enjoy the series because it had an interesting premise, but the plot and themes took a backseat from the fan service that was suffocating. I like and expect a certain amount of fan service, and appreciate it when its done right and has artistic value, but this was just fan service for the sake of! The main character was made only as a sex symbol and then treated like target practice from the other students at this school. The supposed love story is non existent and the guy acts more like alittle kid forced into a sexual situation. I'm also really getting irritated by the out of proportion and the oversized chest of female characters. Granted, there are large breasted women, but not like that! The rest of the bodies are like size 2-6 models with a chest 3-5 times that of a 200lbs woman. I get the point is to attract guys and many of these artists view and find large breasts appealing, but can't you have a little respect for women? Or how about come up with something creative than cheap? \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for fan service watch this, but if you're expecting an interesting and well crafted plot and fleshed out characters keep searching!",

            "content": "Let me begin by saying that this is one of the better ecchi anime I have seen to date. Most aspects of it are above average to say the least. However, there's no denying the fact that the anime could've been much better if it had avoided some frustrating cliches.\r\nThe thing that struck me the most about this anime is how similar the setting is to Neon Genesis Evangelion. Humankind under threat of invasion by otherworldly beings of alien origin, some kind of top-secret technology that allows them to combat the unknown threat and even conspiracies to top it off. It has NGE written allover it thus far. But this is where the similarities end and, cracks begin to appear. To begin with, I do not think an anime with such a serious theme should have had as much ecchiness as Freezing did. This is a minor complaint though and shouldn't affect the experience much if you've decided to pick it up after seeing the 'ecchi' tag as I did. The second and the biggest problem is that the plot veers wildly off course after the introduction. One doesn't witness epic battles for survival. No, the viewer is instead treated to squabbles between the female protagonist (Satellizer) and other random Pandora. Given the backdrop of the series, this is an odd decision on the part of the producers. That said, the plot does manage to recover partially towards the end. It may be too little too late for some, but I personally liked the cliffhanger ending. If only the plot and setting were bolstered by not-so-weak characterization, maybe this anime would've stood out of the crowd. \\n\\n\r\nThe characterization is probably the weakest link in Freezing. In fact, it's downright frustrating. To the extent that you might be inclined to drop the series solely because of it. Let's talk about Satellizer first. She is the only character who receives some semblance of development during the course of the series. This by no means implies that she is tolerable as a character. Satellizer is irritating, period. She comes across as a tsundere of the highest order at the beginning (first few minutes of the first episode). Now, that impression is destroyed as soon as it is created by none other than Aoi Kazuya, the male protagonist. He has a sudden urge to hug her because she resembles his late sister, a legendary Pandora. This effectively sends Satellizer's reputation as the 'Untouchable Queen' down the drain. Thereafter, she transforms into this cute, shy insecure high school girl whenever she comes into contact with Kazuya. This, frankly speaking, is downright pathetic and a pain to watch even after the flashback to her distressing past. The chief reason for this is her 'I will not lose' personality. Under normal circumstances, this is supposed to be something admirable. But it's obvious that this is only a facade and she requires Kazuya to bail her out of tough situations. So, what happens when it's all done? You guessed it, she acts all feminine, says something like 'I didn't need your help' and makes a hurried exit from the scene. Satellizer does change during the course of the series though, in fact, she's the only one. But it comes after eleven episodes of utter stupidity. In other words, it doesn't amount to much.\\n\\n\r\nAoi Kazuya is another entity that I would like to discuss in detail. But I'll keep this one brief. Basically, he's your idealistic hero who doesn't take 'no' for an answer and is obsessed with becoming Satellizer's Limiter, probably because of his sister complex. Kazuya's okay for the most part, but it has to be pointed out that his tendency to deliver long, emotional (mostly uninspired) speeches can get irritating. Also, he has some kind of mysterious power which makes his Freezing a lot stronger at the right time. Personally, I'm not a big fan of characters with 'hidden potential' who come through for others in the nick of time and that too, recurrently. Personal views aside, Kazuya doesn't receive any development AT ALL. This is unfortunate as he is one of the leads in this show. The rest of the cast is composed solely of extras. Even Rana Linchen, Satellizer's rival, is just that and doesn't serve any other purpose. But as strange as it may seem, she is actually better than either protagonist in many ways. This is one of those rare anime in which the supporting cast is apparently far better than the protagonists. Don't ask me why though, I have no answer. Overall, this is one of the worst assortment of characters I've seen in any anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are pretty well done for the most and manage to portray action scenes quite nicely. It's nothing revolutionary, but it's more than adequate for an ecchi anime. The same goes for the character designs. They're ok, albeit a tad generic.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio on the other hand is slightly disappointing. The voice cast does a pretty good job, but, none of them really stand out. One gripe I have about with regard to this is that most of what Satellizer says to Kazuya after about five episodes is annoying. Almost every dialogue is delivered in an irritating hesitant tone and has numerous pauses which are quite unnecessary. The soundtack is average, but manages to get the job done.\\n\\n\r\nFreezing isn't a bad anime by any means. In fact, it has an interesting setting and more than adequate back-story for an ecchi anime. But it fails to use that solid foundation to its full potential. Weak characterization and an uninteresting plot prevent it from being one of the best products in it's genre. despite everything I have said, I still think it's a good pick for anyone looking for mindless ecchi action. Freezing has a lot of content to satisfy perverted minds.\\n",

            "content": "Freezing is a sci-fi/action anime with a strong female lead. It falls under the ecchi/harem category and has elements true to this. The story is about a boy named Kazuya Aoi that starts his first day at the East Academy for Pandora. A special group of women born with the ability to draw weapons and have super human powers. The Pandoras are required to find a male partner called limiters that are able to freeze enemies. Kazuya makes friends with one of the odd balls at the Academy named Bridgette L. Satellizer. Also known as the Untouchable Queen.\r\nStory: This Anime has a rather interesting story.Both characters hold a level of power and are against odds that seem possible for their skills. Which doesn't leave you angry or wondering how a character achieves such feats. The story has few fillers and many funny moments. The Atmosphere is that of a drama anime. There isn't alot of Harem/Ecchi going on in it compared to others. Only 2 girls really ever chase after the Protagonist. There is alot of cleavage, but it isn't to the point of ridiculousness.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The Art in this anime is great, perhaps due to it being a newer anime. The environments are great, the fight scenes are detailed, and the character designs are good. The CGI goes well with the Anime and doesn't look out of place.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening for this Anime wasn't one of my favorites, but it was okay. The music in the Anime fits the scenes and adds to the drama feeling of the Anime. Such as when a character is being teamed up on and being beaten. The music starts eerily and leads the view into the emotion the artists want.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in this Anime are my favorite aspect. Kazuya can come off as rash and a bonehead at times, however he doesn't come as a complete idiot like many Animes. Bridgette exhibits the outcast for her power role well and isn't cocky. Over the course of the season she comes out of her and develops well. Other characters follow the development well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: This is one of my favorite Animes. Minus one annoying character it is almost perfect. The aspect of romance and action are just the right amount to keep it interesting and emotional. I recommend this Anime to anyone into Sci-fi/Mecha/or Romance.",
