            "content": "The past couple years haven't been so great for KyoAni. It's hard to deny that they've lost the influence and momentum they had back in the mid-to-late 2000's, and their work as of late has largely ranged from mediocrity to the flat-out bad (yes, I'm looking at Kyoukai no Kanata). Most of these issues can be attributed to their weakness in writing drama, which, thankfully, is nearly non-existent in their most recent series, Amaburi. \r\nAmaburi (officially \"Amagi Brilliant Park\", which doesn't roll off the tongue nearly as well) sticks instead to KyoAni's strengths. While it's lacking in drama and shirtless bishounens, as a light-hearted slice-of-lifeabout a group of idiots managing an amusement park, it's well worth a watch. It also has Isuzu, who is maybe, just maybe, one of the most attractive heroines in anime, if hot anime ladies is your sort of thing. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, anyone potentially interested in the show should be warned that the first episode is by far the worst. In it, the busty heroine (Isuzu) drags the cynical protagonist (Kanie) to the dilapidated amusement park that she manages, in the hopes that the former child actor, who, by the way, has absolutely zero experience in business management, will save the park from ruin. He begrudgingly accepts the offer, of course, and vows to meet the 500,000-visitors-in-four-months deadline so that the park will not be closed. At the end of the episode, Kanie also receives an abrupt kiss and a random superpower (which is not shown or mentioned again until several episodes later), because, uh, reasons?\\n\\n\r\nTell me if this sounds at all familiar, because I've seen hundreds of anime which have started off in the exact same way. I almost dropped Amaburi right there, and I'm glad I didn't, as it quickly shows it has little interest in being a serious story. Instead, it treats alcoholic, talking animals and magical powers as being completely ordinary. There's even a group of pirate walruses and a bloody dragon. Amaburi fully embraces its silly fantasy setting and cares not for realism. \\n\\n\r\nBut a cost of this silliness is that the show spends more time on the animals and park mascots than it does the human characters. And the mascots (who wear their costumes so frequently that they must be fused to their body) are nowhere near as interesting as Kanie or Isuzu, considering that many of them are based on a single trope. There's an otaku masquerading as some sort of squirrel-thing, an easily-angered shark who turns into a hell-demon when doused in water, a sheep who acts like a street thug, and so on and so forth. Sure, these characters add a great deal of energy to the show and make the park feel more alive, but after their second or third appearance, it's not likely you will appreciate their presence all too much. A few of them even show up dozens of times, and by that point it feels like the show is stretching its jokes way too thin. Granted, though, the commercial scene in the final episode is pretty damn hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nMoffle is perhaps the one mascot who is treated as an actual character and not a running gag. He is introduced as some sort of asshole who punches his own customers when they throw a few bad words his way, and really, he's just an unlikeable jerk towards Kanie until the two start to accept each other's existence. But the reason he is a jerk makes sense: he doesn't want ruffians and other undesirables bringing danger to the park's princess, Latifa, so he plays the role of the jerk in order to protect her. It's hard not to warm up to the little guy by the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Latifa, she just sort of... exists. Latifa and the park are the two main focuses of the story, except she's absent in everything that occurs in the park and is only ever relevant in the first and final episodes. She's there solely as a catalyst for drama, which means her scenes are, unsurprisingly, the weakest in the show. At least she stands there and looks pretty sometimes, I guess? \\n\\n\r\nKanie and Isuzu are far more interesting. On the surface, they're both very typical KyoAni characters (the Kyon-like protagonist who sighs and reluctantly does everything, and the big-breasted kuudere prone to hurting things), but there is at least a little bit of depth to their character. Kanie's reasons for quitting his role as a child actor is explained in one short scene, and so too is Isuzu's reason for constantly shooting people with her musket (though why a minor can legally carry a gun to school remains a mystery). The scene where their past is explained is actually handled with a surprising amount of maturity: there's no screaming and crying, no childhood trauma-- the two just accept it and move on with their lives as people normally would. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the fact that the two are high school kids and yet somehow able to run a massive multi-million dollar business on their own is inexcusable nonsense. I'm sorry, but 16-year-olds are nowhere near experienced enough to tackle such a huge responsibility. This is especially evident when Kanie makes asinine decisions like charging only 30yen (equivalent to 30 cents) for park admission, with all the rides being free of charge, as if this wouldn't immediately drive the park to ruin with an insurmountable amount of debt. Isuzu also occasionally shows up wearing an office lady outfit, and I couldn't help but groan every single time. If you want to write adult characters then, please, just bloody write them. It's not like it's particularly difficult to make the characters a few years older-- say, 19 or 20-- rather than forcing them to be high school students when it makes absolutely zero sense in the context of the story. It's like KyoAni is deathly afraid of writing characters past the age of seventeen (perhaps they think their fans will set fire to their studio if they dare try). I'm getting very tired of it. The world does exist outside the confines of high school. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is about what you would expect from any KyoAni anime, which is to say that it looks great. The sound is much more noteworthy as it is what gives the show the majority of its energy. There's a ton of classy jazz music playing in the background, and the OP is the sort of thing that will get stuck in your brain immediately after hearing it for the first time. I spent a few of my college classes with \"MAGIC HEART\" screaming in my head and it was both delightful and horrifying. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to get rid of the feeling that Amaburi is one long prologue to what will probably be a second season. There's subtle hints of romance between Kanie and Isuzu-- the kind that KyoAni loves to expand upon-- and the story abruptly ends with a light-hearted episode that would normally have been stuck in as an OVA. There's a lot of potential for the second season to be superior to the first, and if KyoAni doesn't create one I would be very surprised. And perhaps a little disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAmaburi is best approached with minimal expectations. If you're expecting another big hit from KyoAni, then Amaburi is certainly not going to be that. If you're OK with just having a few laughs at silly nonsense (and if you're a guy, a few erections from Isuzu's scenes), then you'll probably enjoy your time with the show. It's not a great anime, perhaps not even a good one, but there's more than enough enjoyable content in here to warrant a watch. If nothing else, at least it's not Kyoukai no Kanata.",

            "content": "Amagi Brilliant Park has been making waves in the anime community this season, and it's easy to see why. An intriguingly goofy premise coupled with the fact that it's a Kyoto Animation production sets up rather high expectations. And I have to say, Amagi Brilliant Park exceeded my expectations in nearly every way.\r\nTo say that Amaburi is absurd would be an understatement. Kanie Seiya, a high school student, is tasked with reviving a failing amusement park and has three months to reach its yearly quota of 500,000 guests or the park will shut down. Also, this park is inhabited by magical beings from a differentrealm who rely on the fun that visitors have for their livelihood. Add the fact that the two lead characters are named after Kanye West and 50 Cent--how can you resist?\\n\\n\r\nAmaburi does well with its plot, but that's not where its true strength lies. At its core, Amaburi is built on its characters. Absurd, zany, and above all, lovable, the ensemble of characters contained within the park will win you over instantly. I'm amazed at how much character development they managed to fit into 13 episodes (12 really--the last episode is just a filler). Amaburi really makes you feel the characters' emotions and their motivation to keep their park open. It's been a while since I've been this engaged by a show's characters alone. The hilarious trio of mascots, the dysfunctional dance group, Sento's insecurities despite her stoic appearance, and an arrogant, narcissistic, but ultimately big-hearted main character, as well as a plethora of other wild characters leave a lasting impact.\\n\\n\r\nHuge props to the art direction team on this one. Amaburi looks absolutely stunning. The various areas of the park are bright and colorful, the characters are dynamic, and Amaburi features some of the most hysterical facial expressions I've ever seen. A great job is done with character designs (whoever designed Sento, I cannot thank you enough--you have done humanity a great favor). Appearances aren't everything, but in this department Amaburi sure has it all.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I hardly have anything negative to say at all regarding this series. A great job of managing pacing gives it a full, complete feel despite its short length. By the story's conclusion, it's clear that Amagi Brilliant Park is more than just a goofy comedy. It's about more than just a high school kid running a magical theme park. It evokes feelings of community, friendship, and overcoming adversity that, while they may be corny, ring loud and true. Amagi Brilliant Park is far more heartwarming than its premise suggests. This is the feel-good show of the year.\\n\\n",

            "content": "LOOK AT THE SKY IT'S MAGIC HOUR.\r\nActually, it's half an hour in one episode, but you'll get the joke soon.\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is just spectacular. Some of the audience loved it, and I think it's a chance that Kyoto Animation (KyoAni) has actually redeemed themselves over the troubles they had over the past year. Watching the first episode got me hooked since it has an interesting setting to look forward. You surely have seen amusement parks in a lot of anime, but that's just depicting the characters' enjoyment. But, I'm sure you have yet to see behind the scenes of the park's operation.\r\nThe story startswith Sento inviting Kanie to go with her to an unknown location which is Amagi Brilliant Park. Kanie wasn't pleased with the tour from Sento of the amusement park which is bad in shape and unsatisfactory. Later on, Sento introduced Latifa who then wants Kanie to become the next manager of the park and save it from being taken away. Also, this amusement park isn't just any ordinary park. Kanie learnt that it is occupied by 'fairies' from Maple Land, a magical place far from reality.\\n\\n\r\nBefore you are worried about KyoAni's antics, don't worry. To spoil a bit about the story, it wasn't written in a way which later it is plagued with problematic tropes. Basically throughout the whole anime, you see how Kanie is able to handle the park as the manager. He gets to learn more about the park, its attractions and the workers along the way and from there, he finds ways to improve the well-being. The anime is mostly comedic, meaning lots of moments to laugh at from episode to episode. I would say that it wasn't repetitive, making those moments unique in a sense. There are some dramatic moments which honestly, I feel that they are a bit forced and out of place from the prominent hilarious comedy. But not to fret, they don't really mess up the story much, since then the characters involved got back to their feet. There are also undeveloped romance in some relationships, but it's sweet to see some hints coming about.\\n\r\nWhat I absolutely love about the story is how the park manages to develop, thanks to Kanie's direction as a manager. The workers might be negative over his choices of attracting visitors to the park, and you may be astonished too, but he managed them. The story may also not show this result, but it also drop hints too. Overall, I think the story was almost original and doesn't not have a lot of faults. Of course, many more topics in the story can be expanded, but out of thirteen episodes, I think it's a job well done for the script-writers. There is also some fan-service included that doesn't exceed too much, but you know, it's quite astonishing for KyoAni to add some. Sure, Free! is another anime with a lot of fan-service, but ignoring that anime, it is still a nice shock.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a huge cast which is quite diverse in terms of personality. How the story introduces the characters one by one is fine, since Kanie meets a few workers in the park from episode to episode. Some of the characters have a small story behind them. But what is really good about the cast is that they are never forgotten. Once they are introduced, they will eventually pop up in the next episodes. So if you have your favourite character inside, don't feel left out.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the story do focus on some of the characters. While Kanie manages the park, Sento assists him in some ways. There is some development between the two, but not very much to the point it gets romantic. Indeed, both of them have their own faults which can cause hilarity or not, given the situation they face. They are definitely different on each other in attitude-wise, but they understand each other. However, Latifah doesn't feel like as a main character but more of a plot device to make the story more dramatic. Not much interaction is seen from her, even many of the characters that don't have a larger role get more air time than her. Also, there's the three mascots, Moffle, Macaron and Tiramie, and the four Elementario fairies, Muse, Sylphy, Kobori and Salama. While the mascots serve more as a comedy piece of the story, the Elementario fairies get more development and story. It isn't really consistent but there's one episode that show more about themselves and it's great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the development is okay but not too great. More can be shown not only to Kanie and Sento alone, but also to Latifah and the rest. But given the thirteen-episode limit, it couldn't be helped anyway.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing KyoAni's anime already, I shouldn't be disappointed by its pleasing art style for this anime. The sceneries were definitely eye-grabbing, along with the details in them, the vibrant colours chosen and the lively atmosphere portrayed by the background characters. There are a lot of visual effects shown which are great, such as magical sparkles or the rustling of leaves. You've already seen it quite a lot if you watched a lot of KyoAni anime, so it shouldn't really be a surprise, yet it is so awesome. The character designs were not really original, given that the face styles are similar to other characters from KyoAni's anime. But they are detailed and nice-looking. Some of the non-human designs are definitely cool for some, wacky for the rest. The facial expressions are well-done, and I definitely love the cartoon-ish ones to express hilarity.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song, sang by AKINO with her band, has won the hearts of many with the catchy beats and groovy tunes. It's easily one of the best songs heard in this season, since it attracted a lot of attention. See that starting quote? That's the first quote in the lyrics. It's too famous indeed. I actually looped the song many times. It has a nice feel that relates to the context of the story, giving the hype for the story and the lively feel in it. The ending song is different-sounding. Sang by the voice actresses of the Elementario fairies, it is supposed to have a more calm approach. You may feel that it doesn't really match the context, but you'll get used to it. If I put it aside, it's not a bad song and it's nice. The background music is not really noticeable, but I quite like the style of it. The OST album has been released, and a quick run-through has got me interested. The voice acting is great too. Some voice actors are well-known, the rest are either new or does not have many roles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really loved the anime so much. Ignoring what has been giving the negative impressions of the anime, it's pretty much one of the best anime I've watched this season. A seemingly-interesting story and a diverse cast will not disappoint you definitely. To summarise this anime, it has great comedy from the characters and a good development of the park, thanks to a narcissist manager and an emotionless assistant. Of course, the thirteen episode feels more like an OVA than an actual episode. It still continues from the previous episode indeed, but honestly they can just stop airing at the twelfth episode.",

            "content": "Once every season, Kyoto Animation shows up and grabs the immediate attention of the entire otaku populous after announcing whatever they've been up to the past few months. Being one of the biggest and most successful animation companies in Japan, people tend to automatically just chalk down whatever they license and eagerly await it, expecting something great. But does KyoAni succeed with their latest addition, Amagi Brilliant Park? Can they truly amount to more than just their wonderfully crafted artwork?\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park (Or Amaburi for short) follows Kanie Seiya, a narcissistic and self-centered (Wait. Kanie...Kanye...I see what you did there, KyoAni) high school student andformer child-star, as he is recruited as the new manager for a failing theme park. However, this theme park is currently owned and operated by a group of people that come from the magical world of \"Maple Land\". The women are beautiful and the males all look like mascots for college football teams, which is personally my ideal picture of a magic kingdom.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the story seems a little odd, it does quickly become alluring when you find out the princess of Maple Land and former manager of the park has a sickness that prevents her from aging and resets her memory once every year. And so Kanye West Seiya must bring in a total of 500,000 visitors in a six month period in order for the Maple Landers to keep the park. If he does not succeed, Princess Frailty will lose her magic powers contained within the park and ultimately die a tragic death.\\n\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park has its ups and downs (LIKE A ROLLER COASTER. HA) but it isn't by any means bad. I found myself looking forward to it every week, just as I normally do with Kyoto Animation's stuff. But this time I didn't have to fully invest myself in the story like I had to do with sthows like Hyouka, which worked on solving mysteries and building up relationships. So, lets delve deeper as I once again break this show apart, piece by piece, to better illustrate how I feel about it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nJust like every other normal person in the world, I love clapping. The opening song to Amagi Brilliant Park utilizes clapping. Twice. That's cool, I like that. And since Kyoto Animation created the opening, the clapping looks sweet. But I digress. The anime sounds just like you'd expect a show about a theme park to sound. The music is lively and cheerful, and at the same time it delivers hope. And with Amaburi's story, that is absolutely vital. Background music isn't repetitious at all and plays an essential part in making each scene seem full. But because the music wasn't outstanding and didn't play a part in changing the way people viewed the show, it wasn't perfect and definitely could have been improved upon.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, Amaburi has a solid line-up. Kanie is quite different from the dense male leads you'll often find in anime today, and the rest of the cast is pretty solid as well. Sento Isuzu (Whose name I just found out comes from 50 Cent) does a great job in supporting Kanie's character throughout the duration of the show. And all of the mascot-men are there with extremely strong personalities to provide sufficient comic relief for the theme park. The thing is, even though the characters were very original and unique all across the board, the majority of them were ONLY there to serve as that comic relief I mentioned. It's great to be funny, but if that's your only personality trait in real life, you're probably going to have a hard time and you aren't a perfect character. I would have liked to see some more development in anyone apart from the leads, but it just didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis was probably a given as soon as Kyoto Animation's name was put under the title, but Amagi Brilliant Park delivers some of the best artwork this year. Character designs were outrageous and easily memorable, and the theme park as a whole, even when it was decaying, was a sight for sore eyes. It's refreshing to see KyoAni constantly improving and not just taking advantage of their position in the industry and settling down in a \"safe spot\". They are constantly pushing themselves to create something better, and it has been succeeding. As a reference point, please direct your attention to the Ferris wheel above. Isn't that the best damn Ferris wheel you've ever seen in an anime? You're damn right it is. Amaburi has zero issues when it comes to appearance, and that is vital in keeping the audience's interest locked in.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 \\n\r\nWhat's disappointing about the story line of this show is that they throw in a lot of information that seems like it's important, but is never mentioned again. The viewers never find out what exactly happened to cause Kanie's fallout of the entertainment industry. Sento's affections never get let out and ultimately become meaningless when you look at the bigger picture. And then Kanie goes off on this rant about how he is terrified of heights and wants to hide it from everyone but it plays no part in determining how you look at the story. And then there was the whole thing with how Kanie somehow ran into the princess when he was a child and now felt like he was destined to save her life. It just started to seem forced, like the writers wanted there to be a story when in all actuality the show was just there to be fun. The idea was good, but countless attempts to make it deeper than it should have been really ruined its legitimacy.\\n\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is a solid show, but it could have been much better. You'll find that the driving force in bringing you back to the next episode falls completely on the characters and artwork. It's definitely enjoyable, but one of the weaker shows KyoAni has brought forth in recent years, which may be a direct result of them setting the bar too high for themselves. Watch this if you are either an avid fan of the studio or just looking to have a few laughs and wind down. There are better options out there, but Amaburi will suffice if you don't want to look for them.",

            "content": "What exactly is Amagi Brilliant Park? On the basic surface, it isn\u2019t exactly brilliant with its host of generic characters. However, taking a closer glance at the show might make you think differently once you\u2019re on board with its ideas. Don\u2019t get me wrong though. Amagi Brilliant Park isn\u2019t exactly a show for everyone but it does launches itself into a realm of its own that has a unique ability to keep the audience at their seats.\r\nAdapted by the light novel of the same name, this anime series covers the first book with a bit of expansion. There are also several interesting noteworthy attributes totake into consideration about this adaptation. First, the series is written by Shoji Gatoh who is well known for his work, Full Metal Panic. Then, there\u2019s the studio in charge known as Kyoto Animation. While the studio needs little introduction, one should take notice a history of its works and realize this show is one of the first they\u2019ve done relating to such a gimmick. Rather than taking place in some school setting, the series take place in a place of modern fantasy known as the Amagi Brilliant Park.\\n\\n\r\nA fresh concept. This show can seem a bit strange at times. The first episode blasts off without wasting any time by introducing the two main protagonists \u2013 Seiya Kanie and Isuzu Sento. The oddball circumstance involves Sento going on a \u2018date\u2019 with Kanie but only then does he realize that their fun time turns into something else. As such, the show initially introduces the basic mechanics of Amagi Brilliant Park. It establishes the premise and lets the audience know what it\u2019s about, a task done quite well with the mechanics. But when it comes to characters, the show swings in a bit of an odd direction. For instance, it\u2019s easy to tell that Kanie and Sento are quite different. Kanie has a narcissist attitude with a full of confidence and pride. While on the other hand, Sento is much more stoic who shows little emotions despite her sensitive personality. When you put these two characters together as the main duo, there\u2019s a problem with compatibility. Nonetheless, the show does seize opportunities to bring the best out of them. \\n\\n\r\nIt does this often by appealing at the ideas of the show. To do this, almost every character that Kanie or Sento gets involved with plays a form of role in bringing in new customers. Because let\u2019s face it, the goal of the series is to attract 250,000 visitors to the park and if not done in 3 months will lead to closure. The show makes it clear that if the park closes, then it would seize to exist at all (literally) in the human world. This is because of the staff of the park is made of beings from another realm known as the Maple World. And for the park to function, it needs to harvest magical energy from visitors who are having fun. Simply put: no visitors, no energy, no park. The show also makes it clear that Kanie has experience in the entertainment industry early on thanks to flashbacks and his own experiences. As such, expect Kanie to bring in ideas from what he has learned to ensure that Amagi Brilliant Park reaches its goal. \\n\\n\r\nAs a show with many possibilities, most of it consists of the characters. There\u2019s a wide diversity of them whether it\u2019s a princess like Latifah Fleuranza, fairy mascots such as Moffle, the Elementario girls, or other members hired by the staff. The series gives them a variety of roles although their key purpose is to bring entertainment so that visitors come by. To say the least though, the show accomplishes its task of entertainment with the personalities of the characters. Almost all of them brings in some form of fun to the series even when timings feel off or the amount of generic concepts used. It also seems as if the show is self-aware at times because even some of the character names are originated from popular icons from the real life world. The key element to take into consideration is still entertainment as the show tries a different set of dynamics each episode. These involve the different attractions at the park such as Indiana Jones style adventures, Water Park (complete with pirates and the ship), trials and error with idol themes, or secret cave with a mythic dragon. There are still repetitive gimmicks used though such as Moffle\u2019s fury (which is resulted from his endless rivalry with Kanie), Sento\u2019s gun (that often strikes fear into almost anyone that comes near it including Kanie), or the variety of species used to bring in diversity. As such, a show such as this offers almost something for anyone when it comes to the characters. Unfortunately, characterization suffers and in fact almost non-existent. Except perhaps the princess, Sento, or Kanie, none of the other characters get background stories or development. It also seems like the show plays off of stereotypes and make certain characters (ex. Elementario girls) seem like a joke with little more than pure eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being written by the author of FMP, don\u2019t expect much similarities to it. There\u2019s no psychological scenarios or plots about the military. Instead, see this series like a showbiz. And to deliver that, the show needs to inspire comedy. While I think the series is on the right track, it occasionally tries far too hard to appeal in such a way at times. Comedy is repetitive and feels slipping away at times. There are some serious moments but some of the awkward timings feels off. However, a few of the characters are memorable for their personalities especially Kanie during key moments. One of his earlier speeches shows exactly the type of person he is despite putting on his poker face. While starving for ideas, the show does also finds ways to create opportunities to explore every aspect of its attractions through either internal or external conflict. These even include hiring new staff members, dealing with the past, and even events outside of the park. However, the endgame could be a mixed bag because like I mentioned before, this series is not for everyone. The finale of the episode also feels OVA-ish.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to visuals, Amagi Brilliant Park\u2019s technical quality nails it with its high production values thanks to Kyoto Animation. While landscapes aren\u2019t lavishly on Makoto Shinkai levels, it does have creativity ideas behind it. However, the character designs feels childish. In particular, the mascots looks like furry animals while the Elementario girls almost gives off the feeling that they are teenagers on the way to a Halloween costume party. Did I also mention fan service? The first episode has a full glimpse of that while subsequent episodes does this with bikini outfits and pirate gear. Luckily enough, the show doesn\u2019t make this as its main attraction but rather just as part of its gimmick. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack plays a few key roles. To say the least, the OP song is very catchy not just with the lyrics but by the energy it crafts with almost every character being featured; and in some moments clapping hands in unison. I also give some credit for Kanie\u2019s voice for his ability to really demonstrate his character as a perfectionist. His speeches may sometimes feel laggy but they are to the point with brutal honesty and narcissism. Other characters such as Latifah brings in a gentle atmosphere with her voice while Moffle does the exact opposite of that. However, the OST is easily forgettable even during some emotional scenes of sentimentality. \\n\\n\r\nOddly, Amagi Brilliant Park feels like an entertainment showbiz itself. The story offers a variety of ideas although it does falter whenever it tries a bit more than it should have. There is almost an ensemble like cast of characters that the audience may find attached to. Just be aware that these characters play roles like pieces to a puzzle rather than getting depth on their own. For all its technical wizardry, the show is still very much about a guy trying to do his best to save a park that definitely needs to be saved. Fans of other Kyoto Animation works may find this a bit different than what they are used to. It\u2019s not just the different main setting but also because this show plays around with itself like a roller coaster on steroids. \\n",

            "content": "Summary: Amagi Brilliant Park is a enjoyable anime if you would like to see the MC and his friend build up towards their goals. It has an alright style of conveying the characters emotions, although it has unfinished romance between some of the characters which i don't like happening in anime I watch.\r\nStory: The plot for Amagi Brilliant Park is certainly original. I haven't seen any other anime with this plot and it makes for a good change. Although they do explain why they have to run the park, I would have liked more detail in that aspect. The originality makes up for it though.8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Amagi Brilliant park catches the eye with it's style of characters. Recently there has been a development in art since the release of 1080p resolution. Well, I guess that isn't recent, but you get the point. This anime uses the new style of art - and well. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack isn't something amazing, but it suits the anime well. It makes for some emotional scenes even though most of the anime is a casual watch, and is not one of the anime that gives the feels for me. The voice actors perform well in this anime and suits what you think the character would sound like. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The main character is a bit generic, but is one of those \"never give up\" characters, which suits the anime. For me the backstories could have been told in more detail, but that is not much of a problem. Overall the characters were good. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Although I did enjoy this anime my overall opinion is mixed. I loved the art but the only downside was I would have liked more character development, although the characters were thought out well. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n",

            "content": "A carnival setting in anime, is new for me, so going into this show I didn't know what to expect, it looked colorful and bright and there was a huge cast so I had a feeling it was gonna be right up my ally. As I started my rollercoaster expecting something pretty good and maybe amazing, by the end of the rollercoaster, I just had a smile on my face, It wasn't the best ride of my life it was just good. I could sum up Amagi Brilliant Park in just that sentence itself. But this is a review! That would be too dumbwitted.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThestory here is simple, a park known as Amagi Brilliant Park (hence the name of the show) hasn't been going well, it needs to have 500,000 visitors in just a couple of months, A highschool student has agreed to be manager but only until they get 500.00 visitors by the time limit he shall thou quit. \\n\\n\r\nA straightforward story, now I like stories that are easy to understand, its a sign that the show will be more enjoyable and anyone can watch it. Now when I saw this show had 13 episodes I was afraid this show was gonna be rushed but shockingly its the perfect run time for a show like this, didn't see that coming huh? \\n\\n\r\nI don't have too much to say about the story, its simple and good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty well done here, with some really nice backgrounds and colorful art style it just shines here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nThe music is upbeat and fun. The OP is like a rollercoaster that never stops....until the OP finishes. The ED is Ok for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7/10\\n\r\nFirst we have Saiya. a highschool student who loves himself so much that he denys girls, HA GAY! Well other than that he is a fucking honest and brutal MC, he runs the park like he means it, the creators had balls to make the MC like this compared to other male MCs in modern anime, I give props to that.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Isuzu, Saiya's co-worker, a mindless woman who literally threatens people with some shotgun just to get work done. It seems pretty funny when she stops bad problems using her shotgun. Other than that, she hardly changes throughout the series, by the end of the show she's still the same as the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThere's meant to be some kind of relationship between Isuzu and Saiya, there's lots of potential for character development, but as soon as it can happen in scenes where the two are alone, it just fails to deliver and they're back to root one co-workers. Even in the last episode there's so many chances but the show acts like noting happened.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThis show is episodic for the most part, each episode has its own story and problems and more visitors round up in. It keeps going till the last episode. Now its good this wasn't 24 episodes, cause that would be very repetitive. The comedy in this show is pretty good, there's some chuck-worthy moments and scenes where I was laughing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is a good show that delivers what it can do, it shines in its art and sound and does fairly well in its story and characters, give this show a go, you'll probably enjoy it. In the end Amagi Brilliant Park was an enjoyable rollercoaster that'll leave you with a smile on your face.",

            "content": "When I heard of this anime I thought the concept sounded ridiculous. A highschool boy becomes the manager of a magical theme park in an attempt to save its workers from doom. To be honest, it is ridiculous. There's no way around that. Luckily, this anime is so fun and entertaining that it's easy to forget how stupid it should be.\r\nThe characters help this aspect a lot. All of the main characters get ample development, and a lot of the side characters as well. This helps pull the anime through some of its sillier scenes, and lends weight to what should be cheesy dramatic momentssprinkled here and there. \\n\\n\r\nBoth the animation and sound are spectacular. There are many memorable bgms, and the opening song is a good way to get fired up for the next episode. The animations and art are precise and colorful, with some surprising flair to be found every once in awhile.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of comedies. You could even refer to me as a killjoy. However, this anime made me laugh more often than not. There were some comedic misses here and there, but if something can make you laugh even once, then it succeeds as a comedy. Together with some pleasantly heartwarming scenes and endearing characters, this anime manages to avoid the trainwreck it so easily could have been. Worth a watch if you are in the mood for a light, funny, heartfelt dramedy.",

            "content": "To be honest, I only considered watching Amagi Brilliant Park because it's Kyoto Animation. But what kept me watching is my love for theme parks.\r\nI really thought Amaburi would be an exposition, showing its viewers true-to-life behind the scenes and nitty-gritty aspects of a particular object (in this case, a theme park) - something like Shirobako with anime making - plus an added fantasy in the side. I suppose it is that kind of anime in its own way. Only, most of the elements you encounter are improbable. It's a fantasy anime, no doubt about it.\r\nAmaburi's art is its most dazzling feat. It's nothing lessfrom KyoAni. Its visuals are colorful, vibrant, and fluid befitting that of a theme park. KyoAni hasn't innovated its character design that much but it still packs a punch in Amaburi. Kanie's, for example, can put the Iwatobi boys' to shame.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the series suffers the most is the story. The first two episodes give us a trajectory. The setting may be cliche in its execution but it gave us a clear goal.\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, the succeeding episodes are loaded with filler stories that may or may not make sense and only give the slightest intent of ever reaching that goal. They may give us an inkling of what is needed to run a theme park but they're nothing more than run-of-the-mill antics with a touch of the improbable. I honestly think KyoAni could have done a better job if they put a little more thought and effort in building the fillers.\\n\\n\r\nThe overarching story is put back in focus in the last five episodes. The series manages to save itself as it slowly unfolds a cute, charming little story amusing enough to keep me watching until the last episode. It is the biggest plus side after that mess of a middle. Save for a few plot holes and open-endings, I can say that Amaburi ended well enough.\\n\\n\r\nWith its characterization, Amaburi keeps it simple. But with its diversity of characters, development was disordered. For some characters, you'll see them grow as the series progresses and for the others, there is almost no development at all.\\n\\n\r\nIt hits most of what we can expect from an effort by KyoAni - consistent visuals, top-notch character design, and a whole lot of fan service. After Free! and Kyoukai no Kanata, I would have asked for more. But with its variety of scenes, AmaBuri proves how versatile the studio is.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Amagi Brilliant Park is a roller coaster ride. It takes you up and down and through the unexpected and ends abruptly enough for you to want more. It may not be the best of what KyoAni has to offer but it is a good addition to their opus. I would recommend this to anyone looking for lighthearted entertainment.",

The story was well set up and introduced with easy to recognise and interesting characters. the first 4/5 episodes are related to the over-arching story of needing guests with a few \"character helping\" episodes in between before finishing the main story. i normally hate this format as it means my fat 300lb ass has to sit through more aneemay and spend less time shaking hands with my man downstairs but it was very enjoyable, each episode had itsown charm and interesting conflict, i was never once bored watching this show. it was well combined humour and character/plot development. at 12 episodes long, it did well to tell a good story with a decent level of depth in an entertaining manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest point of this show by far was the characters. I dont think ive ever liked a set of characters as much as this set. \\n\r\n  The main character in particular was one of the most \"normal\" well rounded characters ive seen. It pisses me off when the main characters of typical shows get all shy when talking to girls, shy when bikini/sex related stuff comes up and just tries to be a goody two shoes in general. He was real, he did things to piss people off, he played the bad guy, he could actually hold a conversation with an attractive girl (much like me irl m'lady *tips federer* (yes i am single. my number is 6942042069)) he wasnt over exaggerated and did shit done without being too personal about it. No i am not homo for this guy but he was funny, had a complex and has a great bum. \\n\r\n  the supporting cast was also well constructed with sufficient development to the extent that i could enjoy every appearance. the three bunnies in the costume were particularly hilarious. their male urges displayed by such a cute and innocent exterior was refreshing to say the least and very all around entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nThere wasnt much i didnt like about the show. The power thing that he gets is rarely used and is almost unnecessary to the point i forgot, on multiple occasions, he even had it. I felt the teaser you get for the next episode is pretty redundant and of course i wanted the main character to fulfil my dreams of tipping all the federers in the world towards the general direction of sento isuzu aka nicetitty-would-let-her-dominate-me-with-whipped-cream-and-dongers gun girl. it is no secret that fat carlton on MAL is a romcom lover and i ship the fuck out of those two like the titanic and the bottom of the atlantic.\\n\\n\r\nIts just a short fun anime with a simple story and good characters that is fun, entertaining and funny for all ages.",

            "content": "Ah, amusement parks.  Disney world, Six Flags, Oceanworld, Japan's DisneySea, we all have wonderful, wonderful memories in them with our families and friends.  But have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes?  (Probably not)  But thankfully, Amagi Brilliant Park gives us this answer in a very nicely done comedic sense.\r\nStory (7.33/10):  Held against a wall against his will, Kanie Seiya is threatened with his life by a girl at his school by the name of Isuzu Sento, who is holding him by gunpoint.  After being asked (more like forced) to go on a date with her to anamusement park, he reluctantly goes, before seeing the poor, poor state that Amagi Brilliant Park is in.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story of Amagi follows a rather simple plot line.  As being appointed as the manager of the park, the story follows Kanie as he attempts to make up ways to build up Amagi's popularity and visitor count, thinking of a new harebrained scheme each episode in order to do it.  In addition with this plot line, the show builds up its character count by adding in more and more side characters as the story goes from episode to episode.  The plot line does work very well for the series and does a great deal of positive things for it, however, there are a couple things that do bring the series down a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOne of bigger flaws for the series is character development.  For the main three characters: Kanie, Sento, and Latifa, the show gives each of them a bit of a backstory for each of them, explaining a little bit about their character and why they are the way they are.  The only problem with this is due to how little it is.  The show is good in its characters because they're interesting.  The backstories are genuinely interesting.  However, it was a bit disappointing seeing that the characters didn't get as much development as they could've because I would've liked to see more of what what made them into what they are.\\n\\n\r\nStill though, the story overall was good to watch.  The comedy was decently done and the general pacing of the show was good.  Personally, I found myself enjoying the show a lot and looked forward to every episode.  Every episode except the last one was good.  The only reason why the last one felt bad was because it felt REALLY out of place.  I personally would've put it a 1 or 2 episodes back before the last one because it didn't really make sense to put it as the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good story\\n\r\n+  Good comedy\\n\r\n+  Good pacing\\n\r\n-   Not enough character development\\n\r\n-   Out of place last episode\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.61/10):  The characters for Amagi were definitely a very interesting and memorable bunch to watch.  I can guarantee that these characters will stick in your head long after you've finished the series.\\n\\n\r\nKanie Seiya is the main protagonist of the series.  Kanie is a self-proclaimed genius, thinking of himself that he's good-looking and the center of the world.  (His character is named after Kanye West.  No surprise his character reflects it.)  As a previous child star, Kanie has knowledge over what makes things popular and makes uses of that expertise as a way to make Amagi more popular and appealing to the public.  As the series goes on, you can see Kanie grow as a character as he puts in his time and effort into the Park.  The development is really nice to see and really shows how development can be put into any series.  As a downside however, his character isn't really explored beyond how he's a child star.  They don't explain why he got out of it, or why he went into it into the first place, which really was a downer considering how much more it could've added to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Isuzu Sento, the Kuudere secretary to Kanie.  Sento is a very interesting character because she doesn't really have much on the surface, but she really becomes a memorable character.  Her backstory doesn't really extend beyond the fact that she's a guard, which is also really disappointing because you don't really get to know very much.  Her most defining characteristic is her gun, which apparently, she can pull out of any exposed skin, which makes for some decent character moments.  Beyond that, as well as her lack of understanding situations, she doesn't get very much.  Regardless though, she is still quite a memorable character and does make for a nice secondary main character.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to these two, there are the other characters which I would consider to be main characters, those characters being Latifa, Moffle, Tiramie, and Macaron.  The first one being the other main character, the other three being the three drunk stooges of the series.  Let's start with Latifa.  Latifa is what I would consider to be an underused character.  In the series, she's not really made out to be a prominent character, but more like an important character that doesn't show up much kind of character.  She doesn't have a very large presence in the series overall, and mostly only gets proper screentime and plot importance later on.  She has a decent enough backstory to support her character, but I really wish we could get a little bit more from her timewise because she was an adored character that we don't really get to see.  The other three I mentioned play as a sort of comedy trio, being somewhat essential to the plot by being the park's main three mascots, creating comedy moments and sometimes conflict, along the way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the series does have lacking as well were some proper character usage.  Most notably, the four elementario fairies.  Personally, I would've liked to see Sylphid, Muse, Kobiri, and Salama have a lot more screentime in the series.  The series went to the effort of devoting the ending song to these four, making them the star of it, which really didn't reflect on how they were treated in the series since they really only got one episode to devote to them, making them just as important as all the other side characters in the series.  Amagi made them look more important than they actually were, so that was a bit disappointing to see.\\n\\n\r\nApart from them, we have side characters, a lot of them.  in every single episode, the series introduces new members of the park, both new ones and ones we haven't met, adding to the ever expanding cast.  What makes these supporting cast members somewhat memorable is both their design, and how they make use of their small bits of screentime.  (But mostly their appearance)  They make the park seem populated with workers, and that's really about all they do.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Memorable cast\\n\r\n+  Interesting main characters\\n\r\n+/-  Unfinished character development\\n\r\n-  Supporting cast was a bit too expansive and some weren't handled too well\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.08/10):  Amagi was produced by Kyoto Animation, the same studio that did Haruhi and Lucky Star.  The animation for Amagi does look very high quality.  The colors for the show are very bright-looking, giving off that storybook/fairytale kind of feel due to how primary and light all the characters look.  In addition, the characters look rather simple.  There's not an absurd amount of decoration in them, but they look very pleasing to the eye.  All in all, the art is definitely fantastic to look at.  It's nice and simple, crafted very nicely, but it isn't particularly standout in comparison to other shows.  (That being said, we do have this show to thank for the phrase \"Kyo-Ani Butt\")\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, the show boasts a good duo of opening and ending songs with each of them serving different purposes.  The opening sort of gives off the tone of what you can expect when watching Amagi, starting with a wind-up music box tone before showering you with chords, saying that you're not watching a fairy tale, this is real, and it's fantastic.  In contrast, the ending does the opposite, giving off a whimsical tone and sound as it sings about the elemntario fairies and the four elements that they \"control\" (since they can barely summon water, wind, earth, or fire.)  The ending may or may not stick to your head, but the opening surely can.  (Just listen to the first 10 seconds if you don't know what I'm talking about.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good art  \\n\r\n+  Memorable music\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.33/10):  Kyo-Ani has been a good studio for me to watch from.  The stuff that they produce appeals to me and gives me a sense of enjoyment.  This show was no different.  When I found the concept of an amusement park being an anime setting, I thought to myself, \"Ok, what kind of shit are they going to make here?\", cause anime has decent comedy from a lot of different settings.  (such as high school, working at a family restaurant, and even about buying from a supermarket for god's sakes.)  When I watched the show, I was pleasantly surprised, keeping at it because this was a show I genuinely enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I did.  The show did keep me intrigued by switching the focus from one part of the park to another, keeping the show fresh with new side characters in order to give the audience a new experience.  In addition, the show did add character growth to its main protagonist, which was a nice plus for the series.  Also, the freaking fairies in this series drink beer.  Have you ever seen a violent mouse with a hat, a perverted pink cat, and a dissatisfied sheep guzzle a couple pints like it was their life?  Thought so.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nWell, aside from the horrendously out of place final episode, the show didn't really make use of the backstories that it had set for some of its characters.  We don't really get to know why Kanie quit his child star career, or why that last-minute protagonist did what he did, or even like the future of Amagi.  Cause I really want to know what happens afterwords.  The main characters didn't get I feel, enough of a backstory.  They feel incomplete, and I wish we could get just a little bit more bang for our 30 yen entry fee.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, yes, I would.  It's a great little comedy series that doesn't really take itself too seriously.  It's a nice comedy show that provides some very memorable characters, and even a few choice moments that are actually quite memorable.  While the character development is a bit lacking in that department, and the large amount of side characters may or may not be distracting, Amagi Brilliant Park is a nice place to visit, and I hope you may all visit again.  \\n\\n\r\nP.S.  Salama best girl.  You are free to disagree in my comments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.48/10",

            "content": "\u201cSimply put, we need to go lewder. Miniskirts! Swimsuits! Low-Angle Shots! You need to put in as many of those as you can without breaking the law.\u201d\r\n-Amagi Brilliant Park, Episode 13\r\nAnother season, another project by KyoAni unfolded to the masses. Though it seems as though KyoAni\u2019s latest attempt at trying to appeal to the anime demographic that loves cute and sexy girls is now back in full fashion, I\u2019d think of Amagi Brilliant Park as their apology to all the people who were whining about the \u201cgayness\u201d that KyoAni was ostracizing with their recent hit, \u201cFree!\u201d. Hey, they can make whatever they please, and wecan judge whether it\u2019s worthy of being timeless in their long successful history. In which case Amagi Brilliant Park will only be seen as just another Kyoukai no Kanata; a filler show.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas Kyoukai no Kanata fell vastly short even to be called a memorable show, a filler show at that, Amagi Brilliant Park is at least commendable to be called a filler show. In the strictest sense, what made me make this distinction while watching this show was how appropriately tame it is with how it portrays the story and setting. Everything is lighthearted, for the most part, and easy for the mind to sit back and relax in pure escapism. As with every anime comedy, there are cute girls in it. KyoAni indeed hasn\u2019t failed on giving us quality girls as opposed to other aspects to an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the main characters are fueled by their appearances and personalities that spark up a great deal of charm to their archetypes. Latifa is typically the girly girl part of the cast that is always optimistic and smiling so we can view her innocence and glamour. Not necessarily the best character considering her backstory is quite exaggerated in the most apathetic way possible, but nothing terrible either. However, there is Isuzu. Quite possibly the one saving grace to the show in her hilarious stoic demeanor. Hilarious in the sense that when she breaks character and starts showing emotion, you have no choice but to squeal with ultimate delight. Plus, you can\u2019t be a true man if you refuse her offer to paizuri you.\\n\\n\r\nBesides our two main girls, our male protagonist, Seiya Kanie, isn\u2019t anything special. He doesn\u2019t offer any nuanced grandeur to make him stand out like any other memorable KyoAni protagonists before him. But the real crux of the cast are the supporting cast, and there are a lot of them. The problem with this is how so little of the supporting cast barely have anything to make them seem unique other than just being weird mascot characters that are hardly significant in any way. Sure, some of them, particularly Moffle and Tiramie, have some funny moments, but its a quick little comedic pick me up before it\u2019s later tossed away by another funny moment.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does make Amagi Brilliant Park unique amongst other of KyoAni\u2019s projects is just how vibrant and colorful they\u2019ve made their art and animation. Earlier in KyoAni\u2019s career, they\u2019ve tried to make their characters seem more realistic despite just relying on the moe-blob formula. They\u2019re still present in here, but what makes this refreshing is how they implement the cartoonish aesthetic to the different characters. Besides our human characters, it\u2019s nice to see KyoAni make these adorable animal mascots and give some spark of creativity to how they interact with their bodies and to each other.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing\u2026.oh wait, I forgot about the story. Wait, honestly, what story is there to critique? It\u2019s almost 2nd nature to Amagi Brilliant Park. All there is to service a plot is the characters trying to keep their amusement park from closing down. But the only problem is that they fail even to make that an issue that I should care about since all the fanservice and cute characters drown it out like white noise. Its one of those situations where the show falls flat on story but, then again, that isn\u2019t the whole point, and even the show itself makes this clear as day. When you first show a girl dressed up as a pirate girl in a bikini, your only response is to clap slowly in amusement and go, \u201cYeah okay, I\u2019ll let this be passable in any measure.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s how Amagi Brilliant Park can be described into one word: passable. Just a bit above passable to where it can be labeled decent in the critical spectrum. As far as KyoAni shows, to which I\u2019ve become not fond of even when they were in their \u201cgolden age,\u201d it will nonetheless entertain with enjoyable comedy to splendor about. Sure it\u2019s another show centered around cute girls, but when you see the sight of Isuzu in a cheerleader bikini outfit, it\u2019s a sight that is more than just moe; it\u2019s life.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR - Fun for all ages\r\nWatching Amagi Brilliant Park is refreshing.  You are not watching some kids trying to save the world, or some evil zombie feast, or even (un)popular-guy-loved-by-every-girl-he-talks-to.  Aamgi Brilliant Park is brilliant, entertaining and never fails to amaze.\r\n(MOSTLY) GOOD - Story\r\nThe series quickly established the premise: the run-down Amagi Brilliant Park, owned by a princess from a land of magic, is in dire situation.  Unless it reaches the yearly quota of half a million visitors in the next three months, it faces foreclosure.  The only saviour is in the form of Kanie Seiya, a narcissistic high school studentwho, after much needed coaxing, promised to help out as the park's new manager.\\n\\n\r\nTheme park management is probably the last thing you have in mind when it comes to anime.  It works brilliantly as a game (too many theme park sim game to name here), but as an anime, you might think that it would be a tough nut to crack.  Well, Amaburi gladly proves you wrong.  Amaburi is one of the funniest anime in recent time, and it comes down to the story and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is an adventure.  Being a comedy, one would expect the adventure to turn into something that never goes according to plan.  The comedy hits just the right spot at the right time.  Sometimes it is when you least expected it and sometimes you can see it from miles away.  Each episode is a self-contained story, with the overall arc being played out in the background.  That is, until the last few episodes when it is number crunching time.  That's when the story picks up pace.  Rest assured, the ending is well written (for the most part) without feeling rushed.  In fact, I think the series has good pace overall.\\n\\n\r\nWithout the overarching story of the threat of closure, this anime could go on forever.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I like about this anime is that it does not rely (solely) on ecchi to sell the show.  Sure, you get great fan service (check out those racks on Sento!), but they only tell part of the story.  This show is driven by the humorous writing and great characters.  You would develop feelings for the park as it is transferred from the ICU to the general ward as it can now breathe normally without life support.  But will the park be able to leave the hospital in full health, or will its condition suddenly turn south?  You will have to watch it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Amaburi is not without its problem.  Because each episode is a self-contained story, sometimes it loses track of the overall picture.  Sure, they are great fun to watch.  But it might not actually have anything to do with saving the park.  I feel that some of the episodes could be done as an OVA while the main series should be concentrated on how Kanie uses his (alleged) brilliance to save the park from collapse.\\n\\n\r\nGOOD - Character development\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of characters in Amagi Brilliant Park, but we only get to know a handful of them.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who we do get to see, they are well rounded and full of energy.  Each character has his / her own personality, not your typical cardboard cut-out character.  Kanie Seiya, while being an egoistic teenager, is actually quite caring and loves his job.  Isuzu Sento is a stoic blank face on the surface, but she has a great sense of responsibility and would do anything in her ability to complete her task.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters like the three main mascots and the four elementary fairies are well loved and have a great sense of humour.  Those viewers with keen eyes might recognise the remarkable resemblance between Moffle and Bonta-kun\u2019s from Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu.  And given the nature of FMP? Fumoffu, one could not be faulted for associating Moffle with comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe three mascots in particular (Macaron, Tiramie and Moffle) is a major source of entertainment.  Macaron is divorced and refused to pay child support, Tiramie is really a pervert at heart, and Moffle has a violent tendency.  You really can't judge the book by its cover.\\n\\n\r\nOne strength of the series is letting the characters shine in their own light.  There are episodes where our main characters have little impact on the outcome.  However, this is a double edged sword.  As it stands, letting other characters take the spotlight unfortunately detract the main story line.  A better way would have been letting other characters come up with ways to resolve some of the issues facing the park, rather than the scenarios that ended up in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI would love to see other characters being introduced in the series, but sadly, the anime is too short to fully explore the so many lively characters that is employed in the park.\\n\\n\r\nGOOD - Animation\\n\\n\r\nThe background is colourful and vibrant.  The drawings are crisp, and animation is smooth.  Character design is adequate.  The three main mascots are mascots, so you do not get to see costumes changes.  Other mascots stays the same throughout the series.   Kanie and Isuzu mostly donned the Amaburi uniform, albeit with seasonal variants.  I can count on two hands the number of outfits that Sento wears.\\n\\n\r\nIf fan service is what you are after, there are plenty of that too, though not as much as the creators wanted them to be.  But then again, there is something call the 'internet'.  Some search results might come up quite 'revealing'.\\n\\n\r\nBAD - Not Enough Kanie Magic\\n\\n\r\nI might be nit-picking here, but we have already established in the first episode that Kanie has been gifted with magic that can read minds.  Unfortunately we don't get to see nearly enough instances where his uses magic to his advantage.  We see Isuzu with her guns from you-know-where, I mean, god-knows-where magic trick every second episode, but in the case of Kanie, I think it has potential to make a regular appearance.  Maybe we can get some comedy out of him reading the minds of guests.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nThe eponymous Amagi Brilliant Park is anything but brilliant.  The park is in such disarray that it is a surprise that there are visitor at all.  But through aggressive marketing and the (alleged) brilliance of Kanie's management skills, the park is slowly brought back to life.  The anime is a journey to that end.  Though it sometimes detracts from its main goal, Amaburi managed to stay on track long enough to keep the audience interested.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a great fun to watch, though that are many potential areas that are left untouched.  Hopefully they could be addressed / expand in future seasons.  Every character has his/her own personality that makes the team so different and dynamic.  The OP and ED have the typical JPOP feel, and the music, though not memorable, is quite soothing to listen to.  The animation is marvellous.  Plot is great, entertainment and funny.  If only the series was longer.",

            "content": "Amagi Brilliant Park is a Fantasy, Romantic Comedy anime, where Seiya Kanie is asked to help the park from closing by attracting 250,000 visitors because the staff of the park are from a magical realm called Maple Land and the park is really a facility thats harvests a magical energy form visitors while they are having fun, so they can maintain their existence in the human realm. So as you can see just a normal anime plot, ok really it a really good concept and is very interesting, and i promise the story is really good as they face different situations each episode while tryingto get visitors need to keep the park open. Each episode will surprise, make you laugh and what they do about getting people to come to the park. \\n\r\nNow on to the characters, now i only going to to talk about the main three characters because there is a lot of characters in this anime and i not going too much information about them as the anime does a good job explaining what the characters are like and somethings about main characters are story spoilers. First up is the man himself, Seiya Kanie (Voiced by K\u014dki Uchiyama), He is a high school student that is highly intelligence, excellent reflexes, has a sharp mind and a narcissist. He is asked by Latifah, the princess of Maple Land to become the manager because of being in the entertainment business before. Next is Isuzu Sento (Voiced by Ai Kakuma), is a royal guard to the princess who carries a rife called Steinberger and is the one to get Kanie to go to the park by forcing him at gun point. She rarely shows emotion, but she hides a very sensitive side. Her gun can be summon from any exposed skin as it is infused magical to her body. After Kanie becomes the manager of the park, she starts developing feelings for him, even if she dislike is arrogant demeanor. The last main character is Latifah Fleuranza (Voiced by Yukiyo Fujii), she is the princess of Maple Land and she asked Sento have Kanie meet her. Due for some reason which is about her frail body, she can't stay to far from the castle in the park. I would talk more about her and the other characters, but because of spoilers i can't say more but trust me, the characters are very well made. \\n\r\nNext is presentation, Amagi Brilliant Park is very much colorful and the looks like a very will made anime. It using a similar art design as Is the Order a Rabbit?, as the character are alive with color, the scenery is very lively and overall is very well designed. The characters' animations on screen are smooth, their facial expressions and body language are realistic. Next is the sound/voice acting, the music used for the opening song is very catchy as it beat fits the style of the anime quite well. The ending song is beautiful as the artwork shown when it played is great. The background sounds and music are well created and really fit the feel of a amusement park and the voice acting is very well done as every voice fit it character quite well. Lastly the topics used in the story are well written and doesn't seen out of place and very Interesting.\\n\r\nNow my thoughts about the anime. Amagi Brilliant Park is a very well written anime as it doesn't leave any plot point unfinished by the end of the show. It is very funny and it has a very magical way to make you care about the characters i really can't explain. The characters are very well created and i love them all, but i really like Sento because all i can say her answers to problems is great. Overall i think the anime has been created with a lot of care and has a great story that all can enjoy. I recommend this to everyone as even if a very few scenes are little questionable, all in all it just really fun to watch.\\n\r\nWith that said, Amagi Brilliant Park is an anime that should be watch as it concept is unique as there not really an anime like it and can be enjoyed by all ages. If you like unique concepts, liked Is The Order a Rabbit?, just like anime or look to see what anime is like, then i would recommend Amagi Brilliant Park.",

            "content": "I'm really glad I watched Amagi Brilliant Park, one reason being it stems away from the generic storyline of anime its kind. ABP is best described as having a \"slice of business\" vibe with a magic orientated twist, making the comedy aspect a lot smoother and unique throughout the show. What's not unique or amusing about a bunch of drunk, lewd-minded mascots running around a magical decrepit amusement park? \r\nI honestly thought every aspect of this anime was really well balanced. Not too many jokes, the jokes they did have were actually funny since the character development was decent and the romance didn't flood thestoryline which left it simple and light hearted enough to sit back and enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters were well designed, leaving me with a major crush on Isuzu. She wasn't your average brain dead hot girl in a cute uniform, she was a blunt, seemingly insensitive bad ass with an awesome gun, PLUS the cute uniform. Despite how cold she comes across, throughout the show it becomes more apparent how sensitive and misunderstood Isuzu is, making her more relatable.\\n\\n\r\nSeiya Kanie also wasn't your typical male protagonist, his irritating, perfectionist-totally conceded vibe was portrayed well enough to leave you somehow still loving him. Yeah, he's a cocky prince, but through his hard work and time at the park it's made apparent he's a kind-hearted, caring and overall lovable one at that.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the shows short length, the rest of the cast were all well developed. Very unique and dynamic characters, not just boring background noise. They added a very nice touch to the show and really shaped the perfect atmosphere for the park. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Very vivid and colourful, a definite pleasant watch. Made me fall in love with all the characters. That HD baby.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not much to say really, nothing special but definitely above average. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Definitely worth a watch if you're down to relax to a unique, quirky show with brilliant(heh) artwork. \\n",

            "content": "How could a perfect, prior child actor, mythical princess, rage-stricken mouse and a perverted pink pomeranian (alliteration much?) recover a slumbering theme park from to its old days of glory?  I'll admit, I literally had no idea how the hell that was going to happen before I tuned into Amagi Brilliant Park.  This is one of those shows that grabbed my goldfish attention span with a sticky glove and refused to let me get to my ever-growing backlog.  I was in the mood for a lighthearted series with lots of laughs and colorful pizzazz, nothing more.  What Amagi delivered ended upbeing a pleasant surprise in the slew of mediocre shows coming out these days.  And I don't give out 7's to just any show \u2026 well maybe I do.\\n\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is a story about a perfectionist high school student named Seiya Kanie with a knack of pissing off literally everyone around him with his incessant narcissism.  I mean the dude is named after Kanye West! I feel that speaks volumes of his character and personality from the get go.  Through a date arrangement with a fairy royal guard member named Isuzu Sento, he is tirelessly recruited into helping a magical theme park help to restore its popularity and subsequent revenues in order to stay in business.  The entire effort is led by a frail Princess named Latifah Leuranza (named after Queen Latifah herself) who was crippled by a magical wizard and forced into a permanent form of a 14 year old for eternity.  I know this sounds ridiculous (and it is), but bear with me.  Once Seiya delves deeper into helping the park's members out, he quickly realizes how deep in doodoo they actually are.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't generic by any means, so I have to award some credit for originality.  However, it doesn't entirely avoid pitfalls that most short animes fall into (plot holes, under-developed antagonists).  Also, although adapted from a Light Novel by Shoji Gatoh, there are certain parts of the this adaptation that didn't translate over to the anime.  I tend to forgive this small issue, since I don't really read manga to begin with.  I mean, think of how many movies differ from their associated novels.  Seiya has a large number of interesting interactions with the other park employees as well, including plentiful physical altercations with Latifah's uncle Moffle (yes, he's actually a mouse and yes, he's the same Moffle from Full Metal Panic if you didn't already realize that).  At first, it just seems as though the reasoning for Amagi Brilliant Park needing to acquire more guests and popularity is purely monetary, but an unfolding backstory backstory of how the park was created sheds new light on that opinion.  Since the park is \u201cmagical\u201d, it relies on assimilated energy from the guests happiness due to visiting the park to stay in operation.\\n\\n\r\nAll magic and character antics aside, the writers actually do a decent job at making you feel a sense of empathy for the magical fairies that reside at the park.  You end up cheering them on to get the amount of guests they need for that day, as well as shedding tears when things don't quite go their way.  Seiya does a fantastic job at playing the leader and manager as well, and he's initially very honest with them about how much they suck at being adequate magical carneys.  I mean that IS what they are, right?  Also, through the weeds of hilarity and vulgarity, there are quite a number of uplifting morals contained in Amagi.  I wouldn't necessarily let young children watch it (thanks Tiramie!), but even the pretentious intellectuals of the anime community could find one less anime to shit on for not being intellectually challenging enough. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a boat load of characters to enjoy in Amagi Brilliant Park.  Seiya is initially the MC you love to hate, constantly admiring himself in the mirror and putting his vanity on display, but he contains a reasonable amount of depth as the series progresses.  Not only do we get to understand why he is such an asshole, but the writers also shed some light on his child-acting past and his previous ties to Amagi Brilliant Park itself.  I always enjoy animes with protagonists I don't want to take a figurative shit all over due to their annoying sense tropey-ness.  Isuzu is a great character balance to Seiya in many ways.  She's no yandere, but she does have deadpan humor (or no humor for that reason), and can tend to violently police Seiya and the other members of Amagi's cast.  Not to mention that she's got the looks and endowment to make her a staple on any pleb's waifu list.  I wouldn't be surprised if one or more otakus out there had a pillow made of her after the show aired.  Latifah is frail and often passes out during periods of too much physical exertion, but she does make some good food.  Oddly enough, she was also blind in the light novel, but perhaps the anime directors assumed this would distract viewers from the rest of the story.  Besides her over-arcing role, she didn't really get much more depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast has something for everyone.  The aforementioned anime-jumping Moffle often scuffles with Seiya, and he has a tendency to fly off the handle, but when it comes to his niece Latifah, he plays a softy in every way.  Moffles best friends are Tiramie, a pink pomeranian and Macaron, a male sheep who plays the violin and can be somewhat of a dead beat.  Tiramie is hands down one of the funniest anime characters I've ever come across.  The constant perverted jokes and cat-calls he makes at women coupled with a love for explosives ensures there's never a dull moment with him around.  I literally went almost the entire show without realizing he was not a girl.  This dude is fucking hilarious! There's also 4 voluptuous vixens that double as the Elementario fairies, each with a unique personality but they often fight as a result.  They provide the seemingly necessary fan service in Amagi.  This anime has such an insane amount of characters, that I couldn't list them all, but due to this a problem arises with character development.  It's really only there for Seiya and Isuzu.  I would almost argue that this show doesn't need it to keep me entertained, but it would probably catapult even higher on my list if that were the case.\\n\\n\r\nIt can be really hard to rate the art in modern animes.  I mean, it's kind of all starting to look the same if you think about it.  In Amagi's case, the art style neither helps nor hurts it as an overall series.  It's pretty to look at, but if you really pick it apart I'm sure you could find plenty of tiny things that would irritate your pompous critical side.  I can applaud the relatively complex character models this series possesses between the animals and inanimate objects that are personified and made lively and colorful.  The voice acting is well done, and not to sound like a fanboy or anything, but Ai Nonaka did fantastic as Tiramie.  Well, at least I was correct in my presuming the role was played by a girl...  I also thoroughly enjoyed the opening of Amagi.  It really pumps you up for each episode.  I feel that an OP should either add some depth to the series, or get you excited for the upcoming episode.  Sometimes it's like the producers say, \u201chere's this semi-intelligent premise, oh and here is some random ass OP that has completely ruins the vibe the show was going for.\u201d  The ED was nothing special, and being that it was only 12 episodes, I felt that it was better to just binge instead.  Sound effects were spot on, and the rest of the OST was okay, but I never really noticed there was background music to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Amagi Brilliant Park for what it was.  The series was a slight anecdote to my backlog and it fill well as both a comedy and a motivational genre.  I would recommend this series to someone who just wants to take a break from all the shounen or serious animes they've been watching as of late.  Although I don't expect this world to be explored again, I think it act as a pillar for a series of sequels, if it were in the writer's future plans.  Thanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "Ahh Amagi Brilliant Park, hyped because it is animated by the legendary Kyoto Animation...and rightfully so. I will try to not spoil anything, though I am not very experienced with writing reviews so we shall see how this goes, please understand Senpai.\r\n Amagi Brilliant Park boasts beautiful animation and a beautiful soundtrack (I love the opening theme). Kyoto Animation does what they do best with stunning art and a memorable soundtrack, combined with a frenzy of laughs. Every episode is humorous and worth the watch, never does an episode seem to overstay its welcome (If only all comedies could be like this). \r\nOur main character.Kanie,is dragged to an amusement park by fellow student Sento (sound familiar? Well kinda) Where he is told that he must help magical strangers attract guests, with the intention of saving the park. Kanie must hit a target goal of 500,000, or the park will be shutdown. Seems rather lighthearted, and it really is, however as we move along we see a plot start to develop, one that really brings out the hero (If that is really a word to describe Kanie)  in our lovable mc Kanie. \\n\\n\r\nKanie may be the center of attention, but the other characters get a solid share of the spotlight. Each character contributes to the comedy in his or her own unique way. Each one has it's own purpose and none of the characters feel out of place...or maybe they are all out of place so it works out...idk. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Amagi Brilliant Park is not on my \"must watch\" list when recommending anime to friends, but it is however just below that magical. I would recommend Amagi Brilliant Park to anyone looking for a lighthearted anime. The comedy is well executed, and is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack and beautiful art. It does not introduce any new concepts, but it is a great example of the tried and true, and if you give this enjoyable series a watch, you might just find something magical.",

After that, it switches to a slice of life and comedy style of story telling, where this goal is still present, but in a background in a unintrusive form. I think it helps to enjoy the characters and the fantasy elements even more.\r\nThe anime adapts the light novels in a non-chronological order and changes afew details in characters. Although these details are not that important and will not make the anime feel chaotic and out of touch with the novels. (I would pick up the light novels, but there is no translation group that picked it up and yen press didn't license it so far.)\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is dominant during the story. Well, he is more of an \"OK\" character, but I had more fun and enjoyment with the fantasy side characters. The way they adapted to the world is hilarious. They have the best lines and moments in the story.",

            "content": "Amagi Brilliant Park is a high energy, fun comedy anime with a large amount of characters that all have their own unique personalities. There has been a lot of hype built around this anime, many people saying that this is a must watch, one of the best anime of the fall 2014 season, possibly one of the best of 2014.\r\nI for one, did not receive any of said hype, and didn't watch while the show was still airing. I eventually started watching Amagi Brilliant Park a few months later, and boy did I miss out on something amazing!\r\nSummary: It begins by introducing our self absorbedMC, Seiya Kanie, who has been forced to go on a \"date\" to an amusement park by our main heroine, Isuzu Seno. From this, he is brought into a world of magical creatures from another world that want him to help get 500,000 guests in 3 months. Can, or will he do it?\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the review!:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nThe story was pretty straightforward, the park in trouble of being shut down, if the goal of 500,000 guests was not reached within 3 months. For the most part, it was pretty episodical, though there was still character and plot development each episode, making the show pretty enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nWow, I have to give credit where it's deserved, the art was absolutely amazing, though the animation was average, the beautiful art made up for the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound was very consistent, the Opening and Ending songs were fantastic, especially the Opening song, it got me pumped up to watch each episode! LOOK AT THE SKY IT'S MAGIC HOUR!! Ahem... Outside of that, the OST was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nNow the characters, while some seemed a little generic, they put a twist on each character to make them unique to the show... and I loved each and every one of them. From the self obsessed MC, socially challenged heroine, to the perverted and hilarious mascots, I truly loved all of them, and the interactions between all the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can I say, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, I found myself laughing at almost every joke and funny moment, and caring what happens to the characters at every point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nCreators of Amagi Brilliant Park, Bravo! You made a great anime.",

            "content": "The past couple years haven't been so great for KyoAni. It's hard to deny that they've lost the influence and momentum they had back in the mid-to-late 2000's, and their work as of late has largely ranged from mediocrity to the flat-out bad (yes, I'm looking at Kyoukai no Kanata). Most of these issues can be attributed to their weakness in writing drama, which, thankfully, is nearly non-existent in their most recent series, Amaburi. \r\nAmaburi (officially \"Amagi Brilliant Park\", which doesn't roll off the tongue nearly as well) sticks instead to KyoAni's strengths. While it's lacking in drama and shirtless bishounens, as a light-hearted slice-of-lifeabout a group of idiots managing an amusement park, it's well worth a watch. It also has Isuzu, who is maybe, just maybe, one of the most attractive heroines in anime, if hot anime ladies is your sort of thing. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, anyone potentially interested in the show should be warned that the first episode is by far the worst. In it, the busty heroine (Isuzu) drags the cynical protagonist (Kanie) to the dilapidated amusement park that she manages, in the hopes that the former child actor, who, by the way, has absolutely zero experience in business management, will save the park from ruin. He begrudgingly accepts the offer, of course, and vows to meet the 500,000-visitors-in-four-months deadline so that the park will not be closed. At the end of the episode, Kanie also receives an abrupt kiss and a random superpower (which is not shown or mentioned again until several episodes later), because, uh, reasons?\\n\\n\r\nTell me if this sounds at all familiar, because I've seen hundreds of anime which have started off in the exact same way. I almost dropped Amaburi right there, and I'm glad I didn't, as it quickly shows it has little interest in being a serious story. Instead, it treats alcoholic, talking animals and magical powers as being completely ordinary. There's even a group of pirate walruses and a bloody dragon. Amaburi fully embraces its silly fantasy setting and cares not for realism. \\n\\n\r\nBut a cost of this silliness is that the show spends more time on the animals and park mascots than it does the human characters. And the mascots (who wear their costumes so frequently that they must be fused to their body) are nowhere near as interesting as Kanie or Isuzu, considering that many of them are based on a single trope. There's an otaku masquerading as some sort of squirrel-thing, an easily-angered shark who turns into a hell-demon when doused in water, a sheep who acts like a street thug, and so on and so forth. Sure, these characters add a great deal of energy to the show and make the park feel more alive, but after their second or third appearance, it's not likely you will appreciate their presence all too much. A few of them even show up dozens of times, and by that point it feels like the show is stretching its jokes way too thin. Granted, though, the commercial scene in the final episode is pretty damn hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nMoffle is perhaps the one mascot who is treated as an actual character and not a running gag. He is introduced as some sort of asshole who punches his own customers when they throw a few bad words his way, and really, he's just an unlikeable jerk towards Kanie until the two start to accept each other's existence. But the reason he is a jerk makes sense: he doesn't want ruffians and other undesirables bringing danger to the park's princess, Latifa, so he plays the role of the jerk in order to protect her. It's hard not to warm up to the little guy by the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Latifa, she just sort of... exists. Latifa and the park are the two main focuses of the story, except she's absent in everything that occurs in the park and is only ever relevant in the first and final episodes. She's there solely as a catalyst for drama, which means her scenes are, unsurprisingly, the weakest in the show. At least she stands there and looks pretty sometimes, I guess? \\n\\n\r\nKanie and Isuzu are far more interesting. On the surface, they're both very typical KyoAni characters (the Kyon-like protagonist who sighs and reluctantly does everything, and the big-breasted kuudere prone to hurting things), but there is at least a little bit of depth to their character. Kanie's reasons for quitting his role as a child actor is explained in one short scene, and so too is Isuzu's reason for constantly shooting people with her musket (though why a minor can legally carry a gun to school remains a mystery). The scene where their past is explained is actually handled with a surprising amount of maturity: there's no screaming and crying, no childhood trauma-- the two just accept it and move on with their lives as people normally would. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the fact that the two are high school kids and yet somehow able to run a massive multi-million dollar business on their own is inexcusable nonsense. I'm sorry, but 16-year-olds are nowhere near experienced enough to tackle such a huge responsibility. This is especially evident when Kanie makes asinine decisions like charging only 30yen (equivalent to 30 cents) for park admission, with all the rides being free of charge, as if this wouldn't immediately drive the park to ruin with an insurmountable amount of debt. Isuzu also occasionally shows up wearing an office lady outfit, and I couldn't help but groan every single time. If you want to write adult characters then, please, just bloody write them. It's not like it's particularly difficult to make the characters a few years older-- say, 19 or 20-- rather than forcing them to be high school students when it makes absolutely zero sense in the context of the story. It's like KyoAni is deathly afraid of writing characters past the age of seventeen (perhaps they think their fans will set fire to their studio if they dare try). I'm getting very tired of it. The world does exist outside the confines of high school. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is about what you would expect from any KyoAni anime, which is to say that it looks great. The sound is much more noteworthy as it is what gives the show the majority of its energy. There's a ton of classy jazz music playing in the background, and the OP is the sort of thing that will get stuck in your brain immediately after hearing it for the first time. I spent a few of my college classes with \"MAGIC HEART\" screaming in my head and it was both delightful and horrifying. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to get rid of the feeling that Amaburi is one long prologue to what will probably be a second season. There's subtle hints of romance between Kanie and Isuzu-- the kind that KyoAni loves to expand upon-- and the story abruptly ends with a light-hearted episode that would normally have been stuck in as an OVA. There's a lot of potential for the second season to be superior to the first, and if KyoAni doesn't create one I would be very surprised. And perhaps a little disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAmaburi is best approached with minimal expectations. If you're expecting another big hit from KyoAni, then Amaburi is certainly not going to be that. If you're OK with just having a few laughs at silly nonsense (and if you're a guy, a few erections from Isuzu's scenes), then you'll probably enjoy your time with the show. It's not a great anime, perhaps not even a good one, but there's more than enough enjoyable content in here to warrant a watch. If nothing else, at least it's not Kyoukai no Kanata.",

            "content": "Amagi Brilliant Park has been making waves in the anime community this season, and it's easy to see why. An intriguingly goofy premise coupled with the fact that it's a Kyoto Animation production sets up rather high expectations. And I have to say, Amagi Brilliant Park exceeded my expectations in nearly every way.\r\nTo say that Amaburi is absurd would be an understatement. Kanie Seiya, a high school student, is tasked with reviving a failing amusement park and has three months to reach its yearly quota of 500,000 guests or the park will shut down. Also, this park is inhabited by magical beings from a differentrealm who rely on the fun that visitors have for their livelihood. Add the fact that the two lead characters are named after Kanye West and 50 Cent--how can you resist?\\n\\n\r\nAmaburi does well with its plot, but that's not where its true strength lies. At its core, Amaburi is built on its characters. Absurd, zany, and above all, lovable, the ensemble of characters contained within the park will win you over instantly. I'm amazed at how much character development they managed to fit into 13 episodes (12 really--the last episode is just a filler). Amaburi really makes you feel the characters' emotions and their motivation to keep their park open. It's been a while since I've been this engaged by a show's characters alone. The hilarious trio of mascots, the dysfunctional dance group, Sento's insecurities despite her stoic appearance, and an arrogant, narcissistic, but ultimately big-hearted main character, as well as a plethora of other wild characters leave a lasting impact.\\n\\n\r\nHuge props to the art direction team on this one. Amaburi looks absolutely stunning. The various areas of the park are bright and colorful, the characters are dynamic, and Amaburi features some of the most hysterical facial expressions I've ever seen. A great job is done with character designs (whoever designed Sento, I cannot thank you enough--you have done humanity a great favor). Appearances aren't everything, but in this department Amaburi sure has it all.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I hardly have anything negative to say at all regarding this series. A great job of managing pacing gives it a full, complete feel despite its short length. By the story's conclusion, it's clear that Amagi Brilliant Park is more than just a goofy comedy. It's about more than just a high school kid running a magical theme park. It evokes feelings of community, friendship, and overcoming adversity that, while they may be corny, ring loud and true. Amagi Brilliant Park is far more heartwarming than its premise suggests. This is the feel-good show of the year.\\n\\n",

            "content": "LOOK AT THE SKY IT'S MAGIC HOUR.\r\nActually, it's half an hour in one episode, but you'll get the joke soon.\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is just spectacular. Some of the audience loved it, and I think it's a chance that Kyoto Animation (KyoAni) has actually redeemed themselves over the troubles they had over the past year. Watching the first episode got me hooked since it has an interesting setting to look forward. You surely have seen amusement parks in a lot of anime, but that's just depicting the characters' enjoyment. But, I'm sure you have yet to see behind the scenes of the park's operation.\r\nThe story startswith Sento inviting Kanie to go with her to an unknown location which is Amagi Brilliant Park. Kanie wasn't pleased with the tour from Sento of the amusement park which is bad in shape and unsatisfactory. Later on, Sento introduced Latifa who then wants Kanie to become the next manager of the park and save it from being taken away. Also, this amusement park isn't just any ordinary park. Kanie learnt that it is occupied by 'fairies' from Maple Land, a magical place far from reality.\\n\\n\r\nBefore you are worried about KyoAni's antics, don't worry. To spoil a bit about the story, it wasn't written in a way which later it is plagued with problematic tropes. Basically throughout the whole anime, you see how Kanie is able to handle the park as the manager. He gets to learn more about the park, its attractions and the workers along the way and from there, he finds ways to improve the well-being. The anime is mostly comedic, meaning lots of moments to laugh at from episode to episode. I would say that it wasn't repetitive, making those moments unique in a sense. There are some dramatic moments which honestly, I feel that they are a bit forced and out of place from the prominent hilarious comedy. But not to fret, they don't really mess up the story much, since then the characters involved got back to their feet. There are also undeveloped romance in some relationships, but it's sweet to see some hints coming about.\\n\r\nWhat I absolutely love about the story is how the park manages to develop, thanks to Kanie's direction as a manager. The workers might be negative over his choices of attracting visitors to the park, and you may be astonished too, but he managed them. The story may also not show this result, but it also drop hints too. Overall, I think the story was almost original and doesn't not have a lot of faults. Of course, many more topics in the story can be expanded, but out of thirteen episodes, I think it's a job well done for the script-writers. There is also some fan-service included that doesn't exceed too much, but you know, it's quite astonishing for KyoAni to add some. Sure, Free! is another anime with a lot of fan-service, but ignoring that anime, it is still a nice shock.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a huge cast which is quite diverse in terms of personality. How the story introduces the characters one by one is fine, since Kanie meets a few workers in the park from episode to episode. Some of the characters have a small story behind them. But what is really good about the cast is that they are never forgotten. Once they are introduced, they will eventually pop up in the next episodes. So if you have your favourite character inside, don't feel left out.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the story do focus on some of the characters. While Kanie manages the park, Sento assists him in some ways. There is some development between the two, but not very much to the point it gets romantic. Indeed, both of them have their own faults which can cause hilarity or not, given the situation they face. They are definitely different on each other in attitude-wise, but they understand each other. However, Latifah doesn't feel like as a main character but more of a plot device to make the story more dramatic. Not much interaction is seen from her, even many of the characters that don't have a larger role get more air time than her. Also, there's the three mascots, Moffle, Macaron and Tiramie, and the four Elementario fairies, Muse, Sylphy, Kobori and Salama. While the mascots serve more as a comedy piece of the story, the Elementario fairies get more development and story. It isn't really consistent but there's one episode that show more about themselves and it's great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the development is okay but not too great. More can be shown not only to Kanie and Sento alone, but also to Latifah and the rest. But given the thirteen-episode limit, it couldn't be helped anyway.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing KyoAni's anime already, I shouldn't be disappointed by its pleasing art style for this anime. The sceneries were definitely eye-grabbing, along with the details in them, the vibrant colours chosen and the lively atmosphere portrayed by the background characters. There are a lot of visual effects shown which are great, such as magical sparkles or the rustling of leaves. You've already seen it quite a lot if you watched a lot of KyoAni anime, so it shouldn't really be a surprise, yet it is so awesome. The character designs were not really original, given that the face styles are similar to other characters from KyoAni's anime. But they are detailed and nice-looking. Some of the non-human designs are definitely cool for some, wacky for the rest. The facial expressions are well-done, and I definitely love the cartoon-ish ones to express hilarity.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song, sang by AKINO with her band, has won the hearts of many with the catchy beats and groovy tunes. It's easily one of the best songs heard in this season, since it attracted a lot of attention. See that starting quote? That's the first quote in the lyrics. It's too famous indeed. I actually looped the song many times. It has a nice feel that relates to the context of the story, giving the hype for the story and the lively feel in it. The ending song is different-sounding. Sang by the voice actresses of the Elementario fairies, it is supposed to have a more calm approach. You may feel that it doesn't really match the context, but you'll get used to it. If I put it aside, it's not a bad song and it's nice. The background music is not really noticeable, but I quite like the style of it. The OST album has been released, and a quick run-through has got me interested. The voice acting is great too. Some voice actors are well-known, the rest are either new or does not have many roles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really loved the anime so much. Ignoring what has been giving the negative impressions of the anime, it's pretty much one of the best anime I've watched this season. A seemingly-interesting story and a diverse cast will not disappoint you definitely. To summarise this anime, it has great comedy from the characters and a good development of the park, thanks to a narcissist manager and an emotionless assistant. Of course, the thirteen episode feels more like an OVA than an actual episode. It still continues from the previous episode indeed, but honestly they can just stop airing at the twelfth episode.",

            "content": "Once every season, Kyoto Animation shows up and grabs the immediate attention of the entire otaku populous after announcing whatever they've been up to the past few months. Being one of the biggest and most successful animation companies in Japan, people tend to automatically just chalk down whatever they license and eagerly await it, expecting something great. But does KyoAni succeed with their latest addition, Amagi Brilliant Park? Can they truly amount to more than just their wonderfully crafted artwork?\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park (Or Amaburi for short) follows Kanie Seiya, a narcissistic and self-centered (Wait. Kanie...Kanye...I see what you did there, KyoAni) high school student andformer child-star, as he is recruited as the new manager for a failing theme park. However, this theme park is currently owned and operated by a group of people that come from the magical world of \"Maple Land\". The women are beautiful and the males all look like mascots for college football teams, which is personally my ideal picture of a magic kingdom.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the story seems a little odd, it does quickly become alluring when you find out the princess of Maple Land and former manager of the park has a sickness that prevents her from aging and resets her memory once every year. And so Kanye West Seiya must bring in a total of 500,000 visitors in a six month period in order for the Maple Landers to keep the park. If he does not succeed, Princess Frailty will lose her magic powers contained within the park and ultimately die a tragic death.\\n\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park has its ups and downs (LIKE A ROLLER COASTER. HA) but it isn't by any means bad. I found myself looking forward to it every week, just as I normally do with Kyoto Animation's stuff. But this time I didn't have to fully invest myself in the story like I had to do with sthows like Hyouka, which worked on solving mysteries and building up relationships. So, lets delve deeper as I once again break this show apart, piece by piece, to better illustrate how I feel about it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nJust like every other normal person in the world, I love clapping. The opening song to Amagi Brilliant Park utilizes clapping. Twice. That's cool, I like that. And since Kyoto Animation created the opening, the clapping looks sweet. But I digress. The anime sounds just like you'd expect a show about a theme park to sound. The music is lively and cheerful, and at the same time it delivers hope. And with Amaburi's story, that is absolutely vital. Background music isn't repetitious at all and plays an essential part in making each scene seem full. But because the music wasn't outstanding and didn't play a part in changing the way people viewed the show, it wasn't perfect and definitely could have been improved upon.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, Amaburi has a solid line-up. Kanie is quite different from the dense male leads you'll often find in anime today, and the rest of the cast is pretty solid as well. Sento Isuzu (Whose name I just found out comes from 50 Cent) does a great job in supporting Kanie's character throughout the duration of the show. And all of the mascot-men are there with extremely strong personalities to provide sufficient comic relief for the theme park. The thing is, even though the characters were very original and unique all across the board, the majority of them were ONLY there to serve as that comic relief I mentioned. It's great to be funny, but if that's your only personality trait in real life, you're probably going to have a hard time and you aren't a perfect character. I would have liked to see some more development in anyone apart from the leads, but it just didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis was probably a given as soon as Kyoto Animation's name was put under the title, but Amagi Brilliant Park delivers some of the best artwork this year. Character designs were outrageous and easily memorable, and the theme park as a whole, even when it was decaying, was a sight for sore eyes. It's refreshing to see KyoAni constantly improving and not just taking advantage of their position in the industry and settling down in a \"safe spot\". They are constantly pushing themselves to create something better, and it has been succeeding. As a reference point, please direct your attention to the Ferris wheel above. Isn't that the best damn Ferris wheel you've ever seen in an anime? You're damn right it is. Amaburi has zero issues when it comes to appearance, and that is vital in keeping the audience's interest locked in.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 \\n\r\nWhat's disappointing about the story line of this show is that they throw in a lot of information that seems like it's important, but is never mentioned again. The viewers never find out what exactly happened to cause Kanie's fallout of the entertainment industry. Sento's affections never get let out and ultimately become meaningless when you look at the bigger picture. And then Kanie goes off on this rant about how he is terrified of heights and wants to hide it from everyone but it plays no part in determining how you look at the story. And then there was the whole thing with how Kanie somehow ran into the princess when he was a child and now felt like he was destined to save her life. It just started to seem forced, like the writers wanted there to be a story when in all actuality the show was just there to be fun. The idea was good, but countless attempts to make it deeper than it should have been really ruined its legitimacy.\\n\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is a solid show, but it could have been much better. You'll find that the driving force in bringing you back to the next episode falls completely on the characters and artwork. It's definitely enjoyable, but one of the weaker shows KyoAni has brought forth in recent years, which may be a direct result of them setting the bar too high for themselves. Watch this if you are either an avid fan of the studio or just looking to have a few laughs and wind down. There are better options out there, but Amaburi will suffice if you don't want to look for them.",

            "content": "What exactly is Amagi Brilliant Park? On the basic surface, it isn\u2019t exactly brilliant with its host of generic characters. However, taking a closer glance at the show might make you think differently once you\u2019re on board with its ideas. Don\u2019t get me wrong though. Amagi Brilliant Park isn\u2019t exactly a show for everyone but it does launches itself into a realm of its own that has a unique ability to keep the audience at their seats.\r\nAdapted by the light novel of the same name, this anime series covers the first book with a bit of expansion. There are also several interesting noteworthy attributes totake into consideration about this adaptation. First, the series is written by Shoji Gatoh who is well known for his work, Full Metal Panic. Then, there\u2019s the studio in charge known as Kyoto Animation. While the studio needs little introduction, one should take notice a history of its works and realize this show is one of the first they\u2019ve done relating to such a gimmick. Rather than taking place in some school setting, the series take place in a place of modern fantasy known as the Amagi Brilliant Park.\\n\\n\r\nA fresh concept. This show can seem a bit strange at times. The first episode blasts off without wasting any time by introducing the two main protagonists \u2013 Seiya Kanie and Isuzu Sento. The oddball circumstance involves Sento going on a \u2018date\u2019 with Kanie but only then does he realize that their fun time turns into something else. As such, the show initially introduces the basic mechanics of Amagi Brilliant Park. It establishes the premise and lets the audience know what it\u2019s about, a task done quite well with the mechanics. But when it comes to characters, the show swings in a bit of an odd direction. For instance, it\u2019s easy to tell that Kanie and Sento are quite different. Kanie has a narcissist attitude with a full of confidence and pride. While on the other hand, Sento is much more stoic who shows little emotions despite her sensitive personality. When you put these two characters together as the main duo, there\u2019s a problem with compatibility. Nonetheless, the show does seize opportunities to bring the best out of them. \\n\\n\r\nIt does this often by appealing at the ideas of the show. To do this, almost every character that Kanie or Sento gets involved with plays a form of role in bringing in new customers. Because let\u2019s face it, the goal of the series is to attract 250,000 visitors to the park and if not done in 3 months will lead to closure. The show makes it clear that if the park closes, then it would seize to exist at all (literally) in the human world. This is because of the staff of the park is made of beings from another realm known as the Maple World. And for the park to function, it needs to harvest magical energy from visitors who are having fun. Simply put: no visitors, no energy, no park. The show also makes it clear that Kanie has experience in the entertainment industry early on thanks to flashbacks and his own experiences. As such, expect Kanie to bring in ideas from what he has learned to ensure that Amagi Brilliant Park reaches its goal. \\n\\n\r\nAs a show with many possibilities, most of it consists of the characters. There\u2019s a wide diversity of them whether it\u2019s a princess like Latifah Fleuranza, fairy mascots such as Moffle, the Elementario girls, or other members hired by the staff. The series gives them a variety of roles although their key purpose is to bring entertainment so that visitors come by. To say the least though, the show accomplishes its task of entertainment with the personalities of the characters. Almost all of them brings in some form of fun to the series even when timings feel off or the amount of generic concepts used. It also seems as if the show is self-aware at times because even some of the character names are originated from popular icons from the real life world. The key element to take into consideration is still entertainment as the show tries a different set of dynamics each episode. These involve the different attractions at the park such as Indiana Jones style adventures, Water Park (complete with pirates and the ship), trials and error with idol themes, or secret cave with a mythic dragon. There are still repetitive gimmicks used though such as Moffle\u2019s fury (which is resulted from his endless rivalry with Kanie), Sento\u2019s gun (that often strikes fear into almost anyone that comes near it including Kanie), or the variety of species used to bring in diversity. As such, a show such as this offers almost something for anyone when it comes to the characters. Unfortunately, characterization suffers and in fact almost non-existent. Except perhaps the princess, Sento, or Kanie, none of the other characters get background stories or development. It also seems like the show plays off of stereotypes and make certain characters (ex. Elementario girls) seem like a joke with little more than pure eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being written by the author of FMP, don\u2019t expect much similarities to it. There\u2019s no psychological scenarios or plots about the military. Instead, see this series like a showbiz. And to deliver that, the show needs to inspire comedy. While I think the series is on the right track, it occasionally tries far too hard to appeal in such a way at times. Comedy is repetitive and feels slipping away at times. There are some serious moments but some of the awkward timings feels off. However, a few of the characters are memorable for their personalities especially Kanie during key moments. One of his earlier speeches shows exactly the type of person he is despite putting on his poker face. While starving for ideas, the show does also finds ways to create opportunities to explore every aspect of its attractions through either internal or external conflict. These even include hiring new staff members, dealing with the past, and even events outside of the park. However, the endgame could be a mixed bag because like I mentioned before, this series is not for everyone. The finale of the episode also feels OVA-ish.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to visuals, Amagi Brilliant Park\u2019s technical quality nails it with its high production values thanks to Kyoto Animation. While landscapes aren\u2019t lavishly on Makoto Shinkai levels, it does have creativity ideas behind it. However, the character designs feels childish. In particular, the mascots looks like furry animals while the Elementario girls almost gives off the feeling that they are teenagers on the way to a Halloween costume party. Did I also mention fan service? The first episode has a full glimpse of that while subsequent episodes does this with bikini outfits and pirate gear. Luckily enough, the show doesn\u2019t make this as its main attraction but rather just as part of its gimmick. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack plays a few key roles. To say the least, the OP song is very catchy not just with the lyrics but by the energy it crafts with almost every character being featured; and in some moments clapping hands in unison. I also give some credit for Kanie\u2019s voice for his ability to really demonstrate his character as a perfectionist. His speeches may sometimes feel laggy but they are to the point with brutal honesty and narcissism. Other characters such as Latifah brings in a gentle atmosphere with her voice while Moffle does the exact opposite of that. However, the OST is easily forgettable even during some emotional scenes of sentimentality. \\n\\n\r\nOddly, Amagi Brilliant Park feels like an entertainment showbiz itself. The story offers a variety of ideas although it does falter whenever it tries a bit more than it should have. There is almost an ensemble like cast of characters that the audience may find attached to. Just be aware that these characters play roles like pieces to a puzzle rather than getting depth on their own. For all its technical wizardry, the show is still very much about a guy trying to do his best to save a park that definitely needs to be saved. Fans of other Kyoto Animation works may find this a bit different than what they are used to. It\u2019s not just the different main setting but also because this show plays around with itself like a roller coaster on steroids. \\n",

            "content": "Summary: Amagi Brilliant Park is a enjoyable anime if you would like to see the MC and his friend build up towards their goals. It has an alright style of conveying the characters emotions, although it has unfinished romance between some of the characters which i don't like happening in anime I watch.\r\nStory: The plot for Amagi Brilliant Park is certainly original. I haven't seen any other anime with this plot and it makes for a good change. Although they do explain why they have to run the park, I would have liked more detail in that aspect. The originality makes up for it though.8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Amagi Brilliant park catches the eye with it's style of characters. Recently there has been a development in art since the release of 1080p resolution. Well, I guess that isn't recent, but you get the point. This anime uses the new style of art - and well. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack isn't something amazing, but it suits the anime well. It makes for some emotional scenes even though most of the anime is a casual watch, and is not one of the anime that gives the feels for me. The voice actors perform well in this anime and suits what you think the character would sound like. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The main character is a bit generic, but is one of those \"never give up\" characters, which suits the anime. For me the backstories could have been told in more detail, but that is not much of a problem. Overall the characters were good. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Although I did enjoy this anime my overall opinion is mixed. I loved the art but the only downside was I would have liked more character development, although the characters were thought out well. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n",

            "content": "A carnival setting in anime, is new for me, so going into this show I didn't know what to expect, it looked colorful and bright and there was a huge cast so I had a feeling it was gonna be right up my ally. As I started my rollercoaster expecting something pretty good and maybe amazing, by the end of the rollercoaster, I just had a smile on my face, It wasn't the best ride of my life it was just good. I could sum up Amagi Brilliant Park in just that sentence itself. But this is a review! That would be too dumbwitted.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThestory here is simple, a park known as Amagi Brilliant Park (hence the name of the show) hasn't been going well, it needs to have 500,000 visitors in just a couple of months, A highschool student has agreed to be manager but only until they get 500.00 visitors by the time limit he shall thou quit. \\n\\n\r\nA straightforward story, now I like stories that are easy to understand, its a sign that the show will be more enjoyable and anyone can watch it. Now when I saw this show had 13 episodes I was afraid this show was gonna be rushed but shockingly its the perfect run time for a show like this, didn't see that coming huh? \\n\\n\r\nI don't have too much to say about the story, its simple and good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty well done here, with some really nice backgrounds and colorful art style it just shines here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nThe music is upbeat and fun. The OP is like a rollercoaster that never stops....until the OP finishes. The ED is Ok for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7/10\\n\r\nFirst we have Saiya. a highschool student who loves himself so much that he denys girls, HA GAY! Well other than that he is a fucking honest and brutal MC, he runs the park like he means it, the creators had balls to make the MC like this compared to other male MCs in modern anime, I give props to that.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Isuzu, Saiya's co-worker, a mindless woman who literally threatens people with some shotgun just to get work done. It seems pretty funny when she stops bad problems using her shotgun. Other than that, she hardly changes throughout the series, by the end of the show she's still the same as the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThere's meant to be some kind of relationship between Isuzu and Saiya, there's lots of potential for character development, but as soon as it can happen in scenes where the two are alone, it just fails to deliver and they're back to root one co-workers. Even in the last episode there's so many chances but the show acts like noting happened.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThis show is episodic for the most part, each episode has its own story and problems and more visitors round up in. It keeps going till the last episode. Now its good this wasn't 24 episodes, cause that would be very repetitive. The comedy in this show is pretty good, there's some chuck-worthy moments and scenes where I was laughing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is a good show that delivers what it can do, it shines in its art and sound and does fairly well in its story and characters, give this show a go, you'll probably enjoy it. In the end Amagi Brilliant Park was an enjoyable rollercoaster that'll leave you with a smile on your face.",

            "content": "When I heard of this anime I thought the concept sounded ridiculous. A highschool boy becomes the manager of a magical theme park in an attempt to save its workers from doom. To be honest, it is ridiculous. There's no way around that. Luckily, this anime is so fun and entertaining that it's easy to forget how stupid it should be.\r\nThe characters help this aspect a lot. All of the main characters get ample development, and a lot of the side characters as well. This helps pull the anime through some of its sillier scenes, and lends weight to what should be cheesy dramatic momentssprinkled here and there. \\n\\n\r\nBoth the animation and sound are spectacular. There are many memorable bgms, and the opening song is a good way to get fired up for the next episode. The animations and art are precise and colorful, with some surprising flair to be found every once in awhile.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of comedies. You could even refer to me as a killjoy. However, this anime made me laugh more often than not. There were some comedic misses here and there, but if something can make you laugh even once, then it succeeds as a comedy. Together with some pleasantly heartwarming scenes and endearing characters, this anime manages to avoid the trainwreck it so easily could have been. Worth a watch if you are in the mood for a light, funny, heartfelt dramedy.",

            "content": "To be honest, I only considered watching Amagi Brilliant Park because it's Kyoto Animation. But what kept me watching is my love for theme parks.\r\nI really thought Amaburi would be an exposition, showing its viewers true-to-life behind the scenes and nitty-gritty aspects of a particular object (in this case, a theme park) - something like Shirobako with anime making - plus an added fantasy in the side. I suppose it is that kind of anime in its own way. Only, most of the elements you encounter are improbable. It's a fantasy anime, no doubt about it.\r\nAmaburi's art is its most dazzling feat. It's nothing lessfrom KyoAni. Its visuals are colorful, vibrant, and fluid befitting that of a theme park. KyoAni hasn't innovated its character design that much but it still packs a punch in Amaburi. Kanie's, for example, can put the Iwatobi boys' to shame.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the series suffers the most is the story. The first two episodes give us a trajectory. The setting may be cliche in its execution but it gave us a clear goal.\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, the succeeding episodes are loaded with filler stories that may or may not make sense and only give the slightest intent of ever reaching that goal. They may give us an inkling of what is needed to run a theme park but they're nothing more than run-of-the-mill antics with a touch of the improbable. I honestly think KyoAni could have done a better job if they put a little more thought and effort in building the fillers.\\n\\n\r\nThe overarching story is put back in focus in the last five episodes. The series manages to save itself as it slowly unfolds a cute, charming little story amusing enough to keep me watching until the last episode. It is the biggest plus side after that mess of a middle. Save for a few plot holes and open-endings, I can say that Amaburi ended well enough.\\n\\n\r\nWith its characterization, Amaburi keeps it simple. But with its diversity of characters, development was disordered. For some characters, you'll see them grow as the series progresses and for the others, there is almost no development at all.\\n\\n\r\nIt hits most of what we can expect from an effort by KyoAni - consistent visuals, top-notch character design, and a whole lot of fan service. After Free! and Kyoukai no Kanata, I would have asked for more. But with its variety of scenes, AmaBuri proves how versatile the studio is.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Amagi Brilliant Park is a roller coaster ride. It takes you up and down and through the unexpected and ends abruptly enough for you to want more. It may not be the best of what KyoAni has to offer but it is a good addition to their opus. I would recommend this to anyone looking for lighthearted entertainment.",

The story was well set up and introduced with easy to recognise and interesting characters. the first 4/5 episodes are related to the over-arching story of needing guests with a few \"character helping\" episodes in between before finishing the main story. i normally hate this format as it means my fat 300lb ass has to sit through more aneemay and spend less time shaking hands with my man downstairs but it was very enjoyable, each episode had itsown charm and interesting conflict, i was never once bored watching this show. it was well combined humour and character/plot development. at 12 episodes long, it did well to tell a good story with a decent level of depth in an entertaining manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest point of this show by far was the characters. I dont think ive ever liked a set of characters as much as this set. \\n\r\n  The main character in particular was one of the most \"normal\" well rounded characters ive seen. It pisses me off when the main characters of typical shows get all shy when talking to girls, shy when bikini/sex related stuff comes up and just tries to be a goody two shoes in general. He was real, he did things to piss people off, he played the bad guy, he could actually hold a conversation with an attractive girl (much like me irl m'lady *tips federer* (yes i am single. my number is 6942042069)) he wasnt over exaggerated and did shit done without being too personal about it. No i am not homo for this guy but he was funny, had a complex and has a great bum. \\n\r\n  the supporting cast was also well constructed with sufficient development to the extent that i could enjoy every appearance. the three bunnies in the costume were particularly hilarious. their male urges displayed by such a cute and innocent exterior was refreshing to say the least and very all around entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nThere wasnt much i didnt like about the show. The power thing that he gets is rarely used and is almost unnecessary to the point i forgot, on multiple occasions, he even had it. I felt the teaser you get for the next episode is pretty redundant and of course i wanted the main character to fulfil my dreams of tipping all the federers in the world towards the general direction of sento isuzu aka nicetitty-would-let-her-dominate-me-with-whipped-cream-and-dongers gun girl. it is no secret that fat carlton on MAL is a romcom lover and i ship the fuck out of those two like the titanic and the bottom of the atlantic.\\n\\n\r\nIts just a short fun anime with a simple story and good characters that is fun, entertaining and funny for all ages.",

            "content": "Ah, amusement parks.  Disney world, Six Flags, Oceanworld, Japan's DisneySea, we all have wonderful, wonderful memories in them with our families and friends.  But have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes?  (Probably not)  But thankfully, Amagi Brilliant Park gives us this answer in a very nicely done comedic sense.\r\nStory (7.33/10):  Held against a wall against his will, Kanie Seiya is threatened with his life by a girl at his school by the name of Isuzu Sento, who is holding him by gunpoint.  After being asked (more like forced) to go on a date with her to anamusement park, he reluctantly goes, before seeing the poor, poor state that Amagi Brilliant Park is in.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story of Amagi follows a rather simple plot line.  As being appointed as the manager of the park, the story follows Kanie as he attempts to make up ways to build up Amagi's popularity and visitor count, thinking of a new harebrained scheme each episode in order to do it.  In addition with this plot line, the show builds up its character count by adding in more and more side characters as the story goes from episode to episode.  The plot line does work very well for the series and does a great deal of positive things for it, however, there are a couple things that do bring the series down a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOne of bigger flaws for the series is character development.  For the main three characters: Kanie, Sento, and Latifa, the show gives each of them a bit of a backstory for each of them, explaining a little bit about their character and why they are the way they are.  The only problem with this is due to how little it is.  The show is good in its characters because they're interesting.  The backstories are genuinely interesting.  However, it was a bit disappointing seeing that the characters didn't get as much development as they could've because I would've liked to see more of what what made them into what they are.\\n\\n\r\nStill though, the story overall was good to watch.  The comedy was decently done and the general pacing of the show was good.  Personally, I found myself enjoying the show a lot and looked forward to every episode.  Every episode except the last one was good.  The only reason why the last one felt bad was because it felt REALLY out of place.  I personally would've put it a 1 or 2 episodes back before the last one because it didn't really make sense to put it as the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good story\\n\r\n+  Good comedy\\n\r\n+  Good pacing\\n\r\n-   Not enough character development\\n\r\n-   Out of place last episode\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.61/10):  The characters for Amagi were definitely a very interesting and memorable bunch to watch.  I can guarantee that these characters will stick in your head long after you've finished the series.\\n\\n\r\nKanie Seiya is the main protagonist of the series.  Kanie is a self-proclaimed genius, thinking of himself that he's good-looking and the center of the world.  (His character is named after Kanye West.  No surprise his character reflects it.)  As a previous child star, Kanie has knowledge over what makes things popular and makes uses of that expertise as a way to make Amagi more popular and appealing to the public.  As the series goes on, you can see Kanie grow as a character as he puts in his time and effort into the Park.  The development is really nice to see and really shows how development can be put into any series.  As a downside however, his character isn't really explored beyond how he's a child star.  They don't explain why he got out of it, or why he went into it into the first place, which really was a downer considering how much more it could've added to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Isuzu Sento, the Kuudere secretary to Kanie.  Sento is a very interesting character because she doesn't really have much on the surface, but she really becomes a memorable character.  Her backstory doesn't really extend beyond the fact that she's a guard, which is also really disappointing because you don't really get to know very much.  Her most defining characteristic is her gun, which apparently, she can pull out of any exposed skin, which makes for some decent character moments.  Beyond that, as well as her lack of understanding situations, she doesn't get very much.  Regardless though, she is still quite a memorable character and does make for a nice secondary main character.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to these two, there are the other characters which I would consider to be main characters, those characters being Latifa, Moffle, Tiramie, and Macaron.  The first one being the other main character, the other three being the three drunk stooges of the series.  Let's start with Latifa.  Latifa is what I would consider to be an underused character.  In the series, she's not really made out to be a prominent character, but more like an important character that doesn't show up much kind of character.  She doesn't have a very large presence in the series overall, and mostly only gets proper screentime and plot importance later on.  She has a decent enough backstory to support her character, but I really wish we could get a little bit more from her timewise because she was an adored character that we don't really get to see.  The other three I mentioned play as a sort of comedy trio, being somewhat essential to the plot by being the park's main three mascots, creating comedy moments and sometimes conflict, along the way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the series does have lacking as well were some proper character usage.  Most notably, the four elementario fairies.  Personally, I would've liked to see Sylphid, Muse, Kobiri, and Salama have a lot more screentime in the series.  The series went to the effort of devoting the ending song to these four, making them the star of it, which really didn't reflect on how they were treated in the series since they really only got one episode to devote to them, making them just as important as all the other side characters in the series.  Amagi made them look more important than they actually were, so that was a bit disappointing to see.\\n\\n\r\nApart from them, we have side characters, a lot of them.  in every single episode, the series introduces new members of the park, both new ones and ones we haven't met, adding to the ever expanding cast.  What makes these supporting cast members somewhat memorable is both their design, and how they make use of their small bits of screentime.  (But mostly their appearance)  They make the park seem populated with workers, and that's really about all they do.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Memorable cast\\n\r\n+  Interesting main characters\\n\r\n+/-  Unfinished character development\\n\r\n-  Supporting cast was a bit too expansive and some weren't handled too well\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.08/10):  Amagi was produced by Kyoto Animation, the same studio that did Haruhi and Lucky Star.  The animation for Amagi does look very high quality.  The colors for the show are very bright-looking, giving off that storybook/fairytale kind of feel due to how primary and light all the characters look.  In addition, the characters look rather simple.  There's not an absurd amount of decoration in them, but they look very pleasing to the eye.  All in all, the art is definitely fantastic to look at.  It's nice and simple, crafted very nicely, but it isn't particularly standout in comparison to other shows.  (That being said, we do have this show to thank for the phrase \"Kyo-Ani Butt\")\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, the show boasts a good duo of opening and ending songs with each of them serving different purposes.  The opening sort of gives off the tone of what you can expect when watching Amagi, starting with a wind-up music box tone before showering you with chords, saying that you're not watching a fairy tale, this is real, and it's fantastic.  In contrast, the ending does the opposite, giving off a whimsical tone and sound as it sings about the elemntario fairies and the four elements that they \"control\" (since they can barely summon water, wind, earth, or fire.)  The ending may or may not stick to your head, but the opening surely can.  (Just listen to the first 10 seconds if you don't know what I'm talking about.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good art  \\n\r\n+  Memorable music\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.33/10):  Kyo-Ani has been a good studio for me to watch from.  The stuff that they produce appeals to me and gives me a sense of enjoyment.  This show was no different.  When I found the concept of an amusement park being an anime setting, I thought to myself, \"Ok, what kind of shit are they going to make here?\", cause anime has decent comedy from a lot of different settings.  (such as high school, working at a family restaurant, and even about buying from a supermarket for god's sakes.)  When I watched the show, I was pleasantly surprised, keeping at it because this was a show I genuinely enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I did.  The show did keep me intrigued by switching the focus from one part of the park to another, keeping the show fresh with new side characters in order to give the audience a new experience.  In addition, the show did add character growth to its main protagonist, which was a nice plus for the series.  Also, the freaking fairies in this series drink beer.  Have you ever seen a violent mouse with a hat, a perverted pink cat, and a dissatisfied sheep guzzle a couple pints like it was their life?  Thought so.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nWell, aside from the horrendously out of place final episode, the show didn't really make use of the backstories that it had set for some of its characters.  We don't really get to know why Kanie quit his child star career, or why that last-minute protagonist did what he did, or even like the future of Amagi.  Cause I really want to know what happens afterwords.  The main characters didn't get I feel, enough of a backstory.  They feel incomplete, and I wish we could get just a little bit more bang for our 30 yen entry fee.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, yes, I would.  It's a great little comedy series that doesn't really take itself too seriously.  It's a nice comedy show that provides some very memorable characters, and even a few choice moments that are actually quite memorable.  While the character development is a bit lacking in that department, and the large amount of side characters may or may not be distracting, Amagi Brilliant Park is a nice place to visit, and I hope you may all visit again.  \\n\\n\r\nP.S.  Salama best girl.  You are free to disagree in my comments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.48/10",

            "content": "\u201cSimply put, we need to go lewder. Miniskirts! Swimsuits! Low-Angle Shots! You need to put in as many of those as you can without breaking the law.\u201d\r\n-Amagi Brilliant Park, Episode 13\r\nAnother season, another project by KyoAni unfolded to the masses. Though it seems as though KyoAni\u2019s latest attempt at trying to appeal to the anime demographic that loves cute and sexy girls is now back in full fashion, I\u2019d think of Amagi Brilliant Park as their apology to all the people who were whining about the \u201cgayness\u201d that KyoAni was ostracizing with their recent hit, \u201cFree!\u201d. Hey, they can make whatever they please, and wecan judge whether it\u2019s worthy of being timeless in their long successful history. In which case Amagi Brilliant Park will only be seen as just another Kyoukai no Kanata; a filler show.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas Kyoukai no Kanata fell vastly short even to be called a memorable show, a filler show at that, Amagi Brilliant Park is at least commendable to be called a filler show. In the strictest sense, what made me make this distinction while watching this show was how appropriately tame it is with how it portrays the story and setting. Everything is lighthearted, for the most part, and easy for the mind to sit back and relax in pure escapism. As with every anime comedy, there are cute girls in it. KyoAni indeed hasn\u2019t failed on giving us quality girls as opposed to other aspects to an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the main characters are fueled by their appearances and personalities that spark up a great deal of charm to their archetypes. Latifa is typically the girly girl part of the cast that is always optimistic and smiling so we can view her innocence and glamour. Not necessarily the best character considering her backstory is quite exaggerated in the most apathetic way possible, but nothing terrible either. However, there is Isuzu. Quite possibly the one saving grace to the show in her hilarious stoic demeanor. Hilarious in the sense that when she breaks character and starts showing emotion, you have no choice but to squeal with ultimate delight. Plus, you can\u2019t be a true man if you refuse her offer to paizuri you.\\n\\n\r\nBesides our two main girls, our male protagonist, Seiya Kanie, isn\u2019t anything special. He doesn\u2019t offer any nuanced grandeur to make him stand out like any other memorable KyoAni protagonists before him. But the real crux of the cast are the supporting cast, and there are a lot of them. The problem with this is how so little of the supporting cast barely have anything to make them seem unique other than just being weird mascot characters that are hardly significant in any way. Sure, some of them, particularly Moffle and Tiramie, have some funny moments, but its a quick little comedic pick me up before it\u2019s later tossed away by another funny moment.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does make Amagi Brilliant Park unique amongst other of KyoAni\u2019s projects is just how vibrant and colorful they\u2019ve made their art and animation. Earlier in KyoAni\u2019s career, they\u2019ve tried to make their characters seem more realistic despite just relying on the moe-blob formula. They\u2019re still present in here, but what makes this refreshing is how they implement the cartoonish aesthetic to the different characters. Besides our human characters, it\u2019s nice to see KyoAni make these adorable animal mascots and give some spark of creativity to how they interact with their bodies and to each other.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing\u2026.oh wait, I forgot about the story. Wait, honestly, what story is there to critique? It\u2019s almost 2nd nature to Amagi Brilliant Park. All there is to service a plot is the characters trying to keep their amusement park from closing down. But the only problem is that they fail even to make that an issue that I should care about since all the fanservice and cute characters drown it out like white noise. Its one of those situations where the show falls flat on story but, then again, that isn\u2019t the whole point, and even the show itself makes this clear as day. When you first show a girl dressed up as a pirate girl in a bikini, your only response is to clap slowly in amusement and go, \u201cYeah okay, I\u2019ll let this be passable in any measure.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s how Amagi Brilliant Park can be described into one word: passable. Just a bit above passable to where it can be labeled decent in the critical spectrum. As far as KyoAni shows, to which I\u2019ve become not fond of even when they were in their \u201cgolden age,\u201d it will nonetheless entertain with enjoyable comedy to splendor about. Sure it\u2019s another show centered around cute girls, but when you see the sight of Isuzu in a cheerleader bikini outfit, it\u2019s a sight that is more than just moe; it\u2019s life.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR - Fun for all ages\r\nWatching Amagi Brilliant Park is refreshing.  You are not watching some kids trying to save the world, or some evil zombie feast, or even (un)popular-guy-loved-by-every-girl-he-talks-to.  Aamgi Brilliant Park is brilliant, entertaining and never fails to amaze.\r\n(MOSTLY) GOOD - Story\r\nThe series quickly established the premise: the run-down Amagi Brilliant Park, owned by a princess from a land of magic, is in dire situation.  Unless it reaches the yearly quota of half a million visitors in the next three months, it faces foreclosure.  The only saviour is in the form of Kanie Seiya, a narcissistic high school studentwho, after much needed coaxing, promised to help out as the park's new manager.\\n\\n\r\nTheme park management is probably the last thing you have in mind when it comes to anime.  It works brilliantly as a game (too many theme park sim game to name here), but as an anime, you might think that it would be a tough nut to crack.  Well, Amaburi gladly proves you wrong.  Amaburi is one of the funniest anime in recent time, and it comes down to the story and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is an adventure.  Being a comedy, one would expect the adventure to turn into something that never goes according to plan.  The comedy hits just the right spot at the right time.  Sometimes it is when you least expected it and sometimes you can see it from miles away.  Each episode is a self-contained story, with the overall arc being played out in the background.  That is, until the last few episodes when it is number crunching time.  That's when the story picks up pace.  Rest assured, the ending is well written (for the most part) without feeling rushed.  In fact, I think the series has good pace overall.\\n\\n\r\nWithout the overarching story of the threat of closure, this anime could go on forever.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I like about this anime is that it does not rely (solely) on ecchi to sell the show.  Sure, you get great fan service (check out those racks on Sento!), but they only tell part of the story.  This show is driven by the humorous writing and great characters.  You would develop feelings for the park as it is transferred from the ICU to the general ward as it can now breathe normally without life support.  But will the park be able to leave the hospital in full health, or will its condition suddenly turn south?  You will have to watch it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Amaburi is not without its problem.  Because each episode is a self-contained story, sometimes it loses track of the overall picture.  Sure, they are great fun to watch.  But it might not actually have anything to do with saving the park.  I feel that some of the episodes could be done as an OVA while the main series should be concentrated on how Kanie uses his (alleged) brilliance to save the park from collapse.\\n\\n\r\nGOOD - Character development\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of characters in Amagi Brilliant Park, but we only get to know a handful of them.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who we do get to see, they are well rounded and full of energy.  Each character has his / her own personality, not your typical cardboard cut-out character.  Kanie Seiya, while being an egoistic teenager, is actually quite caring and loves his job.  Isuzu Sento is a stoic blank face on the surface, but she has a great sense of responsibility and would do anything in her ability to complete her task.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters like the three main mascots and the four elementary fairies are well loved and have a great sense of humour.  Those viewers with keen eyes might recognise the remarkable resemblance between Moffle and Bonta-kun\u2019s from Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu.  And given the nature of FMP? Fumoffu, one could not be faulted for associating Moffle with comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe three mascots in particular (Macaron, Tiramie and Moffle) is a major source of entertainment.  Macaron is divorced and refused to pay child support, Tiramie is really a pervert at heart, and Moffle has a violent tendency.  You really can't judge the book by its cover.\\n\\n\r\nOne strength of the series is letting the characters shine in their own light.  There are episodes where our main characters have little impact on the outcome.  However, this is a double edged sword.  As it stands, letting other characters take the spotlight unfortunately detract the main story line.  A better way would have been letting other characters come up with ways to resolve some of the issues facing the park, rather than the scenarios that ended up in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI would love to see other characters being introduced in the series, but sadly, the anime is too short to fully explore the so many lively characters that is employed in the park.\\n\\n\r\nGOOD - Animation\\n\\n\r\nThe background is colourful and vibrant.  The drawings are crisp, and animation is smooth.  Character design is adequate.  The three main mascots are mascots, so you do not get to see costumes changes.  Other mascots stays the same throughout the series.   Kanie and Isuzu mostly donned the Amaburi uniform, albeit with seasonal variants.  I can count on two hands the number of outfits that Sento wears.\\n\\n\r\nIf fan service is what you are after, there are plenty of that too, though not as much as the creators wanted them to be.  But then again, there is something call the 'internet'.  Some search results might come up quite 'revealing'.\\n\\n\r\nBAD - Not Enough Kanie Magic\\n\\n\r\nI might be nit-picking here, but we have already established in the first episode that Kanie has been gifted with magic that can read minds.  Unfortunately we don't get to see nearly enough instances where his uses magic to his advantage.  We see Isuzu with her guns from you-know-where, I mean, god-knows-where magic trick every second episode, but in the case of Kanie, I think it has potential to make a regular appearance.  Maybe we can get some comedy out of him reading the minds of guests.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nThe eponymous Amagi Brilliant Park is anything but brilliant.  The park is in such disarray that it is a surprise that there are visitor at all.  But through aggressive marketing and the (alleged) brilliance of Kanie's management skills, the park is slowly brought back to life.  The anime is a journey to that end.  Though it sometimes detracts from its main goal, Amaburi managed to stay on track long enough to keep the audience interested.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a great fun to watch, though that are many potential areas that are left untouched.  Hopefully they could be addressed / expand in future seasons.  Every character has his/her own personality that makes the team so different and dynamic.  The OP and ED have the typical JPOP feel, and the music, though not memorable, is quite soothing to listen to.  The animation is marvellous.  Plot is great, entertainment and funny.  If only the series was longer.",

            "content": "Amagi Brilliant Park is a Fantasy, Romantic Comedy anime, where Seiya Kanie is asked to help the park from closing by attracting 250,000 visitors because the staff of the park are from a magical realm called Maple Land and the park is really a facility thats harvests a magical energy form visitors while they are having fun, so they can maintain their existence in the human realm. So as you can see just a normal anime plot, ok really it a really good concept and is very interesting, and i promise the story is really good as they face different situations each episode while tryingto get visitors need to keep the park open. Each episode will surprise, make you laugh and what they do about getting people to come to the park. \\n\r\nNow on to the characters, now i only going to to talk about the main three characters because there is a lot of characters in this anime and i not going too much information about them as the anime does a good job explaining what the characters are like and somethings about main characters are story spoilers. First up is the man himself, Seiya Kanie (Voiced by K\u014dki Uchiyama), He is a high school student that is highly intelligence, excellent reflexes, has a sharp mind and a narcissist. He is asked by Latifah, the princess of Maple Land to become the manager because of being in the entertainment business before. Next is Isuzu Sento (Voiced by Ai Kakuma), is a royal guard to the princess who carries a rife called Steinberger and is the one to get Kanie to go to the park by forcing him at gun point. She rarely shows emotion, but she hides a very sensitive side. Her gun can be summon from any exposed skin as it is infused magical to her body. After Kanie becomes the manager of the park, she starts developing feelings for him, even if she dislike is arrogant demeanor. The last main character is Latifah Fleuranza (Voiced by Yukiyo Fujii), she is the princess of Maple Land and she asked Sento have Kanie meet her. Due for some reason which is about her frail body, she can't stay to far from the castle in the park. I would talk more about her and the other characters, but because of spoilers i can't say more but trust me, the characters are very well made. \\n\r\nNext is presentation, Amagi Brilliant Park is very much colorful and the looks like a very will made anime. It using a similar art design as Is the Order a Rabbit?, as the character are alive with color, the scenery is very lively and overall is very well designed. The characters' animations on screen are smooth, their facial expressions and body language are realistic. Next is the sound/voice acting, the music used for the opening song is very catchy as it beat fits the style of the anime quite well. The ending song is beautiful as the artwork shown when it played is great. The background sounds and music are well created and really fit the feel of a amusement park and the voice acting is very well done as every voice fit it character quite well. Lastly the topics used in the story are well written and doesn't seen out of place and very Interesting.\\n\r\nNow my thoughts about the anime. Amagi Brilliant Park is a very well written anime as it doesn't leave any plot point unfinished by the end of the show. It is very funny and it has a very magical way to make you care about the characters i really can't explain. The characters are very well created and i love them all, but i really like Sento because all i can say her answers to problems is great. Overall i think the anime has been created with a lot of care and has a great story that all can enjoy. I recommend this to everyone as even if a very few scenes are little questionable, all in all it just really fun to watch.\\n\r\nWith that said, Amagi Brilliant Park is an anime that should be watch as it concept is unique as there not really an anime like it and can be enjoyed by all ages. If you like unique concepts, liked Is The Order a Rabbit?, just like anime or look to see what anime is like, then i would recommend Amagi Brilliant Park.",

            "content": "I'm really glad I watched Amagi Brilliant Park, one reason being it stems away from the generic storyline of anime its kind. ABP is best described as having a \"slice of business\" vibe with a magic orientated twist, making the comedy aspect a lot smoother and unique throughout the show. What's not unique or amusing about a bunch of drunk, lewd-minded mascots running around a magical decrepit amusement park? \r\nI honestly thought every aspect of this anime was really well balanced. Not too many jokes, the jokes they did have were actually funny since the character development was decent and the romance didn't flood thestoryline which left it simple and light hearted enough to sit back and enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters were well designed, leaving me with a major crush on Isuzu. She wasn't your average brain dead hot girl in a cute uniform, she was a blunt, seemingly insensitive bad ass with an awesome gun, PLUS the cute uniform. Despite how cold she comes across, throughout the show it becomes more apparent how sensitive and misunderstood Isuzu is, making her more relatable.\\n\\n\r\nSeiya Kanie also wasn't your typical male protagonist, his irritating, perfectionist-totally conceded vibe was portrayed well enough to leave you somehow still loving him. Yeah, he's a cocky prince, but through his hard work and time at the park it's made apparent he's a kind-hearted, caring and overall lovable one at that.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the shows short length, the rest of the cast were all well developed. Very unique and dynamic characters, not just boring background noise. They added a very nice touch to the show and really shaped the perfect atmosphere for the park. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Very vivid and colourful, a definite pleasant watch. Made me fall in love with all the characters. That HD baby.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not much to say really, nothing special but definitely above average. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Definitely worth a watch if you're down to relax to a unique, quirky show with brilliant(heh) artwork. \\n",

            "content": "How could a perfect, prior child actor, mythical princess, rage-stricken mouse and a perverted pink pomeranian (alliteration much?) recover a slumbering theme park from to its old days of glory?  I'll admit, I literally had no idea how the hell that was going to happen before I tuned into Amagi Brilliant Park.  This is one of those shows that grabbed my goldfish attention span with a sticky glove and refused to let me get to my ever-growing backlog.  I was in the mood for a lighthearted series with lots of laughs and colorful pizzazz, nothing more.  What Amagi delivered ended upbeing a pleasant surprise in the slew of mediocre shows coming out these days.  And I don't give out 7's to just any show \u2026 well maybe I do.\\n\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is a story about a perfectionist high school student named Seiya Kanie with a knack of pissing off literally everyone around him with his incessant narcissism.  I mean the dude is named after Kanye West! I feel that speaks volumes of his character and personality from the get go.  Through a date arrangement with a fairy royal guard member named Isuzu Sento, he is tirelessly recruited into helping a magical theme park help to restore its popularity and subsequent revenues in order to stay in business.  The entire effort is led by a frail Princess named Latifah Leuranza (named after Queen Latifah herself) who was crippled by a magical wizard and forced into a permanent form of a 14 year old for eternity.  I know this sounds ridiculous (and it is), but bear with me.  Once Seiya delves deeper into helping the park's members out, he quickly realizes how deep in doodoo they actually are.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't generic by any means, so I have to award some credit for originality.  However, it doesn't entirely avoid pitfalls that most short animes fall into (plot holes, under-developed antagonists).  Also, although adapted from a Light Novel by Shoji Gatoh, there are certain parts of the this adaptation that didn't translate over to the anime.  I tend to forgive this small issue, since I don't really read manga to begin with.  I mean, think of how many movies differ from their associated novels.  Seiya has a large number of interesting interactions with the other park employees as well, including plentiful physical altercations with Latifah's uncle Moffle (yes, he's actually a mouse and yes, he's the same Moffle from Full Metal Panic if you didn't already realize that).  At first, it just seems as though the reasoning for Amagi Brilliant Park needing to acquire more guests and popularity is purely monetary, but an unfolding backstory backstory of how the park was created sheds new light on that opinion.  Since the park is \u201cmagical\u201d, it relies on assimilated energy from the guests happiness due to visiting the park to stay in operation.\\n\\n\r\nAll magic and character antics aside, the writers actually do a decent job at making you feel a sense of empathy for the magical fairies that reside at the park.  You end up cheering them on to get the amount of guests they need for that day, as well as shedding tears when things don't quite go their way.  Seiya does a fantastic job at playing the leader and manager as well, and he's initially very honest with them about how much they suck at being adequate magical carneys.  I mean that IS what they are, right?  Also, through the weeds of hilarity and vulgarity, there are quite a number of uplifting morals contained in Amagi.  I wouldn't necessarily let young children watch it (thanks Tiramie!), but even the pretentious intellectuals of the anime community could find one less anime to shit on for not being intellectually challenging enough. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a boat load of characters to enjoy in Amagi Brilliant Park.  Seiya is initially the MC you love to hate, constantly admiring himself in the mirror and putting his vanity on display, but he contains a reasonable amount of depth as the series progresses.  Not only do we get to understand why he is such an asshole, but the writers also shed some light on his child-acting past and his previous ties to Amagi Brilliant Park itself.  I always enjoy animes with protagonists I don't want to take a figurative shit all over due to their annoying sense tropey-ness.  Isuzu is a great character balance to Seiya in many ways.  She's no yandere, but she does have deadpan humor (or no humor for that reason), and can tend to violently police Seiya and the other members of Amagi's cast.  Not to mention that she's got the looks and endowment to make her a staple on any pleb's waifu list.  I wouldn't be surprised if one or more otakus out there had a pillow made of her after the show aired.  Latifah is frail and often passes out during periods of too much physical exertion, but she does make some good food.  Oddly enough, she was also blind in the light novel, but perhaps the anime directors assumed this would distract viewers from the rest of the story.  Besides her over-arcing role, she didn't really get much more depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast has something for everyone.  The aforementioned anime-jumping Moffle often scuffles with Seiya, and he has a tendency to fly off the handle, but when it comes to his niece Latifah, he plays a softy in every way.  Moffles best friends are Tiramie, a pink pomeranian and Macaron, a male sheep who plays the violin and can be somewhat of a dead beat.  Tiramie is hands down one of the funniest anime characters I've ever come across.  The constant perverted jokes and cat-calls he makes at women coupled with a love for explosives ensures there's never a dull moment with him around.  I literally went almost the entire show without realizing he was not a girl.  This dude is fucking hilarious! There's also 4 voluptuous vixens that double as the Elementario fairies, each with a unique personality but they often fight as a result.  They provide the seemingly necessary fan service in Amagi.  This anime has such an insane amount of characters, that I couldn't list them all, but due to this a problem arises with character development.  It's really only there for Seiya and Isuzu.  I would almost argue that this show doesn't need it to keep me entertained, but it would probably catapult even higher on my list if that were the case.\\n\\n\r\nIt can be really hard to rate the art in modern animes.  I mean, it's kind of all starting to look the same if you think about it.  In Amagi's case, the art style neither helps nor hurts it as an overall series.  It's pretty to look at, but if you really pick it apart I'm sure you could find plenty of tiny things that would irritate your pompous critical side.  I can applaud the relatively complex character models this series possesses between the animals and inanimate objects that are personified and made lively and colorful.  The voice acting is well done, and not to sound like a fanboy or anything, but Ai Nonaka did fantastic as Tiramie.  Well, at least I was correct in my presuming the role was played by a girl...  I also thoroughly enjoyed the opening of Amagi.  It really pumps you up for each episode.  I feel that an OP should either add some depth to the series, or get you excited for the upcoming episode.  Sometimes it's like the producers say, \u201chere's this semi-intelligent premise, oh and here is some random ass OP that has completely ruins the vibe the show was going for.\u201d  The ED was nothing special, and being that it was only 12 episodes, I felt that it was better to just binge instead.  Sound effects were spot on, and the rest of the OST was okay, but I never really noticed there was background music to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Amagi Brilliant Park for what it was.  The series was a slight anecdote to my backlog and it fill well as both a comedy and a motivational genre.  I would recommend this series to someone who just wants to take a break from all the shounen or serious animes they've been watching as of late.  Although I don't expect this world to be explored again, I think it act as a pillar for a series of sequels, if it were in the writer's future plans.  Thanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "Ahh Amagi Brilliant Park, hyped because it is animated by the legendary Kyoto Animation...and rightfully so. I will try to not spoil anything, though I am not very experienced with writing reviews so we shall see how this goes, please understand Senpai.\r\n Amagi Brilliant Park boasts beautiful animation and a beautiful soundtrack (I love the opening theme). Kyoto Animation does what they do best with stunning art and a memorable soundtrack, combined with a frenzy of laughs. Every episode is humorous and worth the watch, never does an episode seem to overstay its welcome (If only all comedies could be like this). \r\nOur main character.Kanie,is dragged to an amusement park by fellow student Sento (sound familiar? Well kinda) Where he is told that he must help magical strangers attract guests, with the intention of saving the park. Kanie must hit a target goal of 500,000, or the park will be shutdown. Seems rather lighthearted, and it really is, however as we move along we see a plot start to develop, one that really brings out the hero (If that is really a word to describe Kanie)  in our lovable mc Kanie. \\n\\n\r\nKanie may be the center of attention, but the other characters get a solid share of the spotlight. Each character contributes to the comedy in his or her own unique way. Each one has it's own purpose and none of the characters feel out of place...or maybe they are all out of place so it works out...idk. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Amagi Brilliant Park is not on my \"must watch\" list when recommending anime to friends, but it is however just below that magical. I would recommend Amagi Brilliant Park to anyone looking for a lighthearted anime. The comedy is well executed, and is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack and beautiful art. It does not introduce any new concepts, but it is a great example of the tried and true, and if you give this enjoyable series a watch, you might just find something magical.",

After that, it switches to a slice of life and comedy style of story telling, where this goal is still present, but in a background in a unintrusive form. I think it helps to enjoy the characters and the fantasy elements even more.\r\nThe anime adapts the light novels in a non-chronological order and changes afew details in characters. Although these details are not that important and will not make the anime feel chaotic and out of touch with the novels. (I would pick up the light novels, but there is no translation group that picked it up and yen press didn't license it so far.)\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is dominant during the story. Well, he is more of an \"OK\" character, but I had more fun and enjoyment with the fantasy side characters. The way they adapted to the world is hilarious. They have the best lines and moments in the story.",

            "content": "Amagi Brilliant Park is a high energy, fun comedy anime with a large amount of characters that all have their own unique personalities. There has been a lot of hype built around this anime, many people saying that this is a must watch, one of the best anime of the fall 2014 season, possibly one of the best of 2014.\r\nI for one, did not receive any of said hype, and didn't watch while the show was still airing. I eventually started watching Amagi Brilliant Park a few months later, and boy did I miss out on something amazing!\r\nSummary: It begins by introducing our self absorbedMC, Seiya Kanie, who has been forced to go on a \"date\" to an amusement park by our main heroine, Isuzu Seno. From this, he is brought into a world of magical creatures from another world that want him to help get 500,000 guests in 3 months. Can, or will he do it?\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the review!:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nThe story was pretty straightforward, the park in trouble of being shut down, if the goal of 500,000 guests was not reached within 3 months. For the most part, it was pretty episodical, though there was still character and plot development each episode, making the show pretty enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nWow, I have to give credit where it's deserved, the art was absolutely amazing, though the animation was average, the beautiful art made up for the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound was very consistent, the Opening and Ending songs were fantastic, especially the Opening song, it got me pumped up to watch each episode! LOOK AT THE SKY IT'S MAGIC HOUR!! Ahem... Outside of that, the OST was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nNow the characters, while some seemed a little generic, they put a twist on each character to make them unique to the show... and I loved each and every one of them. From the self obsessed MC, socially challenged heroine, to the perverted and hilarious mascots, I truly loved all of them, and the interactions between all the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can I say, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, I found myself laughing at almost every joke and funny moment, and caring what happens to the characters at every point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nCreators of Amagi Brilliant Park, Bravo! You made a great anime.",

            "content": "What's it like behind the scenes of a theme park?\r\nI've actually been backstage before at Disneyland, way way back in high school (over 20 years ago... damn I'm old). It's busy, and remarkably mundane. Although I'm told that management insists the staff adopt a happy attitude in the \"Happiest Place on Earth\" at all times (even more so in Tokyo Disney, which, fun fact, is in Chiba prefecture), I would imagine that it's a constant challenge to plaster a smile on your face when you're around kids when the preparation was stultifying, dull, and boring. I would be very surprised if a good number ofthe staff at the big theme parks aren't like the mascot trio drinking themselves silly after a hard day's work or otherwise finding some way to completely deflate.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Amagi Brilliant Park (\"AmaBuri\") sits on two rails: comedy (mostly slapstick, which is KyoAni's forte), and drama. To be honest, the drama did feel like watching someone play a Rollercoaster Tycoon scenario while being trolled by the loan shark, especially with the rolling counters at the end. Some of the slapstick looks straight out of The Three Stooges, which is perfect because we have 3 mascots, and there's always a little bit of circus clown/mime in both The Three Stooges and theme park mascots because a good slapstick act means you must get the audience to laugh without words. It's harder to perform than it looks, but I bet it's a bit easier to draw it.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama's \"challenge du jour\" motif (reinforced by the episode titles) did a decent job of driving the story forward, but sometimes this was just distracting filler (e.g. the Seiya Suit episode and the OVA). Nevertheless the buildup to the climax is well-executed, and that final plot twist makes me hope for a second season (I kinda doubt they'll green-light one, this wasn't a bestseller).\\n\\n\r\nLike any good comedic show, every character has a funny weakness, and the show mercilessly explores the weaknesses of just about every main character (with the possible exception of Sylphie) and even some of the bit characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a bit like \"easy listening\" or \"elevator music\" with better instruments. Now, that sounds like a bad thing, but KyoAni did something rather cool with it-- a lot of the tracks are theme music to the rides and attractions at the park, so they recorded the music played back over inexpensive loudspeakers. I think this was a nice touch, creating the illusion that we're actually at a run-down theme park. The opener, Extra Magic Hour, is by one of my favorite bilingual artists, Akino with her brothers and sister. While it's not a Yoko Kanno tune, it certainly puts one into the mood for going to a magical amusement park, and the opening animation evolves as the cast grows-- nice touch. The ending is catchy, and yet, like the song that's sung by the same quartet in one episode, feels like a way to push yet another idol group and record sales.\\n\\n\r\nI think the main weaknesses are the characters of Latifa and Isuzu-- Latifa could've been an automated croquette dispenser in a dress, and it wouldn't have mattered for most of the show. Isuzu was used as moe fodder, making her a recurring target of Macaron's/Tiramie's pranks or flying into a quiet jealous rage when she sees Seiya with another girl. Sometimes it was funny, other times I wished they would write something better for Isuzu like during the big rain storm.\\n\\n\r\nI'll toss in a couple of counterpoints to the argument that Seiya couldn't possibly run a theme park business. (1) It's FICTION. It's heavily fantasy-themed fiction. This is a stretch of the imagination, not an outright mathematical impossibility. Save your critical wrath for the latter. (2) Seiya, Isuzu notes in her research, is a genius-level overachiever with show biz experience. I would not be surprised if he absorbed a lot from his manager and countless producers during his brief career as a child actor. Remember, a theme park is show business, and while actors often don't get involved in the business side of the industry (they really should, IMHO it's one of the reasons why they struggle to stay afloat), it shouldn't be too much of a stretch to imagine a genius-intellect former child actor knowing why this act is in trouble and how to fix it.",

            "content": "The story of Amagi Brilliant Park involves characters named Maple Landers from another dimension (probably Canada) that moved here to gain energy from happiness. Other than that fact, it's mostly realistic, with running a theme park and gaining fans and revenue. \r\nThe story is pretty interesting, captivating me for the first couple of episodes. I lost some interest watching it at some point, but being the otaku I am, I don't tend to leave anime behind without completing them first; so watching a few more episode got my interest back. So basically, what I'm saying is that the anime can be interesting, fun and boringat times.\\n\\n\r\nThe design is great. Some eyecandy here and there (cough, big bust, cough), as well as some cute looking characters. What I REALLY like though, is Isuzu's gun...damn.\\n\\n\r\nThere aren't any visible flaws with how the characters speak, but I would opt for an English dub. As for the music, it's pretty good, but I like the song in the intro the most.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters each have their own unique personalities. It's also somewhat satisfying to see Kanie's transition from narcissism to the opposite. Still loving the gun. The diverse personalities are a great thing for a peppy anime like this, but it wouldn't really hurt to include a few other ethnicities, right?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was pretty fun to watch but like I said before, it can get boring sometimes. I recommend adding a sudden turn of events in some episodes to keep the interest consistent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it has been a very good anime. It was pretty colourful and fun to watch as it neared the end.",

            "content": "Amagi Brilliant Park was mediocre and had very lopsided pacing. The idea of the story was meh to begin therefore its unfair to be too judgemental of the execution. The art and sound were all fine, thats not really an issue for me. Im more of a story and character guys so ill judge the show solely on those two elemts. As i said before the idea of the story is very underwhelming. The show is episodic in nature with each episode being either the addition of something to the park or some sort of scheme implemented by the main character to help drum upbusiness, there is slight variation but these are far and few between. The ending was very lackluster and unbearably predictable. This isnt inherently a bad thing however twords the end the story tried to focus on Latifa and tried to make the weight of the situation more intense. This really didnt do it for me because she was painfully underdeveloped and acted more as a motivation device to, as stated earlier, add urgency to the situation. Instead of caring about her well being because she expressed attractive character traits, the show tries to give her a pitiful backstory as well as a mysterious disease in order to tru and gain the empathy of the viewer. This to me was just lazy. I understand that they only had 12 episodes to work with but you would think one of the priorities should be developing your main plot device because without that development no one will care about the outcome of the entire show. Latifa isnt the only failure of a character in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are fine. They often have one episode in which there prescence is heavy then proceed to fall of in subsequent episodes. I could go on about how underdeveloped they are as well, but like Latifa, they are a plot device. The show shot for quantity of quality to try and increase the urgency. They wanted the effect that adding all these characters would add to scope of the park, making its closing affect such a great amount of characters. Thats fine no complaints. Im also categorizing the main three mascots as supporting characters as well because even though they have distinct personalities and offer something to the show in their own rite, i felt they as foils to the main characters was more important to the overall story. The only two characters i would consider to be main are kanie and sento. Kanie is a douchebag. Hes supposed to give off that impression that he truely cares about others but is afraid to let anyone get close to him and acts like a douche as a self defense mechanism. Thats fine. Original? Not by any stretch of the imagination, but fine. Mediocre mc is mediocre. Sento on the other hand had the potential to be a great character, but suffers from one of her iconic features, her gun. At first the gun was very interesting to me but got stale later on. I found it interesting that she ruled by fear and was tyrannical, but she did it all with good intentions. She didnt know anything but brute force so thats what she used to get results, but like any tyranical leadership, things fell apart, which of course she couldnt understand why. I liked this, i liked this a lot, but what killed it for me was when she used the gun to prevent character development. It was lazy writing. When someone would say something that made her uncomfortable such as bringing up Kanie as a potential partner for her, instead of literally any other reaction, she would just pull a gun on them and they would cease the discussion. This fits her character in the beginning because it is clearly a self defense mechanism, but later on as her character progresses, which is extremely slow due to her limited dialouge, it would make more sense for her to slowly ween herslef off the gun and then towards the end discard it as a mechanism entirely. She also suffers from being extremely one dimensional, the scenes where she displays a change in character are very few, as in maube 3 if you're lucky. Like i said her introduction was good and her psychological value was good in the beginning, but the show shifts too much attention away from her which is very unfortunate.",

            "content": "BMW has been known to be manufacturers of German luxury cars. They include manufacturing motorcycles, and owns the Mini and the Rolls-Royce. As much, with all the German engineering under the bonnet and tech-savvy interior, their cars are known to be rear-wheel drive (RWD), in which they handle well on oversteering and horsepower delivery. In 2015, they made a front-wheel drive (FWD) car for the first time, called the 2-series. BMW says it's a revolutionary car with all the commercials on saying how great and awesome and passion and won't be mistaken as your mum's car.\r\nThat kind of \"revolutionary\" approach brings me to Kyoto Animation(KyoAni), as they produced Amagi Brilliant Park (Amaburi in short) as the revolutionary anime they have, yet.\\n\r\nAnd that's the problem, because it's like this: BMW is known for producing RWD cars, it's their trademark. It's the same way as KyoAni is known for the moe trademark they have established since the K-On--or even the Air era. Now, I'm not saying that K-On or Air should be the basis for KyoAni's products, but like BMW producing FWD cars, is KyoAni doing something similar as they seem to be producing something that is...for their own first time, playing fire with the lesser kind of anime where its fantasy genre written only in paper. That's something that KyoAni is not known for.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY = 7\\n\r\nIt's a story of reviving an amusement park (eponymous as it is), filled with magic elements, packed with reasons of how important the Amaburi amusement park is for the magical creatures, and plot and characterization ignites from there.\\n\r\nBeing magical, logic is excused here as most of the characters are the usual teens (Kanie-kun and Sento Isuzu are both 16) with their hands full of trying to revive the Amaburi itself. I mean, talk about legalities and debits and credits, net profits, taxes--put them in a box and throw 'em out the window. Rather than logic, you'd better just focus on these: there's the fanservice team, a perfectionist-- rather narcissistic kind of male character, a princess who must be Dekomori's cousin, and a soldier from the magical land, and oh--living mascots, and supporting characters. All of them are tasked to attract 250,000 visitors for the Amaburi in a span of 3 months. At first glance, it has a huge potential, but somehow if it's KyoAni we're talking, we're demanding it to be KYOANI, the same way as if you'd get a BMW and you're demanding it ofc to be a BMW (and not something from let's say, Hyundai).\\n\r\nWhat actually happened was like, we expected KyoAni, and we got something that resembles JC Staff. Because even if I'm not using K-On as the yardstick of this all, and I dunno if the Amaburi magic worked in your senses a little bit too well, but we're expecting KyoAni itself to be as moe-music-friendly as K-On, or sublime as Hyouka, or light-hearted slice-of-life as Tamako Market, or romcom as Chuunibyou, or flaring as Kyoukai no Kanata; perhaps even as memorable-dramatic as Clannad, and as emotional as Air. I could go on to be as wacky as Nichijou, or otaku-approved as Lucky Star, or as demanding as Haruhi Suzumiya.\\n\r\nIn Amagi Brilliant Park, what did we get exactly? We get \"revolution\". We get the \"new KyoAni\". See, this is just like how BMW made RWD cars for so long and suddenly started building FWD's.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 6\\n\r\nThey're as memorable as a shopping list: you remember them as you know what to do with it. It also has the KyoAni prowess of somehow, at least somehow, exercising character development.\\n\r\nAgain, as I've said earlier, the story itself has a huge, and I mean very huge potential. KyoAni has made 23- or 24-eps back in the past, perhaps longer episodes can do well as to give enough space for the development, in which the plot will be delivered with characters that transcended as the number of episodes progressed.\\n\r\nKanie-kun was rigged from the start to be complex but unchanging 'til the end. Sento Isuzu is the \"best hot heroine\" according to otakus and fandoms and those from the magical doujin-land; I don't see why--except that she's the new fantasy material with her physical hot body and fanservice--but character-wise, she's the KyoAni's version of what a kuudere is, but that's it: she was predictable and nothing new or magical or developmental that happened to her. There's also Dekomori's seeming cousin, Latifa-sama, seems to be good enough as the foil character, but flat. The K-On look-alike fanservice team of Sylphy (resembling Mugi), Muse (resembling Yui), Kobori (resembling Mio), and Salama (resembling Ritsu) did well on their fanservice role, had a one-episode dedication for their development and was leave-able after.\\n\r\nThen there's the trio of mascots: Moffle, Macaron, and Tiramie, whose main purpose was maybe, to become comic reliefs. Though Moffle is more of serving as a complex character to help junction the plot and explain the reasons. The other two, you will find them funny, that is, if you're a goober.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 8\\n\r\nUsual J-pop songs with KyoAni-esque trademark in them since Hyouka, so I really don't need to complain. Picking the right seiyuus for the right roles have also been important, and with Ayako Kawasumi's performance as Moffle--and she's renowned as Saber--that's already a plus.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 5\\n\r\nIt's like enjoying what you can do with a tap water. You can put juice powder on it, ice, and stir.\\n\r\nAmagi does that very well as you're hoping to get KyoAni elements but every episode seemed like it's convincing you on how \"new and revolutionary\" this is. Really, it's like BMW convincing you of their new and revolutionary 2-series.\\n\r\nThis is like convincing yourself that you're watching KyoAni's Amagi Brillaint Park and not Kagaku-railgun.\\n\r\nIf you've gone to BMW and saw the 2-series yourself, it's pretty much like that: you're expecting a BMW, and it is revolutionary only because you've never heard a front-driven BMW before.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow, people love Amaburi in a way that it's more sexy that you're seeing more skin, more Sento Isuzu, more of those fanservice fairy team which means more eyecandy, then less on moe-ness, more on read-between-the-line jokes, less on KyoAni trademark and feel in the end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 6\\n\\n\r\nIf KyoAni defined this as their new quality, their new trademark \"flagship\" anime where from here on, they're going to be making more anime this way, then more otakus will rejoice. The minority here ain't otaku: we enjoy KyoAni as we like enjoying good quality shows that won't waste our time. But majority wins, I reckon.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, my review seems, as I want to say it, I derived it and wrote it thinking to be the KyoAni that I know, or used to know. It's like missing a friend who died or went away, and you know, you can't put this into exact words.\\n\r\nWhat I can say is that, despite giving this as a rating of 6 because it's still a generally good anime to watch, but somehow it doesn't look like KyoAni at all. Really, it just looks like JC-Staff material. Revolution is a good thing, but a lot of times it's difficult. Acceptance is not the issue, because there's trademark in every namebrand: whether BMW, or Coke, or Marvel, or McDonalds, or Levi's, once you've attached yourself to a namebrand, you'll ultimately know and feel it with its trademark. Amaburi just kind of lost the touches there--or if they haven't then they're the new trademark of KyoAni. It's still KyoAni by namebrand, but like the BMW 2-series, finding that out to be 3-cylinder front-drive is Hyundai material--when we're expecting for a BMW.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: The majority screams for Amagi Brilliant Park is the new KyoAni. But I kind of miss the old KyoAni.",

            "content": "There are an unassailable number of anime out there, too many. Logically then, there are going to be a very large number of truly great anime. But I haven\u2019t watched them all, and probably never will. Why? Because I\u2019m already having fun. Why am I having fun? Because I\u2019m watching Amagi Brilliant Park.\r\nKyoto Animation are the undisputed kings of the moe slice of life style. Anime like K-On are thoroughly enjoyable rides if you accept that Mio is just the best girl, whilst Clannad is a masterpiece of the anime world, despite the fact that Key are seemingly only capable of drawing side-characters with purplehair. There is a sense of sameness though to a large number of Kyoto Ani\u2019s shows, a sense that they\u2019re a one trick pony. That is, until they released Amagi Brilliant Park. For better or for worse, Amagi Park is a noticeable departure from the standard mold, not least because it spends less than 99.99% of the time OUTSIDE a high-school.\\n\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is set in a magical amusement park. It\u2019s populated a variety of chirpy characters, with talking animals, a fairy who thinks she\u2019s a helicopter, and a dragon suffering from acute anxiety. Most importantly, it has Kanie Seiya: our narcissistic, arrogant and friendless protagonist. Yes, that was not a sentence I would ever have expected to write in a review for a Kyoto Ani show. For once, Seiya is not the layman protagonist who attracts girls with his aura of affability. I definitely wouldn\u2019t say he brings an air of maturity to the KyoAni roster (far from it, he\u2019s about as idealistic a character as you can get). What he does is bring a likeable cocky persona to the table. Cracks in his armour of confidence do begin to appear throughout the show though, and so Seiya thankfully isn\u2019t all talk. He\u2019s a fully-developed character, but simply chooses to hide behind an exterior that can get things done. It\u2019s something that KyoAni show themselves capable of doing just as well as their Aizawas or their Tomoyas. \\n\\n\r\nAs the protagonist, Seiya is tasked with rebuilding the park and attracting 250,000 visitors, or else the magical staff of the park will lose their popularity and die! He has no mean challenge ahead of him then, but the challenge itself though is not the focus of the show. Enter his side-kick and \u2018obligatory KyoAni love interest\u2019, our very own Isuzu Sento. \\n\\n\r\nNot quite a tsundere (lovey-dovey under a \u2018it\u2019s not like I only have eyes for you, baka\u2019 layer), and at the same time, not quite a kuudere (lovey-dovey under a \u2018I couldn\u2019t care less if you fell out of that window\u2019 layer). These are the two features that most define Sento. She is efficient, but trigger happy and very willing to pull out her trusty shotgun, often with hilarious if painful consequences. Although Sento suffers from a distinct case of inexplicable in-love-with-the-protagonist-for-no-particular reason-it is, she is still the more empathetic character of the two \u2013 she suffers from nervousness when interacting with others, often resorting to violence as she pulls her gun from underneath a skirt that seemingly holds TARDIS like qualities. Sento is loveable and entertaining in the very opposite way that Seiya is, but their chemistry is more than enough to drive the show, and largely overshadows the artificial drama set-up for each episode. No, there are no panty shots as a result of this \u2018TARDIS\u2019 skirt, but I hear Highschool of the Dead is very happy to see you now.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ve probably noticed by now, but entertainment is an approach that plays a much larger part in Amagi Brilliant Park than in some of the more dramatic pieces Kyoto Ani has become known for \u2013 many episodes I did indeed find myself in tears, not from sadness, but from excessive laughter. The OP is insanely fun and catchy, and I\u2019ve not seen anything quite as entertainingly ridiculous as when I watched three stuffed animals sitting down to a pint of beer, but it\u2019s situations like these that Amagi revels in. There\u2019s a good blend of more innocent and inventive humour more traditional to KyoAni, and a very adult, crude approach as well. It may be a KyoAni show set in an amusement park, but sometimes the show is anything but child-friendly!\\n\\n\r\nSo I definitely enjoyed the show. There is a \u2018but\u2019 though. And that but is this: Amagi Park is very similar to many of the shounen anime out there. Amagi Park may be a departure from Kyoto Ani\u2019s norm, and that\u2019s to be welcomed, but it starts to become inseperable from other popular shounen titles in the process. Kanie Seiya\u2019s cock-sure personality is something we\u2019ve largely seen in shows like No Game No Life\u2019s Sora. I have grown accustomed to Kyoto Ani shows emphasising the moe fan-service, and Amagi Park doesn\u2019t buck this trend, but it introduces a surprisingly sexual sort of fanservice into the mix. It\u2019s one of the few problems I have with the show: I wanted and expected to innocently enjoy this storyline, and on a few too many occasions I was vehemently obstructed by several busty pairs of PLOT (those milk secreting mammary glands females have). \\n\\n\r\nI should note that, for better or for worse, Amagi is simply not a finished story. It's got an ending that successfully manages to tie up the 13 episode series, there is still ample room left for what will presumably be another season. It\u2019s not a bad ending, justifying the drama that had been building up the last couple of episodes, but it leaves me vaguely underwhelmed. Regardless, I look forward to the inevitable Amagi Brilliant Park!!/Amagi Brilliant Park: After Story.\\n\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is light-hearted and whimsical, largely satisfied to be nothing more than harmless fun and looking pretty great to boot. If you\u2019ve enjoyed this year\u2019s lineup of shounen anime, no doubt Amagi Brilliant Park will leave you satisfied. If you\u2019re a KyoAni fan, you may find yourself disappointed with quite how the show doesn\u2019t take itself seriously enough, and doesn\u2019t feel quite finished. Ultimately though, you\u2019ll probably find yourself surprised at how, even when it\u2019s not particularly serious or a tearfest, the KyoAni magic is still there, making Amagi Brilliant Park both a visually impressive and wholly enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations: No Game No Life - Seiya and Sora are similar arrogant and good at getting the job done. Both are set in a fantastical world with magic, with a mixture of drama, comedy and fanservice. Also both need a season 2!\\n",

            "content": "Oh you. Amagi Brilliant Park. Why are you so damn brilliant? Why must you name your characters after hip hop artists? Why must you take Full Metal Panic's mascot? Why does the sheep look like a character from Xi Yang Yang? The answers to these is... cause it literally doesn't give a fuck,\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park didn't just surpass my expectations on how wacky it is, it took a rocket fueled with thousands of metric tons of 5 hour energy and completely flew past. It's a gripping tale about Kanye West, who gets forced into a full time job by 50 Cent in order to managea run down amusement park so that they can save Queen Latifah. Pretty accurate synopsis right there.\\n\\n\r\nYet even so, I found myself yawning through Amagi Brilliant Park like a lecture in school. With such a wacky premise filled with potential, both comedy and story wise, Amagi Brilliant Park instead used it as an excuse for absolutely annoying characters, very little substance, and freaking fanservice for Full Metal Panic fans. Although, they do have the same original creator... so I guess it's ok? Either way, Amagi Brilliant Park definitely delivers on the wacky, but doesn't deliver on the fun. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Hella wacky!\\n\r\n- More than zero character development. While it may not be engaging, at least it's there.\\n\r\n- It's KyoAni, there's nice animation and stuff.\\n\r\n- A very mixed show, it's not a pure comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Due to taking so many references from other shows, it is very cliche at times.\\n\r\n- Ending wasn't explored more.\\n\r\n- Way too many characters, and they are all annoying too! A lot of them exist just because.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nWhat I thought was going to be a show without any relevant story ended up having an unexpectedly relevant story that somewhat built up to a surprisingly decent ending. Everything that goes on within the show, both comical and non comical, is all for the main goal that the characters have, which is to reach the quota needed to keep the park in business. This gives the characters' actions some impact, as they aren't doing their silly things for nothing, they are all trying to work for a greater purpose! Even so, Amagi Brilliant Park's story had very little direction and while it did lead to a kinda satisfying conclusion, the actual story is basically just a jumble of random bullshit. So, it's basically random bullshit that somehow has the end goal in mind? I don't get how it works either.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nIt's KyoAni, so... it's brilliant? The art is amazing and the character designs are really nice! If you can make weird ass mascots look cute at times, you are doing it right! If you can make said cute mascots also look extremely hostile, you are also doing it right! The animation is beautiful as well! Just your usual KyoAni things.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\r\nThe OST isn't really worth mentioning, since it's just there. The OP is catchy though, and it's by AKINO with bless4 which is nice! The seiyuus nailed their characters extremely well! 50 Cent definitely sounded like an awkward anti social girl with big boobs, and Kanye West sounded like a prick with a huge ego! How accurate can these seiyuus be??\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nTruly, an amazing cast of characters! Kanye is a narcissistic bastard who is smart and knows it. He loves himself more than anything, and finds himself superior to everyone else. 50 Cent is a kuudere at heart, being very cold hearted and hostile to everyone, but on the inside, she's just a sensitive maiden. The way these two meet was definitely a great way to make a first impression, involving guns to the face. If only it were as epic as that afterwards. In reality, the human characters of this show take a very unmemorable stroll throughout the story while the actually memorable characters, the goddamn mascot peoples, are jabbering away at the foreground with their poor comedic taste and extreme personalities that come off as annoying as fuck. Some characters, like Latifa, are literally there cause why the fuck not? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nWhat can I say, it's alright I guess. Only a few jokes were funny but overall it was a pretty cringey festival.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this to anyone who wants wackiness, but other than that, Amagi Brilliant Park was a mediocre surprise.",

Otherwise there's plenty of much better comedies out there than this.\r\nStory:\r\n--------\r\nHaphazard and disjointed drivel.  No coherent thought or cohesion.  It bounces all over the place and at the same time (I stopped after watching episode 5) never goes anywhere.  It's just bad and it hurt to watch as far as I did.\r\nArt:\r\n--------\r\nMediocre at best.  Certain aspects are used repeatedly and that gets tedious to see.  \r\nSound:\r\n--------\r\nRepetitive and annoyingsongs.  The sound itself was good though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nA bit of thought went into the characters but not so much to make it above a 4 rating in my book.  Lots of characters just blend together by episode 5.

There is just something about her character i like that i can't really describe. \r\nLatifa  ( Princess) is in tie for the most interesting character.She actually has a curse on her that is actually kind of sad.

Occasionally I re-watch it when I'm feeling down, cause this is the kind of anime that just puts a smile on your face. It's not mainly all comedy, there is in fact an actual backbone to the story, however, the execution of that story is done in a light-hearted and humorous way.\r\nThe animation was done by KyoAni, so you know that every single episode is going to look amazing. I think the music used within the anime all fit the general tone of the show, giving you a sort of hype that youwould probably feel if you went to an actual amusement park. The characters are lovable and their interactions with one another are enjoyable to watch. It's not like their aren't moments of despair or hopelessness, so don't worry about the sweetness leaving a bad taste in your mouth. Just watch it, and enjoy every single moment of it.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, watch it, especially if you're feeling down and out of it. I can assure you that you'll be feeling right as rain in no time. (Well, actually in almost half-an-hour's time, but you get the point.)",

            "content": "Coming into this show I had high hopes. I've been on a bit of a kyoani binge and I was yet to be let down. Well the show wasn't exactly bad, but it could have been amazing if it had been a little more cohesive. \r\nStory: 7\r\nthe premise of this show is really cool and unique, the main problem I have is this: inconsistent tone. I think if it had gone all the way with the wacky ott aspect of the story, making it completely surreal and fun it would have worked far better than trying to force subtle character drama into a show thathas talking walrus pirates. If you're gonna have characters that are basically giant stuffed animals, then you shouldn't take yourself so serious. I mean the main characters are all named after rappers, I really don't care about their subtle drama I want to see them fucking about in an amusement park. If there is drama it should be way over the top like the rest of this world is. Why even have the main character be in high school, it only comes into play in literally one episode. Have him be an adult. It doesn't have to go all out comedy with it, it should just be more fun and play up those surreal aspects more, to feel more fantastical rather than trying and failing to ground these characters in the real world. That said, some of the girl characters are well written enough to carry the story so it's not actually bad, it's just disappointing because I could see it being so much better. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIn terms of character design and backgrounds, there is no argument that this show is beautiful. All characters have distinct designs that reflect their personalities and make them stand out, even in this large cast. The backgrounds are stunning and really feel alive.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe music for this show is good, but not appropriate unfortunately. The OP is great, sets the tone for the show and is suitably wacky and over the top. However the BGM  seems to take itself way too seriously, a reoccurring problem for this show. It's never clear if a scene is supposed to make us feel happy or sad, if it's comedic or dramatic because they use the same music for all types of scenes even when it doesn't fit. The music on it's own is pretty strong but it just feels out of place with the world the characters inhabit. In general, the voice acting is passable, nothing incredible but it does it's job. Foley is also just sort of there, nothing outstanding but nothing actually bad either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nTo be frank, I'm a sucker for some cute girls, and these girls are cute as h*ck. I can't complain there. But they are not the cutest, in fact by kyoani standards these girls are pretty lacking. What makes shows like k-on, tamako market and hibike! euphonium so good is that the characters feel real as well as being cute. They have full personalities and aren't just a combination of light novel troupes. This show uses the common tactic of just giving characters one trait, and that's their whole personality, rather than actually having them be well rounded and human. There's the rich girl, the kudere, the clutz, the girl who's always on her phone, etc. If I asked you to name one more personality trait of these characters, you would struggle because it doesn't exist. And the MC, well, I thought I'd get something interesting here. In the first episode it's revealed that he's very narcissistic and I thought \"hey, this could be interesting, a main character who isn't just a blank insert character and actually has flaws and a past\". But instead, it's barely mentioned again until the very last episode really. And the whole thing about him being a former child star is never explored properly either. Where are his parents? Why did he quit being an actor? Why was he chosen to help the park? Why is he quiet at school? All these questions are asked and never answered \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nIt's fun, the characters are generally likable and the plot is just tangible enough to keep you watching. Strong start, weak middle and strong ending (not counting episode 13 because what even was that, the show already ended they just put an extra episode for no reason)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nDisappointing, but only because I had high expectations going in. The first shot of the series is of the muzzle of a gun, a very strong opening, but unfortunately the rest of the show doesn't quite deliver. But it is laugh out loud funny at some points, and the girls are cute. If you're a busy person and don't have time to waste, skip this one. But if you're a lazy weeb like me give it a shot, you might just be surprised.",

            "content": "Pros:\r\n- Great humor (A couple episodes had me absolutely laughing my butt off throughout.)\r\n- Great storytelling that really grabs the audience and makes you feel a wide range of emotions throughout.  Highly entertaining, all in all.\r\n- Well written (albeit not the most developed) characters.  As the plot progresses, you definitely form enough of a connection with these people that you want to see the park succeed.  Because of that I give props for execution.\r\n- Great execution of backstories throughout.\r\n- Unique idea that stands out among other anime.\r\n- Good voice acting\r\nCons:\r\n- (SPOILER ALERT) Would've liked to seen a more conclusive ending to thestory arc regarding Latifah's curse and the evil wizard.  The way that arc concluded seemed a bit muddled and confused.  I feel like because of that a second season is warranted. (SPOILER END)\\n\r\n- This is very obviously a plot-centric series.  Because of that (as mentioned previously) the main characters aren't as developed as they should be (particularly the two main leads.)  This is a bit of an issue, but I wouldn't say it ruins the show as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised by this.  I wouldn't go so far as to call it \"underrated\" per say, but I do think it deserves some more attention than it seems to get.  The story and concept stand out for their originality.  It kind of reminds me of some of the video games I'd play when I was younger like \"Rollercoaster Tycoon\" and \"Mysims\".  The amount of creativity they throw in regarding the theme park concept really does a good job of world building, plot development, and in some cases character development.  This will definitely be a series I will remember, and most likely re-watch in the future.  Its manages to be really fun, while also having a lot of heart and creativity thrown in the mix. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Amaburi is a place of dreams, hope and enjoyment... That's how the premise was supposed to start and yet\u2014 it was the usual reverse-psychology plotting. Bad advertisements, poorly maintenance on the attractions, wacky dolts as entertainers. The hectare field of an amusement park is the setting where magical elements is the focal point. Oh yeah, we can already see how it'll go.\r\nThe synopsis have given me a rough idea on what Amagi Brilliant Park is. A place where bankruptcy is knocking at their door's end, a saving hero will turn the situation 180 and happy ending is achieved. Starting with an original MC plus theinteresting three stooges along with beautiful girls with large circle eyes, I had myself hooked up from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSolid writing. The author didn't bother making the story complex to garner the watcher's interest. It is also the winning formula of Amaburi. As far as the story goes, the series only had one problem, 'How to win 500k customers in a limited time'. Within this hurdle comes along many variations on which it gave us a good watch for a 13 episode long title.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nUsual Kyo-Ani standard. Frankly, I am really not a moe enthusiast but Amagi's art department is such a hard thing to resist. I find myself liking every character, whether he/she be a supernatural like Moffle and his two friends to the ever beautiful Sento Isuzu, Latifa plus the rest of the chicks. Everyone has a good art, not only the characters but the amusement park itself.\\n\\n\r\nSound is good as well. I play a little piano and soon as I finished watching the series, I started poking the keys just to make the tune of the ending which I really, really like... Bgms are also fitting. Whether it be a sad tune due to a predicament or an exciting one because of a hype twist. Nothing beats good music when you're watching a good show. It's a must and Amaburi had played their aces well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPerfect characters. Of course, the crew is vast so only the highlighted characters are the ones I'm talking about. Kanie Seiya f.e. This guy is just too original. Unlike overpowered MC and flawless bishounens, Kanie himself had the fundamentals of being one of the generic but hey, turns out he's the 'real' deal. Whether it be his past or his series actions, he was always a good and entertaining watch. In the end, realizing that 'no man is an island' he came to accept everyone despite his terrible narcissism. That itself makes his worthy of his screentime. Plus it's also thanks to his VA who wonderfully depicted the character.\\n\\n\r\nSento and the other girls. Oh damn, these girls are just too beautiful. Sento and Latifa in particular, who would obviously turn Kanie's romantic interest if a sequel lits up in the future. Sento, who also got a terrible view on how to associate herself and Latifa, who at first episode, looked like she was bothered by a terminal disease. Oh man, she's just too adorable. Honorable mentions are the fairies. Muse, who got the most screentime definitely looks my type of girl but hey, Amagi's girl are all my types. Please don't touch them... XD\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I wouldn't miss the three Amagi pillars. Most especially, my favorite character in the series, Tiramie. This dirty old dude is just too good. I had myself on a laughtrip because of his antics. Whether he be deliberate on doing rotten lewd acts or just too stupid to do things right, he is just awesome...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9\\n\\n\r\nFor a normal 13 episode series. Some tends to do things like inserting irrelevant fillers. I don't read the reference. But if Amagi has one, then its filler is still wonderfully threaded to its main story. As per my mention above, the story is still the main winning formula. Not too complicated to the point it tried too hard yet not too lax to the point it never tried anything. The story is very easy to empathize and easy to appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nConcluding, if there's another standout gem last season including Bahamut:Geness, then it's definitely Amagi Brilliant Park. Good laughs, good story, good characters, minimal fanservice. The 13 episodes will keep your time worthy of watching, will keep you on your seat entertained and will never leave you bored. A recommended watch for everybody. So come and watch Amagi Brilliant Park and wish for a sequel in the future!",

The concept of the story is reaaly interesting: parks are, in fact, magic kingdons. The plot is simple, but kept me interested until the end. The princess' curse is never really a main theme. It ends with a rushed conclusion.\r\nThe art is great. The characters are all very diffferent. I love the idea they had for the mascots. Is a very colorfull anime.\r\nThe music is good, but not outstanding. I ended skeeping the opening many times.\r\nThe characters don't really get any development. There isa hint of romance and a love triangle that never happens. There is also a hint of the main character past that is never developed in a satisfactory way.\\n\\n\r\nFor the enjoyment, I had a great time watching it. It is a quik watch. No commitments needs to be done. I can recomend this for anyone that want to spend a nice afternoon relaxing.",

            "content": "Synopsis:\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is about a magical park having to close down due to the lack of popularity, hence they invited a high school student as their manager to save the park, by hitting the quota of 500 000 guest for that year. Basically the show is about their daily experience, and how they gradually try to attract more guest.\r\nStory:\r\nI am not giving any spoilers, so don't worry. Talking about the plot, amagi brilliant park has a simple and straight forward plot. However it is still interesting and enjoyable. There are quite a lot of humour throughout the show, so it doesn't bored me todeath. Although the pacing might be slightly slower at times, but it's mainly because they only pass 3 months for the entire 13 episodes. There aren't any plot holes in the show as well so the story is quite a solid one. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe show is done by Kyoto Animation, so the art is great. Things are vibrant and nice, characters and background are nice looking too. The movements are also smooth and natural. Their animation follows more towards the exaggerated kind, which makes it humorous at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThey did quite good on characters. Everyone certainly get a decent screen time in the show. Hence the character in the show is really good. We get to know everyone personality in depth and especially the male character where he get quite a bit of character development, where they even talked about why is he selected as the manager.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's a good and fun show to watch, definitely not a masterpiece but it definitely won't waste your time watching. Initially I thought it was a show mainy about fan service but nope, it's not.",

            "content": "\"Hey man, how was your day yesterday?\"\r\n\"It was...pretty weird.  This new girl in my class forced me AT GUNPOINT to go with her to the worst amusement park I've ever seen.  And guess what?  She wants me to manage the park and improve it!\" \r\n\"LOL, so what did you say to that?\" \r\n\"...I accepted.\"\r\nAnd there you have it, the premise of Amagi Brilliant Park or Amaburi.  Admittedly I didn't jump on the bandwagon immediately, but from past experience I knew what Kyoto Animation was capable of, so I decided to go along for the ride...and man was it a fun one.\r\nStory(7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the anime pretty much sums up the story; the MC, Kanie Seiya, is given 3 months to improve and attract 250,000 visitors to the failing Amagi Brilliant Park.  A simple premise to say the least.  However, the anime makes great use of pacing to make up for it.  The park doesn't just turn into DisneyWorld overnight.  Kanie, as perfect as he thinks he is, is only human.  Under his control, the park is slowly brought together, is put through many tough situations, and utilizes many trial and error methods to improve itself.  This whole process made good use of the anime's crazy and diverse characters and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): \\n\\n\r\nDone by the renowned Kyoto Animation, the art was every bit as good as I expected it to be.  Many bright colours are used throughout the anime, which contribute to the happy and lighthearted mood.  The characters designs are numerous and very unique, almost childish, which definitely contribute to the atmosphere of a cheerful amusement park.   I just don't know what else to say, I'm a KyoAni fanboy :3\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe OP \"Extra Magic Hour\" is a really energetic and upbeat song that actually left a big impression on me, and made me genuinely interested in the anime.  The cheerful and optimistic beat really captures the mood of the anime and is definitely noteworthy.  The OST and ED are less overwhelming, but still fit the mood of the anime nicely.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe vibrant colours and upbeat opening would all have gone to waste if it weren't for the diverse cast of characters.  The main characters aren't particularly noteworthy. You have the self-confident and perfectionist MC Kanie Seiya, the serious and busty Sento Isuzu, and Latifah, the overly nice princess.  The large cast of supporting characters, however, make up the flesh of the show.  You have everything from perverted pink cats to closet otaku weasels to gigantic timid red dragons, all of which contribute to the show's humour and even the plot since many episodes focus on the introduction and development of these characters.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was one of the most hilarious and colourful things I've seen in a while and the end of every episode left me thinking \"wow it's over already?\".  I enjoyed pretty much everything the show had to offer, especially the catchy OP, the diverse characters, and the subtle fanservice (more Sento pls).  \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I jumped on the Amaburi bandwagon just to see what KyoAni would bring to the table this time, and I can say I'm definitely not disappointed.  Overall, I'd recommend this to people looking to relax after a serious and intense anime or just anyone who enjoys comedy.  In conclusion, I'd say that Amaburi was definitely a rollercoaster of a show.\\n\\n\r\n\"Dang, why would you accept a job like that?\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Uh, their croquettes were good.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What once is a flourishing amusement park with large attractions and fun mascots is now in shambles. Everywhere you look inside are in shambles and everything has just fallen apart, forgotten by society. And now you have to make it popular once more, in 3 months.\r\nIs it possible?\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park tells the story of a boy in his attempts to revamp and bring this park into glory once more. This is what I think of this series.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nSo in short, it's about a boy who is forced into helping the park's staff attract more tourists into their park. Seems simple enough, which I find tobe really great. This is because 1) it's really simple to understand and follow their main motives without being drowned in subplots and 2) It really allows for other subplots to develop that bulks up the main plot as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are beautiful and very unique. The incorporation of the diverse, magical staff of the park (which I found to be particularly cute) as well as the humans (whose designs exceed my expectations) brings a wonderful-looking cast into play. The park itself doesn't look to bad either from a view. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to sound, I found the OP and ED to be perfectly fitting to the whimsical and comedic theme of Amagi Brilliant Park. Just listening to it brings a good vibe to you. The OP is one of the things that really got me into the anime series and the ED is alright, although I frequently skip it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally love the characters and their diversity. I admit that I first expected the characters to be the typical kind that matches their designs. Fun-loving, cute, and friendly. They are, but they have so much depth that their character development interests me. Moffle, Tiramie, and Macaron's characters really makes me love Amagi to a whole different level.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really do enjoy Amagi Brilliant Park and I always look forward to the new episodes every week. It contains humour, comedy, a great theme, and pretty much anything you'd expect in this series! One thing I've got to say is how they build upon the development of a theme park, which is a nice approach since I also love theme parks since I was a child. I look forward to this. Always.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nIt exceeds in pretty much everything. Each episode is able to develop the story further while not making it too boring since there'd always be some running gag or a continuous series of jokes. Amagi Brilliant Park is an anime series I recommend to people who enjoy watching Comedy or Slice of Life since it contains similar aspects to other series of their genres. Definitely worth watching!",

            "content": "Welcome to Amagi Brilliant Park! Where your manager is a high-school student and 70% of the staff aren't human. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is actually quite original, as I have never seen an anime dedicated to a theme park the perspectives of staff working in it. The story was solid, but sometimes it would drag out, though that didn't affect the story that much, as it was more interesting than boring even though there wasn't any action scenes at all. It was funny to see how each character responds to each reaction, because some of their reactions can be really stupid. There's harem in the anime,but it's barely noticeable because some of them don't show their feelings that much. Same goes with romance, but later on the anime Isuzu starts to show some interest in Kanie. There's actually fan-service in the anime, but it's mild.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing, but expected from an anime that finished airing at the end of 2014. The animation is smooth and the colors are darn bright and eye-catching.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST in the anime was used whenever it was necessary and matched the each scene the OST was used in. Even though the OP was catchy, it didn't quite fit the anime. I'd think that the OP was more for an action + romance anime. The ED has lyrics that fit the 4 element characters (water, fire, wind and earth) and does fit the happy theme of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to classify a character as a bad one, it would have to be someone who is really annoying and easily gets on my nerves. Did this anime have anyone like that? Nope.\\n\\n\r\nKanie Seiya, the main protagonist of the story who likes to compliment himself, like telling him that himself he is a perfect 10 in any outfit. He's a very cocky person, but is also hardworking, to the point where he would do anything just to save a person from dying. \\n\\n\r\nSento Isuzu, a monotone character because of her background. She uses guns to threaten people into helping her, because she doesn't know how to ask politely. A very mysterious character and has funny responses, such as crying to a very badly produced video.\\n\\n\r\nFleuranza Latifa, a very calm, kind and elegant character. She is the type that has a strong heart on the outside, but is very emotional in the inside. Before you question yourself about her age, all I can say that is she isn't under-aged. A type of character who thinks of others before herself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like this anime, mainly because it's new to me. Even though I'm used to action, this anime somewhat calms me down and makes me happy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something new and unique, then this anime might suit you. Would I re-watch it? Yas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so the anime is over, Amagi Brilliant Park or Amaburi, pretty much a theme park where the main theme \"This is [not] a fantasy,\" ok, I can live with that, but really this is one good fantasy based anime where main theme goes around the supernatural humans living in the park, but enough of that, here are my ratings for this anime:\r\nStory\r\nLike I've said, it was one good fantasy based anime where a the fate of the theme park, that is about to get down on the dumps, rest on the shoulder of one guy-and you've probably guess it, it's a guy who sharesthe same name as Kim Kardashian's hubby, Kanye West, geeez I hate that guy. So, the story line was unique, sine we don't see a lot of magical being living among the human population and in a modern time. Also, the plot doesn't depend on the usual harem [cu'z there isn't any] or the fanservice [where, there are quite a few] to entertain us audience, rather, the plot balances the slice of life element with a touche of drama and comedy. But, I still can't fathom the fact that is the usual high schooler who should grow up fast to do a job that should done by a grown up, so it's a 7 for this part.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\\n\r\nI would have liked the illustrations of nearly every background and building in the anime, I would have like the way them mascots were drawn, but ther was still an ecchi element in the anime art pertaining to the characters, and I'm referring to Sento's work outfit, I wuld have like seeing her wearing a professional business suit and high school uniform, but not her work clothes that is serious crime of fashion. The Elementaro's on the other hand, looked good in their street clothes, but in their work uniform........let's see, Muse and Salama really does make them look like performers, Sylphy, looks like a whore, while Koboli looks more like a stripper, since she is the only one whose panty is showing and if this anime has an fanservice element, it would be her. Nevertheless, one part of me like this animes art and another part of me is making a fuss over Sento's work clothes and Sylphy ad Koboli's work outfit, so, it's gonna be a 6 here.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving it an  for the opening \"Extra Magic Hour\" by AKINO, and the closing \"Elementario de Aimashou\" by by BRILLIANT4 . I also like the karaoke scene where the Elementaro were stuck in some castle and have to sing a song 'Fantasy Time,\" so, it's an 8 for the sound.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk, I don't if it is true that Original Creator,  Gatoh, Shoji really, did based his characters name from famous rapper or movie stars, but one thing I know that, I didn't see any character name after, Soulja Boy, Snoop Dog, Pharrell or Rhianna... Ok, so lets go over to some of them:\\n\\n\\n\r\nSeiya Kanie- I really can't fathom that he was left with the job that should be done by a grown-up, thought at time I kinda hated him for his Devil in Prada attitude towards the park's personnel, but then again it was that attitude that save the day for Latifa, so for him alone I have one reason to give this part a 7. I still don't get why his name was taken from Kim Kardashian's hubby, Kanye West, I nerve like the guy's rapping style, but I like his bad boy attitude.\\n\\n\r\n Latifa Fleuranza- I kind like her sweet and innocent traits, also her being this helpless hundred  year old girl {if that's how old is she} trapped in a  year body was something else, since it does add to this anime's sweet touch, so she is another reason why I'm giving this part a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSento Isuzu- I kinda like her for being this gun toting bitch who knows how to put those mascots in check, since it adds to this anime's comedy element, but I kinda hate her for being the cause of the park's further demise since it was her trigger finger that scares the shit outta everybody. It rather ambiguous if she has any romantic feels for Kanie nor does Kanie have any feelings for her, so one more reason for a  7 in this part.\\n\\n\r\nMoffle- Is one bad mascot that's funny.\\n\\n\r\nTiramie- Is one perverted mascot that adds to this anime's comdey element.\\n\\n\r\nMacaron- Well, let's just say that he is part Moffle and part Tiramie in terms of his attitude.\\n\\n\\n\r\nElementaro- For a while they did provide the kind of spunk that adds to this anime's entertainment value, thought , Koboli still looks like a stripper and Sylph looks still looks like a whore, so it's my last reason to give this category a 7. Maybe, Orginal Creator,Gatoh, Shoji  should have given Muse the name Beyonce, Salama as Nick {Manja}, Sylph as Jennifer {Lopez} and Koboli as Rhianna.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall, where I giving both of it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nWell, it was enjoyable to a certain point, but I still can't fathom that such job is left to a kid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\n-It was good, but not that good, since the anime as a whole indirectly makes the older characters like Ashe a fool.\\n\\n\r\n-Cu'z there is their is a plot hole that conflicts Latifa's as to how she was able to remember Kanie when her info states that every Aug, she undergoes a kind of rewind that she'll forget everything as what has transpire during the course of her life. Then again , she is one sweet character.\\n\\n\r\n- There is also a plot hole as to how the wizard who to put a curse on Latifa manages to still be alive, when info states that Latifa's father had him killed, but then again, for a brief moment as  Takaya Kurisu, he did provide a certain climax to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with my review done, I leave it to you muchahos out there to watch and judge for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nA favorite pastime of many people, young or old, is visiting the local amusement park. Roller coasters, pools, mascots, and food are staples of such areas. It's a time to relax, a time to just enjoy what the attractions have to offer. At its core, an amusement park is nothing more than a place designed to bring fun to the customers who visit it. In Amagi Brilliant Park, they challenge such a broad statement, finding that there is more to ferris wheels and play castles.\r\nSTORY\r\nAmagi literally starts with Isuzu, an employee of Amagi Brilliant Park, holding a boynamed Kanie up with a gun. She asks him to come with her to her job, and makes a very strange request of him.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does something rather curious: it brings to light the problem, doesn't address it directly in the middle, and picks it back up again by the end. That is to say, there is seemingly no central conflict despite there being one. This honestly shouldn't work; common story-telling elements have basic frameworks involving drama and resolving it. The only \"villain\" is the park itself. So, how does Amagi get away with it? The answer is in the comedy. For all intents and purposes, the show is a comedy first and drama second.\\n\\n\r\nTo this end, the anime decides upon an anecdotal premise. It's essentially a series of short, segmented stories that build upon one another. The drama is taken care of indirectly until it can no longer take such an approach. That is, until the ending demands a swift resolution. Kanie and Isuzu investigating a closed-off arena, \"Ironbeard\" invading the pool, and them looking to hire multiple new people seem distracting or out-of-place within the story. But the entire purpose of what they're doing is to solve the issue at hand without having the audience worry about it.\\n\\n\r\nTalking more specifically about the comedy, Amagi goes about achieving it in a variety of ways. It utilizes character quirks (such as with Tiramie and Macaron), visual gags, observational humor, and dialogue jokes. All of this is possible because, again, the setting provides the foundation. The areas they visit are not only magical in nature, but also unique enough between them to give a vast amount of scenarios in which to present the comedic moments. That is to say, it isn't technically the characters, the plot, or the writing that brings about the comedy, but instead the environment that evokes it from them.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, one must talk about the ending (not the final episode). Looking at it realistically, it is one of the largest plot contrivances in existence. While it may have a one-line explanation, it comes about without rhyme or reason. By all accounts, it should be treated as a massive negative. But alluding back to earlier, the anime was never interested in the drama. It was simply there to get the characters in one place. So it being solved in an unsatisfactory way is quite lame, but falls in line with the show's overall focus. And where does this ultimate solution originate? The answer is, once again, the environment.\\n\\n\r\nTying these thoughts into one, where are the comedy, drama, characters, villain, and story all found in? The answer is the setting. It's there in the title; this isn't an anime about Kanie realizing he is no longer bored, it's not about Isuzu falling in love, and it isn't even about Latifa overcoming her illness. It's about what the park is, what it brings, and how it connects everything together. In other words, it's literally an anime all about Amagi Brilliant Park.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni comes through once again across the board.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the anime itself is vibrant. Filled with an explosion of different colors, the show is never afraid to have a wide palate during any given situation. Everything just screams \"fun,\" as an amusement park should. On top of this, the detail is usually apparent, from the background scenery to the lighting. Since the anime's focus is on the setting, a lot of attention is rightly paid to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are given just as much detail as the environment itself. The main cast see intricate employee outfits and modern, casual clothes. The remaining employees embody specific roles, and are drawn (jokingly) as such. For example, Wrench is literally a wrench and Jaw is a shark. It sounds simple, but they look the part while being given more facets than typically deserved.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation maintains the stride created by the art before it. As examples: explosions, both quick and slow character movements, differing facial expressions, multiple objects in motion, etc. It's a plethora of techniques that keep the experiencing from ever feeling dull.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAmagi actually contains a weak main cast supported by a strong side one.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically the star of the anime, Kanie exudes confidence. His arrogant attitude and unwavering determination allow him to be the leader that the park needs. Not afraid to speak his mind, he often butts heads with Moffle and the other employees due to his ambitious plan to renovate the land. While he begins the season being rather unforgiving, he ends it coming to the realization that there is more fun to be had doing what one loves as opposed to brooding. This development is rather awkward, with him not entirely changing his ideals until moments before the finale. Simultaneously, he proportionally provides the least amount of comedy given the amount of screen time he holds. His snide remarks and sociability make him cool, but still a rather flat character.\\n\\n\r\nThe literal Princess of the park, Latifa is a young girl with a heart of joy and a smile that could melt ice. Classy, proper, and kind beyond measure, she only has the well-being of the people attached to Amagi within her mind. Physically weak, but a master at cooking, she is usually found within the kitchen making another batch of sweets to be shared. The majority of the drama within the show revolves around her, and since the story ignores it, she, too, is sidelined for a large portion of the anime. Contributing cuteness rather than comedy, this is the correct choice, even if it causes her development to be clipped.\\n\\n\r\nIsuzu, loyal subordinate to Latifa and right-hand-woman to Kanie, is pure sex appeal. With a great body and brains, she lets her magical guns do the talking for her. Her speech and attitude are mostly unemotional, due to her lack of exposure to regular, human interaction. Surprisingly, she is unintentionally daft when it comes to simple tasks. But this actually allows her to be one of the funnier cast members. The feelings she has for Kanie remain sheltered at almost all times, once again causing her to fall into the camp of underdeveloped characters. She's sexy and beautiful; there is no doubt about that. Sadly, she isn't much more.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the mains falter, the supports come through with flying colors. This is mostly attributed to their overall better hilarity, but also by their constant inclusion and unique moments (for example, the final episode).\\n\\n\r\nExcluding Tiramie and Macaron, the lesser cast bring about a nice amount of comedic variety. Wanipi's (the alligator) fretting over losing his job, Eiko's (the \"AV\" woman) calm narration despite the situation, and Tricen's (the triceratops) endless hunching provided the anime with a nice set of characters that performed both of their jobs -- both in and out of the show -- wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the strongest humor-wise, Tiramie and Macaron are brothers-in-arms. The former is perverted to a fault and the latter is always in the wrong place at the wrong time. Together, their antics bring much discomfort and troubles for Kanie, Isuzu, and everyone else. They actually enjoy going along for the ride, hoping to see what crazy new events will ensue. They're pretty one-dimensional, but for them, that's perfectly fine.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final aside, it's important to take into account the overall purpose of the show once more: the park's influence on everything within. If we look at each character/group of characters, this becomes apparent. Kanie's minimal development is created by good times he had while working there, Latifa's problems were solved by the land, and Isuzu is able to show off her assets numerous times due to the place's current status. Even the side characters are connected, with the park providing them not only their jobs but the venues in which to enact their gags. In a way, one could look at Amagi Brilliant Park as its own character, giving every other cast member the ability to be who they are because of it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is an interesting one, with its orchestral feel and rough singing. The slow build-up, clapping, and background vocalists cause it to be quite memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe same cannot be said for the ED. It's okay, with the varying singers given an opportunity to sing along to the nice drum beat. The background instruments give it a fairy-like vibe, while the ending, trailing effect ends it on a whimsical note.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is okay for what it is. It provides the necessary tracks at the right time, with carnival-esque tunes and happier arrangements filled with saxophones and bells. Sadly, there is nothing to listen to outside of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting-wise, everyone involved performs above average in their respective roles. A nod should be given to Ai Nonoka as Tiramie, Ryoko Shiraishi as Macaron, Ayako Kawasumi as Moffle, and Ai Kakuma as Isuzu.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThere are many laughs to be had with this one. At the same time, the show also incorporates everything else an anime viewer has come to expect: \"moe\" and even fan-service, despite the studio backing it. Watching Tiramie just be himself, seeing Isuzu in a bikini or pirate outfit, and having Latifa act as adorable as possible were always enough to have me come back every week. The only facet really missing is the romance. It touts itself as being one, but the romantic elements within are very minimal, making for a highly unsatisfying relationship between the main couple.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the show that brings even more smiles are the girls of Elementario. Sylphy, Kobori, Muse, and Salama each have their own personalities and quirks, making them both all-around fun and individually exciting. They are actually given the most development throughout the entire series, going from a haphazard group to a sensational music troupe. Of course, this is done by the park per usual, serving as another example of the show's ultimate goal.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the place will never truly exist, Amagi Brilliant Park is a fun time to be had. With an interesting set of stories, quirky characters, and color galore, the \"Magic Hour\" is never a wasted moment.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, the park literally sets the stage\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, art, character designs, and actual animation are all vibrant and wonderful\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, weak main cast, strong supporting cast\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, good VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, nice laughs, cute, with unsatisfying romance\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Often times, as with many fans of anime or just media, I'll spot an ad for a show that'll make me go 'I want to check that out sometime'. You keep saying that over and over, until its been almost a year since the original viewing of the ad. For a while, this was me and Amagi Brilliant Park. I finally sat down, bought the DVD, and I loved it. Not just love, I adore it, it's become one of my new favorite comedies.\r\nThe story is pretty good, but it's not amazing. It's just insane enough to help ever other element jump off a decentsized diving board into a pool of creativity and wackiness. I love the idea that amusement parks are homes to creatures from magical worlds. It's a little bare bones as far as a narrative goes, but it has enough fun and creative spark to it that helps me overlook that.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best parts of it is that it nails the characters down perfectly. Kanie is kind of an ass, but that's why I really like him. He isn't some pushover like a lot of anime characters you'll find in this type of anime, he's got balls, and he's not afraid to do whatever possible to keep the park open. He has a big ego, he isn't really a softy, and even though he's still a decent guy who's helping everyone, he isn't afraid to be pushy if needed. I like that. Sento is also more fun than I thought she'd be, I figured she might just be the sexy character. But, similar to other attractive characters like Yoko from Gurren Lagann or Takao from D-Frag, she has a fun personality. She's usually more reserved in her emotions, but when she shows them, it's fun or dramatic. Plus, her constantly using her gun is hilarious. The mascots are comedy gold, the anime is relentless with punishing them (more often than not, its completely deserved, which helps separate it from anime where punishment towards characters for comedy feels more more spirited than funny). They are just constantly hysterical, and I love how it pokes fun at how similar Moffle's design is to the mascot from Full Metal Panic, that bit of self-awareness really worked for me. The rest of the cast is pretty good, though Princess Latifa is a bit of an issue for me. She sticks out for not being as fun or funny. She's an okay character, but she doesn't leave much of an impression.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is surprisingly pretty great throughout the show. Often times you'll see an anime like this that has episode 1 syndrome, where episode 1 looks better than the rest of the run, aside from maybe the finale. Just about every episode here looked great, which was a pleasant surprise.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is of course hilarious and off the walls, full of punishment and character based comedy that works 90% of the time.\\n\\n\r\nMy only issue is again, Latifa, as her big character moment towards the end of the series was not as strong as they would've wanted, at least to me. Plus, the villain reveal was pretty lame and unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I love this anime.",

It's not trying to be revolutionary and on the surface it looks like a mediocre pizza. But just because it isn't revolutionary doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable to eat. But if you stop for a moment and appreciate its taste, beyond its surface it actually has some complex flavours to it, however it would take a while to appreciate it beyond its surface as a fun light hearted pizza that most people can enjoy.\r\nIt may have weak and simple flavours, withsimple and basic ingredients but because it has so many fun and simple ingredients that in itself makes for a new flavour that is a delight to enjoy. This is a rare case where Quantity actually beats Quality. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a gourmet or deluxe pizza, Amagi ain't it.

            "content": "So, to who would I recommend to watch or avoid this light hearted comedic anime?\r\nI would strongly recommend this if:\r\n1. You want something different concept wise (In a sense of comedy)\r\n This story sets in a hint of a fantasy(?) world where the MC is given responsibility to restore a near abandoned amusement park. And unlike a lot of the comedy anime that tries to set a different concept, this series really sticks to its roots, and gradually illustrates the development of the amusement park to an extent that I actually would like the series to be longer to explore this in more profound depth.In essence, this series is not an \"everyday school romcom\" that follows all its corresponding cliches.\\n\\n\r\n2. You are looking for a decent light-hearted anime.\\n\r\n Sometimes we just want to get away from all the deep and dark part of anime, and if you are looking for a series to get away from the dark aura of Death Note, PsychoPass etc, this is a perfect getaway without feeling like you have watched a load of nonesense. (I mean typical cliche harem light-hearted series)\\n\\n\r\n3. You do not want an element of romance.\\n\r\n Romance can be a pivotal factor of the genre of romcom, and this is what defines a good romcom from a bad one. But many of the times, romance element can come with its drawbacks such as: dense characters, low quality harem and fan service (key here is 'low quality'), annoying tsundere and drifting from the main concept of the story. Amagi Brilliant Park offers no romance element, so it you don't like the factors I mentioned above, this might be the light-hearted anime for you.\\n\\n\r\n4. You want a comedy anime with a 'plot'.\\n\r\n What I mean by it has a plot is that the story is constantly heading somewhere. This is because the MC has a goal to develop the park into a certain standard within a time limit. So if you are not down for situational comedy (like Daily lives of High School Boys, Nichijou and Sket Dance), there's a good chance you will like this.\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, I DO NOT recommend this series if:\\n\\n\r\n1. You are looking for a top quality pure comedy series (obviously)\\n\r\n If you want something that will make you laugh your arse off, this is not it chief. I'd recommend something like Gintama, Nichijou, OPM, Daily lives of HSB if you want something really good. (or Seitokai Yakuindomo, Grand Blue or Hinamatsuri for something a bit less mainstream)\\n\\n\r\n2. You want romance (harem?) as well as comedy.\\n\r\n Despite the occasional annoyance and misunderstanding, tsunderes can be cute, and you get none here. As well as MC's harem. And also fan service. Although I would say there is a ship, the characters have close to zero romantic encounters in this series.\\n\\n\r\n3. You are searching for a well written story.\\n\r\n Although I would say the concept of this anime is very nice, it is quite a predictable plot. There are also some random characters and its Disney-like ending is dodgy, anti-climatic and doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But this is not the point of this series, as it is focused on comedy and it may not bother most of the people. This doesn't impact the comedic aspect of the series at all, but if you are bothered that the plot is noticeably weak at times, you may want to avoid this series.\\n\\n\r\n In essence, Amagi Brilliant Park is not a brilliant comedy series, but if you are looking for some chuckles or a general light-hearted plot to take away some of your boredom, this is the series for you.",

By no means is this a deep or intellectual anime, but rather 'fun'. The main plot is solid enough in it's entirety, although towards the end of the anime the true antagonistic force that initiated the whole situation is revealed and 'dealt with' in a un-fulfilling manner, almost as if to allude to a sequel, of which there is yet to be one. But for me it was never about the plot, but rather the journey. Theshow has its serious moments and thankfully never unravel into a montage nonsensical slapstick madness. It's coherent comedy; it's not harem/romcom stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nA sequel would though be nice; and I would definitely watch this anime again. Good clean colorful fun.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I honestly wasn't sure what to make of Amagi Brilliant Park when I learned of its existence. It was the Full Metal Panic team coming back for the first time in almost a decade to adapt a Shoji Gatoh light novel about some dude saving an amusement park. It was called a \"slapstick drama\", whatever the hell that means. It had the rat with a hat from Fumoffu. I wanted it to be Fumoffu, but I read a bit of the manga beforehand and knew it wasn't going to be like that. As such, I went into the show with cautious expectations.\r\nThen I discovered thatthe main character was Kanye West as a Japanese high schooler. Then I found out that the cast included a bunch of weirdos like a perverted pink dog, a tough-talking sheep, a shark who turned into Jaws when splashed with water, a masked wrestler who acted as security, and a triceratops who does not hide his desires well. Then I realized that despite taking place in \"reality\", the show was about as unreal as could be. Then the show started parodying old classics like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Rambo, and...um...KISS? And it finally clicked with me around the halfway point: I was watching a Takahashi sitcom except made by today's standards.\\n\\n\r\nLet's look at this a bit further: Amagi is about a teenage boy getting roped into saving an amusement park because the employees are magical beings who need the energy generated by customers in order to survive in the real world. The one in particular who needs said park to survive is the princess, because of a curse placed on her due to her dad reneging on a deal he made (in other words, her dad was a dick). It turns out that the boy met the princess once as a child and swore to make her smile, thus establishing a connection between the two that will pay off now that the boy has grown up. From that description alone, you'd probably expect some sort of sappy Disney-esque love story where the main character uses his charisma and such to save the princess, and indeed you wouldn't be far off the mark.\\n\\n\r\nBut then things take a darkly comedic turn once you realize why the park is shutting down in the first place: because the management is f*cking terrible. The employees are a bunch of lazy assholes who have pride in their jobs, but they have no work ethic. They close the park on Fridays. They take unscheduled breaks when they're not in the mood. And no, there is no outside interference causing this to happen. The park simply sucks because the employees are a joke who don't evolve with the times, and now they're paying the price by having their very existence threatened. You know, just like real companies and the people who make them that don't evolve, except greatly exaggerated because the employees are live animal mascots or humans who might as well be mascots\\n\r\nAnd as time went on from that realization, I became more and more convinced in my claim. Yes there is a plot, and the show does work towards it throughout its entire runtime. But whilst shows like Arakawa and Zvezda use the comedy to tell a touching story, Amagi simply uses its plot as an excuse to tell jokes related to its wacky cast and company management in general. Even when the show dips into the serious territory, it's just so that they can setup punchlines for later, sometimes in the same episode. Kanye has a past as a child-actor, but it's never really used more than as an excuse to justify why he's so good at managing things. Fiddy Cent (Sento Izuzu to all you plebians) has a fight with Kanye over her behavior, but all that comes out of it is her gaining a crush on our hero, as well as for a later episode to use the results of said drama as a springboard for its comedic story (that admittedly, wasn't all that funny). I've heard people complain about the princess drama, and yeah it wasn't very good. But at the end of the day, it's just an excuse to add necessary tension to the show's end goal (whilst adding a man-eating plant chomping on the three stooges), as well as a reason for the show to continue in the future. It didn't change the game like Chuunibyou's tonal shift did. Hell, the actual resolution of the \"save the park\" plot was mostly just an excuse to have the characters suffer for our delight.\\n\\n\r\nThat's exactly the same sort of structure that Ranma and Urusei Yatsura had, isn't it? Each show set up a plot in its opening episodes - the males getting engaged to the females - and there is some progress regarding that throughout each show until it reaches its end (well, not really the Ranma anime) but most of the time, it's just used as a high-concept justification for all sorts of wacky adventures that add to its large cast whilst causing said cast to suffer for our delight. And what differentiates it from other LN trash that try something similar like Kore Zombie is that the situations, including the ones that aren't very good, have imagination to them and are supported by a cast of hilarious idiots whose saccharine appearance betrays their gritty personalities (again, like a real amusement park employee). Not everyone works of course - looking at you, Dornell - but the final piece of the puzzle that makes me love Takahashi's sitcoms as much as I do is because the majority of the cast is f*cking hilarious. From Kanye to Tiramie to Macaron to Okuro, these characters never failed to put a smile on my face with their antics.\\n\\n\r\nSo if Amagi is so much like my favorite anime sitcoms of all-time, does that mean that Amagi itself is one of my favorite anime comedies of all-time? Um...no.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I don't like about Takahashi is that she can't really do serious very well, and it doesn't help that KyoAni has a reputation for mishandling that sort of tone at a worse level than her, themselves. Even if it's necessary for future laughs to land and it only takes up an episode at most, it's still not that fun to sit through unless you turn it into a joke by the end of the episode. And whilst KyoAni do turn serious situations into humor more often than you'd expect from them in this series, there are times where they slip into their old habits. Episode 4 may been necessary to give Fiddy and Kanye more of a personal relationship, as well as show the weaknesses in Kanye's business strategies, but it still wasn't very fun to watch because the dramatic tone felt over-reaching and the resolution was quick and sappy. It's the second-worst episode (worst being Episode 9 with the focus on the Elementario) IMO, so thankfully the show doesn't really slip into that territory again.\\n\\n\r\nBut then we get into the princess's stuff. I won't go into detail regarding it, but whilst I didn't hate it as much as some of my colleagues since it worked fine as a plot device and never really got in the way of what really went on, that didn't change the fact that the resolution to her problems was lame, played entirely straight, and was poorly built-up to the point of Deus Ex. Yeah, I know she's still cursed and all - because otherwise, she'd be able to leave the park - but c'mon!\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest reason why this show doesn't sit amongst my favorite comedies though is that despite getting all the fundamentals right, I didn't find Amagi Brilliant Park to be gut-bustingly funny. Its quality is more akin to the later seasons of Ranma in that there's a few laugh-out-loud gems buried under a bunch of mildly interesting stories that are more weird than hilarious. Or to put it in more modern anime terms, Amagi Brilliant Park is to KyoAni what Ouran Host Club is to Bones: A decent show overall and much more preferable to the studio's usual - and more popular - output, but not something I'd consider a must-watch because the laughs are mostly moderate and it dips into the serious territory a bit too much for my liking. I can't really explain why the laughs didn't come as often as I wanted other than some awkward timing, focus on a character I didn't enjoy, and so on and so forth, but the bottom-line is you can't force yourself to laugh and Amagi just didn't cut it in regards to what I prefer from my humor.\\n\\n\r\nIf they do make a sequel to Amagi Brilliant Park sometime down the road, hopefully it's in the vein of Fumoffu where you can just forget the plot, focus entirely on the laughs, and the laughs will actually produce, well, laughs. Because as is, this property isn't a good enough indicator that KyoAni has recovered from the hole they dug themselves into with, well, everything not directed by Takemoto, post-Clannad. It's a fun show overall. It's nice to see that the Takahashi formula can still exist by today's standards. But it could have been so much more.",

Excellent animation and character designs,I love how goofy some scenes where,like when Macaron was putting the pill inside Sento's bento. Also even the background characters had faces. The only thing I didn't like was Kanie's character design. Excellent art and animation made me give it a 9/10, though there's nothing unique about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great, I liked Sento and Tiramie's voice actors, I think there's no problem with the voice acting in this anime,the only thing lacking was the bgm, it was forgettable and the only OST I remembered in this anime was the OP which was decent. So unmemorable bgm and OP but great voice acting made me give it a 7/10 rating.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThis anime was clearly character driven, most of them were fairly decent though other than the main cast, the side characters were also good and were fun to watch, especially the elves or the three human girls.  Though the lack of a clear antagonist and backstory, were disappointing, Kirisu Rakku rarely had screen time and never actually felt like an antagonist while only bits and pieces were explained from each of the main character's backstory excluding Latifah, I was satisfied with her backstory. So I give it a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis was a very enjoyable anime indeed, it made me laugh many times and kept me hooked for a considerable time, though I guess it was a bit too short, the pacing was also a bit too quick which made me lose a bit of interest but nevertheless this is a very fun anime to watch. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nGreat character's, decent plot,fantastic art,enjoyable episodes,good voice acting and lack of a clear antagonist,backstory and fast pacing made me give this anime a 8.5. I am eager for a second season of this.\\n",

Thanks.\r\n--CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS FROM EP1--\r\nStory:\r\nThe Story starts off with Kanie Seiya. a Perfectionist high school boy who has it All! Good looks, genious, and Excellent reflexes. Then one day, a Girl named Izuzu Sento. a High School Transferee forced him to go out on a Date; Seiya thought that would be a Interesting Date but Turned into disappointment. Seiya founds himself in Front ofAmagi Brilliant Park; Japan's worst amusement park. Rusted signage and benches, Old rides or Systems and Faded paintings around\\n\r\nthe place Proved how the Amusement park has Lost its Beauty and Popularity.\\n\\n\r\nDuring their Date, he didnt waste any minute to despise the park. He kept on Cursing, muttering how sick he is. Before they left, Sento introduced him to the Manager of the Park, Lafifa Fleuranza.\\n\\n\r\nWithout giving seiya the Benefit of doubt, Lafifa entrusted him to Restore  the Beauty  and Popularity of the Park.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nThe story was good. Great start, good plot, great characters and Some comedy scenes you should Laugh. But i'll give it a 9 due the misunderstanding? I dont think I can understand the other Scenes but it was Funny through, so 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nArt? Perfect. It was amazingly good. One cannot simply ask Kyoani's work. Giving it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe song \"Extra Magic Hour\" by AKINO with Bless4 really Fits the every episode also the ED. The pop and the Funky Chorus feels us Happy.\\n\r\nFor the Voice actor thing, The voice Actors and the Actresses fits the Characters well. I'll give it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all good, no Annoying Characters either.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nReally fun. (I dont know what to say, Sorry)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10!!",

            "content": "As a huge fan of Kyoto Animation I couldn't wait to dive into this anime!\r\nHaving watched almost every anime of Kyoto Animation I have to say that Amagi Brilliant Park is unique on its own and yet another stunning creation.\r\nWhile most high school comedy animes are of course set in a school environment this one takes place on a very magical place, Amagi Brilliant Park!\r\nStory - 8\r\nThe story is fairly simple yet entertaining, the main character Kanie is set out to save a amusement park from the brink of extinction.\r\nThere aren't really a lot of plot twists and unexpected events but that doesn't mean thestory is bad.\\n\r\nSometimes the process alone of seeing people come together and overcome harsh trials is heartwarming, Amagi Brilliant Park did a great job at presenting that.\\n\r\nThe only complaint here is that the last episode isn't actually part of the main plot, so for those of you who don't like OVA you can just skip it if you want, as the anime's ending is actually ep. 12.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nOh it's the part where we talk about Kyoto animation's art again, I mean are there really any explanations needed here? The art is very refreshing, the colors are vibrant and exciting, the characters feel much more alive than those of any other anime. The art just feels like it's on another level. In short, Kyoani's art is love, Kyoani's art is life.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Amagi Brilliant Park wasn't anything particularly special or very memorable, but it did achieve what it was made for, it set the mood very well and didn't stand out too much. I think a 7 is justified here as I think an 8  or higher should only be given to music that touches your heart.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\nI really liked how the main character Kanie seemed reluctant at first, but quickly makes up his mind because of the dire situation the park is in and the consequences it has if the park breaks down. This really shows that deep down Kanie is actually a very good person, that tsundere side of him makes me go cringe in joy. What slightly disappointed me was that you don't get to see a lot about Sento, the girl that lured the savior in. Other characters played a very comical part and were very entertaining to watch, my fav was definitely Tiramie.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nEven though this anime is not a masterpiece by any means, I still got a lot of enjoyment out of it. The comedy was great and made me breath more air out of my nose numerous amount of times. Even though the ending wasn't anything out of expectation, I was still quite touched by the moment.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is definitely recommended for people that like comedy, the anime also contains a slight bit of drama but I'd say the comedy in this show is worth the most. For those of you who are perverted and like fanservice, there is some of that as well but luckily not enough to overpower the anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nnote: I didn't spell check so there might be some mistakes.",

When Isuzu Sento a transfer student invites Seiya to an amusement park named Amagi Brilliant Park, he's reluctant. She \"convinces\" him by pointing a gun at him... so he agrees. Seiya and Sento go on there \"date\" at the park which is a run down, shabby looking joint. The only area looked after is the castle which captivates Seiya. Seiya investigates and meets Latifah Fleuranza, the princess of Maple Land who kisses him and bestows upon an ability to hear what people arethinking with a limit of only being able to hear each persons thoughts once (not explored much after 2nd episode).  Anyway Seiya learns that all the people working in the park are magical beings from Maple Land and that they require large amounts of people to come to the park in order to sustain there time on Earth, which is where Kanie comes in. Kanie becomes the Parks manager whose job is to bring in customers and reach a certain goal by the end of the year. Amagi Brilliant Park explores the magic of ones imagination with many challenges presented overcome by comedic sections and determination. \\n\\n\r\nThe musical score is very appropriate especially the opening  'Extra magic hour' which has a perfect rendition on the Piano (see Animenz Piano Sheets).  The story is unique with the animation art being beautiful. From someone who hasn't read the light novels or manga adaptations I found this series really enjoyable. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",

            "content": "I don't why people write long reviews a** reviews, cut down to the chase folks! Also, why is this anime rated a 7.72? This is a masterpiece! In my opinion.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nAlright, when it comes to story, it's cliche, but in a excellent way. Read the synopsis. It's there right? I don't read the synopsis anyways, but to summarize the synopsis from what I've just watched, Kanie-kun (main character) becomes the 'chosen one' to save the park  --> Sento (also main character) takes him to Amagi Brilliant Park --> shows him around the park as they are in a dire situation --> Kanie-kun is informedthat he has less than three months to save the park and has to reach 250,000 visitors by the end of July 31st to save the park. BAM! That's how the story starts.\\n\\n\r\n(By the way, do not drop this anime because of episode 1. Things will start to pick up, I promise.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP matched the tone of this anime, as there was everything you can expect from the opening to the anime itself. The OP could never have done better. The ED was also great as well!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the background and character designs, this anime is best as what it does when it comes to that. To the background and to the character designs, they were indeed fun to look at. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s): 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters, there were a lot of characters. I mean, a lot. But each one of them were rememberable as each and every one of them had a quirky but unique and fun personality. Overall, this character lineup are the best I've seen in an anime. I loved all the characters in this anime. My favorite were Tiramie and Macaron, and you'll see why. Also, some of the characters names are reference to rappers, and you'll also see why. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime from beginning to end! Enjoyed the anime, OVAs, and specials. I binged watched it in one day. I definitely recommend this anime for everyone to watch!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThe story may be cliche, but it's uniqueness and creativity is what makes this anime never seen before. The art is excellent as you'll never get tired looking at the screen! The background to character designs are colorful and fun to look at. Your eyes will always be attached to the screen from beginning to end. Once you reached the end of an episode, you'll be wanting some more. The music is catchy and light-hearted as it does not get tiring to hear. You'll have a fun time learning from each of the characters personalities as each and one of them have sense of humor. You'll find each character is lovable as the story progress on. Most importantly, my enjoyment of this anime was a fun ride, as I never got bored watching this anime. Binged watched it from beginning to end. Also, give the OVAs and specials a shot as well! Amagi Brilliant Park, is indeed a brilliant park. Once, you'll reach the end of this anime series however, you'll be begging for more! Truly a masterpiece!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. By the way, expect fan service on its way during the first two episodes in the beginning of the anime. Just a heads up!\\n\\n\r\nP.S.S. Also, expect lots of innuendoes and adult humor in this anime! \\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm here to give credit where credit is due. \r\nAnd... to not give credit where it isn't due.\r\nI believe that some anime have a couple flaws but that doesn't mean it's entirely out of the picture. Examples would be bad Character, Story, Art, Sound, etc.\r\nSome anime like this one, lack in the character and story department but EXCEL in the art and sound department.\r\nWhy don't I elaborate a bit more?\r\n[Story] 5/10 - While the anime starts off with a bunch of questions, it really does take its sweet damn time to develop a story worth getting into. In fact it uses a cheap tactic toget the viewer to care more near the end of the series, but said tactic is used in a lot of different anime so I can't be too picky about it. \\n\r\nIf you are going to establish stakes or consequences you gave to do it early or the actions and decisions the characters make wont well make a difference.\\n\r\nThere are very small moments in this anime where the main character is trying to decide on something at a meeting or attempting to figure out a solution to a problem. These scenes are fantastic! Not only do they show well character! They show his unscene or unread thoughts, which can make a difference in writing a compelling story.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] 10/10 - This is a prime example of giving credit where it is due! The art/animation is amazing. Is it the best thing I've ever seen? No. Not by a long shot, but it's still really good! The creativity in the animators really shows in this anime. Having a very diverse cast of characters, each with their own cute little design and uniqueness to them. Even the side characters who get around 20 seconds of screen time per episode, have a unique design that fits their character. \\n\r\nThe animation is really nice too! It's very smooth and rarely choppy.\\n\r\nBackgrounds and scenes are just gorgeous too. Especially when they are the focal point for some scenes!\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 9/10 - Minus a fairly okay OP the sound design is pretty good. It fits a fantasy world, it fits the amusement park vibe. The music rarely distracted me, in fact there is only one scene that completely took me out of the mood. Other than these minor complaints there really isn't much else to say. Only thing I can think of is that the ED was damn good.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 5/10 - This goes hand in hand with the story. A lot went wrong here and it's pretty obvious went made it go wrong. The main characters are flat and boring... They rarely even change and at the end of the character arcs it left me feeling empty. Now there is nothing wrong with having a few flat characters but when your main character is flat and so is the supporting lead it makes scenes where their characteristic would help with some comedy or even convey a specific thought or emotion, fall flat on the ground, all bones are broken, hospitalized permanently bad. I don't know if this was on purpose or that they just didn't design characters correctly? It's still a mystery to me. \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 8/10 - Like most comedies, they don't require an intersting story to be funny. This anime gave me a few laughs and inspired many memes from certain characters having completely different faces than they usually do. I had fun watching it.\\n\r\nDo I recommend this? Yep!\\n\r\nWhy? It is a great show to watch with friends, due to it's weirdness and wackiness factor. \\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 7.5/10 - Not a perfect, not a bad, not a great. but just plain good. If you want a comedy anime pick this up! I (95%) guarantee that you'll like it! \\n\\n\r\nIf today is your Birthday, Happy Birthday!\\n\r\nHave a wonderful rest of your day everyone!",

The show is basically a guy trying to save a runned down theme park as the story progresses you understand why the theme park needs to be saved which was actually quite sad. All in all the story kept me hooked because of how funny it actually was from the dirty jokes to the funny gags the show excelled in that area which is what it mainly is about.\r\nArt- notgonna get too much into this because most animes these days the art style kinda look the same not a knock on anything or anyone but this anime looks great visually.\\n\\n\r\nsound- T'was ok the music aside from the opening and ending didnt really hit me with a home run or anything just ok.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter- Funny characters since the theme of the anime was in a theme park there has to be many acts and different types of people running stations or performing acts and this anime really does good in that from the stupid funny characters the protective funny characters or just the funny characters in general its really good also to add the princess her character is kinda the generic cute nice kinda thing but her art design and her story is touching as it should.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment-  i liked it because i needed something really funny not stressful to watch and that had a decent story that makes you invested in the story although it didnt need the 13th episode.... i enjoyed it a lot one of the better anime i've seen and enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\noverall- 8/10 funny just quite funny not relateable for obvious reasons but the entire show from start to finish was a great ride id watch it again if i had time \\n",

Though it lacks in the romance department which would've made this a much better anime.\r\nHowever, this anime still manages to amaze and please you. It's not doubt, a good anime to watch and you won't regret picking it up.\r\nThe story is somewhat simple, get 250,000 visitors to the park before the deadline. The methods and such are what's truly amazing and hilarious. As Kanie (protagonist) tries to build up the park's reputation, he finds himself in allsorts of trouble and comedic situations.\\n\r\nThe characters are really funny, especially the mascots. Though, I didn't like them, they managed to make me laugh everytime the show up.\\n\r\nSo, in total, this anime is a comedy one. It's got no romance whatsoever. Yeah, there may be hints but it's not built on and left as it is.\\n\r\nBut, this is a really good anime of this fall and I hope you'll have as much fun watching it as I have.\\n",

At this point, she blatantly threatens to kill Kanie if he doesn't take her out on a date to the dilapidated amusement park, Amagi Brilliant Park. Turnsout the park really is a wreck, and Isuzu actually works there as assistant manager. This is when she pleads Kanie to help save the park from being shut down in a few months\u2019 time by becoming its new manager. A skeptical, but curious Kanie reluctantly agrees, and the true story of Amagi Brilliant Park begins. \\n\\n\r\nTo call this anime not funny, not original, and not entertaining is a blight on humanity. Throughout the whole anime, I was never bored or annoyed once. Every episode is unique and enthralling, and all of the major-minor characters get decent amounts of attention and screen time, and they're all (for the most part) pretty likable. \\n\\n\r\nSeiya Kanie, the main protagonist, is a stuck up but really intellectual jerk with an ego who would \"fall for me if I could,\" [Episode 1, to himself]. But his ego is one of the few things that actually make him likable and offers a breath of fresh air from your usual run-of-the-mill protagonists. To help save Amagi Brilliant Park, he becomes a pseudo-dictator that prioritizes the park amongst all else. Most episodes deal with the implementation of one of his plans to improve the park, and ultimately attract more guests. However, most of these plans rarely go without miscellaneous hitches, and that's where the fun and puns begin!\\n\\n\r\nBy himself though, the anime would have been a flop. Accompanying him in the anime is a wide assortment of colorful characters, ranging from Moffle the battle-ready mouse, Macaron the uninspired sheep, and Tirami the perverted Pomeranian dog. Among these characters are the last two main characters, the gun toting Isuzu Sento and the lovely princess of Amagi, Latifah Fleuranza. Although both of these characters are extremely likable, both could have used some more development, along with Kanie himself. Character development is one of the series\u2019 shortcomings, but for a simple Comedy, this isn\u2019t a huge issue. \\n\\n\r\nArt style wise, I felt like it could have been more a bit more vibrant and energetic for an anime centered around a theme park. It can feel dull at times, but most of the time I found myself laughing too hard to even care. This anime also completely NAILS facial expressions, like wholly sheet man. From the rape faces of the kids to the evil grins of the mascots, I haven\u2019t seen expressions this funny since Noragami. It\u2019s also worth noting this last episode went above and beyond their normal standard art, and created a truly breath taking scene, and according to MAL, we have yet another episode incoming!\\n\\n\r\nSound wise, it\u2019s nothing really special. Don\u2019t come in expecting an Aldnoah Zero or Madoka Magica level OST, but it\u2019s just good enough to compliment it for being effective when it needs to be. \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t already guessed, Amagi Brilliant Park is one of the funniest animes I, and most of my friends have ever seen! If you\u2019re a Comedy lover, you have no excuse not to watch this. If you\u2019re a fan service lover, you also have no excuse to not watch this (but even if you dislike fanservice, there\u2019s just enough to not become annoying). Overall, I just can\u2019t recommend this anime enough, both for the original idea and the ultimately miscellaneous adventures of the cast of Amagi Brilliant Park :)\\n",

First to twelve was an amazing development but episode 13, it shotme down due to the fact of the 12 being a great finale and making an ep 13 as a special? They should just turn that into an ova for ep 13. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: Kyoto Animation's artwork\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: \"Look at the sky is magical!\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: If you watch it, you know how they are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10: Much delight, quite a good story and good humors to clear off my stress after my big exams last year which is the O'levels.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "How come Kyoto Animation hasn't figured it out by now?\r\nTheir success has almost exclusive stern from adaption, hell their name was revered because of their adaptions.\r\nTheir own writers are horrendous. Dialogues are clunky and confusing, lacking in meaning and intention. It's so shit it stick out like a giant tree in the middle of the lake when it comes to drama. Chuuni has been somewhat saved by the ridiculous action scene and actually having a writer doing some works to that. Tamago Market suffered greatly and even Kyoukai no Katana is pretty bad when it comes to that. The fact that the works that theyeither make themselves or thought that it was good have been shit and done much to damage their reputation seems to have finally made them realized their weakness.\\n\r\nI digress, Amagi Brilliant Park.\\n\r\nIf there's a source material that play to Kyoto Animation strength then this one is probably one of the best out there: not out right comedy nor drama, a mixture of both is where their magic comes. They have a really good sense of \"moe\" (creeps me to say the word) and understand how to build into that sense in a character. All the character from the source materials were build such that they retained their likability and even further with the choice of voice acting. The story premise is simple: Girl, Park, Bet, Win. Since there isn't a lot to dwell on Kyoto Ani has the advantage again, their character building has always been really easy to swallow. The way that the characters are slowly delivered to you instead of info dumping (thanks to the source material somewhat) is what Kyoto Animation do best when they have no need to write the dialog themselves and instead focusing on directing, pacing and music. Other than characters, comedy is another aspect of Kyoto Ani that has helped them in the past and it was also shown here. While not being outright laugh out loud, Kyoto Ani comedy always help lighten the mood of the story somewhat and still give a sense that they are adding to the plot. Most of the comedy ties with the characterization so rarely it becomes nonsensical although this could also largely be thanks to the source material\\n\r\nKyoto Ani art is rarely a weakness although in this case they seem to be unable to cheat by using real location so various points in the show has stark contrast to the detailed environment of other places. They probably had this coming although to be fair, creating a believable location is extremely difficult. Believe me because I tried environmental design and to create a life like location it could take months just to make one. Character design is hard to argue or distribute points due to the design is already made by the source material although judging by the work Kyoto Ani made on them it is quite well done but I am somewhat dissatisfy with Sento due to her stiff image, not what I imagine but I guess that is closer to the source material.\\n\r\nIn terms of sound this one left quite a small impact. The sound has always been Kyo Ani both good and bad point. Their soundtrack is rarely fantastic but always up to standard. It always fits the show really well but seems like it was made for the show rather than made by the artist. This always set the good one and the great one apart, although I am not sure which one is ultimately better though as I have my Haruhi soundtrack from them since forever because it is just really really good. \\n\r\nI would recommend this if you are an avid Kyo Ani fan but saying that is utterly pointless. For people who are quite new this show is not a bad choice to get into Kyo Ani stuffs. Their stuffs are often quite similar to this except for their older endeavor before they sell their soul to the devil called merchandise. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to look beyond this show read below\\n\r\nNow onto the larger point I made before. Kyo Ani is shit especially when it comes to things they make their own and so this one capacity for memorable   moments is actually not beyond calculation. Honestly though after this I am confused as to what their confidence would be. Would their confidence rose and they continue to try pushing their own creativity forward or would they understand their limitation (particularly in the directing department) and go back to adaption, something that have propel them into the air. Though it might be because of Tatsuya Ishihara that shows were good but this one is pretty nice in itself so I still believe they do have talents for reading and understanding comedy drama adaption. Another thing to point out about Ishihara is that whenever he's not there their success is mostly from comedy heavy stuffs so maybe there's a slight pattern. Their recent Euphonium is quite nice so I hope they are back on track with adaptions. I do miss their Key adaptions very much because after them the other Maeda adaptions sometime left a little and in some case a lot left to desire while their partnership always manage a full course meal that for some reason I just can't rewatch. Their next one is from their own publication so chances are actually 25-75 but I ll take it because it's Ishihara again.",

If you want a plot oriented story so sorry you might not find one it takes much more of an episodic approach of story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:- 8/10, one of the strongest part of the whole anime the colour scheme is refreshing and very vibrant, a mixture of vibgyor  you'll feel like its a canvas painting in motion, excellent artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound:- 8/10, the good thing is voice acting is not compromised and fits the characters, it is extremely well done, the voices suit the characters and i can say i couldnt find a moment where the voice did not sync in with the characters lip sync.The background score is very much like that of a  typical comic anime, so i would say it was pretty decent and the opening just sets up a lively atmosphere, and piques your interest.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:-10/10, the thing that made this anime for me was the character to character interaction, all the charcaters are extremely loveable, the mc kanae(name derived from kanye west), is exactly like his 3D version, if you know what i mean he is a brat who purs himself in high esteem but after half the anime he shows a more bright side.He is a hell of an interesting man, moreover more of the mascots are damn brats extremely funny and interesting,excellent development, and moreover gotta love latifa and the female lead (whose name i forgot, sorry).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:- 8/10, well to summarize it is one hell of a fun ride, this is one of the greatest comedies ive ever stumbled on, the comedic element is just so high, this is a must watch if ur looking for a light watch.\\n\\n\r\nARIGATO GUZAIMASU!!!!, hope you like it, if you have any suggestions how i can make my reviews better you are free to tell....till the n saionara",

But then again it's a kind of anime that isn't nor epic nor bad, it's average in most ways except the characters, which I found great. The whole theme was interesting and the story didn't lack the explosive elements, but there was something that was missing for the big boom. It's like the story doesn't make you want to live in that world even with the amazing creatures that inhabit it. \r\nAll in all it is a decent anime to watch, and I would recommend it to people who enjoy a comedic,yet heroic main hero. Kane-kun fulfills the role of the anti hero rather good, and I must say I enjoyed him as character.\\n\\n\r\nThat all being said, I, like always, will keep it short and say, it's an anime worth watching due to the following factors:\\n\r\nGood Characters\\n\r\nSuperb Art\\n\r\nGood Sound \\n\r\nA decent story with unique features, but not so connected\\n\r\nNice comedy\\n\\n\r\nThe Negatives were:\\n\r\nSome huge plot holes\\n\r\nNot a clear ending (I am hopeful for a season 2), yet somehow they managed to rush it.\\n\r\nIt seems like there are too many important side characters, whos story isn't shown.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my review, have a nice day.",

Along the episodes you might found bits of important stories scattered in between the dialogues, which is quite an easter egg for plot-chasers.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nAs expected from KyoAni, the art was well made, even the side characters have an amazing art design. The animation and art was nice and well fitted with the nuance.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nPersonally it was a good OP and ED, also the timing for claps at the OP really got me.\r\nCharacter: 8/10\r\nThis anime has alot of characters which is why it is going to be hard to see any developments of the characters throughout the story. But this anime actually manages it, there is a development in the characters, although only the main chars, and also this anime also has a lot of unique personalities in there to add in their comical gags.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you like light comedy, then I'd say you will found a good amount of enjoyment in it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nTl;dr This is a lighthearted anime with a shallow plot, amazing arts, and centered around its comedy.

            "content": "\"Amagi Brilliant Park\" is an anime produced in 2014 by Kyoto Animation and based on the homonymous light novel written by Shoji Gatoh and illustrated by Yuki Nakajima. The series has thirteen episodes, to which is added an OVA published in 2015.\r\nThe story sees Seiya Kanie as a protagonist, a high school student with a brief career in the entertainment world behind him. One day he is threatened with a musket by his classmate Isuzu Sento, who forces him to give her an appointment. The chosen location for the exit is Amagi Brilliant Park, an amusement park on the verge of bankruptcy. Unexpectedly, the princessof the \"Land of Maple\", Latifah Fleuranza, asks the boy to assume the role of director and to save the park from the imminent closure.\\n\r\nOne of the essential points of the success of an entrepreneurial activity is surely made up of human resources: the amusement park staff, thick and heterogeneous, will therefore be the subject of a general deepening, accompanied by a certain renewal of everyone's habits and way of working characters. The four fairies of the Elementary, for example, will learn to collaborate and improve their harmony, or the beautiful Isuzu, cold and indifferent, will begin to open up and do her best for the good of the park. Excellent work on the protagonist: the charismatic Seiya, while retaining the typical narcissism that distinguishes him, will begin to show less apathy towards what is happening around him. But the strong point of the characters is, in my opinion, represented by Moffle, Macaron and Tiramy: endowed with strong personalities that are completely out of place with their adorable appearance, the three mascots play a key role within the comic side of the anime.\\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Amagi Brilliant Park\" is a light and pleasant soul, which lets itself be looked at and appreciated. The screenplay does not present any original or striking developments, nor do the characters bear an important psychological introspection. However, the sympathy of the latter, a good amount of hilarious gags and a very pleasant graphic section for the eyes can give the viewer a cheerful and little committed vision.\\n\r\nPretty music, cute ending. The opening deserves a lot! It is truly beautiful and full of rhythm and life.\\n\r\nThe cast of the duplicators is excellent: Kouki Uchiyama breaks through giving his voice to the protagonist and Ayako Kawasumi, the famous Saber of \"Fate\", gives us an amusing and amusing interpretation. If you believe that Uchiyama did his best with Tsukishima of \"Haikyuu !!\" or Yurio of \"Yuri on Ice\", you are mistaken: in my opinion, Kanie Seiya's is her best performance and her voice fits him divinely. The seiyuu of the prefecture of Saitama manages to give the protagonist an energetic, lively and amusing tone: hearing to believe.\\n\r\nThe designs are excellent, the Kyoto Animation never disappoints: attention to detail, excellent proportions, many vivid colors and fabulous backgrounds are magical ingredients and excellent for our eyes.",

A lot of the same jokes hurled over and over, few enough interesting characters to carry a comedy, and not particularly interesting enough scenarios to create a memorable situation comedy. \r\nAmagi Brilliant Park, in my opinion, just seems tofall short. It has a lot of potential. Like the main character, Kanie Seiya, and Isuzu Sento, are potentially good characters. It's just... nothing is done with them. And their romantic relationship for that matter really doesn't go anywhere either. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is fine, I love the opening. \\n\\n\r\nArt is FANTASTIC. \\n\\n\r\nBut honestly, walking away from it, I'd just say I was pretty disappointed with basically how little they had to work with despite how much potential the premise held.",

            "content": "To be honest, I only knew about the series when a certain club used it as a cover. Then I got curious and found it. At first, I thought ti would be another slice of life anime, since it's kyoani and everything, but I was wrong. There were so many things in this series that got me hooked.\r\nLet's start off with the plot. Normally, anime protagonists would be shy, timid, normal, etc. But the MC for Amagi was different. Instead of going with the typical normal character, they went with a narcissistic smartass. And that's a good thing, especially when the plot has magic involved.Most series would fail to bring magic and real life together because it often turns into action. But not this series. The concept of slice of life was still eminent. It's also because of this harmonious combination that the characters became memorable.\\n\\n\r\nNext off is the characters. Now you may argue that the MC is just a rip-off of another character from another kyoani anime, and I don't blame you. That's what I thought as well before I learned what kind of guy he really was. Next up is Sento. For some reason, when trying to figure out her personality, I thought she was the typical cold-hearted beauty. Boy, I was wrong. Actually, she was more human than other cold-hearted beauties out there. She also had her own set of weaknesses, but that's what makes a character real. I'd like to talk about the other characters, but if I did, this review would be too long.\\n\\n\r\nAnother category that caught my eye was the soundtrack. Usually, as long as I saw an anime, I wouldn't give a damn to the BGM. But this series broke that habit. The music blended well with the atmosphere of each scene, all the while maintaining the amusement park feel of it.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to talk about the art style, but it's kyoani, so there's really nothing to say that hasn't been said yet.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was an enchanting anime. IT was cute and relaxing but also tension-building. I recommend this anime very much if you're tired of all the shounen magic power cliche.You're just one step away from experiencing the magic of Amagi brilliant park!",

I absolutely enjoyed this one. I almost missed it because the thumbnail of it didn't interest me, but I was bored one day and glad I clicked on it. This park is insane, the attractions, the people, holy crap the amusement park faires are a wreck. You have the grumpy old mouse, a perverted cat and then a sheep that loves to blow up shit, or was it the cat, either way, each personality ofthe characters were great. I really did hate how it didn't give us more information of the curse and more information of everyone else. Great comedy show if you're in for some laughter and weirdness.",

            "content": "I'll attempt to make an effort and write reviews of the anime I watched this year I guess. First review coming up.\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park (AmaBuri) is a story of Kanie Seiya, a student who is full of himself, is asked (forced) to run a dying theme park by Sento Isuzu. I won't elaborate - that's what the synopsis is for.\r\nStory :\r\nThe concept of this story is pretty unique. It is pretty episodic, in the sense that each episode is an arc of it's own (mostly) and you get comedic moments throughout the show that isn't really repetitive or boring, it's decent. Each arc also focuseson the park members and developing them, as well as the Main Characters, Kanie and Sento. Overall the pacing is good and the focus of saving the park is kept intact.\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\r\nThe art is pretty. It's not too jarring, and it has it moments where an episode seems to have a higher budget than another, but overall it's good.\\n\\n\r\nSound : \\n\r\nThe opening and ending tracks aren't bad, they were catchy when I was listening to them the first few times, but not enough for me to be absolutely addicted. The soundtracks fits the show well. None of them really stood out, but they were good nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\r\nThe character development was good, and as mentioned above, each supporting character was developed well in the own story arc. We also got to see Kanie's growth as a person, as he gets more mature with the way he interacts with the other characters by the end. Minor Spoiler : His ego is still ridiculously high. Sento got developed well as well, seeing as she was sort of an airhead at the beginning, using her gun more than her mouth but she realized that you shouldn't point guns at people if you're running a theme park.\\n\r\nMy problem was with Latifa. MAL lists her as a main character, but I felt that she wasn't developed very well. She has her moments, but she was mostly there as the ex-manager of the park. This caused the end of her character arc to be pretty abrupt in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nThis anime isn't a must watch on everybody's list, but to anyone who likes comedy anime, you would probably enjoy it. I certainly enjoyed it and I think the ending was well done as well\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would rate Amagi Brilliant Park 8/10\\n\r\nI hope my first review was not too bad, and thanks for reading!",

            "content": "If you're looking for an anime with a riveting plot and/or characters, I suggest you turn right around and look somewhere else. \r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is another anime from KyoAni, and while I can't say it was terrible, it did little to stand out from any other title this season. It seems to have a little of some things, but they never went all the way. Take, for example, the romance. Although it was heavily implied, nothing actually happened. Comedy... passable, but I've seen better. The story and plot were fairly interesting. A broke and failing park that needs to reach a certain quota tostay afloat, and of course fantasy is mixed into all of it. Personally, I think it would've been more interesting if there wasn't magic, seeing as the main reason they included it was for Latifa and her situation. \\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to the characters. Mediocre, at best. I had high hopes for them from watching the first episode. I absolutely fell in love with Kanie and his narcissistic personality. I was even hoping to see more into his backstory, but that didn't really happen as well as I thought. In fact, I believe the reason so many characters had such little background to them was due to the story trying to focus on all of them at once and then failing to explore deeply enough. \\n\\n\r\nArt, as per usual, was wonderful. The opening was wonderfully preppy and cherry, something that was reflected in the anime most of the time. The ending was a fair bit calmer, but still good. \\n\\n\r\nAs a last note, one things that especially irritated me was how they took the last episode and made it a filler. The anime should've ended at episode 12. It was not only the climax of the events occuring before it, but it ended on a open and positive note. It was perfect. In fact, just after watching it I was confused as to why there was 13 episodes listed. And then I watched episode 12. It contributed nothing to the storyline other than \"a day in their life\" after the climax. Very disappointing. \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: Want something complex and interesting? This isn't the anime for you. If you're simply looking for something to pass the time, go ahead and watch it!",

            "content": "TL;DR Amagi Brilliant Park is a stupendous anime that was a rollercoaster of good times versus edge-of-the-seat suspense. Although it did have its fair share of flaws, they were overshadowed by the sound of my laughter and the smile on my cheeks.\r\n Story: 7\r\nThe story is unusual to say the least. Magical creatures led by teenage boy to save an amusement park from shutting down. However, the outrageous plot and the exaggerated over-the-top characters bring the story to life with a joke for everyone, regardless of age. The episodes are handled well with a \"spotlight\" theme of bringing each character and their personality/history on stage.As well the story still remains focused on the impeding danger of their situation whether it be lack of visitors, funds, or other motives. Although we recognize the drama and grave nature of the park and its inhabitants, Amagi Brilliant Park does not become overwhelmed by its plot and does not appear forced, a difficult feat to pull off. The audience never loses sight of their circumstances and is able to empathize with their victories and failures to achieve their goals. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is anything to reprimand Amagi Brilliant Park, it would be that there are some plot holes and loose ends as the story's background makes an appearance. Additionally the actions of the characters can seem somewhat indecisive in nature, temporally losing impact of what they have done. However, it is not only the characters who come off as \"wishy-washy\" but also parts of the plot which seem to be out of place or too forgiving, losing the gravity of failure and consequence. Many of these shortcomings can be attributed to the 13 episode count, which when taken into consideration can allow these flaws to be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nKyoto animation does it again. Unlike many other studios, Kyoto animation's quality is for the most part consistent and recognizable. Art is appealing to the eye and well defined. The characters look alive and the few panorama shots we do receive are nothing short of gorgeous. Although I feel that additional details could be added to make the background sharper and more distinct, no objective complaints can be made about Amagi Brilliant Park's animation nor its graphical quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park's soundtrack is well done and runs smoothly for the most part. Songs performed by the Elementario in particular strike as memorable and honestly quite catchy. Background effects and emotional triggered songs are for the most part accurate to the scene at hand, however some reused tracks feel somewhat off from the feelings that they are trying to convey. \\n\\n\r\nSide Note: The Elementario song is called Subarashiki FUN!TASY. Thank me later :).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nDue to the brevity of the 13 episode series, we are not able to fully explore the characters to their fullest potential. As soon as character backstories are told, the anime has to switch gears to remain on track with the plot. However, character development is still very apparent and involves the characters overcoming the prejudices of one another for the sake of a greater goal, or coming to terms with the character's faults with subsequent growth. Each persona is unique and keeps the audience engaged. Despite appearances, the none of the characters can be classified to anything truly generic, a breath of fresh air for many seasoned anime viewers. Even static individuals can be entertaining by being placed in funny circumstances which keeps the show fresh and inventive. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised by Amagi Brilliant Park. I came for a comedic thrill ride and was not disappointed. Even I laughed more than I would admit. The personalities sold the show and kept my eyes glued to the screen, especially on what Macaron and Tiramie would scheme up next. Any personal nitpicks of mine would likely be that I was left hungry for more after the series came to an end. I felt attached to the characters and would have wished for more time to get to know them over the 3 month park timespan. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park serves as testament that drama and over-the-top elements can blend in harmony. To anyone still on the edge of watching the show, come for the story and stay for the laughs!\\n\\n\r\nRecommended?: Yes\\n\\n\r\nRewatched?: Yes",

            "content": "Amagi Brilliant Park is a very good anime that never quite reaches its goal. It has all the elements of a great anime, but fails in certain areas that can't be redeemed - no matter how hard they try.\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is an anime about a guy named Seiya Kanie, who is tasked with becoming the manager of a park and bringing in 500,000 guests by a certain date. During the course of his stay at the park, he meets various characters and comedy ensues. \r\nThis comes from Kyoto Animation, and like most of their work, the animation is top notch. Nearly every single sceneseems like a painting. I couldn't help but admire the attention to detail, especially in the opening credits. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, Kyoto Animation once again succeeds with a awesome soundtrack that fits the series well. It's fun, poppy, and warming. In particular, the OP is phenomenal and definitely ranks in my top 10 opening credits songs of all time. It feels as if you're going on a rollercoaster and at the end is the start of an episode. It gets you in the right mood. \\n\\n\r\nThe real downfall of the series is the story. It's painfully boring and uninteresting. Since Amagi Brilliant Park is only 13 episodes long, everything felt rushed and uninspired. Before watching this anime, I didn't really have a clear picture of what it was about. I was hoping it would be a slice of life anime that follows a group of characters who work at an amusement park. But no, Kyoto Animation had to add this dull story, which I'm sure is part of the source material. Drama is sprinkled throughout the series due to the story. Sadly, it just doesn't work. I never felt scared or worried for any of the characters. I knew that, without a shadow of a doubt, things would end up in a positive light for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they are pretty weak. The main character, Seiya, changes overtime as you would think. He starts off weak and becomes a stronger character due to his predicament. Isuzu, who is the girl that brings Seiya to the park in the first place, never changes. The way she is presented when we first see her is how she stays for the rest of the anime. There's also a princess character, Latifah, who doesn't really do much of anything. She has a bit of a backstory and the plot is kind of connected to her, but I never felt like she was an important character. There are other human characters as well, but none of them have any real depth. The only characters I felt truly connected with were the mythical creatures who worked at the park. They were fun and had a ton of personality. Whenever they came on screen, I knew things were going to be at least a tad bit enjoyable. Also, a \"villain\" is introduced in the series later on. He kind of appears and then vanishes and we never see him again. Not sure why Kyoto Animation even bothered putting him into the show at all. He's useless and not threatening at all. Perhaps the villain has a bigger role in the source material. \\n\\n\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park isn't bad by any means. The humor is well done and goes at a fast pace (for the most part). But again, the unneeded story and weak main characters keep this show from being another Kyoto Animation masterpiece.",

            "content": "It sounds simple, maybe even boring for whoever imagines it might be a serious series among others in Fall season. You can always find it either funny or silly, such enjoyable full of laughter series to relieve your stress without sweep your logic away, because here we can also feel the suppressors are on its way. Citizens of magical realm called Maple Land are living their life in a poor amusement park, alienated by visitors and organized badly, the only reason that make all of the citizens / staffs here still do the job is because all of the staffs need magical power in orderto live, and the method to get the magical power is created by happiness of man having fun in their park.\\n\r\n    The park is in critical state which needs dozens of visitors to make it keep alive, otherwise it will be changed hands as a provision if the amount of visitor insufficient. To save the park from closing, Seiya is hired by the owner, Latifa Fleuranza--the princess of Maple land-- (whom Seiya met before when he was a young boy) to be a new manager, and help Amagi Brilliant Park to overcome the needed visitors, around 250,000 visitors in 3 months.\\n\r\n[somewhat SPOILER] Kanie gets an ability to know what's on person's mind after his doubt to Latifa made this princess gave him the ability by her magic power. Behind all of this (already) serious matter, later found that the life of Latifa-sama, the Highness in this park, is on the line as well as the park. Summary, to save the park means to save Latifa-sama's life too. Latifa Fleuranza always be a 14 years old girl, memory erased after a year on Aug 1st due to the curse she got from a witch that betrayed by Latifa's father promise to be able marrying Latifa when she was child.\\n\\n\r\n    Pretty much the brief summary of story is explained, the plot and the tasks they need to be done in a short time is all about how to attract guests to their lovely home, or say amusement park. One by one, every lil possibility they use intellectually, sharply, elegantly, to achieve their only goal 'til the end of July. Even if on every eps we will force to face the new problems and find the solution, the show is succeed to bring joy. It's also helped by the characters.\\n\\n\r\n    Not much characterization is involved here, the involvement is wholly centered on the park itself by the characters or the staffs of Amagi Brilliant Park. Let me name Moffle, Tiramie, and Macaron, these mascots that leave such impressions, like trio clown they are freaking funny. No need to worry the show has enough unique female characters, Sento Isuzu, Latifa Fleuranza, and the Elementario. They are the center of story, a fateful encounter of main hero, Seiya Kanie, and the park workers, their secrets indeed a serious matter but those are all brought up with millions of laughs.\\n\\n\r\n    I'm pleased by the visualization, bright and vivid color, firm line and nice body curve, delight scenes as if it's a real amusement park. It even makes the abandoned park seems well-maintained, it's just how it was organized badly.\\n\\n\r\n    In a long time I haven't heard steady beat and pumping heart theme songs, and found Amagi Brilliant Park OP song is catchy enough, sung by AKINO with bless4 \"Extra Magic Hour (\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30fb\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30a2\u30ef\u30fc)\". The ED song is an average but the scenes are beau, \"Elementario de Aimashou (\u30a8\u30ec\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30ea\u30aa\u3067\u4f1a\u3044\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046)\" by BRILLIANT4 (seiyuus of Sylphy, Cobori, Salma, & Muse)\\n\\n\\n\r\n    The meaning of this show by point out hard work, hope and even just a small achievement makes me stuck in amazement. They really put their best, brainstorming so hard, grab any possible outcomes to make it better. The show is 7.5 for me~\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nNice visualization \u0669( \u275b \u25bf \u275b)\u06f6 \\n\r\nFunny jokes and characters\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nI can't decide whether it's episodic or not but...feels episodic for me. Like solve a prob or case will lead to the next stage. Quite natural, but still...episodic",

            "content": "After not having seen any anime for a rather long while due to a very horrible sickness basically making both my head and ears as useless as those on a deaf-mute in an insane asylum, I was hungry for a comedy anime to help me take my mind of my health-related worries.\r\nSo I had decided to watch Nanatsu no Taizai (The Seven Deadly Sins). Five episodes in, I had to stop watching because, apparently, I\u2019d forgotten to download episodes 6 and 7. Then I got really mad with myself for that colossal mess-up which I couldn\u2019t readily fix because, well, my internet had the downs.\r\nNaturally,the hunger hadn\u2019t been sated so I began sniffing through all the other numerous folders in my PC where I could have downloaded an anime by accident and forgotten to watch it. Finally, I had managed to find Amagi Brilliant Park (along with its special episodes) in a folder containing Shoujo manga\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAh, so I was hankering for a comedy manga. Yes! That\u2019s right. Nanatsu no Taizai was coming along fine but could Amagi Brilliant Park prove to be better in that field? Well, that\u2019s pretty much the only area where it excels.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see from the synopsis, Amaburi (short for the whole name) is basically about how a non-musical highschooler Kanye West is coaxed into helping the management of the Amagi Brilliant Park bring in 250,000 visitors to meet the year\u2019s 500,000 visitor quota or else the park would get shut down. That\u2019s it. There are no twists or other huge plot developments that will make you go, \u201cOOOoooooh kukukukuku! Naruhodo.\u201d (Oh, hehehe! I see.) It\u2019s just a straight-forward comedy about saving a failed business. If you want to give it funny title then \u2018Theme Park Tycoon: The Anime: The Adaptation\u201d will work quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a full-on comedy show, no two shits are giving about backgrounds of the people who work in the park. Most of the characters are from some magical Disneyland called \u2018Maple Land\u2019 and you\u2019re just expected to go with that. Hell, up till episode 6 I was still reluctant in accepting the \u2018magical beings\u2019 shtick because even Maple Land was treated as some recurring gag. Also, the tension created using plot devices pulled out of the arse of a rabbit in a top-hat doesn\u2019t really help much. They seem like episodic afterthoughts \u2013 not planned to be in the story and therefore being very cheap.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, what I\u2019m saying is that the concept of Amaburi is neat but the story is just a mess. If you\u2019re going in for the story then you\u2019re in for a huge disappointment because this Kyoto Animation work follows in the vein of \u2018K-On!\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, all I wanted from Amaburi was the funnies and I got it by the bucketfuls after the second episode when the jokes finally leave fan service territory. Hilarious skits about alcoholism; an episode in which Kanye falls sick and the three crazy mascot guys take turns filling in for him at school and making a huge love triangle fiesta, another episode where one of the mascots takes his trainees to an underground wrestling arena hosted by a kindergarten, and many weird skits involving references and mention of panties. I seriously needed the hard laughs provided by this show. Really made my day brighter. (I binged Amaburi).\\n\\n\r\nJust like any other comedy-focused anime, the characters of Amaburi belong in Dimension One. If someone\u2019s a perv, then he\u2019s likely to stay a pervert. Except for Tricen the Triceratops. He\u2019s a very well written perverted dinosaur. The only character that gets any actual development is Kanye the MC and, to be honest, he\u2019s the only one who deserves it seeing as this is a comedy and all.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, in my opinion, isn\u2019t anything special considering this is a KyoAni show. I need spectacularly beautiful cherry blossom petals and really smooth movement that\u2019ll make scenes from this show a frequent pick for AMVs. I\u2019m not saying the animation is bad \u2013 it\u2019s actually pretty good. I\u2019m just saying that KyoAni was just really tame with it and I don\u2019t like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe music\u2019s nothing special. Nothing to talk about here!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Amagi Brilliant Park gets a 7.25 out of 10 from me. If not for the story being literally all over the place and melodrama for the sake of melodrama, then this show could have been a smidge better. The scoring also largely suffers from the \u2018magical\u2019 ending which I really disliked. Still, it\u2019s a fun show for the lols. Watch it if you want to binge a comedy while waiting for someone.",

            "content": "Amagi Brilliant Parks' bright color palette, aura of delightful, happy charm, and exuberant welcoming nature drew me, an otherwise sullen, jaded, and grumpy individual towards it. But absorb these kinds of shows like a sponge and this was no exception. While it initially wasn't as testosterone driven as a comedy series like Gintama or Digagi Kashi, which is totally what I was expecting, Amagi Brilliant Park instead offers a more light novel approach without having to boast a great deal of noise and delivers a great deal of character.\r\nSTORY: I enjoy an anime that gives me the plot in a matter of minutes insteadof wasting 16 minutes of the first episode only to cram a cliffhanger conclusion that forces me to watch the next episode. I should WANT to because I'm enjoying what I'm watching, not forcing myself. What's great about the story of saving the park is the series establishes its goal right off the bat, so as a viewer, I'm immediately invested in this, and as more details follow about the importance of said plot, it makes me want to watch even more. I would go as far to say the journey to save Amagi Park is almost like watching a Kickstarter trying to reach its stretch goals, and that makes it fascinating. Each episode searches for a new way to draw more customers to the park, so I began to become more engaged and wanted ultimately for them to succeed. The frustration the cast exhibits when being pressured to overcome such insurmountable odds feels authentic. The stakes are very high for them to succeed, so when they begin to fight amongst themselves, it's justified. Most anime I watch just have the heroes bickering amongst themselves for no legit reason, other than to stretch the drama for as long as possible (Tiger & Bunny's second half was like trying to watch someone pedal a bicycle uphill through mud). SCORE: 7\\n\\n\r\nART: As noted, Brill Park's (as the kids call it) deep and enriching color palette makes it very easy on the eyes. One of the things I noticed immediately is the very large ensemble of...for lack of a better phrase...interesting character designs, including (and I can't make this up) a sentient 4 foot wrench, masked luchador security guards, and a passive, fire breathing dragon! The mascots, Moffle, Macaron, and Tirami, are incredibly adorable, though I admit, it took me about 5 episodes to figure out Tirami's gender. There's a lot of great things of various shapes and sizes to look at in Amagi, but I do have a major nitpick: the main character Sanie's overall design. Maybe it's just me, but I've just about had it with anime's short, messy, black-haired protagonists. When did this become the default look for male leads? I can't think of a more boring character template, and there's so many sporting this same look! Why not give me something interesting to look at, at least a different hair color? Sento, the female lead, is super busty and shapely, but I can't stop staring at her bangs. They look funny to me, as if an extra set of bangs overlap her original ones. \\n\r\n While Amagi's physical gags and jokes aren't anything I haven't seen in the last 11 years, they are kind of funny. I wished actually that it could've been a bit zanier and produced new jokes, but perhaps its more reserved approach can be appreciated. SCORE: 7\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: I can honestly say that Sanie is the kind of lead character the anime world benefits greatly from. \"Lead\" is the key word, because when the opportunity is presented to him to make a change, he accepts it with great aplomb. I had hoped that the series played more on his conceited and arrogant nature, Sanie is the perfect complete character that guides a cast of characters that are essentially schtick. That isn't particularly a knock on the cast for being shallow, but it's a little true. The crew members of Amagi Park are a little one note, Sanie and Moffle seem to be the only two dimensional personalities among the cast. Sanie's determination to create revenue for the park resonates throughout and he finds a way to be an inspiration for everyone. In some ways, I forgot he's a high schooler. Moffle, whose closest to Sento and Queen Lafita, is grizzled and discouraged. While he doesn't believe much in Sanie, he pushes onward, feeling the inevitability that the park is doomed. He's the only park member who wears his somber expression and he bears a great weight with the task at hand. Sento, on the other hand, as a female lead brings little to the show other than breasts and a small skirt. She has moments throughout, and her laconic, by-the-books attitude is something I've learned to appreciate over the years, but she's pretty much cosplay eye candy that would bring attention to the series that probably wouldn't look otherwise. Nothing wrong with a cute girl to promote your show. SCORE: 8\\n\\n\r\n IN CLOSING: Amagi Brilliant Park may not bring much new to the comedy anime table, but this show is incredibly enjoyable. Its large cast of bizarre and adorable characters, charming story, and precious conclusion makes this one of my favorite feel-good anime titles of modern times. A few things do kind of hold it back from being the treasure I think it could be (things probably explained in the manga), but this is a really good starter anime for anyone just getting into the genre. OVERALL SCORE: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPROS: A fantasic male lead. Loveable supporting cast. Straightforward story. The dramatic climax was worth a million bucks.\\n\\n\r\nCONS: Comedy feels reserved and predictable.",

            "content": "I'll start off this review with a quick note that harems have never really been my cup of tea. There's the occasional harem that deserves my attention, but most of them are just boring and generic, especially Kyoani harems. This is not one of those harems. For starters, I'm not even entirely sure I'd call this a harem, since not a lot of romance actually goes on and there's really only two female \"love interests,\" so it's more of a show that happens to have a high female:male ratio and a love triangle that's never really acted on, which is nice. This show is refreshingto say the least, since it has such a nice mix of charm, comedy, adult themes, and heartwarming moments that blend together into what Amaburi is.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe story is definitely something original, or at least I think so. Kanie Seiya is a narcissistic ex-child star with excellent reflexes and a sharp, witty attitude. One day he's dragged to a ratty old amusement park by his classmate Sento (at gunpoint, I might add) and is told that it is her beloved amusement park that she wishes to reconstruct so it may have more visitors and won't be in danger of shutting down. She believes Kanie is the key to making Amaburi a fun place again. From there, quite the plot twist happens, so I'll keep from going too in-depth with it, but it's a pleasant surprise that will make you want to keep watching.\\n\r\nAmaburi is semi-episodic, with each episode introducing a new problem that Kanie has to solve in order to save the park. However, there IS an underlying plot that keeps each episode moving with a goal, and it's a pretty fun ride getting to that goal (no pun intended).\\n\r\nThe only complaint I have with Amaburi's story is its habit of introducing plot points that seem pretty important but never picking them back up again. Kanie's career as a child star seems pretty important, but as the show goes on, you find yourself forgetting about it, since it's never relevant to the plot and never comes back up again. Some pros to the plot include its originality and its fun style of storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIt's Kyoani, what do you expect? Bright, fun colors. Smooth, swift animation. My only downgrade is the fanservice, which I have never been a fan of. It's not super in your face, but it's really not necessary either, and takes away a lot of good screen time that could've been used for something else.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThis show's OP and ED are incredible. They fit the mood of the show perfectly; heartwarming, fun, and leaving you wanting more. Along with that, the OST in-show is also beautiful, and no music seems to be out of place or forgetful. Definitely a fine OST, no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThis was sort of a tough choice, as I considered giving it an 8, but I found myself wanting to grade this criteria a little harsher. The MC is a fun character, since he actually has a personality, unlike so many Kyoani/harem male leads. His character is one of the most fun I've seen in a while, and he never forgets who he is. He grows kinder and more selfless over time, but he's still himself by the end of the series; narcissistic, witty, and sassy. He's definitely one of the more fleshed-out male leads I've seen Kyoani do, I just wish they went into his past a little more.\\n\r\nSento is another interesting female lead, since I wasn't expecting her to change as much as she did. You can see how much being around Kanie had affected her, and her development is pretty impressive. Despite this, she and Latifa, the other main female, still fit the harem MC stereotypes that I hate so much, which is why I gave this criteria a 7 instead of an 8.\\n\r\nSome of the side characters like the less relevant mascots and other performers at Amaburi were a whole lot of fun, and did get some pretty nice character development, but I'd have liked to see more from them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI really did love Amaburi, as it was so refreshing to see such an interesting mix of adult and child themes in a show. Just when I thought we'd seen enough mushy kid-show scenes, it slaps us in the face with one of the cutesy mascots smoking or getting drunk and cat-calling waitresses. I'd definitely recommend this to someone who wants a more original story while also maintaining a good plot and interesting characters.",

            "content": "If you ever wondered what would happen when you cross a theme park based tycoon game and Kyoani, well here you go. Amagi Brilliant Park is a refreshingly different entry that proves that Kyoani can still continue to distinguish itself. The show is about a ludicrously bad amusement park with comically bad attractions and likewise dull \"cast members.\" In order to prevent the park from closing, a former child star named Seiya is literally forced at gunpoint into attracting a few hundred thousand visitors in just a few months.\r\nThis series, for the most part, is a relatively light, comical watch with cute Kyoani antics anda (strangely) lecherous group of supporting cast members. It's an entertaining watch as you see the park slowly but steadily improve into something more befitting its name. As a unique entry with a likeable cast and surprise appearance from Bonta-kun's derivative, I'd definitely give this a try. Just don't expect Fumoffu-like comedy as Seiya is no Sousuke.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is crisp and modern with a bright and saturated color palette. Backgrounds are decently detailed though the sky in particular is nicely drawn, especially at sunset. The characters are well drawn and easily distinguishable. You get a lot of different creatures as cast members and the more human members all likewise get the Kyoani moe treatment; just try to watch the entire thing and not think \"that was cute.\" Facial expressions are very good, especially considering the supposedly fixed expressions of the mascots.\\n\\n\r\nThere is light action in the form of attractions (shooting stuff) and Isuzu shooting people into submission. Given the light nature, I wouldn't expect anything too serious about the action. There is occasional fan service, though mostly of a verbal, suggestive nature from the trio mascots and the weird dinosaur who has to \"hunch over\" all the time.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI think the OP is a bit over the top in terms of tonality but the melody is bright and fitting for the show. The ED is a slower but more traditional pop piece sung by the four elemental girl fairies. The show has an above average BGM suite with some particularly nice tunes; most of the tunes are nice and calming.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also has a great VA cast with strong performances all around. Kouki Uchiyama does a great job of giving Seiya a lot of confidence to match the narcissist personality and Ai Kakuma does a likewise great job voicing Isuzu, giving her an overall emotionless demeanor but with occasional outbursts of cuteness. The main mascots are also voiced by extremely experienced VAs to round out a pretty good team.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story of Amagi is pretty simple. Seiya is hired to try to reinvigorate the virtually lifeless park. As you can guess by each episode's title, there is a particular theme in each episode. However, at the end of each episode there is a summary of the number of visitors for that day as well as an overall summary of visitors so far in the year; just to make sure you recall how dire their situation is.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how bad things are, the show carries on with a hopeful and happy tone until two thirds through the show. Once you know the real reason why it is so important for the park to survive, things start getting serious. The show quickly becomes very engaging and the rising action builds quickly to a somewhat expected climax. Nonetheless, the show resolves in a nice but somewhat bittersweet end.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a good mix of a lot of elements (comedy, management, showbiz, occasional ero) but there are definitely still some residual open questions at the end of the show. There is a fair amount of emphasis on a childhood memory of Seiya though it is never fully explained, and the entire conclusion, though conclusive, arguably leaves room for further expansion (perhaps an OVA?). Regardless, the combination of the unique setting, premise, plot, and characters worked to make this a pretty enjoyable ride.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAmagi has a large but entertaining mix of characters. You'll be spending most of the time with the conceited yet able Seiya, often accompanied by the cutely muffled personality of Isuzu. You'll also often fall victim to the antics of the lecherous mascot trio and take a few detours with the four fairies. Though I always preach against having a large cast, it's somewhat unavoidable given the nature of the setting; and given that, I think they did a great job of differentiating all the characters and giving them a strong sense of presence. Personally, I found the ecchi-minded mascots hilarious considering their normally child-friendly appearance. Moffle is no Bonta-kun but still very fun nonetheless. Overall, expect lively personalities with good chemistry all around. Just don't expect too much relationship development, as it's only lightly played with.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis refreshingly unique watch definitely has the KyoAni touch. It can get a bit off track with random asides and the magical elements are a bit underdeveloped at times but overall it's a fun watch with a comical, yet occasionally tense plot and likeable characters. There probably won't be a need to rewatch the show but I wouldn't be surprised if there is an OVA or second season.",

I keep coming back to give each episode another chance, but I get more and more put off by the male MC, Kanie Seiya. He's just a straight up douche bag. At times, he shows glimmers of potential in his actions, but he seemingly partakes in such actions for the sake of his own interests and furthering as a narcissistic individual. \r\nI may be making a grave mistake in putting this show on hold.I see a fairly universal consensus of the gem that this show is within the genre of romantic comedy. Yet being a HUGE fan of romantic comedy, I've found this show to be a complete dirge thus far. It's been hard to watch, yet even so, I want to keep trying. I feel as if I'm missing something. I'm so detached from most of the characters and struggle with relating to them in their various facets that I'm tempted to drop it and probably will, at least for the time being. \\n\\n\r\nThis reaction is puzzling to me, as I'm usually not picky with anime. As a genre and means of story telling, I admire many of the ideas that are offered within the entire sphere of this art. Yet this series has been a real bore, a real pain and an immense chore to continually watch. I'll give it some more tries though, as I am hoping that the episodes to come will have more to offer. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as positives for this show, the originality of the story is a plus. Yet given different characters or different character qualities, I feel like so much more could be done with this series. While Kanie Seiya holds no interest to me whatsoever, his secretary Isuzu has been an interesting character who adds a level of humanity and intrigue to this plethora of otherwise mediocre to bad characters. Knowing just a bit of her backstory provides a great deal of understanding as to who she is, why she is the way she is and how she feels a great deal more than she ever lets on. Thus far, she seemingly takes an interest in Seiya, even as he addresses her tactlessly with little remorse. I hope in continuing with this anime, that their relational dichotomy can provide a grounds for Seiya to get off of his high horse. But hey, I didn't write this story. I can only hope though... \\n\\n\r\nAfter exhausting my personal feelings regarding the story and characters, I suppose I'll briefly sum up some of the other aspects of the show... \\n\\n\r\nArt- The artwork is gorgeous, vibrant and colorful. Definitely a perk to this series. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Music- Sound quality is great, music is meh. I still haven't taken a liking to the theme song at all. The vocalist sounds like a Japanese Katy Perry, and I can only handle so much American Katy Perry. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I really haven't enjoyed it all that much. That aside, I think the series is well made and probably holds a treasure trove of character development and interest that I have yet to behold. I really hope that I'm wrong about this series and that it turns out to be the rom/com gem that people have told me that it is. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 5.",

            "content": "Amagi Brilliant Park lives up to its name.\r\nThis show is a comedy that follows the exploits of the narcisstic Kanie. One can take a few logical steps to see who the studio was making fun of with that name.\r\nKanie is tasked with being the prophesied one that will save the theme park of Amagi Brilliant Park. Da fuq kind of prophecy is that? The theme park has hit a rough patch and hasn't been getting many visitors to show up to the park, so it's Kanie's job to fix that...and hijinks ensue.\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park has an ensemble cast of players, but by far my favoritewere the two supporting characters Macaron and Tirami. These two characters are so awful that they were upset at a certain point that there was a happy ending and nobody got killed. Other times they're up to no good doing less than benevolent things to other workers at the park.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great character is the lead mascot Moffle. He's the typical entertainer with a bad temper that often gets into fistfights with Kanie and visitors to the park. It is rather hilarious to see a midget bear animated going full jeet kune do and knocking someone out.\\n\\n\r\nIt's refreshing to see an anime where the lead male doesn't end up with a harem by the end. There are plenty of female supporting characters that he could have ended up with too. A romance subplot does exist, but it's hardly fleshed out and doesn't go anywhere. This is the most frustrating part with Amagi Brilliant Park because the male lead and female lead do like each other, but it's a total letdown in the end.\\n\\n\r\nStill, as far as comedy goes, this show is top notch.",

I feel on a whole this anime has several strong points for those who like very specific slice of life type shows, with a little fantasy thrown in, but there were a few concerning points.  \r\nMainly my issue with this anime is the pacing, for an anime that is only thirteen episodes some episodes felt so slow and long I almost began doing other things waiting for things to pick up.  It's a fairly standard plot, fairly normal anime guy getsput in with a bunch of weirdos and solves their problem, said normal guy also has some dark secret (aka his past), and finally fairly normal guy begrudgingly states that his life is more interesting and fulfilling with this crazy rag tag group.  \\n\r\nFor some reason however, some of the episodes felt so long and drawn out, and you never get a really good explanation as to why the main character was chosen for the job.  He also has a pretty complicated (for a A type main character) backstory that never gets delved into (---spoilers--- fear of heights, something with his mom?).  It feels as though the animators had a pretty funny concept, and instead of making every episode crazy and hilarious, there were these minor attempts to make it more 'deep' then it needed to be.  I thought on a whole it was funny, and the last episode was very suspenseful, but in the end I wish there would have been more filler episodes about the characters rather than non-plot episodes with just the main character.  I'm still on the fence about how it should be changed, but as it stands I don't see it getting a second season or drawing a huge range of fans.",

            "content": "Summary\r\nAmagi Brilliant Park is an enjoyable and well structured, but unusual, slice of life show. With a diverse set of characters and some humorous moments, it tells a story well without cliches but never really a mounts to anything special or memorable.\r\nOverview\r\nThe story kicks off at rapid pace and should have roped you in by the first episode. Seiya Kanie is an intelligent, but arrogant and narcissistic high achiever. Sento Izumi a somewhat cold and brash girl, who's interpersonal skills involve winning people over with violence. Izumu convinces Seiya to become the manager of the a failing amusement park - which is the home tomany magical beings that live off peoples happiness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the plot, just revolves around Seiya making decisions to get the park back on track. This more often than not involves unexpected issues and how the characters learn to deal with this. Unfortunately the journey to success isn't remarkable by itself - in fact more note worthy is just the interactions between the charterers and dealing with the mild drama between themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some brief moments where you think you will be given insight in to the backgrounds of the characters (aside from the two leads), but these are quickly glossed over in favour of melodrama - which is always conveniently wrapped in an episode meaning there is no time given to developing bigger story arcs or contributing depth to the story.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not necessarily a bad thing, and what you do get is still a well made and watchable show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show never really sets out to have a romantic element, however you are shown some moments shared by Seiya and Izumi, and it's a shame this never really amounts to anything more other than awkward glances or \"things left unsaid\", as both are genuinely interesting but under-developed characters. In fact, both are arguably great in what they do, but are flawed deeply on a personal level and this would've actually have a good premise to actually explore a relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of the show has a pleasant lead into a series 2, but that seems unlikely to occur. The show however does end in a satisfying way\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nThis is a straight forward, watchable slice of life anime about magical creatures trying to make a life for themselves in amusement park with the help of a self-centred, smart high school boy. It never really wows, or astounds, or leaves any memorable moments - but it doesn't falter either, and doesn't leave you feeling unfulfilled.\\n\\n\r\nNote: The characterisations vary differently from the Light Novels and Manga, and",
