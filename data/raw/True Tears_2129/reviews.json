            "content": "\u201cBecause I gave my tears away.\u201d\r\nThat was the line that first introduced me to True Tears. Now I would like to use this same line to introduce you all to this realistic romance series. The True Tears legacy began with very disappointing visual novel sales that ranked it as 41 among the 50 newly released visual novels at the time. Shortly after the visual novel came a live action film of True Tears that resembles closely to the game. So now you must thinking the anime is naturally just another adaptation to the visual novel as well right? Wrong!\r\nThe anime version of True Tears sharesnothing in common with the visual novel or the film (beside the name). It has its own independent plot, its own independent setting, and its own independent set of characters. Thus why use the name True Tears and give credit to the original visual novel creator when there is virtually nothing in common is beyond my understanding. However, what I do understand is that True Tears is an attempt by Lantis to produce a similar anime type to Air/Kanon/Clannad by Kyoto Animation. The purpose of this review is not to compare and criticize True Tears with the above anime, but I personally feel True Tears is worthy of such comparison if there is one.\\n\\n\r\nMany viewers may find the story of True Tears resembling Kanon or Clannad in lots of ways, such as the usual touching scenes that make us cry a river. However due to the nature of the story, instead of dealing with half a dozen heroines we only have three. Thus allowing more time to better develop their characters. One may be tempted to call True Tears a harem anime due to all the females \u201cganging\u201d up on our protagonist, but I see this as an essential part to developing a love-triangle (and NO, there\u2019s nothing ecchi in the anime). The anime takes a rather different approach to the regular love story and one can say it truly brings out the realism to this matter through the careful use of wordings. However it should be noted that, like most other story with a certain degree of depth, True Tears incorporates a great deal of metaphoric comparison. While it is not difficult to understand what those metaphors imply, some viewers may be discouraged by them.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationships between all the characters are expertly developed. In addition to the multi layer relations that are common in most romance genre, we also see a great deal of interactions between the younger and older generation of characters and how they affect one another. The protagonist\u2019s parents certainly played a more central role compare with most animation from this genre. However, what I like best is the perfect illustration of a young boy\u2019s heart when confronted with two (or three) possible lovers. I, for one, instantly saw a reflection of myself from Shinichirou (not that I am two-timing or anything, but I find his actions highly logical for a boy his age). I think I would most likely be as confused (if not more confused) than he is if I were in his situation especially after all those shocking events.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise it certainly lives up to fans expectations. This is especially true for the key scenes of the show. As evident from the title of the anime, tears do truly seem different in here. Tears in True Tears are very beautiful, the glittering salty water look exceptionally real when running down the cheeks of various characters. In addition to tears, the fluidity of the character movements, the detailed shadows on the face of the characters as they speak, the camera angles used to illustrate certain key aspects such as the 3D walking scene etc.; everything adds up little by little and before you know it you will find yourself having a hard time reverting back to watching lower quality animations. I still have a difficult time trying to find a show with superior animation quality compare to True Tears.\\n\\n\r\nLike the awesome animation production, True Tears\u2019 music is also not to belittled with. The music was effectively used both in terms of BGM and OP/ED as they all served their purposes well. BGM creates the mood just needed to make some scenes touching enough to make people go teary-eyed. The OP is by eufonius whom Clannad fans should be familiar with. I personally find True Tears\u2019 OP much better than Clannad\u2019s though. Unlike most anime, True Tears\u2019 seiyu did not interest me much (nor did they play any role in my decision to watching it). The biggest name out of the main casts is probably Kaori Nazuka (Nunnally in Code Geass, Eureka in Eureka Seven, Lynette in Strike Witches). With that note, I would like to truly thank the Lantis production crew for bringing us (the anime fans) a wonderful romance series that will forever have a place in my anime romance list.",

            "content": "True tears is a story that focuses on the life of a high school student and his interactions with the three heroines of the story. The story focuses on the romance and drama in the lives of the characters.\r\nI think that the storyline was one of the best i have seen for a 13 episode anime. It was just the right length for such a story. The anime incorporates a lot of realism and really brings out the drama of a love triangle. The story looks at love from a path less ventured on and is different from your typical love story. Some may callthis a harem because all the main girls fall in love with the main character but it is very different from your usual harem because it looks at it from a more realistic and serious angle. Expect a lot of drama and meaning in this show. Though a word of caution that this show is a bit enigmatic due to its metaphorical usage of &quot;chickens flying&quot; and a strange and unique theme of tears. But you'll catch on eventually so do not fret even if you do not understand at first.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was simply amazing. The backgrounds and sceneries were drawn with such vibrance and the colours were vivid and easy on the eyes. The use of watercolour in the show by the main character also brings out a very nice animation feel to the show. One of the best artworks in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was so-so. What really stood out were the voice actors. Especially the four main characters. They played the characters so well and i think it really contributed to the feel of the anime. Inserts were made towards the end which helped to create the atmosphere and i think the OP song was very suited for this anime. It's good but not the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were also very well done. Each having a good deal of depth for such a short anime series. Espcially since there were quite a few main characters, to cover such a wide range of characters in such a short span is quite good. Perhaps a bit more focus on the side characters like the two best friends of the lead girl and guy would have been good, but considering the time span i guess it's still ok. The characters were also not your usual cliche characters in a romance anime, especially Noe, to have such a character in the show makes it more unique and unpredictable.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime for its romance and drama. But it was lacking in the comedy area. But i guess it's ok since the drama was brought out pretty well as a result. Thus the story may appear a bit gloomy. It was also a bit slow at the start but the pace picks up as the story goes, so for those who are impatient you might have trouble with this anime at the start. However, i think the anime was very meaningful because you can sympathize with the characters and is thus very attention grabbing at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, This anime is not to be missed. Especially if you are a romance-drama fan. The anime managed to portray many key elements in the show within the short time span and i think that the anime will leave a lasting impression on all who watch it. However, patience may be needed in the course of undertsanding the story and the characters. If you are looking for something more light-hearted then perhaps you may not find this to you liking.\\n\\n",

            "content": "True Tears is a fairly typical Slice of Life, Romance, Comedy, Drama based on an unusual theme of tears (amongst other things). From the beginning the story is pretty ordinary, for this type of anime, as it has a male protagonist (Shinichirou) and it introduces him, his surroundings and the heroines involved in the story (Noe, Hiromi & Aiko). However it is really difficult to tell what the story is entirely about or where it is headed, until things reach a certain point. That is when some major developments arise but it\u2019s a shame that the series is almost half over by that point.\r\nHere wehave the usual stock of high school boys and girls for characters and there\u2019s nothing really particularly special about them. However a few of them have something unique about them that allows them stand out (Noe). But the character relations are what make the characters interesting because other than the simple-minded guys; the girls add a bit of perplexity to the mix as you cannot be entirely sure of what their true and honest feelings are.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the series I can definitely say that the animation is the most outstanding aspect of this anime series, as it utilizes superb environments, well-drawn characters and well placed but somewhat overused CG effects/models. The most noticeable feature is the backgrounds, which looks like it was painted using soft water colours and it seamlessly blends well with the fluid foreground animations.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is composed of a variety of piano and violin symphonies that works well with the laid-back nature of the show. It also does a good job in setting the mood for some drama but the weak dialogue doesn\u2019t help whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nOverall True Tears proved to be a great romance anime, for all the romance anime lovers who need their seasonal fix. There are some surprisingly good aspects to the show, which allow it to easily overshadow the major downfalls like the male cast. The humour in the beginning does help set this up to be an enjoyable series but like always expect to see some major drama. So if you\u2019re into this type of romance anime then make sure you check it out.",

            "content": "True Tears was an anime adaptation of visual novel of the same name.  Although, I&rsquo;m hesitant in calling it an adaptation as True Tears the anime has nothing in common with the game.  The story, characters, setting, and even the themes employed are different from the game version, with the exception of the name.  I was initially excited a few years ago when I heard about it, but when I heard how poorly the game was received I had extremely low expectations.  Thankfully, the anime was also extremely different in terms of quality.    \r\nThe story itself is extremelytypical of the romance genre.  However, it is told in an extremely realistic and down-to-earth manner.  Just reading the summary of True Tears gives one this impression.  In addition, so are the characters, you won&rsquo;t find any goddess, aliens, espers, or time travelers (and no, I&rsquo;m not making a Haruhi reference) here, instead our cast is filled with normal people.  I sometimes forget that I&rsquo;m watching an anime as they rarely use animation conventions, such as speed lines, exaggerated expressions, etc.  So one may wonder, &ldquo;why should I watch this, the summary and even you are saying that it isn&rsquo;t a very unique story?&rdquo;  Well, it is true, I won&rsquo;t deny that, but what makes True Tears are the incredibly deep and complex character as well as the extremely subtlety in which the story is told.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, True Tears is told in an extremely consistent manner with near perfect pacing.  After a few episodes, once the introductions are done, the story builds upon itself and has a satisfying conclusion.  However, True Tears has an interesting story structure.  For True Tears the climax and the falling action, or the ride down, didn&rsquo;t happen all in the last 2 episodes.  Instead the climax of the various story threads happened around episodes 6-8 thus, giving them plenty of time to resolve everything.  However, not all of the story threads exhibited a very smooth falling action in particular, the main one and thus True Tears suffered a bit near the end.  Nevertheless during episodes 9-13, all of those threads were resolved, with the major ones being resolved during the last episode.  Although this can be seen as a negative as it doesn&rsquo;t keep the excitement up till the end.  For many single kour anime series the climax happens in the 2nd to last episode (2-3 before the end for 2 kour series).  Once again this makes thing exciting up to the end but it puts too much stress on the last episode to resolve everything.  Because of the way the story was told, True Tears didn&rsquo;t end with a bang, instead it ends with on a whimper.  It is possible for True Tears to end on an extremely dramatic note, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be true to itself.  That is a very down to earth, subtle anime.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, True Tears is more of an ensemble than a harem, as there are 6 major characters (3 male, 3 female) with a focus on Shinichiro, Hiromi, and Noe.  Also, despite there being 6 major character and 13 episodes they all had sufficient character development and depth.  In addition, all the characters are flawed and very much human.  These are characters I can identify with and understand.  However, because of this it makes some characters not as likeable.  In a way, the characters are painfully too human.  In addition, the character that really surprised me was Miyokichi, the seemingly token male friend.  Characters like this are primarily used as comedic side characters, for example Sunohara in Clannad.  Miyokichi is nothing like this, he received quite a bit of depth and complexity reserved only for main characters in most other series. \\n\\n\r\nAnother big surprise was the quality of the animation.  PA works was a completely unknown studio and produced something on the level of KyoAni.  In some ways surpass them on certain aspects.  For example, in the basketball scene in Clannad (by KyoAni) uses many speed lines, a perfectly normal anime convention to convey high speed/movement, not just KyoAni, most studios do this.  In True Tears the players actually move and the use of the camera is something akin to what I like to call, Itano circus for basketball.  Not only that the world in True tears is very much alive, as there are people, animals, etc that are constantly moving in the background.  Sure they use CG for the people walking in the background but it is done in a way where its hardly noticeable.  Also, the attention to detail that PA works put into True Tears is beyond ridiculous.  For example, the snow, the way it is spread is extremely realistic as well as being realistically dirty.  However, the most definitive scene for me was the dance near the end of the series.  Not only are all the dancers different they are just slightly and realistic out of sync.  As for the art, it was actually pretty unique, most of the time there is a slight softness in the backgrounds.  Not on the same level as Honey and Clover but enough to give it a slight picture book feel.  Another distinct point in the art was the use of dramatized shots that look exactly like Shinichiro&rsquo;s art book.    This is something that kind of bothers me, as it stood out too much.  It is possible that it is relates to the picture book Shinichiro is writing, either way I wasn&rsquo;t too fond of it.  Is PA Works another KyoAni?  Maybe, we&rsquo;ll have to see if they can keep up the quality.          \\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice work was quite exceptional and kept with the overall subtlety of the series.  Music is held back and is rarely in-your-face.  The OP Reflictia by Eufonius has officially made me a fan of her work.  As for the ending, nothing special, the chibi characters walking across the screen was&hellip;interesting.  It feels a bit out of place considering the overall tone of the series.  The voice actors did an amazing job and in particular I was quite impressed with Hiromi&rsquo;s VA.  Her VA did an amazing job conveying the sadness and restrain of Hiromi.\\n\\n\r\nI only have one real complaint for True Tears.  As I mentioned above the falling action for the main story thread wasn&rsquo;t very smooth.  This is because I believe the writers got trapped into a classic romance convention.  That is holding off who the main character picks until the very end and this is perfectly understandable as they want to keep the viewer excited till the end.  This is not necessary be a bad thing but it damages Shinichiro&rsquo;s character by making him indecisive and thus hurting the ones around him.    That&rsquo;s why I wasn&rsquo;t as happy with the one or two episodes before the final episode.  However, its not like we didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking and there were clues point in one direction, its just that they kept it a bit too ambiguous.  This resulted in mixed interpretation and frustration when one&rsquo;s predictions failed.  \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe True Tears, I would say &ldquo;subtle.&rdquo;  Just about everything about this anime is subtle, from the way the characters talk to their actions.  This anime will have you constantly thinking between the lines to really understand what is going on.  Once again this is both a strength and weakness as some viewers may simply miss important clues.  In addition, they employ several interesting themes and metaphors, for example, Shinichiro&rsquo;s picture book, flying, and &lsquo;true tears.&rsquo;  I could easily write pages analyzing these themes but, since this is a review on the anime I won&rsquo;t.  So if you are the type to watch anime for relaxation purposes or with your brain turned off, then cross True Tears off your &ldquo;to watch or interested list&rdquo;, this anime is not for you.  Ok, let me rephrase that, the beauty of True Tears comes from it&rsquo;s subtly and depth, something that cannot be appreciated by watching on a superficial level.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, let me say that this review is at least twice as long as I planned.  I guess it only shows how much I enjoyed this series as I couldn&rsquo;t stop typing.",

            "content": "The first line of the show is your very typical drama-like statement, \"The you inside me is always crying\". Little did you know is that the Shinichiro was talking about the viewer and how much you wanted to cry after watching this show. You're not crying because your sad, and definitely not because you're happy, but because your body is so full with rage that tears have to be removed to make room for more rage.\r\nSpoilers galore in here.\r\nLet's go over the plot, oh goody, I wonder what kind of plot they have in store. Nakagami Shinichiro lives with his mother, his father, and hisadopted sister. Of course, Shinichiro and his adopted sister, Yuasa Hiromi, are very distant under the same roof. Then he meets another girl, Isurugi Noe, and then you meet his childhood friend, Ai-chan which are thrown in for an unnecessary love-triangle.\\n\\n\r\nBy the first two episodes, it's very obvious that Shinichiro and Hiromi like each other, but of course, they're forbidden to love each other due to complications in their family situation. Shinichiro doesn't want to admit it. Hiromi thinks that Shinichiro is her brother. Don't worry, I'll get to that in a moment. Just let me take my time. So, Shin-dope meets newcomer Noe-chan who thinks that male lead is the one that can get her tears back. The first broken plot device. Then Hiromi likes to complicate things even farther by saying to Shin-dope that she doesn't like him, it's conveniently Noe's brother.\\n\\n\r\nShin-dope and Noe become such good friends that Noe's brother somehow tracks Shin-man down to his address and asks him to go out with Noe. Shin-man, being the brilliant idealist that he is, thinks it would be best to make a contract with her shady brother. \"You go out with Hiromi, I'll go out with Noe!\". Second broken plot device. I mean, what was the purpose of this deal? What would this deal accomplish? Noe's brother gets what he wanted for a price. Hiromi gets burdened for making things complicated and conveniently made room for broken plot devices. So then Nii-chan and Hiromi go out. Then it takes Shin-man forever to make his move on his side of the contract. A contract that was never written and never specified. So Hiromi and other guy awkwardly make fake romance so Shin-man will make his move. For some reason, the awkward-fake couple can't break up because that'll break the contract. Supposedly. The viewer is somehow supposed to know that.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of the contract is somewhat baffling to  me as I cannot figure out the terms of the contract or why the contract was made in the first place. These two guys go out of their way to make a contract on other's personal lives and then make it so that they're connected like a mirror. \"If I do this, you do it too!\". This doesn't work in anyway and only further prevents Shin-man and Hiromi to be more awkward with each other. Great, I missed the best part of this anime... because the first four episodes with them two had so much magic that I just couldn't handle it.\\n\\n\r\nBecause Hiromi has no depth as a character, the writers thought that the only way people would like Hiromi would be to create sympathy from the viewer. Which is the third broken plot device. Shinichiro's mother hates Hiromi because she's not her daughter. When she first moves in, years before the show starts, she claims that [Hiromi's mother] cheated on [Hiromi's father] with [Shinichiro's father] to create her. That would make Shinichiro and Hiromi siblings. The fourth broken plot device. Now they feel even more awkward around each other. There is so much magic between the two, I feel like this is a Disney movie!\\n\\n\r\nThe role of Shinichiro's mother is baffling too. She goes so much out her way to make Hiromi feel unwanted. By episode-whatever,  we learn that the might be sibling's thing is a lie. The mother even went so out of her way to back-up that lie that she cut out [Hiromi's mother's] face out of pictures. But then she turns around and begins to treat Hiromi like one of her own after she gets into a bike accident and tarnishes her new family's name. So when Hiromi didn't do anything wrong, she was hated, but when she runs away and gets into an accident and suspended from school she's then rewarded with love. Huh? I mean, what was the mother's motive in the first place? What did Hiromi's mother do to her that she had to make up such an absurd story? This is when the show becomes damaged beyond repair. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character that baffles me is Ai-chan, the childhood friend that is dating Shin-dope's best friend. Her character doesn't baffle me, it's the reason why she's in this show that baffles me. She's basically there to add extra drama to the fake drama. She likes Shin-dope (and who doesn't at this point?) and kisses him while she's dating his best friend, who is a much better guy than Shin-guy.  But thankfully she dumps the other guy and decides to move on from Shin-dude anyway. Crisis averted.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we know that Shin-dude and Hiromi aren't siblings. You can finally sleep at night and call the right name of the girl you're sleeping with. Oh. Wait. There's two broken plot devices in the way. The contract and a sweet girl named Noe. Noe and Shin-moron are now going out and Shin-idiot actually draws a picture book about it. A picture book about the chicken that could fly. But then the chicken couldn't fly because his adopted sister is now just his adopted sister. So now he thinks he has a shot with Hiromi. Which now Shin-shin and Hiromi are never awkward because of this. In fact, I was never sure why these two liked each other anyway besides the fact that they're both attractive. They never talked under the same roof, and they don't even know each other. Hell, Hiromi even says it in some episode, \"I never got to know you after all this time\". So that implies they never got to know each other. Meanwhile, Shinichiro and Noe have a pretty good thing going. But Shinichiro now thinks that \"Now is the time to take flight\" and let's his hormones run wild and chases after Hiromi as she is moving away to an apartment to live on her own.  When they meet up, the dumbest line in the show is said. \"I'll do everything proper from now on\". As if anything Shin-moron had done before was proper (if you need a hint, nothing so far has been proper and will continue not to be proper). What Shin-chan means by that, I don't even know. And while these two are hugging in the middle of the street. That contract is still in effect because neither of them have broken-up with Noe's brother or Noe. \\n\\n\r\nHell, Noe and her brother seem more in love with each other than any other relationship in the series. Maybe that should be the plot. The forbidden love between those two. Then the less interesting Hiromi and Shin-idiot could get in the way. It could be called \"True Incest\". Instead of this fast one they pulled on me.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Hiromi now lives alone and we get to see her do splits. The most enticing part of the show. Now that the two lovebirds are separated, their love becomes deeper and more intense. Even though their in the same class and they don't know each other.\\n\\n\r\nSo now it's time for the festival dance and time to tell Noe that he and Hiromi are now in love. Oh goody, let's see how our brilliant idealist goes about doing this. He dances and then Hiromi tells Noe, and I quote, to \"leave them alone\". As far as I'm concerned, Noe was placed into the situation because of Hiromi being a bitch all the time. She never liked Noe in the first place because she was friends with Shin-moron. Then she's the cause of Shin-moron making the contract that automatically pulls her into the situation. So now, Noe is intentionally placed in the middle of these two idiots, and their insecurities, as an obstacle and they treat her like she's done something wrong. This causes her to test flying, in result, breaking her leg from jumping off a tree. Shin-moron then gets angry at Noe and tosses the picture book in the ocean, a page at a time to make it look artsy. I skipped over the last episodes, so I don't even know if Noe got her tears back. Probably not. Why did Hiromi think it was okay to just take Shin-moron's responsibility and just do it all herself? Who wrote this ****?\\n\\n\r\nThe art was okay. The 3D was clunky looking while students were walking out. The 3D Shinichiro didn't even look like the animated one. Animation was okay. I don't remember listening to any music, because the voices in my head were fighting due to this show. The ED and OP were okay though.\\n\\n\r\nTo add, the most interesting characters we ain't seen enough of. Miyokichi, Shin-moron's best friend, and Noe. This show goes downhill fast after episode seven, and I would never recommend this trash to anyone. This show lied to me like my ex-girlfriends did. Leaving me doubtful and upset. At the end, I found myself lost and confused and I lost faith in love, friendship, everything. I had to make sure I didn't lose my soul due to this show. Then I looked at the reviews of this show and I also found myself baffled about how people give this show anything more than a five. \\n\\n\r\nThings just don't add up. This show has a plot that is more convenient then the laptop in my bathroom.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"-What are tears?\r\n-Let's see, when you're sad...\r\n-Not when... what are tears?\r\n-Well, to keep your eyeballs clean and moist the tear glands secrete...\"\r\nTrue Tears was P.A. Works' debut anime as a solo independent company. It wasn't based on a manga, light novel, visual novel, anything, it was a original production. Because of this, the studio was considered careless by a considerate percentage of the critics, however, this helped increasing the series' audience at its premier, it was an audacious move after all. With the show progressing and popularity constantly increasing, it prof itself a well played market strategy. \r\nThen, someone might say \"What is it worthbeing a original production if it's crap?\" \\n\r\nInteresting point. There's no merit at all in creating a story that won't live up to viewers expectations. \\n\r\nLuckily, True Tears doesn't fall into that trap. It might not work for everyone but it is, undeniably, a well elaborated and carefully conducted story.\\n\r\nYes. I'm well aware I just poked a sore spot. Unlike what the previously lines stated, lots of people consider its story to be a huge failure, blaming character development to be the villain of it. Unrealistic characters, patterned story, flat personalities, are just some of the major criticisms this anime receives. They aren't completely wrong, and of course, each of us has our own opinion, however these statements are focusing into small flaws and turning them into huge plot holes without taking in consideration the environment surround it. Meaning: Other elements of the storyline and small pieces of character dialogues which explains and corrects those \"mistakes\" so that when you see the final product, all the pieces must be visualized together and these flaws becomes invisible. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a misunderstanding to label True Tears as a Harem to start of. Harem series, for the ones who aren't familiar with it, are those stories where the main male lead is surrounded by girls -all in love with him- and the protagonist can't make up his mind, because he enjoys his situation or for pure hesitation. Somebody who watches the first 2 episodes of True Tears will notice that this anime isn't about it. \\n\r\nJust like that, I would humbly ask you to NOT take in consideration the series summary here in MAL. Clearly who wrote it didn't watch the complete series (besides from spoiling the entire first episode).\\n\\n\r\nTrue Tears strong attribute is the Drama, with Romance as a important side-kick of it. After all, a emotional loaded series without heartwarming moments would be just too painful to watch.\\n\r\nThe story progresses exploring inner conflicts of the characters, set with situations from their past strongly represented through metaphors and subtext that will require some Pause-Play action in order to fully understand it. \"The Tale of Raigomaru and Jibeta\" was sure the ace in the pocket of producers. \\n\r\nIt's nice to emphasize the symbolism of it. The anime was structure in a way both stories (The actual main one and the fictional Raigomaru's) are developed independently. However, they are joint in the meaning, and Raigomaru's is constantly influenced by the outcome of events on characters life's. \\n\r\nJust like that, I was impressed how this show managed to represent characters reactions to events on the story in a perfect \"human\" way. It's well known, that drama series are often criticized because of strong emotionally packet scenes suddenly followed by easygoing everyday events as if nothing happened, leaving that sour taste on the mouth. True Tears escape from this pattern, as Raigomaru's Tale shows and the same applies for other characters as well. Hiromi performance on her basketball practices, Noe's berries, etc...\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to misunderstand True Tears characters. Specially if one listen to a friend who watched it or reads about it somewhere. Even reading these reviews might change the way someone interprets them. Hopefully to a better one.\\n\r\nThese characters personalities are way more complex than what we're used to, and the reason why they can't be simply explained is because production succeeded at making some really realistic characters. However, the challenge of an advance like this is too keep every character on the same level of complexity, otherwise, some would become flat and others way too dense. And... this is what happened. Not to mention supportive characters were completely neglected, although this is still acceptable due to the focus of the anime.\\n\r\nUsing the three main characters as an example, Hiromi and Shinichiro background story was well structured and understanding the reason of some of their actions would require a deeper commitment from the side of the viewers. On the other hand, Noe's character, besides of her background story, was way too simplistic when compared to others, without a further development, only receiving producers \"attention\" at the end of the series. This creates a contrast that completely ruined the enjoyment for some people, turning what would be a great drama/romance into a hateful/psychological (Huh, dejav\u00fa Makoto-san).\\n\r\nStill, on the overall, the job done specially with Hiromi character was marvelous. That said, in my personal opinion, character is worth a 9 out of 10 since, like said previously, the final piece hides these mistakes. You know they're there, but they don't affect the enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Artwork were really smoothy. Being it a drama it was expected that characters expressions would be carefully animated and so it happened. Also worth mention the quality of small details like snow flakes, leaves and sea water sparks but above all, this anime really represented its name. True Tears had one of the best Tears animation I've ever seen. It is not rare to find series with horrible \"eye sweat\" animations. It was a surprise to see how well drawn they were.\\n\\n\r\nSound, music, OST, openings, casting... deserves nothing but praise. The seyuus chosen for this series fit perfectly to their characters. The OST written for it was also outstanding. Emotional packed violins and pianos but also acoustic guitars for happy funky scenes. Reflectia (the opening theme) even did recently a cameo appearance on P.A. Works most recent anime TariTari. Only thing I missed tough was the small number of insert songs. Just a couple of them.\\n\r\nHowever, analyzing the songs shouldn't be limited to just saying if they are good or bad, one important aspect of it is timing and placement. A insert song placed at an awkward moment can easily ruins the entire mood of a scene. True Tears didn't have problems with it. OST was perfect placed, something that greatly increases the emotional value of certain scenes.\\n\r\n-A notorious example of it would be the last scenes of episode 6.-\\n\\n\r\nStill, the most impressive about this anime is related to its story. \\n\r\nIts plot and script is way stronger and denser than lots of drama/romance series similar to it, however, it doesn't tries to impose feelings on you. It might make you shed some tears but it isn't a constant machine gun of feelings. You may end up thinking \"Oh man, this is sad\" but it stops at it, through the entire series there isn't a scene that you can notice it was prolonged to induce the viewers to cry or something similar.\\n\r\nIn the place of it, P.A Works built a compelling storyline, that keeps you entertained and curious to known what will happen next, what will a certain character do and how it gonna end. Specially how it gonna end, since the final conclusion was marvelous hidden till the very end.  \\n\r\nThis is a series I'd strongly recommend watching for a second time in order to fully understand it.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that is lovely about these romance anime it that you always get attached to the story and in most of the times, when there's a love polygon, you start cheering for a character/couple. The satisfaction of seeing your favorite character achieving his/her goal or the sadness of a misfortune is part of it. \\n\r\nIt's silly to bias the final enjoyment rating on this character success/failure, what matters is that the series managed to keep you entertained the whole time!\\n\r\nStory 9 / Character 9 / Art 8 / Sound 9 / Enjoyment 10 = Arithmetic Overall: 9\\n\\n\r\nTrue Tears, for me, was a masterpiece.\\n\r\nBut, c'mon. They could've picked a better name.",

            "content": "Complete and utter disappointment is what made me write this review, therefore making the show probably sound worse than it actually is, or is it?\r\nIf you're thinking about watching True Tears, then let me give you a warning not to expect too much of it, for that was my mistake right from the start. \r\nThe series began, for my taste, extremely promising and I couldn't wait for the second episode, but alas it was late and myself tired, so the only way to proceed was to sleep and watch the rest of the show the next day in one go. Little I new in myenthusiasm that I'd have to force myself to sit through the rest of the 12 episodes by drinking till I almost passed out. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I remember clearly about the first episode was the \u201eKyaa! Ecchi!\u201c-thing. I thought \u201ewow, using a clich\u00e9 from the harem-genre and putting it in a more realistic scenario, that's nice!\u201c. I expected then an intelligent change from your everyday harem-anime looked at by a more realistic angle...and somehow I got it, but with a cast where I don't even know which character I hated the most. \\n\\n\r\nThe creators of True Tears should have been so honest to tell me poor soul that this show takes place on planet \u201eSadist IV\u201c where everyone, first and foremost the females, are committed to lie and hurt others whenever possible. If that would have been made clear I could understand why nobody seems to care about being treated this way. But for me, accustomed to modern earthly standards of not being an asshole, I just don't get it. \\n\\n\r\nOne character especially deserving of my hatred is Shinichiro's mother. Why no one really deals with this vile-spitting harpy is beyond my understanding. When you have watched the series, just ask yourself, what would have happened if she wasn't such a complete and utter bitch or had died years ago in a preferably painful fashion. \\n\\n\r\nNoe seems to be somewhat of an exception in this line but irritated me in her own unique ways. Though I give her credit for trying to help others instead of thinking of ways to hurt them, as everyone else seems to do. \\n\\n\r\nAnother major flaw of the show is the plot consisting mostly of soap-like twists. While other shows might sometimes need or even profit from scriptwriting like that, True Tears would have done much better with concentrating on character development I think. Shinichiro doesn't really get to know any of the girls better, as there always seems to be a farfetched plot device lurking in the shadows, waiting to distract...most of all the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nWell, all that being said, I actually rewatched the series, this time being prepared for what was to come and therefore without the need to drink myself senseless. Knowing the end and all I actually understood most of the reasoning behind the things the characters did and said, but I still wondered why they had to do it in such a cruel and self-serving manner and if such people really could harbor deeply romantic feelings in such a way. But I see at least a ray of hope for all people liking this show, generous as I am. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation and sound I almost resented them for being too good, because I got the feeling the story itself didn't deserve such embellishment, but it's certainly one reason I couldn't give up on True Tears and simply hate it without wanting to know why. \\n\\n\r\nWhy it was this series which attracted that much hatred from me, I'm unsure. It seems to be the above mentioned disappointment. At the end of the first episode I was ready to believe this was going in my top 10-list. While other series in the past turned out to surprise one way or the other, too,  True Tears was a major letdown for me. So I really can't advice to stay clear of this one, just not to expect too much. \\n\\n\r\nThis review was my first one and I'm quite refreshed after writing my grudge away. If you facepalmed yourself several times while reading please consider my native language not being English as well as my perspective being shrouded in hatred and cynicism, thank you.",

            "content": "There goes another short but awesome romance anime. True Tears.  It's a simple, yet outstanding combination of romance, drama, comedy and slice of life.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is simple at first. One guy, three girls, seems like your average gotta-catch-'em-all harem, but this one is different from the majority. It starts lighthearted, explaining the relationship between our male lead, Shin, and the three girls in his life, Hiromi, Noe and Ai. What starts as a random encounter turns to be the ignition key for a beautiful story. No Deus-Ex-Machina, no things that seem out of this world, just a simple story about love, sadness and thetears that one sheds, the true tears that one cries only when the heart is wavering. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe animation is very good. As series pass by, it seems like the animation process becomes greater and greater, resulting awesome artwork like in True Tears. The characters are very well drawn, eye-candy almost everywhere, the background scenery is awesome and the scenes that matter most are those that are drawn the best. One thing that attracted my attention was the activity of the show. The backgrounds are filled with life: students passing by and discussing, birds flying around, the waves of the sea, it all seems so real. Hats-off to the True Tears artists that worked on the project, it's really something.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening song is one of the best songs I've ever heard, in my opinion. Eufonius is a great band and the song's rhythm and lyrics can make me speed up my pace and even sing along. \\n\r\nThe background music is very good, as with all the recent anime. I love the piano and violin music they use most of the time as it fits the mood perfectly. It's without flaws yet it can always be better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the strong points of this anime. They're human. Their emotions really get to you because they're human. The girls really stand out for a harem show, especially Noe, who's like a torch in the middle of the cave, you'll forever recognize her unique character after watching it. Then there's Hiromi, the sweet and kind girl with a bit of a troubled past, nothing our male leader can't handle, and Ai, the onee-san type that's fun and out-going. \\n\r\nShin, our male leader, is quite normal. Seems cool male leaders are popular these days. Well, he's anything but cool until the moment he finally decides to set things right. He might not be the smartest bean in the jar but he's a good guy. The one small thing that I didn't like was the lack of background story for the secondary characters (like Miyokichi or Tomoyo), the rest is awesome. I really loved the characters overall. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI usually don't write a review if I don't enjoy it and this my proof. I liked this anime from the first episode and it really moved me towards the end, it was an awesome series and it was worth every minute. I'm sad it ended, since I wanted to see more but you can't help it, all good things come to an end. \\n\r\nBottom of the line is that if you're into romance shows (like I am), you'll love this one. It has it all and much more and 13 episodes was too short to satisfy my hunger. Nevertheless, I'll keep this series in my &quot;top romance anime&quot; list.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Overall Grade: 8.6, rounded up to 9",

            "content": "Written with 6 episodes watched.\r\nStory: At first, True Tears appears to be your typical guy meets girl(s), guy must pick a girl storyline, but as you continue to watch the series, several apparent underlying themes reveal themselves. Although it is somewhat similar to most romance animes, I particularly like how True Tears has all \"contenders\", if you will, continuously active through the series; instead of concentrating on 1 girl then moving on to the next through a series of different story arcs. \r\nArt: The artwork presented in True Tears is simply breathtaking. Each scene is drawn with great detail, while the characters themselves are quitesimply, a work of art. Not only are the female characters a pleasure to look at (wink), the male characters are, too, well drawn. Generally most scenes are bright and very easy on the eyes and if you have the opportunity  of watching it in hi-res format, take it! Your eyes will thank you, and you'll enjoy the experience that much more. The animation of the characters is very realistic, and thus far in the all character movements have been within human boundaries (no 10 meter high fly kicks :P). With that said, the anime is no KyoAni, but I'd personally rate it pretty close.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening theme, as with most of Eufonius' tracks, is pleasing to listen to. The music throughout the series doesn't impact on the experience much, although there are some extremely well timed moments and perfectly suited songs that make the screne *that* much more deep and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The 4 main characters in the series are all likable, even though 3 of them lack confidence in directly approaching an issue, although that's common with most romance animes. The character development is steady through the first few episodes, you get to know who they are and what they're like quite quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime, thus far, has been enjoyable. There are various humorous parts that I thoroughly enjoyed and a fair amount of moving moments which I also enjoyed. A good watch for people who are KyoAni fans, or are just generally into Romance/Drama animes.",

The characters were great, especially Noe and Miyokichi, and with Shinichirou being pretty solid for a harem lead with Hiromi not being too bad of a lead chick with terminal Yamato Nadesico syndrome, everything seemed to be set for an enjoyable ride.\r\nAnd then episode nine hit.  Neither episode nine nor episode ten were bad, per se, but they were extremely bland.  Episode nine concluded all conflict in the show up till that point.  Suddenlyand without any passion.  It was all over.  This was an incredibly bad sign.  Episode ten was just nothing.  Here, it seemed, was a great show that was going to be ended prematurely and then dragged on pointlessly until the required thirteen episodes were met.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode eleven changed all that.  It was the beginning of a quick, brutal slide into pure suckation.  The story in those last few episodes was nonsense.  The characters dropped all semblance of character and became animatrons fulfilling their plot duties.

            "content": "Well wasn't this a doozy!\r\nTrue Tears is the story of a young man with a talent for drawing who wants to publish a book, but the main plotline is his burning desire for his de facto \"sister,\" Yuasa Hiromi. I'm exhausted and disappointed so this won't be much more than a brief overview.\r\nI came to this from Whisper of the Heart, as I'd heard this series also involved an artistically-inclined character who's inspired to create something that truly comes from the heart. And yes, I can say Shinichiro does exactly that, but it didn't quite strike a chord with me as WotH did. Anyway, TrueTears had a really promising start, with what appeared to be a rather clich\u00e9d slice-of-life school romance story a la Toradora! or Clannad, but it seemed subversive in a way (at first). That is, the series seemed to be aware of this stereotypical treatment and took occasional jabs at itself, sort of a way to turn the clich\u00e9s on their head.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there (I would say from the second half of the eighth episode), it devolved into an ACTUALLY clich\u00e9d and heavy-handed school life story. Drama isn't a bad thing, but damn if it didn't drag the entire series down with it.\\n\\n\r\nI think there are a few principle factors that led to this sharp decline: first was that the female lead/romantic interest was completely uninteresting. I can debate the personal qualities of Yuasa Hiromi's character from sundown to sunset, and it may in the end just be a matter of opinion anyway, but ultimately I never felt like I was \"with\" her, I never felt like I could realistically root for Shinichiro to win her over. I just didn't care.\\n\\n\r\nShin himself did quite a heel face turn as well. At least in that first half, although he was oddly fixated on Hiromi, he did seem to have some sense of self-awareness and conscience. Deep down, he seemed to at least mean well to his friends and acquaintances, even the more unusual among them. Over the second half of the series, he devolves into a generic school life jerk - that is, the one all the girls want, and God knows why.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think True Tears is really a terrible series overall, and the last half may not even actually be bad. It just seems like episodes eight through thirteen could have been so much more than they were, and they ended up being a spectacular letdown. It had such a strong start and what makes it so disappointing as a series is how quickly it appeared to lose steam.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know; maybe True Tears really is a completely subversive game-changer, toying with our automatic assumption that the main character of a slice-of-life romance may make mistakes and do stupid things but at least means well. Perhaps most of the cast save two was made deliberately unlikeable for that very reason. The weird thing is that looking back, I almost feel like after around episode eight or nine, the characters are turned into people they don't seem to have been just a couple episodes prior. It's like they're jostled permanently out of their own character. Maybe I'm the only one who felt that, but feel free to come to your own conclusions. And it's a shame too, because the OP is wonderful and the art at time is breathtaking.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I think that's enough non-sequitur and passionate nonsense for one review. In a nutshell, my take on True Tears is as follows: watch it if you want, but it's neither must-see nor must-avoid. If you do decide to watch it, perhaps you'll come to a different conclusion than I did, but I frankly would've been much happier (and may even have rated the series a lot higher) if it had ended a few episodes earlier.",

            "content": "True Tears is an anime that centers on Shin\u2019ichiro Nakagami, the male lead of the story. He is friends with Hiromi Yuasa since they were children. When Hiromi\u2019s parents died, she was taken in by the Nakagami Family. With that, Shin-chan (what Shin\u2019ichiro\u2019s mother call him) struggles and at the same time develops even stronger feelings for Hiromi.\r\nHe meets Isurugi Noe in an unfateful encounter. Shin\u2019ichiro begins to get closer to Noe, and develops affection for her.\r\nStory: (6/10)\r\n\u201cThe you inside me is always crying. I wanted to wipe away your tears. But I never got to know the feeling of wiping the tears away fromyour soft cheeks.\u201d \u2013 Shin\u2019ichiro Nakagami\\n\\n\r\nThose first lines. Those sweet lines will reel you in instantly.\\n\\n\r\nIt was emotional. Most of it. The story was wonderful. It had a good beginning. And with each passing episode, you\u2019ll be wanting some more. But, unfortunately, when it got to the falling action, it made it less interesting. Truths are revealed, friendships got crushed. It was unexpectedly expected. When the Mugiha Festival came in, it will draw you in again. Then, after that, it will drive you back down. It had that intermittent up-and-down feel that will make you love and hate the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and two words: Bad Ending. Its ending was depressing. I hated it! Hate, hate, hate. I simply hated it. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, watch out for Raigomaru and Jibeta\u2019s story. It is heartwarming. It was impressive. Thumbs up on Shin-chan for that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)\\n\r\nP.A. Works. That\u2019s what encouraged me to watch True Tears. P.A. Works did an outstanding job animating Angel Beats!, so I thought that I should watch more animes produced by them. And it didn\u2019t fail me. The one thing that you will certainly love about True Tears is that its animation is perfectly done. Splashes of water, a chicken eating a sausage, a chicken flapping its wings, flowing of sweat, walking people with shadows following them, a motorcycle, basketballs, dancing with props, the sea: all of it was impressively done. Even the ending animation, where everybody was in chibi form, was very admirable. I expected nothing less from P.A. Works. Two thumbs up. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe music will carry you away. It fits the moment, and will really capture you. It really compensated the not-so-good plot of the series. Hajime Kikuchi is definitely the one to praise. \\n\\n\r\nAira Yuuki has a beautiful voice that sounds right for the ending theme. I like eufonius\u2019 opening theme, too. It was very melodious. But when I heard its instrumental, plus Hajime Kikuchi\u2019s numerous instrumentals of Reflectia (with a different title, but sounds about the same), it sounded much better. \\n\\n\r\nMy favourites would be (in order): Mujaki sa wo Senaka ni, Orange ga Ochite Iku Toki, Madobe ni mo Tareru Shoujo (Violin Ver.), Kagami, Kimi wo Utsushite, and Kokoro Kasanete. They were all very sweet and easy on the ears. Ichijin no Kaze sounds cool, too. And Aburamushi no Uta, Noe\u2019s song, is so adorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (3/10)\\n\r\nMost of them were awful. Really. The only character you\u2019d love is Noe. \\n\\n\r\nI found a photo in this link: http://i50.tinypic.com/2mfdg09.jpg. That actually sums up your description to the 5 main characters.\\n\\n\r\nShin\u2019ichiro was not very likeable. Yes, he\u2019s good-looking; Yes, he\u2019s nice. We already know male characters who are like that. And these male characters are oblivious to the feelings of the female characters around him. Sounds familiar? Yes. It does. That\u2019s why you\u2019re going to expect something different from him, something that will separate him from others. What you\u2019ll like about him though is that he is a writer in need of an inspiration. He wants to produce a story book. And as he meets Noe, he becomes motivated to continue on pursuing his dream.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters that didn\u2019t play big parts, but will make you hate them on purpose. Kanae, Aiko, Jun. They are just a few of the characters that you will dislike, no doubt about it. Noe was amazing and remarkable. She will touch your heart. She was really moving.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Shin\u2019ichiro\u2019s bestfriend, Nobuse Miyokichi, besides the fact that he was terrible at the beginning, will get you attached to him for the reason that he is going through an unrequited love. (Oh, you can relate? Lol.) \\n\\n\r\nI also wanted to see the other supporting characters a chance to get more exposure. I know they\u2019re just supporting characters, but they still deserve to be seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8/10)\\n\r\nAside from the negative parts of True Tears, you will enjoy watching it some ways you could not explain. There are funny scenes, there are heartbreaking scenes. It will surprise you that it managed to make you watch it up until the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (7/10)\\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s not as bad as it seems. All you need to give is the right appreciation. It may be that True Tears is not different from any other harems that you have watched from the past, but it still manages to separate itself from others. \\n",

            "content": "We all come into a new anime with our pre-conceived notions. In the case of romance anime, we all assume we can predict what will happen. Several girls vying for the affection of a clueless protagonist and a lot of unecessary drama occurs. \"Oh, a girl who can't shed tears needs to fall in love with a guy, so she can finally cry.\" I thought the premise was interesting, but I thought that True Tears would devolve into something we've seen time and time again.  With each passing episode, my assumptions were proven false. True Tears delivered a much more mature albeit melodramatic lookat high school romance. Still, even with its faults, True Tears deserves your attention.\\n\\n\r\nStory(7/10)- The story basically starts off like every other romance anime out there. Guy likes girl, guy is too scared to let girl know how he feels. Teenage angst ensues. But where True Tears deviates from the norm is in its execution. There is almost no comedy/fanservice, it strictly focuses on the feelings of the main 3 characters, Shinchiro, Noe and Hiromi. You are really able to empathize with the girls; you will be torn about who ends up with the MC. Where the story fails is in two places. First, the metaphorical usage of \"the chicken who could not fly.\" That part was poorly handled as it was a little hard to understand at certain points. I understand that it was supposed to represent the maturation of the MC. It was unecessarily artsy, and took away from the show. If I had a word to describe it, I would say 'misplaced.' \\n\\n\r\nMy second problem is the twist near the end of the show. We have a show that already was  semi-realistic but all of that was thrown out the window when the twist comes. I am not saying what happened is impossible, I just believe it is not plausible.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10)-The art is very crisp and beautiful. The drawings are meticulously detailed, and full of vibrant colors.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack(8/10)-The soundtrack is the standard romance anime affair. Full of moody soundscapes, tracks seeping with despair. It is good but nothing on it will make you say, \"Wow.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)-The cast of this show seems much more human than that of most romance anime. Every character here strays away from the typical archetypes: Tsundere, Kuudere and genki. I would like to say Noe, is one of the best love interests I have seen in a while. She displays a sway of different emotions, jealous, sadness, happiness. She was the most human of all. The MC was still displayed some ignorance, but not on the level of most romance anime. The only problem is that not all of the side characters are evenly developed. Unlike most romance anime, the parents actually have a significant role in the story. I found that to be surprising, but also refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, True Tears is a show that deserves your attention, especially if you are a romance-drama fan. I give True Tears an 8/10.",

            "content": "\u201cThe you within me is always crying. I have always wanted to wipe away your tears, but I cannot imagine the tenderness of wiping the tears from your face.\u201d \u2013 Shinichiro Nakagami\r\nI\u2019ve actually just watched True Tears for the third time, (I have the DVDs) and my opinion on the series has varied with each viewing. The first time I saw it, I thought it was breathtaking and heartwarming. The second time, cheesy and forced. After watching it a third time, I realize that although this series is definitely not for everyone, it displays a very interesting mixture of dream and reality that you don\u2019tfind in a lot of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers around high school student Shinichiro Nakagami, an aspiring artist who lives with his mother, his father, and the love of his life, Hiromi Yuasa, (left) who hasn\u2019t shown much happiness since she came to live with Shinichiro and his family. Loving Hiromi, chasing his dream, and being pressured by his family is tearing Shinichiro apart inside. Everything changes when he meets Isurugi Noe, (center) a very odd girl who claims that she has \u201cgiven her tears away.\u201d She tells Shinichiro that she must collect someone else\u2019s tears in order to be able to cry again, and he is, unfortunately, the prime candidate.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the entire storyline is a ton of metaphors thrown together. This is not necessarily a bad thing, nor is it a good thing. If anything, this series adds originality to every clich\u00e9 you would expect from a romantic harem drama. There are certain things that go unexplained, and certain things that seem to be tossed into the story in hopes of intensifying the mood. But overall, the way it was presented worked very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, especially the scenery, was probably the best part of this entire series. It was wonderfully animated, and most of the facial expressions of the characters were quite realistic for an animated series. I can vividly remember almost all of the background art in this anime. The scenery was so detailed and well-drawn that it\u2019s kind of hard to forget. The only problem I had as far as the art and animation was the excessive use of certain elements. There was a lot of fan service, (mostly from Hiromi) as well as an overuse of colored pencil freeze-frames and extreme close ups on people\u2019s lips. Sometimes it worked, but most of the time it was just kind of distracting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the series were very unrealistic, but in a way that makes you love every one of them. These are the kinds of people you only wish existed in real life, in that their emotions are more powerful than most people\u2019s, and these emotions are outwardly expressed through their actions. Sometimes, however, the characters personalities did seem a bit forced. It often seemed like the writers were trying too hard to make us feel sympathy for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe most well-done character by far was Isurugi Noe. Noe has a very childlike, free-spirited personality that\u2019s pretty much irresistible. Not only is she a very likeable character, but she is probably one of the only characters, other than the protagonist, that we actually get to watch grow from the beginning of the series to the end.\\n\\n\r\nI think you have to be a certain type of person to really enjoy this series. The main flaw in this series overall is that it was very, very cheesy. Therefore, in order to enjoy this series, you must be able to overcome the cheese. You have to be the kind of person who can relate to the characters, understand the metaphors, and apply the messages the anime portrays to your own life. If you\u2019re not the kind of person who connects to the shows you watch, this series is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nTrue Tears is definitely something special. It\u2019s a very lovely drama about struggles that a lot of teenagers have to face. This series can either be viewed as a powerful love story, or a melodramatic high school series. If you look past the all its flaws, True Tears can be viewed as one of the most unique dramatic harems to date.\\n",

            "content": "Alright this is for all my MAL viewers who see the reviews of this show and think \"Wow, this anime is rated pretty high. I'll check it out.\" Please don't. Just save yourself from a joke of an anime. This is the single trashiest anime I have ever watched and with good reason. What does this anime do well? The story? Absolute crap. The art? The 3D animation is funky and the art is whatever. The characters? Hell no. The only thing I somewhat enjoyed from this anime was the OP and eventual OSTs that popped up here and there throughout the series. I HATEDTHIS SERIES and you will too. \\n\\n\r\nOk let me be clear. The direction that the show wanted to follow regarding a girl and her trying to find her tears back was actually not bad. It makes up for somewhat a solid foundation for a romance story but wow. What a dumpster fire. Literally a dumpster fire. The execution and direction of this show was absolute crap. Literally the main girl rarely shows up and when she does, she's either\\n\r\n 1) Getting dumped by the MC \\n\r\n2) Getting roasted by Hiromi \\n\r\n3)Talking to her chickens\\n\r\nI think the storyboarder literally forgot who the main girl was and added a bunch of unnecessary crap. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are absolutely dreadful. They don't contain any special qualities nor are they executed well. The Main MC? He's a dumb dense wishy washy character who literally just likes Hiromi because she has big tits or something. I don't know what is going on with this guy's head. He has girls all over him and he doesn't even acknowledge their feelings and just ignores them. He think he's all righteous and cool even though he plays with the girl's hearts. Such a dumb MC. \\n\r\nHiromi? Oh man, don't get me started with her. She's actually the dumbest, most controlling character I have ever seen. Like bruh, the main MC ain't your play toy and what gives you the right to tell Noe to back off? You pushed off the MC in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nNoe is okay. She's strange a bit autistic at times but I feel like if someone had gone through what she gone through, they would be a little not quite right in the head. Man overall, I just can't get over the fact how trashy this anime is. Absolutely horrible execution and just poor characters. I have no clue why these MAL users are rating this trash so highly. It's such garbage and I hope this review gets on the front page so that people don't watch this horrendous clown fest. I had more fun studying than watch this crap. Trash trash trash 2/10(2 is because I feel a little nice today)",

The character Isurugi, Noe was really interesting and to be honest the only reason i kept watching the show, she was really one of the only things that made thisshow unique. Her involvement with the male lead Nakagami, Shinichiro was almost heart breaking at times, which is a credit to the writing. My issues with the show is that well there really wasn't enough of those super interesting moments that made me really care about the characters and i found myself sorta bored at times, So much so that i found myself more interested in how some of the supporting characters were doing. As for the ending without any spoilers, it just didn't cut it for me anyway, it was all to neat for lack of a better term. So would i suggest watching it, if your into Drama/Romance you not going to go horribly wrong with anime just don't expect it to eat your heart out, if your not into Drama/Romance avoid it, you will find yourself bored and uninterested pretty fast and with the slow moving plot i wouldn't expect to enjoy it\\n\r\nHope my review was helpful\\n\r\nMurphy      \\n",

            "content": "___________________________________________ Review the 3rd\r\nChihuahua Review(short&sweet): A dramatic, HIGH quality romance with an unexpected ending(maybe just me) that keeps on making me think of \"what if's\". \r\n------------------------------>In Depth Review:<------------------------\r\nSTORY: This romance is based around the main guy, Shinichiro witih the usual three girls fighting for his love. Wrong, one of them obviously has no chance. The the other two duke it out till the very end, which some say was not the prefered finish. However the rest of the story was pretty well done with an ordinary basis flourishing with great execution and \"flying\" and tears as the main theme here. In my opinion this isAir TV made the right way. Just watch both and compare.^_^\\n\\n\r\nART: Artsyle and Animation in this was amazing. The female cast was beautiful and one especially was incredibly moe.&gt;_&lt; There was a tad bit of fanservice(1-2scenes) but nothing so much that it becomes a nuisance. The CG(computer graphics) was used well and really blended in with the amazing background. The only complaint i have that prevented the art from being a ten was the blandness of the males in comparison to the girls. Also that other than Jun the cast looked a little young for high school. The art here could rival that of KyoAni's (there i said it)\\n\r\n;)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I really liked the entire opening it really set up each episode. I don't think i've skipped it during the time i watched the series. The Cockroach Song was also  pretty important even though it wasnt really a song. It worked really well in some of the dramatic scenes. Voice acting was great so i cant say much about it. The ED in this show was passable but i didn't really listen to it until after the show since i kept on wandering on to the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: There was actually a fair amount of developement among the characters considering it was such a short series. However despite a plethora of wavering hearts and incestual obstacles the show was able to finish smoothly. With this said the characters may or may not be so likeable except maybe for ONE. :) Really interesting how they used both a childhood friend and philosophical moe girl in one series. Tough Matchup XD.\\n\\n\r\nENJOIMENT: I enjoyed this thoroughly even with my slight dissatisfaction at the end. Right now it seems to be an underrated show but it is definately worth a watch. One of the few shows that made me shed actually shed a tear. If you enjoi romance then dont consider this just watch it. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Debatable ending(debate with me if u want XD) but great everything else. No reason to hate and even with its short span it feels longer than 13episodes.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: If you like romance harems or romances in general watch this. If you liked this then watch any of KyoAni's anime or ef-a tale of memories.\\n\\n\r\nIf you dissagreed OR agreed fully with me on anything feel free to message me and discuss it. Always fun. @_@\\n\\n\r\nWoofWoof",

            "content": "The main problem with True tears is that nothing really happens at all. Most of the drama either comes from literally retarded decisions that the characters take, or plot devices (the main guy's mum).\r\nThe story starts with an internal monologue that doesn't really mean anything and is not something anyone would think, which already sets the tone for the rest of the show. We see who main guy likes, main guy also meets new girl (Noe) and they talk about flying and a chicken who no one cares about so the whole scene is boring.-----Spoilers ahead-----\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe chicken later dies and main guy is meant to replace him in order to give his tears to Noe. It was already irritating to me how seriously the main character took this \"giving tears to someone\" crap, but then Noe decided it was a good idea to annoy main guy by giving him chicken seeds and embarrassing him by waving at him and following him around. This makes main guy justifiably angry at Noe and he confronts her about it. However Noe hurts herself jumping down a tree,so she uses main guy by making him carry her when she is fine and then for some reason Noe annoying main guy is forgotten. Then main guy stumbles upon his love interest saying she likes Noe's brother (a lie, duh).\\n\\n\r\nI think a bit after that, Noe's siscon brother tells main guy that he will do whatever he wants in exchange for him dating Noe. This leads to the most fucking retarded decision done in the entire series, which was comedy gold to me: The main guy tells the brother to date his love interest in exchange for him dating Noe, whom he doesn't like at the present. He is even shown to be mad at them dating.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that main guy's love interest tells him that they're brothers because of an affair his dad had. This turns out to be a lie that main guy's mum (who acts like a bitch for most of the show) made up because reasons. Later on, when main guy momentarily gains a neuron he asks his dad who says its a lie and then the mum randomly turns into a better person because who cares anyway.\\n\\n\r\nNoe and main guy started dating after main guy thought he was his love interest's brother, however when thats cleared up he starts dating his initial love interest, who now lives alone (which is kinda cool tbh).\\n\\n\r\nStuff happens and we reach the main guy's relationships climax, which is actually a good scene, where he cries while telling Noe that he doesn't love her (he cries because Noe actually impacted his life in a good way in the end, more than the other love interest did). \\n\\n\r\nOne of the few parts of the show that could've had promise was the relationship of main guy and the 2 dating people. However, of course, the girl actually likes main guy. This raises the question of why she even accepted dating the other guy-it turns out that the 2 guys asked very nicely and since the girl is retarded (like many other characters in this show) she accepted. This is one of the instances of drama being created (between the 2 guys and girl) due to a retarded decision.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully at the end the other 2 decide to give dating another try or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and opening song are good, however they don't compensate for the plethora of boring or not-funny dumb scenes. If you haven't already, don't watch this show.\\n",

            "content": "&ldquo;True Tears&rdquo; managed to grab from the first episode on due to its more serious themes and the different situations the characters find themselves in, which are not as shallow or simple as they sometimes can be. Especially the Nakagami family situation, and those some of the other characters are in lean closer to more plausible life situations and help make those characters less two dimensional. Not all is black and white, but more grey. \r\nThis continues throughout the series for several of the plots and characters involved, especially Hiromi and Aiko are slightly more complex and realistic characters.\r\nBeing more of a romance/harem series orromantic drama, it does not forego the classic theme of all (or most) of the female characters having feelings for the male leading character. Although from the very first episode there's strong hints that &ldquo;True Tears&rdquo; has a 'fated' pairing, one which seems to be the only possible outcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe main theme surrounding Neo who 'gave away her tears' is offfered as the central thread throughout the series but is little more than a gimmick for the series to differentiate itself from similar titles and serves as metaphor for the characters to express their feelings and emotional quests.\\n\r\nFar more interesting is the theme involving the chicken that Neo adores, and the ability to fly. This translates into the picture book Shinichiro strives to create. A metaphor for him being able to move forward and break away from the emotional burdens he has by growing past them. The same goes for the other characters, Hiromi, Neo, Aiko and Miyokichi.\\n\r\nIn that aspect, &ldquo;True Tears&rdquo; mainly deals with growth, adulthood and change. Being able to grow past emotionally stressful circumstances, from verbal abuse and emotional rejection at home, to unrequited love, social isolation at school,...\\n\r\nA theme that plenty of series touch upon, but is done so fairly well here because it touches some more realistic situations, which also makes them a bit more melodramatic at times and as such both brings with it a positive note as well as a negative one.\\n\\n\r\nNeo who's most often displayed as the token weird girl character, is the one who spurs most others to grow and change, to break free from the situations they may seem stuck in.\\n\\n\r\nShinichiro's character evolution is a bit more classic, the young lad who is oblivious to some of the inner feelings of those around him and who seeks to stretch out and lead a life that satisfies him as he feels pushed into doing things he himself hasn't really desired. Eventually he matures and discovers that even the traditional Japanese folk dance he was forced to study and participate in, is a rewarding experience and allows him to make a new memory with Hiromi. This is seldom seen, as in most series he would just become a rebellious character that breaks free yet here the end result is more realistic. He does things he didn't want to do originally and comes to appreciate some and learns from others.\\n\\n\r\nHiromi was to me by far the most interesting and realistic character. While able to be more of herself at school, mostly thanks to playing at the basketball club, she was forced to endure a lot of emotional stress at home. She has been living in Shinichiro's family after her parents passed away but was often verbally abused or reprimanded by Shinichiro's mother and had to seal away her own feelings of affection for Shinichiro that she carried since childhood. She grows past that struggle and moves out to live by herself, she overcomes those hurdles and can finally confess her feelings for Shinichiro and become closer to him. Along the way her character had some of the most realistic evolution and scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEven though Aiko has a crush on Shinichiro, which puts stress on her relationship with Miyokichi , the boy she subsequently breaks up with, realizing her feelings are unrequited she grows past it and eventually starts over with Miyokichi. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is solid throughout most episodes with particular attention to subtle facial expressions which greatly help give it a more realistic atmosphere. Most characters have realistic hairstyles and colors while still remaining recognizable.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is decent, with a cute opening song. It does not particularly excel but accentuates scenes and moods where needed.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you like romantic series and can appreciate them being just a bit more serious and realistic without becoming heavy, then I recommend &ldquo;True Tears&rdquo;.",

            "content": "\u201cBecause I gave my tears away.\u201d\r\nThat was the line that first introduced me to True Tears. Now I would like to use this same line to introduce you all to this realistic romance series. The True Tears legacy began with very disappointing visual novel sales that ranked it as 41 among the 50 newly released visual novels at the time. Shortly after the visual novel came a live action film of True Tears that resembles closely to the game. So now you must thinking the anime is naturally just another adaptation to the visual novel as well right? Wrong!\r\nThe anime version of True Tears sharesnothing in common with the visual novel or the film (beside the name). It has its own independent plot, its own independent setting, and its own independent set of characters. Thus why use the name True Tears and give credit to the original visual novel creator when there is virtually nothing in common is beyond my understanding. However, what I do understand is that True Tears is an attempt by Lantis to produce a similar anime type to Air/Kanon/Clannad by Kyoto Animation. The purpose of this review is not to compare and criticize True Tears with the above anime, but I personally feel True Tears is worthy of such comparison if there is one.\\n\\n\r\nMany viewers may find the story of True Tears resembling Kanon or Clannad in lots of ways, such as the usual touching scenes that make us cry a river. However due to the nature of the story, instead of dealing with half a dozen heroines we only have three. Thus allowing more time to better develop their characters. One may be tempted to call True Tears a harem anime due to all the females \u201cganging\u201d up on our protagonist, but I see this as an essential part to developing a love-triangle (and NO, there\u2019s nothing ecchi in the anime). The anime takes a rather different approach to the regular love story and one can say it truly brings out the realism to this matter through the careful use of wordings. However it should be noted that, like most other story with a certain degree of depth, True Tears incorporates a great deal of metaphoric comparison. While it is not difficult to understand what those metaphors imply, some viewers may be discouraged by them.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationships between all the characters are expertly developed. In addition to the multi layer relations that are common in most romance genre, we also see a great deal of interactions between the younger and older generation of characters and how they affect one another. The protagonist\u2019s parents certainly played a more central role compare with most animation from this genre. However, what I like best is the perfect illustration of a young boy\u2019s heart when confronted with two (or three) possible lovers. I, for one, instantly saw a reflection of myself from Shinichirou (not that I am two-timing or anything, but I find his actions highly logical for a boy his age). I think I would most likely be as confused (if not more confused) than he is if I were in his situation especially after all those shocking events.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise it certainly lives up to fans expectations. This is especially true for the key scenes of the show. As evident from the title of the anime, tears do truly seem different in here. Tears in True Tears are very beautiful, the glittering salty water look exceptionally real when running down the cheeks of various characters. In addition to tears, the fluidity of the character movements, the detailed shadows on the face of the characters as they speak, the camera angles used to illustrate certain key aspects such as the 3D walking scene etc.; everything adds up little by little and before you know it you will find yourself having a hard time reverting back to watching lower quality animations. I still have a difficult time trying to find a show with superior animation quality compare to True Tears.\\n\\n\r\nLike the awesome animation production, True Tears\u2019 music is also not to belittled with. The music was effectively used both in terms of BGM and OP/ED as they all served their purposes well. BGM creates the mood just needed to make some scenes touching enough to make people go teary-eyed. The OP is by eufonius whom Clannad fans should be familiar with. I personally find True Tears\u2019 OP much better than Clannad\u2019s though. Unlike most anime, True Tears\u2019 seiyu did not interest me much (nor did they play any role in my decision to watching it). The biggest name out of the main casts is probably Kaori Nazuka (Nunnally in Code Geass, Eureka in Eureka Seven, Lynette in Strike Witches). With that note, I would like to truly thank the Lantis production crew for bringing us (the anime fans) a wonderful romance series that will forever have a place in my anime romance list.",

            "content": "True tears is a story that focuses on the life of a high school student and his interactions with the three heroines of the story. The story focuses on the romance and drama in the lives of the characters.\r\nI think that the storyline was one of the best i have seen for a 13 episode anime. It was just the right length for such a story. The anime incorporates a lot of realism and really brings out the drama of a love triangle. The story looks at love from a path less ventured on and is different from your typical love story. Some may callthis a harem because all the main girls fall in love with the main character but it is very different from your usual harem because it looks at it from a more realistic and serious angle. Expect a lot of drama and meaning in this show. Though a word of caution that this show is a bit enigmatic due to its metaphorical usage of &quot;chickens flying&quot; and a strange and unique theme of tears. But you'll catch on eventually so do not fret even if you do not understand at first.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was simply amazing. The backgrounds and sceneries were drawn with such vibrance and the colours were vivid and easy on the eyes. The use of watercolour in the show by the main character also brings out a very nice animation feel to the show. One of the best artworks in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was so-so. What really stood out were the voice actors. Especially the four main characters. They played the characters so well and i think it really contributed to the feel of the anime. Inserts were made towards the end which helped to create the atmosphere and i think the OP song was very suited for this anime. It's good but not the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were also very well done. Each having a good deal of depth for such a short anime series. Espcially since there were quite a few main characters, to cover such a wide range of characters in such a short span is quite good. Perhaps a bit more focus on the side characters like the two best friends of the lead girl and guy would have been good, but considering the time span i guess it's still ok. The characters were also not your usual cliche characters in a romance anime, especially Noe, to have such a character in the show makes it more unique and unpredictable.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime for its romance and drama. But it was lacking in the comedy area. But i guess it's ok since the drama was brought out pretty well as a result. Thus the story may appear a bit gloomy. It was also a bit slow at the start but the pace picks up as the story goes, so for those who are impatient you might have trouble with this anime at the start. However, i think the anime was very meaningful because you can sympathize with the characters and is thus very attention grabbing at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, This anime is not to be missed. Especially if you are a romance-drama fan. The anime managed to portray many key elements in the show within the short time span and i think that the anime will leave a lasting impression on all who watch it. However, patience may be needed in the course of undertsanding the story and the characters. If you are looking for something more light-hearted then perhaps you may not find this to you liking.\\n\\n",

            "content": "True Tears is a fairly typical Slice of Life, Romance, Comedy, Drama based on an unusual theme of tears (amongst other things). From the beginning the story is pretty ordinary, for this type of anime, as it has a male protagonist (Shinichirou) and it introduces him, his surroundings and the heroines involved in the story (Noe, Hiromi & Aiko). However it is really difficult to tell what the story is entirely about or where it is headed, until things reach a certain point. That is when some major developments arise but it\u2019s a shame that the series is almost half over by that point.\r\nHere wehave the usual stock of high school boys and girls for characters and there\u2019s nothing really particularly special about them. However a few of them have something unique about them that allows them stand out (Noe). But the character relations are what make the characters interesting because other than the simple-minded guys; the girls add a bit of perplexity to the mix as you cannot be entirely sure of what their true and honest feelings are.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the series I can definitely say that the animation is the most outstanding aspect of this anime series, as it utilizes superb environments, well-drawn characters and well placed but somewhat overused CG effects/models. The most noticeable feature is the backgrounds, which looks like it was painted using soft water colours and it seamlessly blends well with the fluid foreground animations.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is composed of a variety of piano and violin symphonies that works well with the laid-back nature of the show. It also does a good job in setting the mood for some drama but the weak dialogue doesn\u2019t help whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nOverall True Tears proved to be a great romance anime, for all the romance anime lovers who need their seasonal fix. There are some surprisingly good aspects to the show, which allow it to easily overshadow the major downfalls like the male cast. The humour in the beginning does help set this up to be an enjoyable series but like always expect to see some major drama. So if you\u2019re into this type of romance anime then make sure you check it out.",

            "content": "True Tears was an anime adaptation of visual novel of the same name.  Although, I&rsquo;m hesitant in calling it an adaptation as True Tears the anime has nothing in common with the game.  The story, characters, setting, and even the themes employed are different from the game version, with the exception of the name.  I was initially excited a few years ago when I heard about it, but when I heard how poorly the game was received I had extremely low expectations.  Thankfully, the anime was also extremely different in terms of quality.    \r\nThe story itself is extremelytypical of the romance genre.  However, it is told in an extremely realistic and down-to-earth manner.  Just reading the summary of True Tears gives one this impression.  In addition, so are the characters, you won&rsquo;t find any goddess, aliens, espers, or time travelers (and no, I&rsquo;m not making a Haruhi reference) here, instead our cast is filled with normal people.  I sometimes forget that I&rsquo;m watching an anime as they rarely use animation conventions, such as speed lines, exaggerated expressions, etc.  So one may wonder, &ldquo;why should I watch this, the summary and even you are saying that it isn&rsquo;t a very unique story?&rdquo;  Well, it is true, I won&rsquo;t deny that, but what makes True Tears are the incredibly deep and complex character as well as the extremely subtlety in which the story is told.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, True Tears is told in an extremely consistent manner with near perfect pacing.  After a few episodes, once the introductions are done, the story builds upon itself and has a satisfying conclusion.  However, True Tears has an interesting story structure.  For True Tears the climax and the falling action, or the ride down, didn&rsquo;t happen all in the last 2 episodes.  Instead the climax of the various story threads happened around episodes 6-8 thus, giving them plenty of time to resolve everything.  However, not all of the story threads exhibited a very smooth falling action in particular, the main one and thus True Tears suffered a bit near the end.  Nevertheless during episodes 9-13, all of those threads were resolved, with the major ones being resolved during the last episode.  Although this can be seen as a negative as it doesn&rsquo;t keep the excitement up till the end.  For many single kour anime series the climax happens in the 2nd to last episode (2-3 before the end for 2 kour series).  Once again this makes thing exciting up to the end but it puts too much stress on the last episode to resolve everything.  Because of the way the story was told, True Tears didn&rsquo;t end with a bang, instead it ends with on a whimper.  It is possible for True Tears to end on an extremely dramatic note, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be true to itself.  That is a very down to earth, subtle anime.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, True Tears is more of an ensemble than a harem, as there are 6 major characters (3 male, 3 female) with a focus on Shinichiro, Hiromi, and Noe.  Also, despite there being 6 major character and 13 episodes they all had sufficient character development and depth.  In addition, all the characters are flawed and very much human.  These are characters I can identify with and understand.  However, because of this it makes some characters not as likeable.  In a way, the characters are painfully too human.  In addition, the character that really surprised me was Miyokichi, the seemingly token male friend.  Characters like this are primarily used as comedic side characters, for example Sunohara in Clannad.  Miyokichi is nothing like this, he received quite a bit of depth and complexity reserved only for main characters in most other series. \\n\\n\r\nAnother big surprise was the quality of the animation.  PA works was a completely unknown studio and produced something on the level of KyoAni.  In some ways surpass them on certain aspects.  For example, in the basketball scene in Clannad (by KyoAni) uses many speed lines, a perfectly normal anime convention to convey high speed/movement, not just KyoAni, most studios do this.  In True Tears the players actually move and the use of the camera is something akin to what I like to call, Itano circus for basketball.  Not only that the world in True tears is very much alive, as there are people, animals, etc that are constantly moving in the background.  Sure they use CG for the people walking in the background but it is done in a way where its hardly noticeable.  Also, the attention to detail that PA works put into True Tears is beyond ridiculous.  For example, the snow, the way it is spread is extremely realistic as well as being realistically dirty.  However, the most definitive scene for me was the dance near the end of the series.  Not only are all the dancers different they are just slightly and realistic out of sync.  As for the art, it was actually pretty unique, most of the time there is a slight softness in the backgrounds.  Not on the same level as Honey and Clover but enough to give it a slight picture book feel.  Another distinct point in the art was the use of dramatized shots that look exactly like Shinichiro&rsquo;s art book.    This is something that kind of bothers me, as it stood out too much.  It is possible that it is relates to the picture book Shinichiro is writing, either way I wasn&rsquo;t too fond of it.  Is PA Works another KyoAni?  Maybe, we&rsquo;ll have to see if they can keep up the quality.          \\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice work was quite exceptional and kept with the overall subtlety of the series.  Music is held back and is rarely in-your-face.  The OP Reflictia by Eufonius has officially made me a fan of her work.  As for the ending, nothing special, the chibi characters walking across the screen was&hellip;interesting.  It feels a bit out of place considering the overall tone of the series.  The voice actors did an amazing job and in particular I was quite impressed with Hiromi&rsquo;s VA.  Her VA did an amazing job conveying the sadness and restrain of Hiromi.\\n\\n\r\nI only have one real complaint for True Tears.  As I mentioned above the falling action for the main story thread wasn&rsquo;t very smooth.  This is because I believe the writers got trapped into a classic romance convention.  That is holding off who the main character picks until the very end and this is perfectly understandable as they want to keep the viewer excited till the end.  This is not necessary be a bad thing but it damages Shinichiro&rsquo;s character by making him indecisive and thus hurting the ones around him.    That&rsquo;s why I wasn&rsquo;t as happy with the one or two episodes before the final episode.  However, its not like we didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking and there were clues point in one direction, its just that they kept it a bit too ambiguous.  This resulted in mixed interpretation and frustration when one&rsquo;s predictions failed.  \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe True Tears, I would say &ldquo;subtle.&rdquo;  Just about everything about this anime is subtle, from the way the characters talk to their actions.  This anime will have you constantly thinking between the lines to really understand what is going on.  Once again this is both a strength and weakness as some viewers may simply miss important clues.  In addition, they employ several interesting themes and metaphors, for example, Shinichiro&rsquo;s picture book, flying, and &lsquo;true tears.&rsquo;  I could easily write pages analyzing these themes but, since this is a review on the anime I won&rsquo;t.  So if you are the type to watch anime for relaxation purposes or with your brain turned off, then cross True Tears off your &ldquo;to watch or interested list&rdquo;, this anime is not for you.  Ok, let me rephrase that, the beauty of True Tears comes from it&rsquo;s subtly and depth, something that cannot be appreciated by watching on a superficial level.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, let me say that this review is at least twice as long as I planned.  I guess it only shows how much I enjoyed this series as I couldn&rsquo;t stop typing.",

            "content": "The first line of the show is your very typical drama-like statement, \"The you inside me is always crying\". Little did you know is that the Shinichiro was talking about the viewer and how much you wanted to cry after watching this show. You're not crying because your sad, and definitely not because you're happy, but because your body is so full with rage that tears have to be removed to make room for more rage.\r\nSpoilers galore in here.\r\nLet's go over the plot, oh goody, I wonder what kind of plot they have in store. Nakagami Shinichiro lives with his mother, his father, and hisadopted sister. Of course, Shinichiro and his adopted sister, Yuasa Hiromi, are very distant under the same roof. Then he meets another girl, Isurugi Noe, and then you meet his childhood friend, Ai-chan which are thrown in for an unnecessary love-triangle.\\n\\n\r\nBy the first two episodes, it's very obvious that Shinichiro and Hiromi like each other, but of course, they're forbidden to love each other due to complications in their family situation. Shinichiro doesn't want to admit it. Hiromi thinks that Shinichiro is her brother. Don't worry, I'll get to that in a moment. Just let me take my time. So, Shin-dope meets newcomer Noe-chan who thinks that male lead is the one that can get her tears back. The first broken plot device. Then Hiromi likes to complicate things even farther by saying to Shin-dope that she doesn't like him, it's conveniently Noe's brother.\\n\\n\r\nShin-dope and Noe become such good friends that Noe's brother somehow tracks Shin-man down to his address and asks him to go out with Noe. Shin-man, being the brilliant idealist that he is, thinks it would be best to make a contract with her shady brother. \"You go out with Hiromi, I'll go out with Noe!\". Second broken plot device. I mean, what was the purpose of this deal? What would this deal accomplish? Noe's brother gets what he wanted for a price. Hiromi gets burdened for making things complicated and conveniently made room for broken plot devices. So then Nii-chan and Hiromi go out. Then it takes Shin-man forever to make his move on his side of the contract. A contract that was never written and never specified. So Hiromi and other guy awkwardly make fake romance so Shin-man will make his move. For some reason, the awkward-fake couple can't break up because that'll break the contract. Supposedly. The viewer is somehow supposed to know that.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of the contract is somewhat baffling to  me as I cannot figure out the terms of the contract or why the contract was made in the first place. These two guys go out of their way to make a contract on other's personal lives and then make it so that they're connected like a mirror. \"If I do this, you do it too!\". This doesn't work in anyway and only further prevents Shin-man and Hiromi to be more awkward with each other. Great, I missed the best part of this anime... because the first four episodes with them two had so much magic that I just couldn't handle it.\\n\\n\r\nBecause Hiromi has no depth as a character, the writers thought that the only way people would like Hiromi would be to create sympathy from the viewer. Which is the third broken plot device. Shinichiro's mother hates Hiromi because she's not her daughter. When she first moves in, years before the show starts, she claims that [Hiromi's mother] cheated on [Hiromi's father] with [Shinichiro's father] to create her. That would make Shinichiro and Hiromi siblings. The fourth broken plot device. Now they feel even more awkward around each other. There is so much magic between the two, I feel like this is a Disney movie!\\n\\n\r\nThe role of Shinichiro's mother is baffling too. She goes so much out her way to make Hiromi feel unwanted. By episode-whatever,  we learn that the might be sibling's thing is a lie. The mother even went so out of her way to back-up that lie that she cut out [Hiromi's mother's] face out of pictures. But then she turns around and begins to treat Hiromi like one of her own after she gets into a bike accident and tarnishes her new family's name. So when Hiromi didn't do anything wrong, she was hated, but when she runs away and gets into an accident and suspended from school she's then rewarded with love. Huh? I mean, what was the mother's motive in the first place? What did Hiromi's mother do to her that she had to make up such an absurd story? This is when the show becomes damaged beyond repair. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character that baffles me is Ai-chan, the childhood friend that is dating Shin-dope's best friend. Her character doesn't baffle me, it's the reason why she's in this show that baffles me. She's basically there to add extra drama to the fake drama. She likes Shin-dope (and who doesn't at this point?) and kisses him while she's dating his best friend, who is a much better guy than Shin-guy.  But thankfully she dumps the other guy and decides to move on from Shin-dude anyway. Crisis averted.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we know that Shin-dude and Hiromi aren't siblings. You can finally sleep at night and call the right name of the girl you're sleeping with. Oh. Wait. There's two broken plot devices in the way. The contract and a sweet girl named Noe. Noe and Shin-moron are now going out and Shin-idiot actually draws a picture book about it. A picture book about the chicken that could fly. But then the chicken couldn't fly because his adopted sister is now just his adopted sister. So now he thinks he has a shot with Hiromi. Which now Shin-shin and Hiromi are never awkward because of this. In fact, I was never sure why these two liked each other anyway besides the fact that they're both attractive. They never talked under the same roof, and they don't even know each other. Hell, Hiromi even says it in some episode, \"I never got to know you after all this time\". So that implies they never got to know each other. Meanwhile, Shinichiro and Noe have a pretty good thing going. But Shinichiro now thinks that \"Now is the time to take flight\" and let's his hormones run wild and chases after Hiromi as she is moving away to an apartment to live on her own.  When they meet up, the dumbest line in the show is said. \"I'll do everything proper from now on\". As if anything Shin-moron had done before was proper (if you need a hint, nothing so far has been proper and will continue not to be proper). What Shin-chan means by that, I don't even know. And while these two are hugging in the middle of the street. That contract is still in effect because neither of them have broken-up with Noe's brother or Noe. \\n\\n\r\nHell, Noe and her brother seem more in love with each other than any other relationship in the series. Maybe that should be the plot. The forbidden love between those two. Then the less interesting Hiromi and Shin-idiot could get in the way. It could be called \"True Incest\". Instead of this fast one they pulled on me.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Hiromi now lives alone and we get to see her do splits. The most enticing part of the show. Now that the two lovebirds are separated, their love becomes deeper and more intense. Even though their in the same class and they don't know each other.\\n\\n\r\nSo now it's time for the festival dance and time to tell Noe that he and Hiromi are now in love. Oh goody, let's see how our brilliant idealist goes about doing this. He dances and then Hiromi tells Noe, and I quote, to \"leave them alone\". As far as I'm concerned, Noe was placed into the situation because of Hiromi being a bitch all the time. She never liked Noe in the first place because she was friends with Shin-moron. Then she's the cause of Shin-moron making the contract that automatically pulls her into the situation. So now, Noe is intentionally placed in the middle of these two idiots, and their insecurities, as an obstacle and they treat her like she's done something wrong. This causes her to test flying, in result, breaking her leg from jumping off a tree. Shin-moron then gets angry at Noe and tosses the picture book in the ocean, a page at a time to make it look artsy. I skipped over the last episodes, so I don't even know if Noe got her tears back. Probably not. Why did Hiromi think it was okay to just take Shin-moron's responsibility and just do it all herself? Who wrote this ****?\\n\\n\r\nThe art was okay. The 3D was clunky looking while students were walking out. The 3D Shinichiro didn't even look like the animated one. Animation was okay. I don't remember listening to any music, because the voices in my head were fighting due to this show. The ED and OP were okay though.\\n\\n\r\nTo add, the most interesting characters we ain't seen enough of. Miyokichi, Shin-moron's best friend, and Noe. This show goes downhill fast after episode seven, and I would never recommend this trash to anyone. This show lied to me like my ex-girlfriends did. Leaving me doubtful and upset. At the end, I found myself lost and confused and I lost faith in love, friendship, everything. I had to make sure I didn't lose my soul due to this show. Then I looked at the reviews of this show and I also found myself baffled about how people give this show anything more than a five. \\n\\n\r\nThings just don't add up. This show has a plot that is more convenient then the laptop in my bathroom.\\n\\n",

Works' debut anime as a solo independent company. It wasn't based on a manga, light novel, visual novel, anything, it was a original production. Because of this, the studio was considered careless by a considerate percentage of the critics, however, this helped increasing the series' audience at its premier, it was an audacious move after all. With the show progressing and popularity constantly increasing, it prof itself a well played market strategy. \r\nThen, someone might say \"What is it worthbeing a original production if it's crap?\" \\n\r\nInteresting point. There's no merit at all in creating a story that won't live up to viewers expectations. \\n\r\nLuckily, True Tears doesn't fall into that trap. It might not work for everyone but it is, undeniably, a well elaborated and carefully conducted story.\\n\r\nYes. I'm well aware I just poked a sore spot. Unlike what the previously lines stated, lots of people consider its story to be a huge failure, blaming character development to be the villain of it. Unrealistic characters, patterned story, flat personalities, are just some of the major criticisms this anime receives. They aren't completely wrong, and of course, each of us has our own opinion, however these statements are focusing into small flaws and turning them into huge plot holes without taking in consideration the environment surround it. Meaning: Other elements of the storyline and small pieces of character dialogues which explains and corrects those \"mistakes\" so that when you see the final product, all the pieces must be visualized together and these flaws becomes invisible. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a misunderstanding to label True Tears as a Harem to start of. Harem series, for the ones who aren't familiar with it, are those stories where the main male lead is surrounded by girls -all in love with him- and the protagonist can't make up his mind, because he enjoys his situation or for pure hesitation. Somebody who watches the first 2 episodes of True Tears will notice that this anime isn't about it. \\n\r\nJust like that, I would humbly ask you to NOT take in consideration the series summary here in MAL. Clearly who wrote it didn't watch the complete series (besides from spoiling the entire first episode).\\n\\n\r\nTrue Tears strong attribute is the Drama, with Romance as a important side-kick of it. After all, a emotional loaded series without heartwarming moments would be just too painful to watch.\\n\r\nThe story progresses exploring inner conflicts of the characters, set with situations from their past strongly represented through metaphors and subtext that will require some Pause-Play action in order to fully understand it. \"The Tale of Raigomaru and Jibeta\" was sure the ace in the pocket of producers. \\n\r\nIt's nice to emphasize the symbolism of it. The anime was structure in a way both stories (The actual main one and the fictional Raigomaru's) are developed independently. However, they are joint in the meaning, and Raigomaru's is constantly influenced by the outcome of events on characters life's. \\n\r\nJust like that, I was impressed how this show managed to represent characters reactions to events on the story in a perfect \"human\" way. It's well known, that drama series are often criticized because of strong emotionally packet scenes suddenly followed by easygoing everyday events as if nothing happened, leaving that sour taste on the mouth. True Tears escape from this pattern, as Raigomaru's Tale shows and the same applies for other characters as well. Hiromi performance on her basketball practices, Noe's berries, etc...\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to misunderstand True Tears characters. Specially if one listen to a friend who watched it or reads about it somewhere. Even reading these reviews might change the way someone interprets them. Hopefully to a better one.\\n\r\nThese characters personalities are way more complex than what we're used to, and the reason why they can't be simply explained is because production succeeded at making some really realistic characters. However, the challenge of an advance like this is too keep every character on the same level of complexity, otherwise, some would become flat and others way too dense. And... this is what happened. Not to mention supportive characters were completely neglected, although this is still acceptable due to the focus of the anime.\\n\r\nUsing the three main characters as an example, Hiromi and Shinichiro background story was well structured and understanding the reason of some of their actions would require a deeper commitment from the side of the viewers. On the other hand, Noe's character, besides of her background story, was way too simplistic when compared to others, without a further development, only receiving producers \"attention\" at the end of the series. This creates a contrast that completely ruined the enjoyment for some people, turning what would be a great drama/romance into a hateful/psychological (Huh, dejav\u00fa Makoto-san).\\n\r\nStill, on the overall, the job done specially with Hiromi character was marvelous. That said, in my personal opinion, character is worth a 9 out of 10 since, like said previously, the final piece hides these mistakes. You know they're there, but they don't affect the enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Artwork were really smoothy. Being it a drama it was expected that characters expressions would be carefully animated and so it happened. Also worth mention the quality of small details like snow flakes, leaves and sea water sparks but above all, this anime really represented its name. True Tears had one of the best Tears animation I've ever seen. It is not rare to find series with horrible \"eye sweat\" animations. It was a surprise to see how well drawn they were.\\n\\n\r\nSound, music, OST, openings, casting... deserves nothing but praise. The seyuus chosen for this series fit perfectly to their characters. The OST written for it was also outstanding. Emotional packed violins and pianos but also acoustic guitars for happy funky scenes. Reflectia (the opening theme) even did recently a cameo appearance on P.A. Works most recent anime TariTari. Only thing I missed tough was the small number of insert songs. Just a couple of them.\\n\r\nHowever, analyzing the songs shouldn't be limited to just saying if they are good or bad, one important aspect of it is timing and placement. A insert song placed at an awkward moment can easily ruins the entire mood of a scene. True Tears didn't have problems with it. OST was perfect placed, something that greatly increases the emotional value of certain scenes.\\n\r\n-A notorious example of it would be the last scenes of episode 6.-\\n\\n\r\nStill, the most impressive about this anime is related to its story. \\n\r\nIts plot and script is way stronger and denser than lots of drama/romance series similar to it, however, it doesn't tries to impose feelings on you. It might make you shed some tears but it isn't a constant machine gun of feelings. You may end up thinking \"Oh man, this is sad\" but it stops at it, through the entire series there isn't a scene that you can notice it was prolonged to induce the viewers to cry or something similar.\\n\r\nIn the place of it, P.A Works built a compelling storyline, that keeps you entertained and curious to known what will happen next, what will a certain character do and how it gonna end. Specially how it gonna end, since the final conclusion was marvelous hidden till the very end.  \\n\r\nThis is a series I'd strongly recommend watching for a second time in order to fully understand it.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that is lovely about these romance anime it that you always get attached to the story and in most of the times, when there's a love polygon, you start cheering for a character/couple. The satisfaction of seeing your favorite character achieving his/her goal or the sadness of a misfortune is part of it. \\n\r\nIt's silly to bias the final enjoyment rating on this character success/failure, what matters is that the series managed to keep you entertained the whole time!\\n\r\nStory 9 / Character 9 / Art 8 / Sound 9 / Enjoyment 10 = Arithmetic Overall: 9\\n\\n\r\nTrue Tears, for me, was a masterpiece.\\n\r\nBut, c'mon. They could've picked a better name.",

            "content": "Complete and utter disappointment is what made me write this review, therefore making the show probably sound worse than it actually is, or is it?\r\nIf you're thinking about watching True Tears, then let me give you a warning not to expect too much of it, for that was my mistake right from the start. \r\nThe series began, for my taste, extremely promising and I couldn't wait for the second episode, but alas it was late and myself tired, so the only way to proceed was to sleep and watch the rest of the show the next day in one go. Little I new in myenthusiasm that I'd have to force myself to sit through the rest of the 12 episodes by drinking till I almost passed out. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I remember clearly about the first episode was the \u201eKyaa! Ecchi!\u201c-thing. I thought \u201ewow, using a clich\u00e9 from the harem-genre and putting it in a more realistic scenario, that's nice!\u201c. I expected then an intelligent change from your everyday harem-anime looked at by a more realistic angle...and somehow I got it, but with a cast where I don't even know which character I hated the most. \\n\\n\r\nThe creators of True Tears should have been so honest to tell me poor soul that this show takes place on planet \u201eSadist IV\u201c where everyone, first and foremost the females, are committed to lie and hurt others whenever possible. If that would have been made clear I could understand why nobody seems to care about being treated this way. But for me, accustomed to modern earthly standards of not being an asshole, I just don't get it. \\n\\n\r\nOne character especially deserving of my hatred is Shinichiro's mother. Why no one really deals with this vile-spitting harpy is beyond my understanding. When you have watched the series, just ask yourself, what would have happened if she wasn't such a complete and utter bitch or had died years ago in a preferably painful fashion. \\n\\n\r\nNoe seems to be somewhat of an exception in this line but irritated me in her own unique ways. Though I give her credit for trying to help others instead of thinking of ways to hurt them, as everyone else seems to do. \\n\\n\r\nAnother major flaw of the show is the plot consisting mostly of soap-like twists. While other shows might sometimes need or even profit from scriptwriting like that, True Tears would have done much better with concentrating on character development I think. Shinichiro doesn't really get to know any of the girls better, as there always seems to be a farfetched plot device lurking in the shadows, waiting to distract...most of all the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nWell, all that being said, I actually rewatched the series, this time being prepared for what was to come and therefore without the need to drink myself senseless. Knowing the end and all I actually understood most of the reasoning behind the things the characters did and said, but I still wondered why they had to do it in such a cruel and self-serving manner and if such people really could harbor deeply romantic feelings in such a way. But I see at least a ray of hope for all people liking this show, generous as I am. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation and sound I almost resented them for being too good, because I got the feeling the story itself didn't deserve such embellishment, but it's certainly one reason I couldn't give up on True Tears and simply hate it without wanting to know why. \\n\\n\r\nWhy it was this series which attracted that much hatred from me, I'm unsure. It seems to be the above mentioned disappointment. At the end of the first episode I was ready to believe this was going in my top 10-list. While other series in the past turned out to surprise one way or the other, too,  True Tears was a major letdown for me. So I really can't advice to stay clear of this one, just not to expect too much. \\n\\n\r\nThis review was my first one and I'm quite refreshed after writing my grudge away. If you facepalmed yourself several times while reading please consider my native language not being English as well as my perspective being shrouded in hatred and cynicism, thank you.",

            "content": "There goes another short but awesome romance anime. True Tears.  It's a simple, yet outstanding combination of romance, drama, comedy and slice of life.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is simple at first. One guy, three girls, seems like your average gotta-catch-'em-all harem, but this one is different from the majority. It starts lighthearted, explaining the relationship between our male lead, Shin, and the three girls in his life, Hiromi, Noe and Ai. What starts as a random encounter turns to be the ignition key for a beautiful story. No Deus-Ex-Machina, no things that seem out of this world, just a simple story about love, sadness and thetears that one sheds, the true tears that one cries only when the heart is wavering. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe animation is very good. As series pass by, it seems like the animation process becomes greater and greater, resulting awesome artwork like in True Tears. The characters are very well drawn, eye-candy almost everywhere, the background scenery is awesome and the scenes that matter most are those that are drawn the best. One thing that attracted my attention was the activity of the show. The backgrounds are filled with life: students passing by and discussing, birds flying around, the waves of the sea, it all seems so real. Hats-off to the True Tears artists that worked on the project, it's really something.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening song is one of the best songs I've ever heard, in my opinion. Eufonius is a great band and the song's rhythm and lyrics can make me speed up my pace and even sing along. \\n\r\nThe background music is very good, as with all the recent anime. I love the piano and violin music they use most of the time as it fits the mood perfectly. It's without flaws yet it can always be better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the strong points of this anime. They're human. Their emotions really get to you because they're human. The girls really stand out for a harem show, especially Noe, who's like a torch in the middle of the cave, you'll forever recognize her unique character after watching it. Then there's Hiromi, the sweet and kind girl with a bit of a troubled past, nothing our male leader can't handle, and Ai, the onee-san type that's fun and out-going. \\n\r\nShin, our male leader, is quite normal. Seems cool male leaders are popular these days. Well, he's anything but cool until the moment he finally decides to set things right. He might not be the smartest bean in the jar but he's a good guy. The one small thing that I didn't like was the lack of background story for the secondary characters (like Miyokichi or Tomoyo), the rest is awesome. I really loved the characters overall. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI usually don't write a review if I don't enjoy it and this my proof. I liked this anime from the first episode and it really moved me towards the end, it was an awesome series and it was worth every minute. I'm sad it ended, since I wanted to see more but you can't help it, all good things come to an end. \\n\r\nBottom of the line is that if you're into romance shows (like I am), you'll love this one. It has it all and much more and 13 episodes was too short to satisfy my hunger. Nevertheless, I'll keep this series in my &quot;top romance anime&quot; list.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Overall Grade: 8.6, rounded up to 9",

            "content": "Written with 6 episodes watched.\r\nStory: At first, True Tears appears to be your typical guy meets girl(s), guy must pick a girl storyline, but as you continue to watch the series, several apparent underlying themes reveal themselves. Although it is somewhat similar to most romance animes, I particularly like how True Tears has all \"contenders\", if you will, continuously active through the series; instead of concentrating on 1 girl then moving on to the next through a series of different story arcs. \r\nArt: The artwork presented in True Tears is simply breathtaking. Each scene is drawn with great detail, while the characters themselves are quitesimply, a work of art. Not only are the female characters a pleasure to look at (wink), the male characters are, too, well drawn. Generally most scenes are bright and very easy on the eyes and if you have the opportunity  of watching it in hi-res format, take it! Your eyes will thank you, and you'll enjoy the experience that much more. The animation of the characters is very realistic, and thus far in the all character movements have been within human boundaries (no 10 meter high fly kicks :P). With that said, the anime is no KyoAni, but I'd personally rate it pretty close.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening theme, as with most of Eufonius' tracks, is pleasing to listen to. The music throughout the series doesn't impact on the experience much, although there are some extremely well timed moments and perfectly suited songs that make the screne *that* much more deep and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The 4 main characters in the series are all likable, even though 3 of them lack confidence in directly approaching an issue, although that's common with most romance animes. The character development is steady through the first few episodes, you get to know who they are and what they're like quite quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime, thus far, has been enjoyable. There are various humorous parts that I thoroughly enjoyed and a fair amount of moving moments which I also enjoyed. A good watch for people who are KyoAni fans, or are just generally into Romance/Drama animes.",

The characters were great, especially Noe and Miyokichi, and with Shinichirou being pretty solid for a harem lead with Hiromi not being too bad of a lead chick with terminal Yamato Nadesico syndrome, everything seemed to be set for an enjoyable ride.\r\nAnd then episode nine hit.  Neither episode nine nor episode ten were bad, per se, but they were extremely bland.  Episode nine concluded all conflict in the show up till that point.  Suddenlyand without any passion.  It was all over.  This was an incredibly bad sign.  Episode ten was just nothing.  Here, it seemed, was a great show that was going to be ended prematurely and then dragged on pointlessly until the required thirteen episodes were met.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode eleven changed all that.  It was the beginning of a quick, brutal slide into pure suckation.  The story in those last few episodes was nonsense.  The characters dropped all semblance of character and became animatrons fulfilling their plot duties.  If the random nonsense could even be termed a plot.\\n\\n\r\nMy rage for such promise to be utterly destroyed is immense.  I would highly recommend that this anime be avoided.",

            "content": "Well wasn't this a doozy!\r\nTrue Tears is the story of a young man with a talent for drawing who wants to publish a book, but the main plotline is his burning desire for his de facto \"sister,\" Yuasa Hiromi. I'm exhausted and disappointed so this won't be much more than a brief overview.\r\nI came to this from Whisper of the Heart, as I'd heard this series also involved an artistically-inclined character who's inspired to create something that truly comes from the heart. And yes, I can say Shinichiro does exactly that, but it didn't quite strike a chord with me as WotH did. Anyway, TrueTears had a really promising start, with what appeared to be a rather clich\u00e9d slice-of-life school romance story a la Toradora! or Clannad, but it seemed subversive in a way (at first). That is, the series seemed to be aware of this stereotypical treatment and took occasional jabs at itself, sort of a way to turn the clich\u00e9s on their head.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there (I would say from the second half of the eighth episode), it devolved into an ACTUALLY clich\u00e9d and heavy-handed school life story. Drama isn't a bad thing, but damn if it didn't drag the entire series down with it.\\n\\n\r\nI think there are a few principle factors that led to this sharp decline: first was that the female lead/romantic interest was completely uninteresting. I can debate the personal qualities of Yuasa Hiromi's character from sundown to sunset, and it may in the end just be a matter of opinion anyway, but ultimately I never felt like I was \"with\" her, I never felt like I could realistically root for Shinichiro to win her over. I just didn't care.\\n\\n\r\nShin himself did quite a heel face turn as well. At least in that first half, although he was oddly fixated on Hiromi, he did seem to have some sense of self-awareness and conscience. Deep down, he seemed to at least mean well to his friends and acquaintances, even the more unusual among them. Over the second half of the series, he devolves into a generic school life jerk - that is, the one all the girls want, and God knows why.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think True Tears is really a terrible series overall, and the last half may not even actually be bad. It just seems like episodes eight through thirteen could have been so much more than they were, and they ended up being a spectacular letdown. It had such a strong start and what makes it so disappointing as a series is how quickly it appeared to lose steam.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know; maybe True Tears really is a completely subversive game-changer, toying with our automatic assumption that the main character of a slice-of-life romance may make mistakes and do stupid things but at least means well. Perhaps most of the cast save two was made deliberately unlikeable for that very reason. The weird thing is that looking back, I almost feel like after around episode eight or nine, the characters are turned into people they don't seem to have been just a couple episodes prior. It's like they're jostled permanently out of their own character. Maybe I'm the only one who felt that, but feel free to come to your own conclusions. And it's a shame too, because the OP is wonderful and the art at time is breathtaking.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I think that's enough non-sequitur and passionate nonsense for one review. In a nutshell, my take on True Tears is as follows: watch it if you want, but it's neither must-see nor must-avoid. If you do decide to watch it, perhaps you'll come to a different conclusion than I did, but I frankly would've been much happier (and may even have rated the series a lot higher) if it had ended a few episodes earlier.",

            "content": "True Tears is an anime that centers on Shin\u2019ichiro Nakagami, the male lead of the story. He is friends with Hiromi Yuasa since they were children. When Hiromi\u2019s parents died, she was taken in by the Nakagami Family. With that, Shin-chan (what Shin\u2019ichiro\u2019s mother call him) struggles and at the same time develops even stronger feelings for Hiromi.\r\nHe meets Isurugi Noe in an unfateful encounter. Shin\u2019ichiro begins to get closer to Noe, and develops affection for her.\r\nStory: (6/10)\r\n\u201cThe you inside me is always crying. I wanted to wipe away your tears. But I never got to know the feeling of wiping the tears away fromyour soft cheeks.\u201d \u2013 Shin\u2019ichiro Nakagami\\n\\n\r\nThose first lines. Those sweet lines will reel you in instantly.\\n\\n\r\nIt was emotional. Most of it. The story was wonderful. It had a good beginning. And with each passing episode, you\u2019ll be wanting some more. But, unfortunately, when it got to the falling action, it made it less interesting. Truths are revealed, friendships got crushed. It was unexpectedly expected. When the Mugiha Festival came in, it will draw you in again. Then, after that, it will drive you back down. It had that intermittent up-and-down feel that will make you love and hate the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and two words: Bad Ending. Its ending was depressing. I hated it! Hate, hate, hate. I simply hated it. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, watch out for Raigomaru and Jibeta\u2019s story. It is heartwarming. It was impressive. Thumbs up on Shin-chan for that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)\\n\r\nP.A. Works. That\u2019s what encouraged me to watch True Tears. P.A. Works did an outstanding job animating Angel Beats!, so I thought that I should watch more animes produced by them. And it didn\u2019t fail me. The one thing that you will certainly love about True Tears is that its animation is perfectly done. Splashes of water, a chicken eating a sausage, a chicken flapping its wings, flowing of sweat, walking people with shadows following them, a motorcycle, basketballs, dancing with props, the sea: all of it was impressively done. Even the ending animation, where everybody was in chibi form, was very admirable. I expected nothing less from P.A. Works. Two thumbs up. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe music will carry you away. It fits the moment, and will really capture you. It really compensated the not-so-good plot of the series. Hajime Kikuchi is definitely the one to praise. \\n\\n\r\nAira Yuuki has a beautiful voice that sounds right for the ending theme. I like eufonius\u2019 opening theme, too. It was very melodious. But when I heard its instrumental, plus Hajime Kikuchi\u2019s numerous instrumentals of Reflectia (with a different title, but sounds about the same), it sounded much better. \\n\\n\r\nMy favourites would be (in order): Mujaki sa wo Senaka ni, Orange ga Ochite Iku Toki, Madobe ni mo Tareru Shoujo (Violin Ver.), Kagami, Kimi wo Utsushite, and Kokoro Kasanete. They were all very sweet and easy on the ears. Ichijin no Kaze sounds cool, too. And Aburamushi no Uta, Noe\u2019s song, is so adorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (3/10)\\n\r\nMost of them were awful. Really. The only character you\u2019d love is Noe. \\n\\n\r\nI found a photo in this link: http://i50.tinypic.com/2mfdg09.jpg. That actually sums up your description to the 5 main characters.\\n\\n\r\nShin\u2019ichiro was not very likeable. Yes, he\u2019s good-looking; Yes, he\u2019s nice. We already know male characters who are like that. And these male characters are oblivious to the feelings of the female characters around him. Sounds familiar? Yes. It does. That\u2019s why you\u2019re going to expect something different from him, something that will separate him from others. What you\u2019ll like about him though is that he is a writer in need of an inspiration. He wants to produce a story book. And as he meets Noe, he becomes motivated to continue on pursuing his dream.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters that didn\u2019t play big parts, but will make you hate them on purpose. Kanae, Aiko, Jun. They are just a few of the characters that you will dislike, no doubt about it. Noe was amazing and remarkable. She will touch your heart. She was really moving.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Shin\u2019ichiro\u2019s bestfriend, Nobuse Miyokichi, besides the fact that he was terrible at the beginning, will get you attached to him for the reason that he is going through an unrequited love. (Oh, you can relate? Lol.) \\n\\n\r\nI also wanted to see the other supporting characters a chance to get more exposure. I know they\u2019re just supporting characters, but they still deserve to be seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8/10)\\n\r\nAside from the negative parts of True Tears, you will enjoy watching it some ways you could not explain. There are funny scenes, there are heartbreaking scenes. It will surprise you that it managed to make you watch it up until the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (7/10)\\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s not as bad as it seems. All you need to give is the right appreciation. It may be that True Tears is not different from any other harems that you have watched from the past, but it still manages to separate itself from others. \\n",

            "content": "We all come into a new anime with our pre-conceived notions. In the case of romance anime, we all assume we can predict what will happen. Several girls vying for the affection of a clueless protagonist and a lot of unecessary drama occurs. \"Oh, a girl who can't shed tears needs to fall in love with a guy, so she can finally cry.\" I thought the premise was interesting, but I thought that True Tears would devolve into something we've seen time and time again.  With each passing episode, my assumptions were proven false. True Tears delivered a much more mature albeit melodramatic lookat high school romance. Still, even with its faults, True Tears deserves your attention.\\n\\n\r\nStory(7/10)- The story basically starts off like every other romance anime out there. Guy likes girl, guy is too scared to let girl know how he feels. Teenage angst ensues. But where True Tears deviates from the norm is in its execution. There is almost no comedy/fanservice, it strictly focuses on the feelings of the main 3 characters, Shinchiro, Noe and Hiromi. You are really able to empathize with the girls; you will be torn about who ends up with the MC. Where the story fails is in two places. First, the metaphorical usage of \"the chicken who could not fly.\" That part was poorly handled as it was a little hard to understand at certain points. I understand that it was supposed to represent the maturation of the MC. It was unecessarily artsy, and took away from the show. If I had a word to describe it, I would say 'misplaced.' \\n\\n\r\nMy second problem is the twist near the end of the show. We have a show that already was  semi-realistic but all of that was thrown out the window when the twist comes. I am not saying what happened is impossible, I just believe it is not plausible.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10)-The art is very crisp and beautiful. The drawings are meticulously detailed, and full of vibrant colors.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack(8/10)-The soundtrack is the standard romance anime affair. Full of moody soundscapes, tracks seeping with despair. It is good but nothing on it will make you say, \"Wow.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)-The cast of this show seems much more human than that of most romance anime. Every character here strays away from the typical archetypes: Tsundere, Kuudere and genki. I would like to say Noe, is one of the best love interests I have seen in a while. She displays a sway of different emotions, jealous, sadness, happiness. She was the most human of all. The MC was still displayed some ignorance, but not on the level of most romance anime. The only problem is that not all of the side characters are evenly developed. Unlike most romance anime, the parents actually have a significant role in the story. I found that to be surprising, but also refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, True Tears is a show that deserves your attention, especially if you are a romance-drama fan. I give True Tears an 8/10.",

            "content": "\u201cThe you within me is always crying. I have always wanted to wipe away your tears, but I cannot imagine the tenderness of wiping the tears from your face.\u201d \u2013 Shinichiro Nakagami\r\nI\u2019ve actually just watched True Tears for the third time, (I have the DVDs) and my opinion on the series has varied with each viewing. The first time I saw it, I thought it was breathtaking and heartwarming. The second time, cheesy and forced. After watching it a third time, I realize that although this series is definitely not for everyone, it displays a very interesting mixture of dream and reality that you don\u2019tfind in a lot of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers around high school student Shinichiro Nakagami, an aspiring artist who lives with his mother, his father, and the love of his life, Hiromi Yuasa, (left) who hasn\u2019t shown much happiness since she came to live with Shinichiro and his family. Loving Hiromi, chasing his dream, and being pressured by his family is tearing Shinichiro apart inside. Everything changes when he meets Isurugi Noe, (center) a very odd girl who claims that she has \u201cgiven her tears away.\u201d She tells Shinichiro that she must collect someone else\u2019s tears in order to be able to cry again, and he is, unfortunately, the prime candidate.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the entire storyline is a ton of metaphors thrown together. This is not necessarily a bad thing, nor is it a good thing. If anything, this series adds originality to every clich\u00e9 you would expect from a romantic harem drama. There are certain things that go unexplained, and certain things that seem to be tossed into the story in hopes of intensifying the mood. But overall, the way it was presented worked very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, especially the scenery, was probably the best part of this entire series. It was wonderfully animated, and most of the facial expressions of the characters were quite realistic for an animated series. I can vividly remember almost all of the background art in this anime. The scenery was so detailed and well-drawn that it\u2019s kind of hard to forget. The only problem I had as far as the art and animation was the excessive use of certain elements. There was a lot of fan service, (mostly from Hiromi) as well as an overuse of colored pencil freeze-frames and extreme close ups on people\u2019s lips. Sometimes it worked, but most of the time it was just kind of distracting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the series were very unrealistic, but in a way that makes you love every one of them. These are the kinds of people you only wish existed in real life, in that their emotions are more powerful than most people\u2019s, and these emotions are outwardly expressed through their actions. Sometimes, however, the characters personalities did seem a bit forced. It often seemed like the writers were trying too hard to make us feel sympathy for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe most well-done character by far was Isurugi Noe. Noe has a very childlike, free-spirited personality that\u2019s pretty much irresistible. Not only is she a very likeable character, but she is probably one of the only characters, other than the protagonist, that we actually get to watch grow from the beginning of the series to the end.\\n\\n\r\nI think you have to be a certain type of person to really enjoy this series. The main flaw in this series overall is that it was very, very cheesy. Therefore, in order to enjoy this series, you must be able to overcome the cheese. You have to be the kind of person who can relate to the characters, understand the metaphors, and apply the messages the anime portrays to your own life. If you\u2019re not the kind of person who connects to the shows you watch, this series is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nTrue Tears is definitely something special. It\u2019s a very lovely drama about struggles that a lot of teenagers have to face. This series can either be viewed as a powerful love story, or a melodramatic high school series. If you look past the all its flaws, True Tears can be viewed as one of the most unique dramatic harems to date.\\n",

Just save yourself from a joke of an anime. This is the single trashiest anime I have ever watched and with good reason. What does this anime do well? The story? Absolute crap. The art? The 3D animation is funky and the art is whatever. The characters? Hell no. The only thing I somewhat enjoyed from this anime was the OP and eventual OSTs that popped up here and there throughout the series. I HATEDTHIS SERIES and you will too. \\n\\n\r\nOk let me be clear. The direction that the show wanted to follow regarding a girl and her trying to find her tears back was actually not bad. It makes up for somewhat a solid foundation for a romance story but wow. What a dumpster fire. Literally a dumpster fire. The execution and direction of this show was absolute crap. Literally the main girl rarely shows up and when she does, she's either\\n\r\n 1) Getting dumped by the MC \\n\r\n2) Getting roasted by Hiromi \\n\r\n3)Talking to her chickens\\n\r\nI think the storyboarder literally forgot who the main girl was and added a bunch of unnecessary crap. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are absolutely dreadful. They don't contain any special qualities nor are they executed well. The Main MC? He's a dumb dense wishy washy character who literally just likes Hiromi because she has big tits or something. I don't know what is going on with this guy's head. He has girls all over him and he doesn't even acknowledge their feelings and just ignores them. He think he's all righteous and cool even though he plays with the girl's hearts. Such a dumb MC. \\n\r\nHiromi? Oh man, don't get me started with her. She's actually the dumbest, most controlling character I have ever seen. Like bruh, the main MC ain't your play toy and what gives you the right to tell Noe to back off? You pushed off the MC in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nNoe is okay. She's strange a bit autistic at times but I feel like if someone had gone through what she gone through, they would be a little not quite right in the head. Man overall, I just can't get over the fact how trashy this anime is. Absolutely horrible execution and just poor characters. I have no clue why these MAL users are rating this trash so highly. It's such garbage and I hope this review gets on the front page so that people don't watch this horrendous clown fest. I had more fun studying than watch this crap. Trash trash trash 2/10(2 is because I feel a little nice today)",

The character Isurugi, Noe was really interesting and to be honest the only reason i kept watching the show, she was really one of the only things that made thisshow unique. Her involvement with the male lead Nakagami, Shinichiro was almost heart breaking at times, which is a credit to the writing. My issues with the show is that well there really wasn't enough of those super interesting moments that made me really care about the characters and i found myself sorta bored at times, So much so that i found myself more interested in how some of the supporting characters were doing. As for the ending without any spoilers, it just didn't cut it for me anyway, it was all to neat for lack of a better term. So would i suggest watching it, if your into Drama/Romance you not going to go horribly wrong with anime just don't expect it to eat your heart out, if your not into Drama/Romance avoid it, you will find yourself bored and uninterested pretty fast and with the slow moving plot i wouldn't expect to enjoy it\\n\r\nHope my review was helpful\\n\r\nMurphy      \\n",

            "content": "___________________________________________ Review the 3rd\r\nChihuahua Review(short&sweet): A dramatic, HIGH quality romance with an unexpected ending(maybe just me) that keeps on making me think of \"what if's\". \r\n------------------------------>In Depth Review:<------------------------\r\nSTORY: This romance is based around the main guy, Shinichiro witih the usual three girls fighting for his love. Wrong, one of them obviously has no chance. The the other two duke it out till the very end, which some say was not the prefered finish. However the rest of the story was pretty well done with an ordinary basis flourishing with great execution and \"flying\" and tears as the main theme here. In my opinion this isAir TV made the right way. Just watch both and compare.^_^\\n\\n\r\nART: Artsyle and Animation in this was amazing. The female cast was beautiful and one especially was incredibly moe.&gt;_&lt; There was a tad bit of fanservice(1-2scenes) but nothing so much that it becomes a nuisance. The CG(computer graphics) was used well and really blended in with the amazing background. The only complaint i have that prevented the art from being a ten was the blandness of the males in comparison to the girls. Also that other than Jun the cast looked a little young for high school. The art here could rival that of KyoAni's (there i said it)\\n\r\n;)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I really liked the entire opening it really set up each episode. I don't think i've skipped it during the time i watched the series. The Cockroach Song was also  pretty important even though it wasnt really a song. It worked really well in some of the dramatic scenes. Voice acting was great so i cant say much about it. The ED in this show was passable but i didn't really listen to it until after the show since i kept on wandering on to the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: There was actually a fair amount of developement among the characters considering it was such a short series. However despite a plethora of wavering hearts and incestual obstacles the show was able to finish smoothly. With this said the characters may or may not be so likeable except maybe for ONE. :) Really interesting how they used both a childhood friend and philosophical moe girl in one series. Tough Matchup XD.\\n\\n\r\nENJOIMENT: I enjoyed this thoroughly even with my slight dissatisfaction at the end. Right now it seems to be an underrated show but it is definately worth a watch. One of the few shows that made me shed actually shed a tear. If you enjoi romance then dont consider this just watch it. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Debatable ending(debate with me if u want XD) but great everything else. No reason to hate and even with its short span it feels longer than 13episodes.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: If you like romance harems or romances in general watch this. If you liked this then watch any of KyoAni's anime or ef-a tale of memories.\\n\\n\r\nIf you dissagreed OR agreed fully with me on anything feel free to message me and discuss it. Always fun. @_@\\n\\n\r\nWoofWoof",

            "content": "The main problem with True tears is that nothing really happens at all. Most of the drama either comes from literally retarded decisions that the characters take, or plot devices (the main guy's mum).\r\nThe story starts with an internal monologue that doesn't really mean anything and is not something anyone would think, which already sets the tone for the rest of the show. We see who main guy likes, main guy also meets new girl (Noe) and they talk about flying and a chicken who no one cares about so the whole scene is boring.-----Spoilers ahead-----\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe chicken later dies and main guy is meant to replace him in order to give his tears to Noe. It was already irritating to me how seriously the main character took this \"giving tears to someone\" crap, but then Noe decided it was a good idea to annoy main guy by giving him chicken seeds and embarrassing him by waving at him and following him around. This makes main guy justifiably angry at Noe and he confronts her about it. However Noe hurts herself jumping down a tree,so she uses main guy by making him carry her when she is fine and then for some reason Noe annoying main guy is forgotten. Then main guy stumbles upon his love interest saying she likes Noe's brother (a lie, duh).\\n\\n\r\nI think a bit after that, Noe's siscon brother tells main guy that he will do whatever he wants in exchange for him dating Noe. This leads to the most fucking retarded decision done in the entire series, which was comedy gold to me: The main guy tells the brother to date his love interest in exchange for him dating Noe, whom he doesn't like at the present. He is even shown to be mad at them dating.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that main guy's love interest tells him that they're brothers because of an affair his dad had. This turns out to be a lie that main guy's mum (who acts like a bitch for most of the show) made up because reasons. Later on, when main guy momentarily gains a neuron he asks his dad who says its a lie and then the mum randomly turns into a better person because who cares anyway.\\n\\n\r\nNoe and main guy started dating after main guy thought he was his love interest's brother, however when thats cleared up he starts dating his initial love interest, who now lives alone (which is kinda cool tbh).\\n\\n\r\nStuff happens and we reach the main guy's relationships climax, which is actually a good scene, where he cries while telling Noe that he doesn't love her (he cries because Noe actually impacted his life in a good way in the end, more than the other love interest did). \\n\\n\r\nOne of the few parts of the show that could've had promise was the relationship of main guy and the 2 dating people. However, of course, the girl actually likes main guy. This raises the question of why she even accepted dating the other guy-it turns out that the 2 guys asked very nicely and since the girl is retarded (like many other characters in this show) she accepted. This is one of the instances of drama being created (between the 2 guys and girl) due to a retarded decision.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully at the end the other 2 decide to give dating another try or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and opening song are good, however they don't compensate for the plethora of boring or not-funny dumb scenes. If you haven't already, don't watch this show.\\n",

            "content": "&ldquo;True Tears&rdquo; managed to grab from the first episode on due to its more serious themes and the different situations the characters find themselves in, which are not as shallow or simple as they sometimes can be. Especially the Nakagami family situation, and those some of the other characters are in lean closer to more plausible life situations and help make those characters less two dimensional. Not all is black and white, but more grey. \r\nThis continues throughout the series for several of the plots and characters involved, especially Hiromi and Aiko are slightly more complex and realistic characters.\r\nBeing more of a romance/harem series orromantic drama, it does not forego the classic theme of all (or most) of the female characters having feelings for the male leading character. Although from the very first episode there's strong hints that &ldquo;True Tears&rdquo; has a 'fated' pairing, one which seems to be the only possible outcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe main theme surrounding Neo who 'gave away her tears' is offfered as the central thread throughout the series but is little more than a gimmick for the series to differentiate itself from similar titles and serves as metaphor for the characters to express their feelings and emotional quests.\\n\r\nFar more interesting is the theme involving the chicken that Neo adores, and the ability to fly. This translates into the picture book Shinichiro strives to create. A metaphor for him being able to move forward and break away from the emotional burdens he has by growing past them. The same goes for the other characters, Hiromi, Neo, Aiko and Miyokichi.\\n\r\nIn that aspect, &ldquo;True Tears&rdquo; mainly deals with growth, adulthood and change. Being able to grow past emotionally stressful circumstances, from verbal abuse and emotional rejection at home, to unrequited love, social isolation at school,...\\n\r\nA theme that plenty of series touch upon, but is done so fairly well here because it touches some more realistic situations, which also makes them a bit more melodramatic at times and as such both brings with it a positive note as well as a negative one.\\n\\n\r\nNeo who's most often displayed as the token weird girl character, is the one who spurs most others to grow and change, to break free from the situations they may seem stuck in.\\n\\n\r\nShinichiro's character evolution is a bit more classic, the young lad who is oblivious to some of the inner feelings of those around him and who seeks to stretch out and lead a life that satisfies him as he feels pushed into doing things he himself hasn't really desired. Eventually he matures and discovers that even the traditional Japanese folk dance he was forced to study and participate in, is a rewarding experience and allows him to make a new memory with Hiromi. This is seldom seen, as in most series he would just become a rebellious character that breaks free yet here the end result is more realistic. He does things he didn't want to do originally and comes to appreciate some and learns from others.\\n\\n\r\nHiromi was to me by far the most interesting and realistic character. While able to be more of herself at school, mostly thanks to playing at the basketball club, she was forced to endure a lot of emotional stress at home. She has been living in Shinichiro's family after her parents passed away but was often verbally abused or reprimanded by Shinichiro's mother and had to seal away her own feelings of affection for Shinichiro that she carried since childhood. She grows past that struggle and moves out to live by herself, she overcomes those hurdles and can finally confess her feelings for Shinichiro and become closer to him. Along the way her character had some of the most realistic evolution and scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEven though Aiko has a crush on Shinichiro, which puts stress on her relationship with Miyokichi , the boy she subsequently breaks up with, realizing her feelings are unrequited she grows past it and eventually starts over with Miyokichi. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is solid throughout most episodes with particular attention to subtle facial expressions which greatly help give it a more realistic atmosphere. Most characters have realistic hairstyles and colors while still remaining recognizable.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is decent, with a cute opening song. It does not particularly excel but accentuates scenes and moods where needed.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you like romantic series and can appreciate them being just a bit more serious and realistic without becoming heavy, then I recommend &ldquo;True Tears&rdquo;.",

            "content": "\u201cMomentarily tears has been flowing away\u201c\r\n# Story \u2013 8 #\r\nThe center of attraction here is about deep romance and drama between characters that gives realistic thoughts. It\u2019s about indecisive emotions and thoughts of characters that have been kept inside for quite some time, and with each passing day thinking to realize that it\u2019s just too late or the perfect time to say it. \r\nThe story has a nice arc in a school life with limited characters to focus on to the main plot. A love triangle between a boy and three girls forms a quite harem, and then it developed to a true love. Hisconspicuous kindness towards them brings an emotional condition, which causes an indirect stress and tension, that\u2019s not quite new. Though he didn\u2019t notice it, he continues to strive slowly and took whatever he dreamt of without thinking the circumstances behind it. As you can see, this is all about dramatic and romantic emotions of specific characters. From simple story, little by little it became more complicated and at the end you will just notice that those scenes are moving you. A nice story to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nInvolvement of other characters to the arc such as, friends, families, and admirer are effective throughout the series. It helps to make the arc more complicated and dramatic but it\u2019s not helpful enough to keep my senses from being satisfied though it lacks on something. It\u2019s a progressive story that is on track and contains simple yet affecting situations. The degree of story starts from a low impression, and then it dramatically increases on every episode. \\n\\n\r\nThough it only composed with 13 episodes, it contains no filler at the end, no long monologues, nice puzzling story, and a wonderful arc. It\u2019s just the right length of such anime because they didn\u2019t make an additional plot they just focus on one single arc. Though you may find it as a very simple story, kind of unpredictable events and has a wonderful arc and in the end you may find it as a well-created touching series.\\n\\n\r\n# Art & Animation \u2013 9 #\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful, the scenery and the background are suited well to most scenes in the story. As expected to a romance and drama series, highlight of the surroundings gives more emotions and feelings to the characters and to the story. The animation is good, facial expressions, body movements and expression of feelings and thoughts are in its modest appearance. There\u2019s nothing bad about the art and animation effects.\\n\\n\r\n# Sounds \u2013 9 #\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED have a harmonic sound and a catchy tune pertaining to the story itself. Soft and calm voices, happy and sad BG music helped a lot to emphasize romance and drama.\\n\\n\r\n# Characters \u2013 8 #\\n\\n\r\nEach character has a distinctive role that shows the true meaning of the story. A role of being loved and to love others, it\u2019s a set of characters with different perception and belief in life that\u2019s bound to meet each other then starts to revolve among them. As a drama series they put a softhearted and hardhearted to be able to make a contrast of feelings that surely influence you when watching. The character development is growing and getting deeper on each episode, a good indication that it\u2019s done well as a whole. Nothing to say much about it though it really comes handy throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\n# Enjoyment \u2013 8 #\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment depends on the taste of viewers, even though it has great story, art & animation, sounds, and characters, it may lack on something that some of us willing to watch, and that\u2019s comedy, it causes some discontentment but still you can enjoy it in a dramatic way without regrets.\\n\\n\r\n# Overall \u2013 8 #\\n\\n\r\nBy some exceptions the rating would be 8, for me it\u2019s just a romance and drama, nothing amazing in specific, but the good part is that it\u2019s a unique, great, and well-designed anime, not to be missed even though there\u2019s some quite competitive anime. It\u2019s a dramatic story that reflects.",

If you like Clannad or the whole harem slice of life scene - YOU MUST WATCH THIS.\r\nStory\r\nOk starting off it's everything perfect and it's not long before you realise what's actually going on. The story was well written and the structure was pretty good also. I was impressed by the way this anime turned out, it was a little more detailed than I first thought it would be. The story has a bunch of suprises and kept me wanting to watchthe next episode constantly to find out what would happen next. Very enjoyable, 9!\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art work that went into this was nothing special I don't think you should watch this just because of the animation. Although I thought it was well drawn and very nice to look it, it was still nothing special, but because i enjoyed it I give it a nice fair 7 =]\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nWell it was partially the OP that got me hooked on wanting to watch this so I think it would be hypocritical for me to say the sound was bad. Although getting into the anime my opinion remained the same and I will try and get the OST after i finish writing this. Engouh said.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nOMG The characters in True Tears has a whole lot of depth and more. There was 4 Characters in particular that I feel as if I know well, 3 of which had decriptive pasts which were potrayed through out True Tears.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWahahaha All I can think of say here at the minute is that Im watching it again several times as i force my friends to watch it haha\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIf you like either school girl anime, harem, slice of life or romance. WATCH THIS NOW, OR YOUR MISSING OUT BIIIIIIG!!!",

            "content": "Not a bad storyline on this anime - it's like \"warped love triangle meets weird voodoo rituals\" which makes it interesting. There's messages within messages and sometimes I found myself over thinking what was trying to be said and was left confused - the chicken. The chicken had my mind... blown. \r\nStory: As mentioned, it was quite interesting. It began to get shoujo feels but right when you go to predict something it takes a sharp 180 and you go down another path. The chicken backstory or philisophy (?) was verrryy6 interesting and borderline weird but in a good way. You take what you canout of that yourself - it has a million different interpretations. The romance builds quite quickly and there is a whooolleee lot of sympathetic feels getting thrown around this entire anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Not your average characters. The MC is bland but builds along with the anime. The two main girls and love interests start off interesting and then tip-toe on the border of complex and predictable. Side characters - Jun, Nobuse and Nobuse's girlfriend (?) a.k.a love interest no. 3 for Shinichiro - all remain sideline but when their 2 cents is put in, boy, can it cause an explosion (not a bad thing at all) they add spice to the anime - not your typical sideliners. And whats an anime without some incest? Juns love for his sister would have been an interesting side story but they developed, expanded and resolved it within I believe 2 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Is splendid as expected for the era. Nothing was necessarily needed for an absolutely outstanding  art display but it sufficed for what was given. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: Didnt pay too much attention to it. Didnt have the patience for the OP & ED. The cockroach song is catchy. Very catchy. Like. Very. Catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Give it a solid go. The beginning starts off as a typical \"female living in males house and they become closer\" but you just wait - it expands in all sorts areas. There is family development - past present and future. For a short anime it expands quite thoroughly on all its issues. If I had to side with one problem it would be the build up on the OTP. I'll leave you with that.",

Well written stories, no matter how long ago they were written, are always enjoyable during any era. True Tears is definitely one of those kind of stories. While it is not particularly unique, the way it handles the romance is absolutely fantastic. \r\nThe story to True Tears chronicles Shinichiro, a high school student, as he discovers his romantic desires. His romantic interests are: Hiromi, an athletic and beautiful girl who lives with his family after her own family experiences turmoil, Noe, an eccentric girl who gives names to theschool chickens, sings about cockroaches under Shinichiro's feet, and most importantly (to the story at least), wishes to collect \"true tears,\" and finally Aiko, a childhood friend who is, with a lack of a better term, a good friend. Of course, any romance story in anime cannot be devoid of a male sidekick. For Shinichiro, he is paired with his good friend Miyokichi who happens to be in a relationship with Aiko (do you sense drama??). \\n\\n\r\nAfter the introduction of all the characters, the story of True Tears takes off. The story is mainly developed through Shinichiro's picture book that he is writing. That is, as he changes his relationship with each girl, the characters in his picture book change with him as well. Each episode, especially towards the end, ends on so many cliffhangers that my eyes were glued to the screen. I was constantly asking myself, \"What is going to happen next?\" For me, that is a sign of a good anime. Another good aspect of this anime was the symbolism. Indeed, the writers may have overdone it but I enjoyed guessing at what those images represent or what the characters are trying to refer to. It opens the door to many interpretations and it gets exciting to see if your thinking was actually right in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, a romance and drama anime cannot skip a discussion about the romance. True Tears is a heartwarming (and occasionally tragic) tale of understanding your own feelings. Each character sets out on their individual \"feelings\" journey as they grapple with what they seek in a relationship. The feelings were very genuine and it tugged at my heartstrings, though not to the extent that I had to pull out my tissue box.  Without spoiling too much, by the end, I was happy if Shinichiro ended up with any of the main female characters. I tip my hat to True Tears' well done romance.\\n\\n\r\nTrue Tears' cast was very good. Although I thought some characters were underdeveloped, the writers nevertheless pushed the right buttons and gave us a set of enjoyable and realistic characters. At first, Hiromi is relatively cold towards Shinichiro but as she warms up to him we discover her backstory and realize there was a reason behind her cold heart. She is absolutely not a tsundere. Noe is just plain loveable. From her cute Shinichiro song to her deep inner feelings, it's hard not to like Noe. Further, her instant chemistry with our main character makes us fall for her even more. On the contrary, Aiko is the least developed out of the three main girls. Since she has minimal backstory, her desires seem to be unsupported, making her scenes feel like \"forced\" drama. But overall, it's not hard to like all three of our main girls.\\n\\n\r\nI am not an expert in the animation of 2008 but I thought the visuals were well done. The best animation sequence is probably when they show an overhead of the characters walking and we see their graceful walking postures. Further, the artists captured the details of each character's emotions really well. I would describe the colour palette as more melancholic. The brightest colours were reserved for scenes in Shinichiro's picture book. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP was fantastic. Guided by Eufonius' smooth voice (same artist who did Clannad's opening), the OP introduces us, in a carousel fashion (my personal favourite technique), to the main female characters as they stand in the leaves of an autumn forest. The first 20 seconds of the OP was enough to get me to watch 13 episodes of True Tears. Now that is a great opening. On the other hand, the OST was not particularly outstanding but not terrible either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, True Tears is a very enjoyable anime. We get to travel with the characters as they open themselves up to us and to each other. It's a heartfelt tale of seeking a good relationship. If you are a fan of romantic anime and haven't yet watched True Tears, it should definitely go onto your \"Watching\" list soon. If you prefer your romance with some comedy, then True Tears may not be suited for you. If you are simply seeking a good story, give True Tears a shot!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! Let me know how you thought of the anime! Did Shinichiro choose the right person? I would love to know!",

            "content": "Every once and a while, you run into an anime that you find at random and completely knocks you off your feet and leaves you with nothing but good impressions. True Tears was one of these animes that left such an impact on me making it worth mentioning at the beginning of my review.\r\nI'd like to begin by saying that the genre of True Tears is mostly drama and romance. True Tears should barely be considered a harem and if what your looking for is a bunch of girls on one guy, forget it. Another thing I would like to add is to also disregardthe synopsis because I believe they are usually a bit misleading and can easily sway you into either watching it expecting different things, or dropping it knowing you won't find what you want even though it may very well be there.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you should take from the synopsis if you have read it however, is that Nakagami Shinichiro lives in the same household as his classmate/childhood friend \\n\r\nYuasa Hiromi. Shinichiro also happens to have quite and artistic mind and draws a picture of her crying because deep down inside, he feels that she puts up a front that makes it seem that she is never sad. Also the encounter of a strange girl named Isurugi Noe would spark the beginning of all the development in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story goes, it is a serious drama with perfectly paced character and story development. Without developing too slowly or rather too quickly since True Tears is only 13 episodes, the story is EXTREMELY easy to grasp and understand as well as quickly pulling us in and keeping us in our seats. The story itself holds quite a bit of realism because each and all the characters in the story do not seem completely far-fetched and no particular character seems to be the \"theres no way someone can be like that\".\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, True Tears is not going to be your generic drama romances where theres going to be some super ultra climax and clash between rivals, and the outcome becomes some ridiculously tragic tale with either 1 couple immensely in love with each other, or no one being happy at all. There is gonna be a reasonable conclusion, one that won't set the epilogue(if there was one) in stone and could very much easily be changed over a short period of time. But as any great anime would, it will leave you thinking of what could happen if the story were to continue(and from there you can fulfill your deepest fantasies for how you wanted it to end). No matter how you put it, if you enjoyed it as much as I have, True tears \\n\\n\r\nAs for how True Tears was broken down, rather then True Tears being episodic, be prepared to keep on watching because most times it will leave you with cliffhangers as high as skyscrapers and if you, like me, had to stop because of something u had to do (in my case sleep), it would leave u twitching with excitement and anticipation much like waiting for the next chapter of a manga you love but only having it come once a month.\\n\\n\r\nHaving to find such a masterpiece wasnt enough, the fact that it had such a great OP and soundtrack sent it to a whole new level. Kudos to Eufonius for yet another great OP furthermore deepening my love for their music.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it wasn't hard to realize that I myself would be so absorbed into True Tears and find myself reviewing it with nothing but good things to say and with nothing to possibly complain about, True Tears EARNS my 10.",

            "content": "I haven't felt so much rage and disappointment for a long time, since finding out that my girlfriend was actually a guy. Just kidding, but that's exactly what I felt after watching True Tears.\u00a0\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is relatively simple, about 3 girls and their relationships with this one guy. Yes, it's a harem, but it's a romantic harem that is done correctly. No ecchi situations, no guy failing over girl and touching her boobs, no sudden banging into girl showering, (save maybe for one scene...) just pure dialogues and feelings that are well delivered to the audiences. The romance aspect is handled quite well andit's sweet and enjoyable most of the times. The characters are another story though.. The pace of the story is rather slow at the beginning, and it might turn some viewers off. However its redeeming quality is that it makes you want for more. After watching the first episode, I was captured by the morbid suspense. Like, how will the turtle paced story work out? Will it end like School Days? Who will shinichi kun choose? And most importantly, how are babies formed? (Very morbid, don't ask) The plot worked out after a few episodes but broke down near the end. Personally I dislike the end. However, I appreciate that the story is realistic. I can really feel the angst and confusion felt by the teenage characters throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nConsistent art. Though the use of 3D imaging for some backgrounds looks somewhat unrealistic and weird on screen, but I give credits for the animators for trying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nRight, the characters. They. Are. Detestable. Shinichi is indecisive, dense, insensitive asshole sometimes. Yet I felt that he's the embodiment of teenage boys. Most of the times, I can understand his feelings and actions because I'm a teenager myself. I would probably be as stuck up as he was if I were in his shoes. It gives a sense of realism to the show. The 3 girls involved are angsty and painful to watch, especially Hiromi. She's like the female version of Shinichi. Only with 2x the angst. Noe is the only one is spared from my rage, since she's more or less a victim of romance. The other girl whom I can't remember the name was such a minor character you would think nothing would have changed if she was taken out. In such a sense, I should give a low score in this section right? Well, I felt that it's better for viewers to feel depressed rather than feel nothing at all. Consider a story like this..,. A sexy angel fell from the sky and starts obeying the whims of a perverted high school plain ass john. And then more angels start falling from the sky, just to include the harem factor.\u00a0Not to mention they all look the same except for their hairstyle. The whole plot is driven by ecchi situations, with little to none developments to the characters. I mean, what can one feel about such an anime where the characters have no personality? Any emotions felt for such trash will be sorely missed by your body, because they are wasted. Sorry I digress. The characters in true tears are detestable, BUT, they have a soul. They have personality, no matter how much I dislike, I still like them for who they are, because they are REAL! I still can't get why those 3 girls are attracted to such a douche protagonist though. \\n\\n\r\nOh yes, special mention to shinichi's mum, you're a bitch.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyable, and well-placed. Nothing too special to be mentioned.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nMehhhh I could have enjoyed more if the series was longer, and with a better ending. However it's still somewhat enjoyable considering I have nothing else to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nNot bad, could be better. Good development, stupid but real characters, subpar storyline, slow but mysterious start, bad ending, overall somehow makes a good anime. Thanks for reading my review. Pardon my English.",

            "content": "THE FOLLOWING REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nBefore embarking on this journey, I wish to clarify one thing: I utterly despise this series. Very few pieces of art have caused me greater misery and anger than True Tears. I do not consider myself qualified to give professional critique on an artwork like this (or any anime, for that matter), hence the ratings I give to various animes and mangas are based upon my personal enjoyment and emotions. As a result of this, I was able to give this series a 10 despite my hatred and annoyance. \r\nSTORY: The setting of True Tears is a pretty generic High School.The story revolves around an 'average' boy Shinichirou who is in love with his classmate and childhood friend Hiromi, who just so happens to live with him after losing her parents. The other main characters include Ai, Shinichirou's childhood friend (who has a crush on him) and Noe (who eventually falls for him). Seems like a pretty clich\u00e9d harem setting so far. However, this anime is nearly 10 years old and since I wasn't much into anime back then, I have no idea what the general trend of that time was. For this reason, I can give it some slack here. Hiromi is popular, Ms Perfect at school but is cold and distant at home, mostly due to the way she is treated by Shin's mother. Hence, Shin is unable to do anything about his feelings for her. Enter Noe. a cheerful, chicken-loving (not for their taste), happy-go-lucky girl (not exactly, as we find out later) who given Shinichirou impetus in various forms to face his challenges and overcome them. As the story continues, Shinichirou is forced to face and resolve the love triangle that forms around him. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nNOE: Noe is a significant reason that I gave this anime a 10. To be very honest, without Noe, I wouldn't even have bothered to write this review. It's pretty clear by now that I'm heavily biased towards her but allow me to explain. We are introduced properly to Noe when she opens up to Shin and tells him that she can't cry because she 'gave away her tears'. Not only I have a keen interest in psychology, but I can also personally relate to Noe. Just like her, I have trouble crying. But unlike her, I did not suffer from any major traumatic events. Noe is an introverted girl who has very little grasp over social norms and her own emotions. She tends to oversimplify things and trusts, to the extent which ends up hurting her, everyone she remotely cares about. Although she is aware of her grandmother's death, she has been unable to process it emotionally. Ever since that event, her mind has created psychological barriers which block pain to protect her. Although, she seems to be aware of this fact and searches for a 'dear one' who will be able to give her tears. Given these little clues, she probably has a case of Asperger's Syndrome. It;s a long stretch but not improbable. Noe projects herself and Shin on chickens kept in their school's pen. The analogy to chicken is an important point in the story as it provides much of the basis for character development of both Noe and Shinichirou (as he is the one who writes a picture book based on both chicken and. as we later find out, does it only for Noe). Noe had two important male characters in her life, her elder brother, Jun, and Shinichirou. In what is possibly one of the most tragic developments I have ever seen. both these characters betray her love and trust. Jun, because of his sinful feelings and Shin because the plot requires him to (more on this later). She realizes while trying to make one of the chicken fly, that she can only cry when she chooses to. She realizes that in her quest to find her tears, she has been blind to feelings of others (although she is not to be entirely blamed for this given how others simply used her for their own satisfaction). This scene was quite impressive and one of the best scenes portraying significant character development amongst all animes I've seen in this genre. However, this series has been unfairly sadistic towards Noe. Her innocence and cuteness seem to have been made simply to provide juxtaposition to the events which befall her. Instead of falling into the usual tragic heroine trope, Noe seems to have been developed with the sole purpose of being a sadist's punch doll. I am not sure what the creator was trying to achieve with Noe, but I must express my immense displeasure at Noe's treatment. I did not necessarily want her ending up with Shin, but given the fact that everyone else conveniently ends up in a 'Happily Forever After', is it too much to expect an ending where Noe is able to sort out her relation with others? No, giving her 'friends' out of the blue in the epilogue does not count as a good ending. All in all, I believe that Noe was made to be a lovable character in tragedy meant to evoke sympathy from audience. Congratulations! You got me and I hate you for that. \\n\\n\r\nSHINICHIROU: Ah, the good old MC who seems average but ends up in a harem setting being alternately dense and perceptive as per the convenience of the plot. Was there ever a time when MC's weren't like this? Since this problem isn't exactly specific to this series, I am not gonna rant a lot about it. Shinichirou was too dense to realize Ai's crush for him but handles it quite well when she did kiss him. Ok, so far so good. His indecisiveness serves as a major foundation for conflicts and is necessary, to an extent, to further the plot. Initially, his character development was quite interesting. He liked Hiromi but she kept her distance. When he overhears her saying that she likes Jun, he finally decides to give up on her. Enter Jun, who wants him to date Noe. Shinichirou is initially against the idea but agrees to do it if Jun dated Hiromi in exchange. Although this might appear to be 'not so uncommon' situation, in my opinion, this is a blatant inconsistency in the character we've been introduced to so far. Such an exchange would require a fairly manipulative and calculating personality. This is where things start going downhill.  Since Jun keeps his end of the deal and Shin believes that Hiromi does actually like Jun, he confesses to Noe. In spite of the half hearted motivation behind this 'confession', he realizes that Noe actually likes him. He even indulges her wish to write the confession using stones and seems to realize that even he might actually like her romantically. This is where I gave him a second chance. Obviously, I knew that things wouldn't go smoothly, but I expected a lot more than what was actually served to us. The relationship actually goes really well, until Hiromi and Shin are told that they're not siblings (a misunderstanding caused by suspicions of Shin's mother). This obviously opened up a previously closed door to their relationship. However, given the fact that Shin had (attempted to) given up on Hiromi and entered into a relationship with Noe, I expected him to be more conflicted about it. But what did we get? Shinichirou ignoring Noe and mooning over Hiromi. Despite having a better understanding of Noe at this point, he doesn't confront her in any way. This sudden reversal of emotions negates all the development that happened up until this point. In the final few episodes, we see his conflict in the form of him being unable to draw. The only reason he is able to do it is when he thinks about Noe. Great, now he should resolve this in a mature manner and tel......Nope. He still loves Hiromi. Why? Because screw common sense, that's why. I agree that love is not always based on logic or common sense, but this is a story. And if all the clues and foreshadowing in your story point towards X, but you end abruptly with Y, it feels like an attempt to undermine the audience in a highly immature way. \\n\\n\r\nHIROMI: This little piglet built a house of bricks, and never came out. Despite all my bias towards Noe and Shin\u2019s indecisiveness, I would have been ok with the ending had Hiromi gotten a better character development. Or rather, if she had gotten ANY character development at all. The only backstory we have on her is the festival incident. For all the screen time devoted to other relationships and characters, we\u2019re somehow supposed to be ok with this one being the \u2018one true love\u2019 of MC. Right till the end, she stays a selfish, self pitying and overall unremarkable character who is no better than Jun, the person she belittled for only caring about his own self. Just like in the series, there\u2019s not much to say about her. She\u2019s just the love interest of MC and we\u2019re meant to accept that at face value. No strings attached.\\n\\n\r\nJUN: A despicable character, to say the least. His self centred personality doesn\u2019t show initially due to his sister complex. To be honest, even after Hiromi accused him of being one, I did not expect it to be as bad as it turned out to be. He was quite literally the only male role model in her life and he knew about her rather gullible personality. Despite that, he continued to indulge in his sinful feelings. However, he did realize the social consequences and hence tried to have her date Shinichirou in a twisted attempt to control her emotions. The scene where he \u2018confronts\u2019 Noe was one of the very few scenes which have filled me with pure rage. In a somewhat controversial (for me) move, he decides to move away from Noe. He single handedly robbed his little sister of love, trust and guidance of an elder male figure (and yet this guy gets more character development than Hiromi).\\n\\n\r\nART: I do not have any technical knowledge about art (notice the oxymoron :p), but I rather liked the palette used in this series. The scenic beauty, especially the sea and the snow is commendable.\\n\\n\r\nOST: The BGM is an incredibly effective tool which is often neglected or not used to its full potential. Fortunately, that mistake is not made here. There are a couple of tunes which immediately catch attention whereas others set exactly the right mood to engross the audience in the scene and amplify its impact. The OP/ED are not particularly extraordinary but do their job decently. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the combination of right music, animation and dialogue was extremely engrossing and kept me watching continuously. Although, due to its shortcomings as far as the plot and it\u2019s way of dealing with characters is concerned, I can never bring myself to like it. It may be that this genre isn\u2019t meant for me for nothing gives me more pain than watching badly executed love triangles (though, to be fair, a love triangle can rarely end well). Still, I give this series a 10 for its excellent direction and character development of Noe which allowed me to feel, the reason I watch anime in the first place. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for not only romance but in depth deconstruction of character psyches and their development.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes we get shows where there are particular parts that we don't enjoy as much as the rest of the series, sometimes shows start off badly and come together later on, and sometimes shows have a train crash towards the end. It is because of these facts about many anime shows out there that I have grown to appreciate anime that have consistency. I want to be able to enjoy a show from start to finish and feel like there are no real episodes wasted. This is where True Tears shines. Every episode felt like there was something significant to watch in it, every episodewas enjoyable, every episode was used to the best of its ability. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe the story of True Tears, the first thing I would say is that it is a love triangle story. And while that may sound unattractive to some considering how many indecisive harem leads anime has subjected us to in the past, this show quickly distances itself with its characterization and overall quality of storytelling and direction. The main lead Shinchiro initially starts out the show interested in a girl Hiromi, who for various reasons lives with his family. Shinchiro, a seemingly talented artist, is frustrated with his current lifestyle because he is not able to communicate to the girl he likes, and because he is forced by his parents into participating in a festival. It is at this point that we see him begin to work on a picture book. While on the surface this story is a love triangle story, underneath it is more about Shinchiro finding the will and courage to move forward with his life in positive direction, whether it be love or the responsibilities he is given in his life. This is both reflected in the world of the anime and in Shinciro\u2019s picture book, as one can see the picture book\u2019s story reflecting the inner and outer turmoil surrounding of Shinchiro. The girls, while very interesting characters in their own right, serve as the catalysts for Shnchiro\u2019s development throughout the story. Because of this and more True Tears manages to be a compelling love triangle story.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, when I decided to first go and watch this series, I was extremely skeptical due to hype tending not to meet my expectations. Much to my surprise though, I was totally drawn in. What really got me into it quickly were a few things that I noticed. One was the pacing as it doesn't rush through anything and quietly moves its plot along in realistic fashion. I must say I was quite elated to find this show. My question though was if this would continue like so? And the answer would have to be more or less, yes.\\n\\n\r\nAs I went through the series, two other things captivated me, the subtly of the actions, and the eccentric Noe. While not being the most real character in the series, this is where I believe fiction can do its work with imagination in presenting such a character.  She gave a huge sense of freshness to the show in general with her quirky behavior. Both this and the subtly of the character actions really caught my attention early on. Many anime are heavily reliant on building up to climaxes of drama that if they don\u2019t manage to hit you, can often fall flat on their face. They don\u2019t use any subtly in their craft, and really expect to just tug on people\u2019s heart strings. Where True Tears differs is that there\u2019s no desire to really build up to big climaxes. True Tears tries to express a drama in realistic terms, from the body language of the characters, to how they interact. The drama flows naturally and there is rarely moments of hamminess. \\n\\n\r\nI must say though, that I can\u2019t emphasize enough how much I like seeing pretty original characters in stories these days and that is why I appreciate Noe so much. If it were not for her, this series could seriously have just been another one of those romance anime that you don't really care much about if it passes by. The whole influence on the picture book that Shinchiro wrote, and the symbolism going on, was all greatly aided by her character. She added an irreplaceable amount of importance to the story that no other character I think could have done in her place. This is not to say that the other characters were bad. Hiromi is not very likable to me as well, but Noe definitely provided me something special in this series.\\n\\n\r\nIf there are any criticisms I have though is that some characters didn\u2019t get enough development, such as Shinchiro\u2019s friend Nobuse and the girl Aiko (Who technically makes this show a love square). Their presence in the show didn\u2019t feel all too needed, so I have to question why their very purpose in the sotry in the first place. Other criticism would have to be is that towards the ending the plot felt like it was directing the character\u2019s actions rather than the characters directing the plot. Because of these things, I cannot justify rating this anime any higher, but really it was still great overall.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime should be a winner on technical merits alone, but the mostly genuine feeling of its storytelling and honesty in its presentation makes this series fully worth recommending to anyone with interest in the genre.\\n",

            "content": "\"True Tears\", a meaningful name for an astounding Romance Harem show that has a very engaging and creative plot, unlike most animes of this genre that tend to opt the basic formula and end up with an open-ending most of the time.\r\nI began watching this serie with that prejudiced thought in mind, but since I am a die-hard fan of Romance and Harem in general, of course I could not afford to let such show pass under my radar, which also served as my ahoge. At first, everything is what you can find in a typical Harem show:\r\n_The male lead is already in love withhis childhood friend, Hiromi. I admit that the thick-headed protagonists are more overused these days, but this kind of lead and childhood friends falling in love is not something innovative either.\\n\\n\r\n_As usual, the main love interest is decided at the beginning of the show and of course, she was perfect in every aspects, like her predecessors Harem female leads. BUT, things will drastically change from here on, you can say  that those things are just the facade that cover the true intriguing nature of the plot, so stay tuned!\\n\\n\r\nBut other than those elements commonly found, True Tears also offers a variety of changes such as:\\n\\n\r\n_The lead, Shinichiro, is NOT the usual good-for-nothing kind of lead. In fact, he has a passion and he was good at it as an artist. A major change that was made is that the story mostly was told in his first person point of view that is rare to come across in this kind of show. \\n\\n\r\n_Another interesting fact was that his love life is somehow reflected through his work as it changes over the course of the story until he finds the meaning of the \"true tears\" that he was looking for. \\n\\n\r\n_His sidekick friend is also different compared to other leads' friends in the aspect that he had a girlfriend, and a really cute one too, so not the kind of unpopular, comic relief character that was used in Clannad or To-Love-Ru. And somehow his love life will also be  part of the story too.\\n\\n\r\n_One of the rare Harem shows where fanservice is toned down to the point of nonexistant; hence allowed the plot to progress wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\n                                                ............\\n\\n\r\nThat was to show True Tears is not your everyday Harem-Romance shows. I like the fact that Shinichiro was a decisive and reliable guy who knows what he is doing and has the guts to take action if needed to. His love potentials also have distinctive personalities that were realistic ( no spoilers about their \"realistic\" personalities for the sake of your enjoyment) as well as their non-exaggerated physical appearance that, in my honest opinion, were more pleasant to look at than other series that focused on the size of the heroines' chest rather than the plot itself.\\n\\n\r\nAnother charming point of this show is its storytelling that is centered about various kind of tears coming from the heroines that gradually answered the puzzle about tears at the beginning of the show. Major dramatic plot twists that come one after another will also ensure that the viewers won't get bored throughout the story and cream out of joy at the end for an unexpected coupling surrounded in a very original and mesmerizing background.\\n\\n\r\nThe stunningly high quality graphics ( the best of its season in my honest opinion) as well as the lovely opening and ending songs also contributed to the creation of one of the best Harem-Romance ever created. True Tears was a wonderful experience and it was so fast that before you even realize it, you are already longing for more and missing it while shedding either your Happy Tears or Sad Tears, depending on your favorite girl.",

The first anime I've seen from them was Nagi no Asukara and I quite liked it. The next one I saw was Glasslip, of which the art was still to my liking but the story was all over the place.\r\nIn this anime, the artwork wasn't as pretty as the previous ones I've seen. Perhaps because the overall tone of the story itself is rather dark.\r\nThe story itselfwas also a bit too stressful for me. Everyone seems to have an agenda except the two leads. The side characters (aside from the best friends) are manipulative and pushy, sometimes borderline psychotic, add to that a hefty dose of bitterness because of circumstances that neither MC's have brought about.  However, for anyone who is looking for a lot of dramatic tension, then this is a good anime to watch.",

We all know that harems are generally pretty silly and filled with more than a fair share of ecchi moments, but, dang, I'm totally, 100% okay with this anime deviating from the common ground.\r\nStory: 9\r\nTo me, the story is created with each passing episode and that the \"tears\" and \"sky\" symbolism don't really count as it. In my opinion, it revolves around Shin and thankfully it did. \r\nArt: 10\r\nUnlike other animes that start off with areally great showcase of animation for the first few episodes, True Tears stays consistent throughout the duration of the series. And man is it gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe soft string/horn playing into a short, singly piano note really accentuates a scenes dramatic effect. The entire track is just wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nReally, really, really great characters and development. I was awfully surprised at the ability of the creators to profoundly develop each character within a short 13 episode span. The only thing keeping this from a ten is a short amount of screen time from Ai-chan. She's one of the girls fighting for our hero's heart and she isn't fairly compensated with airtime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nLoved it, loved it, loved it.\\n\r\nReason for it not being a 10: sometimes I felt that I was back in English class discussing symbolism and imagery about \"sky, flight, and air.\" Also, it got a little too deep. Just a little, though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nDang, man, you cannot go wrong with this one. \\n\r\nFor the cherry on top of the sundae: he chooses a girl in the end.

            "content": "13 episodes is short.  And attempting to tell this complex of a story in only 13 episodes may have been what made True Tears very frustrating to me.  Having read several other reviews about how good this is, about how \"down-to-earth\" and \"realistic\" the show was, I thought I would give it a go.  However, what I was met with was a frustrating and awkwardly paced anime that left me more confused than anything else.  Perhaps it's what's going in my own life that makes me wonder what is actually going on through much of this series.  \r\nIt's not oftenthat you are presented with a story in this genre that presents itself in such a serious manner - that I will admit that about the story.  However, there were several times that I sat confused, wondering where that had come from and what the heck was going on.  There were metaphors and comparisons that abounded in the show, some of them straightforward and others shrouded with weird wording.  It wasn't until the final episode that I was able to understand why one metaphor was continued and expounded upon in each episode.  Without a very unique or original feel, this story truly falls short of being something remarkable and fantastic, with it's main saving grace being it's honest and realistic approach.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and sound do wonders to prevent this show from being some mediocre, less-than-average piece.  Several times, I found myself enjoying the drawing of a scene, the 3d rendering, or just the overall pleasantries provided from the visuals.  One thing that stuck out to me were the tears - they looked and flowed so realistic, so smooth, it looked as if there really was salty-water running down a cheek.  The sound aided scenes well and gave great atmosphere to the show overall.  Several times when a character would receive a phone call, the vibrating noise would make me check my own phone to make sure it wasn't ringing.  Not much more to be said in these two departments, as they can only do so much to help tell a story.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, this section disappointed me.  With only 3 main girls, 1 main guy and his best friend, you'd expect more development and presentation.  One thing that frustrated me consistently was the awkward seemingly forced conversations.  There were times where an exchange of dialogue seemed out of place, not really lending much to progressing the main plot-line.  Some characters just seemed like they \"existed\" in this world, not really seemed an integral, living and breathing part.  I never once really found myself cheering a character on, rooting for some side to win or not.  Hollow, would be an appropriate word, for some of the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nWith several frustrating and disappointing moments, I couldn't find myself enjoying this anime that well.  I'm still rather perplexed as to why it has an 8 overall rating from everyone.  Perhaps I do criticize and critique something like this too much, but I can say I was not impressed at all.  \"Emotional\" scenes didn't cause that emotion within me - I didn't feel like crying at those touching moments.  There were, however, a few moments that will make you smile, but not so sure about anything more than that.  \\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong, I'm not calling this an abysmal show by any means.  Maybe I'm becoming a snob, expecting so much more out of anime.  If you do choose to watch this series, there's going to be something you will like, that much I can guarantee you.  Whether it's the sound or artwork, both done exceptionally well, or maybe you find something in the story and the characters that I don't, there's something in here for near everyone.  \\n\\n\r\nWho knows, maybe I just need to watch this again and get my head checked.",

On my first watch, I failed to grasp all this and see it in a new light. Many qualities of a relationship are expressed in this anime and as such can act as a double-edged sword seeing as how it quickly moves back and forth between conflicts almost like a game of hop scotch and it is difficult to grasp the situation unless you pay attention to the current scene and not on what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Art, True Tears having been made in 2008 by Studio P.A Works (Which was one of their first works) was vibrant and a bit saturated in color from time to time so it made for a pleasant experience even for those used to the most recent anime released nowadays. Although, there are some scenes that are CG for no apparent reason (ex. Numerous Students walking to school, in some cases the Main Character included), can make people think otherwise fortunately, the CG does not affect key scenes in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBackground music... Background music... I learned on my re-watch that the show does not have much background music. The anime is relatively quiet with the exception of the voice actors, but in my opinion emphasizes the mood the show creates through its abstract dialogue (I use abstract since what I received from the dialogue can differ from the next viewer) causing me to really focus on what the characters are trying to speak of. The music is not entirely absent, but there are some scenes that lacked a soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters (excluding one who was mostly used as a catalyst for the development of the Main Character) undergo a slight development in the course of the story. Now this is not a character arc type of story where it focuses on individual characters at a time, but each character receives an even/adequate amount screen time every episode and see them change gradually through facial expressions, body language, or times of melancholy.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show a lot more the second time around seeing as I feel more accomplished after having grasped the show in its entirety and offered a nice break in between currently airing shows.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, True Tears receives an 8/10 from me and should be watched by any romance fans out there reading this.",

The story makes sense, though sometimes it seems extravagant,but that's not such a badthing because this is what the particular nature of the characters involved requires.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly to most romantic tales we kind find quite a few metaphores repating throughout the movie, one of which is naturally the concept of true tears.\\n\\n\r\nIt is very good that most of the episodes happen one after another without any time span between them, it keeps the story alive throughout all the episodes, making it quite hard to throw in a filler episode.\\n\\n\r\nConcluding on the story, it's quite similar to a piece of painted glass one. It is made from mostly simple elements, which on their own are not that astonishing, however as a whole they are amazing.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, the art is very good, but not revolutionary. The background drawing seems very pastel when it comes to colours. Since the story is about people, such a solution is more than pleasing. Esthetically it looks very good, though it does not turn the viewers attention to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of characters is different. They way they are drawn perfectly relates to the emotions they hold within. The colouring of the characters is more lively than that of the background, but it does not disrupt the whole picture since everything blends in just perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department the anime does pretty well. It meets all the expectations which are associated with a romantic production such as True Tears. The voice acting is very good, simlarly to the animation it is individual for every single character.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the background music, the only thing I can say is that it is there, but it is nothing more than the stuff you can usually hear in a romantic story. It does a good job in supporting the storyline, but it is not something what I will remember.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty much a cliche. We have the popular guy, who seems to have problems making up his mind, we have his best friend, who although suffers from his own emotional problems is always there to help his mate out, the girl next door, the girl, who's the childhood fried, and the eccentric one living in her own world. Simply speaking, nothing new, but still the characters are memorable and so are the emotional bonds between them.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough True Tears is nothing new in terms of sound, animation, character design or story telling, it only works on those elements to the greatest detail, as a complete picture it is amazing and inexplicablly enjoyable to watch.",

            "content": "Welcome to True Tears [of frustration]. I might add some spoilers along the way in my little rant, so, if by any chance you're reading this thing, beware.\r\nWhen I first started this show, I had no expectations. I mean, this romance/drama packed slice of life setting seemed pretty common. Then it introduced the whole Japanese animated telenovela plot, with Shinchiro the main character and Hiromi the adopted sister living under the same roof and having obvious feelings for each other, but being pretty unable to act upon them with the whole forbidden romance thing; so to add some more spice, there's Aiko, who has feelingsfor Shinchiro, but is unhappily in a relationship with Miyokichi, aka the mc's bff. I did hear this isn't really your regular adaptation of the visual novel, and pretty much everything written in here is anime-original, but I still have to ask if PA Works actually contacted Telemundo asking their help in building this plot. Ok, moving on, this is where best girl Noe shows up, and she seems to have developed an interest in Shinchiro (besides her interest in regaining her ability to cry which she lost after her grandma died and her weird fetish for roosters). Yay, mc gets all the girls in a harem setting! Did I mention watching on and on I slowly got the feeling this Shinchiro resembles Makoto Itou of School Days more than you could imagine? He is actually that kind of regular high school protagonist who is plain and uninteresting but somehow the universe works to have all the ladies after him, so he's undecided what to do next. Well damn.\\n\\n\r\nLong story (as) short (as possible), Shinchiro befriends Noe, Noe falls in love with him, Shinchiro sees Hiromi drifting further and further away from him, even going as far as to claim she likes Noe's brother, Jun. Who seems to be enough of a siscon to actually offer to date Hiromi in exchange for Shinchiro dating Noe, so there we go setting up two artificial couples (ah, my little sister can't be this cute). Shinchiro and Hiromi are further split apart by the possibility of them being half-siblings, so under this belief Shinchiro arranges to enjoy his mock relationship with Noe and things seem to build up towards them eventually ending up together, after all he can simply work at his picture book and fake any sort of romantic feelings...\\n\\n\r\nHa, ha, ha, only for episode 9 to come along and for all of this to be revealed as a simple lie told by Shinchiro's mom out of resentment for Hiromi (cause she resembled her biological mother blah, blah, blah kind of stuff). Shinchiro sees the open route and goes on to pursue it in the next episodes, which honestly sets every development this show might have had into complete mess. This is where True Tears becomes an incestless Oreimo, with Shinchiro as Kyousuke, Hiromi as Kirino and Noe as Kuroneko (in roles, not actual traits or anything). Oh, and Aiko and Miyokichi have broken up, as if someone cares. With plot I don't even care to explain next, the final episode actually has the Shinchiro - Noe endgame scene bearing massive resemblance to Kyousuke and Kuroneko's final development (including the ripping paper stuff) and Jun breaking up with Hiromi, as if that was to cause some impact. Wee, and now Shinchiro and Hiromi can leave happily ever after in her apartment and guess what... at the cost of suffering a love deception, Noe can now cry again!\\n\\n\r\nI've seen a couple of anime based on visual novels with original plot, but not even School Days with its bloody endgame can compare to what True Tears. A girl can't cry anymore so let's make her interfere with two star-crossed lovers so she can suffer a love deception and shed tears again. And if you call this a realistic scenario, I can tell you not even the most messed up people could ever do something like this. Have a naturally blooming romance that could satisfy both parties and the audience? Why the hell we'd want that when we can have an unhealthy relationship simply thrown in our faces for the sake of a girl's tears? Right? \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude my little writing over here, I'd say True Tears is just one of those shity adaptations of its visual novels, with an overly dramatic excuse for a plot.",

            "content": "Okay, I know not many people will see my review, but as a loyal anime lover and also an animator, I have to warn everyone who is going to watch this anime . DON'T (F word) WATCH IT. It is completely a piece of shit and it's only going to waste your precious time.\r\n  To be honest with you, I didn't even know about this anime. Until my friends told me: \"Hey, have you heard of True Tears? It is the tenth anniversary of its airing. It is an amazing romance anime with heart touching story and lively characters.\" I was interested,then I clicked the first episode and finished the whole season in 2 days. After I finished it I was like: \"Yeah, what a 'an amazing romance anime with heart touching story and lively characters.'.\" I had such a high expectation of clicking that link of first episode; and then I signed out the last episode with the feeling of heating the guy who recommended this anime to me.\\n\\n\r\n  spoilers incoming!\\n\\n\r\n  Basic thing you need to know is the two main girls in this anime: Isurugi Noe and Yuasa Hiromi. One of them was a bitch and another was a fool. Yuasa Hiromi, the bitch, was a person who can lie like nothing to everyone, even to the boy(the main character) who she loves. Even though she still felt unhappy to the boy who \"doesn't understand\" her true feelings after she lies. Nearly to the end, she got the boy, but all she did were to pretend like a pity woman and cry falsely, like she was still not satisfying with her victory and wanted some more sympathies from the audience. I never saw such a shameless character before. Isurugi Noe, the fool, with a weird mind and no one knew what she was thinking everyday. I kinda liked her at the first place, but then, this character just became more and more inexplicable. All her emotional intersection with the main character was about \"chicken\" and \"fly\". I could barely imagine what would happen if a girl talks about chicken and flying everyday to her boyfriend. Nearly to the end, She completely lost her mind and did all random things for no reasons. I understood that she lost her lover, but the point was that she talked and did things so confusingly and no one knew what was she thinking(I can write reasons to explain, but that's gonna be too many spoilers). \\n\\n\r\n  I don't even want to talk about the main character and the rest of the characters because it's pointless. They were all meaningless(Except the main character's best friend. He was a really good character. I gave a higher score of character just because of him). It doesn't even count as romance anime. The plot of fighting and arguing was one time more than the emotional plot. The story-telling was totally a mess, even worse than the trash. The art and sound track was pretty good, but other good anime also can do good art and sound with even higher qualities. In a word, PLEASE do not watch True Tears. If you listen to my advice, you will appreciate me in the future. If you don't listen to my advice, you will be regret for not doing so.",

            "content": "This is Vince's Don't Give a Fu*k Review:\r\nBasically I say how I feel regardless if you agree or not so buckle down for this shit. I will be spoiling and I'll let you know when that big jump happens\r\nLet's make this quick because it's simple you just want to know if it's worth watching or not: It's not:\r\nTrue Tears:\r\nFirst impression: love triangle probably gonna be guy wanting Girl A until he realizes Girl B is better for him even when Girl A wants him. I was instantly drawn to Aiko honestly, I always seem to cheer the childhood friend without meaning too. Noe something abouther caught my attention later on. What it is, is a great question. As for Hiromi I DONT GIVE A FU*KKKKKKKKKKKKKKK She's what I call a carry. As a fan of love stories, this was very disappointing. The True Tears was what I had because I was so disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER INCOMING: GET TO THE VAN!\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlright check this out so we got the main bro: Shinichiro - personally i think he's a bit generic and that's not bad at all. Simple is nice. I'm not a fan of my main characters standing to far out. But basically our bro is stuck in a pickle where he can't have the girl he wants. In this struggle we see three girls:\\n\\n\r\nGirl A: Hiromi [Carry] : So Hiromi in the beginning I understand why she doesn't go for Shinichiro, it makes sense. The problem I had with Hiromi is that SHE'S SUPPOSE TO WIN and that's why we don't want her to win. In love stories its all about the underdog coming through to win. Hiromi just wasn't a good candidate from the beginning, she was set up to lose yet pulls off with a W? shit is weak.\\n\\n\r\nGirl B: Aiko [Carry] : I thought Aiko was a good match for Shinichiro but after finding out she's with his best friend, I didn't have much to say about her. If you wanted to date Shinichiro and not his best friend...WHY YOU AGREE? The lesson with her is nut up or shut up. By the time she realized that it was WAY to late and after her moment she's gone, she is absolutely irrelevant. I honestly have no idea why she's on the cover.\\n\\n\r\nGirl C: Noe [EndGame] : So Noe, obviously a little different, but she does something that I notice that none of the other girls do. She challenges Shinichiro to look at life a different way. She pushes him and inspires him to continue his work. She was clearly the way to go, yet the writer felt it was not the way to go. I honestly think that decision to go with Hiromi instead of Noe killed his work. Shredded in the shedder. Noe was the end game. To see her get the L in this anime was quite painful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHINGS I HATED: (Spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nNoe's brother.... REALLY? c'mon dude she's your sister...\\n\\n\r\nTears were used a lot in this story and I got nothing from it... It may be that I'm not intelligent enough to grasp it, that the tears meant nothing, or it was never actually stated what the tears meant. Why is this anime called True Tears? Noe doesn't cry. Was it suppose to be Shinichiro's tears? I feel if you are going to make a story about something, you gotta make it somewhat clear to the dumbs what the hell you're talking about. \\n\\n\r\nI felt this was a poorly executed anime. I wasted my time in this. I don't disrespect the people who liked this anime. We all have our genre and our types of love stories. This one wasn't mine. I just felt it was weakly done. Please note that I don't have a degree in any type of literary work nor have I ever published any work. I'm just a guy that likes anime and wanted to share what I've felt. Don't take my review seriously. I hope you enjoyed my review and I'm running out of anime! Give me something to watch!\\n\\n\r\nSome terms used:\\n\r\nEndGame: A character that is suppose to make it to the end and farther with the main character - basically the character you ship.\\n\\n\r\nCarry: A character that you ask yourself \"Why are you here\". This character is normally always causing problems or is the problem. In most cases it will always be the character opposite of the one you ship.",

            "content": "True Tears is a realistic and heartbreaking anime with a slightly forced love triangle (square?) and a sprinkling of annoying characters.\r\nTo begin, the plot was quite suspenseful and enticing and the characters were quite likable in the beginning, yet slowly started to go downhill as the plot progressed. The best thing in the entire anime that stood out for me was definitely the cinematography and art, which had a slight watercolor effect on the background and many careful details. For the soundtrack, it was honestly a bit forgettable. The OP and credits soundtracks were pleasant and the songs that were added to set the moodwere okay, but didn't really have a lasting effect. Now onto the characters. BEWARE SPOILERS!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Shinichiro. I personally found him likable at first because of how down to earth he was. However, as the anime progressed, Shinichiro became selfish and honestly, kind of a jerk. He only puts into consideration his and his love interest's feelings and nobody else's. Also, his best friend is always there for him but you rarely see any moments where Shinichiro returns the loyalty. Yes, he does have some good points here and there. He can be kind and he's also artistic but that's basically it.\\n\\n\r\nMy least favorite character, Hiromi. She was the one main character that didn't really develop. How amazing that she plays basketball AND is pretty AND polite AND kind!! Honestly, I feel that her flawlessness was forced and Hiromi was constantly miserable and depressed just because of a guy. ALSO extremely selfish and rude.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character, Noe. All I can say about her is that she is cute and emotionally intelligent. Noe has the best insight and thoughts out of all the characters. She is also very unselfish and puts others in front of her.\\n\\n\r\nMiyokichi, Shin's best guy friend. He was an accepting and loyal friend to Shin and never once wronged him. Miyo is another unselfish character. He deeply loves his girlfriend even though he knows that she doesn't love him because she is all he has because Shin is such a trash friend. Nonetheless, Miyo continues to be cheerful and happy throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAiko. I felt the most sadness for her as she had many complications in her romantic life. She is a bit selfish as she is dating Miyokichi but loves someone else yet her reasons why are understandable. Overall, I found her likable although many found her annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was good and had me hooked. It covered many realistic topics and scenarios throughout the plot, yet the realness of the anime came apart at the end. This anime would probably be higher ranked if it wasn't for the horrible ending.\\n",

NOT weird or supernaturally out of line. Unlike other harem animes that make you feel anxious, True Tears will leave you feeling \"right\". The whole story is so real that you'd wish it isn't to minimize your anticipation. But, that is where the charm of the story lies. You know these things happen in real life... some things are just out of our control.  Another good part of the story is, how they managed tocompressed it in 13 eps. without leaving any loose ends behind. You won't be feeling unsatisfied at all. \\n\\n\r\nI can't really say anything unpleasant about the characters in the story. They were all played out realistically well. The male character (Shiniichiro), deserved to be pursued by women. He wasn't swayed by shallow reasons or by mere pervertedness; in-fact, his character is one of those pure and caring people. Hiromi, as opposed to other harem animes again, is not a psycho. She might have acted a little weird, but that was expected though. If she acted a bit less different, her character would not have been portrayed effectively. Noe's character was amazingly captivating as well. She was innocent and real to her feelings that you'll find it hard to dislike her. \\n\\n\r\nTrue Tears is an exemplary anime that is highly recommendable to everybody. It's worth your time :D\\n",

            "content": "At it's core, True Tears is essentially a harem anime that focuses on internal personal conflict and touching story development.  If you like the sort of harem anime that isn't all about slapstick comedy and fan service but rather about personal struggle and some touching relationships, True Tears is probably worth the 13 episodes.  But be warned from the start, many people are displeased with the ending (I am one of those people).\r\nStory (7):  For a 13 episode series, it does a great job of sucking you right into the story and wanting to keep following it.  There is no shortageof drama, relationships, or conflict in this dare I say short series.  Again, this is a drama harem at its core.  The story seemed very good and I was very impressed until, of course, the end.  That is what really kept this rating from being a 9.  The ending just had no real resolution to the very developed and complex story and left a dry taste in my mouth.  Even after listening to the drama CD and watching the 3 minute \"epilogue,\" I still feel disappointed with the overall ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9):  The art was great in this anime.  There was a recurring motif of art in the series and they pulled it off very well.  Landscapes were gorgeous, lighting was dramatic and artistic, and characters were portrayed beautifully.  The actual animation was done very well too, and there wasn't an abuse of stills that occur in some other animes where the production seems rushed in way.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):  The sound in this anime was fine.  There were really only three sound tracks used in the entire show, but with only 13 episodes, the redundancy doesn't really get old, especially since it is very good music in the first place.  The voice acting was also very good and reflected the characters personalities wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): The characters in this show are very well constructed.  Right from the beginning you get a pretty good idea of who they are, but they still retain an auro of mystery around them that is unveiled as the show progresses.  Overall, the characters are vibrant, intriguing, and make you want to follow their stories.  Character development is also very important in this show, given the large amount of internal conflict, and it is done very well.  As the characters grow throughout the stories, they grow ever more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6):  As I said before, I was loving this show until the end.  The lack of any real resolution to the intriguing story just made me angry.  If you get hung up on endings, this show will just make you mad.  If you care more about the journey and don't get worked up over endings, you will undoubtedly love this show.  I was just left with such a dry taste in my mouth that I couldn't give it a high enjoyment rating.  Again, this is the only flaw in the show, so take this into heavy consideration before deciding to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7):  It really is a great show with great art, music, characters and story, but the ending just didn't live up to the rest, and I could never really get by that.  Again, if you get really annoyed with bad endings, you should probably avoid this, otherwise, I still think that it is totally worth the 13 episodes.",

As the main guy in the story, akagami, Shinichiro, Is a high schooler who loves drawing, His main inspiration to draw, are the people who suffers from emotional depress (they will introduced in the story). \r\nAt the first episode we already know who the main guy will end up with, as what the story introduce us. At themiddle of the story, we are being introduced by this unique, lovely, cheerful and weird girl which you will end up liking her or even loving her as the favorite girl in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is really complicated. At first we thought the girls are the only one who hurt the most, but if you're a guy, you will understand the difficulties of the situation which will end up being the one who will hurt the most. All the girls are likable so that he have a hard time to choose even though he knew who he will love the most. The saddest part is my favorite girl is keep suffering emotionally until in the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love high school romance, you will love this great anime. The uniqueness of the story and the likable characters are really worth of your precious time.\\n",

            "content": "True Tears surprised me in more ways than one. At first I was simply impressed by the fascinating artwork that was done for not only the characters, but the scenery as well.  \r\nPlot:\r\nThe protagonist of the story, Shinichiro is a young man living with his mother, father, and the newest addition, one of his classmates from school. \r\nThis classmate is Hiromi. Her father was a good friend of Shinichiro's father. When Hiromi's parents passed away, she was sent to live in Shinichiro's home. From the beginning, their is a strong atmosphere between the mother of the protagonist and Hiromi. Although Hiromi is as politeas possible, judging by the hostility Shinichiro's mother has shown her, it gives a suspicion as to where the hostility is coming from. \\n\r\nShinichiro does his best to defend Hiromi, not only because he doesn't understand the situation, but also because it appears that he likes Hiromi. \\n\\n\r\nAt school, things begin much less dramatic. Hiromi is a valued member of the school's girl basketball team, along with her best friend, Tomoyo. \\n\\n\r\nShinichiro is uninvolved with school activities, and spends most of his time with his perverted friend, Nobuse. After school, the two of them go and see their friend Aiko, who works at her family's shop after school.\\n\\n\r\nAiko is one year older that Shinichiro and they attend different schools. They are childhood friends and very close. Aiko is going out with Nobuse, because Shinichiro introduced them and told her that he was a good person. Whether Aiko's feelings for Nobuse are true is later revealed in the series. \\n\\n\r\nAnother main character from Shinichiro's school is Noe. She is considered very strange and ridiculous rumors about her are flying around school. In reality, she is kindhearted, but very blunt. In the beginning, she compares Shinichiro to one of the chickens on campus that she takes care of, saying that Shinichiro cannot fly. \\n\\n\r\nThis colorful collection of characters are thrown together through the difficulties, such as life after high school, crushes, and overall, things all of us ave to deal with in life.\\n\r\nI would suggest this to anyone, so please enjoy :)  \\n",

            "content": "Watching True tears was like having your best friend in the entire world give you a million dollars. Then, right when you take it, he/she takes it back, gives it to your enemy and then punches you in the stomach. And yet, despite the knot in your stomach, you're still somewhat happy. \r\nAt least, that's what it was like for me. \r\nStory-7/10 \r\nThe story of True Tears is somewhat typical, the boy falls in love with his childhood friend, she doesn't love hime back, a couple other girls love him, he's not sure how he feels anymore, blah blah. But, it was presented in sucha way that you sort of forget that you've witnessed something very similiar in other animes. And it's truly the story itself that gives you that 'punched in the gut' feeling, because up until the very end, you really don't know for sure who Shin'ichiro will end up with. In most other animes of this type, you can usually tell right off the bat. \\n\\n\r\nArt-9/10\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful, and the animation was flawless. The scenes by the ocean and in the snow were just pretty and they were realistic enough to make you feel like you could reach out and touch them. The still frames were also very nice, and added a lot to the feelings the artists were trying to portray. \\n\\n\r\nSound-8/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were very good--good vocals, good melody--and they fit the feeling of the show pretty well. The voice acting was very good, as well. Each character's voice fit their personalities to a T and the emotional scenes were acted in such a way that made you want to cry. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7/10\\n\r\nI really wanted to give the characters a higher rating, but I had a problem with the development.  They did a wonderful job of developing Shin'ichiro, Noe, Nobuse and Aiko. But one main character really fell short. Hiromi was so under-developed, I couldn't even stomach her as a main character, especially as the initial love interest of Shin'ichiro. We know really nothing about Hiromi, even up until the end. We don't know what she's like really, other than that she's quiet and plays basketball. For me, to put Hiromi in a major role of the anime was just such a disappointment, especially towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-9/10\\n\r\nI found myself enjoying every minute of this anime, even when I felt like my stomach had tied itself into a knot that couldn't be untied until I cooled off for a couple hours (which actually happened at the end of the show). Despite the ending, I was very happy with the anime and I was glad I watched it, and would watch it again.",

That you don't really see in other storys enless its at the endand some times that doen't even happen.\\n\r\nThe art was fantastic, just the way they made water colors part of the animation.

True, there is a visual novel but the only thing the anime and game share in common is the name,the characters and story are completely different.\r\n     Now then, True Tears is a romance,school life,slice of life anime with some comedy but not alot.\r\nTrue tears follows Shin'ichiro(male lead) as he figures out his feelings about the female leads(sorry for the poor summary but i try not to SPOIL things, read the anime page summary for more details:D)\\n\\n\r\nStory8/10\\n\r\nThe story was original but had you questioning some things along the way like sometimes it was just a little tough to follow.

The reason i didnt give it a 9 like many other people is because the anime started off strong and for a 13 episode anime is was executed perfectly.But ut failed to escape the Generic school life romance ending. Honestly i didnt see anyway that it could have ended the way it did.There was more of a development with one character and it went the other way for some reason.IDK it just did but o well i dont make animes a i just watch em\\n\\n\r\nIf you like School life romance slice of life anime i recoment this for you and Remeber the statements above are MY OPINION not yours sooo go watch this anime\\n\\n\r\nReccomend me animes or leave me a comment on how to improve reviews that i type just send me a message or leave a comment on my profile~~~Dezperado \\n\\n",

It does have its own attraction that attracts me . The animation are also good . there were 3D animation on some episodes and it was nice really . I've seen some anime that have 3D animations and whelp , it suck . But not True Tears my friend . here , its all perfect .\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nThe voice actors for True Tears was really nice . The OP and ED was relaxing . I  enjoy the OP the most . its got this relaxing feeling that i actually can relax while hearing it . Either way , i got no problems with the sound\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8\\n\r\nThere are many characters that have basic background but im not gonna touch about that because for me , its kin of a spoiler . well anyway , we have several characters like our main hero , Shinichiro Nakagami , where he seems to be on my bad side (don't ask why he's just happen to be on my bad side) , Hiromi Yuasa , she is the type of person who seems to cry a lot , Noe Isurugi , ahh yes i love her attitude . Noe is the opposite of Hiromi , she doesn't know how to cry anymore . Seems legit enough for me . we also got several characters like Aiko Ando , Miyokichi and others . The character plot are good and all but its missing something to perfect it . Don't know what though....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\nThe comedy , the drama , the romance , just nice . The comedy here sometimes make me laugh , other make me giggle , some are just laugh of silence . The romance here are not well made because its just seem they didn't try hard enough . Its like they were rushing on something . The drama here are well made . I cry and i cry and i cry and i cry and blah blahh blahhh.....\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nAll i can say is that this anime is worth watching . It just pains me to see Noe fly away like that . Now , i want to release my hatred on Shinichiro . Y u no Noe.......Arghhhh ! Noooooooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee !!!!!! *release the tears*",

            "content": "Soap Opera: The Anime. \r\nRecommended if you really liked Anohana, Nago no Asukara, or if you are new to anime. Don't read this review in that case, you might end up hating the anime before you watch it. If you don't meet that criteria or don't care, then carry on. \r\nI hated this anime. Initially, I liked it, but with certain developments in the anime, I became increasingly frustrated. I had trouble choosing between a 2 and a 3 for the rating. I chose 3 to be a bit generous. Take all the unadulterated cliches and tropes from television dramas (soap operas), convert them toanime form, and you get this anime. Most of the top reviews have given this anime a 9 or 8, and while that is completely fine, I wrote this review to present an opinion from the other side of the spectrum. I found this anime to be horrible. This review will contain some minor spoilers. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, lets get the good stuff out of the way. This anime had some very nice art and animation, fair music, and one or two decent characters. That is pretty much it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for the meaty part of the review. While this anime is considered a romance, it also meets the criteria for being a harem. The main issues were with the progression, pacing and the characters. For example, one character's motivations are never properly explained, her behavior just glossed over, and her character does a complete 180 without it being really explained. The main character himself is very bland and obtuse as is expected from harem protagonists, with little real interaction with most of the heroines (well, except one), and is kind of an asshole. The other characters and their motivations aren't fleshed out well either. The anime lost all tension by episode 9. which was not a good sign for a drama. Some people say that the way the anime ended was unpredictable... but it was literally hinted at in the start of the anime. I haven't seen soap operas, but I have read about them, and all the signs were clear about which heroine the MC was going to choose if the anime chose to be your standard predictable drama. I thought it would do something different, and it did; this show managed to be worse than all of those anime with pointless and forced drama that I've watched so far. Over the course of watching this show, I felt it was somehow 'different'. Little did I know that that difference was not positive. Also, the ending sucked. The writers practically tied up everything with a neat little bow and tried to assuage all the viewers. It felt incredibly forced. The anime tried to be 'intellectual' and philosophical using the metaphor of a chicken who tried to fly. Didn't really work that well, in my opinion. It seemed like an attempt to give the impression of depth without there actually being any. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of watching this show, I would often mute the volume and try to see if the things that were happening made sense without the music (the anime plays some nice music at the really stupid parts to try to fool the viewer into not noticing the stupidity of those parts). They did not. Now, of course, some of us (including me) often watch fictional dramas to be 'fooled'.... but this anime, ugh. It failed in even doing that properly. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the art was mostly nice, the use of CGI for extras was really unnerving. Also, I couldn't help thinking that such nice art was wasted on such a horrible story and characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm not one to make use of hyperbole, but I hope I never have to watch an anime like this again. I'm going to avoid the drama and romance genre for  a while because of this anime. You've been warned.  Happy New Year.",

In the end, it feels a little rushed but the overall pace was great.\r\nArt: Every scene was beautiful. The colors were given a tasteful wet on wet watercolor feeling. The character styles were simple yet it seemed to fit right into the background. At first, you would think that the makers would give up on the looks after a few episodes but they carried it out all the way to the end. Some part will make you capture the scene and maybe even make it as your desktop. \r\nSound: Thesound rarely changed from silent. The opening song was great to hear. Im the type to usually skip the openings but this one caught me. On more dramatic scenes, the sound added to the feeling which was also good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Personality wise, nothing was new. There was the oblivious male protagonist, the perfectionist yet jealous girl, the wild girl, and -even though its a little rare- the bestfriend's girlfriend. What made the characters good though was that the girls had the &quot;perfectly worst moment&quot; factor. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was a great anime. Its better than a lot of other romance animes. The artwork alone made this anime memorable.",

Although much of the concept is similar stereotypical anime in which the protagonist much choose amongst the heroines, it truly captures the feelings of a person in this sort of situation. It really brings to life the characters and the circumstances under which they undergo to feel real and makes you hungry for the next episode. The animation is brilliant, and everything from the characters to the scenery is very well developed in order to bring about the mood of the plot. The characters personalities and traits are also very well developed so it leaves the audiencewith something to familiarize with. Truly I think this anime is very captivating and people should definitely take the time to watch all 12 episodes without stopping if they really enjoy romantically animes, then this one will indeed with out a doubt stun you and touch your heart!",

That makes them even further apart and they start to accepting that reality.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the MC meet a strange girl (Girl B). A girl who always cheerful and be herself even though she has been through a lot of pain and need a person to be there for her. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER\\n\\n\r\nFinally the MC and Girl(B) have spent their days, weeks, months together, getting along together and loves each other.

Everyone wanted more, but they didn't hear our wish for more. Read below for more details.\r\n*This story was amazingly written. Every episode went by so fast and each episode made me want to watch the next and so on.\r\n*The story is about 3 girls that like the protagonist. As expected, the protagonist chose the main girl, but for some reason, I, the viewer,  WASN'T HAPPY!!! :( :(\r\n*Japanese writers... I cannot emphasize enough at how much youSUCK at writing good endings for romance/love stories!!!!!!!!  DARN YOU, DARN YOU, DARN YOU. Japanese writers are experts at f***** up a beautiful story.\\n\r\n*The ending was not \"sad\" and will not make anyone *cry*, but it rather makes you feel very very very disappointed in the writer. The ending was not sad, nor happy, it just felt wrong for some reason. *This ending was the perfect way of getting a rating of 9.5 to 8.0......\\n\r\n*Don't Japanese writers understand that if they write disappointing/sad/stupid endings, they will get BAD RATINGS???!!! Can't they understand if the fans/viewers are not happy with the ending, the animes will get bad ratings???? How can Japanese writers not understand that????\\n\r\n*Whatever, I'm tired of expressing how disappointed I am. This story was so beautifully and masterfully written... and yet, at the end, the writer HAD TO **** IT ALL UP by writing a disappoint ending that just leaves you thinking \" what the heck is this s***? Damn it all, why did I watch this c**p. It just left this... sour feeling... this sour impression in my heart: sad/disappointing/stupid endings really really suck! \"\\n\r\n**The story-line, the music, the animation, the character design, the story twists, everything was wonderfully and masterfully done, but the writer had to screw it all at the very end..........\\n\r\n*The ending will leave a *sour impression/feeling of disappointment in your heart*. This, absolutely I guarantee you!\\n\\n\r\n******The anime is absolutely, and definitely worth watching, but just be warned, the ending... WILL for sure leave an *unhappy feeling of disappointment*......\\n\r\n*If the ending... if the last episode had been better, True Tears would have a RATING of about 9.5... but instead, here in myanimelist.net, it has a rating of 8.03 only..... AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY !!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\r\n*I *enjoyed* watching the first half of the story, but then it started to get *uncomfortable*... and the ending leaves everyone with a *sour feeling of disappointment* in ALL of the viewers. No wonder its rating is only of 8.03. So it makes sense, right???\\n\\n\r\n******Conclusion: This anime was simply awesome. But... when you finish watching it.... you will feel sad... and disappointed... and down.... and you'll learn to hate the writer of the story.... No. The ending will not leave you with a happy feeling... no, it won't... so watch it under your own risk... by the end... you will have this *sour feeling of disappointment in your heart*...\\n\\n\r\n>>>Please, if you mark this review Not Helpful, it's alright. After you finish watching this anime, please keep in mind to re-read my review and you WILL agree with everything I said. You may not understand what I wrote, but after you watch it, you will understand :P \\n\\n\r\n...A feeling can't be expressed nor can it be understood with words... so you won't understand what I meant until you finish watching this anime...",

            "content": "True Tears was one of the best Romance Animes that I have seen. \r\nTrue Tears has the general Harem feel, centered around a young boy and 3 girls that like him. The general story outline, since it is a Harem, is similar to many others out there, mainly, girls like guy, guy likes girls.. and he has to choose between all of the girls that he likes. HOWEVER, what made this anime so enjoyable for me was its unpredictability. In many Harem, the viewer can have a sense of who the guy really likes, and his choice is almost always just a confirmation of whatthe viewers expected. In this anime, however because of its short duration, and because of the story mainly focusing on 1 guy and 2 girls(with 1 girl having a supporting role) the character development was very well done, even though I had supported one of the girls in this anime all the way, I was unsure until the end if the girl I supported would be chosen. Because of this, I think that the tag  goes along very well with this anime. The drama that this anime created in only 13 episodes surpasses many other similar animes, it had me extremely curious on which girl the main character was going to choose. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound and art, well its pretty much typical.... though I liked them..

            "content": "True Tears is a typical Romance - Slice Of Life clich\u00e9 anime but NOT a typical Harem anime. \r\nThe story revolves around Shin's feelings towards the 3 female characters, Hiromi, Noe and Ai. \r\nThe reason i said it's not a typical harem anime is that Shin is actually reviewing all the situations and the girls, not just getting together with one and then another. It is a genuine story with genuine characters.\r\nThe story does go on really slowly. The 13 episode anime could've been condensed into a 5 episode series too. The story is actually weak with nothing distinct and special except for its genuineness.However, ing the ending, everybody is considerate and understanding , which isn't natural at all...\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really Slice of life, which actually works against it, as there is no character development. Till the third or fourth episode, i couldn't even recognize the characters or their names.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime has great animation and music.  It's a feel good anime more than anything. A great thing about this anime is a teen's (here Shin's) thoughts and evaluations of their lives is shown (in the form of art). Not many teen drama animes have it.\\n\\n\r\nI picked up this anime in the recommendation column on Myself ; Yourself's page. Maybe that's the reason i was disappointed by this anime, i might've expected too much. So, head's up there isn't much similar to M ; Y in true tears and it isn't as good either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 6/10\\n\r\nPriority : if you have already seen like 25 animes and aren't in a mood for intense, just something short term and light.",

            "content": "Just finished viewing! True Tears was pleasant to the eyes :) I recommend most romance fans to give this try, as it won't likely be a waste of your time! Just try this anime, you won't regret it or much at all.\r\nHere are my ratings\r\nStory: 6\r\nArt: 7-8\r\nSound: 6-7\r\nCharacter: 6-7\r\nEnjoyment: 8\r\nOverall: 7\r\nI liked this anime because of the oh-so cuteness of the characters, and the setting of the art! The art and the story are partners in a mission here, I say this because True Tears gives you that snowy-then sunshine calm vibe, then which the characters help portray in the series. Not seeing any cars,quiet roads, the sea, chickens, and a kid making a picture book about it all. Now, the art is gooood, but nothing special to throw the rest of the animation into high tier...but still, just right! The series just feel interesting to watch another episode, you'll even have a few laughs probably. You'll feel sorry for the characters, annoyed, or impressed. Either way, your going to have fun watching them in here. Cuteness is the name of the game, and True Tears can score some big shots! \\n\\n\r\nThere were some cliffhangers in the series, but I felt like they lead me on because of the way they were resolved. The drama and it's big moments looked to be super engaging, but they didn't resolve those big moments in a super dramatic way..you'll just see mere glimpses of the results from them, they feel like flashbacks almost. No real tear-jerker moments for me, although there were some that had huge potential. Isurugi Noe without a doubt the most fun and interesting character to watch in True Tears, had big drama that was built up on and around her to start off. Later on in the series, she just waved goodbye to generous plot time due to complications, and the complications didn't even justify her to step aside. When that happened,  it felt like a part of Shinichiro's (Lead char.)story sat on the bench, in an uncomfortable way. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were ok, but they were in no way to be associated in a 'IRL' type of vibe, due to the unrealistic nature of their personalities. For me in True Tears, I felt it needed some realism aside from Noe's take, which gave me all the cuteness and appreciation of a character having her own different visions and thoughts.The \"special-ness\" and some of the cute aspects of the series were fading away fast from when it got to the mid parts of the story. I don't want to get into the rest of the characters too much..I would talk about Shinichiro too but I won't bother. So hence the characters plot struggled, which means the story sure did. It was kind of a big deal, but whatever. \\n\\n\r\nThis type of romance had the development done for the characters, but there was no real value to it..idk how to put my reason into words, like they would basically leave you hanging over and over, their feelings and emotions felt more confusing than interesting, big moments didn't really contribute much to the progression of the friendships involved, like they would have a intense conflict/ fight between some characters..and then the next scene they just act like it never happened in the story ever,and the characters themselves forget most stuff that happens in that matter..the juicy stuff. They'll just skip to the next episode like nothing happened\\n\r\n, that's what I'm trying to say, relationships come but only to become merely aesthetic and acts like a checkpoint to progress the story, rather than having the real thing. (Basically no juicy stuff to follow up their big moments.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music was okay. The sounds of True Tears, no real special effects concerning the sounds of the town, horns, bells, people talking in the background, organic noises..not much or none of it at all . In other words, there is no 'sound of art' for me. I skipped the opening generally, and I also skipped most of the time the ending even though it was so pleasant and cute to watch! (It'll make you awww.) Background music doesn't get repetitive, but again nothing special, most of it is not catchy enough to download an OST..I'll skip on that. Voice acting was done just right, nothing much special to write about it, but just nice enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm about to end this review. All in all, I enjoyed True Tears. You probably will too if your a romance fan. You'll just feel nice watching this anime. I don't think I'll be watching True Tears much often again, but that won't stop me from recommending it to others.\\n\\n\r\n7 out of 10 for me! Grace and peace be with you, and God bless you! :)\\n\\n\\n",

Tears in real life are the manifestation of emotions our pain our happiness they just represent the fact that we are humans, if you cry a lot you might be labelled as a cry baby but if you don't at all then you'll feel there is something missing, something which makes you human, When you get frustrated or hurt or lonely and what not beyond point or when youare happy beyond expectation these small drops they represent that feeling of yours, sometimes they can say a lot more that people can actually tell someone. \\n\\n\r\nWell i don't know why i am writing all these but yeah i am thinking what they really are and what's their importance in our life. I think their importance is beyond all the luxuries you can ever think of.\\n\\n\r\nToday i came across this anime called True Tears (anime)\ufeff and trust me its one hell of a ride. Its emotional, Funny, full of intriguing moments that i couldn't help myself but cry, couldn't help myself but shed some tears and now i am really glad that i watched this anime. Thanks Ian Conrad\ufeff for introducing me to it.\\n\\n\r\nAs For the anime here goes the review  :\\n\\n\r\nTrue Tears is one hell of a ride of emotions, they just fly all over the place you can't dodge it, it will make you laugh, cry and do all sorts of crazy thinking as the story progresses. The characters are all well made and i enjoyed they way the expression take you on along the story on kind of a hitchy but for sure not regrettable ride, I really liked the art and story but what tottaly got me glued was the Music. The song Relectia, the opening is so beautiful, i can not stop listening to it and the meaning it possesses is really beautiful, if you let yourself flow with the song i am damn sure you will enjoy it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was good, it will keep you glued and thoughtful of why does the character think like this, what's gonna happen, how can someone be so thoughtful, you rarely experience anyone thinking like that in real life now a days and its really wonderful how the writer has put up the story, the dialogues will just get you, for example when Isurugi Noe says I have given away my tears or when the main male protagonist Shin'ichir\u014d tries to explain to Isurugi Noe that He loves Hiromi but whenever he sees Noe his heart wavers, its just too good. It really made me emotional.\\n\\n\r\nWell i can't write a review which can do justice to this anime, its just too good. I haven't even written any reviews before. I just wanted to write one for this anime because it really touched my Heart. This review is just the representation of how i feel about the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading :)",

Some of you, just like me would think that this would be just another cliche anime with somewhat like a love triangle or something like a romance harem or something relatable to clannad or kanon before watching the show.\r\nBut what I've learnt what this was one of those rare animes which has a strong story line, different yet captivating with good art having a satisfactory ending.\r\nRelationships between each characters take somewhat a noticable growth throughout the show. For better or for worse, it had meaning with a reason. Ofcourse the story is shown on the maincharacters perspective, Shinichiro but it also shows sides of the other characters which draws you in. To root for them, hoping that nothing bad happens to them. Both emotionally or physically.\\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't something extraordinary but it wasn't something I did not like. Sound on the other hand was something that I did like. A lot.\\n\\n\r\nI for one thoroughly enjoyed the show. Not just because that it had such a satisfactory ending but the way the anime brought the ending for me to be satisfied with. And I would certainly recommend to any of you who likes the genre.\\n\\n",

            "content": "True Tears is a better version of the \"fuck this whore\" mentality you get from watching the School Days TV series. Much like other drama fueled, feels-bad romance shows like Rumbling Hearts, True Tears has a right to sit among its twisted sisters on a throne of what-the-fuckery. \r\n\u2022 The beginning of True Tears reminded me of Yoshiyuki Tomino, with how erratic the characters behaved, but it\u2019s fun. One of the two main girls, Noe Isurugi, might as well be related to Kamille Bidan with how neurotic she is. The other option is the main guy's beautiful adopted... sister\u30fcbecause Japan.\r\n\u2022 The male protagonist is annoyingwith how undesirably, indecisive he is and even gets blackmailed into dating someone because of that person\u2019s incestous older brother. No, I'm not making this up. Like many male protagonists, the MC has even his best friend's girlfriend vying after him.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 If you think this is a train wreck, as the story unravels there's more and more bullshit to be had. I think True Tears has the essence of a trashy Sunday soap, rather than your typical battle harem. This show is one of P.A. Works first triumphs as a company, but because of all of the cheating and love triangles in their works, they are now officially called NTR Works, in my mind. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 I mean, look at Nagi no Asukara. I give this one a pass, since its done by the same director that Oniisama e\u2026, (mind you, this guy also worked on True Tears) which is trashy drama at it's fullest. But, Hanasaku Iroha, too\u2026 too many can't be accounted for. I know the script writer behind Hanasaku, Nagi, and True Tears: Mari Okada is to blame, but, now, I seriously expect trashy drama when engage in anything this studio has produced. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 After reading a biographical piece on her on Anime News Network, I realized that she must have had something similar happen in her life. The article even cites that Okada broke down during the release of Anthem of the Heart, because she related so much to the protagonist, Jun Naruse, so one would think that this character archetype would contain parallels to herself. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Naruse is another character that gets passed over, and Isurugi from True Tears is practically the same character. Netorare Works have done other things with less cheating, like Shirobako, Tari Tari, and Sakura Quest, but they still have branded themselves as NTR Works to me, until they clear their names. The protagonist's best friend, Miyokichi, is a really badass guy. He might even make my top ten favorite male characters list.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 No, I didn't forget you, Zelos (Tales of Symphonia). I don't know how he was so forgiving to his awful girlfriend and didn't blame his best friend for any of the complications that he caused. Miyokichi is a true bro. I teared up at how much this guy got fucked over; there was one scene in particular that made my heart sink. This guy deserved the biggest hug out of any other character that I've seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The directing in this series was beautiful. I have never seen the same quality in camera usage and images in other P.A. shows. My main complaint with True Tears is how I feel that with all the build-up, the ending was too soft and vanilla for all of the shock, foreshadowing, and tension that seeped through the TV screen.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 There should have actually been someone who died tragically or murdered like the red herrings in the show led us to believe. I think this series probably deserved more of a death than even School Days did, and that was a downward spiral if I've ever seen one. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 I think a Dead Poet's Society ending would have been welcome, or some kind of indication that all of the horrible crap that happens in this series is a cautionary tale rather than a typical coming-of-age (which it IS NOT). I give True Tears a 5/10 because of the lukewarm conclusion, but I think it's worth watching if you like drama.",

            "content": "My review of True Tears isn't free of SPOILERS, but I try to take a novel point of view in this controversial visual game based anime. I see it as a percursor of almost one decade for 2017 spring's celebrated Tsuki ga Kirei series (a.k.a. As the Moon so Beautiful). I won't say TgK is an adaptation, but the creators obviously took a hard look at True Tears and borrowed what's good from the story:\r\n- The male protagonist is a literary author in both series\r\n- The MC's love interest is a sports girl in both cases\r\n- Both male MCs frequent a folk dance circle andparticipate in the historic festival, where the love triangles culminate\\n\\n\r\n- Girl MCs re-locating serve as the event which catalyzes the relationship\\n\\n\r\n- The female love rival has a major role in eventually cementing the MC couple together in both series\\n\\n\r\n- Both series have unqualified happy end, sort of, which is rare in Japan, due to different culture\\n\\n\r\n- There don't appear to be truly vile characters in either series. Some have undignified motifs, but they are victims of circumstances, rather than consciously ulterior.\\n\\n\r\n- Girl MCs have a kind of butthurt attitude, which may lessen viewer sympathy for them\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand:\\n\\n\r\n- The MC male friend is well rounded-off within the True Tears storyline, an aspect lacking in TgK or only found in it's after-ED comic sketch scenes. Regrettably the sidekick's role is a bit painful in TT, due to:\\n\\n\r\n- True Tears having an unnecessary all-girls-on-MC harem aspect, a leftover from the visual game storyline. This theme is only prominent during 2-3 episodes about halfway into the anime series, but luckily gets discarded by the end and never wades into NSFW territory.\\n\\n\r\n- True Tears has a spiritual depth missing fom TgK, which may or may not leave a hiatus in viewers, depending on personal opinion. Miss Chicken has a mystic air around her, which partly masks the fact she's way too young to be part of any love triangle.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, just because Leonardo, Michelangelo and Bach crated nigh unsurpassable masterpieces, doesn't mean museums discard the vast body of work left by their lesser precursors. Their creations still hang in galleries and visitors observe them on their own merit as well as poining out what kind of inspiration they provided to those giants of art. Giants are tall since they stand on the shoulder of men and dwarves and all deserve praise. Thus, I think True Tears is worth watching in it own right as well as a reminiscent if you have seen TgK.",

Spoilers ahead?\r\nStory 9/10: What I thought was going to be your typical school romance story turned into a really enjoyable story line with developing characters and a twist to the whole scene as a whole! Even though in almost every episode I'd find myself scratching my head when they'd talk about flying, cockroach thing or some other thing that I generally had no idea about.. It was still a good watch! The story line is your typical romance story with atwist.. What I thought was going to be a childhood friend turned lover or a new girl at school turned lover aswell made for a thrilling watch to watch how they all needed each other and how each others feelings affected each other. I loved each and everyones back stories! The thing about them being 'siblings' made for an interesting twist aswell, I kind of saw it coming since I had it spoiled and it ruined the whole thing for me even though it was being built up. I didn't really get the ending either as it was confusing to me about the birds and the flying stuff? Maybe some could explain it better or I might go rewatch it in the future... \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: The art style for the anime was really nice and enjoyable to watch.. I didn't really have a problem with any of it but something just seemed a little off to me and I can't put my finger on it... \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: I don't really care much for sound but the music for the anime seemed like it was thought about alot! Sad moments had good music along with each emotional moments seemed to work out perfectly with the music!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: Originally I started off as a fanboy for Hiromi but then I realized this was turning into a harem type kind of romance anime but it was a low key one.. I still had hope for Hiromi and Shin but then I realized that Noe and Aiko had feelings for him. I didn't really want Noe and Shin to come together.. Their whole situation confused me from the start! The whole thing with the chickens and flying stuff made it to complicated for me and confused me all the time! I did hope something was going to happy between Aiko and Shin though.. I really them together but in the end I was hoping for Hiromi and Shin! Each character developed really well in the anime and I think we got to see a great deal of each character doing it aswell!\\n\\n",

However, the problem of the anime without comedy is it will not be balanced. It's just pure sadness. Yes, maybe the fact that Shinichiro got together with someone at first or Shinichiro got together with someone at the end, but either way, there's one who'll be hurt, and thinking it deep inside would be hurtful, as an anime viewer.\r\nThe anime is so deep, full of poetic lines under the dubs (the voices or I mean, the script) and if you would watch thisas a general audience, you'll not get it at the first or even the second time around. It's just so deep. For me, it's entertaining to 'crack the code' and 'getting the point before the characters do' but as a representative of a general audience, this is an unattractive one.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy much of it, because dramas aren't enjoying. I mean if this is a good anime, 'no one should enjoy this' because it's a very hurtful anime. Not that I mean of saying that it's not 'enjoying' but for a drama to reach the heart of an audience (and this is not a RomCom) it should hurt them and stab them right in their kokoro without noticing.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I'm not with drama on anime. It should be entertaining. Yes, you can put the story but it still should be an entertaining.",

There has only been two other anime series to make me cry and those were Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and Ao haru Ride, or Blue Spring Ride, and that was because I had watched the whole series in two days. The day after getting through finals week, being told my sister was suicidal and self destructive, my best friend's nephew coming home from his dad's house with all sorts of bruises, being dumped, and some chick threatening to beat me up after I got in the way of her hurting my friend who suffers from severe social anxiety. ANYWAYS, back to theanime; this story is beautiful. I had a difficult time with this one. I, being an artist and a poet, highly respect the metaphorical use of each character's abilities/ talents/ interests for the purpose of learning about yourself and those who are close to you. I have been through a lot. My trust has been betrayed so many times. I'm constantly being questioned about my lack of eye contact or my sensitivity to touch and sound. I see my self in almost every character here. I'm the part of Noe who believes so much in others because she don't know how to believe in herself. I am the mom who can't give her trust up. I am Hiromi, who felt misplaced in her own home, the one place she should feel safe and relaxed. I am Shinichiro, who doesn't know how to feel about those he loves or who he loves or even how he loves the people he loves. I see me in every aspect of this anime and that is the reason I love it so much. That and the soundtrack is everything.",

            "content": "Here is my quick review of the series\r\nStory \r\n7/10\r\nThe story starts off with the typical school romance type plot line including the random girl usually ostracized the childhood friend and the random girl the main character seems to know as well as the one friend the main character always has in shonen romance's. The story was done quite well with twists and turns and overall enjoyable throughout the story. You get the typical feelings you do when watching a good romance anime. The major issue is in the last 3 episodes you could say the story tries to accomplish a typical happy ending for everycharacter leaving gaping holes in most character's character on top of flipping the plot upside down and what it was trying to accomplish. It goes so horribly in the wrong direction that it seems unrealistic and as though the rest of the plot was a joke in the eyes of almost all characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nArt was normal for an anime; with large crowds you could tell animation was not individually done and the same character models would be seen through out the anime animated poorly. Except for about 15 characters the art was poorly done. The scenery was also repetitive and was most likely a painting put in the background not allowing the elements outside to show real weather. The weather and water was also poorly animated not showing depth or just looking unrealistic for an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack on top of the songs playing in the background during emotional moments were almost perfect except the wonky music put in during the last few episodes of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n5/10\\n\r\nIn my opinion the characters were mediocre with nearly no back story. The main character of course has all the females liking him and needs to make no effort at all. The other main male character felt like what could be described as an idiot at times; he can't pick up any signs he's never helpful and he always ends up in a bad position. The female leads are typical of a romance anime; childhood friend, ostracized girl and random girl. They show no creative originality and their character changes every few episodes which leaves you with the feeling that the staff altered the original story to try to please every viewer. The characters had nothing special from the art to the voicing to their traits.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime to an extent until the plot was flipped around and the first 10 episodes felt like they were completely ignored by the main characters. It has its plot twists and will be enjoyable until the last few episodes when if you've seen a lot of anime you will just sigh and say \"this ending again\". \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nWas able to marathon all 13 episodes in one day which shows that the anime was enjoyable even with it's terrible ending. I would say that it is worth a watch if you have seen the more popular romance anime like clannad end toradora. If not click on add to my list, put plant to watch later, and watch the highest rated romance anime. Then you can go back to this anime a year later after running out of top of the line anime. This way you don't hit a brick wall for a year watching anime like this one and seeing the same ending.",

            "content": "I just can't bring myself to like True Tears. Maybe it's because I haven't played the game it's based on, although I firmly believe that if you're making an anime out of a video game, you should make sure that it can properly stand on its own. I also clearly do not belong to the target audience of True Tears, not being an adolscent boy, although I do believe that if an anime is well-made, it will be able to capture hearts regardless of its genre. There are many people that have written what there is to like about this anime, so I will concentrateon what there isn't to like so that True Tears will have a fairer representation here.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, a short section on what I liked: at least in the Blu-Ray version, the visuals are really nice. Aside from really clumsy and obvious CG-sequences, the art is easy on the eye and the character design is simple but well-done. Shinichiro's watercolor fantasy scenes are especially beautiful... and that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the things I disliked: the story is dreadful. Even 13 episodes seem like too much because thing are going way too slow. Rather than things going way too slow even, the story is just too disjointed and ridiculous. I'm guessing it's supposed to be a touching and inspiring story growing up and dynamics of young love in a school setting, but all you really get is endless moping from the two lead charaters. You can see the supposed \"huge revelations\" coming from miles and miles ahead through not-so-subtle hinting, but when they come, you end up feeling nothing because nothing is explained about them in the end. You just know they're coming, but when they do, you get no background, no reasoning, no explanatory flashbacks or story to it. They're just there. The plot is essentially a huge piece of Swiss cheese: decisions come flying out of nowhere, vital plot points suffer from lack of exposition, problems appear and get solved without any of the characters doing anything about them. You are essentially forced to sit through 13 episodes of watching the characters mope around, whine, be scared, do nothing, procrastinate, be indecisive, and when they finally decide on something, it's usually either something stupid or a bad decision. If the series were about how teenagers are stupid and helpless, I'd probably have given the show a better rating, because it does a great job of illustrating this particular point, but I get the feeling the authors aimed for something else. The sad thing is, essentially, nothing happens in the anime. It's 13 episodes of going in circles. Even all the relationships stay essentially the same, which is horrible for a romance anime. Even worse, though this is clearly supposed to be tear-jerker, nothing that happens makes any emotional impact whatsoever. Anything of emotional import that happens gets no exposition or backstory to back it up and gets forgotten as soon as it's done. It's just flat and lacks life. \\n\\n\r\nIf anything is worse than the story, it's the characters. I realize I'm watching a sappy shounen harem anime, so I shouldn't really be surprised, but enter the protagonist: Nakagami Shinichiro, your typical Japanese schoolboy, who's quite perverted, very indecisive, an overall wuss and has nothing going for him whatsoever besides his drawing skills, but of course all the girls will fall head over heels for him! He's spoiled rotten, lives in a huge mansion with his mother doting on him, he doesn't have any extracurricular activities, doesn't help out with his family business, which seems a very busy affair, by the way, and his teenage angst is through the roof. Steeping in this idiot's awkwardness is essetially what the anime is all about. It's just really pathetic to watch how the girls throw themselves at him, and all he can do is blush, fret and be down about it. How conceited can you get? The female lead, Yuasa Hiromi, is an unsympathetic passive-agressive controlling egoist with huge emotional issues, and a lot of unnecessary pride. We are supposed to feel sorry for her because of her family issues, but that gets dispensed with in a very quick and unsatisfying manner, and she has nothing going for her just as the male lead, besides her basketball then. Another female lead, Noe, is your typical quirky and clingy girl with troubled past, but she has an endearing freshness and naivety to her. She might have been the redeeming point of True Tears if, well, her storyline amounted to anything in the end. It ends in nothing, however. A pity. The third female lead, Ai, seems to have been inserted into the story just because she was there in the game. She serves no purpose in the anime, besides pointing up the mysterious appeal of the protagonist by pursuing him. However, even that pursuit ends up really half-hearted. Therefore, Ai has no real story to her or any impact on the unfolding of the plot, she even fails to stir up a potential conflict, so it really made me wonder why she was even there in the first place. Cutting her out would have made no difference, really. The rest of the cast is equally confusing and insignificant, especially the ever-pathetic \"best friend\" and evil mother that doesn't make any sense. I give True Tears 1 for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're anyone but a teenage angsty boy, I recommend that you skip this in favor of a worthier title. If you're a huge softie romantic teenage guy, this might be something for you.",

I usually can't find that kind of plot in American series/films I watch, which I do when I don't watch anime.\r\nThe thing that touched me most was how the main character was in love with a girl but had very strong feelings for another, even though not necessarily in a romantic way. The story said you don't have to be in love with a girl for your heart to be shaken by her. There are differentkinds of love that can move you greatly.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot has two guys and three girls. One girl character, Noe, I loved. She's this lively kind of person who can enter your life like a storm and change your life. I loved the feather attached to her bag, guessing it showed she's a free spirit. She moved me. I felt her loneliness. Her brother, the only person she had, had feelings for her he shouldn't. That was edgy and can challenge some of you but Japanese somehow have a thing going on with this topic. I say don't let that get in the way, it's not heavy in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI felt deeply sorry for the other girl character Hiromi, the orphan living in the same house as the main guy. Her loneliness bothered me more towards the end of the anime. I felt depressed. The third girl character, you go through the despair of loving someone but being stuck with another guy with her. That's also something. The plot is not THAT depressing, though. You'll probably like watching it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like dealing with emotions and relationships, this is for you. I liked it quite much. It has 13 episodes so it doesn't get boring and it has no unnecessary fill-in time or annoying side characters.",

And i decided i would write about True Tears.\r\nWhen i started watching this anime i had really high hopes for it and thought that it would be AMAZING! But then when i started watching it i barely made it through the 5 first episodes. But i told myself that i have to keep watching it, so i did. And i wasn't disappointed, of course it wasn't the anime i thought it would be, a 10/10 but it was really good.\r\nStory: The story was really good and it think that therewas a point in True Tears, that even if people seem happy they can be crying inside but you can get rid of those tears.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was amazing! The facial expressions and background and everything was really good. I couldn't find any flaws in it but it wasn't amazing like for example Hyouka so i give it an 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was good and the opening was good, but not as good as many other anime and the ending was also good but like the opening not as good as others. The background music was also good but not outstanding so the sound gets a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character design was good and there was alot of character development in True Tears. When i started watching it i hated Shin'ichiro and his mother but my feelings change later on. So the characters was good but not as good as i wanted it to be so i give it an 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed True Tears after 5 episodes, because the first 5 wasn't as good as i hoped but i made it through and i'm glad i did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i think the anime was really good and is totally worth watching. So my overall score is an 8/10\\n\\n",

I feel that this anime didn't make me get attached to the characters, which is what usually helps me enjoy the show more. I can honestly say that I didn't really feel very much emotion in this anime. Though I can see that an effort was made, I personally did not get that feeling that makes me actually care for the character. The mother was the only one that made me feel emotion for the characters, and that was just anger toward the way she treated Hiromi. AndI didn't really care all that much when they finally started to get along.\\n\r\nThe storyline was also lacking in my opinion. It's easy to understand overall but its not something you can really get into. It lacked... well, drama I guess. One event involved an accident. and I thought to myself \"Hmmm... is that it?\" when I should have been thinking \"OML! ARE THEY OK???\" but I didn't\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was watchable. If it would have had a better plot and character development then I definitally would have enjoyed it more. But I don't regret watching it, some of the clips from here might make a great AMV!!! :)",

            "content": "\"The you in me was always crying. I wanted to wipe away those tears of yours.\"\r\nFrom the onset,True Tears have already sent a message to viewers that they're gonna be in for a theatrical treat. True Tears is a rollercoaster ride that starts slow but catches up fairly quickly with every plot twist. There was hardly any dull moment you can nitpick as the story itself is actually fast-paced and interactions between the characters were usually engaging and heartfelt,partly thanks to the great chemistry within the cast. Most of the day-to-day banters are light-hearted,with slight touches of dry humor.\r\nBut strictly to say,True Tears is nota comedy,makes little attempt at being one and definitely does not offer in the fanservice department. Instead,this anime swings its focus towards portraying a more realistic and less-flashy scope of what you can call high school romance in Japan. But don't quote me on that if it's untrue because True Tears is undeniably,one of the more down-to-earth type of anime to come out from its genres. Every now and then,there are instances where you can relate to,be it an event,situation or even decision-making. Well,if any of what I said above already interest you,don't hestiate to stop reading and get right on to watching it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of the character design,it didn't appeal to me and took me awhile to get used to. But I have to say that the way the characters are drawn, it is easily capable of contorting any emotion-inducing expressions it wants to convey and this alone,more than makes up for the lack of eye candies. But still,it is not the reason why I rated the animation category so high. Might I mention that the fluidity and flow of basically everything mobile in True Tears are just top-notch. The amount of details exercised in True Tears makes for a very natural and smooth experience that is simply non-existant in many animes. Talk about a realistic approach,True Tears is already a big step ahead. \\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending song are very catchy and pleasant to the ears. It's those happy pop song you may find yourself humming along. Voice acting suits their respective character's persona. I especially love the voices of Aiko and Noe. The developers did a decent job amplifying any important moment with relevant music. You might also notice that the general atmosphere in the anime to be somewhat quiet since background musics are few and far between. Overall,I have no qualms sound-wise. If anything,maybe the male lead's voice.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise,True Tears utilised a couple of metaphoric themes which I found a little too cheesy or maybe poetic for my taste but that's just me. The others loved it and chances are,so will you. This anime revolved solely around characters that make the story,thus little emphasis or screentime was given to anything superfluous or unrelated. True Tears is after all only 13 episodes long. Overall,I would say the storyline is solid but nothing groundbreaking. It may be predictable for anyone who has watched a fair share of dramas but still,that takes nothing away from a brilliantly executed ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast are lovable and believe me,they will grow on you. The premise and setting of True Tears may be kind of cliche but the characters' personalities as well as their actions and reactions are very believable at the very least. It is one of the few animes where there really is no semblance of a villian but it definitely is not the first time watching our hero receiving ample affections from the heroines..you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nNow it's been a while since an anime made me lose track of time. From my standpoint,it simply showed how hooked I was as I actually managed to finish True Tears in 2 days. Therefore I'm more than convinced that I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and hence,the high ratings. True Tears is the kind of anime that makes you admire and wanting for more. While not a tearjerker for sure,I believe the story is emotional enough to render one's heart heavy. It's a mixed bag of feelings actually but don't worry,it will leave you in good spirits in the end. I guarantee that.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters,True Tears will make your time spent worthwhile but to anyone who's seeking for a romantic story,this is a gem not to be missed. Highly recommended not only from me but also,by many many others :)\\n\\n\r\n\"And I finally was able to do it.\"",

Although the show has a overall romance theme, I don't really get the happily ever after feelings at the end of this show. So if you're looking for a sweet romance, this is definitely not it. \r\nThere are typical signs of a harem style anime, but the story delves deeper than the typical fighting over the main character. In most romance anime's the main character has an unshakable faith that he loves the person he loves. True tears throws that to the wind and makes the main character question what he reallywants and who he loves. \\n\\n\r\nI was enthralled in the story, but I have a hard time liking this show simply because I disliked Shinichirou, he was weak-minded and although seemed to make up his mind a few times during the progression of the show his decisions always faltered and then seemed to negate themselves. Even after the conclusion I couldn't see anything really deep developing in their future and actually wouldn't be all surprised if the Main characters split up. If I had been the female main character I would always question if he truly loved me and would feel awful that he would always have someone else he loved.",

Never have i hated a main girls as much as Hiromi, Personally she seamed very unlikable compared to Noe, even Aiko seamed like a better character at times. At the end the generic main girl always wins just gave me a really bad taste for what i found to be a very unlikable character girl like Hiromi.Im sure people might find this anime to be really good and i would still recommend you to watch this anime, its probably one of the better romance anime out there, just know i hate Hiromi and Noe was like 10x better.
